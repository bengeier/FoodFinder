{"text":"Favorite place for sushi in Charlotte! We first came here for a sushi making class that was taught by the owner. Great class and lots of samples of their top rolls which made us come back for dinner. The potsticker appetizer is really good and you can't go wrong with any of their rolls."}
{"text":"Go! Inspired menu, fresh and beautiful. Our waiter was great, but look out for the hostess - she asked me to help her set our table(!) and put a water pitcher ON THE FLOOR. Even so, 4 stars. Go!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine that is a chef told me about the place and so I checked it out. Had some of my top best suhi there, hands down a fantastic little place. Sushi guru is affordable and a must see in charlotte."}
{"text":"Took awhile to get our food even though it isn't very busy. Also, they forgot about our appetizer so it came after our sushi, but otherwise good. I had the guru roll (delicious) and the gardener roll (my new favorite)!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you why this place got this review. One: two dollars for a can of warm Coke? That's cool. Two: food came out in waves of what seemed like 15 minutes, friend got his entree at the fifteen minute mark, then my friend got her two rolls at the thirty minute mark, and finally, mine came at the incredible 50 minute mark. How do I know this? Time stamps from my phone's messages. Three: waitress came by to pick up friend number 1's finished food and when asked about where the food is, she responded with, \"we had to catch it so it would be fresh!\". Bitch, if I wanted an update on Deadliest Catch, then I would've watched it on the tube. No apology, no nothing. Cue her walking away briskly. Four: after said question, \"where is my food?\", people behind me get their food (yup, you guessed it, they came in after us) and then it appears the entire sushi bar including the line cutters or whatever the hell you call them, take a shot. Finally get my food, and it must've taken 15 full slices with a knife, equating that each slice of the fish was roughly 3.33 minutes apart. Receive the check, and charged full price. Oh that's cool. BS. There are no amount of words that can depict how angry this place made me."}
{"text":"This was my first foray into Charlotte sushi since moving down from NYC. I was definitely impressed while not having the highest of expectations (even placing an order to go).  The rolls were well made with great flavor combinations (with the exception of the Guru roll which was way too creamy/mayonnaisey). Most importantly, the fish was very high quality, which is the best gauge of a sushi spot.  I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about. I had such high expectations of this place, it being rated comparably to RuSan.
The decor was lacking, the service was VERY slow (15 min wait for a miso soup, around 40 min wait for 2 rolls - the place was busy but not overrun by people), and the prices are pretty appalling for what I got -$13 for a roll that had a sliver of jalapeño and a thin of a sliver of hamachi on top, while being like a less-than-California roll on the inside was the nail in the coffin. I will post a picture of what my roll looked like (too bad I cannot attach it to the review).
Perhaps there is inconsistency in how rolls are made, and we just ended up with sub-par ones, but that would be a problem in and of itself. Consistency is key, so expectations are met. 
I am Back to RuSan. Sushi Guru, you made a very bad first impression."}
{"text":"I have this place another shot after a year hiatus and was very pleased. Food was great and service was awesome. Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because one of the sushi chefs repeatedly coughed and sneezed. Ha"}
{"text":"I'm a tough critic, and I don't believe in second chances when it comes to sushi.  Luckily, Sushi Guru delivered the goods.  It's a little off the beaten path (next to Roosters) across from the South Park Mall.  The room is small as is the sushi bar but the lighting and overall vibe is fine. I've tried every sushi joint in this city and have never felt compelled to write a review.  We had the sashimi pizza which was not only creative, but delicious.  Loved the jalepeno and the guru rolls.  They also offer all the \"traditional\" sushi options.  The pizza and the rolls were $12 each, which is very reasonable for good sushi.  Highly, highly recommend.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing!!!  Very innovative..not just your average California roll, etc.  The staff is very knowledgeable and the service was great.  Great wine, beer and sake list as well.  I would highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in Charlotte! The quality of Cowfish just across the street at a fraction of the price. Their lunch bento is a great deal and gives you everything you would want. Great sushi, rolls, a salad, tempura shrimp, and fresh fruit! Want great sushi without the pretentiousness? Go to Sushi Guru. Noms!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing!! My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte from columbia and were looking for a different eating experience while we were here; something to tie up our excellent trip. Searching on yelp we first found cowfish. When we arrived however, there was a 2 and a half hour wait - I kid you not! We then found sushi guru and decided to check it out. I am a huge sushi fan and was definitely looking forward to it. 
This place did not disappoint. When we arrived, there was a short wait (45 minutes) but hey, it was a Saturday night. Our hostess promptly came out and let us know there were two seats available at the bar if we wanted to be seated there. Of course we accepted and from tere, the experience got better by the minute. 
The menu is perfectly created and written so you know exactly what you'll be ordering. Although the decision between the Caribbean roll, guru roll, or dynamite roll proved to be a challenge, we were able to choose. 
We ordered an appetizer of veggie gyoza, which was amazing!!! My boyfriend is vegan and he was pleased to see options like this. I ordered the South Park roll. It was perfectly cooked and was an absolute pleasure to consume. My boyfriend got the tree-hugger and Caribbean roll. They were as perfect as sushi can get. 
When our meal was finished, the owner of the store came and spoke to us. We let him know how impressed we were and he was very gracious. It was nice to have someone besides the waitress making sure our meal wasn't a disappointment. After that, the chefs behind the counter asked us questions about why we came to Charlotte and were very friendly and funny. 
This restaurant all around was a great experience. I will definitely be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had and a super sweet waitress. We went all the way with a classic roll (avo, cuke and carrots) as well as a fancier Peruvian-influenced (you read that right) roll with black pepper and garlic aioli. That second roll was the best I've ever had. 

Rounded it out with dessert - cheesecake and matcha green tea ice cream.

Everything was delicious and the service was great! Location is goofy but still warm and inviting."}
{"text":"this is not my first, second, or third time at sushi guru. I love this place and I'm not really sure why I've never done a review before. at any rate I recently moved and sushi guru is one of the places that I consistently crave so since I came back to clt I had to have it. 

per usual we were seated very quickly when we arrived and were promptly served our drinks. took a few moments to decide on what we wanted and eventually settled on 2 d'originals, 1 extremely spicy tuna, and 1 hamachi jalapeño. the sushi arrived in a timely manner and was absolutely delicious. the mango in the d'original was perfectly ripe and I have always loved the sweetness that it adds to the roll along with the contrast from the spicy mayo on top (and the wasabi that I add). the hamachi jalapeño was a very fresh and light roll. the jalapeño on top was thinly sliced and added a light kick but not too much. the extremely spicy tuna was pretty spicy but very enjoyable. all in all the fish was fresher than usual and we cleaned the plate in no time flat. 

we also ordered the donut roll which is usually phenomenal but today it was just average. the fruit inside the roll was a bit too tart/not ripe enough and lessened the deliciousness but it was still enjoyable. 

overall I love sushi guru, can't recommend it enough, and will probably patronage them every time I visit home."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Charlotte for the night before the Panthers Game last weekend, and we were so thankful for Yelp. We found Sushi Guru and decided to have dinner their. 
Great food! all of them. Signature Sushi Guru roll was amazing. I had Umeshu (Plum wine) and I love it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, really really delicious sushi, but made me sick IMMEDIATELY. Sick all night long and felt terrible all through the following day. Not cool, sushi guru. Not cool."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent!  I would definitely recommend to someone looking for high quality sushi. Staff extremely friendly.  Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I'm so patient.  The flavors are great.  It's the Size and indifference about just sitting and not seeing anything come out for ages.  I grew weary.  Girl and I have given them many chances.  Won't return.  Rusans never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. I LOVED the old Cyros, and Sushi Guru has some of the same rolls as they did before, plus some even more inventive ones. While the fish wasn't as good as it had been when it was Cyros, it was still better than most places (though trailing Yama and Cowfish). The problem i had last night was the service. I'm pregnant, and while my MD says sushi is fine when from a reputable place (it's flash frozen in NC, which kills the parasites), I still have to avoid high mercury fish. Since I like to eat a lot of fish, it's important that i completely avoid the fish that are super high in mercury, like tuna. I asked for a roll with salmon instead of tuna. It came out, I paid no attention to it (shame on me- in my defense, there was so much going on with it, you couldn't tell unless you dug the fish out of the roll), ate over half of it, until a different waiter came over with a new roll and said \"here's the salmon roll, that one was a mistake- it had tuna\". Obviously I was upset- Mercury is VERY bad for fetuses! I asked him why didn't he tell me right away it was tuna vs letting me eat it- he ran off scared, came back, and said he was wrong, it was salmon after all. Well, i dug the fish out of the roll at this point and showed it to him, as it was obviously tuna. he took the plate back to the kitchen, came back, and insisted again that it was salmon (there was 0% chance that was salmon- not even close resemblance). He eventually took it back and had a new roll made for me (not sure where the original replacement went), but I never got so much as an explanation, or an apology. Or even a discount on the check! 
Summary: the food here is good, but drive past and go to Yama if you have any food sensitivities. There is a complete lack of integrity here- the fact that I was looked in the eye and lied to twice is beyond justification."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good, as well as the service!  Our waitress was very helpful in recommending different dishes and we enjoyed it all!  Much better than most of the sushi we have had in the area!  Agree with some of the other reviews about the location being a bit odd, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Service woes continue at Guru. The sushi is very good, which keeps us coming back -- but we nonetheless are continually disappointed. Tonight one of our entrees was mistakenly delivered to the wrong table. It took more than 30 minutes (one of us having food sitting in front of us, the other waiting) and still no progress on the missing entree (15 pieces of sashimi). When we mentioned to the waitress, she explained with barely an apology, \"When we make a mistake the kitchen puts the order to the back of the line.\" Really???"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Great prices and signature roll is top notch. Wine list is excellent and great management. Service was also very good. Quite and relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I would go back in fact I would go back tomorrow! Loved the guru roll! To die for! Service was fast and the server gave us good suggestions and great service!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to going here and I really liked it!  I got this roll called the wasabi3 but it's only good if you LOVE wasabi and spice (the kind that makes you go woo hoo!);  it had shrimp, crab, etc. lots of stuff but I think the crushed wasabi peas and wasabi aioli made it unusually tasty; I had them add in some sashimi tuna also, which made it even better. 

Also got the pork dumplings which were very good, and the edamame (meh - wouldn't bother).  My husband got the hamachi jalapeño roll, which was good, but not as good as the wasabi roll.  Very tight space, and I suspect the waitress didn't actually like sushi, but the service was fine.  They don't have a kids menu so if you have very young children, I wouldn't recommend.

Probably would be a great lunch place and I anticipate us getting a lot of takeout from here."}
{"text":"Sit at the sushi bar if you can. I find the experience to be much more satisfying. This place is a bit small but that could always change in the future. 

Servers take care of the customer and try the best to make you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Sushi Guru.  I am a big fan of sushi and think by far this is the best place to get excellent sushi.  The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it is a bit pricey.  It is better than Cowfish and a lot less crowded.  I have never had to wait for a table which is a definite plus.  I, too, believe this is the best place to get sushi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte period.  Restaurant is a bit small but the food and wait staff are always top notch.  We frequent this restaurant as often as possible, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I did a sushi class here which I highly recommend BTW but didn't get chance to try the sushi, well other than what I made which was delicious but I am bias, anyway came back and have to say this is one of my favorite sushi places in Charlotte had three rolls and they were all delicious, staff are really friendly, great atmosphere exactly what you need in a sushi restaurant.

Tip try the Donut roll for a dessert different but soooo good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the slowest restaurants I've ever been to.  We were not waited on for over 25 minutes - and I think it was due to a large party and the server was splitting checks.

Our food was average.  Nothing special.  The menu looked nice, but the sushi was not a wow factor.

We asked for things that didn't come out, had to re-ask.  Had to get up to ask twice.  

After all the hype...I was pretty bummed."}
{"text":"I would have to say Sushi Guru has the best sushi in the Charlotte area!

Guru has an awesome selection of rolls to pick from as well as some great non-sushi dishes as well. The staff is always pleasant and attentive. They also have a great fully stocked bar with some great sake. The symphony roll is my fave!!! Good hamachi jalapeño app as well. 

This is the perfect place for a casual night out with awesome sushi and drinks. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"the lunch we had was delicious! service was great & bento box came with a otn of food.  price was really good too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, hands down. We have ate here multiple times a year over the last 3 years. Their sushi is consistently fresh, and amazing.  My favorites are the Guru roll and the Southpark roll. 
The location is a little funny, but the food is so good it's worth it. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time. Spicy tuna roll was excellent and the Guru Roll was full of flavor.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.   Fantastic sushi.  We sat in the atrium, so not sure how the atmosphere was inside the restaurant. Highly recommend.  They told us they're opening. A new location closer to me. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. I haven't had sushi this good in forever! I ordered the Guru combination platter and my mom had the traditional bento (both on the lunch menu). The fish was fresh and wonderfully cut. The miso soup nice and NOT salty like some Asian restaurants tend to make. The guru roll was great and a new experience. My mom's bento box came with shrimp tempura which were tender and perfectly fried. The atmosphere was nice and quiet but we did go on a Wednesday. I highly recommend this place and I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever in my opinion. 
One weekday, my friend and I stopped by here around 1:30pm for lunch, we were both starving because we had just gone to the gym. We stood around the front of the restaurant for about 10 minutes and nobody came to greet us or seat us. Finally some guy that was eating his lunch on the terrace part came and told us we can sit where ever we wanted. We sat down and waited and waited... 
We saw one of the servers chatting away (for about 20 min) with one of the customers at their table. 
Finally another 15 min later, a different server came out of the back and said \"sorry I will be right back with a menu\"
another 5 minutes later she finally bought us menus and took our drink order. 
We were so hungry at this point we chose right away what we wanted to eat and ordered with the server when she bought us our waters. 
My friend ordered a spicy tuna roll and another roll and I had the Salmon lover and Negi hamachi roll. 
By the time we ordered, the restaurant was all empty leaving my friend and I with only one other table (who had already finished eating and were having a meeting)

tick tock tick tock....

2:30pm rolls around still no food. We could NOT understand why 4 little rolls were taking so long to make because obviously we were the only table who have not eaten yet. And the whole hour we waited, none of the servers stopped by to refill our water or to tell us why the food was taking so long. 

Finally around 2:45pm we got our 4 rolls. Still No apology or explanation why it took so long. 
The rolls tasted whatever. Definitely NOT worth waiting an hour to get our food. 

Stay away!! Horrible Horrible service. Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but after getting food poisoning from the sushi I won't be returning. I highly question the food handling and freshness especially since I've seen other reviewers who encountered the same problem.  After being sick for 3 days and missing work from the worst illness I've ever had I would not recommend this place.  And unfortunately Sushi Guru may have ruined my love of sushi forever."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI EVER.  not just the sushi,  everything was inedible and awful; (shumai and calamari) My friend and I both got sick afterwards.  Just stay away.  Much better options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte!  Try the Guru and Fujisan.  Small quaint atmosphere, half priced bottle of wine and sake on Monday nights.  We go several times a month."}
{"text":"Sushi was very fresh and enjoyable. Would recommend the spicy tuna. The miso soup was good and they didn't skimp on the tofu. Service was good. Will go back when I'm in the southpark area again. The only thing I disliked was they didn't have a large selection of specialty rolls."}
{"text":"I went here the first time last night and can say I have not had that good and nice of a time in a long time..
The place is beautiful and the server Brandon had perfect timing at all times. He knew we had never been there and offered all the help  we needed to order just the right things to enjoy.Which we did 100% each roll we had was better then the last ....Just a great time and place..."}
{"text":"Being a new place with a bumpy opening is understandable, being indifferent and unaccomodating is just bad customer service. 


Came in tonight with 6 adults and a child. Arrived at 5:30 before anyone else was in the restaurant. Our server took our orders for apps and drinks and everything seemed smooth.... until anyone else arrived in the restaurant. We placed our food order and watched our server input our orders into their mobile iPad system and then things went downhill. Our server became overly busy with tables upstairs and down and never checked back on drinks. An hour went by and we had received one roll for one person at our table. Our server never checked back to apologize for the wait and the manager continually walked past us without acknowledging what was going on. When our food arrived it was super staggered and incorrect and no one checked on us or asked if everything was ok. We had to flag down another sever to tell them items were missing and items were wrong and their response was exasperation and indifference. They took my poke bowl which was missing spicy tuna from the table for 15 minutes and I assumed they were remaking it. I watched the poke bowl chef leave the station after looking at my bowl and setting it on the counter. I had to ask another server what was happening and 5 minutes later she brought my same bowl back with just some unappetizing tuna and mayonnaise on top. We still hadn't received 3 of 6 dishes at this point and no manager or our actual server had come by even though it was obvious we were unhappy. In fact the manager, Lynn took the opportunity to publicly and loudly berate our server just next to our table even though she hadn't asked us about any issues, and truthfully we had watched our server enter our order so we couldn't see how it was her fault (other than clearly avoiding us- which she likely did because she was powerless to fix it). I finally asked them to just remake my poke bowl to-go because I was over it. Three separate employees came over to ask what was in my poke bowl and I told them each time and each time they didn't write it down. It had been an hour and 30 minutes since we had ordered dinner and we still hadn't received 2 meals. We had to ask 3 people for drink refills and only got 2 drinks. Finally our last 2 meals arrived and after eating a few bites they brought us our $300+ bill and to our surprise absolutely nothing was comped. To be clear, we eat out at least 4-6 times a week and this was the worst FOH service we have received in memory. Everyone in the restaurant who arrived after us had eaten and left. The manager Lyn when she finally came to our table was basically was like sorry as she brought me my poke bowl to go. And as you can imagine- the to-go poke bowl was wrong when I finally got home. I will be taking my sushi business back to Pisces and my poke business back to Deejai. For a restaurant that has another well established location this dining experience was a complete cluster. They clearly didn't care if we ever came back."}
{"text":"I decided to go here since the wait for Cowfish was so long. The service was pretty good, and we got seated right away. The only thing I might have to complain about were the prices. The specialty rolls were about $11+ and my plate was $14. I got their signature roll, guru roll. It was delicious, especially the fried garlic on top. I'm also not a big fan of raw tuna, however it tasted so good in the roll. The sushi here is definitely a good find!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, hands down! Sit at the bar for a very friendly & interactive experience. Or choose a table for a quiet dinner. Whatever you order will be amazing. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sushi Guru several times for dinner, but for this trip, my best friend and I attended the Sushi making class given by the Sushi Guru himself, Cy Santos.  He was both delightful and informative throughout the class.  The class included the ingredients needed and instruction on how to make two different kinds of sushi rolls, samples of the Guru specialty roll, edamame, and hot sake.  It was such a fun way to spend an evening and a great idea for a date night."}
{"text":"GLACER SUSHI. I can't stand slow service. The sushi was great! The Guru Roll is a must. There is a reason that it is their signature roll. But, I'm sorry, I gave it three stars go the the GLACER pace of the waiter. Took for ever to order, we were waiting for a member of our party but after she arrived the waitress took for ever. We asked for our checks and that took a while. The rolls all came out at once which was nice but, at a sushi place were, people order multiple rolls, I always say and enjoy when they come out when they are ready. Never all at once. Takes too long for sushi. The sushi was great! Really really good. But the service :("}
{"text":"Really good food! So many options, the specialty sushi rolls were my favorite, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and it was alright. The tempura roll that they had on their lunch menu was amazing- best tempura roll I've ever had! I got a tempura bowl off of their lunch menu also and it was soggy and the choices in vegetables were unconventional and also there was no rice in the bowl. Everything was overpriced- especially for having a lunch menu. The waitress we had was nice to us but there were two people coming in and she said that they \"always bitch\" and the other staff were using profanities in front of customers. Only reason to give them a 3/5 is because the sushi was THAT good."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place in Charlotte and I've tried them all. The sushi is sooo fresh and their selection of rolls is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously anticipating Sushi Guru's opening in Plaza Midwood. For the most part, they did not disappoint. Since it's a new location, this review requires some detail. This is a very hesitant 4.

Parking- 5 stars
I truly appreciate complimentary valet in any location which parking challenges. Such is the case for Sushi Guru. As a result, the owners were ingenious enough to add a parking lift to allot more parking spaces. I wish more Charlotte business would take this approach. Valet staff were super friendly and provided much care when parking cars on the lift. 

Service- 4 stars 
Lily, our server was as amazing! She was friendly, helpful and made great menu suggestions. We could tell that she had a lot of experience in this industry. However, the service throughout the restaurant appeared to be a bit frazzled. 

They were well-staffed but at times it seemed to be lack of communication between the front of the house and everyone else. Likewise with the food. Our appetizers and meal came out almost at the same time.

Food- 3.5
If I'm honest (and I am), I've had better sushi in town. The crab dumplings were good but not great. I appreciate the fact that the ingredients were mostly crab. But, they seemed to lack a binder and a bit of flavor. The sushi was okay. The flavors in the roll seemed a bit incohesive. I had the Daikoku's Mallet which was not what I expected but paired well with the dumplings.

Atmosphere- 4
They offer a great atmosphere including 2 levels and outdoor seating. It is a bit tight downstairs but I love the idea of street side seating with easy access to the inside bar. 

I plan to give Sushi Guru another go in a few weeks. It's a beautiful atmosphere and great location!"}
{"text":"Great stuff, truly a Charlotte gem. Would recommend  it to anyone. Was in town for business. Tried  it for the first time. There will be a second. Guaranteed!!!"}
{"text":"First visit to the recently opened Plaza Midwood location. This vibrant community is always busy so parking is a premium. Sushi G offers complimentary valet. Nice touch. Place was busy and the wait long. We headed upstairs to check out the place and ran into Jeremy working waitstaff tonight. Very lucky as he knows his way around a restaurant and while our drinks took forever to arrive due to a huge bar back up, Jeremy checked in often. I ordered the Oriental Margarita which was incredible. My guy ordered the gin Moscow Mule. Comes with a big slice of ginger
We started with the Dimico Sushi roll. Tasty but so loosely rolled it was impossible to dip in soy sauce

For entrees we ordered the Teriyaki Salmon and a Raman bowl. Big portions and tasty. The menu is big. We spent the time waiting for our drinks reading all 15 pages. The menu is split into categories from Sushi, Poke bowls, Grilled seafood and meats, etc.  Plenty of vegan options. 

I liked the restaurant. Sure it has a few new restaurant kinks to work out but if Jeremy our server is any indication the staff is friendly, efficient and effective. What's not to love."}
{"text":"Sushi Guru does not disappoint. Some of the best sushi in Charlotte, and the service is great as well. I strongly suggest the Guru Roll, also the Queen City roll is also amazing. The Hana Lychee Sake is also a must. Also the dessert menu is very creative and good. I will be returning...again and again."}
{"text":"The hostess working the evening on 6/16 were rude. It seemed as if they were trying to steer customer away. Someone would come in and say \"table for 2, or can we sit at they bar\" and the hostesses would say \"ya the bar is full there's only five seats. And it's going to be a 45 minutes.\" The customer would say okay that's fine! And then the hostess would say \"well maybe an hour\" like pushing the time back? By the way, there are 18 seats at the bar, not five. And they were not all full. And there were plenty of tables open. Very strange vibes. ALSO a few people asked if they could go get a drink while waiting to be sat (a normal thing to do while waiting) and the hostesses told them all no??? That there wasn't enough room? But that wasn't even true. They were just lying"}
{"text":"Stopped in a little later for a quiet dinner. Sushi Guru did not disappoint. We had the crab salad and the summer rolls to start. Both were very good. The rolls were exceptional with each flavor coming through but yet blended perfectly. Our sushi rolls were also good. The place was quiet because it was late but I can see a lot of noise when crowded. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here one Friday night for dinner. I made reservations but I certainly didn't need to because the place was dead. We ended up sitting outside since the weather was perfect. The service was horribly slow. While we were sitting there we saw a couple go in and about 15 minutes later walk out with the manager chasing after them apologizing that no one had come to take their orders.

I got the Guru Roll and while it was good...the only thing I could taste was the garlic. This place is way over priced as well. Our bill came out to over $80 for a salad, two rolls and two drinks. 

Save yourself the hassle and just walk next door to Rooster's."}
{"text":"After getting numerous recommendations about CowFish something or other I decided to go there, when I went in I was greeted on a Wednesday night by a 45 minute line so I took a chance and went across the street to Sushi Guru.  I have to say it was some of the most amazing Sushi I have ever had.  The chef (owner) at the bar Cy was very helpful and the Sushi chefs working with him were funny and very conversational, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Cy made a special salad for me that wasn't even on the menu and was even better than what I asked for! I can't say enough good things about this place. Small (quaint) seating area but it gives a very intimate feel to the place.  I had the Southpark roll, the Hamachi Jalapeno roll and the Guru roll.  All three were amazing in flavor, although, of the three, the Hamachi was my least favorite. 

I highly recommend this place and I will definitely come back the next time I am in town.  Thank you Cy for an amazing experience and I can't wait to see you guys next time. Oh and by the way the waitress was great, never left my glass empty and stopped by just the right amount of times to check on me."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with my first go round. I had high expectations with them being voted best sushi in CLT. My salmon didn't seem that fresh. The roll in general was small and tasted a bit off. I'll probably try them again but with better sushi options nearby it might not be for a while."}
{"text":"This place is my and the hubby's favorite sushi place in Charlotte. The service is always great and they are willing to accommodate any special requests you may have. The fish is fresh and the rolls are consistent. We don't see a huge need to try different sushi places since we've found this spot."}
{"text":"To quote my brother, \"Sushi Guru makes other sushi taste like gas station sushi.\" I go in and out on sushi binges, I'm in a binge right now. One order of the Jalapeno Hamachi roll and my craving is cured.  It has a citrus sauce and sesame seeds, seriously I cannot step foot in SG without ordering one. I just want to yell it when I walk in, like they yell at Five Guys. \"SINGLE BURGER!\"

The main reason Sushi Guru is my favorite, the rice is warm and the fish is room temperature. I hate a cold bite and sometimes even at the nicest, fanciest place serve cold rolls. \"GO CHECK IT OUT!\""}
{"text":"Went to a move in South Park and was starving after and only had so many choices still open and luckly Sushi Guru was open and available right away!  Love the service there, have never had a bad server and the sushi is always on point. I got the specialty salmon roll and tuna tataki - fresh and yummy and fast! I think Sushi Guru is my official go-to spot whenever I have that sushi craving."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new location for a late lunch. Service was great. Not overbearing, but perfect. Never interrupted and never had to ask for water or a question. That's a skilled server who has that skill. Ordered two drinks that were unique and tasty. The margarita and the another with a cucumber wrapped around the inside of the glass. Great taste and chilled for a hot afternoon. The food was delicious. Seaweed salad, yellowtail, seared tuna, shrimp, fresh poke cocktail, and a duck breast I'd kill a man for if it were the last one left. :) Yes, that good. For sure will return. Did I mention the duck?"}
{"text":"Plates were scratched and looked dated. Service was slow. Sushi was just ok, nothing spectacular. Dessert was horrible as it was fried in the same oil the shrimp tempura was cooked in. Not worth the $$$. Def a lot better places in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  We ordered what our server said was their \"best\" sushi rolls, and we're underwhelmed by them.  We decided, after tasting them, that we would get our bill as soon as possible so that we could hop over to Tsuki for their half-price sushi.  (This was a Tuesday.) The rolls we ordered at Sushi Guru were $14 & $15 - definitely not worth it.  As others have mentioned, the service was very slow.  We weren't in the car very long before I got violently sick.  I had eaten a roll that my husband hadn't.  We called this restaurant to let them know, to possibly prevent others from eating what I had.  The woman who answered said that the manager told her that he was \"too busy\" to talk to us!  (This was a Tuesday night & the place was less than a third occupied.). She said he told her to get our name & phone number & he'd call tomorrow.  We were never contacted.  This says a lot about what kind of a person he is.  NEVER again will we eat at Sushi Guru, and we'll warn all of our friends."}
{"text":"Been here twice and can't believe I haven't gone more times than that. It's not the cheapest sushi in the city but definitely the best priced for the quality you get. It's hands-down my new favorite sushi place and can't wait to go back and try more of their rolls. The service is fantastic and it's got a nice ambience so don't be scared by the exterior when you stop by. Remember, it's all about the fish and theirs is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Sushi Guru -- Or, what I like to refer to as, \"Underground Sashimi Palace.\" Whether it's a fitting moniker or not, I don't care. On the outside, you feel like you're walking into some corny shopping plaza. Then, upon entering, it feels like some mid-century gothic village -- et al designs and flooring. 

Then, in the corner, you notice Sushi Guru. Just minding its own business and waiting for you to crave sushi and sashimi. I've only ever been for lunch, but every time has been better than the last. 

From the requisite house salad with ginger dressing to the simple maki, it's a home run every time. Service is great and the prices are always rather fare. Upon my most recent visit, a colleague and I opted for one of the lunch platters, as well as a few additional maki rolls. Of worthy note were the spicy tuna (good amount of heat) and the softshell crab roll. Goodness gracious that was one flavorful roll of sushi. The presentation couldn't have been more spectacular with all of the crunchy crab posed as if it were crawling out of the rice and nori. I loved it. 

Definitely one of my favorite options for sushi and sashimi in Crown Town. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Since converting my wife from a 'I don't eat fish' person into a Sushi lover (quite a feat if you ask me), we have been on the never ending quest to conquer all of the sushi places in Charlotte in order to find the best rolls in the city! My wife and I came in on a Thursday night and were met with courteous, quick staff and some great sushi rolls. Overall for the price compared to the experience, I think the sushi game in Charlotte is a little stronger than what this place has to offer. 

You can't miss it from the street as they have a giant neon sign. When you walk in, you find yourself in a quaint shopping mall with some hallway seating and a fountain. The restaurant is just to the right. It's a relatively small place, but had a neat bar where they rolled the sushi.  

When you are searching for the best Sushi, you get straight to the point and skip the appetizers. We ended up getting the spicy salmon roll, queen city roll, and guru roll. The QC roll was pretty good, but was put to shame by the guru roll. It would easily be my recommendation.  Price point was close to $15 a roll, so be prepared to spend a little bit. I found this place from the Yelp reviews, but left with just a mediocre feeling. Since service was relatively good and they do have some creative rolls, I hope to come back and try this place again one day soon."}
{"text":"I took an introductory sushi-making class at the restaurant and could not have had a better time.  Executive Chef Cy Santos taught the class with a passion for the craft of making sushi.  He clearly explained how to make it and stressed the importance of how you need to continually practice to get better at the craft.  

Many other chefs who worked at the restaurant were also available for assistance.  

I made and enjoyed eating the most delicious sushi I have ever tried.  I highly recommend taking this sushi class or simply coming in to enjoy the delicious, premium quality sushi."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to check it out. They have COMPLIMENTARY Valet Parking, so don't even waste your time trying to scope out parking in the area. We were seating immediately upon arrival, but the place was rather small from what I saw downstairs. They might have seating upstairs as well, not completely sure. 

For an appetizer, we got the Pan Fry Crab Dumplings. They were yummy and really just reminded me of something you can find at a Dim Sum restaurant. I ordered the Ves's Roll, it contained everything a seafood and sushi lover can want in one roll. The presentation was beautiful, but this dish did not come with wasabi or ginger which may or may not be intended. First couple pieces melt in your mouth. However, there is so much mayo and creaminess on the roll that as you eat, you get sick of eating it. I still really liked the roll, but the mayo overpowered all the other pieces in the roll and I lost sense of what was in it. 

Dessert for us was a jumble of confusion. We got Halo-Halo, a yam based ice cream dessert with a variety of fruits over evaporated milk and ice. Someone tell me we got green tea ice cream? I'm not sure if this was a spin off of the traditional Halo-Halo or they just ran out of taro ice cream. One of the main reasons we came was for this since it is not found at any other restaurants that we know of in Charlotte! 

Service is kinda slow. Our waiter liked to stroll, but it's okay he was friendly. Their menu selection is expansive so prepare yourselves!"}
{"text":"I've always  knew that there was a sushi restaurant near South Park but I never really figured out where it was... oh...it's inside the building, behind Roosters! 

My husband and I decided to try it out on a Friday night.  It wasn't very busy (which can be worrysome  - it is a Friday night!) and we were seated right away. 

We started off with the salmon pizza, which was fun and tasty.  We also had the Guru Roll with lump crab.  Anything with lump crab piques my interest.  Our server was attenative and came by often. 

I was glad to find someplace other than Cowfish in the area for sushi. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been excited to try this place but 2 out of 2 times trying to go, I was not able. The first try, I went at 2p and they were closed due to a maintenance issue (totally understand). The second time, they were closed at 2p and I was told they were \"working on their hours\". I also understand that but makes a little apprehensive to try again. Hopefully they get everything figured out..  ended up at Akahana."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been looking for a great sushi restaurant and YESSSS WE'VE FOUND IT! Parking is pretty packed around 7:30pm on a Friday night and It is a little small BUT the sushi is AMAZING! We were seated within seconds and we chose the bar. The entertainment was great and we haven't even ordered yet. The Chefs were really talkative and great at multi-tasking. The service was amazing and our server was really funny and knew how to sell his sushi. I Chose the GURU ROLL!  
The best DAMN roll I have ever tasted! Another recommendation from the comedian server of ours was the SOUTHPARK Roll. You have to try the Guru and the South Park roll to satisfy your night. The last thing you should try IF you have room in your stomachs is the DONUT ROLL which looks like a roll but fruity and delicious! The cocktails called the Green Hornet and Watermelon was amazing. It tasted like paradise! Very clean and also a great place for family. We will be coming back! We have found our favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! And yes it does live up to the expectation of Best sushi Restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! The outside of the restaurant threw me off a little bit but the sushi is delicious! Very fresh with a wide variety of rolls. They have some very creative rolls as well."}
{"text":"Take out experience should have been embarrassing for the Sushi Guru. We called at 7:22 pm and were told we had to pay in advance and it would take 20 minutes. I arrived at 7:45 pm and was told that it was not ready, but the ticket was ready to be signed. I signed it and then waited another almost 30 minutes in the outside lobby. I was told they had new chef's and that is why taking so long. Then told that they plated it for eat in. The ticket clearly showed take out. Granted i was offered a free appetizer, but at that point, i was sure it would only add time. The man who finally came out with it could only say sorry....that is probably all he could say. I told him my first and last visit so its his loss. Stay tuned for if the food is any good."}
{"text":"Really fresh sushi and sashimi.   Omasake is the way to go to get the best of the Chef's choice.   Uni with quail egg was amazing.   Hamachi sashami was melt in your mouth.   Try the squid salad too.  Hidden gem of a place.   

We moved here from NY and have been looking for a great Japanese sushi place.   So far, this place comes close."}
{"text":"Food was great, but with most newly opened restaurants, they still have somethings to work out. 

We would definitely eat at Sushi Guru again to see if improved."}
{"text":"I've been back to Sushi Guru now about 8 times. Each and EVERY time I get their Signature Sushi Guru roll, just tempting them to have an off night. Well, they haven't! That roll STILL IS UBER AWESOME! I've tried now for months to find a BETTER sushi shop. Please IF you know of one BETTER than Sushi Guru, PLEASE let me know! I've tried Pisces, Enzo, Ru San, Room 112.....all really good, but none better than Sushi Guru. Maybe because that Guru Roll is so DAMNED GOOD? It floats my boat.

Before you tell me your Sushi place is \"better,\" please make sure you've tried the Sushi Guru Roll so we can compare apples to apples, OK? I really am looking for competition to this place......just to see IF it can be beat. So far Sushi Guru is the UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF CHARLOTTE! WOO HOO! :-)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Make sure you get there early enough to get a seat because the restaurant does get fill up quick. Hamachi Jalapeño roll was delish"}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Guru for the first time and enjoyed some Samurai rolls. My partner got the dynamite rolls that had a bit of a kick if you like spicy rolls. The servers were really attentive and friendly. For desert we had fried cheesecake with green tea ice cream. The green tea flavor was not overpowering the cheesecake was fried and still warm when served
 The manager walked over to ask how satisfied we were with the meal. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Charlotte, and it's not even close.    Sit at the sushi bar for a more interactive experience, and Cy (the owner) is great conversation and will often surprise you with something off menu that's awesome."}
{"text":"Food may be good but, I wouldn't know. Took 5 mins to get a menu, 15 to order and after 45 mins of waiting the waitress says they haven't started our food and we'll be waiting another 20 mins. We left. No thanks."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing, but I only give a 3 because of accessibility issues. The way to get in has stairs and there's no ramp to get down. The location's not up to the ADA code. The only way to get in is to go through the restaurant next door and go all the way through it which is rude and you shouldn't have to go through all the hassle. I hope this gets resolved because the food is great."}
{"text":"This place has amazing sushi rolls.  They have all your classics, but where they really hit home is with their innovative house rolls.  Even the garnishes were amazing and beautiful!  I had the Fujisan, an eel and Fuji apple roll with eel sauce and the sweetness and the crunch were perfection.  It truly made my mouth water.  

My husband opted for the Omakase, a one of a kind meal where the chef comes out and asks you your likes and dislikes and creates you a signature meal.  From the mango-tuna salad to the amazingly freshly mussels (best we've ever had in Charlotte) to the salmon tartare, my dear hubby was pleased with everything that came on his plate.  

Beyond that, the service was wonderful, and everyone was truly kind and helpful.  The chef even came and talked with us for awhile after our amazing dinner.  Too many sushi bars in Charlotte go for the fast and loud attitude, but Sushi Guru is opposite and in the very best way.  Laid back and quiet, it's a great place to have a meal with friends and actually hear the conversation. 

This will be our go-to sushi place from here on out.  I look forward to trying all the other unique and wonderful rolls on their menu!"}
{"text":"What an awesome and neat place this is. There is upstairs and downstairs seating, and they have those cool garage door glass windows. The summer breeze on a cool night sets a lovely tone for the restaurant.

I highly recommend the miso ramen and the guru roll. Everything is well crafted and fresh. Most definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm struggling between giving 4 or 5 stars. I went on opening night and there are definitely some kinks that need to be worked out. The drinks, Oriental Margarita (super delicious), made the wait a little more bearable. The location is super adorable! The building is tucked away which made sitting outside of the garage doors enjoying the cool summer breeze perfect. Also, the food we received (remember, a couple of kinks need to be worked out) was pretty good. I would definitely recommend the Guru roll and the Ves' roll. Despite the kinks, this place is definitely worth trying again!"}
{"text":"Considering that they go fish for the salmon and tuna during your sit  down, the sashimi is super fresh! I appreciate the quality, but they can use some improvements in expediting the food. Not sure how there could be 5 chefs behind the counter and only a few customers and it take so long to serve cold food? To make up for the slowness, they brought me a partial of my order, but I'd prefer to get all of it at once so that I can enjoy it with my company. Just not cool."}
{"text":"Really delicious!  Skip the hour long wait for Cowfish and enjoy the Fujitsi Roll, Guru Roll, octopus carpaccio and Treehugger Roll.  We will absolutely return!!"}
{"text":"I went there on Sep 01, 2012 with my gf. The Sushi was very tasty; the Ceviche is a MUST for raw fish lovers! We also had the Southpark Roll and it was very good, fried sushi so it's a little unhealthy but at least it's filling (unlike normal Sushi). The Rainbow Roll was not bad but I wouldn't repeat it. It's a bit small restaurant but the atmosphere is nice and quite; and prices are not bad for Sushi at all. Overall, I'm a fan and would go there again"}
{"text":"This was such an awful experience!! I wish I could give 0 stars. I arrived around 6:50, at 8:49 I still had no food, I'd only seen my waitress twice,  she gave no refills on drinks and kept walking past us. When I was finally able to stop her she said the kitchen was backed up, but then proceeded to bring all the tables around us food. After I asked her again she claimed the kitchen\" lost our ticket\" - I don't believe she put it in; and we'd have to wait at least another hour. I asked why we weren't priority after waiting almost 2 hours and she just said she didn't know. She offered no other solution. I wanted to speak with the manager but the hostess was no where to be found to ask for them. This experience was so horrible. I would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"How does this place have multiple good review's? The food was mediocre at best.  We were sat and abandoned.  The waitress after I had requested we get waited on sat and told us about how busy her day and the restaurant was. She had minimal understanding of Japanese food in general. The food came out wrapped in foil (Sushi) after an hour wait and no apps ever arrived. I ordered tea and she proceeded to tell me it was fancy tea..The manager was very apologetic but the entire staff we encountered was full of excuses and strangely casual conversations about how crazy their day had been in a seemingly moderately busy restaurant.  I have never left such a review but I had a friend in town and we were excited for a new sushi spot in Plaza. No way I would come back."}
{"text":"Simply the best! Always go for the GURU roll:)
Oh and the Tuna and avocado appetizer is simply amazing."}
{"text":"So I think I have found a close contender to my beloved Pisces.  Sushi Guru provides fresh, in-house made, and creative sushi rolls. I had to contain myself from ordering one of everything!

It's a small little place tucked away in the shopping center across the street from Southpark mall and located alongside Rooster's. When you enter, you step into this open courtyard area with the restaurant entrance to the right. It's pretty small on the inside. When my friend and I went early on a Saturday evening, we were able to choose our on seating. 

I went with the orange crush (which was one of the drink specials that night) for my cocktail, edamame for an app, and went with the guru roll based on the raves found here on yelp. The cocktail and edamame were all right but the guru roll was the true star. Heaps of flavor and deliciousness. 

I know, if you're in the area and craving sushi, Cowfish is the spot du jour for the area but I STRONGLY SUGGEST stopping into Sushi Guru because most likely Cowfish will have a ridiculous wait time. At Sushi Guru you'll be met with inventive and delicious sushi rolls."}
{"text":"So disappointing. We ordered a spicy tuna roll and their Guru roll. Both had very tiny cuts of fish especially the Spicy Tuna roll which they should rename the cucumber roll---see picture as reference. We said something to our server who passively said yeah there usually is more but didn't really make much an effort to take it back."}
{"text":"Went here at 9:20 on a thursday night and online it says they are open until 10pm. When we walked in they said they are already closed. Why put 10pm when u actually don't close at 10pm? Why mislead people. Doubt the food is actually that good here. Don't even wanna come back."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!! This was our first time there we were anxious to try it! We started with the shrimp spring rolls which were good, but nothing to write home about. 

But the sushi... Oh the sushi! We had the Wasabi rolls after reading a friend's review & they were amazing! Some bites gave you the kick of wasabi more than others! The fiery rolls were delicious with a thick cut of tuna and avocado. We also enjoyed the Guru rolls which was a unique combination & topped with fried shallots & garlic! We also got hamachi jalapeño roll that was fresh, citrusy & delicious!! 

We have definitely found our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, homemade chili sauce made to your heat level, fresh sushi, and Hall & Oates on the speakers! Perfect! Try the Fuji apple sake and the spicy tuna rolls!

3/25/16 update - still excellent sushi. Enjoyed the calamari today, which was seasoned perfectly and crispy. Tried the sashimi pizza with sliced tuna. The textures and flavors are to die for. And had my favorite roll, the guru roll. Seriously the best place for sushi in town."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in Charlotte, but this was our first time here last night. Without a doubt, it is now my favorite Sushi restaurant in Charlotte. Wow. We had their signature roll, the Guru Roll, and it was heavenly. The Dynamite Roll was just that. The nigiri pieces were HUGE and very fresh. And, when they said \"spicy\" tuna and scallops, they meant it. That's a rarity. Only 4 stars because it is a bit pricey, and the ginger dressing on the nice-sized salad was all clumped on the top and hard to mix into the whole salad. It's a small place, but well worth a visit for a nice occasion."}
{"text":"New favorite sushi spot!
Just moved to the Southpark area, and had to try this place out. My husband and I were not disappointed. We've been several times within the past few months, and have had great service, and amazing quality sushi! Great date night spot."}
{"text":"Came here the first week it opened. Place is way overpriced for what you get and ambiance doesn't cut it. Not a diverse menu. Drinks were weak. The owner was busy mingling with some tables and doing shots which caused other tables to be left out and not feel wanted in this establishment. Surprised this place is still in business after 3 yrs. hopefully they've works out the kinks."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! I always come back to this restaurant whenever I am traveling for work. The presentation is always beautiful. I love sitting at the bar so I can watch them make the rolls. The food is better than CowFish. 

My server was very attentive and recommended rolls to try. I had the Guru roll with Crab meat and they didn't skimp on the crabmeat. The owner came over to make sure everything was good and he was very friendly and polite. 

I would highly recommended this restaurant if you are in the area. Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh, innovative sushi rolls. Friendly service. The menu was extensive and there are still many items that I'd like to try. I have four mini sushi-eaters so the price was also reasonable! I have only ordered takeout and it seems hopping. I look forward to testing it out \"in-person\" without the kiddos. Maybe an in-person experience will help it earn a 5th star... The sushi was very, very good, but I have had better in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this new sushi spot at all. Don't let it fool you with its trendy look. Here are a few reasons why:
-our server was clearly not familiar with iPad he was using to put our orders in and he didn't know the beers that were a available. Telling my boyfriend they had corona and Heineken and they had neither. 
-our appetizer came out very last even after our entrees and we were still charged for it
-my two rolls came out first and took over 40 minutes and my boyfriend didn't even get his rolls till I was done. 
-on TV were fish being gutted with the intestines being pulled out which did not make me want sushi at all."}
{"text":"Very clean eating and consistent with their quality of fish and service.  We come here every now and then and always our first choice in Charlotte.  Will return!"}
{"text":"I was passing through town on my way to South Carolina for sports business, as usual and was craving sushi so I went to the Cowfish. There was a 2.5 hour wait, so I decided to go across the street and try Sushi Guru. I actually walked past the place because it is in the right corner of the building.
I was quickly seated seeing their was hardly nobody there at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I asked the waitress the heat difference between the spicy tuna and extremely spicy tuna. She responded with \"It's hot.\" I thought to myself, duh, but what would the heat level be compared to? Anyways I got the extremely spicy tuna, Philly, crunchy, and California rolls. The extremely spicy tuna was hot but not what I'd call extremely hot. The Cali roll was a Cali roll, and the Philly was a Philly, nothing special. The crunchy roll and rolled in potato chips and fried instead of tempura flakes. It had an interesting taste and was pleasing. They are a sushi bar that loves to pack the cucumber in their rolls which overpowers the flavor in your mouth. 

The big negative is they don't have a fountain soda machine, They serve you cans. Don't know if they charged by can like Ru-San's because I only had one, and the waitress checked on me twice in the 30 minutes I was there. That's bad seeing the final 10 minutes I was there I was the only one there.

Overall Sushi Guru is O.K., and is a good backup plan if you wanted to go to the Cowfish and they have an eternal wait, and in need of a sushi fix."}
{"text":"For the location that it's in, you'd expect to walk into a nicer looking restaurant. 

We called to find out if there was a wait on a Saturday. The hostess replied no. 

When we arrived to Sushi Guru, the hostess asked us if we have reservations. I answered no. She told us to wait so she can find out if there's any seating available. (Which was strange because we called 5 mins prior) 

After I mentioned I called and was told 5 mins ago there was no wait, she brought us to our table. She was nice about it, but it was odd. There were plenty of tables open. 

The waitress we had seemed very \"New\". Wasn't very suggestive at all. Sushi was decent. Nothing too special.
Maybe we didn't order the best rolls. 

There are a lot of sushi choices though and I believe this place has potential."}
{"text":"Danny is a god of sushi. Between the stuff that he just has you try and all the items that he had in his name sake.   Do not be confused by entrance to the  restaurant.   It's is worth coming in and bellying up."}
{"text":"Not great service and we went at 4:45. Sushi was ok nothing great. I didn't like it. The other people I was with thought it was ok. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"12/07/2016
Hidden gem by South Park Mall. Located right next to roosters.
Its a small and sophisticated sushi restaurant. 

Our server was great and the sushi chef behind the bar 

We ordered handrolls - spicy tuna, yellowtail scallion, and benjamin's tuna avocado. I loved all of them except the benjmains tuna avocado, it just did not taste good together for some reason. 

The yazzy snazzy roll was sweet and good! Its \"yellowtail scallions with avocado and tempura flakes topped with flame seared spicy white tuna drizzled with eel sauce topped with crispy shallots, crab roe and scallions\" see the picture. 

The chef did gave us several free nigiris and we ordered a bottle of their house pinot grigio (est $30) and with the additional food we received. It was just enough!

I would definitely recommend coming here and definitely will go back when I go home."}
{"text":"I have seen this joint forever, because it is nestled in the back corner from Rooster's, but I have never been in. The hubs and I tried eating at Yama, but was closed due to MLK day.  So, we went to the Guru. I'm going to be honest and tell you that I was more than skeptical, because it didn't look very clean, and even though we really enjoyed the sushi, I still think it could use a good scrubbing and freshening up. It's a small establishment, with well-placed tables, including some bistro tables, for maximum seating. We were seated at a bistro table by the window, but ended up sitting at the sushi bar because we decided we wanted to insert ourselves more in the ambiance. Our server's name was Frank and he was so personable and took great care of us! We started with the tuna poke bowl, which was fantastic, then had an assortment of rolls and nigiri, which was also wonderful. It was all very fresh and delicious. From the hostess, to the sushi chefs, everything was really wonderful! We will be back and we thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Another solid sushi spot for us in Charlotte.  I love the creativity and the variety of offerings.  I had a the low carb roll and dynamite roll specifically.  Both were well rolled and very flavorful.  They will also do brown rice rolls if you so desire.

Our server was very friendly and quick to serve which was a nice plus.  The interior of the place isn't anything to really get excited about but the seating is ample and comfortable.

I wouldn't put SG on the top of my go-to list but it's certainly top 5!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. We all tried something different (6 rolls and two Nagiri) and we truly enjoyed all of it!! Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Southpark area hands down. The  Guru roll is delish. Service was great. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Guru because I bought a deal from the Charlotte Observer. The waitress was very nice. I didn;t enjoy it very much because I couldn't use the deal for certain rolls. I thought the deal included the food except for alcohol. To me the restaurant wasn't honest about it. I know I am not the only one who experience this because a lot of people bought this deals online. The manager of this restaurant should tell customers who are using this Charlotte Observer deals that certain food item are excluded. I won't go back to this restaurant because intergrity and honesty are very important otherwise their sushi is very fresh."}
{"text":"I don't have any negative feedback about Sushi Guru. The sushi was delicious and there was a large selection of specialty rolls. My only feedback is that I felt is was too over priced. Today's restaurant landscape means that sushi is just as common as burgers. I've had sushi at other locations in the same general area and it's significantly less. For what you get it isn't worth the price. So I would say: it was good, not great but you should try it."}
{"text":"Let me update my review as these guys have clearly stepped it up since the last time we visited.  They were offering a specials menu with some very inventive, high quality, original offerings.  Let me tell you, Hawaiian Blue Fin Tuna Sashimi for $12 is pretty much the  best deal ever.  It did not disappoint, the color alone was the most beutiful piece of fish I have ever eaten.  Get this before it is gone."}
{"text":"While the food tonight was a FIVE star I cannot say the same for our waiter, Leisha. To just say slow would be an understatement. The fastest thing she was able to do was bring the check after we were done dinning. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone, however I wouldn't go back and sit in Leisha's section."}
{"text":"Love! Some places can't do my crunchy salmon avocado roll properly but this place does it perfect! Price is pretty typical of a sushi place. I usually get it to go because I live very close. Quick and easy to pick up."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing here.  The service needs a little help.  Been there a few times recently and have never been attended to upon walking in.  Someone either makes us wait at the front (not sure why) or tell us to seat ourselves-- which is fine.  But then there is always a wait for menus.  If it is really that hard to deliver menus to a table when people enter, maybe just put menus on every table.  It's such a simple thing but when you are ducking in for a quick lunch and 5 minutes are wasted before water or a menu is delivered, it's terrible.  Once attended to the service is good and the food comes out fast.  And again, the food is great."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, 2 of us out of maybe a dozen diners. A slow day. We both had the Guru bento box. The Guru roll is great and we both enjoyed them. This bento box gives you 4 pieces of their signature roll. We both ask for a substitution on the fruit (she asked for soup and I asked for a small amount of seaweed salad) and she asked for just tuna sashimi instead of the piece  of salmon and white fish that comes with the dish. Ryan told us there would be an up charge for the changes which we agreed. Before describing the up charge, let me first tell you the food was very good. Not great except the guru roll, but very good. Now for my ax to grind. The up charge was $5 for $12.50 meals. The charge didn't result in bankruptcy but it's the principle that the changes weren't that significant and the place was lucky to have a hand full of customers for a rainy Saturday lunch. Face it, you got to make a decision what to charge based on the charge, they did and I doubt we'll go back. There are too many other options for good sushi and there was no need to stick it to the few customers you got. By the way, I didn't think it was Ryan's call on the up charge, so his tip didn't suffer, albeit on the lower side our usual 20%. He was enthusiastic and personable but didn't adequately represent sticking I was going to get."}
{"text":"Until another restaurant proves otherwise, the best sushi in Charlotte. The freshest and best quality sushi in the area, and I've eaten sushi at a lot of places in Charlotte.  I used to go when it was Cyros and was a little bummed when they closed. But I'm glad they came back with a new name but the same menu, especially the Hamachi Jalapeno Roll.  The Omakase is a cool way to let the sushi chef show you the freshest fish of the day.

Its kind of small so might be busy around dinner time, but there are normally seats open at the sushi bar. Like most sushi places the check can escalate quickly, but Sushi Guru is worth every penny."}
{"text":"So we just moved to Charlotte and have been to several places. This was by far the best place I've had sushi. It wasn't the service (which was excellent) nor was it the sake, (which was also fantastic). But the fish was amazing (which they ship In from Hawaii. Plus Real wasabi (if you ask for it)!!! Laura, our waitress, was very knowledgable. She recommended exactly what we were looking for. Seriously a must try."}
{"text":"I'm going to admit it... The only reason I came here was the Living Social deal I scored last week. Who am I kidding? The only reason I even know this place exists is because of Living Social. And, I'm here to tell you that is a damn shame! Where has Sushi Guru been hiding my whole life? Oh, that's right... Inside the weird shopping mall/foyer/breezeway thingy behind Roosters. I mean, seriously. Could they find a more random location? 

Anyhow, I am SO excited to have discovered this sushi gem. (Thanks, Living Social!) We had the avocado tuna salad to start. Presented in a fun martini glass, the tuna was super fresh and plentiful. The sesame ginger dressing it was all tossed in was very tasty. I'd buy bottles of the stuff to take home if they'd sell it to me. After that, we shared the Bonsai and Guru roll. Both were delicious and beautifully presented but the Guru was the clear favorite. When we go back -- oh, we will be back and often at that -- I think the Guru will be the stand-by order and the 2nd roll will rotate until we can try them all and discover another favorite. 

Since this first visit, we've fallen in love with the sushi pizza! They've also started offering specials/features which are pretty amazing, too. Last week we had Haiwaiian bluefin tuna sashimi that was out of this world!! 

My only caution is that the rolls are a little on the pricey side (@$12-16 per roll for the speciality ones) for sushi. This is no Ru-Sans or Sushi 101, price-wise, but the flavor, freshness and quality are well worth the few extra dollars per roll."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Sushi Guru on opening weekend. After reading the reviews from other Yelp users complaining about the wait and service, I felt that I needed to post my own review and let Yelp users know that this restaurant has only been open for a week. Any new restaurant is like a middle school girl trying to figure out who she is... There are some logistics that Sushi Guru needs to figure out, but I would encourage the Yelp community to be patient once the restaurant is able to work through these growing pains.

Similar to other Yelp users, we had to wait 45 minutes to get a table. There were open tables available, but the reason for the wait was because of the kitchen being backed up. I think that's pretty reasonable given the popularity of the restaurant and it being their opening weekend. 

Once we were seated, my fiancé and I ordered the nigiri platter (24 count). It took another 45 minutes for our meal to arrive, which we were a little frustrated by. However, our frustration dissipated when we tasted the fish. The fish was incredibly fresh and the preparation of the fish was out of this world. It was evident that the chef put a lot of thought into our dish, and had even given us 3 extra pieces of sushi due to the wait.

We were appreciative that the kitchen and waitstaff addressed the long wait time and tried to rectify it. Some advice to management - please try to work out the logistics sooner rather than later. It doesn't matter how good your food is, but people will be hesitant to try this restaurant again unless you can run an efficient operations. 

In the meantime, I will be returning to this restaurant because of the service and food. Hopefully by that time, they will have worked through those growing pains!"}
{"text":"Went out for a bite with my family, the atmosphere was pretty cool! The food was awesome! Stuffed avocado and mango madness roll were excellent. Service was an issue. Didn't seem that busy, my tea was never brought out, waters stayed empty, and the guru roll never showed up. I mentioned this to the server, they apologized and I said just bring the check. No worries, stuff happens. After waiting another 10-15 minutes for the bill(I had to go ask for it again) and paying, I noticed we were charged for the guru roll. When I went up to the service counter I was told my guru roll was being packed to go. I advised I wanted this previously, and would not want it to go, and to remove from my bill. For a place with such good food and atmosphere, they could use a tuneup with the front of house."}
{"text":"We went to one of their \"How to make Sushi\" classes, and it was great! The Owner/Executive Chef teaches the class, so you are getting taught the real thing. Here is how our class went.
- Learned the tools needed for sushi making
- Got some edamame to share with fellow classmates
- Continued learning some basics and where to get items
- Got their signature roll to share with the table (16 pieces for 10 people)
- Learn how to make the Tuna Roll
- Make the first roll (Most if not all of the chefs are now out helping you learn)
- Get your complimentary sake (Hot sake)
- Learn how to make the California Roll
- Make the California Roll
- Teacher shows off a few tricks

All in all, the class takes about 2-2.5 hours, so be prepared for a late night. The instructions were great, and the environment was a lot of fun. You also get to take the bamboo sheet that you use to roll up the sushi. We will definitely be coming back to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wasn't a sushi fan until I tried this place.  It is delicious and the atmosphere is perfect for southpark and prices won't leave you feeling like you are overpaying for just for the location.  Big fan of this place."}
{"text":"Sometime last year we went to the sushi making class for date night and had a blast. We added this place to our list of restaurants to try but did not get around to it until I saw a coupon on LivingSocial which gave us the perfect excuse to go for dinner. 

We arrived a little after 6:00pm and we were promptly seated. We shared the shrimp spring rolls (you get three rolls) which were hot and delicious. We decided on the Guru Roll, The Queen City Roll and the Wasabi Roll. The Guru Roll was good but a little too much garlic for a sushi roll in my opinion. The Queen City Roll was absolute perfection with a beautiful presentation and delicious combination. I don't think I have tried lobster on sushi before but I am totally sold after eating this roll! The Wasabi Roll was good too but the other two rolls were eclipsed by the scrumptious Queen City. 

We decided to splurge on dessert and ordered the donut roll. This is where our experience went down a bit, over half an hour after we ordered the roll we decided we had waited long enough and cancelled our order to get the check. The waitress was very kind about it and offered to bring it out to go free of charge which was great but it took her another 15 minutes to get the check together and bring it out. We left over 45 minutes after ordering the dessert but I will say it was almost worth it when I sampled it when we got home. It has fruit inside but tastes like it was fried with donut dough and was still warm. I was very impressed with the ability to not just make sushi taste like a donut, but a yummy on at that!

I would give this restaurant a 4.5 if I could but I am always impressed when a restaurant holds itself to a high standard. We had asked to cancel the order but since it had been such a long wait the waitress took it off of the bill and I believe pushed it through to make sure we were able to bring it home and try it. I am glad she did so I will round up to a 5. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A very solid spot to stop for sushi! (bet you can't say that three times fast).

We went with the Guru roll and split the lunch special (tuna avocado roll California roll). We enjoyed all three but I have to say their Cali roll stood out! It was super fresh and probably one of the best I've had. Their rice was a bit softer than your average sushi rice (making it difficult to pick-up) but the taste was fabulous. 

The Guru roll tasted very familiar ...that's because it's the same thing as the Press roll (turns out they supply the sushi there too). I would bet that their crunchy roll and their fujisan  roll is the same  too (and perhaps others). I like these rolls but I wish they were a bit more creative and came up with something new and unique to this location. They also forgot our salad but were super friendly so I can't fault them too much on the service side. Next time i'd forgo the salad as it was iceberg bag mix...not a favorite of mine. 

My total came to $13 for my half ...very reasonable for a filling fresh- sushi lunch. I will absolutely come back and try some of their other special rolls...hopefully ones I haven't tried already at Press."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. They have very good specials on the weekends and have an expanded beer menu. Plenty of Saki to choose from too! 
When we think of sushi this is the first place that comes to mind. It's always creative and fresh. Especially love the hamachi, izumi dai, and yazzy snazzy rolls."}
{"text":"Strike One... 2 Stars.

I'm a firm believer in second chances so this won't be my only visit nor my only review.  We started with the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna.  We are huge tuna fans and love that cut of fish for a start in locations like Sullivan's (Ahi Seared Tuna) and we always start with Spicy Tuna nigiri when we eat at Room 112.  This however went horribly wrong.  I'm not sure if something was rancid, but their was the oddest taste to this app.  Pineapple was your basic thin peices that felt canned.  It was a good amount of tuna and appeared to be a great cut but the marinade made it to where we just couldn't enjoy it and only ate about 10% of it.  It was also not prepared in a way that you could enjoy multiple ingredients in one bite.

We then had the SouthPark Roll (was a special) and the Guru Roll (their signature roll).  The SouthPark Roll was advertised as having a majo drizzle of some sort, which it certainly did.  Problem was it was strong and totally overtook any other flavors.  It was a more pungent mayo than others and made the roll impossible to enjoy.  The Guru Roll was lastly a huge disappointment because it's their signature specialty roll coming in at $13.  For that pricetag I should have gone with a nigiri of some sort or a sashimi.  This was advertised as tuna, lump crab, avocado with a spicy aioli, flashed fried with fried garlic and shallots. (Will say that $1 went to a charitable cause which I liked so that was cool).  The main thing about this roll was that it was extremely basic and was overpowered by the fried shallots/garlic which in my opinion didn't belong on the roll.  I can appreciate modern interpretations and creativity with sushi, but this just didn't work.  It was like having the canned fried onion pieces, only greasier.  While many of the ingredients of both rolls were classic of the sushi most people know, the creativity actually hurt them.

When we return, we will try new rolls and a different app.  I'm truly hoping it was just a bad night.  Otherwise, I don't think this restaurant will last more than 24 months.  With Cowfish being very successful and .5 miles away, also with it set directly beside Rooster's...  and it being a pricier district.. the quality just didn't line up."}
{"text":"Food and service were both good! Great option when you're in the Southpark area. Had to try the guru roll and it did not disappoint. The pork dumplings we started with were my favorite part of the meal. Perfectly fried! My only complaint is that the sushi was a little warm and I prefer cold sushi. Competitively priced with many of the other sushi restaurants in Charlotte. Definitely want to go back and try some of the other rolls- they had so many that looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Definitely one of the stranger names I've heard. Usually \"guru\" is associated with technical prowess - and rolling sushi is more of an art form than technical, but who am I to judge?

The inside of the place is nice enough, and service is friendly, but not quick in any way, even when no one else is there. And when I say no one, I mean no one. I mean perhaps even a sushi chef, because a simple roll took forever to come out.

Once it did arrive, it was good enough, but I don't know if it was worth waiting as long as we did. I have no problem waiting (within reason) for something worthwhile, but this was just a little insane."}
{"text":"Finally made it out for sushi in Charlotte. We chose this place based on all the good reviews, I would say it was decent. It's in a funny mall with seating inside and outside. We had 3 rolls, all not too big to eat, generous and fresh. The search for the best sushi continues!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday evening with a big group (aka my family, 7 people) and it wasn't crowded at all. The server was enthusiastic and to make things easier we just got the All Star Combo where we got to choose 4 specialty rolls and chef's choice: 16 pcs of nigiri and 9 pcs of sashimi. We had one person allergic to shellfish, so we were able to sway the chef's choices and we weren't disappointed. The only critical thing for me was the red snapper nigiri was chewy, but red snapper isn't my favorite choice anyways. We got to try the best of the basics - salmon, tuna, escolar.

We enjoyed the meal and the specialty rolls were pretty good, but not something you can't get anywhere else.  Good place for moderate priced sushi and good service!"}
{"text":"Sushi Guru is pretty solid hideout restaurant for top-notch sushi. 

From the outside, you feel like you're walking into a deliberately cheesy shopping plaza / strip mall. Then, you open the door and you enter a classy gothic village, reinforced by the exquisite flooring, furniture, and fountain (the 3 F's of success).

There are creative rolls here, which I went for since the regular rolls / hand rolls were pretty pricey. I went with and would STRONGLY recommend the Signature Combo; this consists of the famous 'Guru Roll' and 6 pieces of nigiri: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white fish, eel, and shrimp. The fish was generous on the nigiri; unfortunately so much on the Guru Roll.

Granted the fish was very fresh and delicious, I will say that the rolls (Guru roll + Salmon Lover's) were a bit disappointing in terms of quantity. However, the service is fantastic, and adhered to my friend's request for spicy mayo as well as my request for fresh jalapeno slices (I'm Indian, can't help it). The freshness of the fish and the quality of service makes this place a solid 4-stars. I would recommend going here, but get ready to seriously spend for a filling meal!"}
{"text":"Their sushi pizza is amazing!! They had great service. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I had the sushi pizza along with the guru and salmon lover roll.  Everything was quite good. My friend and I could not have a another bite. Very fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish. In in a toss up between here and rusans right now. Amazing flavor on all of my rolls. Decent price 14 dollars for 2 rolls. Will have to give it a few more tries but after just one try I'm hooked. Could take the cake for favorite sushi spot in town"}
{"text":"Sushi was average at best. Poor service. Hoping they will straighten out the issues at the restaurant.  It's a shame because of the great location. Try Baku or Cowfish."}
{"text":"My sushi hidden gem.  Great ambiance.  Modern look and good consistent service.  The rolls are creative and delicious.  I like that the menu is not the run of the mill type that you find at most resturants.  Who knew apples in a sushi roll could be super delicious.  Great for dates or girls nights because it is medium sized so you can actually talk and hear each other.  Unlike somewhere like Rusans (fave for a different reason) where it can get pretty loud."}
{"text":"The place is pretty empty the sushi is just ok. I like my sushi traditional and good  and not lots of thinks on"}
{"text":"Basic sushi spot, nice setup for decor,  but nothing special. There are too many sushi spots in Charlotte. I went here on a business lunch meeting , I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a fan... I've only ate their once and that was enough. We stopped in to Sushi Guru to snag some dinner before the fireworks around the 4th. The place is small and lacked any type of ambiance but if the food is good, that can be overlooked at a place. Our server was attentive and spot on, which was really the only reason to award 2 stars.

The rolls are your typically prices, with a cheaper side of the menu and a pricier side with $ 12 -18 rolls. The drinks however were quite pricy and they were not doing any specials. I opted not to spend $5 on a beer and instead just got two rolls. The sushi wasn't bad but nothing special... here's where the 'I'll never go there again' claim comes in. We watched the fireworks, grabbed a few drinks and went home. I ended up getting physically sick that night and my guy asked how much I drank... seeing how I had two beers before we retired, I knew it had nothing to do with alcohol. And I would have brushed it off if it wasn't for my guy getting sick later on in the night. And my calling my friend Krysten and her telling me, yep I threw up as well... all 3 of us had the shrimp tempura roll so it was easy to ID the culprit. I know this doesn't happen to everyone but I wasn't impressed with the place beforehand anyway and the food poisoning of course sealed the deal."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in the Charlotte area. The atmosphere is small and quaint, but the food is always extremely fresh and delicious (and they can sub brown rice which some places cannot)! No drink specials which is a bummer, but the sushi beats any other nearby (Yama, Cowfish, Sushi 101, Pisces, Room 112, Nikko, etc.)"}
{"text":"This USED TO BE my favorite sushi/Sashimi place UNTIL I went there and ordered my usual sashimi fix and decided to add Toro to my plate. I ordered my favorites: Hamachi, Spanish Mackerel, Salmon, Maguro, Uni, Scallop, and a Sushi Guro roll. The waiter returned and informed me that they were out of Uni, so I added Toro to the mix. When my plate arrived, as usual, I went straight for a piece of Hamachi. It was perfectly fresh. Next, I directed my chopsticks for a piece of Toro and realized it was very pale in color (something I've never seen in the 28 years that I have been enjoying Sushi and Sashimi). I popped the piece in my mouth and tasted something else. No, it wasn't a beautifully marbled piece of Maguro. It was more like another piece of Yellowtail (Hamachi). It didn't seem right so I placed a piece of Hamachi and a piece of the so called Toro that was served to me side by side, and low and behold, they were identical, but sliced in a different way so as the color pattern on the fish were not in the same places. When the server stopped by our table to check in to see how our food was, I informed him about (what I thought was a mix up), showed him the two \"different\" pieces of fish, he agreed with me and apologized for the sushi chef's mistake. I said I was disappointed, that it was ok, but that I wasn't going to pay the price for Toro when it actually was Hamachi. The server said he completely understood. Moments later, the lead sushi chef/co-owner, Cy, came over to our table in a huff and questioned what the problem was. I explained the issue and showed him the fish comparison. He VERY RUDELY said what he served to me was indeed Toro but Hamachi Toro. I stood my ground (in a nice way) and refused to accept his BS. Please, if there was such a thing, I would have had it before. I moved to Charlotte from the NYC Metropolitan area less than 2 years ago. I've had sashimi at some of the best Japanese Sushi/Sashimi establishments in the US and have NEVER been offered Hamachi Toro, nor have I ever seen it available on any menu before. I even went as far as googling Toro and read nothing about Hamachi, everything revolved around Magoru when it came to Toro. After Cy stomped away from our table in a bigger huff, the lovely wait person came by and actually apologized for the way our party was treated by one of the owners. We finished our plates and our drinks, paid the bill ($150+ for 2 people, each having 1 Saporo, without Toro and without tip), left a generous tip, and walked out of Sushi Guru for the last time."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  This place is so good.  I've never been disappointed.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised.  The sushi is creative and fresh. The service is attentive and wonderful.  I have liked everything I have tried here. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Good sushi, glad to have something on another level from Akahana in town! Very cool layout and fun sushi bar where you can actually see them Mekong the sushi, unlike most where you're on the other side of the glass. Also have a poke bar! Loved the salmon tartare the best my first time out (it's sitting in a bed of avocado - kind of hard to see in the pic). Tried the takoyaki and loved them (although the taste of bonito fish flakes is not for everyone, I warn you)! Will update with more pics once I visit again - can't wait to have a Poke Bowl. Threw a few pics in of my friend's Signature Chef's Choice Sashimi. I didn't go 5 stars because for me that's reserved for places like New Zealand Cafe and Yamazaru (mostly due to quality of fish). Staff was super accommodating of gluten free for my roommate, as well! 5 stars on that!"}
{"text":"pretty disappointed, opened down the street from us we were excited about it. way overpriced for what it is, and they didn't seem to be running the place very well. and showing gory fish slaying videos while eating raw fish"}
{"text":"Food was okay. It wasn't the best for the steep price. The drinks were pretty good though. The servers aren't very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. We asked one of the servers if this was the tonkatsu ramen he literally said \" i don't know, I guess because it looks the same to the other one\".. like what?? Then i asked whats the difference between the two charashi bowl, my server had no idea. We ordered a bowl of rice, it took 15 mins to come out. I wouldn't recommend this place for food. The drinks are good so it's definitely worth a try for that. If you want a good charashi bowl, yamazaru is where I would recommend. It's cheaper and the quality is better."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon for this little spot but had heard great things. As a single mom- I have felt like the mom with kids service is subpar and this sums up my experience here. After seating ourselves as the hurried server requested, we were left for awhile before getting our drink order- the place seemed understaffed as I waited for my unsweet tea for 10 minutes. In another situation we would have left but I had a Groupon to use people! (I never do learn about groupons... there is a reason they are out there)...
I'd love to say the sushi outshines the shabby service throughout the night, but we were disappointed. The best part of the dinner was the seaweed salad and I felt similar sushi has been consumed from the friendly Harris Teeter sushi chefs. Overall our experience was \"meh\" and I will seriously rethink my future Groupon purchases."}
{"text":"meh. i didnt really care for the sushi or the price."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual dinning experience, delicious sushi and friendly service - Sushi Guru is your place.
I've been here a few times, and it's always been a good experience. So far, everything I have tried off their menu has been great! My favorites include the Sashimi Pizza, Hamachi Hottt and quite a few of their specialty rolls. I also like their miso soup because it's not overly salty. The last time I was in, I was pregnant and couldn't eat any raw fish - they offered to make any roll of my choice with the fish fully cooked. I got the Salmon Lover Roll and loved it with the cooked salmon! I'm not the biggest fan of the sake cocktails, though I did enjoy drinking some of the flavored sakes they offer. The restaurant is relatively small and the first time I ate here was with a group of 5 on a Friday night. We had a little bit of a wait; but the food, the cozy ambiance and good service made it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"hands down best sushi in charlotte. the fish is very fresh, the chef is great, the sake selection is top notch, atmosphere is pretty good, i had a great time dining here and this is now my go to spot (finally) for decent (what yall would call off the chain) sushi. thank god"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night because we didn't want to deal with the crowds at other more popular places. This place is a hidden gem! I actually think this is my new favorite sushi place in Charlotte. I ordered 2 rolls that were plenty to fill me up. The tempura roll and the salmon lover roll. Both were delicious! My boyfriend ordered chirashidon bowl and it was huge! For this who don't know, like I didn't, it's a bowl of rice with slices of sashimi on top of it. He said it was really good and it definitely filled him up."}
{"text":"Simple. Common. Pricey. Standard. 

I've lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years now and my husband and I eat sushi at least once a week... We're pretty spoiled, we know that, but we love sushi. Some how we missed noticing that sushi guru was located right in South Park. The location is kind of tucked away. 

We ordered seaweed salad and veggie dumplings to start and they were pretty standard starters. The seaweed salad didn't have that amazing lasting taste or tartness that most do, and the dumplings seemed fried on one side and were slightly burned, not steamed at all. 

We got tree hugger rolls which were the only vegan rolls on the menu and substituted tofu in another roll we split. Substituting wasn't easy and there was an up charge... Not cool if I'm substituting tofu in for fish because fish is more expensive than tofu. 

I'm not sure I would go back, but the food wasn't bad so if we needed some quick sushi I might order Postmates. The restaurant service/experience wasn't amazing or anything to rave about."}
{"text":"Growing pains. Which isn't hard to understand. It's anew place. Yellowtail sesame Salad was on point! Wait was worth it!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi bar ever.   Small little tiny bowl of seaweed salad for $6.    Hamachi jalapeño was horrendous.  Very thin little slices of yellowtail rolled up and topped with an awful ginger dressing. Not the hamachi jalapeño with traditional ponzu.    As I am writing this my sashimi just showed up and it looks like it has potential to be decent.   Nope.  Looks are deceiving the tuna is cut way to big, is mushy and has no taste.  The salmon has bad texture and tastes like it was previously frozen.    How do places get away with being so bad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I think the sushi is reasonable.  Not great, but it's a reasonably ok option if you are craving sushi."}
{"text":"I've dined here three times.  All three times the food is GREAT! The only downfall to this place is their service. There check-in desk is outside and if they're understaffed you can bet that you'll be standing there for 5-10 mins before someone notices that someone is standing out side their door.  After they finally seat you it takes another 10 mins just to get a water or drink.  After they deliver your drinks they don't ask if you'd like a starter they just ask/tell you that you're ready to order.   After the order is placed you don't see your server again until the food is delivered (hope you've had enough to drink)  After they cleared our plates it took another 10 mins to get our bill. 

Again, food is great but service is not. All three experiences at this restaurant have been the same."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews, maybe I went on a bad day. After arriving, I waited as the door, as the sign says \"Wait to be seated\". After a few minutes I peaked inside, no hostess but the sushi chefs said sit anywhere. After a few minutes, I was brought the menu, which offers a lot. I decided to try the Guru Bento Box, get a taste of a few different things. In addition, I ordered the miso soup, with had no flavor, very bland warm water, not worth it. The guru roll was god, but very heavy with the fried shallots on top, and the other items, sashimi, tempura shrimp, salad was ok. Overall I thought it was ok, nit bad, but not a 5 star sushi choice in my mind."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, especially since we sat at the sushi bar. Though it was a bit hard to see the rolls being prepared because of the glass design. We would absolutely return.

One downside: Sodas are canned so refills aren't free."}
{"text":"Sushi Guru has great food but on the night I went, 03/19, my service was horrendous. My server, Wilson had no attention to detail. I ordered my appetizers of miso soup and edamame. I asked him to please place the order of the pork and mushroom dumplings in as a dinner (I do not eat seafood). He told me he would and the next thing I know... I get everything all at once. Meanwhile, my friend ordered a salad to start with and it never came out. After waiting some time we reached out to our waiter (who was chatting with the hostess for a long time). After getting his attention we asked him about my friend's salad. He looked us straight in the face and said no, when it is ready he'd bring it out. He didn't even bother to check. It's a salad. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out. We waited a very long time for her salad. Meanwhile, I'm done with my soup, edamame and dumplings. 

I just can't wrap my head around the expense of this place with such an inexperienced server. He didn't know what we were drinking and food was not coming out at the right times. We had creme brûlée for dessert and their was barely any sugar. No cracking of sugar in my spoon!  I don't know... I was left feeling extremely disappointed. I only gave the place a 2 star rating because the food was genuinely good and my friend loves the place. If I didn't know it was good for her, I'd give them a 1. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Yumm Yumm Yumm - delicious sushi!!

At first you think its just in a shopping center outlet, but then you walk in and the atmosphere is quite sophisticated. Even inside they have some artworks and paintings on the wall, that you could even buy - like an art gallery. 


Best Tip about this place: They don't offer non-alcholic beer and some other drink options, however you are allowed to go across the way to the other restaurant (Rooster's) and bring back any drinks that Sushi Guru does not offer - pretty sweet and accommodating of them!!"}
{"text":"There is good sushi, and there is sushi guru. Fresh fish, warm sushi rice, creative inventions - this is hands down the best sushi joint in the Carolina's. You won't get burgushi here, but you will get some damn fine sushi and sashimi. Try the ceviche!!'"}
{"text":"Well, wasn't going to drive this far since I was by the airport but took a chance. Great ambiance, wait staff, and the food is pretty great. Sit at the bar and get extra goodies. It's nice to be in a Japanese restaurant and the chef is Japanese."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying the food is always delicious, but i have had the worst service I have had in Charlotte a few times in a row. I kept hoping it was a fluke but it doesn't get better. We waited almost 1.5 hours for three rolls. No food was coming out to any table and every table was complaining to their waiter. Even after speaking with the manager they weren't going to comp items on the bill until I complained again. The food is good- but not worth the bad service. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, yummy sushi. I asked the waitress for the best tuna sushi and she hesitated for one second then a huge smile crept up on her face. She said it would be a surprise and that if I didn't like it I could choose another roll. Let me tell you people, this was one of the best tuna rolls I've ever had and mind you I am a sushi snob. The surprise tuna roll wasn't on the menu either! So I felt so special!! It was called the super tuna crunchy roll. The sushi was a bit expensive but i don't mind paying for quality food. I also got the guru roll and salmon crunchy roll, which was Ah-mazing!"}
