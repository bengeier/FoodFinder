{"text":"Definitely one of the best Food Trucks around!!   So different/refreshing!  I tried their \"signature sandwich\" with chicken (or beef) with moz cheese and spicy veggies on a hoagie roll.   I had a good feeling since the presentation alone made my mouth water.   The sandwich did not disappoint and was so in the zone .. while eating.  It was delicious.   I am a sandwich lover and love a good spin - other than just lettuce and tomato.   There are a variety of mayo options too- which I love.  I went with the spicy horseradish.. which made the sandwich epic.   I couldn't pass up the \"Spuds Australian style potato cakes\" - comes with cheaddar cheese & sour cream dipping sauce (that I could have ate with a spoon!!  The potato buds were so interesting -different...  harty and fun to dip.   No doubt delicious.    Thanks Rolling Kitchen.. look forward to our next encounter!"}
{"text":"Really good but a little pricey.    I hate the portabella mushroom philly sandwich with the horseradish mayo.  Big sandwich on really tasty toasted bread. I couldn't finish it for lunch and probably won't have dinner now.   I was talked into the spuds - totally worth it!  I don't know how to describe them, but they are amazing.  Again - a side for $3.50 is a lot, but when it is that tasty, it works out okay."}
{"text":"Was excited to try something new today. The two guys running this truck are super nice. I wasn't sure what to get and they helped me out with suggestions. I ended up with pulled beef in a bowl and spuds. Yum this pulled beef so good. I'm enjoying it's like a salad with the lettuce and mozzarella cheese on top. I don't eat mayo but they recommended their mayos."}
