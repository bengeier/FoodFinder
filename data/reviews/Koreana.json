{"text":"Monday night, lots resto were closed, and we chose this place completely by chance.   when we entered, owners of the resto welcomed us as if we belonged to their family. food was delicious, served very quick, with heartwarming smile and jokes. their \"jijimgae\" has very nice crispy texture, not like the one which is flat and chewy. all other dishes were tasty like fresh homemade.   this is the place when you look for authenticity, good kimchi and familial atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had a spicy pork and potato soup and a chicken/rice/veg platter of sorts. Amazing flavor. Plus the owner was so sweet and friendly!"}
{"text":"When one thinks of deep fried battered calamari, `Korean style` probably doesn`t even make it in the top 5. And yet, I think I`ve found my new love. Gently spiced, crisply fried with hardly any hint of greasiness... perfectly executed. The beef bulgogi was delicious too and served on a sizzling hot plate, even better. As for drinks, their `Kangria` was very refreshing and totally hit the right notes for me. I'd happily go back for those three things, and for the attentive, genuinely friendly service by the family who runs the place."}
{"text":"Had the most incourteous service ever. Food is not amazing either. The waiter is really mean. He kicked a couple out in a rude manner. The couple just accidentally sat at the table outside on the street without knowing the table belonged to the restaurant."}
