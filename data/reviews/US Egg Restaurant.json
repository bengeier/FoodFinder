{"text":"One of our favorite spots for breakfast! You have not lived until you have had the spinach florentine omlette with deep fried hash browns.  So flavorful.  Plus almost all the servers are fun and super sweet. Over all great place to dine."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes are pretty much the best reason to go here. The rest of the stuff (eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc) is just so-so."}
{"text":"Came in to two smiling faces, was sat in Heather's section and it was an experience. Nice lil restaurant, bigger than i thought but still enough of a home feeling to make me stay at least a half an hour longer than i planned on anyway! Very attentive service even though it was a slow day, im sure they pick it up even more when its busy. I recommend turning for that protein pancake mix into a waffle, i was crazy surprised."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good idea for breakfast in my South Scottsdale neighborhood, and just could not pass by the 27 good reviews of US Egg in good conscience without relaying my very different experience - one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  I usually like US Egg but had never been to this location until about 6-8 weeks ago. A friend and I were running around doing errands and decided to stop for a quick bite what turned out to be about 13 minutes before closing. We asked if they were still serving, the answer from the host was yes, of course and were shown to our table. I made a quick run to the ladies' room while my friend ordered coffee and got menus. And it was when I returned to the table that things began their nose-dive.    Evidently our waitress had dropped off the menus and told my friend that we needed to hurry and order, and actually expressed annoyance that I was in the ladies room. Hmm. At this point I gave US Egg the benefit of the doubt. People don't actually say things like that! But when the waitress came to take our order, she was clearly annoyed. So much so, I asked if it was too late to get a meal, told her we'd asked at the door when we arrived. She said we'd have to hurry but they were still open. I chalked it up to her being tired at the end of her work day. We ordered immediately, and breakfast arrived quickly.   The food was a disaster: coffee was cold, the eggs were not cooked, the veggies were not edible, the hollandaise was out of a can or other container and had been microwaved or something, still retaining the shape of the container (read not warmed enough). Just thinking about it now, makes me shudder. Honestly, I could not eat it. I tried. We were hungry. While we \"ate\" someone came over to our area and mopped the floor with some very strong smelling cleaning solution. OMG. There was no one else sitting around us. We did not get coffee refills. The waitress left the building. And we had to flag someone else down who was clearly annoyed to have to bring coffee and the bill. She saw that we had not eaten and offered a container, but we declined. A good opportunity to point out the raw broccoli and jellied hollandaise and said we did not want to take it with us, it was not a good meal at all, and we'd wished that they had simply told us no, they could not serve us at the door. She shrugged.    The host/manager sat at a table near the door reading one of the free newspapers from the rack near the door, appearing to be killing time, waiting to close, unaware of what was happening. We did not complain. The problem was with multiple personnel, including him. No one - host, two waitresses, cook(s) and floor clean-up guy took any pride in their work or showed any sign of \"welcoming\" us into their establishment. Instead of being so rude and wasting our time and thiers, they should have politely asked us to come back another time when we came in the door. That would have been fine.    We could not wait to get out of there. I left a minimal tip (I was not going to let them decide my response to their bad behavior). I paused at the door looking back at our table. I was amazed to see that there were at least 3 other tables of people eating, so we were certainly not the last lingering guests. The manager never even looked up from his reading and we walked right by him. On the way to the car I swore to myself that I'd find and write a letter to the *owner* but never did. More wasted time. We were just never going back. Ugh. This was one of the most \"inhospitable\" hospitality experiences I've ever had. I fully expected the restaurant to be closed by now. And instead, I see positive reviews? Bewildering."}
{"text":"My son (9) and I came based off some reviews and we are both glad we did. It is a family run business and the owner George even came by to see how everything was. My son had the kids protein pancakes and I had the half and half, protein pancakes with an Idaho veggie skillet.  My son is an extremely picky eater but after he ate he said \" well this is the best breakfast place around, I have benidicted\" ( funny kid like eggs Benedict lol ) This will be our new breakfast brunch lunch spot. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes the best ever here.  Huge menu as well, the arizona frittata is another fav"}
{"text":"I would highly Recommend it if you love good breakfast food! Quick service friendly smiles!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and gross food. We walked in and the manager barely greeted is. He was to busy talking to some server half his age. The waitresses are young and to busy with gossip to serve you. The food for the price is ridiculous.  I did try to like the food here."}
{"text":"Perfect. The Kansas City is all eggs bacon and sausage. It will fill u up. Service is great and fast. Very clean with smiling waitstaff. Easy parking."}
{"text":"I love this place. Both Tempe & Scottsdale locations. We are always greeted warmly, seated promptly, and the wait staff is perfect. I love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee. I also love that they dont freak out when I want two bacon strips & two sausage links."}
{"text":"I was super excited they put in a US Egg in North Scottsdale until I experienced the awful customer service and management.   We saw our server once, who never checked to see if we got our food.  45 minutes after we ordered we finally asked for a manager, who was extremely rude and condescending.  From that point forward the server and manager made the situation extremely uncomfortable.  I will never come back to this place which is unfortunate because the other locations are so awesome."}
{"text":"Glad we trusted the reviews. This place was awesome, I had the meat lovers skillet and a bloody Mary, might be the best breakfast I have ever had. Highly recommended,"}
{"text":"Come here every year when I'm in Scottsdale for Spring Training. After a night of drinking and sporting a huge hangover this place saves me every time. The portions are huge  and the service is quick and friendly. Sometimes there's a long wait to get in though. It's a painful walk here from the hotel, but I leave with a skip in my step to Scottsdale Stadium"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes were a disappointment. There has got to be better places to eat breakfast in town. Made a bad choice with the huevos rancheros. Beans and chili out of a can almost certainly.   Atmosphere was very old, guess it's good for families. Service was good but overall pretty meh if you're looking for something special."}
{"text":"I have been going for years and have been to all of the locations and I only have the protein pancakes...I have gone with people that got other food and they said it was great so I am taking their word for it, but I am sticking to the PP!  I get 2 and take one home to eat for a later meal.  I wish I knew how many calories were in one but aside from that, I will be a devoted follower!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast - eggs, protein pancakes, skillets.... Great service too! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times over the years but they seem to have copped an attitude. The other day I asked for bacon crispy. To me that means the fat is cooked through but not burnt. It came out uncooked. Today i asked for hash browns crisped up. They came out like over cooked shoe string potatoes. I pictured the cook upset at the request and producing this garbage. Add some poor service to boot and I am done with this place. Crappy tooth picks as well."}
{"text":"There are good breakfasts, and then there are the type that make you wonder what the hell you've been eating up until that point.  US Egg in Scottsdale made that type of impression on me.  Walking in, one might think that it was little more than a Denny's wannabe on steroids.  The place has the look of trendy/family style cooking.  It came off a little crowded which means one of two things, the food is really good, or the place that is merely convenient and cheap.  Service was prompt.  The waitress asked for my drink order, and coffee and water were everything I needed.  She came back quickly with a pitcher of both, that she left on my table, a nice touch for those who are addicted to either...which I am.  Open only during breakfast and lunch, the menu caters mostly to that, with the breakfast menu dominated by, you guessed it, eggs.  Feeling rather adventurous, I went the chicken embryo route.  The Triple Play is basically eggs, four slices of a breakfast meat (bacon or sausage) and wheat pancakes.  I almost ordered that, but saw that you can upgrade the pancakes to protein pancakes.  My curiosity was sparked, and I read that they were pancakes with cinnamon, granola and blueberries.  It sounded good enough, so I went for the upgrade....and thank God that I did.  Once the food got there I was immediately intrigued by what lie before me.  Two eggs, four slice of bacon and two golden brown pancakes.  First I went to the eggs.  If this meal is going to be any good, and they can live up to their name, these were going to be good.  Upon first taste, I knew that the rest of the meal was going to be great.  The eggs where cooked perfectly, and were even seasoned with salt and pepper.  The bacon was honestly cooked, not over done, but not limp and undercooked.  Dare I say, it was perfect.  I ate with delight, but my eyes couldn't get off the protein pancakes.  Soon enough, I was there, fork in hand, thinking I knew what I was in for...I had no clue what my taste buds had in store for them.  The cinnamon was perfect in it's seasoning, no too much by any means.  The granola, which I was skeptical about from the very beginning, but was proven wrong for such thoughts.  They were a different flavor and texture, that helped take the pancakes to new heights, and the blueberries weren't bad either.  But these pancakes were like nothing I've ever had before, a complete orgasm for the senses.  To say that this was the best breakfast of my life would be overstating.  I would say that it was definitely in the top three of my all time breakfast meals.  I would recommend US Egg, and was definitely urge whoever goes there to get the protein pancakes, they are worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot with consistent quality food and service. The owners are always at the front and make you feel welcome. Eveything i have tried is good but i would say protein pancakes and the idaho skillet are must haves. Try the half and half to get both!"}
{"text":"1. coffee warm, not hot. 2. Both of us ordered potatoes crispy; one came regular and one well done - had to send back. 3. GLASS IN WAFFLE when i bit into it!!!!!! Credited this breakfast, not the coffee, ruined our breakfast, should have credited the $18.00.  Glass in the waffle!  At least they acknowledged that something broke in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I wanted something light when I went here with friends recently so I ordered the fruit plate. This fruit plate was GINORMOUS -- nice!  It seriously lasted me for a few days. Besides giving a thumbs up on the portions of my meal, our server was really friendly. Next time I go I'm definitely gonna go for protein pancakes."}
{"text":"Standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence, U.S. Egg's Scottsdale's location is place of redemption, both for your soul and your appetite. Open only for breakfast and lunch, the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the 'dale itself. This is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap: some locals are known to eat here daily.  Its location is slightly outside the Old Town Pale, but still within walking distance unless it's the height of summer. Secondly, it has its own parking lot, making it as accessible as Denny's or a Marie Callendars. Nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings, and you will definitely see people waiting. unless you arrive very early or late. There is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room.  Having gone numerous times alone, I am always impressed how quickly I am seated. No bias against tables for one here. The servers are all personable and graceful...yet not self-aggrandizing. This is not a Michelin four-star restaurant however, and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot. Given the volume of service, it's also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is.  The food is also excellent. Although you can order both lunch or breakfast, I tend to crave the latter more. There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples. This helps to explain why the uber-fab Scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the Cadillac set. Prices are very reasonable for Scottsdale, though perhaps too much for a dirt-poor college student or person living only on Social Security.  The building also capitalizes on Arizona's sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows...causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness. There's plenty of ambient noise as a result...but it's almost reassuring. Not to mention that the hearing-aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice.  U.S. Egg is not flawless, however. From a cost point of view, the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day. Without a dinner menu though to recoup cost, diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say  Denny's. Neverthless it's still worth it, in my opinion. The other shortcoming stems from the food. Different dishes often rely on the same sides. If you get sick of their potatoes for example, you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time. Moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies.  While it may not cure your hangover (or incontinence), U.S. Egg remains firmly on the map for locals. Managing to please all of Scottsdale is a tall order, and the owners, managers, and staff all should stand tall and be proud."}
{"text":"Oh my. Not exactly sure what to say. We went here and had breakfast but it was not good.  Betwen the 4 of us they only got 1 order right. The girls never complain - they just won't go back.  Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Food cold eggs overdone plus it is expensive for breakfast. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"In my fairly short experience I have found that my favorite pregancy food is wheat pancakes.  How did I find this out?  A friend brought me here for breakfast the other day and those plain wheat pancakes took me through the day (2 meals) and erased my nagging sickness.  Any meal that can nuke the puke is good by me so I'll definitely be back  In general the food is good (excellent bacon, just the right amount of done) and the fresh oj hit the spot.  They even accomodated my friend's young daughter and made her the strawberry pancakes in kid form so we didn't have to pay the $9 for the adult ones."}
{"text":"We took a chance on U.S. Egg as it was the closest breakfast spot to us and we were starving and hungover from the last night. We definitely hit the jackpot-U.S. Egg got us back on our feet in no time! Wait wasn't too long and the service was great. Our waitress was pretty funny and definitely knew we were super hungover-she skipped giving us glasses and just gave us a whole pitcher of water. Portions are big and food is A+. I definitely recommend the protein pancakes-they were my favorite thing I had. Also had scrambled egg whites, hashbrowns, bacon, and toast; all of it was perfect. Topped it all off with a grapefruit juice to take care of the hair of the dog and we were ready for our next Spring Training game! Will definitely return here next year."}
{"text":"They have all the basics for a great breakfast and some healthy options as well. Great for kids in strollers, family seating abounds. All while they get you in and out quickly. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast before golfing in Scottsdale. Had really great omelette with a side of fruit & rye toast.  Boyfriend loved his breakfast also. Wait staff was super friendly and brought pitchers of iced tea & diet coke so we never ran out. Quick and efficient, it was the best breakfast we had on our trip."}
{"text":"The question, of course, is: What do you order at a place named U.S. Egg? A hamburger, right? Right.  In doing so, you'll get to devour one of the best burgers to be found in downtown Scottsdale.  The second version of this two-store operation (the first is in Tempe) offers terrific breakfast and lunch grub at reasonable prices. I've had the eggs and all that. They're good, too. And, I suspect, most people come for breakfast rather than lunch. But if you're steering your car into the neighboring Red Lobster or Olive Garden, or, for goodness sake, Denny's to stuff yourself full of corporate crap, stop. Do yourself a favor and pull into the U.S. Egg. Or do other people a favor and park in the Red Lobster/Olive Garden lot and go to U.S. Egg. Perhaps the lot will, with your help, fill up and terrible eating disasters will be avoided.  Anyway, U.S. Egg has burgers, sandwiches, eggs, pancakes and all that stuff. They're open everyday until 2:30 p.m. Seating was speedy as was the friendly, helpful service during our visit. The atmosphere is mellow and the two-seat booths offer a coziness not found at other joints. It's easy to overlook this place, for whatever reason. Stick it in the back of your mind and try it out someday. I think you'll be happy you did.  * You'll find the menu, hours, addresses and other such information on the website."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict were just ok but the staff was very friendly and always refilled my drink"}
{"text":"Great breakfast but not a cheap one.  Lots of options.  They claim their 'protein pancakes' are what they are famous for...bad sales pitch in my mind.  They are average at best and if you love normal pancakes, these will stink.  Go with something else on the menu...lots of options and everything else I've had has been good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with Mike Couchie. Nice clean place good atmosphere. However my scrambled eggs were cold and over cooked. Mike easy over were over hard he complained and got two perfect eggs brought right over. I think this restaurant is just ok and I probably won't return, seems expensive for cold eggs."}
{"text":"We gave it a shot be side it was the new guy on the block. The food was OK, just warm out of the kitchen. The service was friendly but not attentive. I think we will be sticking to our old standby in the next plaza south."}
{"text":"Try the protein pancakes! So good. I was expecting them to get their name from having protein powder or meat in them, but I was excited to hear they are packed with blueberries, granola, and other tasty ingredients. The wait for a table was short, the staff was very attentive, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My brother and I are just visiting for two days on a road trip to CA and saw the reviews on yelp. It is a nice, pleasant breakfast atmosphere with kind servers and a cool wall mural. The food was great as well, and you definitely get your bang for your buck (a.k.a lots of food). The protein pancakes were excellent, just like the server suggested. Overall great place to wake up and eat in Scottsdale. Doesn't get a five star though because nothing really WOWED us, but it was good food."}
{"text":"Healthy options are many here. I got a veggie patty with no roll and a huge side of broccoli. They have gf bread and waffles, no wheat in their salad dressings or omelettes. The nicest touch came when we asked our server if there was a froyo place nearby. (We're vacationers.) She insisted on getting the manager, who gave us the names of SEVERAL yogurt shops, googled directions, and gave them to us. Really good service!"}
{"text":"Our usual \"breakfast place\" was a place called The Breakfast Joynt but sadly they have yet to relocate...and been replaced by some cheap version of the legend it followed.  The Windy City Cafe is not a place we would return to anytime soon.   But, as we are waiting for the relocation of the BJ!!!!....we decided to try US Egg.... **DRUMROLL** This place did not disappoint when it came to my steak& eggs with pancakes.. The service is friendly (even when slammed), the food is delicious, and it is the perfect place to go any day of the week but especially for Sunday breakfast.     Delicious"}
{"text":"Santa Fe skillet was really good!  The other person I was with had the Protein Pancake with blueberries and said it was really good too"}
{"text":"I got the breakfast plate that contained the most meat. I didn't even finish half of it. Very humbling experience. Over all the food was better than average but I'm more impressed with the quantity"}
{"text":"Went their for a team-building breakfast the other day. It's been a little while since I set foot in here.   As far as a breakfast/brunchery place, it'll probably hit the spot for most people. They have decent portions, decent prices and a vast selection of menu items.   There is just a few things I would like to see homemade. Their corn beef hash is straight out of a can, their country gravy is straight out of a bag. If I remember correctly it's mixed with 3 qts. cold water, then added to 1 qt boiling water, and SHAZAAM! you have instant country gravy (I'd like to thank my first cooking job at Flying J for leaving that bit of knowledge in my head. )  Any way, the service is pretty good. We were there on a weekday, so business wasn't that bad. But I remember coming here on a Saturday years ago and the poor staff just got pummeled.   So I give this place an average rating with food that will please most. They seem to be in business for quantity over quality."}
{"text":"Food was very good with nice size portions.  Wait staff did a great job and owner walked the floor checking and keeping things in order."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! They even leave water and a coffee pot at your table. They had new hash brown potatoes today. The old one were like fried chips. The new ones are 100% better love them. As for the protein pancake a must try it's great."}
{"text":"My partner and I were in the area and I used YELP to help me find a Great breakfast place, or at least that's what I thought.  This place was mediocre at best.  I'm not a food snob by any means, but I just do not think this place deserves 4 stars. I've had fantastic breakfasts in cheaper places.  These Yelp ratings are a little disappointing, as it seems like almost every place has 4 stars, unfortunately we all know not all restaurants are fantastic.  Anyway, we both wished we'd gone to Denny's instead."}
{"text":"We went on Father's Day so the place was really busy but that does not justify the mediocre service and do not order strawberry waffles unless your like strawberry glaze from a can because that is what it is! Ugh! Also be careful with the build your own omelette as it was over $18!!  Granted we ordered egg whites and about 5 other items but geez, shouldn't the initial price include some items other than just the eggs?? We asked for a side of salsa and they server told us they have two types. We decided to try both. We got the bill and we were billed $0.75 for each!!  Our bad as we need to read the menu better as we were nickel and dime to death!! Thanks Brittany."}
{"text":"The Restaurant manager is rude. My husband and his brother walked into the restaurant first. They were completely ignored. The manager was standing at the podium and looked right at them then just looked away. He only acknowledged me once I walked in.   When we received our food it was luck warm, not cooked all the way. We sent the food back to be cooked more, nothing like see-through, pink, greasy bacon! Yum! When the food returned, it was not much better. The table did not have any condiments, our waitress was nowhere to be found and I had to get them from another table. At no time did we receive an apolgy or visit from the manager for being unhappy with the food.   When we received our bill, I was quite surprised that we were charged $8 for coffee.   Upon leaving the restaurant, my husband and his brother were ignored again. The manager only said thank you to me.   Last time we will be dining there, which is unforunate because we were regular customers."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was one of the best I have had.  Great atmosphere, service, and food!  It will be a must stop for us in Scottsdale.  The protein pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Horrible Service! From the time we sat down to paying the check...  How do you mess up a BLT & Fries? I'll tell you how \"COLD AND FLAVORLESS\"!  Cold coffee and floats in the water!  My husbands omelet and hash browns were Luke warm and had NO FLAVOR!   Absolutely worst breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here every other Sunday the past several years and I always have a great experience! Today unfortunately I had the worst server, Vanessa. She was very pushy and impatient. She checked in on us twice and never brought us the refills we asked for. Great food, so-so service."}
{"text":"Stopped by U.S. Egg this morning and had breakfast. It was fantastic!  Our server Chelsea was exceptional. I had the ham and sausage skillet and my wife (it was her birthday) had the protein waffles and half skillet. They were both delicious. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I've been a couple times now, and is always good. Very busy though. So expect a wait, but definitely a great place to go for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I've never had something that I didn't love here. I really love the protein pancakes. It's not often that I order the same thing more than once because I like to try new things, but I can't get enough of the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. I really like the low carb menu. Friendly staff. Get there early as there can usually be a long line because of the great food."}
{"text":"The US Egg is awesome! I love their protein pancakes and their staff is very friendly. I've tried a few other things at this restaurant; however, if you've never been here before, the protein pancakes are a must!  Once when I was there my food came out wrong. I told the waitress that it was fine, and I would eat it. The manager/owner came over and apologized and comped my entire meal. I thought it was really great how they take care of their customers. I would recommend this place if you've never been there."}
{"text":"You're sure to see the hungover Scottsdale crowd that you ran into the night before at US Egg on most weekend days. The restaurant is usually PACKED from 9 a.m. to Noon, but the food is worth the wait. I love the Chalet French Toast and Protein Pancakes. The staff is friendly. And since they give you small glasses filled with soft drinks, they'll usually give you a pitcher so you can refill your own drinks. The Egg, as I like to call it, is also a celebrity hot spot. Barry Bonds, Ice Cube and his wife Coco and Joe Rogan have all stopped in for breakfast at this yummy eatery."}
{"text":"My co-workers always talk about this place so I figured to give it a try with a group of friends. I ordered the 1/2 meat lovers skillet with blueberry protein pancakes....it was BOMB! The sweetness of cinnamon and blueberries just went so together with the syrup. The skillet itself was phenomenal. My girlfriend loved her eggs Benedict. I think I just found my Sunday breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Just like Denny's and ihope. Breakfast fast-food"}
{"text":"Looked for a breakfast place and found this establishment close by. We were seated right away and the waitress quickly stopped by to accommodate our drinks.  Ordered the garden (veggie) omelet and a turkey sandwich, both came out very fast although neither of them were all too special. Sandwich came out dry  barely having any mayo and the omelet was meh.  All and all quick service,  decent prices and food is ok."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good. They don't take reservations, but we called ahead for our group of 8 and they set aside a table for us. Thanks guys!  I know it's a chain,but it really didn't feel like it. The service was great, food delicious, and price was spot on. It did have a BIT of an iHoppy feel to it with the carafe of coffee for the table, but I have only good things to say :)"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food. I ordered the Bay Area French Toast, it came covered in strawberries and bananas. The taste was as good as its presentation. Brianna served and she was super friendly.  When ordering a coffee (drip coffee) or iced tea they serve it in a canister/pitcher so you never run low. Everything was very clean and the ambiance is nice with neat artwork scattered on the walls. 10/10."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was clean and bright, which I appreciate for a breakfast joint. I would say the food...well, it fell short. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, bacon, and fruit plate.   The pancakes were tasty but a little bland, even with syrup. The fruit plate looked a little old and the bacon was dry, perhaps baked instead of fried. Also, the food wasn't that hot, which was sort of gross.   Overall, I'd give it another shot and pick something else, but if it's still disappointing, I'd move on."}
{"text":"Glad to see the new location up north...always a consistent solid place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast food...expecially the skillets. Consistent style and portions...I really like the chicken, bacon, avocado skillet. However, I'm not a big fan of the coffee...i think it's quite bitter. but they have fresh squezzed O.J....and great whole grain pancakes."}
{"text":"Love this place- consistently good and friendly. Portions may even be too large. Come here for breakfast when visiting AZ twice a year and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch type meal to start my day and recommend getting the half & half.  You can't go wrong.  Sizeable portions.  On weekends, it gets super busy so I go during the week.  Also ordered take-out and was finished on time."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I will come again not because of the food but because the waitresses are pretty and sexy and I hope one becomes my friend one day then my girlfriend and hopefully a wife in the near future."}
{"text":"So I guess they removed my last review.  Not sure why.  In my last review, I stated that we arrived just after 2:20 on a Sunday afternoon.  The front desk girl told us they were not seating any body else because they close at 2:30.  If you're going post everywhere your open until 2:30 then continue to seat people until 2:30.  My impression is that they lack service.  We went to another place nearby just north of there that remained open until 3.  Unlike US Egg, they were very nice and seemed happy when we walked through the door.  If you're going to not seat people until 2:30, then you should post it on your website.  Hopefully this doesn't get taken down as well.  I felt strongly enough about this that I took the time to write a second review.  Much better options around the area."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmmm! The flavour and freshness is unbeatable... Denny's ain't got s**t on this place. The masters of Breakfast I would say. Great creations and incredible taste. Service prompt and attentive staff. The restaurant provides complimentary coffee outside while you wait, which was a nice little bonus. Protein pancakes were Delish! I actually finished my entire plate. Totally recommend doing the combo where u get a smaller skillet with pancakes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE U.S. Egg! Amazing service and food every time!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast experience ever!! Service was excellent. Thank you Samantha Bailey!! Your right the Bloody Mary's were made with love Good size portions and warm salsa made my breakfast yummy! Gluten free menu was super with waffles and good gf toast. I would recommend this for breakfast"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant,  Decent food.  Nothing special.  Nothing bad.  Veggie scramble was hot, predictable and fast-to-the-table.  WAAAY too much iced tea - asked for a glass of iced tea, lots of ice, got a pitcher.  Felt compelled to drink a lot of it, just because it was there.    Service was good, but this place is franchisey-ish and not really memorable."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday morning expecting to wait forever (like any other breakfast place on a sunday morning), but we were surprised when the owner said it was a 10 minute wait. The entire time I was thinking \"NO WAY\" since there were a lot of people ahead of us. Surprisingly we were seated in ~10 minutes. Food got to our table quick and prompt. Our waitress was wonderful and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wanted a simple bite before my hike. Protein cakes and a couple egg whites is going to set me off with fuel I need. The coffee is an excellent kicker too. Well done. Off I go!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to US Egg for about five years, and over that time the food has remained consistently great.  Their menu is large and is a good mix of the healthy and the, well, less healthy.  The protein pancakes are their signature dish, and although I'm not sure I believe the low \"net carbs\" they describe on the menu, they are still really tasty and very unique.  I've had a variety of omelettes and scrambles here and I really like them all.  But most of the time I order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese (there are a couple of options) with an egg on top.  I always have them add a second egg to get the egg-meat-cheese-potato balance just right.  It can be crowded on the weekend, especially during spring training and typical busy tourist times.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big."}
{"text":"The Going South omelette did not disappoint! 4 stars overall for their ok service and not crispy enough hash browns."}
{"text":"I once had a guy take me on a date here because he loved the food so much.  I had never been, and though the relationship with that guy didn't work out, I don't think my love for U.S. Egg's Protein Pancakes will ever fizzle.   The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but the staff is always extremely friendly and service is pretty timely.  Portions are quite large, but the menu is a tad on the expensive side for a breakfast place.  If you're going for anything other than pancakes or waffles, especially egg dishes, it can be a game of roulette with the quality, but I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably the only reasonable option for a Sat/Sun breakfast place in its area. Good food, quick service. The place is always busy, but wait times are short. They lose a star because as they became more popular, the quality of the food began to diminish in the sense that it seemed rushed. For example, I always order my hash browns extra crispy now, just so that they'll be cooked right, sometimes bacon comes out undercooked, etc. If you're in south Scottsdale and looking for a good breakfast place that won't be a hassle or a long wait, you can't go wrong with US Egg. I recommend the skillets, or the chicken-fried steak and eggs. And always get a side of bacon."}
{"text":"US Egg is my go-to breakfast joint every weekend. I have celiacs and their large menu of gluten free items is amazing. They have gluten free toast, waffles, and french toast. Plus they adjust many of their menu items for a food allergy if you just ask. Love it!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service.a bit pricey for breakfast tho..cost me 17.00 with tip..but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good restaurant but they always, always over cook the eggs.  You would think w the name us egg, they could get this right. Ask for over easy if you want anything less that hard boiled."}
{"text":"Mmmmm the U.S. Egg is absolute greatness, what Denny's could be if it only tried a lot harder.   Get the protein pancakes. Even if you don't necessarily want protein pancakes at that time, get them, take them home, put em in the fridge and then eat small pieces of them throughout the day. They're absolutely wonderful. The Border skillet is also a winner--great chorizo and salsa. Have heard the Eggs Benedict are great.   Delightful place. Obviously fills up fast on weekend mornings but have never suffered through too long of a wait. Service has always been pleasant. Prices are reasonable enough."}
{"text":"The food was excellent had the mushroom omelette & the amazing protein pancake..I was stuffed.. Good service family friendly"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. The workers are pleasant, attentive, professional, and efficient. My server took my order, which I customized considerably. She offered helpful suggestions when I told her what I wanted. The meal came out of the kitchen within a few minutes, and exactly as I requested.   One thing that impressed me above all else was that there was a carafe of coffee and a pitcher of water on the table. I was never without something to drink, both for nourishment (caffeine is a major food group) and for hydration.  Kudos to a well-run restaurant. They aren't so common.  Oh yeah, the food tasted great. My omelette plus coffee came to $17, which is a little pricey to an old guy, but it was worth every penny. Quality costs a little extra."}
{"text":"Ok so the protein pancake was good but over all the execution of the food really fell short.  The OJ was fresh squeezed but you could tell they used oranges that were turning bad, my over easy egg was cooked well past it's time so the center was like a hard boiled egg and my husbands omelette was overdone and browned on the edges.   Edible, yes, but clearly kitchen staff is just churning out the food without much thought.  I could even hear them yelling at each other for a bit while sitting at my table.  Maybe just a bad day?"}
{"text":"A great place. The service was excellent even with a large table. Protein pancakes are amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for breakfast!!! Sometimes of you go in early afternoon for breakfast, its not as good as the morning cooks (soggy french toast, overcooked eggs, almost burned ham), but overall its awesome!  Try the protein pancakes, you will be hooked!  We've gotten to know a few of the waitresses and they are all friendly (except for one blonde one who is more interested in showing her ass off to rich looking dudes than her tables).   Try it! You will not be unhappy."}
{"text":"I tried US Egg for the first time last month and have been back several times. The menu is a mix bag with some really good items (like the Protein Pancakes, Biscuits and Gravy and BLT Sandwich) and some not so good items, like any omelet covered in one of US Egg's horrible sauces.  AVOID the \"sauces\"at  ALL COSTS!   Generally, I order extra sauce, but the Hollandaise, Cajun, and \"Gentleman Jim's\" sauces are pretty gross.  The \"Cajun\" sauce is the worst.  A weirdly flavored, brown-tan mess, with bits of gum-chewy mushrooms.  Yuck.      The hosts and wait staff go out of their way to be friendly.  The bright, airy dinning room is nice, and relaxing. Order coffee or tea and get a whole pot.  I appreciate the quick service and consistency (even the sauce is consistently bad!) and they never glass (or mug) run dry, without refilling whatever you are drinking.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Went to have brunch with a friend on a rainy day. The restaurant was packed,  yet we were able to be seated in 15 minutes. We both ordered omelets. They were  delicious!  I ordered the South omelet with chorizo,  etc..my girlfriend got the veggie which was loaded with fresh veggie. Instead of the hash brown, she got a substitute of oatmeal. She got a huge bowl with sides of raisins and cinnamon. An enjoyable meal for us both. Nice size portions of everything."}
{"text":"Neat little diner.  Great signs, decent service.  Kind of a weird crowd inside but it's a breakfast place so what do you expect.  The egg dishes are great as you would expect...my son of course got the pancakes with granola (signature), which is a creative and VERY filling dish.  well priced and nice, well-lit ambience.  I wouldn't expressly go out of my way to go here but it's a cool little joint that if I lived in the area I would probably hit a few times a week."}
{"text":"I occasionally come here when I'm in town for work and although I never write reviews, I felt inclined to share about this restaurant because of the quality of service and friendliness I get every time I'm here. I have always had great servers, food that tastes wonderful, comes out in a timely manner and I will continue to come back. Also, I'm frequently greeted by one of the owners or managers and when I come in, he is extremely courteous and even knows what I usually order so that speaks great lengths about their leadership and customer service as well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fast service. Great food. Clean. Good prices. And they have alcohol! What more could you ask for :) I will definitely be back! Glad to find a great breakfast place so close to my house!"}
{"text":"The breakfast food is delicious! I've only been a few times, but every time I left full and satisfied. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the service was very good. I recommend trying their Protein Pancakes or their Idaho Hot Skillets!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast/brunch restaurant. My friend and I went on a Sunday morning and there was no wait to get a nice booth. Our waitress was efficient and excellent. She recommended the half skillet & half protein pancakes which tasted delicious and fresh. I  would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who does not want to wait 30 minutes to get a table at a brunch restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A straightforward breakfast restaurant executed very well. Menu is everything you would expect, they do have some 'Arizona Mexican' options such as Sonoran Burrito and Green Chili and Chorizo Omelette. Pancakes are deliciousness, I really like the protein and blueberry. Sometimes when I go I want an espresso drink, but they only have coffee. I've been here a bunch, and definitely prefer it over chain places like IHOP, Denny's, Village Inn, etc."}
{"text":"Lots of excellent choices.  Food had a wonderful taste.  Service was fast and efficient   Protein pancakes are outstanding."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast!  The blueberry pancakes are so light and tasty!  Incredible!  Will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"On my days off, this us my go-to location for breakfast goodies! I can find a meal that fits my diet, while savoring each delectable bite. The pancakes are great, along with hearty bacon and eggs that are cooked to order. It is also very welcoming, as my server, Bailey, has treated me like a familiar face and good friend each time I come by. Excellent service and good food will keep me coming back ^,^"}
{"text":"I've been over 10 times and every time it is great. Half and Half (protein pancakes and skillet) is amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Clubhouse salad is my favorite. Only place that I know of where the chicken is warm. What a nice touch. Nice size serving. Like that they put a pitcher of iced tea on the table. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was good and comforting. The menu provided carb smart options with their protein pancakes and other option. Prices were reasonable. The staff was very friendly and they provided plenty of parking."}
{"text":"US Egg is a good, no wait breakfast joint that I frequent quite often. I've only ever been here on a Saturday or Sunday, after a long night of drinking, but the food is always delicious, servers are friendly, and they give you huge portions. The protein pancakes are one of my favorite things to eat, as well as the Sonoran Burrito. I always leave this place really full with some good left overs."}
{"text":"After a super early flight into Phoenix, our party of 16 was quite hungry. I've read about the hype of U.S. Egg, but had to have a taste of it myself.  The verdict is in and this place is for real.    They have a very large menu and everyone in the party seemed to like what they got.  The biggest surprise was the bloody mary's were freaking excellent.  The waitress didn't miss a beat with our large party.  Food came out quickly and warm.  Overall, great experience.  PROS:  Beautiful waitresses Bloody Mary's Customer Service  Cons: Bathroom ran out of paper towels"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place over any Denny's or IHOP. The food is much better in quality, while being comparable in price range to other diners.  We were seated very quickly, and the waitresses were tentative and kind.  Great for large parties, and for anyone who needs some standard, fill-you-up breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"I found this DIAMOND over 7 years ago!! I continue to be amazed by the consistency of high quality service coupled with high quality food.  Living in Scottsdale there are so many choices to eat. Restaurants are everywhere. It is like a concrete jungle of eateries. The only way I have ever found to separate the pretenders from the real deal 5 star establishments is SERVICE, FLAVOR, VARIETY, CONSISTENCY AND EXECUTION!! US Egg understands that. They get it, which is why they are head and shoulders above any other breakfast and lunch eatery in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My food was fine.  My husband ordered ala cart and the waitress came back to ask if he wanted fruit, or something else because it dame with it.  He said no because he didnt want it, then we see the bill and she put down a mwal that was close to what he ordered but $3 more.  Didnt have time to argue about as we had somewhere to be so tgat was part of her tip.  Why dont servers do what you ask?"}
{"text":"This may seem like a better version of Denny's or IHOP, but US EGG stands alone! After you eat here you will understand. I'm super picky, and enjoy the finer things in life.  I went here on a layover several months ago and am now back! This is a beacon of breakfast food(never tried lunch here). I order an Idaho hash ( eggs, avocado, hash browns, bacon, chicken, tomatoes, onions and cheese along with a side of their famous protein pancakes) So, SO, So good! Just try it!"}
{"text":"Went to the one in old town for breakfast. My first time and it was delicious! The food was great, service fantastic! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not the same as I remember. Their food on my last visit was much less spectacular, and seemed almost pre made. On the plus side, it's a big restaurant and you can get seated very quickly. Also, our food came out in like five minutes after ordering...though in not sure that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I'm from the city (NYC that is) and when I walked in to US egg and saw the crowd and table placements I assumed I had walked in to iHop of Scottsdale but to my dismay I open the menu and read so many delicious and healthy meals I was hooked.  Despite the crowd I was sorted in less than 15 minutes.  Try the half & half! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The manager on duty did a great job handling the morning rush.  The bacon onion and pepper skillet tasted fresh from the garden!"}
{"text":"I found this online while in town for work. This restaurant looks nice, has great staff, has excellent food cooked to your liking, and very fair prices. I will put this on my list for next trip into town. Best service I've experienced in a long time, too."}
{"text":"My experience here sets the standard for Breakfast/Lunch diners.  A warm and down to earth staff with great food selection at affordable prices with quality ingredients.  Impeccably clean with fast and efficient service.  Food is delivered to your table fast and delicious.  There is plenty of parking as well.  Will definitely be coming back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"There are few times in my life when I can remember walking into a restaurant on it's very first day of business and getting a flawlessly prepared meal that is absolutely affordable and delicious accompanied with friendly and down to earth staff willing to provide great service.  I recommend the breakfast triple play and then substitute a waffle for the pancakes. You will be in culinary heaven."}
{"text":"Great service.   Nice to have the coffee pot on table."}
{"text":"I've been here before while in Scottsdale. I really like the food. I've had the 1/2 &1/2 which I think is awesome!   The gentleman at the door is always so nice and always there. Today I had a protein breakfast. It was good just what I needed! Yes I think you can mess up eggs but they didn't. A big plus. Bacon & sausage was cooked just right. No complaints on the food.   I was disappointed in my server this time. She came to my table 4 times..................  1) to take my order 2) to drop off my food 3) to drop off my check 4) to take my money   Normally the service is excellent, but I must say, Amber I was truly disappointed. I'm sure I'll be back for the food but not in Amber's section again! I'm sure I would've given 5stars if my service was good. I hate bad service."}
{"text":"The food and staff are great! We went to three different places (on a Sunday after 11) looking for good breakfast before heading to the airport. All three had wait time around an hour. I guess it was fate because we came here and only had to wait about 15 minutes. We were seated outside where we were told it was heated to about 78 but if we weren't pleased to ask for another table. Oh, I forgot to mention the average temperature here is usually in the high 60s low 70s but it's about 59 today. Of course the wind was whipping pretty hard. So, we got another table inside very quickly. The waitress didn't take anytime to come over and took our order. They were very accommodating and allowed for substitutions (with minimal cost). The portion sizes are huge! I ate EVERY bite and shouldn't need anything else to eat for the day. The protein pancakes were as promised, something to come back for. If I ever come back to the area, I will definitely come here. Besides, there are so many other things on the menu that I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, and great environment!   Was visiting Scottsdale and was looking for somewhere for breakfast on Yelp, and remembered seeing this place on my way up the night before. Got there (it was around noon), and was immediately sat and the staff was very helpful. Staff consisted of cute 20-something girls, which was an added... ahemmmm... bonus?   Anyhow, got the US Egg cheesesteak sandwich which was awesome,  and my friend got one of the skillet items which was equally tastey. All with drinks for about $28 with tax and tip. Would love to do it again!"}
{"text":"I have to rave about this place....  Not only are the portions HUGE, but the food is absolutely delicious. The boyfriend and I split the Hawkeye omelette, which has chicken, avocado, bacon, and melty cheese all in  fluffy omelette pillow. Not only did this save us money, but we were still stuffed.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice in one week protein pancakes were excellent. The standard eggs and sausage with side of fruit was very good. The fruit plate was very large with a good assortment of fruit. Sourdough toast was also very good. I highly recomend this place."}
{"text":"A few of us went here for breakfast. What a nice treat. A great location with optional seating outside with decent views. I went with your traditional breakfast, eggs, hash browns well done, toast, bacon and sausage. Based on the pics I saw on yelp I went with a side order of bacon, which was the right call. The bacon was juicy and greasy, hehe...just how you want your bacon.    As for toast and English muffins, they were slopped with butter, where most places skimp on the butter, this place did no such thing.   I tried the omelet, but wasn't thrilled with it, but that was after everything I ate, so that may have been part of it.   Also I ordered a fresh apple juice, which was more like an apple cider for us Michiganders...overall, I'd be back. The menu was huge; much more for me to try."}
{"text":"The food was good, and our server and her trainee were very nice and helpful.  But the food was just good (which deserved 4 stars) but the manager seemed more interested in talking to the hostess than smiling at customers or asking them how they're doing as he walked by.  It's a chain, what should I expect?"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! All the food tastes delicious, I highly recommend the protein pancakes! Even management is wonderful here, there is a guy with glasses and curtly hair that is always keeping things orderly. He is  definetly the glue of this location, I called one time as they messed up a take out and he had  a card in the mail to me within a few days. One small thing that makes a HUGE difference for me is they cross out the tip on to go orders, I hate Tipping on them handing me my food and they take that awckward part put, it's small to other people but one reason why I always get take out from them."}
{"text":"Was there with a girlfriend at lunch time today. We both decided on breakfast. We both had their special combo; 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and a choice of a meat or bread or hash browns. I opted for meat so my meal came with 4 bacon strips. My friend got the toast. Great food and service. Coffee good also. Loved the fact that they gave us a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee so we could indulged and not have to flag down a server."}
{"text":"My friends and I made it to U.S. Egg yesterday for brunch.  This place was absolutely bustling!  Luckily, our wait was great -- only 10 minutes.  This gave us time to go over the sizable menu.  I had the Sonora Breakfast burrito.  It was SO freakin' good!  Lots of chorizo -- which was surprising, because that seems to be the first thing they skimp on.  It also had peppers, eggs, and several other very yummy things.  It came with potatoes that were really good too.  My friends got one of the veggie frittatas, and thought it was fabulous.  Our waitress was sweet, chatty, and very helpful.    The only thing that wasn't great was the coffee -- it was just OK.  This is one of those places that should become a weekend routine!"}
{"text":"It's exactly what you expect. The food is quality and predictable. The staff is friendly and checks in with you regularly. During Spring training they exceed service expectations. The patio seating is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Clean and very friendly staff, the menu had great options. I ordered the eggs, with shaved turkey and fruit. Healthy portions and very fresh and tasty. Noise was at decent level where you can still hold a conversation. Great place! PS the coffee was also good"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday mud-morning and the wait was just about 10 minutes, not too bad. Had the protein waffle & bacon. The waffle was delicious and I would order it again! A friend ordered the club sandwich & it looked great!"}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant must mean Americans like processed food as that is all they serve.   I got sausage links right out of a box, with powdered flavorless eggs and hash browns straight out of a bag.   Go down the street either way and there are breakfast places with fresh food for the same price."}
{"text":"I love coming here... My favorite thing is they put a whole pitcher of water or coffee on the table and leave it so you can help yourself!!!  It's the best after a night of drinking.. Food is good, not great .. But like I said good after a night of drinking. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! $30 for breakfast for 2, but large portions ! Love the atmosphere and photographs."}
{"text":"OMG the protien pancakes get 5 stars. They are amazing. I also like that they have healthy menu options and totally sinful menu options too.  The rest of the food is pretty good. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak, eggs Benedict and mimosas. Wasn't busy, but at 10 am on a Friday what do you expect?  We were taking up table space, granted, as we visited with friends,  but it would have been nice if they had offered to refill waters.  Will be back next time in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There was a time I ate there every week. I loved the Santa Fe skillet. It had great chicken and chorizo together. Then I started getting them with a pile of hash browns and very little else. I ate there today in Chandler because it was closest and we were looking for breakfast. Same exact thing. Totally tasteless almost entirely hash browns for $12."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about US Egg, except the protein pancake. It's the only reason I'd have a preference to dine here rather than any other breakfast place. The coffee isn't too special and often times it's chaotic. The protein pancake with a smidge of butter is all you need."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. Great omlettes and breakfast choices. They also serve lunch which my wife always orders. Great staff and the owners are always present and helping with operations which is a cool touch in my opinion."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot. Hash browns were golden brown no burned spot. Bacon was crispy and delicious. I also had scrambled eggs with an English muffin. Never had a muffin so good. The service was amazing and food came out quick. At least 2 different servers came up to me and asked if I was good. The Manger came and refilled my water. Good spot to eat excited to bring the gf here next time."}
{"text":"The half and half meat lovers was bomb.com it was so delicious and appealing that I didn't even get a pictute. It was definitely a lot of food. I end up taking it home. 11/10 recommended!!! Also my friends loved the blood Mary."}
{"text":"good grub and fast.  me and my wife have been there like 5 times and each time it is always great."}
{"text":"Good easy place!  Breakfast food is great and I'd stick with that!  I ordered a sandwich which wasn't too bad, wife had their special pancakes and definitely won."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg seems to be the poor man's version of The Good Egg.  Similar decor, similar ambiance, similar menu, but the food just can't compare.  Mind you, it's not bad and beats the hell out of Denny's, but it's closer to a  2-star experience than a 4-star experience.  My eggs were overcooked,  the service was mediocre, and during spring training the place is packed with Giants fans (not the reason for the 2-star review, I'm just saying)."}
{"text":"Ok.  I just paid essentially $12 for a disappointing brunch, and I'm not thrilled about this.  The Sonoran breakfast burrito sounded great-- eggs, chorizo, green chilies, jack cheese, and salsa are among my favorite things to put in a burrito.  This is gonna be awesome, I thought reading the description.  I was hungry and excited about breakfast.  Oh, how let down I was with that first bite! Reality intruded on my fantasy breakfast with extreme prejudice.  I had been burrito- blocked! First of all, the \"meat\" was not chorizo.  Chorizo is deliciously greasy (that good red grease that lets you know its for real) and bursting with spicy flavor.  My burrito had \"chorizo\" in it -- flavorless Sysco breakfast crumbles.  There were also some green things that may have been chilies, and some onions, but neither tasted like the things they were masquerading as.  The only thing I tasted in the whole thing was the splat of tomato salsa on top.  Seriously, the breakfast burrito from McDonald's had more flavor than this poor creature they served me! And you know I can't stand  McDonald's, it is the court of last resort! I was glad to see a decent selection of fruit on my $1.25 upcharge fruit plate.  No complaints there, at least until our server knocked the table flag (the standup display advertising specials, don't know what its officially called) over in the middle of it. Service was not great either, which also fed my irritation about breakfast.   We might be back (I'll get something else), but I can't see being a regular."}
{"text":"This review is going to kill me, because I want so badly to give them 4-5 stars but just can't...  I have been coming to US Egg since it first opened. Their protein pancakes had me at hello and have been a staple of mine nearly every weekend, whether it be with my wife, my friends, or my parents. I lived in Los Angeles for nearly 5 years, and every time I came back to AZ I hit up US Egg. It seemed like every time I went I received a delicious, piping hot breakfast from an attractive, attentive, happy wait staff. I thought they would be my go-to breakfast place for life...  However, a few years ago they started to branch out, and just like many mom and pop places that try to spread their wings, they fly too close to the sun and their consistency suffers greatly. Over the last 2-3 years, EVERY time I bring someone here, raving about the food and the service...there's a problem. Sausage has been undercooked, eggs were cold, even my beloved pancakes (No! Not my protein pancakes!!!!!) have had zero blueberries in them, have been cold, or have been burned beyond recognition. My parents have had so many bad experiences with their unusually inattentive wait staff that they refuse to go with me now that I have moved back to Scottsdale. It seems like the place is always in a rush and too busy for their own good.  About the only consistent thing about this location is its inconsistency. I have eaten there 3 times in the last month I have been back, and each time has been different. I took my brother in law after a long, early morning hike on a Saturday and the place was just like I remembered...great, friendly wait staff with wonderful, hot breakfasts. We both had the eggs combo with protein pancake upgrade and it was delicious; thick, crispy bacon, piping hot eggs cooked to order, deliciously hot and fluffy pancakes with almond slivers, blueberries, and granola. The other two times...not so much. Both times food was undercooked or cold, and when we requested new food, they nuked it and passed it off as new food!!!!! REALLY?! If there is a bite out of it sweetie, we can tell it's the same sausage patty! It is really disappointing, because this place used to be a bastion of consistency and quality that made it a staple of Old Town breakfast places. I give it 3 stars because there are glimmers of great quality here and there. I just hope that they can find the consistency that once made them one of the best places in town for breakfast."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while with a few buddies. We always order the protien pancakes with the meat lovers skillet. One of my favorite breakfasts around."}
{"text":"Very good. The place is set up really nice. It is very clean. The staff are friendly. If tou want a great breakfast this is the place to go. Will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Scottsdale we visit this place. Great food and good service. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"This brunch spot is dynamite! The food here is always consistent and relatively inexpensive. Not to mention that the service is amazing. Whenever I visit Scottsdale I have to come here. Weekend waits can be long which is expected. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I offer this as a warning to others:  My experience at this restaurant was exceptionally bad, although it wasn't due to the atmosphere or the service. The food my girlfriend and I received was undercooked, soggy, and unseasoned. We should have sent it back considering the price, which was not cheap. I was immediately sick, and spent the rest of the day lying in bed or in the restroom.  This is the first and last time I will be eating here. Quite simply, this was the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here at 9:30 am on a Sunday and the entire parking lot was full. I was expecting a really long wait, but it was only 10 minutes! This is your pretty average brunch/breakfast place. Reasonably priced, a large variety or egg dishes, pancakes, and waffles. I've never had any of the lunch food, but they do have it.   Our service was great, the waitress was very friendly, and the food came out quick. The Western scramble was good, and there was definitely a lot of food!  Overall, a pretty standard brunch spot, good for a quick in and out, cheap meal."}
{"text":"For a great, slightly greasy American breakfast, there's nothing better than US Egg.  Sure,the tables are sometimes sticky, the menu (and the mural of America) is a little ,and there's often a short wait to get a table. But the food (especially the Jack and Avocado omelet - yum!) is great, the prices are reasonable, and the servers are always friendly. And even though there is often a line, they never rush you to finish your coffee. Also, the Scottsdale US Egg is a great people-watching venue. Whether you're an ASU student grabbing a post-church bite to eat with your parents, or a gal out with your friends after a Camelback hike, or a slightly hungover woman wearing last night's halter top, sitting across from a some guy  you met last night-- and you can't quite remember his name -- US Egg will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Favorite local Breakfast spot, Been coming here a few times when I can but I'm a sucker for the French toast and at this place it surely does the trick everything is good here, and if you are an egg person this is the spot, I love it and would recommend it to anybody, I been to the one in Phoenix on Greenway and i feel this one in Scottsdale is the better one because of its location with the other breakfast spots are nearby in the old town area and the fact you don't see the older people (grandma/grandpa) and kids at this location because I guess families tend to stay away from this side of town that's cater to the single life. But overall I love this spot, ill choose this over Dennys and IHOP anyday!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Good size portions. Hash browns a little oily but very tasty. Service was good. There were no low price breakfast specials. So it tended to be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Not sure why we didn't come here sooner (we've lived in the Kierland area for 8 yrs)! We've been here several times already. Excellent breakfast food and always attentive wait staff. They offer gluten free options too! BTW, Brooke rocks! Ask for her section. She always has a smile and that starts your day off right!"}
{"text":"Protein pancake (not sure how much protein) is absolutely awesome...I don't even look at the menu when I go...usually get a side of eggs too.  Surup is good but you might need to ask for for.  fresh OJ too...love this place and go there everytime I'm in Phx"}
{"text":"The Boyfriend raved (and apparently the restaurant itself raves) about its famous protein pancakes, so, of course, we had to go!  We went around 11:30am on a Monday morning it was a long weekend) and they place was less than half full. We were seated promptly and drinks orders taken. The server was great about coming back and getting our food orders in a timely manner as well.  We ordered coffee, protein pancakes, the arizona frittata, and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Coffee was good. Just good ol' plain coffee, so I can't complain. The arizona frittata included mushrooms, onions, peppers, and spinach with sour cream on top and a side of salsa all a la egg. It was good, after you put generous amounts of salt and pepper on it, but The Boyfriend still thought it was a bit bland.  The biscuits and gravy were good, no complaints.  Now onto the important stuff: protein pancakes! The order comes as 2 extra large pancakes that have lots of blueberries and crunchy granola in every bite. I was surprised that the pancakes were so tasty, especially since it's healthy (bleh :P)! The crunchy granola gave them an extra kick because it was a different texture and I'd was rather have bits of crunch in my pancakes than mushy oatmeal-like oats. Anyway, if I ever go again, I'm just ordering the protein pancakes!  BTW, the pancakes were so big, we were only able to finish one, so I brought the second one home to the Bay Area and my dad ate it within a day!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and one of the few breakfast places I've been to that actually serves corn beef hash (I love the stuff). It was pretty busy both times, but the waitresses I've had on my visits were prompt and pleasant. Definitely a place I'd go to regularly on the weekends."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly, food was good, not great.  I ordered the california benedict and the hollandaise sauce was a bit too thin for my liking.  All and all i did like the vibe of the place, but the food was just above average."}
{"text":"You might not realize it, but U.S. Egg is kind of a mecca for people trying to live a healthy lifestyle and eat a high-protein diet. Yes, they have all the standard breakfast and brunch foods, but if you look at the back of the menu there is a section titled \"Proteins\" where they list protein pancakes, steak and eggs with a sliced tomato instead of hash browns, eggs with a hamburger patty, omelettes with bacon, salads with lettuce, meats, and cottage cheese, etc. There's even a gluten-free option and it all tastes really good!  Plus, every time I've eaten here, or at the location at Baseline and Mill, service has been great... prompt and with a smile. So if you're looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch, show your patriotism and head for U.S. Egg!"}
{"text":"5 stars every time we come here! Coleen was our server and she was great! Everything always comes out super fast and delicious. Get the half and half with protein pancake - I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We have eaten breakfast the last couple of mornings at this location of U S Egg and we have been very impressed.  My  Husband got the ham and cheese omelet - with wheat toast. We love the wheat toast we get in Arizona - better than in the South. He really enjoys the omelets.  I am an iced tea drinker and they bring me a pitcher of tea along with my husbands pot of hot coffee and an entire pitcher of ice water!!!! It is great. I got the whole grain pancakes with delicious blue berries! This is a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"We had a tasty and filling breakfast here; and the staff was attentive. The granola parfait was a generous helping for a breakfast and the gluten-free menu provided me with many choices. The eggs Benedict were well done; the plate lasted me until dinner! We will return."}
{"text":"I don't know about you but a great Friday night for me, normally eludes to a not-so-great Saturday morning, at least that was the case until I stumbled, more literally than I care to admit on Yelp, into US Egg.  Ok so it might be a little chain-y and menu's aren't crazy creative, but when it comes to great morning after stodge, you really can't top this place. Typically American large portions of; scrambled egg, hash browns and a choice of bacon or sausage (little tip, ask for a combination) all for under $10 is an absolute steal!  Throw in unlimited (oh how I love the land of the free) coffee and a chocolate chip pancake to measure and you're well on your way to rolling home a happy camper without denting your wallet!"}
{"text":"Great service, good service and fantastic food. I am a picky eater and always request my meals a specific way, which typically gets lost in the translation.  Not here, they nailed it.  Best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"This coffee is to die for. I don't love strong coffee and their coffee is very drinkable: I couldn't stop! The food and service was prompt. I went around 1245 pm on a Sunday and was shocked that I could get a table right away. They have their own parking lot too! A plus! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say, my wife and I love this place.  It's our local go-to spot for breakfast or brunch.  However, if you go anytime before 11am, expect to wait a solid 15 minutes or so for a table.  They're busy, because they're popular, but they also staff the restaurant well, so the wait isn't as long as it could be if it weren't staffed as well.  The servers aren't overly friendly or conversational, but I think that goes back to the fact that they are so busy in the mornings.  I give them a pass because the food and prices are so legit.  Without fail, my wife and I always order the Protein Pancakes with a side of eggs.  We don't typically get into ruts like that, because we like to try new things, but you CAN'T beat these pancakes!  Try them.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Four of us went there for breakfast on Saturday morning.  The business was busy but not crazy and we were sat within 15 minutes.  The menu looked great but here comes the review.  We ordered two Idaho skillets, one omelette and a French dip.  Skillet 1 was acceptable if you don't mind that US Egg's version  of melted cheese, which means you have to search for it.  I did find some.  The 'hash browns' were shredded potatoes that most likely were microwaved then thrown on the grill for 30-60 seconds.  Hardly what is considered hashbrowns.   Over all it was OK but hardly anything to order again.  Skillet 2 came out with the wrong style eggs, OK, that can happen to anybody and was quickly remedied by the waitress.  It was passable with the same 'hashbrowns' and dry chicken.  Again, not something worth ordering again.  Omelette was an interesting omelette of which I can do far better at home on.   The entire leafs of spinach were essentially folded into what can best be described as scrambled eggs.   Could just be US Egg has their own version of omelettes also.  Same story on the 'hashbrowns.'  French dip came with au jus which is definitely required.  The roast beef was extremely dry and the bun likely a day old and dry also to where you needed the au just for both.  We didn't follow up with a manager as we were hungry and figured it was just a lesson learned.   We're located in the valley and are in this part of Scottsdale frequently  and now have been able to cross this breakfast establishment off our list.  FYI there is a Denny's across the street that might just do better."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast every time I come here!  Service very Good.  I got half and half today, 2 protein pancakes and a half avocado, tomato, bacon skillet.  It was very Good!  It's too much for me for one meal, it travels ok and heats up well.  You gotta try if you want a simple good well priced breakfast,  way better than those other National Chains whose names begin with a D or I."}
{"text":"This place was great and had a large menu.  Ordered off their low carb menu section and it was delicious.  Service was quick and food came out REALLY fast!  My girlfriend and I both had different omelettes and they were great, but it was hard to choose because all their low carb stuff looked delicious and they had lots of specials too.  Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Wow - horrible food and manager.  Wish there were negative stars for this place!  Eat out a lot and travel all over.  Was excited to have eggs benedict but this food was terrible - not worthy of eating!  My friend had chicken and waffles.  Chicken tenders only thing edible.  Eggs ordered over medium were over cooked to the point of being like rubber - gravy was nasty and the ranch dressing to dip tenders in was watered down.  What a disappointing experience.  Manager said she would talk to kitchen when we said we had already sent back food and still crappy.  Took $20 off $26 for meals and really didn't care if we return.  Have lived in Scottsdale for 26 years and can name many places to get fantastic breakfast food for half the price.  Do yourself a huge favor and eat someplace else!!  The young man that was our server was fantastic and deserves to work at a better restaurant so he can make better tips.  We took good care of him with tip since not his fault.  Obviously lousy management."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how great this place is. Good food and quick service for how busy they are! And the price wasn't crazy unlike some other brunch places in the area. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this place.  I head out to U.S. Egg a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are seated speedily, and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The owner is gracious, and the waitresses are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is light.  The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The menu has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the spinach florentine (try it; i promise you won't regret it).   I've heard tell that the veggie benedict and eggs over easy are remarkable, as well.    Servers leave a pitcher of ice cold water with us as we eat--they don't pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can't think of a better place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  Really, just okay. That's the issue. You have amazing food, but then the lack of seasoning just makes the food.. ok food. I wish I had more to say, but I really don't, other than that service was that to be expected of a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow.  Coffee not the best.  Great menu - plenty of choices. The food was fantastic.  Go for the Idaho Skillet."}
{"text":"The coffee pitcher on the table is a key at this chain. Somehow though, the coffee in the pot was lukewarm after 15 minutes. I tried the protein waffle and it needed more items inside to help it along - it seems like they skimped and I had to rely heavily on the syrup and butter to get through the dense waffle. Another person had a run of the mill omelette and standard hash browns. The construction is making parking and getting to the place a mess, so keep driving to Old Town to find better and more creative choices."}
{"text":"I picked up a to go bagel sandwich before work this morning.  It was so fresh and delicious!!  It had sliced tomato, egg, and a fresh bagel.  The eggs had such a light and healthy flavor, and this was the freshest bagel I've ever had. It came with hash browns on the side, and a glass of orange juice that tasted freshly squeezed.  I would like to go and have a sit down breakfast here, and try some of the great variety of dishes that are on the menu."}
{"text":"Always friendly service. The food is always delicious and great portion to price ratio. Even the coffee is super tasty (they must use their own blend, no folgers here)! Plus, they offer flavored non-dairy creamers. When you are ready to boogie, they offer you drinks for the road. The only dish that i thought was just average, not super tasty was the lunch club sandwich. The deli meat reminded me of those \"land O frost\" prepackaged deli meats sold next to the hot dogs in the grocery store, nothing bad or gross, just underwhelming. I also didn't care for the fries on the side, too greasy and no flavor. Apart from the underwhelming sandwich, everything is always quality, fresh and yummy. And I have always had a smiling and attentive service on each visit. Great breakfast and lunch spot. Our go to brekky joint, if you will! (They even serve bloody marys and irish coffee)"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite breakfast place of our little hiking group and my very good friend after yoga..=)  US Egg has always been our number one choice to have good breakfast especially after a good workout when your body just needs more fuel for energy. This place has always people waiting outside for tables because it's always packed..which is a good sign especially for first timers that the food most especially is worth waiting for..=)  My good friend and I, more often than not, always get our breakfast fix here with the good old American pancakes, well protein ones for my friend, crisp bacons, eggs, crispy hash brown as we like it, coffee and tea, or occasionally some corned beef hash. We also like their most recent addition, the Cornhuskers, consisting of two pancakes, two toasted bread, 2 eggs, 4 bacons, which is big enough for two people! =) Price is great for the amount of food you shell out for..This is our little spot after working out in the morning and we will never get tired of going here. So happy that we have this locally owned restaurant that serves good food! =)"}
{"text":"Delicious food with great service.  Anytime they drop a whole carafe of coffee on my table when I order a coffee, I know it's going to be a good day!  I ordered the pancakes which were whole wheat and delicious with a half order of a skillet that had chicken bacon and avocado and tomatoes.  Delicious!!  I also ordered a boiled egg and it was great too!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to an US Egg restaurant before, but you better believe I will be back - especially to this location if I can help it! Nicole waited on me and even gave me a pitcher to refill my soda. She was attentive and kind. She was also great at upselling/suggesting without being pushy. She got me to get a mimosa when I originally ordered a Diet Coke as well as two others in a booth nearby. Yum! She personally connected with the customer in the booth behind me as he seemed like a regular.  She was also knowledgeable about gluten free options for a guest. The food was excellent! I will definitely be getting a spinach/mushroom omelette again! Finally, the whole staff was welcoming. Next time I want to get a waffle for sure!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long, long time.  The Hawkeye w jalapeño was great.  We had a party of 6 with a lot of modifications and the server nailed it.  We need one of these in LA!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and found US egg on instagram. The pictures lived up to the expectation of the food. I had a skillet and my mom had the French toast. My skillet was awesome and my moms French toast was pretty good. She got the basic French toast. It wasn't anything amazing but still good and hit the spot. Staff was also very friendly and helpful. We would defiantly recommend and would go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, best coffee ever & great service. We where looking for somewhere to eat, and saw an advertisement sign spinner standing on the corner, turned around and went back. It was worth every bit. Looks small from the outside, but a lot of room inside."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with my girlfriend before driving out to LA. The protein pancakes were delicious, and the eatery had a nice homely vibe to it. However, the huge depiction of the United States on one of their walls is a cheap simplification at best.."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place have 4 stars but I guess some people like their eggs, bread and pancakes served lukewarm...  For me, this place is best at 3 stars just to be nice.   I'm sorry for all those U.S egg fans out there but I take my breakfast seriously. My breakfast better be hot or you will get a very grump attitude from me! I thought hot breakfast should be a no brainer?? Unfortunately, I guess I have to request it to be hot and fresh out of the pan and not to expect that a place that serve solidly on breakfast should know any better. Oh I am sorry you don't serve solidly on breakfast?? Then you probably should take the word eggs out because you don't take your eggs seriously! Serve it hot or don't serve it at all!!!"}
{"text":"We went here based on the Yelp reviews......they were on the money.....very good breakfast menu....service was good and the atmosphere was very bright. .....our omlettes were made of fresh ingredients and the side of fruit was excellent. ....great spot for breakfadt."}
{"text":"Our family had a delightful brunch at U.S. Egg.  The wait was short and the service great.  We all loved our meals, especially the unusually delicious pancakes."}
{"text":"The Big Jim's omelette has made this location of the chain up to five stars. The omelette only has white meat chicken , cheese and mushrooms inside, but it was that Big Jim mushroom sauce that gets poured over the top that took this dish literally over the top. It was creamy and dreamy and a great suggestion by the purple tinted hair very nice waitress. Just a good flavor in every bite. The solid hash browns and English Muffin rounded out at nice breakfast at about $12. Protein pancakes also still getting good reviews.  The only issue here is that they use a Wheat batter for pancakes and waffles. They need to find some buttermilk and then it could crack the Big 5 in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"perfect breakfast spot with quality ingredients and reasonable prices.  definitely enjoy my brunches here with my family.  service is fast and efficient and wait time is usually 20 minutes on busy mornings. will definitely return!"}
{"text":"LOVE! I brought my niece in while her mommy got an hour to herself for a haircut and everyone was so accommodating! The food was really delicious and I felt like the value for it all was on point. I also got my own pot of coffee (which I needed, thankyouverymuch!) above all, my niece was happy and ate all of her breakfast"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Highly recommend this place for breakfast.  They are family owned so if you come often, you feel a sense of belonging.  Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast for a very reasonable price. Huge portions and great service. I really can't ask for more when it comes to reliable spots for a brunch. We took some visiting family and we were all really happy with what we ordered - yay!  My recommendation is the half and half with protein pancakes - I crave those pancakes regularly! And I would say prepare to wait a bit on weekends."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service, I wish I could remember the sweetheart who served us, I think it was McCall or something unique of that sort? She deserves a raise !!! I got the meat lovers skillet, with the suggestion of our server, and I just about cried with satisfaction, I truly wish I were exaggerating. Very cute, classic-American, atmosphere and I will absolutely be back for that dang skillet, it's huge and able to be saved for later. Thanks to you, my morning was one of the best yet!"}
{"text":"Great service,  reasonably priced, and most importantly great food!  Large portions,  and the staff is constantly checking in,  filling your drinks,  and taking great care of you.  And not to mention walking distance to Scottsdale stadium."}
{"text":"2nd time I have been here, great breakfast restaurant !  Yummy  breakfast , fast friendly staff! The wait staff are pretty nice and usually  typical breakfast places have grumpy staff ( I don't blame them I'm not a morning person lol)  Staff seems to very well organized & restaurant is clean and happy!   I have had the same waitress both visits , she is very sweet & told me the protein pancakes were nothing to be afraid of! And she was right- very delicious!   Love they serve cocktails & beer!"}
{"text":"Shoule be zero stars! So, we have been here a few times before and everything was totally fine. Today, I was there with my family and we were in the back by the patio, and on the patio there is a bird flopping around, bleeding, obviously hurt...all 6 of us AND the table next to us that had kids kept looking and worrying, we told the waitress 3 times to.tell someone (she did) and she told some guy eho worked there and thought the bird was dead...we kept waiting for them to put a box on top or save it...anything...but instead  they called their property management company and they said they'd be out in a while to take care of it...BUT WE WERE EATING and my kids and the tables next to us had kids that were all sad and hiding their faces...still nothing happened we were watching the bird. So my father started calling around for vets...we were about 500 feet away from an emergency vet, so he got a box and scooped the bird in to the 'to go box' he was given, and him and I ran the still alive, flopping, bloody bird down the street  to the vet. When we came back, the table next to us thanked us. Then our food was cold, I tried to eat, but my patty melt was basically an old leather shoe even though I asked for med rare...my father lost his appetite and said he didn't want his food, but he would pay for it...but then the manager SARAH came over and asked 'if there was a problem'...i told her the story and my father interrupted me and just said 'don't worry i will still pay for my food' and she rudely said OH OK and walked away...not one person thanked my father except for THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!!! So I decide I'm going to go talk to someone...i feel my food was so crappy and my father was treated rude...but of course SARAH was in charge and agreed to speak to me, and I told her CALMLY, I feel like you guys could have comped my fathers meal, he took away a dying bloody bird that bothered us and the people next to us...and she gets loud and says 'I didn't know but I couldn't have moved you anyway because we were full! We called property management what else could we do!?!?!' And I said 'our waitress was awesome but I think with my horrible patty melt, and us watching that bird flop around about 6 feet away from us, you could have been kinder and more accomodating...' and while I'm talking she rolls her eyes and starts to look away and smirk...and I lost it...i told her 'since you want to act like this, I'm going to tell the school apt, my Scottsdale mommy blog and everyone I know at the schools down the street that you treated us badly, let dying rodents stay, and rolled your eyes and looked away while I'm trying to talk to you and that I've never been treated so shitty at a restaurant in my life'...and she slams her towel and gets up and says 'if you're cussing at me I'm walking away'....and she walked away! Some guy who was leaving with his family was laughing when I walked by and said 'I can't believe she walked away from you after all that\"...i said 'no kidding!!!' I guess he heard us. I will never come back and I will tell everyone at the 3 local schools I am involved in what happened! I am so disappointed and disgusted!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not typically a breakfast kind of guy, but occasionally I get a craving for breakfast foods. Whenever I get this craving, U.S. Egg is my go-to place. The half-and-half breakfast is the best of both worlds, you get a great egg and potato skillet plus their awesome protein pancakes."}
{"text":"Once again in town for medical appointments and stopped by for breakfast and lunch on consecutive days. The food was great, I especially like their grits at breakfast, but the egg dishes are really the best. Once again we had the pleasure of Bailey as our server, she is special, outstanding and prompt service, thank you."}
{"text":"Seriously, Spring Training would be nothing without US Egg. Located just a few blocks from Scottsdale Stadium (Home of the two time San Francisco Giants.. ahem), this place is a must-go before an afternoon game.   Why is US Egg so special? Well, even though there is a wait, you get FREE coffee? There is a private parking lot so no need to stress about parking either.   The food is awesome. Try the half and half - two protein pancakes (delish pancakes with slivers of almonds, oatmeal, and blueberries - SUPER FOODS!), and a skillet of your choosing. Skillets can come with bacon, chorizo, peppers, onions, you name it. And they are topped with a fried egg. Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.   Service is excellent and fast. Water is in a pitcher on your table so you don't have to wait for refills. As is coffee.  What else do you need?"}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding. The omelettes and skillet dishes were the best that we ever experienced. The pricing is good. There were lots of people. There was a 20 minute wait in a breakfast line. Obviously, other people have the same opinion about U.S. Egg, otherwise why would so many people wait in a breakfast line. We will gladly wait in that line again to repeat our good experience with that restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is just alright.  Prior to my sister's graduation, we stopped at US Egg, so my sister can grab breakfast with her classmates. When we were seated, there was still a pitcher of water, from the previous party, along with some trash that sat there for a good 10 minutes, before someone cleaned it off.  Not long after the table was cleaned off, our waitress quickly got our drinks and food ordered. But, when the food was delivered, the main server directed the other server to put a plate of food in front of mom, but she gives it to my dad instead and just walked away, leaving our poor waitress to make the switch.  Food portions are huge, so well worth your bang for your buck. I loved my cornbeef and hash dish. Unfortunately, a few of the staff's customer service skills could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Family owned since 1991 it says on the menu, and a nice clean place with some outdoor seating too.  Almost too clean, but I guess it's better to be that way than too dirty.  I had the Texas Omlette with Chili that was a good option.  Add a bit of Tabasco for kick and it's perfect.  Sitting outside under the deck and read the New York Times - was not rushed, but service was also attentive.  Good local joint for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  My friends got protein pancakes, I got biscuits and gravy.  Both were excellent.  A little pricey for breakfast, but way better than the Denny's across the street.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast since I was having a tire fixed next door. They did not disappoint!! The coffee was great and they even leave a carafe at your table so you never have to wait for a refill. I had the half and half with protein pancakes. It was so good!! Pancakes were loaded with blueberries. Server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Protein Pancakes are Incredible. This is a multi location family owned restaurant that always treats us great. The food is consistently delicious. No matter what you order you really cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place its perfect for breakfast and I gotta say the service was extraordinary.  I mean the waitresses all had smiles and came across like they really cared about the customers here.  Now this is a place I'll definitely come back to when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here to eat on the way to work it's always a good experience.  I'd say one step above dennys.  Servers are fast and attentive.  Just what I need when I'm on the go. ..)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))"}
{"text":"One of many good breakfast/brunch options in the Scottsdale area.  We were a group of 9 including children.  We were seated promptly and the waitress was patient with all the chaos associated with hungry young kids.  Coffee was served quickly and was above average; as were the juices.  Food arrived promptly.  The omelettes I sampled in our group were all flavorful and the pancakes were delicious.  Overall a good experience for hungry people.  Highly recommend a visit if you are in the mood for this type of food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast spot!  We've never had to wait for a table, which is definitely nice when you're looking for your first meal of the day.  The menu is large and includes both breakfast and lunch items.  I love that if you order water or iced tea, they bring a pitcher to your table.  The service has always been friendly and despite how large of a restaurant it is, we have never had to wait a long time for our food to come out."}
{"text":"Fast seating for large parties.  They now serve GLUTEN FREE waffles and French toast! Yummy!!  Bacon is awesome too"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars every time!   The Protein pancakes are a favorite for a good reason.   They're great and filling with the right kind of ingredients.   I recommend the 1/2 and 1/2 which is two good sized protein pancakes with 1/2 a skillet variety and one egg.  Their iced tea is decent and we've always had service that was at least better than average.   Easy to find and reasonable prices.   Winner!  (Now why they are listed under 'Burgers' instead of breakfast, well who knows.)"}
{"text":"This place gets your order out faster than any breakfast restaurant I've ever been to. Awesome food, big portions, plenty of seating, very friendly all-female waitstaff."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast/brunch by far! Closes at 2:30 so get there early because the place fills up quickly and there is a steady stream of folks waiting to partake in a great meal. Indoor and outdoor seating. Waitstaff can be more attentive, but the place is always super busy! I tried a skillet...ham, sausage, mushrooms, bacon, and tomatoes on a bed of hash rounds then covered with cheese! DELICI'! All the food and beverages came very promptly to the table."}
{"text":"I thought my meal was OK. I ordered an omelette and had a cup of coffee. I thought it was a little pricey for the quality of food I had got. It seems kind of chain-ish. It seems to be quantity over quality here. You can get a much better breakfast across the street in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and both times I ate here it was during the weekend.   The place has been busy both times I was here. Inside is very bland and boring, I guess you could say it looks generic. We were seated fairly quickly given the 10 minute wait. Upon sitting down we noticed our glasses were dirty, this was the case the first time we ate here as well. Our sever was at our table to take our drink orders right away and she brought us clean glasses. The menu selection is big. The food quality is no better than Denny's and for more money. I love huevos rancheros and what they have here is not huevos rancheros, they use flour tortillas with the dish and it is overall bland. Same goes for the other dishes that my friends had, just bland. All the food came out luke warm but very fast. My friends over easy eggs were cooked thru. When my food came out I was given an English muffin with mold on it. The server immediately took the muffin away and brought another which was nice but received no apology from the manager. I wonder how many people ate muffins with mold on them.   Anyway, in a nutshell this place has questionable food quality and bland food to match the bland interior. But the service is quick and nice with easy parking."}
{"text":"Got management response. No...not my job to tell a young server the food was not prepared adequately...not his job...send something back to kitchen...take your chances. Food came out as these folks are trained. Management issue."}
{"text":"We rode here from Washington state for bike week and this is the best place we have been for breakfast by far. Our server Brittani has been great. Very fast and friendly. My wife had the half and half with the Santa Fe it was great. I had the club and it was also really good. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to US Egg and we were told that it is busy but worth the wait.  Well it was true...we waited about 25 minutes for our table (not bad for a Sunday morning).  The food was worth the wait....very fresh and hot.  A couple of mix ups on the order but they were corrected very quickly and did not interfere with anyone have to watch while the rest of eat.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to have a good breakfast or lunch.  Only negative is that it is a little noisy if you are trying to carry on a conversation with someone several seats away."}
{"text":"US Egg has become my parent's and my favorite breakfast place on our annual pilgramage to Phoenix to visit family. Our trip is not complete without at least one visit to this spot. The service is always great, as is the food. I am not usually a sweet breakfast person, but the Protein Pancakes are too good to pass up. I love that they offer the Half and Half, which includes a small order of the protein pancakes and a half skillet. Perfect for satisfying the sweet and salty cravings. The coffee is decent, which is all I ask for in a no frills breakfast spot. There is a large parking lot at this location, although it can get a bit crowded at peak breakfast time. If you are looking for a good, hearty breakfast or lunch, check this place out, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I had the Cheese Chorizo Omelette, coffee, and a side of Sausage. The Omelette was excellent but the side of sausage was horrible, I'm pretty sure it was microwaveable Jimmy Dean Sausage Links, no joke! Also, it's roughly 7 dollars for coffee and the a side of sausage which is outrageous.   I'll skip on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Had the protein pancake which was wonderful. The syrup sat on top and the pancake did not act like a sponge. The hash browns were not greasy or fried. They were light and the shredded potatoes did not clump together  they were lightly salted and so delicious. The scrambled eggs were exactly how I ordered them. I would go back in a heart beat"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here while traveling to Scottsdale. I am a picky eater and very health conscious. I loved this restaurant. The food was fresh and well prepared. We had the skillets. I'm carb adverse so it was easy to just not eat the hash browns. The dish was very well prepared. Great coffee. They gave us an entire pot and full pitcher of water too. The service was excellent from the time we were greeted at the door. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great place never disappoints , music ,people , like being at home for breakfast !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific service, Skylar! Excellent protein waffle & poached eggs! I'll be back from Sedona soon!  Keep up the great service!!!"}
{"text":"I had the half and half so I can get the famous protein pancakes. My girlfriend had the Turkey sausage with scramble eggs and English muffin.  the protein pancakes were delcious. The service was fast, I must say they do very well with handling crowd getting people seated."}
{"text":"All four items our family ordered were sub par. If your name is US Egg, you better know how to cook eggs. My omelet was an under seasoned scrambled egg folded over poorly cooked and under seasoned veggies ( they also shouldn't be wet). The salsa I asked to pour over my omelet was also bland so that didn't help.   The up-charged fruit that came with my dish was lukewarm and over ripe making it very bitter. Ew.   My husbands \"poached\" egg was over cooked making it hard as a rock. His $10 skillet was bland with under seasoned veggies, dry-as-a-bone chicken, and under cooked potatoes.   My kids' pancakes were way dry. They only picked the apples out and left the pancake.   Overall, we were way disappointed. I guess short shorts and beer Doesn't make for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"What a waste of money. You would think that a restaurant with Egg in its name could prepare eggs. Well i guess not. My over easy eggs came with a hard yolk and rubbery whites. My grits were hard and only warm. The chicken sausage was luke warm. The raisin toast was good, that's why they got a star. My wife ordered eggs Benedict. She also received hard boiled eggs and very little hollandaise sauce. I guess we need to find a better breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I love breakfast. The food here is really good; I just wish the service lived up to how good the food was. Our waitress never told us her name and was nonexistent throughout the meal. I also ordered a side of sourdough toast and never received it. I ordered the eggs benedict, like always, and I wasn't disappointed. My friend ordered a blueberry muffin that was by far one of the best muffins I've ever had. My other friend wanted to substitute something for eggs in her meal and the waitress refused to work with her and basically just told her she couldn't. The least she could have done was ask a manager first. I'd eat here again just because the food was good, but I'd hope the service was better next time."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes for the win. Nothing better after hiking Camelback.   Would recommend to anyone looking for a solid breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Food was best breakfast we have had - Half and Half with Protein Pancakes and omelet is best thing on menu!   Service was eggcellent!  We wanted to go back the next day to have another breakfast there before we left town."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not a fan of diner food.   Service was very friendly on a busy Sunday morning. Restaurant was huge, but the decor was a bit tacky. We had the Cali Eggs Benedict, protein pancakes, waffles, and a veggie skillet. After a night of debauchery, we needed some serious comfort food.  The portions are huge but everything was mediocre and forgettable.   Perfect example of why there is a portion control issue in our country.  I did like 1 thing, the double carafe coffee on the table so we can help ourselves with coffee refills."}
{"text":"This location needs to take a lesson from the I-17 and bell location.   We frequently eat at US egg so when work brought us to this side of town we decided to eat here.   The menu and the decor are the same but that is where the similarity ends.   The pancakes were tiny and my omelette was much smaller which seems impossible since it's a three egg omelette.  I get the same thing every time I go so was surprised the bill was higher; apparently at this location i get charged extra for my egg whites.  The english muffin was burnt and my avacado was bad (see picture).  Sadly a bad experience at a chain that is usually amazing."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, inexpensive and typical American breakfast fare.  Come here if you want fast service with a smile and predictable food.  I had the omelette with green chili.  I can't complain about a thing other than I did send every glass and cup on the table back to the dishwasher because they were gross.  Ask for 'to go' cups for your coffee and OJ."}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast spot in old town Scottsdale. They literally have everything for everyone to enjoy. Perfect for families or if you just want to eat alone. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and all the servers have smiles on their faces. Our server, Bailey was wonderful! Very attentive to our table and took great care of us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"US Egg is a great spot for a quick delicious breakfast, or a brunch with friends! Always good food and service."}
{"text":"Solid three stars. Food was tasty and well portioned and cooked. Anything outstanding? No.   I loved the wild blueberry pancakes and eggs and hash browns were appropriately cooked.   The laughable part of our meal was the soda- it came in these tiny glasses.  I know! Most people get their caffeine through coffee. However those of us who do not, prefer glasses of it that are larger than a shot glass.   There is a fun, naughty and sardonic Americana vibe to this place. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  Five of us went for breakfast after running the AZ Urban Race and it was exactly what we needed.  Huge menu and the food was great.  I heart breakfast food!  The prices are slightly pricey for a breakfast menu but nothing unreasonable.  Plus - you get a LOT of food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast before my flight to SFO and all the raving I've read on here is completely TRUE.  I got the Half & Half breakfast with the protein pancakes it comes with a scramble as well, more than enough food for two to share and cheap prices.  Loved the quick service and nice staff, I didn't have any problems with them like I read from some others so perhaps they resolved all the issues.  I would definitely recommend this place and visit again the next time I'm in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Get takeout from here all the time for lunch. The portions are large and delicious. The staff is always so friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my waffles with blueberries.  They said fresh blueberries but mine looked really small and dark (as if they had been defrosted).  Maybe I'm spoiled by the huge NJ blueberries.  Anyway, my waffles tasted fine with the berries (whatever they were).  The coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I went in for brunch this morning with my mom, and forgetting that every place would be slammed on a Saturday, we were having trouble finding a place that would not have a long wait. Fortunately, we went to this place last minute after calling ahead to ask for hold times to which I was replied with \"no wait time\".  We went in, and only had to wait for less than a minute for us to get a table in a full house. Our server, Ti, was EXCELLENT. She was very attentive, kind, and was super helpful when my mom accidentally spilled some ketchup on herself. We were very impressed with her service, that we gave her a handcrafted coap from our business that we run as a thank you.  I had the strawberry pancakes with over medium eggs and hashbrowns. She had the blueberry oatmeal with a side of eggs. It was so delicious, and It didn't make me feel super full and bloated that starched pancakes normally would. It's a huge benefit that they make whole wheat pancakes, with decent servings.   I like that they have the coffee pot and water pitcher readily available for you at the table. It takes pressure off the server and customer for when they want refills and how much of a serving they want.   The place was well lit, clean and the bathrooms were very clean too.   Overall, I had a great experience and would come back again!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from California so I was VERY excited to try this place! It's so hard finding a decent breakfast place where we live so I love when other states have them!   We walked in and the place wasn't too big nor too small, the wait was about 10 mins and they moved quickly to get every seated. Host and servers were very nice, efficient and helpful with the menu.   I loved the fact that they have a big and delicious gluten free menu! There was so many choices and options to accommodate food intolerances and allergies rather than the typical bland food most restaurants do, I could tell these people really took their time to make the menu right for everyone!   Upon bringing us our drinks they brought us a pitcher of whatever we ordered so we never went without a beverage... California... learn something from them!! I LOVED that seeing I drink a lot when I eat!   Food came out very quickly and hot! You can tell it wasn't sitting at the window for a long time. I ordered the gluten free veggie scramble with gluten free toast and hollandaise sauce. Food was delicious and a big portion!   Pricing was decent and normal and service was good. Good food and good service? A definite go to again when I visit."}
{"text":"Good food, good serves BUT the sign guy on the corner was the BEST part! Keep up the energetic work!"}
{"text":"U.S Egg is a lovely breakfast establishment here in Scottsdale. The atmosphere is fresh, clean and quite a bit more spacious than other dining establishments. Indoor and outdoor seating is available to suit your preference and the weather, and the interior has refreshingly simple and calming decor.  The menu has options for breakfast and lunch (could even be eaten for dinner), and has options not unlike a typical breakfast joint for the exception of their delicious protein pancakes stuffed with yummy granola, blueberries, almond slivers, and cinnamon! U.S Egg has several combo options so you can make the most variety out of your meal, not to mention many healthy options and alternatives if you have any dietary needs or restrictions.  My server was quite pleasant and the overall vibe of the restaurant was very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to breakfast or brunch at a lovely place."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable for breakfast/brunch.  Excellent service.  Huge portions.  Food clearly cooked to order. Great hash browns- no sogginess there.  Outdoor space is quiet And, love that they provide carafes/pitchers of beverages on the table so you don't have to be constantly asking for refills."}
{"text":"Doesn't disappoint. Food is always consistent and service is pretty quick, even when it's completely packed. Servers are always cheerful and full of energy. Good choice for a weekend breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Boom Susan!!! This place is solid. Ordered up 2 poached eggs extra crispy bacon, hash browns and toast. Everything was cooked perfect and the service was on point. Only complaint is that it's a little pricey but then again you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We like to support local businesses liek U S EGG. Great dependable food at reasonable prices. The pancakes are always a treat."}
{"text":"My family and I ate breakfast here on a Sunday morning while on vacation. There are a ton of options. I had the Hawkeye omolette. It was very good. My wife had poached eggs, bacon and pancakes. My daughters each had a nice sized kids breakfast for $5. The portions are generous and the prices were what you would expect for a decent breakfast. The service was excellent. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious, down home breakfast, then US Egg is the place for you. Don't expect to leave the place hungry...read on....  We had breakfast at US Egg before leaving town after a getaway night in Scottsdale. The interior is clean, the staff is very friendly, and the environment is bright, the signs are quirky, and it's a rather fun place. I ordered the South Omelette with chorizo, cheese, onions, and other veggies. It was huuuuuuuuuuuge and came with hash browns and an English muffin. The breakfast was larger than the breakfast I typically eat at home, but I snarfed this down with no problems or guilt. When something is this good, who can count calories, eh? US Egg also caters to gluten-sensitive and the requirements of gluten-free meals for customers. They have a fairly extensive gluten-free menu and they even made a fresh gluten-free hollandaise sauce for my wife and her omelette.  Also, the staff were very friendly and the vibe of US Egg is very much like a neighborhood restaurant where everyone knows your name and you always look forward to going there.   Overall, if you love breakfast and are in Scottsdale, I highly recommend US Egg. It's just good down home comfort breakfast food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday and our waitress was just as pleasant as the first.  Outstanding  customer service, great food, good times"}
{"text":"it is true that the protein pancakes here are good, but overall this is just an average, \"big box\" place for brunch.  nothing bad, just nothing especially good about it either."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I'm so happy they opened this location since it's closer to my house! Both locations on Osborn and Shea never disappoint! Always excellent food and excellent service. We come here all the time and I'm in love with their coffee and skillets.   Today was my Birthday and of course wanted to go to my ALL time FAVORITE breakfast spot, US EGG. Our server was wonderful, I think her last/first name was Galloway?  I told her it was my birthday so I was gonna order a mimosa with my coffee. I also decided to order something different today. I ordered off the secret menu and got their jalapeño scramble! So delicious and I loved the fresh jalapeños! It wasn't very spicy which was nice!!! Towards the end of the meal she brought me out a complimentary protein pancake for my Birthday! So amazing! I was so shocked and happy!   I truly am in love with this place! The best service I've ever had truly. I will continue to be a word of mouth for this establishment! Thank you always for the wonderful service and food!"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes were the best pancakes I've ever had. Went with the half and half and combined them with the veggie skillet. Great service and restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak is up there with the best of em!!! Service has always been great, smiling faces early in the morning is great to see. The food comes out quickly, and the prices are always good. It's definitely a go-to when we're hungry for good food."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to this location.  This one has been newly renovated and everything looks clean, pretty, and nice.  I usually get two eggs hashbrowns and toast but this time I wanted to try something different.  The amount of food you get for the price is amazing.  That's why I love coming here well and because I like the hashbrowns too.  But I always have leftovers to last me another meal or two.  I got some type of omelet which was really good.  Service was great as usual."}
{"text":"Coffee was terrible. Can't do eggs as ordered? Its an egg place, says so in the name! I would not go back, not with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Great establishment for breakfast or lunch.  Well managed with efficient and attentive wait staff.  Great egg dishes.  The Texas Omelet is beyond \"delish\"!!!"}
{"text":"So the two year anniversary coupon came in the mail.  We had to figure out our training schedule that would allow for us to grab a breakfast before work.  I have to tell you, what's stopping me from trying more items on the menu is clearly the fact that the protein pancakes are the bombdotcom.  Service was pretty solid and I was able to leave with a hot cup of coffee to go.  Will be back when I'm craving those pancakes again."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best breakfast pre-race, post-race and remembering I used to race place! We were in town for that Ironman and ate here no less than 3 times in about 5 days. Delicious and hearty breakfasts. The servers were all really fast and friendly and i even saw one of them volunteering on race day! I think my husband would consider this the best pancake he's put in his mouth. I think they were called Power Pancakes or something.  The eggs/omelets are also very tasty. The only downfall I see is that we don't have this place at home."}
{"text":"This place should be 4 1/2 stars.  Service very fast but sincere and patient.  The protein pancakes are as good of a pancake as there is.  It's a cakier pancake with blueberries and granola on wheat flour.  You can order the pancakes only, or you can upgrade your eggs and pancake special to include the protein pancake.   The eggs are perfectly cooked.  It's convenient to get to and it put a big smile on my face as even during lunch hours, it, thank god, serves breakfast.  The interior is a tan colored minimalist look but with an American theme that has this interesting blown up map of the United States.  Bathrooms are clean also.  The only thing that prevents this place from being five stars is that  the coffee isn't eye opening.  If they serve Starbucks Coffee or something stronger or comparable, there will be no better breakfast place than it.  But in this part of the US, the good American Breakfast joint is ubiquitous."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg is a great place for breakfast and the protein cake is notable.  The other dishes are good, too, but the protein cake can only be gotten at this restaurant (as far as I know).  It is just delicious!  Another thing to know about U.S. Egg - there is often a line outside the door but do not let that dissuade you - it moves quickly and you won't wait long.  And of course, it's worth it!  Plenty of parking, too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place and I'm happy that there is now a location on Shea Boulevard.    On Sundays, of course, there is a line but what I have always noticed about US Egg is that the line moves.  Plus, this place is large.  Last Sunday, we waited maybe 10 minutes - well worth it.  We come here for the protein cake because it is unique and delicious.  The other breakfast items are good; I have never had a bad meal at US Egg.  Food is quite plentiful, too, and you might end up taking some home.  You get a pitcher of water at your table and if you order coffee, you get a pitcher at your table.  That's so convenient.  There are so many great breakfast places in Scottsdale and this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a higher review but I just couldn't.   I was seated right away which was nice. My waitress was great. Everything was fine until I received my order. I had the protein pancakes that I've read so much about in the other reviews and they were really good. Problem was that as I was cutting into the pancake it was raw. I couldn't grab the attention of my waitress so I waved over another girl. I told her that it wasn't cooked all the way and asked if I could have another. She apologized and took my plate away. Before she left she turned to me and said \"So you want them cooked well done?\". I almost laughed but I saw that she was dead serious. With as straight of a face as possible I said \"yes please.\" What I wanted to say was that I wasn't aware that pancakes came any other way, but I don't think that would've gone over so well.   I would go back again but I would make sure to cut into the middle of the pancake first!"}
{"text":"Came here at 8:00 this morning with my son looking for a good hot breakfast experience. The restaurant was 1/3 full.  I ordered the chicken mushroom omelet with mushroom cream sauce, hash browns and an English Muffin. It arrived barely warm and upon complaining was brought a side of sauce.  I will not return...my omelet obviously.was either not fresh made or sat in the kitchen too long. Even the muffin had need pre toasted and served as if an afterthought. Hash browns were blah. Mashed inferior...barely crisped at all. My son had eggs over easy with a tiny grilled chicken breast and a side of spinach. Couldn't eat the unseasoned, lukewarm spinach, but his eggs and grill marked chicken were adequately hot. He commented that we might have faired better at Dennys...though we both avoid that alternative. If your looking for a good traditional breakfast, I'd recommend you avoid US Egg. I paid $27. 99 minus tip...water to drink which would be ok if food was hot and better prepared...it was not! Right now turned off of getting a breakfast experience for a while!  Wait staff barely made it to our table to leave bill...let alone ask how the food was."}
{"text":"What a rip off. If I had seen the Einstein's on the opposite corner before placing my to go order over the phone, I would have gone there. But being from out of town, I was at their mercy. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese bagel. It was for my son. He said it tasted like ass. To add insult to injury, it cost $10.50. I could've gotten the same at Einstein's for four dollars"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge pancake fan.  They have to be really good for me to eat them.  Today, I found a pancake I love!  The protein pancakes are great!  All U.S. Egg's pancakes are made with whole wheat but the protein pancakes also pack in granola and almond slivers.  It sounds too grainy but it's not.  They are SO wonderful.    I also love that they bring you a pitcher of iced water and a carafe of coffee.  I hate when waitresses refill my coffee to soon and mess up my \"blend\" of cream and sugar.  I also hate when I can't get anyone to fill my cup.  So, this was a nice perk (ha, pun intended).    This place has a great variety at reasonable prices.  I'll definitely come back here the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I want in on owning this US Egg in Scottsdale.  The volume they crank out is incredible.  We had a short wait then into the packed rest. and off to the races.  Nice that they give you a pot of coffee at the table so you can pour away.  I had the huevos rancheros-quite good- and my friends had a split meal with a small skillet and two pancakes.  We had just summitted Camelback Mountain so the food hit the spot.   The kitchen fired up the food quickly and service was quick as we needed to get going to a spring training game it all was perfecto!  Yes-how do I get a piece of the action?"}
{"text":"I love love love US Egg! Everything is delicious and the service is really quick most of the time. The Idaho skillets are amazing and the protein pancakes are a must-have. My friends and I call them \"crack\" pancakes because they are so addictive! My only complaint is that the mimosas have pulp in them, which I think is weird. But this is my absolute favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Us egg is a fantastic place to eat the people are great always great service and great food very  very clean and the management carmine is the best"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking space made me love this place even more. I tried protein pancake like anybody else. It was great. Nice servers, they gave us a pot of coffee and jar of water so that we don't have to get their attention to get refill ... and they serve alcohols which I didn't know!! Next time my breakfast will be with Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I loved the fact that this place has the option for protein powder in their pancakes! Also they were able to get us in despite the fact that they were packed on a Sunday. The staff was friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"Tried the protein pancakes and was not disappointed. Highly recommend the half and half - half protein pancakes, half egg scramble."}
{"text":"It's just a breakfast not too fancy. Weak coffee.... the one thing I'd like to recommend for this restaurant and all restaurant is bring the bill. there's nothing worse than having to sit and wait and wait and wait for them to bring your bill so that you can get back on the road never asked if I wanted more coffee breakfast was luke warm."}
{"text":"I come to U.S. Egg as often as I can! I meet friends for breakfast here every once in a while, but mostly I come here alone to read, drink coffee and have breakfast! They treat me so well every time I come in! I always get amazing and consistent service and my go to breakfast meal (the Half & Half, half Protein Pancakes and half Idaho Hot Skillet) never disappoints! I love everything about this spot and highly recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"Everything was bad. The service was TERRIBLE. I'm here for work so it was just me. The guy would not seat outside, but then right after he sat me at the first table next to the door I watched him seat a couple outside right away. My server was very nice at first and brought me a water and beverage. After she took my order, I never saw her again. Meanwhile, the Bloody Mary was so bad I had to dump so much hot sauce to even drink it. The only good thing was bacon. My food came fast but was awful. The hash browns are so mushy and disgusting they are almost watery. My eggs Benedict had literally one drop of hollandaise sauce. And it was terrible. The ham could not even be cut it was so bad. No one ever asked me how my food was once. My server never came back after taking my order. And don't call me \"sweetie\" to try to make up for it. Waste of time and money. WAAAAY overpriced."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place!  Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!   Even though I had a pretty plain item - pancakes, eggs, and potatoes, it was all very good.  Highly recommend the protein pancakes, which have oats and blueberries! They were super delicious, and had a nice, fluffy, texture.  Even though I was the only person who ordered ice tea, they brought a whole pitcher so I could refill at my every whim, which was often, because Arizona is friggin DRY and I wasn't used to it!  Minus one star because there's nothing extraordinary on the menu (no unique specials or anything), but everything was delciious."}
{"text":"Had family here for breakfast. Medium over eggs were all over cooked. The hash browns were soggy. 6 of us barely ate. Told waitress and was charged full price. Not happy with this place. Chef needs to know what over medium eggs are. And how hash browns should be cooked."}
{"text":"Breakfast here before a long drive from Scottsdale to Sacramento. Had the US Egg sandwich which was very good. Thick bacon and a lot of cheese. Very clean restaurant and restrooms. \"Sam\" our waitress was very good!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the Egg, I use to live next to the one on Baseline. Points for the waitress filling our coffee cup 3/4 full so we have room for cream. Negative points for giving us the check half way through our breakfast, I feel like your kicking us out.....I hate that.   The food is always great, I've never had a complaint the 100 times I've eaten at US Egg."}
{"text":"Everyone kept raving about how great this place is so I dragged a friend of mine out Sat am for breakfast with me. I've def had better. Food was ok but nothing special. The potatoes could have used to been cooked a bit longer so they were a little crispier. But honestly, same thing different place. Nothing really stood out as better to me than the next place.   I felt like the place was crowded too. The seating that is. Not just because of all the people in there. Ample parking, average prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This was the first time my Wife & I ate at this restaurant. The food was great, the staff was very friendly, and the environment was inviting. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The service is quick and friendly, exactly what you'd expect from a no-frills breakfast place. Funny thing about US Egg is I'm definitely a fan although I absolutely hate eggs.  During my last visit I was served by Erica, she was friendly and pleasant. My meal came out cooked perfectly and it was really good. I had corned beef and hash, with hash browns, bacon and sourdough toast. I rarely finish a big breakfast but I ate every bit of this. You really can't beat a classic restaurant place. No major complaints about this location, it's very lively and clean.   One thing I will say is a bummer is not being able to substitute for the eggs on the corned beef and hash meal, it increased my ticket $5 not being able to do that. Other than that it's good."}
{"text":"Took my buddy here the other day to nurse a hangover. Great food. Reasonably priced. Definitely did the job for us. They are open til 2pm serving breakfast. Friendly staff. They brought us pitchers of our drinks so we didn't have to chase a waitress down everytime we wanted a refill. I like that."}
{"text":"All good. Seated right away, ordered right away, food came out in a timely manner. Manager came up to table to greet us."}
{"text":"Just went today and had a good experience.  They leave the coffee pot on the table for you to refill as you desire.  Had blueberry pancakes and bacon, onion and pepper skillet.  Very good and not too heavy.  Coffee is good as well.  Server was very good as she was always around to make sure things were fine."}
{"text":"It's packing but you can still get in quickly which is a good thing if there are 6 of you and you are hungry.  Pretty standard fare but it is reasonably priced and they get it to the table pretty darn quick.  Will say they do make some significantly large enough pancakes.  I suggest the blueberry ones - YUM!  And they will keep the juices, water, and coffee coming as long as you want them.  Even though we like trying new places to eat when we travel we seem to gravitate to this place each time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Half and half was great. You get protein pancakes and choice of skillet. I had the chicken avocado skillet. Portion was just right. Both pancakes and skillet were great."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast and blazing fast service. Had quite a nice omelet this morning. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could but it wasn't quite up to 4 stars. Typical Az coffee ( which usually sucks) but a nice omelet and the fruit was fresh."}
{"text":"Very good service bumps this breakfast spot ahead of the new Paradise Bakery. The menu could use a refresh and I'd love to see some healthy omelettes. It seems every time I have come here, they are really friendly, and differentiate based on service.  Free wifi is a big plus! I have never tried the lunch as breakfast continues to be really great."}
{"text":"We went here from a suggestion from family. They are known for their protein pancakes and although I am not a big pancake fan I thought I should try them. They have what they call half half. This allows you to get a smaller portion of pancakes and their skillet of your choice. That was the perfect meal, I was able to try the pancakes and get the eggs, hash browns and fixings as well. The pancakes are really good and are definitely highly recommended. I really enjoyed them and of course my skillet was just as tasty. I got the bacon, onion and pepper skillet that comes mixed with hash browns and topped with an egg( cooked your way). We thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely return. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Really good BASIC food. If you're a true \"foodie\" or looking for more of a trendy breakfast/brunch spot this is definitely not it. However it's good for kids and if you're in a hurry. Service was great, food came out very fast and portions were huge. Overall nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Met Alice Cooper here once.  Eat the crunchy granola pancakes.  Do not get two, you only need one.  One is bigger than your head.  Coffee is bottomless.  Not the best coffee I've had, but good for an egg joint.  For Scottsdale it's not an uppity place..just what you need for breakfast.  Fast, in and out in about 15 minutes and under $15."}
{"text":"I have ate here many times, and had the chance to eat here again this past February. I went with the protein pancakes again. Still as good as I remember. The place wasn't as busy as I remember it was and they really need to do something about the fruit fly's, they were annoying. All in all, good food."}
{"text":"I have tried several locations and always get sub par food quality.  Temperature and Accuracy were off today.  I ordered the Triple play combo with protein pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon.  I got two plates of cold food and sausage instead of bacon.  I let the server know about the bacon before trying the food she applogised and said she would get me bacon.  When she returned she let me know she wrote down sausage and I said I ordered bacon and my food is cold.  Her tone changed a little after that and brought me some fresh fruit while I wait for meal to be re-cooked.  It was much better, but wow what a lousy start.  The prices are too high to eat just so so food and have servers tell you you ordered something you didn't."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast this morning after having done the Princess Christmas festivities last night. The food was good, the service was good and fast despite being busy and Christmas Eve. There was no wait, we got there just in time. The only reason I give 4 stars is that the waitress (who otherwise was fabulous and friendly) kept putting things on the table in front of my toddler within his reach. If you've got little people in your party, you understand. That would be my only feedback."}
{"text":"The first time at this location. Came here after a charity walk that was close by. Service was good, but more than one person including me out of the party of seven said the food was bland.   I had the meat lover skillet which was a good portion but the hash was not cooked long enough to be crispy. The gravy with chicken fried steak had no taste other than salt.   Service was good enough to merit another chance here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about living in Scottsdale is all the breakfast options. Does any city love breakfast more than Scottsdale? US Egg is one of many entries on the scene and it is a good one. The best? No, but it is a reliable spot that i can count on. My fav order is the Eggs Benedict. Theis location always seems to be busy and have a vibrant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not bad! The service was fantastic, and it's a light, airy, nice space to eat a meal in. I enjoyed the ambience and the branding is well done.  The food was pretty good and they give you plenty of it. The waitress was very careful to take note of my nut allergy and check with the kitchen on my order and have it cooked on a separate griddle from where the protein pancakes are cooked (they contain tree nuts). The pancakes were huge and pretty tasty.   Everyone was happy with their food. I think we'd come here again. It's not the most gourmet breakfast in the world but it's good. Coffee was pretty bad, sadly.  I'd like to try a scramble next time. They sounded pretty great."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place when I come to Az.  Their omelets are amazing and yesterday I had their protein blueberry  pancakes so very  yummy.   My better half had the chicken fried steak he lived it. Also the bloody marys are bomb they have bacon and pickles.  Service is 5 star! Best breakfast place around"}
{"text":"Love US Egg.  One of my favorite restaurants.  No matter how busy they always seem to find a place to sit.  I always get the same thing and I love it.  I order the Santa Fe half and half with protien pancakes.  The quality is great and so is the service.  Its the first place we go when we get to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We ended up at US Egg only after making several wrong turns en route from the hotel to another breakfast spot.  As usual, my blunder turned into a fantastic surprise.   US Egg served up super fresh food, great decor and very friendly service.  I had the pancakes, eggs and bacon. The pancakes are made with wheat flour, which gave them a deliciously natural flavor and texture.  My meal also included four sizable bacon strips...most places skimp by giving you three thin pieces.  The coffee also hit the spot (before leaving, the waitress offered a go cup).  Another small yet memorable touch.   Too bad we ate at US Egg on the last day of our trip...I would've eaten there every morning!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! When you walk in the place is one big room. Booths separate the center of the room with tables all around. We were there for late breakfast so it was not crowded at all. Service was quick, attentive and courteous. I was most impressed with the fresh fruit. Most places cut fruit early so some dry out of get slimy. This fruit was none of those thing! It was on the cheap side even though we ate healthy. Great decor inside! Will def come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast.  Everything I have ever ordered has been good.  I normally stick to my Eggs Benedict (I get the California style w/ avocado and tomato) and call it good.  But here I have tried the breakfast burrito, the whole wheat pancakes, the protein pancakes, the huevos rancheros, the veggie omlette, chocolate chip pancakes, and it was all good!  Yeserday I saw they have a pumpkin pancake, I think I'll wait for the holiday spirit to hit me before I try that one, but I'm sure it will be awsome.  If I had to gripe, I wish they had a bar for mimosa's and Bloody Mary's, but I should probably cut down on my morning drinking anyway."}
{"text":"We came into this location after a bad experience at a different restaurant. We were seated quickly and our server Crystal was awesome. She was very attentive to our toddler and brought him crackers to satisfy him until our food came. Our food was on point as always. We love the protein pancakes! Thank you US Egg for another great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"The most friendly service, beautiful waitresses, and the food was amazing. We were in n out in less then 30 min! Prompt to service. Food was made fast and tasted delicious. I got the hawk-eye egg white omelet and it was very filling! My buddy's got the skillet and they couldn't even finish it! Everything amazing and tasty. WILL come back when i am back in Arizona."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. Outdoor seating is tough for them based on the location. Indoor has a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been loyal US Egg fans since we started coming to Spring Training in 2014. Unfortunately, our experience yesterday at this location was one that had us seeking a new breakfast place. Service was great as usual, but all of the food in our party of 5 people was cold. I, personally, didn't say anything because I thought maybe it was just mine. After we left and got to talking, we all said the same thing.....food was cold (not just lukewarm, but cold).  Again, unfortunate because we've always enjoyed coming here and raved (and recommended) it to others."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and sub-par food quality.  I'd rather make my own breakfast than go here.  If you're committed to having someone else scramble your eggs go to a nicer place that focuses more on quality rather than quantity...seriously this place is huge and you won't really enjoy yourself.  I know I didn't.  There are plenty of other places to go in the immediate area...I just really don't think this place is getting into a car and driving for."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick breakfast. When you are on a timeline, have a large group, and just want a consistent, fast, clean place to eat - this is the spot.  I have been to their location in Old Town Scottsdale many times and am glad that a new location opened in my area.  This location is pretty much the same as the other--same menu, large open dining area, lots of noise and people bustling in and out.  I will admit that the food isn't noteworthy - that's not to say it's bad, just nothing fancy or special.  But the prices are really good! If you are in the mood for something a bit more upscale or alternative, there are plenty of other places... U.S. Egg is more of a classic diner experience.    Side notes: Their staff are always on the ball and pleasant. Also like the other location- parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"It was very crowded for Father's Day!...but that is to be expected and is a positive showing for the business!!  As busy as it was, I was seated within 20 minutes and the service was prompt!...  I wanted to order eggs benedict but I have to confess that I used the photos and comments in YELP to show the waitress that some people complained that the eggs were overcooked...and I soooooooo wanted good-soft-and runny eggs in my benedict....she was right on top of it and it turned out PERFECT!...Yummmmmmmm.  The juice was fresh squeezed O.J. And the coffee was very tasty, not like it was overdone or old...  I give them four stars because there is no readily available bike rack outside....and this was my 1st time here on a holiday...so I need to wait until I come back and see if they are consistent.  PS...Great menu selections too!  Out."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast choice in Scottsdale. Service was good, food was tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The best place to eat breakfast a have had period. Try the protein pancakes. Great serves too. We go here every time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really solid breakfast food, perfect for the morning after a fun night. Hearty fare and fresh ingredients, served efficiently with a smile. Lots of standard choices, prepared well.  From the moment you walk in the door, it's pleasant, efficient service. The place is huge, so I've never had to wait long and it was great whether there were two or six in my party."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to U.S. Egg this morning after reading online that they served gluten-free toast from a gluten-free toaster.  As a celiac sufferer I get excited about little things like being able to eat toast in restaurants!    This place is a gem, and not only for people who have to eat gluten-free.  The interior is clean and bright and cheerful, and the staff could not be more friendly or efficient.  Ashley waited on us and she was a peach!  We both had omelettes, which were fluffy and delicious, with tasty fillings.  I can always tell a good omelette when the cook takes the time to saute and soften the vegetables before filling the omelette.  The hash browns were wonderful and crispy without the slightest bit of grease, and, of course, the toast was great.    I almost forgot to mention, but the coffee was excellent.  All in all, it was a great experience and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I tried this place per request from my friend. I think I need some new friends. This place is nothing special. The ambiance feels akin to an IHOP and although the portions are large for a reasonable price, the quality is par at best. Our hash browns were undercooked when they arrived at our table and were undercooked when they came back a second time. The omelet was good but not spectacular. I had the chicken bacon avocado omelet and the bacon and or chicken was rubbery at times, This is not a sensation I enjoy when eating eggs. The ceiling was also dripping water on my date which is rarely a fun time. I will say that there are a lot of choices of omelets and our server was extremely sweet and attentive to our table.  Other than that it would be a stretch for me to recommend this place to someone I like."}
{"text":"Great choice of menu, Gluten free toast, fresh Fruit Juice, friendly staff, nice decor, good location....and cheap.  Great place for breakfast !!!!    Will go back"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at this location but my 5 star review goes out to the guy who performs with the \"US Egg sign\" at the corner of Shea & Scottsdale! Very talented young man who knows how to turn & toss the sign with an intense passion and always a smile on his face.  Every time I drive by that intersection and watch him I am very entertained and I always think that if I go out for breakfast or lunch I should go to this US Egg place."}
{"text":"Saw it restaurant wild looking for another one went here instead and had a very very good breakfast the people here were very polite and nice and very helpful"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Had the chili omelette, was amazing. So were the potatoes. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in while driving through town. The 4 star rating is wrong.... Service was excellent, biscuits and gravy...and toast were good but overall the meal wasn't worth 4 stars. Greasy sausage and the hash browns were dry, powdery, and flavorless."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. They always make my food healthy just like I asked them to do. They're inviting. Right when I walk in they everything they can to get me in right away. Their menu is nice and big and has a lot of options"}
{"text":"Jumbo!  Portion sizes on these dishes will fill up your inner hungry-man. This was my first time stopping in as I wanted to grab a 12 lunch. Breakfast is always preferred so I opted for the \"New Yorker\" Omelet and added a pancake side.  Everything was Ok, but having frozen fruit cover your pancake is always a real buzz kill for me.   The coffee was Ok... nothing to jump about.  Service girls were pleasant and the entire place was clean and bright."}
{"text":"In my one visit here, I wasn't too impressed. My 'omelette' was really a large folded egg batter with the ingredients placed between the fold, rather than mixed-in to the batter. This made it hard to eat, especially since the egg was dry. The steamed spinach on the side was good, until it got cold and soggy. The waitresses were very helpful and attentive  The price was too high, I can go to a better restaurant up Scottsdale road for a better meal at a cheaper price"}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday and was very underwhelmed. We arrived around noon, so I got a bacon cheeseburger, while my family ordered breakfast foods. The waitresses were friendly, but moved as slow as glaciers. My burger was decent enough, and my family enjoyed their food as well. The parking situation was bad, and with the new apartments being erected next door, it looks like US Egg has to share their garage in order to fit customers. Kinda weird, but a nice option to be able to get your car out of the million degree sun, even if you have to walk a bit in return. The biggest complaint came from a stereotypical Californian couple (he was wearing a Giants hat) sitting close to us. Half way through our lunch the guy decided to put on some Rihanna (or other hideous pop music) at full volume on his phone so the whole outdoor patio could hear it. Naturally his ditzy girlfriend had to talk even LOUDER (if that was at all possible) over his teenie bopper music. I even caught the guy dancing a bit and singing along to the music, with his leg literally draped over the armrest on his chair. Class act. No one from the restaurant asked him to turn it off, despite the dirty looks these two were getting from other customers. And in case you're wondering, the guy couldn't sing. He should stick to his day job, whatever that may be."}
{"text":"The \"Protein Pancakes\" are always a treat, but the \"California Eggs Benedict\" was just awful today.  The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though.  They tasted like shredded cardboard.  I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results.  Shame on you US Egg!"}
{"text":"No fuss breakfast, roomy and spacious. Good service. Coffee, eggs, bacon..."}
{"text":"Been to the Egg countless times.  It is consistently good. I must add that my review is based solely on breakfast food as i've never ventured to the lunch side of the menu. I love those protein pancakes and have yet to meet a person who didn't thoroughly enjoy them. Since i am a fan of savory foods at breakfast, lately i get the Half & Half. This way i get 2 good-sized protein pancakes and half of a scramble. The sausage & bacon scramble is good as well as the chicken & avocado scramble. Their breakfast potatoes are yummy, i like mine with syrup! Its great hangover food and you can usually get a table within about 10 minutes. The service is consistently good here and food is out so quick, which is prob why the wait times are low. It does get busy on wknds after 10am, so be prepared for crowds waiting."}
{"text":"Just finished a great breakfast at U.S. Egg. I had the garden omelet and my husband had the protein pancakes. Both were perfectly cooked and taste great. But, the thing that impressed me most about this place was the service. While we were only there about 45 minutes our waitress checked on us about six or seven times. I can't believe I already forgot her name (I think it was Karena). Besides our waitress, the hostess also stopped by the table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Sure, it wasn't a Saturday or Sunday morning, but I consider that to be exceptional service by any standards."}
{"text":"I came in hangry and definitely got served a great egg sandwich to satisfy my mood...lol. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the Mushroom Swiss Angus Burger.  Decent.  It came with a salad.  Decent as well."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is Amazing! The omelettes are STUFFED with whatever you order. I was so pleased at how great the service was. Very accommodating and the waitress Sanders she was on top of our order. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 15 years and the food is better and better every time. I was so lucky. The restaurant opened up after hours to host my rehearsal dinner for my wedding. They customized menus and even had gluten free selections for me. We really wanted breakfast under the stars and the whole crew made that possible. The food was amazing. The service was impeccable. The care and concern everyone put forth will be treasured. We were so pleased with everything that we returned to the US Egg on Wednesday for breakfast (Tempe Location). No matter what location you are at, you will have a great meal, service and experience. I highly recommend US Egg. You can't go wrong with the protein cakes, skillets, and more. Thanks Gebran for amazing me! We are so fortunate you agreed to do so much for us. May your kindness be returned 10 fold."}
{"text":"We have been going there for almost 10 years now.  It is our number one favorite place for brunch after church on Sundays.  In all the times we have been there we have never been disappointed with the food, and every server we have experienced is always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  You must have a great orientation program.  I also should say, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have been going to this US Egg location for about 6 years and usually it's the best.  However, today we had one of the worst dining experiences imaginable.  The worst thing about it was the way the management chose to handle it.  Here's a snapshot: --Party of 4:  2 adults + 2 toddlers.  We were shown to our table immediately. --About 15-20 minutes went by without anyone stopping at our table to even address us. --Finally our order was taken - we ordered two kids breakfasts and two standard items off the menu. --35 minutes later our food had still not arrived.  During that time, our server never once stopped by, checked to see if we needed refills, or indicated anything unusual about our order. --My wife walked up to the host stand to check on the status that was followed by no updates. --Still nobody came over to our table until finally our food arrived - 40 minutes after we ordered it (and a full hour after we sat down at the table with two toddlers). --One of our kid's meals was missing - the server never even placed the order to begin with. --Server started making excuses about how busy they were.  However, we regularly go to this locations on Sunday mornings and they are typically far busier - even with a wait to get a table - and we never have to wait that long for our food. --We explained that we come often and that it never takes this long - and she then challenged us by snootily asking \"do you ever come on Sundays?\"  To which we responded yes - all the time.  Then she became even more argumentative and said \"Well, have you come during Spring Training?\"  Of course we have.  And we've been there when it's far busier than it was today and it's never taken this long. --Finally, after arguing with us, we just demanded that she go and get our son's meal since it was clearly missing (and you can only imagine how much fun it is to be with a toddler who's been waiting an hour for food only to see that the rest of his family has something to eat but he still has to wait). --Even before our son's food arrived, my wife cut into her pancake only to find a nasty, slimy brown hair on her plate underneath it. --The food runner finally brought our son's food and at that point we pointed out the hair on the other plate.  She took it away and said she'd bring back a fresh one. --At no point did our server ever come back to apologize for the hair in the food, for forgetting one of our four orders, or for taking so long for the order. --Furthermore, our drinks were never even refilled the entire hour+ we were at our table. --In the end, they took both kids meals off the bill which surprised us that they didn't offer more consideration for the hairy pancakes.  At that point we were very frustrated and in disbelief about the whole thing.  When she told us about taking off the kids meals, I commented that I was surprised they still wanted to charge us for anything given the hair and the wait.  She rudely snapped \"If you are eating it, you are paying for it.\"  We finally left, made a comment to the manager at the front that it was a terrible experience, and he just shrugged and said \"I heard about it.\"  Clearly he didn't care.  Honestly, if they had just provided the slightest bit of remorse or expressed even a hint of an apology it would have been different.  However, instead the server and management were aloof and certainly didn't prioritize customer service over their desire to charge us.  Of course, we paid our bill as always.  However, if they had simply apologized and taken off my wife's hairy pancakes I would not have felt compelled to post this Yelp review."}
{"text":"Love going to US Egg for a yummy breakfast during the weekends. Be prepared as you will most likely have a wait of 15 to 20 minutes. There were 3 of us in our party and we waiting maybe 15 minutes and it was about 11am on a Sunday. We got seated inside and our server came over (she was great). I had the Eggs Benedict, my boyfriend had the 1/2 and 1/2 skillet and protein pancakes and our friend had the spinach and mushroom omelet. Everything came out perfectly and without a long wait for food. I have been to several other nearby breakfast spots and no one can seem to poach an egg propertly but not US Egg! They get it right every time!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast. This is a family owned business with a great business model. Great service, great food, immaculate restaurant. We were in town from Las Vegas and found this place on Yelp. The food was good and plentiful, it came out quickly. They give you a carafe of coffee so you aren't looking for your waitress to refill your cup. In spite of being super busy on a Saturday morning, we had our food in 10 minutes or less. What a surprise. I give them 5 thumbs up"}
{"text":"this was our first breakfast hit-up since we moved back, and gotta say it again....the protein pancakes are still da bomb. so lucious, cruchy yet soft, sweet yet salty, healthy but so much syrup...mmmm! go at an off time or you'll be knocking elbows with the elderly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and couldn't decide between the corned beef hash or Denver omelette, went with the Dever and wasn't disappointed, food came out hot and fast, lots of ham which was good and a good portion of hash browns. They dropped off a pot of coffee with the meal so never needed to ask for a refill. Waitress was nice and attentive which made for a positive dining experience"}
{"text":"We like this place based on their Protein Pancake. Not sure how good it is for you but it taste good! The servers are super friendly. The only knock is the coffee. It's terrible. I can only give it 3 stars. Please switch to Starbucks or another premium brand as I can't drink it."}
{"text":"Good Food, price, and excellent service I took one star off because the restroom was not kept clean and with paper......I understand it was packed but stilll....I did teell the girl up in the counter and she immediately took care of the restroom.....I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"The food was delicious,  nice environment and right across from the hotel I was staying at.  The protein pancakes were amazing, never had then you didn't even need syrup. Their skillets ere also yummy the meat lovers one was spectacular.  Wish they were open for dinner I would come again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but service is mediocre. But it's a great place! Go try it out!! Their skillets are all so good!"}
{"text":"US egg is cute, it reminds me of the smaller breakfast diners but it's so big Today, Sunday, it is very busy but there was a 10 min wait... Not long... They put complimentary coffee outside as well as water Inside is very huge and open so it's a little loud but I enjoy it...  Makes it feel more like breakfast  Our server, Whitney, is super nice and knowledgable of the menu I wasn't quite sure of what to get as they have a big menu as well Big place-Big menu, go figure ;) I asked for her recommendations and she was very helpful I ended up getting the decaf coffee  And The chicken fried steak with eggs  Very good portion  The eggs are good, over easy The hash browns are a little dry and plain so I added pepper and ketchup The chicken fried steak has good flavor and the gravy does too  Good first experience"}
{"text":"My mom is in town for Christmas and this is her favorite place for breakfast.  She loves the protein pancakes.  Service here is always great, food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I always find something that is healthy and tasty!  The protein pancakes are the best."}
{"text":"Very consistent solid diner food with friendly service.  Owners seem to be on site a lot and treat employees well. Could use a little more originality on menu"}
{"text":"Ordered an Iron Skillet- chicken, bacon, avocado and tomatoes served on hash browns. Cones with an English muffin and two eggs any style. VERY good and filling!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5, Service: 3.5, Atmosphere: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (most special breakfast items like benedits or half and half $12) Opentableable: no, kid's menu: yes (with coloring) Return worthiness: sure  Highlights: - Large menu: from omelettes to pancakes, skillets and lunch sandwiches, there a great variety. Portions were large too. - Decor: diner style with cool art pieces. Many egg cartons painted to look like the American flag (also a Pokestop). Also a big US map on one wall with pictures of iconic items from that state.  - Skillets: liked my chicken, chorizo, and green chile one. Loved mixing a sunnyside up egg with the hash browns and proteins. Hub got the insane meat lovers one which had chicken fried steak, sausage, ham, and bacon covered with white gravy. 4 stars  - Eggs benedict: looked a bit sad and hollandaise was borderline neon but taste was on point. 3.5 stars  - Pitcher of water: maybe they're used to dehydrated people in the desert but leaving one for us was greatly appreciated   Midlights: - Protein pancake: they're famous for this yet I didn't quite enjoy the granola nestled in the batter--it isn't as appealing lacking crunch. 3 stars  Lowlights: - Didn't realize they had a variety of mimosas until I saw the tent towards the end of our meal.  Solid casual place I'd come back to."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great, prices reasonable.  Service on the other hand is horrible.  Last time I ate there, the food came out cold and when brought to the attention of the waitperson, who by the way couln't be found for 15 minutes, she gave us the dear in headlights look and said \"sorry\".  That was it.  Highly suggest this restaurant get back to basics, because it seems to start at the hop.  The manager is just as bad."}
{"text":"Was in town for some spring training games and tired of the crappy hotel breakfast. Looked this place up and boy am I glad I did. Food was excellent. Had an omelette that was amazing. And they leave you a thermal pot of coffee so you don't have to depend on staff to keep it full. My wife was very pleased with her breakfast as well. She talked about the pancakes all day. We highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place around for a big breakfast. The Jack and Avocado omelet was excellent and it came with a huge portion of hash browns and English muffin. Service was perfect and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Gross... overpriced breakfast. $27 for two people! Nothing tasted very good. My omelette was super dry. My husband got a bonus egg shell in his salad. A manager was supposed to come talk to us about it... Never saw them. It was removed from the bill so it would have been over $30 for gross breakfast. It took a long time to get our good too.  Host was unfriendly. Waitress was sweet."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Sunday for breakfast and found the meal to be pretty good. I had the chili omelette, which came with potatoes and an english muffin. The whole dish was very good, and would return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good , service was great there were 14 of us with kids and our waitress was very patient. She had another waitress coming by too to help they were great on service ..food was extremely better than ihop or Denny's . I had chicken fried steak n eggs n it was delish it's great for breakfast for out of towners like us!"}
{"text":"Spinach florentine omelet w hash browns and english muffin. Tasty but portion very large. Didn't think to look for senior menu. Maybe next time. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Overpriced eggs. The presentation and service was great but it wasn't equally as great. The food was bland but then again it's about eggs. I prefer a little greasy spoon and this place is more like a Starbucks then a diner."}
{"text":"oh man, that protein pancake is ah-mazing...i am not huge on pancakes in general, nor sweet items for breakfast, but this dish I would gladly order again and again.  it's perfectly balanced and delicious.  the group shared a protein pancake bc apparently we haven't lived if we do not know it's greatness...SO glad we got one.  in addition to trying the pancake, we all ordered regular/traditional breakfast food.  i had the california benedict, and it was pretty average/standard.    definitely give the protein pancake a whirl if you're curious... i am going to attempt to recreate those pancakes for sure.  fellow Yelpers, any tips/recipes are welcome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service and great food. I recommend the protein pancakes and the bacon, onion, and pepper Idaho skillet. Christine & Heather are great servers. I will defiantly become a regular costumer."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg has been a family favorite for years (Tempe location).  It isn't somewhere to go for a gourmet meal, but for high quality American breakfast food, it's a winner.  The wait staff is always great about substitutions, the guys (owners) at the front are charming and the food comes out quickly.  I am an egg white omelet girl, but my parents love the protein pancakes that are full of granola and blueberries."}
{"text":"The best way I could describe my breakfast would be very, very OK.  I had the eggs, hash browns, bacon and English muffin.  The bacon was pretty good although it could have been cooked for just a couple minutes longer.  The hash browns for the most part were mushy and didn't really have cooked edges.  The eggs were....strange?  I've never had scrambled eggs that tasted like that.  I can't explain it, they tasted almost fake?  Like they were powdered and came from a box or something.  I couldn't finish them they just tasted off.  Kind of unfortunate for a place called the US Egg.  The English muffin was by far my favorite part so that's saying something.  My boyfriend did order the blueberry protein pancakes and yes, they are amazing.  Would definitely come back for them."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The service is always good, the menu has standard and adventurous items and they don't judge you if you're clearly hung over. I'd recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I've always had good service here, unlike the Tempe location. I've never had to wait and the food is always fresh and yummy. Also... totally saw Dan Majerle waiting for a table there once."}
{"text":"Wow... time flies when you're having fun.  I just realized I haven't updated my review for U.S. Egg in over two years, so the below is long overdue.  And just because I'm feeling creative today, here's a little something I wrote in honor of U.S. Egg:  U - ultimate place to go for a delicious breakfast S - super friendly staff  E - eggs, pancakes, waffles, and so much more! G - giant portions G - grateful... that's how I feel about having this place so close to home!  I was reminded of how much I enjoy this place after our delightful breakfast this morning.  There was a less than five minute wait to sit down, but the hostess brought me an OJ while I waited which made me very happy!  Once seated, our waitress came over to help us navigate the menu... it had been awhile since our last visit.  Per her recommendation, I went with a half order of the blueberry whole wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites.  A half order is plenty for one person fyi - it comes with a pancake as big as your plate!  It was delicious! J had coffee and a 2 egg breakfast with english muffin and hashbrowns.   I love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee at your table... and fyi this place has plenty of lunch options as well.  If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good, head over to U.S. Egg... I have to remember to do so more often!"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs Benedict. Did not have a pleasant first experience but manager George made it right and invited us back to give it another chance! I really appreciate his time and effort to better our experience."}
{"text":"Our recent visit to the U.S. Egg Company was very disappointing.  We were seated, and proceeded to order coffee and orange juice. Our server, who seemed more interested in getting us in and out, rushed through things and forgot that we wanted to dine in the restaurant instead of having our order put in to-go boxes.  We informed her that we wanted to eat there, and after a long wait had to leave due to another appointment. We weren't even given the opportunity to complain to an actual manager! Instead, we were treated to another senior waitress who gave us undeserved attitude. We promptly left and most likely will not return. There are plenty of breakfast places around Old-Town Scottsdale to choose from, I'd avoid this one."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me and my family. Always good food, good service and fast service. I tell my friends all the time why waste your time with all the expensive trendy places in o town were you get a hung over party girl as your server! The absolute best! Oh and very clean too!"}
{"text":"Place is a must try for breakfast. Much better than your ordinary Dennys or IHop. Food is so fresh and flavorful"}
{"text":"Place is huge! Food came out within 5 minutes! Huge portions ! Service was great, bunch of young hot girls. Would def recommend! But I'm still on team \"Eggstasy\". :)"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. The food was plentiful and everything was absolutely delicious. Everything on my plate was well cooked. Staff was nice and attentive. Would go back anytime. Recommend."}
{"text":"After NYE hungover breakfast....PERFECT! Lots of food, good service, value in pricing. Had the 1/2 meat skillet with protein pancakes...SOLID!"}
{"text":"I had driven by here a few times and notices the sign and the reviews when checking it out on yelp, so when I happened to be in the area, during their business hours, and hadnt had breakfast, the serendipity angels smiled upon me.   Short wait, but packed (good sign).  Great service, cute waitresses, nice menu offering.  Then got the food - eggs overcooked, bacon, sausage.  Kind of was looking for \"better than Denny's\" but got \"kinda worse than.\". Maybe the natives are missing a \"flavor gene\" or something.  Just \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Nice clean and bright space, staff polite and friendly. Menu had a lot of choice I had the Border chorizo over omelette with tortilla tasty but could of been heated better was only warm, wifey had the cornbeef  skillet nothing special but served well. Tea pot and coffee pot on your table our highlight......"}
{"text":"The protein pancake was good as were the scrambled eggs. The hash browns were not cooked enough. The coffee was okay. Overall, I would say a good place for breakfast but not great."}
{"text":"Food here is less than mediocre..    My guess is that people come here just to get some food in their stomach.  Obviously it can't be for taste or the quality of the food.  The best part of breakfast was the coffee which was nice and strong.  My scrambled eggs were pretty bad and you can tell it was made from the carton stuff.  And the bacon??  It was cooked beyond recognition and broke into little pieces when I attempted to eat it.  No kidding..  The sausages were just OK, nothing spectacular.    Like I said, the coffee was good but it doesn't make up for the tasteless food and the STEEP prices.  I think we spent close to $25 for breakfast and the whole time I kept thinking we should have gone to Denny's across the street."}
{"text":"I'm back in Scottsdale and had some time for breakfast and thought I'd stop in. The wait staff was great my server was incredibly helpful and attentive. I ordered scrambled eggs, English Muffin, hash browns extra crispy with bacon - $9 and change. All o can say was it was fine... You're  US Eggs it should be more than fine! It should be awesome the best... I may give it one more shot- next time i'll go to the Denny across the street were I can get a fine breakfast."}
{"text":"Second US Egg I've been to and I like this one better. Great staff--friendly, efficient and even the manager checked in to see how things were. Offer of to go cups for water and coffee at end was also nice. Clearly a well managed place!  Food came out quickly--Half & Half--2 blueberry & granola filled whole wheat pancakes & huuuuge half order of meat lovers skillet. Delicious and taking half home for breakfast tomorrow!  Coffe thermos and water jug at table a nice touch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good omelet. Very large portions and a great wait staff. The prices are good for as much food that you get. They also lease a pitcher of water or coffee so you can refill your own drinks. I think this is a nice touch. Location is really easy to get to."}
{"text":"Did the doordash with US Egg.  Delivery occurred 15 minutes early, portions were huge, and the food was great."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I noticed the line-up on for the restaurant. The wait time was less than expected though for a Sunday brunch. The restaurant was very busy and waitresses were rushing food but the service and attentiveness of my waitress was very good. I ordered vegetarian omelette with salsa on the side and toast instead of english muffin. The food was not bad but not as flavorful as I expected. I also liked the salsa. I'd recommend if you want to eat healthy, ask to not add melted cheese on top of the omelette."}
{"text":"Expensive for breakfast but worth it. Friendly cute staff, plenty of creative menu items and free wifi. The protein pancakes are gonna make you smile and if you are trying to hydrate this is your place. They serve every table with an iced and lemoned pitcher of aqua. The mural of America was fun to study."}
{"text":"I've been to this U.S. Egg three or four times. The service is good, the food quality good, and the portions adequate, but I find the prices a little high. $9 for one egg/sausage sandwich with a small bowl of cottage cheese is pricey. The same price for a fruit plate, but they bring you half a melon (you cut it yourself). I'd rather half half the food they put on my plate for half the price. You can't take home and reheat eggs so it's stuff it all in or waste it.  The wait line can be unbearably long on weekend mornings. So long that one time we walked across the street to Denny's instead of waiting in line at U.S. Egg.  But, I'll have to say that this is one of my  first choices of sit down and wait to be served places to have brunch so I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been visiting the South Scottsdale location for years. The french toast is incredible and the best thing on the menu in my opinion.  The pancakes are also delicious and huge! The service at this location was just average. The server seemed overwhelmed. She was very nice though. The cheese omelette was not hot; the cheese was not even melted. The coffee is just average. I'd go again but stick to the french toas and OJ."}
{"text":"When I'm in Scottsdale in the mornings this is my favorite place to grab a great breakfast. They serve breakfast and lunch until 2:30PM daily, I love breakfast so I haven't ventured over to the lunch menu yet.   They have everything you would expect for breakfast or lunch. Service is great and food comes out fast.   My favorite thing is the Hawkeye omelette. Chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and jack cheese. Amazing!  The omelettes are huge so be hungry!   Weekdays you can usually get seated right away at any hour. Weekends are packed though so expect a wait.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I debated on a 5 vs a 4 for this place. To be honest though, everything pointed to a 5, I was just bitter that I had to wait for my breakfast after everyone else was eating. But, they did smooth it all over and I was a happy camper once it came.   This place became our breakfast of choice based on proximity to the ballpark and great yelp reviews. Some friends joined us for breakfast, coming all the way from Surprise. We just ventured on down from North Scottsdale. This place did have that chain breakfast feel to it, but the menu seemed to set it apart from the rest.  It was a Sunday morning, and as expected, there was a wait. We had a larger than average party, with 7. The weather was not bad, so we waited out front and just chatted. The wait was about 30 minutes and we ended up being seated on the patio. I think we would have preferred inside, but there were heaters and it ended up being just fine.   Our orders varied from egg dishes to protein pancakes, biscuts and gravy to a side of eggs. Overall everyone was very happy. The biscuits and gravy folks were quite happy. The best option price wise on that actually seemed to be a side of biscuits and gravy. It was only one biscuit but it was inexpensive and then you can order a muffin or side of eggs and keep even our pickiest young eater happy. SG enjoyed his omelette and bacon. I LOVED my protein pancakes. They have granola in them. Absolutely delicious! I was upset initially that everyone else was served (including two other protein pancake orders) and that they had not made mine to serve at the same time. But, to smooth it over, they brought me a plate of fresh fruit and the manager even came over later to apologize personally.   I think this place does it right. The food is good, the service is both good and respectful, and the setting is great (especially for a baseball game.)   ***** A little sneaky fact, the dirt parking lot across the street is FREE and you can park there and walk the 3 blocks to the ballpark. No hunting around for parking and reading all the signs to make sure that you will not get a ticket. Just leave us a spot when we are there...."}
{"text":"I enjoy the California Benedict.  The service is always friendly and the food comes out fairly quickly.    The coffee is standard restaurant quality, but more expensive than starbucks or coffee bean!"}
{"text":"What great place to come for a quick breakfast!  I must admit when we pulled up I saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that I didn't want to go in cause there looks like a line.  But he convinced me that we should just go in.    We walked in and the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes I surprised how fast they seated us.  There was soo much to choose from on the menu, but I am such a simple girl I just wanted to egg, bacon, and potatoes, and that's what I got! And the Decaf wasn't too bad either!  The real reason why I chose to eat here was because I read Gabi M's review who is the community manager of Scottsdale/PHX area.  The funniest thing is that just as we got our coffee a guy walked by and I noticed that it was Gabi's husband, then who should be walking behind him GABI!!! Loved that! always great to see you Gabi!!! Thanks for your review!  Great place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast spot with patio seating for our dog. Everyone was accommodating, our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food came out quick and not only was it tasty but the portions were huge. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Breakfast...  a leisurely one is a great way to start a weekend.  On a recent Saturday morning, my friend and I stopped by U.S. Egg in search of a favorite breakfast indulgence - Eggs Benedict.   We were seated promptly, and our friendly waitress highly recommended both the Eggs Benedict (for me) and a slight variation, the California Benedict (including bacon and avocado), for her.    Both dishes looked great when they arrived, and even included a nice side of hash browns.  However, the letdown was immediate when I cut in to my first egg.  The yolk was... solid!  No delightfully runny goodness to mix with the hollandaise.  My friend's eggs were overdone as well.  What happened?  My guess is the dishes sat a bit too long under a heat lamp after being plated.  So disappointing.  :(  I may give U.S. Egg another try, as a number of other menu items looked tempting.  The restaurant was bright and inviting, and the service was quick and friendly.  Still, how can you serve Eggs Benedict with overcooked yolks!?"}
{"text":"Deelicious breakfast! Was my first visit here and definitely not my last. Had the Idaho veggie skillet and huevos rancheros and PROTEIN PANCAKES! Yummy :)) service was great too :) very friendly front staff!"}
{"text":"After reading Brian's review of this place, it makes me want to go back and try a burger.   Predictably, I stuck with my instinct when I went to U.S. Egg and got . . . eggs. I know, I know. Not very original. But, for the record, it was the Eggs Benedict, actually. And they hit the spot.   The setup was Denny's-esque and we almost felt like we were in a cubicle as we ate breakfast. So, that wasn't good. Our server was friendly but it looked like her section had atleast twelve tables in it and it was busy so she barely had time to breathe.   The breakfast was tasty, despite the bleak setup, and it worked effectively as a good hangover buster on that weekend morning. I'll be back in there sometime soon, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Cute place. Full menu. Food was a little cold. Coffee was good :)"}
{"text":"Great service, quite a wide selection of breakfast and delicious food, with decent prices. A great place to stop and get something quick and filling, which was exactly why we stopped there both days during our trip to Arizona.   The food came out quick and hot, the protein pancakes were a little dry the first day, but the husband raved about the pastrami sandwich. I liked the Eggs Benedict the next day, and the potatoes were delicious on the side.   Overall, great place for a quick bite, as long as the wait isn't too long."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast!  The half and half  with protein pancakes and a ham, sausage and mushroom Idaho skillet."}
{"text":"I gave this place a mixed review last year because I had a single bad experience with a bad server. Since then I have eaten here dozens of times and it is now my go-to breakfast spot. The service is outstanding, I love the healthy options on the proteins and greens section of the menu, and the food is terrific. I am especially impressed with the wait staff - somebody obviously provided them with some seriously good training on customer service and it shows. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"It wasn't until my second visit here that I realized this place is not The Good Egg, hahahaaa  Ok...so I may have called in sick one day from work because I needed a \"me\" day and started it off with U.S. Egg.  What a brilliant idea suggested by my gentleman caller.    I ordered the Horn of Plenty Omelet and yes it was!  I just can't seem to order anything but omelets.  I love all the diced veggies, cheese and yummy egg.  I sampled some of his blueberry pancakes and washed it down with coffee and OJ.  It just doesn't get any better than that!    The service was great and the wait was short (but it was a work day).    *I did go back on a weekend and the wait was not bad.  Side note:  I still have not tried the Good Egg but it's on the list."}
{"text":"I like the variety of breakfast items. It's easy to give every one a choice of items and sizes of breakfast. I do like the protein pancakes. They're a whole grain pancake, with nuts, a little coconut?, blueberries, etc. I make them unhealthy with all the butter. They don't really need the syrup. Service is always pleasant and fast. They leave you with a carafe of coffee and a pitcher of water."}
{"text":"My beloved friend and I decided to come here after driving across the country. We googled breakfast places in the area and this was one of the highest rated. After reading the plethora of delicious options, we decided to give it a shot. Portions were perfectly sized and delicious. We left comfortably full. Our waitress had a bubbly personality and had a great sense of humor. Although it was a Tuesday morning, the waitress could probably tell that we were EXTREMELY hungover, so she provided us with a full pot of coffee and a large pitcher of water without a request haha."}
{"text":"Breakfast here was great!  Highly recommend it!  Seeing what the rest of Scottsdale has to offer, I was disappointed that they didn't serve dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place! The protein pancakes keep me coming back. A lower carb option, it lets me splurge on a tasty breakfast without too much guilt. I usually order those and a side of super crispy bacon. They even have sugar free maple syrup, just ask! Check the hours to avoid disappointment; they close around 2 pm. You won't have much of a wait if you come during the week at lunchtime, but expect a long wait time if you want to eat at peak breakfast or brunch hours on weekends. Always friendly service and good food. Love how they leave a big carafe of ice water on your table so you never have to wait for a server to refill your glass. One of my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant just south of Old Scottsdale. Good service. Average $8 entry...$6 for 2 eggs. potato and english muffin"}
{"text":"Great service  Nice variety on menu  Big portions  Competitive prices  Good food (quality and taste)  I love that they leave a water pitcher and coffee pot in the table.  Sometimes crowded but well worth the wait.  Great location just south of Old Town Scottsdale next to Olive Garden and Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning. Party of two. The place is very large, clean with a friendly staff.  Breakfast was good, nothing outrageous and the water taste TERRIBLE!! Not sure about the coffee, I brought my own from Starbucks. I felt the prices were a bit high.  Server was excellent. Nothing too special about this breakfast place. Not sure if I'd return with so many other options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow!! Absolutely stellar food and service. It was my first time trying this place out, ordered the steak and eggs, and was frankly blown away because I wasn't expecting such high quality steak from a breakfast place. Every bite was savory and spectacular. Eggs were cooked to perfection as were the hash browns. Ask for Brittani; she was great!"}
{"text":"The eggs taste so good.  Everything we have had is amazing.  We came 3 days for breakfast and some lunches. Wish we were not leaving the area but our trip moves us on.  Top notch service by Ava and other friendly servers!   You must stop in and eat here"}
{"text":"Excellent - food and service! Tried this restaurant for brunch as was meeting out-of-town friend and the reviews were super, and as it turned out, accurate! Several familiar brunch items and then another dimension of \"don't miss\" specialties. I had the half and half with the US Egg Protein Pancakes and it was delicious! This is The Place to go for a treat for family, friends, guests and best of all you owe it to yourself!"}
{"text":"Been bringing the family here since they opened. Great family business and best protein pancakes around! I recommend the half-n-half with the protein pancakes and chicken-avocado!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was eggceptional!!! Fast and great service! And awesome food! Tastes amazing and fresh"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a nice early dinner.  I love eggs, so this place hit the spot.  I can eat eggs all day long.  Their portions are huge and I loved their sausage and crispy bacon that came with my meal."}
{"text":"US Egg is our go-to place for breakfast.  They are so good at customizing your order, and ensuring you get what you want.  My favorite is their Florentine special - yummy spinach, mushrooms with eggs and hollandaise.  How can you go wrong?  I love their grits, and they serve a big bowl with lots of butter.  I know - it's so bad/good, but I only get them once in a while. Guilty pleasure.   My husband loves their protein pancakes - they are really flavorful.  He also loves the chorizo and the way they will deep fry the hash browns for you.  And now they have mimosas and bloody Mary's available.  Heaven."}
{"text":"US Egg is one of my favorite \"typical\" breakfast places -- nothing fancy with standard breakfast foods. If you have a hankering for pancakes, you must have the protein and blueberry cakes! The skillets are very good as well. I like that the owners are always visible, and friendly. I definitely prefer a local spot over a chain, even if I have to wait a little longer for a table."}
{"text":"Large dinner style breakfast joint. Best eggs Benedict in town. Pretty normal price 10-12 per breakfast."}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods. It's easy to make pancakes, eggs, and bacon at home, but it's fun to go out every once in a while and get something different. I love their whole wheat pancakes. I got strawberry pancakes with eggs and bacon with orange juice. The strawberries were delicious, and they topped the pancakes with lots of whipped cream. Amazing. They also have protein pancakes.  My boyfriend did mention that the coffee wasn't great, but compared to a similar breakfast restaurant (ahem, The Good Egg), it wasn't good there, either. So he didn't hold it against them. He had blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon and he loved it. Even so far as to say that the food was better, albeit more expensive at U.S. Egg.  Also, for a Saturday morning/early afternoon, we were seated right away and our food came out super quickly. All around great service as well.  I will always come back, but not as often as I'd like because our bill was $24. Ouch! Only giving it 4/5 stars because it's more expensive than the competitors. If I could, I'd give it 4.5! :)"}
{"text":"I had the half and half with the protein pancakes, which were seriously amazing and the Santa Fe skillet.   Starting off with the pancakes because I've never had anything like them. They're packed with blueberries and granola and I don't know what else but they were amazing. And the Santa Fe skillet was delicious! It was the right amount of kick with some Cholula and was just awesome! Next time I'm gonna see if they can do the hash browns a little crispier."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Happy people. The breakfast skillets are huge!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation of a friend/family member. Nice building and nice ambiance. Good was in par with what we expected. Nothing special but we didn't come for anything other than an what I guess you would call and American Breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and hash browns. Small drink cups which is fine if the server is on top of it. We liked it"}
{"text":"Everytime I am in the Phoenix area we make it a point to go to one of the U.S. Egg locations, this time we went to this one in Scottsdale for the first time. The food was delicious as always and the service was terrific. Love the protein pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Interior can certainly be modernized, however the food is solid. I'm not a fan of paying to sub hash browns and a english muffin for fruit. Seeing as how I am now paying more for less food. All in all, US Egg is a solid stop in spot every now and then. One of those resturants you're glad that exists, but you'll never take anyone there to show them."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Visiting from Palm Springs, CA. Loved the protein pancakes with the skillet. Perfect amount of food to start the day! U.S.EGG!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but a little overcooked. Nothing was inedible though. I had the California Benedict. It was definitely tasty. My husband had the corned beef hash and enjoyed it. I also had a Bloody Mary and it was really good. It had a pickle and olive which I like way better than when it has celery. That's just my personal opinion though. The service was fast too. It was around $30 for the two of us. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"A solid option for a delicious breakfast in Scottsdale. A popular spot, but we were able to get a table immediately early on a Saturday morning.   The menu has so many great options. The hard part was narrowing to just one breakfast item per person. There are about a dozen options each for omelets, specialties, and pancakes/waffles. Benedicts and traditional breakfast options are also available. U.S. Egg is also a lunch spot.   I had the Going South Omelet which had chorizo, green chiles, and cheese inside. It was served with a side of hash browns. It was a really large and had plenty of filling, especially the chorizo. This is the kind of breakfast that allows you to completely bypass lunch. My husband had the Sonora breakfast burrito. The Sonora has the same filling ingredients as the Going South Omelet, but is all stuffed into a giant burrito. The Sonora also comes with a side of hash browns. Other sides can be substituted at an additional charge. My husband enjoyed his burrito, but the outside is a little on the dry side. It comes with salsa, but it would probably be better smothered Christmas style. Overall, both dishes were satisfying though."}
{"text":"PROTEIN PANCAKES. That's all you need to know. You can thank me later.  Also pictured: eggs with cheese, sausage, grits, California benedict :)  And very friendly service. But seriously...protein pancakes. What are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY!! I first need to speak to the outdoor patio! It's 90 degrees today & I wanted to find a dog friendly place but big issue is that even if the place had a patio, it's too hot! I called, they told me it was very well shaded & had misters. And they were right, the patio was full of people & extremely comfortable and NO FLIES! Something about the heat brings flies but not one found here!  On to the food. Great selections, great taste. I used Yelp to find this place and saw all the skillets, and had to try one. Our server was adorable, young girl, very friendly and chatty. She was at our table for a good 10 minutes just telling us about the area.   The menu has a bunch of protein selections, like protein pancakes, waffles etc, which is really neat when you are trying to eat clean. (I am on vacation so I just skipped that section) but if I had a U.S. Egg near me in California, I would be there much more often which would allow me to select better choices for my waist line. My bf got the protein pancakes with blueberries and said they were delicious.   Why not 5 stars? I think the pricing is a bit high for the portions. Yes, the food is quality but its standard eggs, potatoes, yogurt, oatmeal, nothing too unique here. Maybe its because the location is in Scottsdale? I don't know, I went to another breakfast place yesterday morning in Scottsdale called Randy's (the prices were fantastic, like mouth dropping prices!!"}
{"text":"2 Words: PROTEIN PANCAKES   They are delish!! This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town. Everything on the menu looks great, but every time I tell myself I will venture and order something different... I can't. I guess thats a good problem to have :)  P.S. They are ginormous so plan on sharing or taking some home for later."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here. Friendly service and great breakfast. I'll continue to make this one of my breakfast destinations."}
{"text":"My hotel, which served complimentary continental breakfast, was actually able to tide me over for the days staying in AZ, so I didn't really have to go out and eat very often, however, I got sick of it after awhile, so I thought it'd be really cool to go out and get something worth my while before flying back out.  I went here to Yelp; with the average high reviews; and having it a block away - I was looking forward to getting myself a bang-ass meal!  The interior didn't look as cozy as I had hoped - tables, chairs, floors were in the same color pine, and the walls were yellow. I wasn't too impressed yet. The host greeted me immediately, and took me to a table.   I waited about 5 minutes before the server came by. She didn't introduce herself, nor did she tell me what the specials were - and the only reason that I know this is because I had seen them on the blackboard. She took my drink order, which was water, and she left and came back with a full pitcher of water with lemon. She eyeballed my glasses, and said, \"oh, they look dirty!\" and left and came back with another.  Nonetheless, the server was super nice - typical college student.  I went with the Eggs Benedict with extra avocado added, and after only about 10 mintues, she came back with my order.  None of it was hot; the poached eggs were lukewarm, and the muffins, and hash browns, were room temperature.  The muffins - looked to be wheat - which I don't remember being indicated on the menu! Things like this are important to call out - if customers order it and have a food allergy.  The avocado was cold because they had just taken them out of the refrigerator. The sauce wasn't too heavy, but could've used just a tad bit more lemon. Overall, the taste of it was pretty OK, but could have been much better if the temperature was right-on-the-moeny.  I gave my feedback to the server, asked me if I wanted another one; I mentioned that I was traveling, and didn't have the time. Because she was apologetic and offered to correct the situation in a way that she knew how, her response was reasonable.  I gave my feedback to the manager, who was receptive, and though I provided my feedback AFTER I paid the bill, the right thing to do for him would have been to offer a credit. If he had offered one, though, I wasn't planning on taking it nonetheles. I wouldn't have taken it nonetheless, but it's all about the principle of the matter. I intentionally paid my bill before providing feedback.  All-in-all, I SEE the potential in both the service, and the food, though my humble opinion is that they would probably benefit from better mentorship or training from the manager."}
{"text":"Great service, the place is really nice and the breakfast is awesome!  Definitely love the pancakes here!"}
{"text":"Great food!  In fact on our travels to Scottsdale we look forward to stoping in here and do multiple times. Prices are great and service is better. Thanks so much for not changing the way you do things over the past couple of years. When we come for spring training you are on our list to stop at multiple times."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is the half and half protein pancakes and veggie skillet. Everyone is so friendly and lend great service!"}
{"text":"Poor service, waitress was snippy and rude. I have been in this restaurant numerous times with friends and family. Twice with people having a birthday. I brought my sister there because it was her birthday and from previous experience, I knew she would get a pancake treat if she wished.  When I asked the waitress about this she said \"well no one has ever asked me that before and no we don't do that.\"She then stated she went back and asked two managers and they \"all\" said no. If the policy changed then fine, the problem was the woman's rude demeanor.  We said ok and continued with our breakfast. I was sad for my sister and was very displeased with the way the situation was handled.  Food is ok. I can get \"ok\" food with amazing service at ANY breakfast spot in this city and will do so from now on. I brought a lot of business in this restaurant and will not do so any longer. Disappointed."}
{"text":"US Egg is a great breakfast place.  The Half and half is the best of both worlds.  You get to try their signature protein pancakes and your choice of half a skillet."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and when I was visiting Arizona I had to try! Glad to say I was not disappointed!  The atmosphere appears very clean and family oriented. The decorations are cool with bunch of egg crates making up the US Flag!   The service was great, attentive and fast.   I ordered the half and half which included the southwestern skillet and the protein pancakes! I was highly pleased.   Just a heads up, the portions are huge so you will either be stuffed or not finish. There are many skillet options I chose the southwestern and it was cooked to perfection. They make your eggs anyway you want them. Ask for your hash browns to be extra crispy. You're welcome in advance. If you don't know, the skillet is basically all the ingredients you choose based on your selection, the eggs of your choice and has browns all in one bowl.  The protein pancakes are heavenly! I need the recipe ASAP! It has blueberries and I'm not sure what else but I can't wait until I'm back!  The price is very affordable. Next time I will do another skillet for variety but I will stick to the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid three stars...it was a pretty typical breakfast place, nothing special.  I had the vege skillet which was ok except some of the potatoes were undercooked and some overcooked...GF had eggs Benedict an the eggs were over done as well.  Hollandaise needed more lemon:  I would eat there again but it's not  the best breakfast I have ever had!"}
{"text":"For the price point, there are better places. The coffee was diluted, we had omelettes they were ok. One was returned for being overdone and was recooked quickly. Service is good; but food could be better. Not coming back  We had: 2 omelettes and coffee = $28.56 (excluding tip)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with brunch here. I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were overcooked (cooked all the way through, no running yolk), and they used very little hollandaise sauce. If a restaurant with the word \"egg\" in its name cannot make a decent Eggs Benedict, you know it's a bad restaurant.    If the yolk doesn't run, I run."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  Seating was fast. Server was great. They had coffee set out while we waited for our table, but the coffee station was messy and coffee was empty. Boo!   At breakfast, half of my breakfast came to the table cold. My eggs were warm, but my hash browns, bacon and belgian waffle were cold. I can deal with cold bacon, but as I tried to spread the butter across my \"fresh\" waffle, it just \"sat\" on top. Ewww.   Our server was awesome. I was able to let her know right away that although I was ok with keeping the bacon and eggs, I really wanted a hot belgian waffle. She apologized and took it back to the kitchen, where the kitchen committed a cardinal sin... they took the same waffle I just sent back and put it in the microwave.   I suspected it was the same waffle when I saw the caramel-colored brown spots on top where I tried to spread the butter previously, but just to be sure I checked the bottom. Yep; soggy from the microwave.  Ewww.  I was no longer in the mood for a belgian waffle.   I would give it one star, but I appreciated my server, and I actually really like the casual decor, the patio and the restrooms."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit (and Mom's first).  I had such a great time on my first visit (Monday, 3/16) with Selva as my server that I couldn't wait to return with Mom this morning.  We arrived at around 1130 am and was given a ten-minute wait at the host's stand.  I was a little confused at first as to why there were ten, or so, of us waiting on benches when I could easily spot available tables (two four-tops, and two six-tops, plus empty seating in the \"sun room\"), but I thought perhaps the servers and/or kitchen were bogged down with their work loads and the host was trying to manage it by slowing down the seating of new arrivals...  (She would, from time to time, go visit the kitchen and come back out, so perhaps I was correct in my observations.)  After about ten minutes, we were seated at one of the four-tops I saw was available when we arrived.    It was another ten minutes before our server Brandy greeted us.  She asked how we were, and I said that we were very hungry and knew what we wanted to order.  She said \"well, you're at the right place if you're hungry... what would you like to order?\"  I asked for coffee for the both of us and protein pancakes for me, and Mom asked for chicken-fried steak.  After asking how Mom wanted her eggs and if we needed cream for the coffee (no for me, yes for Mom), she left to put in our orders.  Brandy arrived shortly with the coffee carafe and poured our coffees and left a mini-carafe of cream on the table.  Mom asked if this was the cream and before she could finish her question, Brandy said \"yes, that is half-and-half... creamer,\" and then walked away.  Mom was put-off by that and told me \"no tip for her!\"  Mom wanted to ask if the creamer was a vanilla-flavored one... I said maybe she's having a tough morning and see if she gets less curt with us.  After about fifteen minutes, Brandy drops off our food and asks if we need anything else (more napkins) and then leaves.  Mom enjoyed her chicken-fried steak.  The steak was cut, battered, and fried the same as those we've tried at other diners in the past, and what made it delicious was the sausage gravy, made with roux (and not slurry!), as well as the crispiness of the batter.  She also enjoyed her hash browns.  My protein pancakes weren't as loaded as they were when Selva was my server (and now I always ask to be seated in Selva's section!), so I just ate the areas that had the granola, almonds,  blueberries, and chocolate chips and cut off the bald spots of my entree and put them off to the side.  We were ready to put away our leftovers and asked Brandy for boxes.  When she arrived, instead of placing them on our table, or handing them to our outstretched arms, she just held them up so high that I had to REACH up and out to take them out of her hands.  WTH?  Definitely only change for your tip, Brandy!  (Maybe I should change my policy and just leave nothing?)  I was so miffed, I asked the host if I may speak with the manager, and soon Shayla (sp?) came out to speak with me.  After we told her of our complaints about Brandy's words and behavior that morning, Shayla apologized and offered some reparation for us to come back, which surprised us and I kindly accepted.  Usually when my Mom gets offended by a server, she never wants to return anymore (say like at Eggstasy), and I haven't had any luck talking her into joining me at US Egg, but I've returned at least twice since this visit and sat at Selva's section and had protein pancakes loaded the way I like them!  Thank you Shayla for listening to our complaints without being defensive and also inviting us to come back.    BTW, I like the \"sun room\" portion of the restaurant- a nice area to be seated during the nice months of the year!"}
{"text":"One of my gentleman friend's really likes this place and I trusted his opinion because he usually has a big.........appetite. Let me tell you this place is the BEES KNEES!!!  We were seated within two hot seconds and our food came as quick as it takes to dance the jitterbug. Holy cow was the food great! Omelets were the cats pajamas.. coffee was hot and rockin'. After being a boozehound at the local speakeasy last night this place definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This place never dissapoints!! Their food is great and their customer service is EXEMPLARY!! I stopped in today to grab breakfast to go.  Unfortunately they were expecting a power outage. Even though it was something out of their control, they met me at the door, explained the situation and presented me with a coupon toward my next order.  Made my day.. Unfortunately the other place I went in the very near vicinity was a HUGE disappointment. Won't go back. US Egg has my loyalty!!"}
{"text":"We can only catch this place on the weekend, they close by 2 and sometimes there is a wait, but every time we have gone, the food has been excellent. You can order the food the way you like, requesting egg whites, no tomato, whatever you need to rearrange the omelette's or other choices to your taste and the food comes promptly. Large menu which also has lunch items and combos, not just breakfast fare. Nice fruit plate, options for Vegetarians, Omnivores and Carnivores. The wait staff is pretty attentive, keeps up on refills and smiles. The price is about where good breakfast food is these days, this isn't a 99cent breakfast slam, it's approximately 8 bucks per choice, other things are a la cart so it's really simple to get what you like. I got the California Benedict, with just right amounts of canadian bacon, avocado, hollandaise and english muffin. The potatoes weren't burnt or raw, and I could season them myself. Other people got spinach florentine, frittata, steak and eggs, protein platter. Serving size is just right, for the lighter eater, might be a little left over. They can split checks when you ask. Parking lot is decent sized, but this place is popular. My advice is visit around 8:30am. You'll beat the crowd and be very happy."}
{"text":"For  a place that specializes in breakfast, omelets in particular, they were TERRIBLE!!! Be ready for a giant lukewarm pan sized egg scramble placed on top of your cold fillings and if cheese is one of the fillings, it will be placed on the top of the flat egg thing, not melted. If you want a good breakfast for a lot less money go to Randy's on Chaparral Rd (cash only). Skip this place for a breakfast, you'd make a better one at home, save your money. Service was not great either, the waitress was looking for fast turn over and must not realize she gets tipped on her service. Was here on a Friday, 10-1030 am. Never going back."}
{"text":"Food was really good. But environment and service not the best. Really good place for breakfast  skillets was really good"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The chicken and waffles are better and cheaper than LOLOS (which is just down the street).   Disappointed I couldn't substitute my eggs for another waffle or anything, but that's just how life works, I guess.   The food is delicious.  The prices are decent.  The service wasn't bad.    4 stars!"}
{"text":"Pretty crappy service. Don't know who my server even was because she disappeared immediately after dropping our food at the table. She brough an extra soda for my friend implying she knew she wouldn't be back to our table; which she wasnt. I wanted to order another mimosa but couldn't get anyone's attention which is surprising because I can still see a few servers just standing around doing nothing.   Suddenly different server comes up and brings us our check and says she'll be our cashier. Nice of her to get us out of here in a timely manner but she wasn't our server and we weren't even done eating.    I've been here before and it's pretty much always he same thing but this time was definitely the worst. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once every time we visit Scottsdale. It's always great! The breakfast selections and quality are top notch, and the service is extremely friendly and accommodating and quick. We love this place."}
{"text":"Pancakes, waffles, skillets the menu is quite extensive. Portions are generous and pricing is decent.  -Coffee $2.99 -banana pancake $6.69 -chocolate chip pancake $6.69 -garden omelette $10.99  The Coffee was perfect and refilled every time. pancakes are huge about the size of a dinner plate, a small portion is good for one person. I wasn't particularly a fan of the protein pancakes they are not your usual fluffy ones. The eggs came with a side of muffin and hash. My muffin was burnt and the hash wasn't done but the server was quick to change them once i pointed that out.   I would love to try the other items on the menu but the service was much better than the food.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Like many people have stated, the protein pancakes are great- I dont care for anything else but them which is why I rate at 4 stars. The service is excellent and the menu is HUGE, lots of options."}
{"text":"This U.S. Egg has been here awhile and I finally stopped in recently. Honestly, I've driven by it a zillion times (I live close by), and I don't know why I've always ignored it.   The thing I like it about (besides the food, which I'll get to) is that it's a step above a Denny's/IHOP, but not as hoity-toity as the breakfast/brunch spots in Old Town (which is funny because it's located JUST south of all those places).   I went for breakfast on a Saturday, and I was surprised it wasn't very crowded. I went w/a friend & her aunt, and we all enjoyed our meals. I got an omelette, that came w/hashbrowns & an English muffin. It was solid. I also had coffee, and I liked that they left a carafe at the table, because, well...I drink a lot of coffee.   Service, portions, & prices are all spot on.   Basically, this is just a \"nicer\" diner-type breakfast place. And I mean that as a good thing."}
{"text":"Idaho skillet and protein pancakes!!! Amazing! Also the wait is quick even if there are a lot of people! The service is also fast and friendly. Everything was served hot and together."}
{"text":"This place is sorta pricey but the food, oh man, the food is soooo freakin' good. Especially if you love eggs and pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is not terribly creative or unique in anyway, but it is solid in terms of their offerings. The portions are generous and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy and yummy!  I was excited to see a variety of veggie options (besides pancakes).  I enjoyed the Veggie Benedict, very delicious.  My son enjoyed the \"dollar pancakes\" from the kids menu which are not dollar sized, they're normal sized pancakes and it comes with 3!  An absolute steal at only $4.99. My husband had the Denver omelette, he said it was pretty good not great, but not bad.  My mom enjoyed the Blueberry waffles, and she said they were amazing!  I liked that they had fresh blueberries on top, not just blueberry pie filling like you find at some places.  Prices are not cheap, but in my opinion very reasonable.  My only real complaint is the service was terrible.  We were in slightly before the rush, by the time we left there was a wait but none when we came in.  I was disappointed that our server couldn't keep drinks filled.  The topper was when she dumped creamer on our table and just brought extra napkins.  Didn't wipe it up, didn't even really apologize to my husband who she dumped it in front of. Luckily he got out of the way of wearing it.    We'll be back, but I really hope the service improves next time."}
{"text":"First our server Christine 232 was fantastic.  She was very attentive and had a bright smile.   My friend and I notice a homeless lady standing outside in the cold.  I ask Christine if we could buy her breakfast and she went up to the owner of the US EGG to ask.  From where I was sitting in a loud voice I over heard him say I already had a few days ago.  So the answer is no! This is a man that won't pay it forward no matter how many times. I work at a resort up the street and I use to tell my clients about this place but not anymore.  I rather send them to Denny's across the street than to a place with no heart.   I will never step food in here again"}
{"text":"Protein Waffle is to die for. This local institution is a fan favorite for all SF Giant fans attending spring training at Scottsdale stadium. I have to say the food here is delicious. I always get the triple play combo with their famous protein waffle. The protein waffle is their Belgium waffle batter with granola, blueberries, cinnamon and other goodness mixed in. Mmmmmmm!!! I also love that their juices are fresh squeezed. I am subtracting one star though because the last time few times I went there the lack of service by the waitresses were subpar. It was neither spectacular or horrendous."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant with lots of choices this is the place.  Good quality food with large portions.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow I got the meat lover skillet and it was more food than I expected! It had bacon, sauce, ham, chicken fried steak, eggs, and hash browns! Plus a English muffin on the side! I would have given it 5 stars but it wasn't really busy and the service was average at best!"}
{"text":"I love US Egg.  The Protein Pancakes are awesome.  I put the Protein pancakes in the Triple Play, it comes with Eggs and Bacon.  Good way to start the day.  Friendly staff and the owners all ways are there to greet and say hello."}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was great! This time no so much. I ordered a veggie skillet and it came out with sausage. They took it back and I thought they made me a new one but they actually just picked the sausage out but forgot one. I was disgusted. I'm sure that's against health code to pick in someone's food and take it back out to them."}
{"text":"our group was heading to Butter fields, wait was extremely long, we were hungry, we drove by US Egg, I gave them a call, George told us the wait or our group of 7 was 20 min and he would put our name on the list...was up hill from there...food and service were all very good..."}
{"text":"Everything that is bad about a breakfast place in one spot!  1) Overpriced...2 eggs, toast &  sausage for my mom and I had a pumpkin waffle for a total bill of $22 + oh we did have coffee too. That seems like a lot to me.  2) The food was cold and the waitress never came by to ask how it was so we could not tell her about it.  What was worse was that she was \"training\" some new girl.  Good luck with that.  3) When we flagged her down to comment on the cold food we were 75% finished so what was the point.  I saw her talk to the manager about it, but nothing was done.  She offered to replace it, but I don't want more cold food.  4) When we left the manager who was told about our cold food was the one who checked us out, never asked how it was since he didn't want to hear about the complaint...can you say \"CHICKEN SHIT?\"  Save your self some money and headaches and just go to Denny's get twice as much food for half the $$..."}
{"text":"Food:        3/5 Service:   4/5 Decor:      3/5  Not the worst place I've ever had. Clearly they're doing something right with the amount of good reviews here.  Construction in the parking area but not the biggest deal.  Weird odor outside. Something leaked into the parking spots and smells like rotten milk.  The interior seems a bit outdated. The staff is nice. The food is very.... mediocre. Kinda plain and dry. Veggie Benedict was.... ok.  Fresh squeezed OJ was good."}
{"text":"I heart the 'Protein Pancake!'   Typical breakfast goodness. Big plus-- being a soda connoisseur, their unending flow of diet coke is worthy of cracking any one's hangover!"}
{"text":"The place is cute, food was fresh, and the service was good. But, the food was blah. I was very disappointed, hoped for something more. You can get better food and MUCH better prices across the street at Denny's."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The half and half is perfect. You get a skillet and 2 protein pancakes. Highly recommended. They have flavored creamer for the coffee.... thumbs up"}
{"text":"Nothing but wonderful, positive things to say about this business!  We've been enjoying their delicious food for probably 25 years now and we've followed them all over the valley!  You won't be disappointed when you spend your time and money here.  Excellent food!  Fabulous service!  Wonderful environment!  We love U.S. Egg and the family that owns it.  We've never had a bad experience and I can't think of too many places that I can say that about."}
{"text":"I love me some protein pancakes and so when my friends and I met up prior to an event at the civic center, we stopped here for breakfast. This was my first time at this location but everything was up to par with my experiences at US Egg. The food and service were great"}
{"text":"Food is always great but love their gluten-free menu including their gluten-free French toast. It's incredible. Most places have very bland gluten free food but they use spices on their toast that make it so yummy. Definitely worth a try for GF foodies."}
{"text":"We came to this location after seeing a \"no wait\" sign from Shea. I am glad that we swung around and our party of 10 decided to dine here, because they were able to accommodate us no problem! Better than waiting 35-40 minutes at the other place. The server was very attentive and patient. I love how they leave coffee carafes on the table so all of us could simply refill our own coffee. I had the half and half - protein pancakes and an omelette. It was huge and filling and the protein pancakes are to die for. I seriously want to find a copycat recipe of that and be able to make it at home every day. My kids got the chocolate chip pancakes and I snuck more than one bite, they were so good. Generous portions, good prices...I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Okay, I don't even like sausage or chorizo or anything that comes in a casing. But the chicken chorizo scramble sounded good for some reason, and it was probably the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. I got the half and half of course because I can't live without those amazing protein pancakes. But the chicken scramble with chorizo was just insane. I don't even have words to describe it. I wanted to cry it was so good. Please just go here and get exactly what I ordered. For the record I told her to hold the tomato, it just didn't sound like the right ingredient to keep in the mix, and I was happy without them even though I normally love tomato, just not for breakfast.  I better start planning on how to convince my boyfriend we need to go back here again ASAP."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant since 1995 when opened in Tempe.  Had the half and half w the ham skillet.  Protein pancakes were good.  Skillet was awful.  Hash Browns were luke warm at best, meat in skillet was sorta warm.  Over easy egg was medium.  Last rwo visits to you guys have been away from Tempe and very subpar.  I guess I will omly go to Tempe location and since its 35 miles from my house, not too often now.  Sad to have to write this but you guys need to step up the game."}
{"text":"Wow. Awesome. Great spot. Great staff. Incredible omelette options.  My omelette overflowing with bacon, tomato, a I and grilled chicken was perfect. Hope to have time for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I got the garden omelet when out for breakfast with my husband. It was absolutely disgusting. It was very bland and sitting in a giant pool of brown liquid.  I could only stomach one bite of it. There was also bacon stuck to the side of it (I am a vegetarian). My husband was finished his meal by the time our waitress came to ask how we were. I told her I didn't want mine, as it was not good at all and she asked if I wanted something else cooked. Because my husband was already finished, and didn't want to wait another 10 minutes for something to get cooked for me to then eat alone, I said no. I expected her to take mine off the bill since I didn't eat any of it, but she just slapped the bill down."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this breakfast joint. It reminded me alot of the good egg. The prices were reasonable, the portions were huge, and the quality was very good. The power pancakes were excellent, and quite different from any other pancake that I've had. The server was very courteous as well. Definitely a repeater."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very clean and nice. Service is exceptional. The food was good, tons of choices.  Probably not as healthy as they imply. Protein pancakes is really a carb pancake. The scrambles are good. I would be willing to bet that most of their food is canned and then cooked for your order."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on a trip to Scottsdale.  For me to eat more than once at a place while visiting is unusual and indicates a \"must-go\" restaurant.  Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I especially liked that the breakfast burrito actually had some heat to it."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not something Scottsdale restaurants in general do very well. U.S. Egg is one of the few exceptions. Their breakfast menu is expansive, and all the dishes we've tried are delicious. I am partial to the Sonoran Burrito with its chorizo. All the egg dishes come with hash browns which are typically cooked in a thick pile so the only crispness is on a thin layer on the outside. You never have to wait for coffee or water refills as the coffee is served in a thermal pot left on the table and water is served in a large pitcher, also left on the table. The portions are large - you will NOT leave hungry."}
{"text":"We had a solid experience here with both the food and service.  Had the Santa Fe skillet and I *almost* wanted to ask them for some hollandaise sauce to pour on top, but my heart was telling me \"DEAR GOD NOOOO.\"  The Lady had the spinach omelette, which was also very tasty.  What I probably liked the most about the place was that they provided a pitcher of Arnold Palmer at the table so that I could drink to my heart's content.  Even at the end of the meal, I was offered a to-go cup for the remaining drink.  That was awesome.  Is there any place around here that has a BLT with avocado and some green pepper sauce?  I guess taht'd make it a \"BLAT\" or something.... either way I wanna try one."}
{"text":"Here we have a very unfortunate situation:   5 Star Food.. 2 - 3 Star Service   The \"hosts\" at the front were really unfriendly /unwelcoming and when Julia T asked where the bike rack was, they just stared at here like she had just thrown down a cardboard box and was breakin like she was an Electric Boogaloo.   We sat out on the patio, which was lovely, until a group of women were seated next to us. I think they forgot to shower and decided that they should overload themselves with perfume. We were literally gagging throughout our meal. Obviously not US EGG's fault, but it made for a worse time.   I was debating a hot skillet and the protein pancakes and I almost ordered both until I happened to see the half-and-half. It was like heaven shone a light right onto this menu for me and created exactly what I wanted. Perfect!   My food was perfect. My two dining partners, however, received limp, soggy bacon. Nobody wants limp, soggy bacon... so Max makes mention and asks for more bacon. The lady actually charged him as a side, despite the fact that his original bacon was inedible. Um, Wha?!? When she brought the bill he disputed it and she got it removed, but it never should have been there in the first place.   Finally, the bathrooms there are not good. They smell bad and there were paper towels laying all over the place. I hate a dirty bathroom.   I will give this location another chance, but I will sit inside. If the service still bites, I will just go to the location on Baseline because I cannot stay away from the protein pancakes for too long!!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast / brunch place, right across the street from my hotel.  They were busy, but I got seated within a couple minutes. VERY friendly staff...!  Extensive menu, including high protein & gluten free selections. I had the west coast omelette, with grilled broccoli, and it was outstanding.  Looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast  food ever. The protein pancakes are insanely good- and even healthy!  That's a nearly impossible task for pancakes- but they pull it off.    Service is outstanding. The servers and owner always greet you with a smile. I always put in a difficult order- with substitutions and somehow they always seem to get it right!    For those of you that don't recognize quality or want something unhealthy and greasy- there's a Denny's across the street! LOL"}
{"text":"We're from Chicago and THIS breakfast place is a must try. Absolutely recommend it. Fast, friendly and comfortable environment.  Portion is huge. Everyone is very nice and prices so reasonable. Breakfast is not my favorite meal but THIS place makes me wish breakfast was every meal of the day :) nice huge menu might be back for lunch. Excellent. Id give it 10 stars.  The meat skillet and the avocado chicken and bacon skillet outstanding. Thanks to yelp! Btw, Vanessa and Sarah are GEMS to this establishment."}
{"text":"A sign of a good breakfast joint is a long wait to sit down. This place is pretty standard and basic - giant lofty room with wooden benches, glass plates, cheap flatware, chipped coffee mugs and your own coffee themos carafe to pour your own coffee. This place is standard and generic in every way - and that's a good thing. They take a formula that works everywhere and they run with it.   The food is fantastic - some of the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever eaten actually... tasty bacon... yummy protein pancakes.   The staff is great too - chipper and polite and cute. This place is a well-oiled machine doing one thing very well. The prices are pretty reasonable and even though we were 7th down on the list to wait - we were told it would only be 10 minutes and it was. Efficient, tasty, and reliable.  As a side note - perhaps one of the best parts about this place is that it's not the Breakfast Club and you don't have to look like you just went to the club... non-pretentious breakfast. Yum."}
{"text":"The food was great we got the California eggs Benedict and huevos rancheros with coffee, and oj  The service was decent. I would revisit!"}
{"text":"U.S. Egg, I christen thee with my first Phoenix area four star rating.  How could I have forgotten about you.  Definitely a breakfast place worth waiting for.  Corn beef hash.  mmmmm"}
{"text":"2 words....protein pancakes. These pancakes are amazing! They are made with blueberries and some other things including almonds. They have a taste of cinnamon also. Their eggs and skillets are usually pretty good too, but every time I go I have to get the protein pancakes.   I have never had to wait for a table, but I typically go pretty early for breakfast. The service has also always been good, never had a complaint about it. It is definitely one of my favorite places to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch every few weeks, the food and service are always good. When I walk in I am usually greeted by the owner(I think), and seated right away. They make decent coffee, and keep your cup full. The half sandwich and salad lunch special is a really good deal, the sandwich is huge and you get a lot of salad. I also enjoy the skillets as well as the breakfast sandwich.   The wait staff is attentive and always very friendly.   I am a regular here, and don not see that changing any time soon."}
{"text":"It was okay. Pricy for what it is. I got the pancake combo comes with 2 pancakes 4 sausages and scrambled eggs. Service was great"}
{"text":"Couple of my friends took me to this place saying it's really good and it turned out to be true. Let me start with their coffee which is amazing, I didn't expect that from a breakfast place. And I liked their protein pan cakes and \"Bay Area French toast\". If you're in or around Scottsdale, you better try this place for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Was not very good, got blueberry waffle it came out with defrosting cold blueberries. That didn't taste good at all. Friends potatoes were undercooked, service was nothing special. Complained about the blueberries and did not eat them, but still got charged. Wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"After first walking into Egg-Stacie, we ended up coming here. The noise level at the first place was simply too high to talk. This place was great! They had music playing, but at a reasonable volume. My wife and I both had Benedicts. She had the veggie and I had the traditional.  Just the right amount of sauce. High-quality ingredients, and a nice tart tanginess to the Hollandaise, but not too bitter.  Service was great and friendly, and they were thrilled to hear about this review and the one for the other restaurant. They said it made their day!"}
{"text":"Best protein pancakes ever!  You can get a super delish breakfast combo with eggs, hash browns, and protein pancakes for a super reasonable price.   One of my fave breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Took the family here for a morning meal on our vacation. Yelped it first and found the reviews to be spot on. Good solid breakfast food. Great for the kids. The protein pancakes were AMAZING! Loved it! What stood out more than the good food was the sparkling service. The manager/owner and his staff were amazing! I can't say enough about them. This is a good place to patronize, they are doing everything right. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definately coming to US Eggs!"}
{"text":"This is a great go-to brunch place for two specific things: no wait on the weekends and a late variety of options. We tried the half & half, which is certainly one of the better options on the menu. It comes with two protein pancakes, which are worthy trying, and a hot skillet, which was basic but filling. Although this is is not a place I would go to again and again, it was a good try."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, spacious, family friendly. Portions are large. Not impressed with quality of food/ taste. Definitely average and probably could have been better made at home. Ordered an omelette - came with hash browns and English muffin. Taste was bland. Pancakes were saving grace. They were delicious and wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Would only go back for pancakes most likely."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast spot!! Bring a friend and split the half-half so you get their delicious skillets ( I always add avocado and an extra egg if I'm sharing) and amazing protein pancakes. Their scrambled eggs and omelette are also delicious. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Well done Oscar. You do an awesome meal 12 years later from the first time I met you and the boys at the Tempe location. Your menu has always been a finer quality before anyone even knew better. I was in the area and had to stop in to see who was working. My meal was superb and my service excellent. You and the crew always give me the best. Thank You."}
{"text":"Other breakfast places take note :  If you are having a busy day (father's day) and a person who comes in by themselves asks for coffee:  \" Just give them a pot\"  I like how I was able to enjoy my breakfast and wash it down with coffee along the way, the hostess definitely came back to check on me but freed up plenty of time to take care of other larger tables that may have required more assistance ( I can appreciate the weighting associate with priorities )    She made great suggestions for what to have and I went with the skillet and pancakes, I know a lot of people rave about these in the reviews but I'm going to just say my two cents:  - the pancake was a little dry and not all that fluffy - the random bits of grain made the pancake inconsistent  - you definitely arnt getting a healthy option when you add in the butter and syrup.   Definitely not the worst tasting pancake but it just got way too built up in other reviews , thought I would set the record straight.    The skillet was amazing though so I would definitely recommend trying the chicken avocado bacon skillet and the pancake but not have this built up idea about how life changing those pancakes will be, overall great experience, will have to come back for the omelette    Also: love how they offered me coffee to go after I basically murdered that whole pot of coffee."}
{"text":"You will walk away stuffed.  And since the food tastes pretty darn good, it'll make sense as you drive away barely able to breathe.  I have never seen so many egg-based dishes.  There must be something like 3,000 to the 8th power dishes to choose from.  Service is very friendly and responsive.  I wish there was a U.S. Egg in the bay area..."}
{"text":"Over our brunch at US Egg today, I asked my wife how many times we've been here. Our best guess is 30-50 times, split between the Shea location in Scottsdale and Baseline in Tempe. We always get the triple play with protein pancakes and I get crispy bacon while she gets ham. The protein pancakes are amazing. I've tried to recreate them at home and I come close but theirs are perfect. We pass several well known and fantastic breakfast restaurants on our way to US Egg at least once a weekend...sometimes twice. The food has never been anything less than perfect and the service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Double boo for this place. I've been coming here since they only had 1 place on Mill and the dad ran it. Back then it was an awesome fun and tastey place to get a great bite to eat. Now it tastes and feels like corporate America. I couldn't be more disappointed.  I guess I'm giving them 2 stars for the memories.  But honestly this place might as well be the Dennys across the street. The food is now bland and the quality is mediocre at best. The fruit was old. Maybe frozen and not fresh anymore?  Service took a hit too. I'm in business. So I get it. Profits... But at what cost. Go back to your old ways.... I guess with the corporations taking over Scottsdale I was hoping this place would always be the same. Obviously I was wrong."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after staying across the street. Service is wonderful and staff is nice!! I had an omelet that was decent but the filling should have been more sautéed. Overall the food and service is great!!"}
{"text":"Holy Pancakes!!! What a meal we had. We were in the area and decided we needed a BIG breakfast. I looked through the pictures on YELP and couldn't decide what looked more satisfying. We get there around 1130, NO WAIT at all. Perfect for me because I was getting pretty \"Hangry\". Looking through this delicious menu I wanted everything, but this waitress wasn't going to wait forever, as patient as she was. I'm down to try new things but I know what I like and the ITALY OMELETTE was calling my name. Mushrooms, sausage, mozzarella cheese, marinara and pepperoni on top. What omelette can beat that? Yeah I couldn't think of one either haha. But why stop there? I'm a girl with a sweet tooth so I ordered powered sugar french toast off of the kids menu (pretty filling) and added bananas on top. A little extra charge but who cares when you're hungry right? Just go bananas you'll thank yourself later!!! I also had the pleasure of eating off of my boyfriends plate. He kept it simple & light and ordered a sirloin steak with broccoli. I rather indulge in the good, \"yet not so good for you\" food, but then again that's just me! He splurged a little and got their famous protein pancake. Good for you carb and calorie counters. It was massive, filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds. Simply delicious. Now that I have your mouth watering I think it's time you come in and taste for yourself. Remember: Go Bananas!"}
{"text":"Waffle me!!!  Great place for brunch but sometimes you will have to wait.  I have never had any complaints about the food or service.  Food comes out fast and hot.  The staff are helpful and very welcoming.  Ask for Rachel....she's the best!  I do love their breakfast potatoes.  The waffle with strawberries was the waffle fix I needed.  They have everything you could possibly want for breakfast or lunch.  Every time I go in I have a hard time deciding on what to eat but I am never disappointed.  Is it breakfast time?"}
{"text":"We live very close to this restaurant and it's been our go to breakfast place for years. Great service, large portions and the place all our out of town guests were taken. That has all changed. The once perky, friendly servers are now lifeless drones who act like they would rather be anywhere else. My wife and I ordered breakfast, asking for crispy hash browns. When the food came, the portion was literally half the size it used to be, and the hash browns were barely cooked. What once was the best breakfast spot in scottsdale is now a glorified Dennys. Very sad."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and service has been outstanding every time. Food has come out fresh, hot, and accurate, consistently. My infant son has been along with us a couple of times and they are always very accommodating, giving us a booth for the car seat or high chair. Love the breakfast sandwich, blueberry pancakes, and the Hawkeye omelette. We go early so we usually don't have a wait if it's before 9:30 on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot!  One of my favorite places in phx.  Their protein pancakes are legit!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very consistent food. Very consistent experience. Food comes out super fast too.   Truly nothing compares to the US Egg Protein Pancakes, a must have for most breakfast lovers.   I believe they are all Family owned restaurants and it shows in the best ways."}
{"text":"This place is a great breakfast restaurant. Everything I have tried has been delicious. The owners are very friendly and make you feel like your dining at home.  The service is always top notch.  I recommend trying the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"Good consistent food. Wished with the half and half it was a healthier side was available with the protein pancake but I'll take consistency.  Cups were small for drinks and our waitress brought two glasses of soda each to be efficient. Great thinking!"}
{"text":"Loved this location! I only knew of the one in South Scottsdale, which is great too btw. My husband and I went on a Sunday after church. Wait times at brunch spots can be up to an hour or more but here we were seated in 10 minutes and promptly greeted by the sweetest server. Our food was excellent. You have to try the to half and half!"}
{"text":"Have been here before and food was very good.  This time we went for breakfast and there was glass in one of the dishes. Manager was called and comped one breakfast, even though our morning breakfast outing was ruined. Didn't even comp the coffee!    I think that money is more important to them than satisfying a customer that had glass in their food.   A horrible experience.    Would have returned if manager apologized and did not charge us for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm still going back all of the time and I tried a couple of different things but have returned to and settled on my banana pancake and eggs breakfast -- I get the Jr Triple Play which is half the size of the regular so I have them add one egg   It works out perfectly and is cheaper.  Two sausage, 2 eggs (after I add one) and a single pancake.  Perfect.    ONE NOTE: they use fake butter so you have to request real butter if you don't want to eat nasty chemical margarine.  Unfortunately their margarine is pretty good, but note that it is still fake butter.  That's a bit of a disappointment in my second favorite place -- but they stay busy so apparently most people do t notice or care."}
{"text":"Just LOVE the PROTEIN PANCAKES with Extra Blueberries!!!!......The place is always packed, but has plenty of staff to handle the crowds!  Been there 6-9 times  and they have a wonderfully stocked menu of choices....."}
{"text":"Not good.  The whole wheat pancakes are ok, but for that to be your only batter option sucks.  The only condiments on the table are jelly and sugar.  They brought out ketchup in this tiny silver container, which only amounted to 1 spoonful.  The hash browns were dreadfully undercooked and nasty.  I asked for coffee when we ordered and did not get it until I was almost completely done eating.  The eggs were like little yellow bricks.  The owner/manager stands at the front with a scowl on his face and just doesn't look pleasant at all.    The only positives were we got seated very quickly and the waitress was very nice and pleasant.  Other than that, just not good.  If ever in the area again, I would not go back."}
{"text":"Very good food but crabby service and our waitress had a terrible unfriendly attitude. My friends had a skillet and an omelette, and since I wasn't very hungry all I ordered was half a grapefruit. Our waitress seemed to lighten up after a while but at first she was crabby as hell and she noticed that I caught the rude silly face that she made when she asked me what I wanted to order...so all from there was a little better. We kindly asked for lemons for our water and it took forever for her to bring them...like 10 minutes....not all that of a big deal but irritating nonetheless...  The interior is very open and airy and the staff at the entrance was very warm and welcoming. The menu is huge and the prices are definitely not the lowest in town but it was packed so I imagine that is a good sign. Most likely to return under different circumstances and hopefully better overall service."}
{"text":"I always get the names of US Egg and The Good Egg mixed up. The food, however, is not to be confused. US Egg is a step above the quickly served breakfast diner style of Good Egg. If you go on weekend, expect a wait. They have a pretty quick turnover, so it's nothing painful. US Egg is filled with a mix of families and Scottsdale-ites decked out in oversized sunglasses and dresses and affliction t-shirts from the night before.   I wish I lived closer so I could visit more often and enjoy those famous protein pancakes. I was expecting healthy with an element of bland and chalky... completely wrong. They have a great grainy texture and a delicious cinnamon flavor."}
{"text":"Update:  My card was billed (even though they said it was declined!)  But they did send a credit."}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes, I would suggest sharing a few items. Everything was delicious and the service was quick. We had the protein pancakes and a skillet and everything tasted fresh and delicious, we just couldn't finish it! (I also love that they had almond milk for my coffee!)"}
{"text":"About as good as a  breakfast place can get.  Good food, good service, clean and friendly atmosphere.  I will most definitely visit again next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, awesome atmosphere.  I'm from Oregon, but I will definitely go back to US Egg when I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This is the sixth and newest location for US Egg, an Arizona based restaurant concept. Six locations? Do we now call it a chain? Hard to say. This location is nicely done, a bit larger inside than what I expected based on the exterior. With Butterfield's located a couple of blocks to the East and Eggstasy located a couple of blocks to the West, this stretch of Shea Boulevard may become a destination for breakfast lovers. It could be a competitive challenge for this newcomer, but it will be nice to have a new alternative when the lines are out the door elsewhere.  The protein pancakes are US Egg's greatest strength. Filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds, it's a bit of a stretch to think they're really that healthy, but they are certainly delicious. The \"Half and Half\" is a great way to order the pancakes and to sample some of the rest of the menu. You receive two small protein pancakes, an egg and a half sized hot skillet. We also ordered some whole wheat pancakes, US Egg's standard pancake, on this day. I'm sure they were better for me than some fluffy buttermilk pancakes I could order elsewhere, but they are forgettable. Stick with the protein pancakes!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating at US Egg on a recent trip to Scottsdale.  Wanted to try to Protein Pancakes, so I had the Half and Half.  Wasn't disappointed.  Would order them again.  Service was good, coffee plentiful and good.  Will go back when we return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and will continue to do so. It first started with their famous protein pancakes! It's a great location, always get seated quickly even on busy weekends.  The best part about US EGG is the very polite staff. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg is situated directly across the street from Denny's.  A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however.  Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes.  If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast, and had the chicken fried steak.  The menu had a lot to choose from and the restaurant was spacious.  Parking is readily available.  A good family restaurant.  The service was quick."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning. The food was delicious and the coffee was hot and fresh.   George one of the brothers, made us feel like family.  He had great menu suggestions as it was our first time in.  Carrie was an excellent server. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes are absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and prompt. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The hash browns were like cubed french fries. I liked them. The food was good. There was a slice of an orange on my plate. I thought it was a garnish of some sort or was to be used to squirt the juice on the food but she told me to eat it. I thought it was weird to have just one slice of orange and grapefruit on a plate. They give patrons a pitcher of coffee to drink even if you order only one cup. I gave myself 3 refills. There was a little tray of cream to get the coffee on track. The breakfast sandwich was about the same as it would anywhere else. Breakfast food is hard to mess up. The waitress was solid and I thought this place was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Sat there for 10min. No one talked to us, looked our way, acknowledged us, so we walked out! Won't be back! Was not even busy!!  Let the girl know at front and she was just like \"oh sorry\" didn't really care either!  Guess trying something new was not worth it and guess the servers don't like to make money on good paying/tipping customers!!"}
{"text":"It's breakfast... Done well. How does anyone not like breakfast food!  US Egg does breakfast really well. And they have creative menu items too. I love their protein pancake. And they have some really crazy skillets that literally have everything in one dish. Biscuits and gravy, hash towns, and a chicken fried steak all stacked on top of each other. Is it healthy? Absolutely not. Is it awesome? Heck yes."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes....get half order...special protein waffle...both really good.  I thought service was fine for a breakfast joint. I would encourage one of the owners who seated us to smile once in a while because he looked mean and or pissed off.  On the other hand, they were getting rid of their silk plants (which I hate in any restaurant) for some other decor...good on ya.  I will return for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Pros - delicious protein pancakes  Cons - coffee was weak, Cajun skillet lacked boldness associated with Cajun food (chicken was not spiced), waffles were soft  I prefer Good Egg for their egg benedicts or Butterfields for their doughy goods, but I have to admit the protein pancake at US Egg, traditionally dry elsewhere, was super delicious with plenty of blueberries and granola."}
{"text":"I really wanted to go to Over Easy when I was near Phoenix (saw it on Drivers, Drive Ins and Dives) but was really disappointed when I found out they closed at 1130..I mean, wtf!  However, I'm very very happy that we didn't go to Over Easy because this place probably is so much better!  When my friends and I went here on a Sunday morning, surprisingly it was not that crowded.  We were seated right away and I was very pleased.  But, when I looked at my nasty dirty cup for water, I was like..ewww.  What else do they not clean???  Luckily for them, their food was bomb.  I got the Veggie Frittata plate.  Their servings are huge and I was pretty full even before halfway of my food being eaten.  The prices were okay, regular breakfast place prices...about $8 per plate?  There were a lot of things to chose from so that's always a plus.  By the end of my meal I was like, what dirty cup???"}
{"text":"They turn my Saturday into a happy Saturday. There was a line when I went there, I have waited about 2 mins then seated. Employees are cheerful and kind.   I have tried Idaho skillets and that was great. The only thing is I like to eat my breakfast with bread like food. They served English muffin but the muffin was small I think. Other than that, everything was great"}
{"text":"This is a very well run restaurant.  The attention provided to our table was impressive.  The food was very good, nice hash browns.  We had a cheese omelet, which honestly tasted better than cheese omelets normally do.  The other main dish was the Arizona Fritatte.  It was exceptional, worth going back just for that!  The service was excellent, the prices lower than most breakfast places.  Will try it for lunch sometime, also.  And, on Sunday at 10:00 am there was no wait."}
{"text":"5 out of 5!! Food was delicious! Eggs cooked perfectly and to cap it off the service was flawless!   Highly recommended, will not disappoint!  Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"The more I come here the more consistent the great service is. I just came back to update my review from 4 stars to 5 because the staff and food deserves it."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. I've been going to the US Egg in Tempe and Scottsdale for years.    I'm not sure if I caught Scottsdale on a bad day or not but this weeks experience was awful. Genuinely unfriendly hostess, mediocre service and I had to send back the food (something I've done less than three times in my life).  I really doubt I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast. Nice area. Friendly, professional, good wait staff. But $2.69 for coffee? That's more than Starbucks. And this coffee is worse than what they serve on airlines."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here after a night at the casino. Really happy with the food, got the blueberry oatmeal pancakes and they were delicious. Husband got the skillet and it was just as good. Kind of pricey for breakfast but excellent food and service. Will return back to this place."}
{"text":"Second time here on my travels.  You cannot go wrong with this place that has southwest flavor for its meals.  Swapped out fruit for breakfast which was LARGE plate of fresh fruit.  Very nice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived for breakfast at about 8AM. The service started off fine.  We ordered our food and it came out in about 2 minutes, eggs over medium with ham and I got the breakfast burrito.  Great, but it made us wonder if it was pre-made, sitting under a heat lamp.  Then we got the answer.  My wife's eggs over medium were over cooked.  One egg yolk was solid, no run.  We asked for the eggs to be made again.  Once again the eggs came out in less then 2 minutes and they were the same, over cooked.  My wife asked for them to be taken away.  The bill came and there was no discount for the poorly cooked eggs.  When I noted this to the waitress, she said she thought the Manager had taken it off.  The Manager then came over and said she would take $2.50 off for the eggs my wife didn't like.  The waitress was then very surly and was tipped accordingly.   I think they pre-make a lot of food to get ready for the rush.  We are never going to this US Egg again."}
{"text":"The menu is too overwhelming and the food isn't all that great. Comparable to a Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Best Chicken n' Waffles I've ever had!  I get it with eggs sunny side up.  I let the yoke run wild to complement the protein waffle, fried chicken, ketchup, syrup, hot sauce and the dish turns into one conglomerate of deliciousness.  Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but the mixture is incredible!  I don't know anything about the drinks because I get water so I don't get a heart-attack from this sugar and good cholesterol overload.  I don't eat anything after this for another 6 or 7 hours."}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so good. Was happy they had biscuits.  Didn't have to wait,   which is great, but do think they need to understand customer service better."}
{"text":"Had their Half-n-half, two protein pancakes, and a half order of their Sante Fe Skillet.  Pancakes are the best I've ever had, whole grain, granola, almonds and blueberries. They are light and fluffy despite all the ingredients!! The Skillet had hash browns, diced chicken, chorizo, tomatoes, onions and a thick green chile sauce with a scrambled egg on top. All the ingredients tasted fresh. Waitress brought me my own pitcher of water and a caraffe of delicious coffee.   Can't think of a better place for breakfast. Fast service and delicious!! Walked out the door for $13."}
{"text":"The US Egg is my weekend breakfast stop. It's a rare weekend that I don't eat there at least once. My go-to breakfast would be a half order of protein pancakes (a full order is two pancakes and they're HUGE) with bananas and blueberries and a side order of scrambled eggs. I'm also a big fan of the breakfast burrito (without meat). It comes with eggs, potatoes, veggies, cheese and salsa. It's big enough to split into two meals, or to share with your friends. In fact, most of the meals at US Egg are large enough to share, and at a cost of $0.99 an egg, I like to add a side of scrambled eggs to make sure everyone leaves with a full belly!  One potential mis-step is that their menu appears to limit the available options. Most meals can be completely customized (sub meat for veggies, sub chicken for sausage, etc...). The possibilities are endless.  There's also a great patio which is perfect on a quiet Sunday morning when cars aren't speeding down Scottsdale Road yet."}
{"text":"We arrived at US Egg on St. Patrick's Day at 10:00 am before the A's vs. Giants Spring Training game and only had a wait of 15 minutes. Not bad to start! Promptly seated we were brought a pitcher of water and ordered our breakfast. The Denver Scramble is delicious! My husband ordered the Hash & eggs - reasonably priced, quick service and a ton of food to start your long days off right!"}
{"text":"I went here recently when some family was in town visiting. Nothing spectacular but impressive enough to warrant a review. I don't remember what I got, an omelet of some kind with toast or something and some coffee. The coffee was good and fresh, enough so that it stood out to me. The food was very edible. Not knock your socks off or anything but if you got picky eaters or people that have bland pallets then you should check this spot out."}
{"text":"I just love it here. Brittani was my server today and everything came fast, fresh and perfect. I got the half n half, which is a half skillet of your choice with 2 nice size protein pancakes. I was by myself and my bill (I got a hot tea and side of sausage) was 27.00 with tip which is a little high for breakfast but I just love this place.   Its always clean, comfortable and fast. I always have great service as well. A female manager came by and asked how things were, which I love!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and actually pretty good. Restaurant is large so you're seated pretty quickly. The food is pretty average. The eggs are fine; hashbrowns are very boring and dry. The bacon is pretty good, but not crispy. Whole wheat pancakes are pretty good, too. Honestly, the food is reminiscent of IHOP, but less greasy/a little better quality.  I don't know if I'd come back, but I wouldn't necessarily shy away either. Overall, 3 stars/A-OK is very accurate."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes with granola and cinnamon we're amazing. If you order the half and half it is pretty small and you will still be a little hungry I bet."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  They have almond milk or skim for coffee. Winning!! lol. Grill their potatoes and have a friendly staff. When staying at the courtyard in old town this will be my pick to start the day.  I hear the protein pancakes are good but didn't get to try them. Large selection on there breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I have driven by US Eggs several times on my way in or out of Old Town Scottsdale.  US Eggs has to have one of the tallest buildings I have ever seen for a restaurant.  One morning, I decided to give it a shot.  I did a little research on Yelp, and I saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes.  I eat quite a bit of protein supplements, so I was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter.  It actually has fresh blueberries, cinnamon, and almonds.  I think the batter had whole grain wheat.  I decided to go with the half and half, which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes (humongous) and an Idaho Skillet that came with potatoes, your choice of 1 egg, and a type of sauce such as Cajun spices, Santa Fe, or various other assortments.  Each of my friends got the same dish, but with different skillet sauces.  We enjoyed the Cajun, Santa Fe, and chicken avocado.  The best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money's worth.  If you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry, come to US Eggs for a power-packed breakfast."}
{"text":"This one is a solid 3. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our protein pancakes and scramble just as much as the next Joe...but we haven't been back to US Egg since we went a few months ago, and you're talking to two of the biggest breakfast fans out there. If your looking for a safe, tried and true breakfast place that won't let you down, but won't blow your socks off either, then give Us Egg a shot. They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu, but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have. I mean, even there name is so generic and blah..US Egg... how original is that? I think this is definitely a few steps above Denny's, but being a step or two above Denny's is not a very hard thing to accomplish. They should maybe start striving to be a few steps above Denny's and then maybe it will be worth making a second trip back."}
{"text":"We got there and the service was not very nice our server was not putting out a good vibe. It took us 40 minutes just to get out food we were very disappointed the food was good but not worth the 40 minute wait. If your willing to wait you would like it, I took my family here to impress them but was not pleased that it took them that long to get the food when there was a small amount of people there too."}
{"text":"I ate here on consecutive days early in the morning.  US Egg opens at 6:30 AM.  The charming hostess cheerfully greeted me the first day and the owner greeted me the next day.  I ordered the wonderful french toast the first day and was greeted with the wonderful smell of cinnamon on top of the perfectly prepared breakfast.  The hostess and the waitress came by to check to see how I was doing.  I ordered the traditional breakfast the next day consisting of two eggs over easy, four sausages, potatoes and an English muffin.    I will come here again, maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"Oh my it's hot in Scottsdale!!!!  Had a great flight and now time to feed my breakfast crave.    My hotel was across the street from US EGG and from the looks it seemed like a nice place to check out.  The staff was friendly (super friendly). I got the vibe that this was the spot for locals to discuss about work, family, and politics (the convos I overheard ).  Anyway, my review, the food was average, mediocre, but good.  Don't expect to be blown away by the food.  You get a good portion for what you pay for.  I had the protein pancakes, eggs, and hash browns.  Coffee was \"eh\" average coffee.    Next time I'm in PHX would I eat there???  Unfortunately, probably not. I believe there are some better places to eat in old town Scottsdale.    Overall... Average with good service and a clean restaurant. B-"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Good food.  Some times you feel like, if you could have double the tummy you could order the same dish and have it again and again. The best pan cakes. The best veggie burger."}
{"text":"Yummers! So many great breakfast choices, good portions, and decent prices. I like how you can customize their breakfast items to get exactly what you're craving. Be sure to try their protein pancakes! I've always enjoyed excellent service too."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg. I've taken people here who I loved. I've taken people here who I didn't like very much. I've met people here at 7 a.m. ish for a ride home after a night of drinking and having passed out inside a friend's hotel room.  The food is just a teensy bit better than standard breakfast fare.  The portions are large.  But the part I love about U.S. Egg is the consistently friendly service.  In fact, one morning a server insisted on buying one of her regulars breakfast.  I eaves-dropped on the entire conversation because 1.) I am nosy and 2.) I was fascinated.    I do love their turkey sausage here for some reason.  But the real reason I come to U.S. Egg is its location.  It is the best place to go when I am on my way OUT of Old Town.    U.S. Egg, I will be seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place, really friendly and attentive service.  Good menu for vegetarians.  The veggie Benedict was really good.  Maybe needed a bit of salt and hot sauce.  :)"}
{"text":"Went to many US Egg locations before and was reeled in by a mailer advertising the opening with a $10 off coupon.  As we walked in the restaurant is decorated very nice and we sat toward the back. The restaurant is shaped kind of in a triangle with a nice patio for great spring mornings.  We ordered Corn Beef Hash, Spinach and Mushroom Omelette and Triple Play Breakfast  Plates.  The portions were generous, the Corn Beef Hash was prepared well but I like it with a little crust but was good. It also came with hash browns which could have been a little bit more crisp to my preference. I don't like asking because I don't want it to be over cooked or burnt.  The triple play was a basic eggs, sausage and pancakes which were also good size portions.   The omelette with mushrooms and spinach was generous and completely made to order with Egg whites only. They did a good job preparing everything as requested.  Very nice place and always looking for new breakfast places to eat.  Will keep US Egg in mind and certainly come back again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. I love their consistency. It's nice that the owners recognize you, shake your hand, and thank you for coming in. Weekend mornings look like there will be a long wait but they are very efficient, even with 30 people outside it normally doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to be sat. The food comes out quickly as well so it's always a pleasant experience.  I recommend the 1/2 and 1/2 with a scramble and protein pancakes. Hits the spot every time and plenty of food to leave full."}
