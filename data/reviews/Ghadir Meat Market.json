{"text":"Chicken skewers and ground beef skewers are  money.  Really good value.  Garlic saufe is like crack sauce."}
{"text":"This is the best beef shwarma I've had in a while. Friendly staff. Affordable lunch. There are even a few tables to sit at. And, when you are finished your lunch you can go to the meat counter in the store and get buy your meat for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I wish I found Ghadir's sooner! I eat a lot of shwarma.
The rice was perfect, hummus was perfect and the  chicken was perfect too. I think the garlic stole the show. Garlic is my favourite addition to a shwarma plate and I am speechless to how incredible Ghadir's garlic is. It wasn't a liquidy artificial sauce like most places have. If you're looking for a great shwarma plate in Scarborough, this is it."}
{"text":"i went to have lunch today. i tried the ghadir plate (1 sandwich) with beef. i should have taken a picture, but i was too excited to dig in--but there are pics in the gallery. it was delicious! very filling and very tasty. 
you can sit inside and they even had a few tables outside (who knew i'd be able to eat outside in october!).
the staff were all pleasant, as well. i'll be back."}
{"text":"I am sure there are many other shawarma joints in the city better then this. Altanoor on this same street is way better. The plate looks big but is mostly occupied with rice and lettuce. Nothing go great about this place."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food in the city. Plus the service was incredible. They gave us so many complimentary dishes and were super helpful. So so so good!"}
{"text":"Part supermarket, part butcher and part takeout & (smallish) sit down schwarma place.

This place is across the street from superb schwarma empire and holds its own. Options are more here (kibbeh, tawook etc.), and the schwarmas have distinctly different tastes & textures. 

Pay at the cashier and then go to schwarma counter to place your order. 

Prices are great and service is friendly. Had both the chicken and beef schwarma. 

First heard abt this place at a New York Times event on Syrian food & culture in TO. Subsequently, also read Doss' review as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Ghadir after seeing it on blogTo. The place is a meat shop and restaurant so it was no surprise that the bbq was so fresh. Tried the bbq platter, they served it just like how it's shown on tv. They were juicy and flavorful. Also the chicken bbq tasted phenomenal! For the prices, Ghadir is a must try for some good food. Happy to find a good Lebanese shawarma place in Scarborough. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Butcher shop is located inside as well as their \"restaurant\". Everything is made in house! Fresh shawarma meat, sauces, toppings"}
{"text":"Ordered from Ghadir's using Uber Eats and was pleasantly surprised. Took a while to get the order, but to me, it is usually a sign of food being cooked properly from scratch.

Chicken kabobs were very flavourful  and tasty. The rice and the pickled vegetables were decent as well. I wish they had some healthier choices for sides as opposed to the usual pop/fries/white rice variety.

Will be ordering again from them in the future. This is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"For a little place like this, I'm certainly impressed with the service I've received. I've been here three times now. Every person I've spoken to who works here is incredibly friendly and super helpful. 

I will second Anna V's comment about their beef shawarma. It is the beefiest tasting shawarma I've ever had. Ali (one of the owners, I believe) informed me that they do their shawarma the way they do it back at home, where they don't stuff the sandwich full of veggies and other things. Instead, they let the flavor of the meat shine through. That being said, if you want veggies in your shawarma, they'll do it for you as well. I'm fine with my veggies being on the side. This was good the way it was. 

The other day when I came, I ordered one of of their Ghadir plates, which includes 2 shawarma sandwiches, fries or rice, mixed pickles, and salad for $14.99. I also ordered their beef kafta plate ($10.99), which includes 2 skewers of kafta, rice or fries, salad, mixed pickles, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita. This was intended to feed 3 people. We ended up having about a third of it left. Part of this was because I was asked if I wanted rice or fries, and I said both. I was assuming that my kafta plate would have one, and my Ghadir plate would have the other. When I opened my 3 takeout boxes, I discovered that my kafta plate had rice, one box of my Ghadir plate had fries, and the other box of my Ghadir plate had both fries and rice. Huh. 

Their rice looks like it's curry flavored. It's good, but I prefer the fries, especially because of their hummus and their garlic sauce. Both are delicious. Fries in hummus and garlic sauce. Mmmm. Just bring breath mints. 

The kafta was tender and seasoned quite nicely. They have BBQ platters intended for families to share. Next time, I'm getting one of those. They've got things like 10 kafta skewers, hummus, pickles, and and pitas for $29.99. They've also got a whole BBQ chicken with garlic sauce, pickles, and pita for $14.99. For an additional $5, they'll add 3 cans of pop and a choice of large rice or fries to that BBQ chicken meal. I sound like I'm advertising. I'm not. I'm just excited to eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the great places to eat good Lebanese grills and shawerma.
I tried their Shawerma plate, and their Shish Tawouk (chicken cubes skewers) and they are both great. Their Fries are also great - which is rare to find for a shawerma place!

Only thing needs to be fixed: Fattouch and Tabouleh - but this is a fast food Lebanese, so shouldnt judge for the salads much."}
{"text":"Update: Just had their Shawarma yesterday and it's the best(most authentic) Chicken Shawarma I have after i left Saudi. They make it exactly like middle-east, or as they call it \"Old School\".
Beef shawarma was made differently so it didn't taste as good, next time i would ask them to put the same toppings in beef Shawarma as chicken and see.

---------------------------------------------------
This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!

I can't speak for the shawarma here as I havent had it yet, however, They have WHOLE BBQ CHICKEN for just $14is plus tax!!! not just that, it comes with 3 PITAS, garlic sauce and some pickles,
It was cooked to perfection, tasted amazing and had best garlic sauce I have had in Canada.

Now, whenever we are making pizza/pasta etc, and don't feel like making the chicken, we just do a takeaway here. Can't go wrong in such a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I heard of Ghadir from listening to Suresh Doss's weekly Thursday food report on CBC's Metro Morning*, which honestly is a great source of learning about interesting places and hidden multicultural gems all over the GTA, and much more open-minded and insightful than, say, the empty and airheaded reviews from BlogTO. If you are into hearing about the people and stories behind the businesses--like how Ghadir grew into a community and makes efforts to hire Syrian immigrants/refugees that could use the opportunity--then consuming Doss' weekly column is definitely worthwhile.

Anyways, Ghadir at first appearance may seem like just another Lebanese place in a sea of Middle Eastern and Indian strip plaza food establishments along this segment of Lawrence East. (Wexford, Scarborough is quickly becoming a booming yet overlooked hotspot for such cuisine in Toronto) It began as a mere halal butchery across the street, but now at the NE corner of Lawrence and Pharmacy, they expanded to include a grocery store of imported goods, and a quick-serve restaurant/takeout joint. There is a separate dining room and a tiny patio area by the parking lot. If you are here to eat, order and pay at the cashier first before heading to the food counter.

The Lebanese style shawarma comes highly rated (heck, to BlogTO's credit they consider it one of the best in the city). From what I seen with their other meals, you get quite a lot for the price; heck the shawarma wraps themselves are big. The chicken shawarma I had was pleasant with nicely cooked, flavourful meat, a decent dosage of stuffing, and that garlic sauce. 

It's quite a community scene in here, as scores of regulars are here eating and socializing together. You practically feel like you're in Beirut, rather than Scarborough.

{TTC: 54 or 67 bus to Lawrence and Pharmacy Aves}

{"text":"Ventured out to this Lebanese meatery after reading an article by Suresh Doss...I ordered chicken shawarma in a pita with everything on it, and it was tasty. Didn't blow me away, mind you, but I enjoyed it. Next time I'd probably go for extra garlic sauce and pickles because I'm just that type of gal...but honestly, not sure if there'll be a next time because for my tastes, it just wasn't so ay yai yai. Anyway, the place was super busy so it's definitely worth a shot so you can decide for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Middle Eastern food. Great beef shawarma, and they press it so that the pita is crispy and then slice it up into pieces rather than eating it as a whole sandwich.  Their babaganouj is delicious and flavourful.  A small is enough for a 2-4 people if you're ordering other stuff.  We ended up getting the large and had to bring most of it home, although it was great in a salad the next day! 

You get a huge quantity of food for what you pay for, and I'd definitely come back here again, probably for takeout as they don't have much space for seating. It's half restaurant/takeout and half grocery store.  It gets quite busy even on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, and definitely the best Arab food I have tried outside of the middle east. Their shawarma is amazing, and made just the way you would find it back home, stuffed with French Fries, pickles, garlic sauce etc. Speaking of the garlic sauce, it really is the best I have tried in Toronto to date. If that wasn't enough, they also have a spicy garlic sauce, who else does that?!?! In addition, the whole grilled chicken is also amazing, perfectly cooked, tender and juicy on the inside. 

Skip the kebabs, as the star's here are definitely the chicken, the shawarma, and of course, the garlic sauce!"}
