{"text":"Loved it! Food was delicious. Had bread and cheese board, olives, and shrimp and grits. Signature drinks were delicious. Going back for a second visit tomorrow. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I would definitely order the Shishito peppers, we ordered ours without the chorizo though since we don't eat meat."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been to Tres several times. The service has always been great. The menu is very diverse with options different from most places in Tempe. We love their calamari. I just discovered their never ending Bellini for Sunday brunch. Need I say more.  Rachel at the bar is quickly become our favorite. She's friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I am in Tempe on business and I stay at different Hilton properties almost every time I am here.   I think I found my spot at the Hilton Garden ASU Research Area for the simple fact it is connected to Tres.  What a great bar, menu and staff.  Great beers on tap and craft cocktails.  I really enjoyed my food, beverage and conversing with the staff.  Ashley and Charles are killer bartenders!!  Stop by and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Love the decor and feel of the place. The interior design is tasteful and modern - I just wish it was a bit cooler so we could sit outside! Not much they can do when they're in Arizona (read: surface of the sun).   The service was prompt and friendly. I loved that the style was a combo of tapas, entrees, and big plates. The pork flatbread blew my mind. Everything else was great too, but that dish was a step above the rest. Will definitely be back when I am in AZ again."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates are to die for. Everything I have tried here so far has been great! This place is a little pricier for food, but I honestly don't mind spending a little more because the food is excellent. Ashley the day bartender is very friendly :)  Rooting for this place!!!"}
{"text":"Tres chic decor but very noisy...too loud to have a quiet conversation across the table. We went for a Sunday afternoon brew but were disappointed in their rather limited tap selection."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and this popped up on Yelp so we thought we would try it. When we pulled up we were a little suspect because there was no one around and it was attached to a midpoint hotel. I'm glad we went in and tried it because the food was delicious. I really like the ambience of the restaurant as well. The dishes were interesting with strong flavor. Kind and attentive service."}
{"text":"The newly opened Tres Tempe bills itself as a Mediterranean/Southwest fusion spot.  It is attached to the Hilton located between Guadalupe and Elliot on price.  The dark metal, black stone, and warm wood interior create a warm contemporary feel.  There's a semi open kitchen and a spacious bar in the main restaurant.  There's also a nice patio/beer garden with an additional bar, several tables, TVs, and games like bags.   All the staff is friendly and happy to answer questions and the service was good. For the month of March (2018), happy hour is all day with deals on several small plates and $4 drafts. Small plates run  $6-14, medium $12-$30, large (shared by 2-4 people) $59-69.  The draft list is small, but local with good options.  We didn't venture into the cocktail or wine list on this visit.   We ordered the papa bravas, chickpea fritto misto, and crunchy shrimp lettuce wraps.   The problem with fusion, in my opinion anyhow, is that sometimes the traditional takes are kind of perfect and the \"new\" spin falls flat.  Okay, so I'm really just not a fan of fusion, but I love tapas so I had high hopes. The papa bravas were a perfect example of not messing with perfection. The dish was made with halved fingerling potatoes. They weren't roasted in enough fat and were very dry and bland--a little salt would have gone a long way here.  The menu description didn't seem to apply to what we were served--I'm assuming the harissa sauce was red and the green sauce was some kind of ailoi.  Regardless the balance was off on the dish.  The red sauce was sweet, spicy, and the best thing on the plate.  This was not an improvement on the tapas staple.  The shrimp cups were refreshing, but again the balance seemed off.  I though the shrimp and jicama slaw were tasty, though the shrimp seemed a bit limp and my dining companion complained they were too  \"shrimpy.\"  I felt like it should have been pico or pickled jalapenos--both was a little too acidic. The chickpea fritto misto (veggies battered in chickpea flour) were tasty.  As someone who is not a huge fan of kale, battered and fried it was pretty good.  We both agreed the \"red chili jelly\" (it tasted like spicy sweet and sour) smeared on the plate was much better than the lime crema dipping sauce, which was pretty bland. There was no queso fresco on the plate.  I doubt it would have added much to the flavor, but without it, this was a brown plate that was visually unappealing.  It was still the best thing we ordered. On a whole, we felt like the food was solid, but not exceptional.  Given the prices, we expected more.  Our verdict was that Tres Tempe is a solid happy hour stop, but not a regular dinner spot."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. But I don't. We have been here 5 or 6 times and it is hit and miss. I think definitely more misses than hits. The service is unpredictable. The servers don't have good knowledge of the menu and getting a drink from the bar is always slow. Last time. I was served my dinner before even getting my glass of wine. Also, food often doesn't come as ordered, like as substituted side or no sauce or no onions on the burger. Last night we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, they came out about 2 minutes after we ordered them and they were ice cold. They remade them for us. Then I got the ribeye. It was mediocre at best, not seasoned well and a very, very fatty cut. Tempe really needs places like this, I really wanted to love it, but I am not sure.if it's even worth trying again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fabulous lunch eating experience. It is very quiet for lunch as this is a new restaurant and hidden away with the adjacent Hilton hotels.  We drooled all over the delicious Pork Wings. But the Bacon Wrapped Dates were even better. Wow! We highly recommend choosing the dishes and sharing rather than the entrees per person. There is so much to share and enjoy that we will be back again. Foodies will definitely enjoy this gem...  Oh...and do save room for dessert. Wow!  Many dishes are small portion, beautifully garnished with fantastic flavor! Be sure to ask about the quantity for your specific request. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My bf found this place through a friend who checked in, saw it had great reviews and was close by. We're always up for a new spot to dine. First impression- we were kind of surprised it was attached to a hotel. Not quite sure how much traffic they're getting in this location but the building/layout/decor were all beautifully thought out. Rooting for it to get more attention! I appreciated the modern chic branding style & how it was incorporated throughout.   More importantly- the FOOD did not disappoint! My taste buds were in heaven from the various items on the menu. We went right before Happy Hour was over so we tried a few things on the HH menu in addition to other plates on the menu. The Chef totally got it right! The hummus was so smooth it made us crave for more pita bread; bowl licking good! The AZ Harvest salad was far from boring and had all the delicious toppings I enjoy, specially roasted pistachio! The Crispy Calamari was one the best I've tasted; the aioli sauce drizzled on top totally made this stand out from other calamari dishes I've had. The Chickpea Fritto Misto was fun. We've never had battered fried lemon before! The daily special pork taco was very tasty and filling. Needless to say, we did not have room for dessert, although I would have loved to try some. Definitely next time!  The only disappointing thing about the whole experience would have to be the customer service. We went during an odd time where it was not very busy so there were more staff than customers at one point, yet the only interactions we had was with our waitress, who was awesome, and the hostess who sat us. We didn't really get that friendly, inviting, welcoming vibe. We dine out A LOT and notice that customer service is a huge factor in the overall experience. A simple \"Hi! Welcome!\" or \"Hey, how are you doing?\" as people walk in goes a long way. A man, who we can only assume to be a manager made a point to greet a gentleman who could be a regular but ignored everyone else there. While there was no expectation to be treated with overly fake enthusiasm, we felt it was lacking that friendly, community energy we love about Tempe. It could have been an off day and again, our waitress was great. The food was definitely worth going back for though! I really hope this place does well."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly service!  Amazing appetizers, and strong delicious drinks!  If your lucky enough to live close to the canal you could easily bike here!  Word has it they'll be installing bike stalls soon!  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The atmosphere is new and modern. You can tell they put a lot of work into every detail. We had the calamari, and Brussels sprouts for an appetizer and lettuce cups for a main course. It was plenty of food for two people. I highly recommend this place. South Tempe lacks good good restaurants. So happy this place moved in!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night on the patio. Ordered 5 different small plates plus the wood fired bread. Everything was top notch. Service was excellent. Good bar list and a nice line up of Az beers. Let me say again,  service was excellent. Stand out....the bacon wrapped dates. But the brussel sprouts are a close second. Then again....well everything was excellent.  We are looking forward to trying this place again for happy hour and a weekend brunch.  Come and try....you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"New restaurant, flavorful menu, attentive staff, and a feast for the taste buds. Even though the restaurant is classified as Mediterranean, I do not think any one designation will capture the geographic and ethic diversity of the menu. We asked the server to surprise us with her several choices of favorite small plates.   The tacos, the calamari, the flatbread, and, oh, that heavenly tomato soup made for a mid-day feast. Tres is a must try. You will not be disappointed.   Pictured below was the gelato dessert that sealed the deal."}
{"text":"Proud to say I am the first Yelp review for this up and coming bar/restaurant.  Tied to the Home2Suites by Hilton, this gem offers great appetizers, drinks, food and entertainment.  Great for a business meeting, hot date or watching sports with the guys...  AWESOME FOOD AND SERVICE!  Order the cheeseboard and hummus to start, then try their mixed drinks.  This place will become a very reputable restaurant in the area.  THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY WORTH YOUR TIME, VISIT and MONEY."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to \"Uno\" and \"Dos\" but \"Tres\" time's the charm I say! We came here for their happy hour (Which runs all day until late March) which includes discounted drinks and appetizers.  There was so much on the menu I wanted to try I couldn't decide for the longest time! A lot of the items are a twist on your classic standard version of a certain dish. For instance, their Reuben is actually a Reuben Cuban which is a lovely combination of the best of both sandwich worlds. Pair that with their delicious roasted potatoes and you have yourself a hefty and hearty meal! The lettuce shrimp cups were good as well, but a bit watery. I did enjoy the crisp refreshing flavors and the spicy punch of heat with the sliced chile peppers in it. We shared some shishito peppers too which came out nicely cooked, combined with chorizo, Tajin, and cotija cheese.   I indulged in the happy hour spiced pear sour ($6 during happy hour, normally $12) which was a heavy handed drink both in taste and alcohol. The description for it states it contains Four Roses bourbon, St. George spiced pear liqueur, hand-squeezed lemon juice, and ginger puree. I initially enjoyed the spice combined with the tangy flavor of the lemon+pear, but the more I drank the more I felt like the spice overwhelmed the drink (I think it was maybe clove or cinnamon in it). I couldn't really taste any of the ginger flavor either. I also had the Valdez coffee which was smooth and refreshing, made with cold brew Press Coffee and condensed milk. I thought the coffee price was a bit steep though for what I got, since I didn't detect any shaved chocolate or cinnamon in it.   Service was excellent from our awesome server Ken. He knew the menu and could steer us to good selections that we'd be happy with.   The one thing that might hinder me from coming back is that it got harder to hear people at our table as more people came in to dine. Call me an old fogey but I like to be able to use my indoor voice when I'm at dinner. I did see the very expansive and lovely looking patio which would probably be better in terms of noise level while dining.   I ended up getting the citrus zabaglione with zeppole to go. I enjoyed the frothy light texture of the zabaglione and its custard-like taste combined with the fresh fruit and I absolutely loved the zeppole, with their crispy crunchy outer crust and soft donut-like texture inside.  Overall we had a lovely time chatting and indulging in the unique selections. I'd love to go back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Had lunch here today. The menu is fairly small but well selected and everything looks great. I had the Al Pastor Chicken Torta and it was delicious!!!  The service was great. Very friendly and prompt. The ambiance is also great and it feels very open inside and they also have a nice outside seating area too.   When back in Tempe, I plan to return. :)"}
{"text":"For the price the food wasn't worth it.  wasn't the best brunch I've ever had.  The bellinis were good though. Menu listed 4 different flavors, they only had the blueberry."}
{"text":"A group of 8 went for lunch! Great service and amazing food exceptionally prepared!!! So happy you're in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere for this new restaurant in Tempe!  You will love the feel and environment.  The patio is awesome to hang out with family and friends.  Great food and drinks.  South Tempe needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"A great place.  Start by ordering some small plates and share an entree.    The Ouzo mule was enjoyed.  A nice touch by lighting the rosemary on top.  We started with two small plates of the bacon dates and humus.  Good stuff!  We had the side of skillet bread.  It is almost cake-like.  We shared the lamb sliders.  The were excellent, yet a bit spicy.  Tonight was a solo guitarist singing some random songs.  It does get loud inside.  Outside can be nice, yet shade is minimal.    Staff was 5 star.  Great service.  The manager and others were very attentive and checked on us often."}
{"text":"Tres is a new fusion restaurant & bar in Tempe. We went there for the first time on Saturday evening. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for 6, but we were sat in the bar so that was ok for us.  I was pleasantly surprised by the beer list, there were plenty of local beers to choose from. Please add the abv %age to the beer menu,  the waiter didn't know but he did find out for us when we asked. Service was ok, not exceptional, we had to ask for water glasses which they brought promptly but didn't bring any water until we asked again. My biggest complaint is the decor, sun glaring through the windows on our table , no shades or blinds, so half the table have to wear sunglasses and then it's not enough. Also the acoustics are awful, you can't hold a conversation, there is no sound damping, just incessant loud and harsh background noise. I had the lamb sliders, they were good, not great, a bit over spiced for me. None of the food we tried was exceptional, but we didn't try the $66 paella! I probably won't go back until they get window shades, & because of the noise issue, and I wasn't too impressed with the value."}
{"text":"Trendy, secluded spot tucked in the shadows of the hotels. Nicely decorated. Had the lamb sliders and the Ruben Cuban. Very tasty and great bold flavor on the lamb. The Cuban fell short with wow factor in comparison. It had muted citrus tones with the coleslaw in it but felt like it was missing something. Was disappointed that there are no kid friendly options-/ not even a mention on how to tweak an item for a child's taste. Paid $8 for a soup as an alternative. It's on the pricier side which could deter many working middle class. Not saying it's not good food. It is. But I was hoping for a weekly \"go-to\" place but found it more of a \"special occasion\" place budget wise."}
{"text":"What a refreshing restaurant and menu. We enjoyed the small plate concept which was perfect for 2. What a gem in the East Valley.  We started with Margherita Flatbread, bacon wrapped Mejool dates and Oven fired Queen Creek olives! Our choice for a medium plate to share was spicy Lamb Merguez sliders. Of course I had to try dessert. Everything was wonderful. Our server Chris was great explaining the menu options and sharing his favorites. Mercy we can't thank you enough for your table side hospitality. We were so lucky to meet you (and John). TRES marries the Mediterranean and Southwest flavors bringing delicious plates with eye appealing detail. Kudos!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in a business park.  The restaurant is situated next to the Hilton Garden Inn / Home2 Suites and they share a patio between the 2.  My coworker and I went for lunch and to my surprise it was a bit empty but well staffed.  The staff was excellent and attentive plus the food was great.  As the website says it is a mixture of Mediterranean and Southwest but probably splashed with a bit of Cuban since the meal we had was the Reuben Cuban with a side of fingerling potatoes.  We split the sandwich and added a side of the Calamari.  I'm a big guy but this was definitely enough food for both of us.  The sandwich was very flavorful and the potatoes were done just right as to be a tad firm but not mushy with a pan fried texture.  The Calamari was excellent and my only regret is the sprinkling of the aji amarillo aioli was a wee bit sparse but provided a nice tang to the dish.  This is definitely a place that deserves a return visit and further exploration of the menu.  Kudos and best of luck to Tres."}
{"text":"Fantastic bourbon selection. Food is unique and tasty. Friendly service and is good to go back and try new things!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in the Tempe area. It has only been open for about 5 weeks, so it is not very busy yet, but it will once people find out about it. They serve a nice variety of Mediterranean dishes with some creative combinations like their Chicken al Pastor sandwich, and has an extensive cocktail, beer and wine menu.   As far as the locale itself, their inside dining area is fairly large and has an attractive bar area in the middle of the room, and the outside patio is perfect for happy hour and get together with friends. It has lots of large TVs distributed around the patio, and has an area with games as well.   Food quality was great and service was friendly and fast. Overall, this is definitely a place to try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant while looking for new places in the same zip code as Alamo Draft House. It is perfect spot post movie or anytime for that matter. The menu is a creative spin on mediterranean fare and I loved everything. We got the pork trifecta flatbread, a green salad and the pork wings - wow. Then, as if things couldn't get any better, I had the lamb sliders - a real stand out with mango chutney, spicy aoli and crispy onions. Service was very friendly and attentive - the only thing that would keep this new (opened 3 months) spot from doing extremely well is the off the beaten path location - Price Rd. along the 101 freeway right off of Guadalupe Rd. and adjacent to a hotel. Not a problem for me though - I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. For lunch, dinner and just drinks. This area is missing a place like this, so I could not be more happy about it moving into the neighborhood. First, I'd like to commend the drink menu. The cocktails are varied, exotic, fun, boozey and delicious. The beer menu has a lot of local choices on draft and the list was very well thought through. The food, much like the drinks are varied, fun and flavorful. I've ordered everything from shashito peppers to flat breads to the Reuban Cuban and I have not been disappointed once. The shashtio peppers are a stand out as well as the pork wings and lamb sliders.   The service is a work in progress, not because the servers aren't super friendly (because they are), but because execution and knowledge is still a work in progress. That's typical with a new joint, so I am not going to fault the establishment. The spaces is great both inside and outside. This place is a gem for the neighborhood.   Also, the Happy Hour menu is fantastic. $6 hand crafted cocktails and $4 beers are on point as well as a good selection of decent appetizers."}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp. It's right next to our house yet we didn't know it existed. Apparently it's been open for about 4 months now. I was part of a group of 7 and we all got our own \"medium sized plate.\" Ambience and friendliness of the service was good. Food was also good. Only minor hiccup was from the time we received our first entree to the last took 25 minutes. I will chalk it off as this place is still new and the servers are still learning. Portions are small for the prices. We will be back. I would recommend the Ruben Cuban. See pictures."}
{"text":"The drinks are amazing, main reason I keep coming back, I just wish they had a better menu and choice of appetizers"}
{"text":"There was fire, alcohol, and a parade of food!  I'm loving this place! Maybe it's the Happy Hour or maybe it's because of our awesome waiter Kenneth but I had a great dinner here with some amazing Yelper friends!  I nibbled on Christie S.'s (super happy to have finally met my favorite Vegas-transplanted Yelper!) Asparagus with Pumpkin Seed Romesco, devoured some Blistered Shishito Peppers, destroyed the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates, tried a bit of the perfectly-cooked and juicy The Tres Burger, and annihilated my dish of the Spicy Lamb Merguez Sliders. I'm absolutely crazy about shishito peppers so they were great but the bacon wrapped dates and the lamb sliders were my favorites. The dates are super rich and flavorful and the lamb sliders are a spice lover's dream. The Merguez sausage reminds me a lot of chorizo and I'm here for it, babie! I need the mango chutney they used for my toast at home too. Yum.  I also had a Pineapple Hibiscus Cooler and a Blueberry Ouzo Mule to wash everything down. Their cocktails are worth mentioning in their own paragraph because while I don't think they're advertised as a cocktail parlor, they make a pretty dreamy cocktail. The Cooler was really tequila-forward which is good for tequila lovers! I usually like my tequila hidden away behind a filler so I ended up pawning it off and got a Blueberry Ouzo Mule instead. Kenneth came by with a lighter, made the fiyah dance against a sprig of rosemary, and the table went wild. The smoky rosemary paired well with the anise-flavored Ouzo and the ginger beer. And who doesn't love blueberry puree? I honestly think I'd be back just to order the mule.  All in all, I'm impressed with their Happy Hour offerings and the menu is diverse and plentiful without being too overwhelming. TRES is a stand-alone building next to the hotel and it is gorgeously decorated. Those giant windows need to be on my house! I want to go back to TRES already!"}
