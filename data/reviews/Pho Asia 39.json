{"text":"I had Delivery from these guys and the food was delicious!
I ordered:
Shrimp Fresh Rolls (came with a yummy sweet peanut dipping sauce),
Pho: Chiken Rice Noodle Soup (regular), 
Pho:Well Done Beef & Beef Tendon Rice Noodle (regular),
Avocado Fruitshake (soo good!). 
Food was delivered at a decent time, still hot, and my Fruitshake was ice cold and in one piece. 

I will definitely order from here again! :-D"}
{"text":"So disappointing. Been there twice now.The food was not fresh. I love pho and eat it every week but this place was gross. Just joined yelp to find a good spot. This place had the worse service ever....guy was on his phone the whole time and messed up my 2 item order. seriously, how do you screw up #15 and #44??!!!! The shrimp on sugar cane was good, though.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Im no expert on pho, but I have been here a couple of times, and the pho with rare beef is outstanding.  Throw all the fixings right in there and your taste buds will experience all types of flavours!"}
{"text":"Customer service was unbelievably rude. I would rate them 0.5 star if that option existed. I only rated them 2 stars for their decent food. I am Vietnamese. I do understand every word they were saying about me behind the counter. I have spoken Vietnamese to them and they stillll smack talk me out loud. 

So I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee. I like my coffee to be strong and thick with less ice as they already know. But for some reason the owner diluted it with water and added tons of ice to it to make it look fuller. 

At this point I wasn't impressed. It tasted like water. I asked them to redo it and it still wasn't right. I do live in the area and I wanted this to be my go to restaurant however I will not be coming back. I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"First time trying out this restaurant and it was pretty good, satisfied my expectations of a Vietnamese restaurant with competitive offerings.  There's a nice variety in the menu, from the classic Pho to various noodle soups, rice, fried noodles and shakes.  I was happy with my Pho special, dinner companions were pretty pleased too.  Only comment is my fruit shake was a bit too diluted and could have used a bit more fresh fruit substance.  Overall, a convenient stop for a quick bite, we would dine here again."}
{"text":"After my not so \"wonder pho\" debacle...  My pho is here before I could even create this business profile."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good until they switched management last year.  They have repeated disappointed me the last 6 times I've visited here under their new owner.

1) They don't deliver although their website says otherwise

2) I ordered Bun Rieu take-out and they gave me Bun Bo Hue but it was my fault I didn't check leaving the restaurant until I got home and realized but it was too much of a hassle to go back and get it right

3) I ordered again Bun Rieu take-out and they AGAIN gave me Bun Bo Hue...

4) We came here and dined in and I ordered Bun Rieu and was informed me they no longer have that item and suggested Bun Bo Hue to me....OH THAT MAKES SENSE NOW.  I can surely speculate that my previous two incorrect orders were in fact intentional.

5) I ordered satay beef with vermicelli and my bowl was literally slices of beef stir fried in Chinese hoisin sauce and slopped on with peanuts with a whole bunch of vegetables such as broccoli, onions, spoiled carrots...

6) I ordered take-out tonight of beef and grilled meat balls with vermicelli and got home and opened the F*CKING box and it's missing the meat balls.

I'm F*CKING done with this restaurant.  Do not come here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now to grab my usual order of pho #11.  I havent tried anything else on the menu, but for what I do order, its great.  Love it!
The people working here are always kind and courteous"}
{"text":"Doesn't do delivery even though it says it on a sign. Portions are getting smaller and prices are raising strangely. Used to be a good spot but now it's just a place to go get some last minute food when you have nowhere else to go. Save your money and try something bet"}
{"text":"Good dish. Very authentic. Basic dish. Inside was clean and staff was very friendly. Professional, good price. Worth a run. Could be a bit better or higher quality. Good!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food overall just ok at 6-7/10 rating. We tried their Bun Bo Hue which was not that great or authentic and missing other meat items that is supposed to be in this dish. The way they made the beef is weird. We would not order this here again. The Vermecelli Chicken & Pork (Bun Thich Nuong Ga Nuong) was better than Bun Bo Hue. Decent portions and prices. Good to try once and eat here if its convenient for you but we like the food & portions at Pho Dau Bo at Finch/Weston better. This place was dead with barely any customers when we went this week. Cash only here with ATM machine inside or Scotiabank machine across at 711 store."}
{"text":"I recommend trying this place out, pho broth is clear (less msg and fat) with generous portions of meat. I also normally get the bun with spring rolls & grilled pork meat - big portion! However, fresh rolls are a bit dry and lacking, only get it if you're really itching!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic vietnamese pho. Fantastic customer service. Very big portions. Very cheap. Worth every penny. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Low quality pho. Spring rolls are too greasy, the soup is nothing special and when I ordered the chicken and rice.. They left a huge chuck of fat on it.. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Convenient pho place. Whenever I want something fast and decent I would come here with family or the boyfriend. The food is made pretty fast so I can come here on my 1 hour lunch breaks with friends. The pho isn't the best I have ever had but it's decent to come often. Sometimes in dishes such as the pork chop or chicken rice, it lacks the meat, or the cut may be not as good. The grilled freash rolls are great. Overall, decent close place to travel to (excluding the type of area)."}
{"text":"Garbage, they give you fake imitation Crab meat. They don't have the correct noodles. Their soup is horrible. Don't waste your time and money."}
