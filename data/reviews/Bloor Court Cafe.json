{"text":"What a great little place! The staff are so friendly! They seem to know all the regulars names and orders too. The atmosphere is really relaxed, great place to get some studying in. The food and drinks are quite cheap and good quality. And to top it all off refills of drip coffee are only $1!"}
{"text":"A  great little friendly coffee shop, were you can sit for an hour or two with a book or a friend, and not have to worry about anyone giving you the evil eye."}
{"text":"My favourite little cafe in the neighbourhood. Solid offerings, zero pretension and friendly service.
Note that the Bloorcourt Cafe of today offers both espresso based drinks, and reasonably priced drip coffee. Best of all though - the tasty grab and go home-made breakfast goods."}
{"text":"This place is convenient and the owner is really nice but I ordered a soy latte and it  tasted like dish water...maybe it's the soy milk they used but I don't know I wouldn't get coffee here again"}
{"text":"This little cafe leaves a lot to be desired. It's stuck around even as Bakerbots and Arte Gelato opened up on the same corner. Both retail espresso drinks, but Bloorcourt does not.  It's niche is being open early in the morning for the simple coffee-type crowd. Kind of like an independent Tim Horton's. I used to see a woman sitting in the exact same seat there every morning at 8am without fail.

As far as I can tell, nothing they sell is made in house. Catering kitchen style bagels, factory-made large muffins and even the coffee is pre-made and stored in thermoses that just sit on the counter. You pay and then help yourself. I haven't been impressed enough to go there more than a few times, when nothing else was open.

They sell TTC tokens incase the machine is broken in the station. It'll save you a walk to the main entrance."}
{"text":"Bloor Court is great! The service is great and the owner knows everyone by name. A good variety of juices, teas and coffee. She make these little breakfast sandwiches that are really good! A genuine little cafe place with heart."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service.  May, the owner, takes the time to remember everyone's names and order preferences and makes the majority of food items in-house. 

I think they only offer brewed coffee rather than espresso based drinks but I could be wrong as I only drink dip coffee. 

Higher than average coffee shop fair made for easy grab and go.   They have approx 3-4 tables inside and cute patio seating when the weather is up for it."}
{"text":"I'm unsure as to why this place only has 3 stars. Most things are homemade, I've even been in their when the whole place smells of onions because they're cooking one of their delicious soups. The coffee is great, they have a great selection of teas, and the breakfast cookie is actually quite filling and nutritious for the morning. 

My only qualm is that their opening hours are a bit inconsistent. I've gone in there at 7:30 on a Saturday morning to get breakfast but then try again another Saturday at 8am and they're closed.

Overall, their food is great, it's their customer service that could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Great friendly prompt service and the best samosas  in the area. I love the low key vibe of the cafe and the patio is great in the summer. In the winter the cafe is a warm coffee aozy place to grab a coffee on your way to work."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever !! Rude and blames the customer in front of other customers!!!

So I went in today to get a breakfast. I have been here many times but only ever picked up the ready made items. Today I wanted a cheddar bagel with what read on the menu \" lettuce tomatoes and cheese\". I ordered the \" veggie and cheese\" and as more customers came in she rang them up and made their drink order and heated their items while I had to wait for 3 coffees and lattes as I was just standing around. Once she made my bagel she put on a sauce that was just laying out on the counter the entire time. I asked what it was and she said spicy mayo and I said I can't eat mayo. And she said well all the sandwiches come with mayo. And continued to make the sandwich. I had to tell her can you please make a new one without mayo. And she paused didn't look at me in obvious annoyance threw the bagel out kept the toppings that has been on it. And said all the sandwiches come with spicy mayo next time tell me before. I said well it doesn't say it's on the sandwiches on the board anywhere so how am I suppose to guess you will put that on there when it states only \" lettuce tomatoes cucumber and cheese \" and she continued to tell me all of them have it and I need to tell her before and she can't be making new things when all of them have it. And I said this is the first sandwich I ever got here how would I know that. She continues to blame me loudly in front of the customers that I did not tell her before she made it I can't have it and I said it's not on the board why would I tell you ? Then continues to serve other two customers. And gives me the topping that were on the original sandwich without apologizing or anything just being rude and continuing to blame me for the mistake.  Very rude. And I will never be coming back again !"}
{"text":"Cute spot for coffee sandwiches or snacks with great service from the owner/ manager. It's evident that the owner, Mae, really cares about her customers"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located on the way to the Delaware entrance at Ossinington station. They open fairly early and are a great little stop to grab breakfast and a coffee on the run. 
The loaves are pretty good but I really like the Korean egg corn and pea muffins. They have a variety of healthier options like hard boiled eggs and vegan options  (e.g. chia pudding). They usually are stalked with tokens incase the machine is broken at the ttc entrance. That will change now with the Presto pass changes. 
The staff is very friendly and I like watching taking a moment to watch the fishes in the fish tank swim around while waiting in line. 
Don't be afraid to try this place if your need a snack on the run to the ttc."}
