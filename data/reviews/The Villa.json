{"text":"The menu offers a lot of variety, even for those who don't like raw fish. The cooking tables, and chefs are excellent.  A very good value. Try the spicy miso soup. It's not listed any where but if you ask for it they'll bring it. Excellent soup."}
{"text":"This is one place I always visit when I'm home spending time with the family. We actually remember the owner who was a waiter at our old favorite sushi joint, and when he mentioned to us that he was starting his own place (around the time when the quality was starting to slide) we promised him to check it out.   Five years later and this is the place for my mom, cousins and me! I strongly STRONGLY recommend the spicy avocado roll. It is thick and velvety, and there is no fish, so it is a good introduction to people who are \"new to sushi and scared to try\", and the flavors are spot-on.   Everything is good here, and I've even had some of their cooked items, like the lunch curry, and it was filling and enjoyable. The quality of food is consistent and the restaurant is clean and stylish."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!! Love the Chef cooking on sizzling grill right in front of you. The aroma is mmmmm...."}
{"text":"Excellent food and prices. Sit at the frill and watch them make your food. Great choices off sushi and bento boxes but lots to choose fromifyou do not eat sushi like me. This is a Japanese restaurant with sushi, not a sushi restaurant. The staff are amazing too. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I was referred to this sushi restaurant by several people. Someone said it was as good as sushi in Vancouver so of course we needed to try it. We went on valentines day so maybe the high volume decreased the quality. There other sushi restaurants in the area that are as good but less expensive like sushi motion and takemono. The sushi and sashimi were nothing special and fatty tuna, usually my favorite was bland. The spider was good. For all the hype I was pretty disappointed and it is nowhere close to Vancouver sushi!"}
{"text":"I have probably eat at The Villa more than any other restaurant in Whitby.    Possibly more than any other restaurant, period.  In my experience it's rare for a restaurant to put out food this consistent but I feel like I have been going there for ten years or so and I have never had a bad meal.  It's the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to and I have been to a few.  I'm vegetarian so my go-tos are any of the spicy rolls--avocado, broccoli and asparagus.  All amazingly good.  Always fresh.  I've yet to find another sushi restaurant that even comes close.  Also great are the croquette, agetofu and tofu steaks--all delicious.  The spring rolls are good and remind me of mini Indonesian lumpia.  And the edamame is...well.  Edamame.  It's good but there's only so much you can do with it.  The service here is always friendly and attentive.  It's always clean.  I never feel rushed to leave.   The only negative thing I can say is that it's not closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Delicious sashimi. Never disappointed with the variety and how fresh it is. Not AYCE but great for when you know exactly what you want."}
{"text":"I frequent the Villa and I can't rave about the food enough. I've experienced both the sushi and the teppanyaki (sp?) and I will keep going back. My favourite dish hands down is the spicy asparagus rolls. If you haven't tried them, do it. Amazing! The only beef I have is they take forever to give you the bill. I have always had to go up to the cash to ask for it even after waiting half an hour after asking for it."}
{"text":"It's a good spot. Healthy sized sushi rolls. Definitely filling. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always our go to for sushi night whether going out or staying in, it is always exceptional quality."}
{"text":"Great experience.  We sat at the Teppanyaki table and the food was excellent, big portions, even at lunchtime.  Very friendly service, family atmosphere, good pricing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere friendly service and delicious foods. We went there on Saturday for lunch. We're group of eight people (includes 4 kids). The dressing for the house salad was made by their chef, not store brought salad dressing. We had temperatura shrimps and veggies, their signatures rolls, sushi pizza, a mixed of sushi & sashimi, etc. Portions were great! We're all very satisfied! We're going back for teppanaki next time."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with my family.  The food was delicious and I wanted to try the hibachi table.  I ordered the steak bento box and it came with California roll, vegetable / shrimp tempura, and spring rolls.  A lot of variety and very filling!  I would come back to eat for sure.  Only downside is that they do not have any activities available for children.  My nephew was kind of bored waiting for the food to come.  Also, the service was pretty terrible.  The servers just didn't seem to understand the concept of serving, like making room at the table and not expecting the customer to make room.  And also, don't put hot soup in front of a toddler.  Other than that, great food and dining experience."}
{"text":"I was back in Ontario after moving away and the first thing I thought of as a place to take my hosts, who are new to Whitby, was The Villa.  We arrived around 6pm on a Friday as they were just getting busy.  We asked to sit at the actual teppanyaki grill table.  Rather amusingly, the hostess informed us there was a $25 minimum to sit there and seemed concerned we'd object - but teppanyaki dinner combos start at $23.99 so it wasn't exactly a big deal.  For those who haven't experienced it, teppanyaki is as much a performance art as a meal - it's food prepared on a teppan, essentially a large flat griddle, by chefs who interact with diners.  The Villa's chefs aren't quite the showmen you'll find at a (much pricier) Benihana, but they're still great to watch, very skilled, and friendly.  We were a little disappointed that we didn't get an \"onion volcano\" during our meal, but when Andy (who was our chef) started cooking for the party that arrived during our dinner, he did it and we were suitably impressed.  Overall, starting at $24 you get a great dining experience.  Teppanyaki combos include salad, miso, your meal, and ice cream at the end.  A good selection of drinks is available, including the huge cans of Sapporo I actually had trouble finishing because of the size of my meal.  We added a little sushi as well, and as previous experiences were, it was also good, very fresh ingredients.  For those not sitting around the teppan, they offer quite a large menu of sushi and other Japanese options, including a lot of bento box dinners.  Definitely a great spot for dinner in Whitby."}
{"text":"Great customer service, and definitely AMAZING food. Table cooking, hot foods and sashimi are all amazing. Even their rice and noodle options are delicious!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place! I used to come here WEEKLY.... so now I went back to find that something had changed.... the manager left, I think.  The new floor manager, Kyle, has a huge attitude... Disdain I think is a good description. He needs a hug.   Food is really fishy, low quality.   VERY disappointed. Never coming back. I'll be looking for another place."}
{"text":"After living in downtown Toronto and having the luxury of experiencing some great sushi houses, I didn't know what to expect from a place in Whitby.   I was pleasantly satisfied by The Villa and I will be back.    The portion sizes were beyond satisfying and the flavours were surprisingly good.  They could be compared to a good sushi house in Toronto.  One area I feel needed some additional attention was the tightness of the rolls.  I prefer to have my sushi be tightly packed and remain in tact while trying to eat it.    It was pretty damn good.  Try them, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the Villa when we first moved to the area. Accustomed to Toronto style sushi and tepp it didn't hit the mark for us."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Durham IMHO. Nice potions of fish and very fresh.  Only place in Durham I know of that serves Toro.  Will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very fresh and consistent. Try the spicy salmon hand roll. The kids love the teppanyaki table cooking."}
{"text":"It is a huge amount of food. Menu says don't share the tepanyaki because it's calculated for one person... I should have shared. Chef is amazing and so is the food. Hot table and sushi both. The \"villa sushi\" is the most delicious one I have probably ever tried. Only bad thing, the waitress was incredibly rude. Believe it or not, she actually shushed me when I was trying to clarify an order for her because we were a big party (I thought I was helping, I'm a server too). And ok, she was pregnant, but that is no excuse for rudeness."}
{"text":"Not enough options to cater to specific tastes. As a picky eater, I don't think this is the place for me."}
{"text":"Have been going every year for the past 5 years.  Wife likes to go for our anniversary.  She loves the shorts ribs.  They are good however I prefer the beef rolls  Also full after eating with leftovers."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best tapenyaki restaurants I've been too. The portions are HUGE, food is fresh and delicious, and always always always get the cooking tables. Not only does the food taste better (since it is literally prepared in front of you) but it's an experience in itself. Definitely will return, often."}
