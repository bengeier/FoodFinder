{"text":"I go to this place almost strictly for takeout.
It's a pretty standard sushi joint.

They have decent priced bento boxes ($8.75-$12.50) and some goo lunch specials.

It's not the best, but it's not the worst either."}
{"text":"It's too pricy for what it is. 

Sushi weren't good: 1. the rice is not cooked well, they don't stick together, just kept falling everywhere. 2. the salmon quality was not great, as you can tell, the pink was so pale with huge white gap. That's the cheapest quality you can get.

The service was just cold. It said on the take out menu that 10% off for take off on all items. Then when I ordered one spicy tuna roll, it's like $6 something with tax, they told me they won't give me 10% off under $10.  I was about to change, then they said they are already making it... so they said you just need to order more. 

I did order more as I didn't know it was not good. But seriously, for what it is, not worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"After practically living beside this sushi joint for several years and having never went in before, I decided tonight was the night...and it definitely won't be the last. 

Was it the best sushi I've ever had before? Of course not, but it was very good.

Our order for 3 is below:

Spicy Yellow Tail Roll w/ spicy mayo - I'm a sucker for hamachi, it has long been my fav choice of fish for sashimi, sushi or maki. It was not as good as I had hoped but it was still good, the mayo was also ok, could have had more punch, more tartness or citrus perhaps.  

Philadelphia (Deep Fried Spicy Tuna Roll w/ cream cheese) - This is my g/f's absolute fav and the very reason she started even eating sushi. It has great texture around the edge and the tuna is delicious, there is however too much cream cheese for me. If you like cream cheese tho this would be money for you, it is creamy silky smooth when it first arrives and in its prime when the roll is still warm. It has a slight spicy hint to it but nothing to even remotely worry about. 

Sushi Pizza (Salmon, spicy mayonnaise on deep fried rice) - Fantastic. I am used to flatter, less tasty sushi pizzas which remain forgettable, yet this one really stood out for a few reasons. For one it had a sizable amount of height, at its peek probably 2\". The rice pizza base was fluffy with the top lightly deep fried and crisp. On top laid sexy chunks of the mayo laced salmon with a generous amount of roe. We completely devoured it savouring every bite. 

Dynamite Roll (Shrimp, Tempura, Avocado w/ spicy mayo) - Solid roll all around. Well seasoned, well assembled and well presented. I appreciated the fact that there were shrimp tails on both ends of the roll and not just one which is often the case. 

Last was the 18pc Toronto Sushi Combo.  Salmon 5pc, Tuna 2pc, Grouper 2pc, Shrimp 1pc, Clam 1pm, Eel 1pc and Spicy Salmon Roll 6pc. 

There was nothing special that stood out on this platter for me except for the spicy salmon roll. The sushi overall was fresh but really nothing notable. I did however notice that several pieces of the sake severely lacked in marbling, yet still tasted half decent. The spicy salmon roll was great, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

In conclusion I would highly recco hitting this spot up for their Special Rolls. I can not fully vouch for hand rolls, lunch specials or \"hot deli boxes\" (lost in translation). In an age where there seems to be a sushi spot on every corner it is good to know what is better then average and what is not, overall, Ichimi is definitely better than average. 

Pros:
Lunch special runs from 11:30am - 4pm
10% off all take out. 
Quiet and attentive service
7 days a week 11:30am - 10:30pm"}
{"text":"For sushi, this place is decent -- the fish is quite fresh, however, not worth the price that you pay for.

Another down side is that it's a small restaurant and the deep fryer they use for tempura is located where they make the sushi as well at the sushi bar.  Therefore, when you walk out, you smell like tempura in the end

I'm stil trying to get this smell out of my clothes."}
