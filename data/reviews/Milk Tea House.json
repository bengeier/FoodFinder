{"text":"Tried this for the first time. They've added about a half dozen more tables, have some privacy screens up, decor is cute. Workers were earnest and ready to help. I had the mango green tea and it was tasty, not too sweet, hint of green tea flavor and the jelly was soft and fresh. Only three bucks for a medium too. Service only took a few minutes, no line, just steady customers, few people sitting down. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Milk tea house is great! If you've had a bad drink, I encourage you to go back and try something else - they have tons of things on their menu (especially since they just added a lot of new things) like boiled tofu, chicken wings, and great shaved snow ice in several flavors (taro, coconut, mango, chocolate, green tea, etc.) in addition to lots of great drinks.   ?C???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"To be honest, they have the best milk tea in champaign. I didn't come during the opening event so I can't judge other people's comment for that, but their milk tea is so good. The Thai and mocha flavor. Oh my god, just love it. Also I like the way you can customize you drink to reduce the sugar. My personal favorite is the coffee milktea. It has the coffee flavor blend with tea. Awesome!"}
{"text":"A great place to go for bubble tea! The decor is nice and homey, and the staff is very friendly! It's more or less the bubble tea shop I wish we've had on campus for the last 4 years. And they actually have non-milk fruit teas (which I highly recommend)!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every day! Milk tea house is hands down my favorite place for bubble tea. I used to only get their bubble tea, but since I have been coming here so often, I decided to try everything on their menu. Though some things are pricey, they are all so delicious and worth it! (Except maybe the roasted sweet potato because it was just a sweet potato lol)"}
{"text":"So randomly visited my alma mater and stumbled upon this place since I was craving a smoothie and apparently smoothie king is gone.  They just opened up recently or maybe even today.  Looks nice and clean and they have like way more workers than they probably need.   I ended up getting a taro bubble tea and the gf got matcha milk tea.  Not sure if it's a promo or something but the tea was free!  Whoo hoo.  Anyway,  the bubble tea was delicious for 4.50 for a large. Would definitely come back if I come down for a visit again to try a new flavor."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars it still wouldn't be enough to describe how good evening was from the service to the food. Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"I had to wait half an hour for my drink and there weren't even that many customers at the time. The drinks tasted watered down and the only taste I could gather was the jelly they added because they ran out of boba, which I didn't even request.   The product was not worth the long wait. Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Taste is awesome, the space is small but cute. They play Chinese music, which takes me back to my summer abroad. Just a little pricier than I would like, 3.50 for the smallest size which is labeled medium but is more like a small. Original Milk Tea is so tasty :)"}
{"text":"The first time I went with my girlfriend she had a disappointing experience with their macha bubble tea while I got the mango bubble tea which was so-so. I went again and order the almond bubble tea and it was complete trash. I only took two sips before throwing it out. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"The grand opening buy 1, get 1 free deal ended, and that might also be the end of my visits here. They just opened on 4/24, and I think they're off to a shakey start. I do enjoy the taro milk tea though! I also really like their cartoon animal cups and lid covers that sort of teach you Chinese fruit names. Depending on when you come, there may be a large crowd of people, which means your order will take some time to make as they make everything to order - nothing is premade. Also, they don't allow for customizations. You can only get what's offered on the menu - no fruit substitutions, etc. Unfortunately, there are only two tables to sit at, so you'll likely be standing around while waiting. I hope they'll get more chairs and tables because there's a lot more room in the shop.  My one pet peeve is that some of the fruit syrup they use to flavor their milk teas tastes weirdly artificial. I got a strawberry milk tea and it tasted like I was drinking a liquid, watered down strawberry ring pop. I tried a friend's mango green tea and it was ridiculously sweet with a tang of mango. Otherwise, it's not very remarkable milk tea that would make me come back.  I'd give them two and a half stars, but I bumped it to three because the service is really nice and the employees do try very hard to get the orders correct. Also, when I came on Friday as they were closing up and finishing the last orders, the owner lady gave me and my friends free drinks to try anyway, which was sweet of her. Everything on the menu is relatively inexpensive and under $5."}
{"text":"I just tried their new products..like eel don and boiled food (i forgot the name)... Do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"The Milk Tea House has so many amazing reviews and I really loved the decor, the service and the amazing foosball table that I almost won at; the best. This tea house is located inside a small restaurant cove on the second floor- highly unsuspecting. I ordered the green tea bubble tea with boba and my friend ordered the vanilla milk tea. I found my green tea to be refreshing but not the sort of consistency and flavor I'm used to. I love green tea and this one fell sort of short on the tea flavor. However, I will return as so many reviews quote the Milk Tea House as having other amazing drinks. Perhaps they have hidden fortes in other teas. I did enjoy the boba consistency and flavor, it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"We've been waiting half an hour for our drinks and still haven't gotten them.  I came earlier in the day and their milk teas are very weak, tastes like water and powdered flavoring with no semblance of a tea flavor.   It's all hype but  they are ridiculously slow and the product isn't even good. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Came here on grand opening day and although it did take a while to receive my order, I came back the following weekend and the service was indeed much better! One of my personal favorites is their mango green tea. It isn't made too sweet, but isn't too bland, either.  The staff there are friendly, price is reasonable and with the new addition of the daily 25% off specials as well as having met my current boyfriend here, I have no choice but to give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The wait is long but I can understand it. They don't pre make things. However, the powder they use for the drinks is too sweet and overwhelming. And my coffee jelly was hard :( not a fan."}
{"text":"Most authentic bubble tea place in the entire Champaign-Urbana area! For those looking for real bubble tea that's not over sugary with a plethora of flavors, look no further! The gift cards are also a great investment too - $50 gift cards have a $10 bonus, and $30 have a $5 bonus! Will definitely be back in the future."}
