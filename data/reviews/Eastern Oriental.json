{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved to the area 10+ years ago. Food is amazing (I normally order the spicy shanghai noodles along with the jai doo chicken wings) The noodles are just the right spiciness for me but can be looked at as being a bit on the hotter side for the average person. However, they do ask you what level of spiciness you want it at. The chicken wings are just your run of the mill fried wings and a bit on the smaller side but I think the price is worth it. Pricing is on the lower end for a decent amount of food which is always nice! I've never dined in but other than the furniture being a bit tacky and the plaza in which the restaurant is located being a bit old, nothing seems off about it. I'm VERY surprised at the fact that this place isn't more of a hot spot. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering take out from this place for quite some time now.  Great food, great value for money.  Staff is very friendly and always smiling when I pickup my food."}
{"text":"For the food court price and the convienice I 'd like go rate a 5 star. It's one of those places that makes fake Chinese food right and sweet for a late dinner as opens till 11pm. Ordered combo 1- sweet and sour spare ribs and combo 5 Sichuan chicken. As you can see from my pic, the portion is very generous for the price. My Sichuan chicken came with lots of stir fry veggie,steam rice, chicken is tender. Similar food at man chu wok will cost you $11.95 instead of $7.95. I also like the free egg roll that come with combo, it's like a fried spring roll that's bigger with bean sprouts and meat fillings. Chicken fried rice was good too, lots of flavour. Thumbs up for this hidden gem in my neibouroughhood!"}
{"text":"My usual place was closed for vacation, so I decided to try this place. What a cute little retro spot! It's very small inside and I doubt they get many sit-down customers, but I love places that are like little flashbacks to earlier times. Ha. So I didn't get anything fancy or amazing, but I was extremely happy with my order, it was fresh and delicious and ready very quickly. 
Service was great, and prices were fair. I'll definitely come back again to try some different dishes, and not just when my usual place is closed! :)"}
