{"text":"I had high hopes for good southern fried chicken. I was disappointed. We were welcomed when we walked in. We were asked if we were taking out or dining in. We chose to dine in. We were told to sit anywhere. None of the tables and chairs match. Then the man that welcomed us told us the menus were in the napkin holder on the table. Without come to the table the man and woman working yell across the restaurant that the food was cooked to order and to tell them what we wanted. The table we sat at was very dimly lit. We had to yell our order across the restaurant. A few minutes later another couple entered the restaurant. They were greeted at the door, the man introduced himself as the owner, they were shown to a table and given menus. The lights were turned on. The owner came to the table a took their order.   We decide to change our order to go. The couple that came in after us were black, we are not. Very sad that any one is treated as we were."}
{"text":"Tasty food. May have to wait. Too few tables. 1/3 of floor space is taken by the band that plays jazz. Loud. Come with people you don't want to talk to: ) Good for take out."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for good restaurant that specializes in chicken & waffles. My boyfriend found this spot on his way to my  house and decided that we should stop by  for dinner. I thanked him after the frist bit! I am a Cali girl and we have some of the most amazing restaurant in LA but this... puts  Phonix on the map for me as the best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have been wanting to stop by here for some time. A friend of mine lives in the area and raved about it, so my expectations were pretty high. My family and I had just ended with a long day of vollyeball tournaments and I had no desire to go home and cook. We were in Mesa, but based on my friends reviews, thought it would be worth the drive. I was sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible. They messed up our order and we had to pay for them to correct the order. No apologies, nothing. I thought they had forgot about us, but 30 minutes into it I was reminded that they just remembered our order. Kind of wish we would've gone home instead. Needless to say, we will never go back"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, my chicken and waffles dish was prepared from scratch for me.  I have not had a chicken dish cooked fresh, not prepared ahead of time in a long time.  It takes a little longer, but is worth the wait.  The chicken was fabulous and the waffle was great.  They also have a chicken dish with no waffle and included 2 sides.  Allow a little extra time it is worth the wait.  I will be back there again soon, Delicious!"}
{"text":"First time meeting Rags and eating his delicious chicken and waffles!! But it will not be the last!! Home cooking at its best with some great conversation!! Call a head to order the fried pork chop sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken in a homey, very clean atmosphere. Rags is very nice and friendly. Very pleasant live background music. BYOB. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had. Next time we are in Youngtown we will stop in. Interior colorful & clean. Folks are down home and friendly. Love it!! Thanks Rags"}
{"text":"This place may have the best fried chicken I've ever had. Somehow every single bite was crunchy, the batter was delicious, and the chicken was tender. The macaroni and cheese was also fantastic, super cheesy. The waffles were also good, but they didn't stand out nearly as much as the chicken or mac and cheese. The surrounding area isn't super nice, but the restaurant itself is very welcoming. It's a large open space, the owner/cook/server/everything prepares all the food right in front of you. He's also a really nice guy. I'd highly recommend it going."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this little place. I love supporting small business but this one fell short. Here's a rundown. *There is very little parking here. It's next to a convenience store and although not all the spaces are marked, 3 of them are reserved for the store. The owners of the restaurant had to keep going outside to inform guests of this tidbit. *The inside needs some polishing. A little investment in paint, matching tables and chairs and wall art would go a long way to make the place more inviting. There were children's placemats on the tables. You can get a set of 4 placemats at Ross for under $10. Another small investment to make the place more inviting. Bring the child mats out only when children are in the party.  *We had to eat at a table with a stranger. They have tables for up to 6 and tell you to sit wherever. It is awkward to break bread with people you don't know. I would suggest buying smaller tables which can be joined together as needed for bigger parties but small enough where you can eat with only your party.  *They do not have a soft drink dispenser. There is a table with bottles of 2 liter soft drinks to self serve. This poses a problem both around cleanliness and keeping drinks carbonated. I'm not a fan of random people putting their hands on a soda bottle. A patron isn't held to health department standards for cleanliness so I find this very unsanitary. Also, a couple of hours without the top securely fastened makes for flat sodas. For a place this small, it shouldn't be self serve in any case.  *The syrup on the table was covered with a sandwich bag, I assume, for freshness. There are containers specifically for syrup used in most restaurants. I would recommend investing in those instead.  *The cook and the cashier, who I assume were the owners, were friendly but lacked professionalism. They tried to please but they will need to learn to speak with people more tactfully.  *They had a live band. Nice touch but the place is very tiny so the band was too loud given the space. There was a lot of yelling and leaning in to communicate with people in your party.  *We had the chicken and waffle plate. The waffle was a bit too dense and lacked the fluffiness and sweetness waffles should have. Condiments, except for the syrup, were no where to be found. We found out halfway through our meal, hot sauce was an option. Grant you, we could have asked but it's a soul food joint. Hot sauce should be a given.  *I will say the chicken was good. It was juicy, well cooked and seasoned. The grease was clean so it didn't have the rancid taste fried food does when the grease is old. I do greatly appreciate this.   I hope this place takes up some of the suggestions and comments to heart. I would like to see this small business succeed."}
{"text":"This place isfar better than most places in Sun City. Great Jazz. And the macaroni and cheese is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is really great! Rags and Inez are the best. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes and listen to some good music."}
{"text":"Delicious southern food! We had the sweet tea and chicken and waffles which were amazing! Definitely going back!  Southern hospitality on point!"}
{"text":"This is the best soul food spot in AZ hands down!! No wonder they are ranked #1 in the state! The chicken was world class better than ya mamas, ya great aunt, ya granny, ya cousin, ya wife's and ya great grand pappy! If you drive by this place without stopping you are a fool!"}
{"text":"Living in the far west valley, there aren't too many southern cooking places to choose from. In fact I only know of two. Rags Real Chicken and Waffles one of them.   Rags is located in Youngtown on the west side of 111th ave and Nevada Ave. It is inside a little strip of businesses and if you blink you might just miss it.   Rags is the definition of a little mom and pop restraunt. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The restraunt is much like a house converded like so many other restraunts found in the southern U.S. They have old used kitchen tables and chairs. No soda dispensing machines or formal cutlery. But what they lack in decor they make up in flavor.   We had the chicken and waffels, shrimp basket and kids chicken tender basket. All three dishes were fried with corn meal and fresh. The chicken was very crisp and juicy perfectly done along with a buttery vanilla tasting waffle. The shrimp were very big and and also done just right. (I hate over cooked shrimp.) The kids chicken tenders were also fresh and full of flavor.   I'm looking forward to going back for some live music and to try some of the other menu items that were recommended by friends that went. I highly recommend going to Rags!"}
{"text":"Hubby was hungry for chicken and waffles. Went to Yelp and found Rags. We are very happy with our choice. Chicken was perfect, juicy yet not greasy one bit. Owners are extremely friendly. We felt at home and very comfortable. Makes you feel like you are eating with family. Will definitely return, looking forward to music nights."}
{"text":"Where to start... Chicken & Waffles, cole slaw, mac & cheese and chess pie? Yeah. The cornbread crisp on the chicken amazing. Can't wait to try it with the catfish. Waffles made with cinnamon and vanilla. Delish. The cole slaw may be the best ever. It had a touch of onion, tomato, carrot and more. Simply wonderful. Rags even suggested I call for specialties such as fried chicken gizzard and livers. Which, I will do. My mac & cheese expert, my wife, said this was the best she had ever had in a restaurant. BBQ on Thursday-Saturday. Specials this night were pulled pork and homemade chicken noodle soup. I bit eclectic but excellent food and very family friendly. Small and comfortable. Would have given 5 stars but thought prices were just a tad too high. Oh, don't forget the live music! Try Rags before the secret gets out."}
{"text":"Great mom n pop restaurant that serves the best Chicken & Waffles I've ever had -- super glad we stopped in and will definitely be back.  Also, make sure to order the fries - they are just a natural cut potato and are freaking delicious."}
{"text":"I stop by here the other day with the wife and I had chicken & waffles while she had chicken & fries. The chicken was tasty and had its own style. It was great with my waffles. My wife's fries was nice and crispy. The owner was cool to talk too & sat with us during lunch. Very hospitable. Definitely a place to come back. A lil pricey to me but worth it."}
{"text":"My dad was in town visiting from Hawaii and wanted \"chicken and waffles\" because we've all never had it before (my BF seen the sign a few days before and got excited because we don't have food joints like that in this area haha) My hula dance studio is right down the road and we live around the corner in Youngtown so we figured to give it a try!   Anyway, we all tried the chicken and waffles (#1) on the menu and it was pretty good! We also had Mac and cheese and cole slaw. My BF and dad finished their plates fast hahaha the musicians came over and chatted with us and played the harmonica for my baby! It was the cutest thing!!!!   The only thing we didn't like was that our eyes were burning up from the smoke while he was cooking :( I also think they should fix their seating (BUT there was a LIVE BAND on a Friday evening so maybe that's why the tables were pushed to the corner) band was GREAT!!!   Parking: the side parking NEEDS lighting! We had our 1 year old daughter with us and it was pitch black so we had to use our phone light to check our surroundings..... there's parking in the front if you get there early enough OR you can just go during the day and it'll be fine :) just be careful during the night when you park on the side.   Overall: we would DEFINITELY go back :) they are in a great spot! Our little town needed something like this!   I was thinking of doing a short video and sending to \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives!\""}
{"text":"Best waffle I've had in a while. Also had fried shrimp,macaroni n cheese cole slaw everything was delish!!! I removed one star because there was only one thing wrong the chicken was not like it was in the pictures that somebody posted chicken fried chicken anyway usually has a coating on it flour or something this had nothing it's not that it didn't taste good I'm just not used to eating chicken  with no kind of batter on it especially fried chicken so the owner might want to take note of that"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover!  Probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had! So good I had to order more to go. The waffles are much better than the LoLo's used to. It's not fancy, or fast. The menu is very simple. But everything is cut & cooked to order. There was a stage for a band but they weren't playing when I was there. This is a great family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Charming, rustic to be kind. Owner, cook, busboy, server was a nice hardworking guy who was intensely likeable. Food was above average"}
{"text":"Wait Soul food & Music...  So you're telling me that I can get a plate of chicken & waffles and I ain't gotta sit next to plaid Hipsters that wreaks of scented oils & too much beard wax?  Wait.   Soo, you're telling me I can hear Live music Thursday, Friday, & Saturday and I ain't gotta listen to the gossip of Club-Slut-Bimbos talking in text (OMG!) Twitter or Facebook?  Hold up.    So you're telling me that I can bring my own beer, sit in a room of my peers, Jaw jackin, having a drink, dancing without dealing with Snottsdale douche baggery?   You have made a friend for life, Rags. Blessed are the patrons of food and Music.   And you gotta meet this dude, Rags. Legit from head to toe. Reminds me of being in the South where this kinda hospitality is legendary."}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time tonight, brought my mommand stepdad this time. The staff and owners are very friendly, it's like coming into their home and making sure you have everything you need. The live Music tonight was great, I like having some nice music to accompany my meal. The chicken and waffles was great the chicken was juicy and drench it in hot sauce it makes it soooo good. Their Mac and cheese is great you can tell it's homemade. Sometimes you have to share a table with other guests but that's what makes this place one of a kind. I recommend everyone try this little gem in Youngstown you won't regret it.  P.S. it's BYOB so you can bring your own booze into the restaurant which makes it even better there's a liquor store next door if you forget lol."}
{"text":"Love love love Rags food! Love the feel. Makes me feel like I'm at a family members house having some good food!"}
{"text":"Awesome does not say enough. The chicken was some of the best on Earth. Better than my mom's and she agreed with me as she ate her own delicious meal. I was so happy to see my mom raving about the waffle and the chicken. Getting her to eat AND enjoy it is nigh on impossible.  But Rag's did it. I can't wait to take my mom back. My bff munched till he was overstuffed. I ate like a queen. We were treated like beloved friends/family and had an absolutely marvelous evening with Mr. Rags, his wife who blessed us with her cooking, and his great kids. I almost wanted to ask if there was a TV room to go to after supper so I could snooze of the afterglow of being well fed on gourmet home cooking. I cannot decide what is more tempting though... the mac n cheese, bbq beans, or slaw. I would be so fat if I was truly kin of Rags and he would never be rid of me. When you go, make sure you bring your appetite and don't be surprised to feel like you are at home. Truly, a superb experience that you don't get just anywhere. So make sure to visit and delight your tastebuds. These folks are real, wonderful, talented, honest, magicians of soul."}
{"text":"OMG so good! Awesome little gem in Youngtown! Chicken was delish, waffle is so good you could eat it w/o syrup at all, mac & cheese was great! Live music was wonderful too! I for sure will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here at 7:57pm on a Friday evening, within posted hours on yelp. The business was completely closed down. I suggest calling ahead and not trusting posted hours. We won't be back after a 35min drive that left us annoyed and without dinner.  Update as per comment below, if a business cannot keep hours, nor do without snide replys, it does not deserve to stay open as those are about the most basic rules of owning a local business, which I do as well. Confirmation of why I will not return."}
{"text":"The jazz is good.The mac and cheese is the best thing on the menue. Dont go there if you want barbeque,  Dillons and famous Daves will make you smile. Not this place."}
{"text":"We searched for the best friend chicken around us and found Rags!!  Have been back many time!!  Always very welcoming!!  The chicken and waffles are amazing !! Definitely recommend on ur first visit!!  Awesome family ran small business! They usually have live music in the evening and it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly atmosphere!  Ordered the chicken and waffles was happy to see that it was made fresh to order. The chicken was crispy and hot, the seasoning had me wanting to order another plate. The waffles complimented the saltiness of the chicken giving the overall plate that sweet and savory combination that you are looking for!   The live music was a nice addition to the ambiance. Will return soon!  Warning: getting chicken and waffles \"to go\" will make your house smell ridiculously awesome!!"}
{"text":"The owners of Rags are genuinely nice people. Not only did we have an enjoyable conversation, that chicken was great.  The chicken was cooked to order and crispy. The chess pie was out of this world.   Our bill for two chicken and waffles dinners, two drinks and a piece of pie was $37 with tip."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Delicious food, personal customer service, lively music, easy to find with convenient parking, hospitable environment.  I ordered the chicken with Mac & cheese and okra (they don't always have okra).  If youre looking for a comparison, this food is so much better than LoLo's!  Plus, it's way closer. I intend to come back to try each item on the menu.  And, it's great for some live music.  You must try Rag's!"}
{"text":"Our bicycle group composed mostly of Canadian snowbirds arrived at Rags this morning for Chicken and Waffles.  Rags and his wife were there to cook and serve us and one of our group shared the history of Chicken and Waffles which she obtained from the internet.  Rags listened then gave us his version from his upbringing in Alabama which was truly memorable. Everyone enjoyed the food, the ambiance and the chance to learn about the origin of this unusual food pairing."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this restaurant for about 8 months now and was hesitant to try it. But today I finally did, and man I wish I went sooner! It was definitely a treat. I ordered the chicken and waffles. My husband and I sat at the bar, which is in front of the kitchen. My mouth literally watered because of how amazing the waffles smelt.. the chicken was nicely seasoned and was moist. Everything about it was great. It's definitely a place YOU HAVE TO TRY! It's different then other mom and pops. It has a nice atmosphere and great live music. Th me family who runs it is super friendly. The actual set up was definitely a little weird when you walk in but it's just different. That's what made me love it, honestly.. I will be coming back weekly!!"}
{"text":"I work at Roger Cox AC & Heating a few doors down from Rags. So for lunch we figured we would give Rags a try. I had the 2 piece chicken and waffle and my co worker had the Rags special with 2 piece chicken and a side of fries. Food was amazing, chicken was nice and crispy and so were the fries. The waffle was also great home made batter one of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Total ripoff. 17.00 for almost no food. Got 2 tiny sides of okra while owner was eating a huge plate of it in front of me. No coleslaw ready at noon?? Shrimp crappy. Wish it had been all the hype"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and check out the real chicken & waffles... 100% did not disappoint. Rags greeted us at the door and it felt like we walked into our family's house. The chicken is amazing and freshly cut, fried to order. The waffle was great with the cinnamon and syrup. Throw some hot sauce & syrup on the chicken and it can't get any better. Real food not processed! Drop in and check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food,  great service and great prices! All the best qualities to have in a food business.  We will definitely be back.  I Highly recommend Rags!"}
{"text":"So we left another place to come here. The kid had a hankering for  and waffles. Who says no to that? Googled  & waffles near me. We found Rags! Thank you Google. So close to my house. Yesssssss. Don't park in front of the market those guys will tow you! Everyone got the same. Waffle & dark meat.  Ordered Kool Aid. It comes in colors not flavors you know wassup. You don't want a soda. The waffle smells so good while you wait. Remember this isn't fast food it's made to order food. Takes time to make it with love. Reminded me of my Grandma's . Got the kid got his first. It was torture, he described every bite. The Chicken has that skin you want. It's crisp and cracks just right. The waffle isn't to sweet. It's just right.  Just a lil syrup to be sweeter. The second bite  his eyes rolled back. I knew I couldn't wait. I like mine hot sauce & syrup. When I got mine it was everything his eyes said. Juicy and not greasy. So moist. The seasoning is just right.  I am a fan.  Happy to have it so close. They are a music venue so call for the entertainment. They give us the list but the  made me forget. I think they are known for music too, so stay for both. The  will keep you coming back. We will come back for the music. You should call ahead if you want anything special ordered. They will, with notice and when able to. Just glad we found you and hope to see you soon. Thanks Rags."}
{"text":"Came for some food at 1pm on a Friday. Completely closed. Glad I drove an extra 20 min out of the way.  I'm sure the owner doesn't care, but if thats how he's going to run his business I'm sure it will be closed soon."}
{"text":"This place is the best chicken and waffles.  It's a drive out to Youngtown but so worth it.  Puts others to shame.  Great family run business with personality you won't forget."}
{"text":"Wicked delicious fried chicken! Crispy, salty, not at all greasy with just the perfect hint of peppery spice! I went for the chicken and waffle and added sides of crunchy fresh cold slaw with shredded cabbage and red peppers in a creamy dressing, and perfect Mac and cheese with more cheese than noodles. Perfect.   The owners, Rags and Inez, were super warm and welcoming and checked on us several times. Though other reviewers have mentioned racial bias, I can tell you our white faces were treated like welcome members of the family. Even the kids who took orders and ran food out were polite and friendly.   Bias or rude attitude? Sorry, I don't buy it. For the person who called it unfriendly to kids, exactly who do you think the high chair was for? Next time walk in friendly with an open mind and perhaps you'll see the Rags I experienced.   Truth is, I can't wait to go back and try his off menu specials, especially the fried cabbage, collard greens, okra and sweet chess pie, even if the latter requires a double shot of insulin.   Beverages are available in cans (we did both Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke or you can go retro with kool aid. It's BYOB if you need something stronger.   The atmosphere is super casual with mismatched tables, comfy chairs, barstools and a hi-top table. Who cares? It's all about the food, the live music, and the hospitality of a hard working family. What are you waiting for? Y'all go!"}
{"text":"Not at all what I expected. I checked the reviews before coming and they were great, and said it was kid friendly. Kid friendly but you don't have high chairs or booster seats? So NOT kid friendly. I went to check out the all you can eat buffet. Not at all what I expected! Just warming trays with some chicken and a couple of sides..... we got our food to go since it wasn't kid friendly. I watched as the owners kid (maybe 10) took my fish with no gloves on and not sure if he washed his hands first to put it in the fryer. It looked very dirty and cluttered inside.  Was not impressed one bit with the flavor of the food. It was super salty but also had a slight sweet flavor. I've never been back, and will never go back. I really can't think about one good thing to say..... sorry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken and fish..Real southern taste.........................................................."}
{"text":"The BEST fried chicken I've ever had.  Very friendly staff, relaxing atmosphere, and amazing food!  Real sweet tea!  Will be back to check out the live music."}
{"text":"Really good food that's not heavy. The batter for the chicken was light and seasoned well. The waffle was not overly sweet. Really nice place over all. You get nice portions for the cost of the food"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Rags is there waiting to cook your food, all cooked to order.  Nothing fancy, you have to go to the corner store to get your alcohol.  BYOB I had chicken and waffles and inhaled it.  Not sure what was in the waffle but it had an unusual texture that worked well with the chicken. The chicken- perfectly seasoned and crispy.  Live music was playing, soft jazz and cover tunes to match the vibe Rags wants.  This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The owner is real rude the old guy  First time me and my friend came in we walked in said hello he didn't say nothing we starred at the menu for 5min before he finally said oh so you guys walk in and don't say hello ??? Like didn't you hear us say hi when we walk in and you have us a blank stare , anyways we try to order 4 combo meals then he goes to make our food said all his chicken is frozen and won't be able to make us anything for a few hours !!!!!  Then I try again today and they don't have no sides he answers the phone not no hi hello nothing just a voice on the phone saying what do you want tired to order again didn't have nothing but just chicken no sides or nothing   Don't know if this is a real restaurant or just a hang out place where he cooks when he feels like it :/"}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole in the wall that puts there heart into there food and business.    There approach is some what unconventional, not in a bad way,  (to all the fools out there that think chain restaurants are good, you will never get the personal attention from the owners like you will here).     The chicken was hot and perfectly cooked, the waffle very fluffy,  the cheese and mac and the coleslaw had a great flavor (I am very picky with what coleslaw I will eat)   My only complaint would be is I left hungry. The sides were very small. We plan on going back again and will let them know and see how they respond.  This place is way better then LoLo's   If you go on a nite they have music it is super loud.  It will be like going to a concert with table service.     Support small business  give them a try with an open mind and you will have a great experience."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Wednesday about 12:30 into what looks like my grandmothers dining room at Thanksgiving time, lots of dining room tables and chairs set up to feed the incoming masses. It felt like you were eating in someone's dining room. Tv was on and playing some local early day shows which kept us entertained as we waited for our food to arrive.   The owner was very pleasant and welcoming, let us know that all food was cooked to order and it'd be some time before it was ready. All good by me because Fresh=Best.   Ordered the #1 Ckn (2pieces) and Waffle combo, added an extra waffle for my son and figured we'd split the chicken. Also ordered 2 of the 4oz sides of Mac & Cheese and 2 glasses of Kool-Aid, seriously, because you have too! (I can't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid).   Chicken had awesome flavor, was crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside. Waffles had great flavor, I could smell the seasonings used in the waffle batter! I thought the Mac and Cheese was good, nothing out of this world, but I'm really picky about what I label great Mac and Cheese. My son though RAVED about it and proceeded to eat all of his and all of mine after I had my 1st two tastes.   I work nearby and have been putting off checking this place out, and now I'm kicking myself. I will definitely be back, and referring others here as well. It was $$ well spent."}
{"text":"If you love beans this is the place. And everything is fried to perfection! The sodas are self severed and flat if the person before you didn't close the bottle tightly. The cook wears a tee shirt that looks like he's wiped his hands on it; yikes! And he yells all the time! Overall I would not recommend eating there.  After reading other reviewers I have decided to change my star to a one. Believe the one or two stars reviews because it's ALL true!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time there, and I will definitely be back! Food was amazing and everyone was having a good time. They had some live music and peoole were singing and just making the place a fun place to be. The owners were the nicest people ever and kept coming out and talking to everyone. Like I said before we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all live music while you eat, nice touch.  The fried chicken and the fried catfish were fantastic.  We had sides of bbq beans and collard greens along with Mac n cheese and slaw which were all terrific.  We ended with a coconut pie a great ending to a lovingly prepared meal."}
{"text":"Did not lie this place. Opens at 11:00am reached there at 1:00pm. Nothing was ready to order. Wanted ribs but they were for the crowd that came to hear the music at night. . Will not be back."}
{"text":"Rag's is one of a kind! My entire crew loves this place for the food, music, & hospitality! And now they have a buffet too, almost fainted, nuff said! It's worth the drive again and again!"}
{"text":"The food does not reflect Southern cooking. The owner is very very rude to the customers.  The owner needs customer service and culinary training.  The food is terrible. Do not waste your time go to Lolo chicken and waffles on central. If that rude owner continue with that nasty attitude he will be out of business."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Definitely felt at home. My husband and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Authentic. Awesome. Amazing. Place was absolutely incredible. Waffles were on point, chicken was perfect.  Go. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I have come in a few times now. Always a pleasure.  Makes his own BBQ sauce.  Gave up a successful catering business to bring you (the public) delicious lunch and dinner specials in a bright but quaint atmosphere .  Live music Thurs, Fri, Sat.! I posted the menu.  Pulled pork coming soon! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"..... just ate....BOMB!...the owner Rag made everything In front of us. Chicken and the waffel. Mac and cheese..... Everything fresh. .... Fk lo lo's......"}
