{"text":"For an organic, vegan, sugar-free and gluten-free place (the first time I went, I was like, \"so what ingredients DO they use?), this cute cafe is really good! The food has an Indian fusion, and their gluten-free bread is very fresh and not dense like others. I've had two of their burgers, which were quite good but is more of a knife-and-fork type of classy burger. The last one I had was a potato patty with a pungent mango cilantro sauce that wasn't to my greatest liking. Their donut is amazing, although it's more like a muffin shaped into a donut, but still soft and yummy. Their waffle was very solid, with amazing cashew cream, but a little extra maple syrup we requested cost us a surprising amount!
Inexpensive on the whole for what it is, and cute, relaxing interior."}
{"text":"Really great food especially gluten free items without the worry of cross- contamination."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal with my 10 year old who has celiac disease. She has to eat gluten-free.  Everything is GF!!  The owner is wonderful. Food is delicious. My daughter fell in love with the bagels.  We even bought some to eat on the way home to New Jersey."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing here. The wait for the food, however, was a bit disappointing. The staff was super friendly, they just need to hire a few more people."}
{"text":"Great place for those with gluten sensitivity and/or vegan diet restrictions. I had the classic grilled cheese and didn't even realize it was not \"real\" cheese, so they win points for convincing me that vegan can be good. A little pricey but definitely worth it for a lunch date or a bi-monthly splurge on some always-good home cooking."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great doughnuts and a wonderful espresso and late.  I hope to make this cafe a regular haunt. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Delicious sweets! Cupcakes are a definite standout. Moist, rich, sweet, more heartbreakingly intense than your ex-boyfriend. Donuts that embrace your mouth lovingly. And, you can feel relatively guilt-free and light all day long, even after indulging!

The people who work here are incredibly sweet too. Are they sugar-free as well? Wow!"}
{"text":"NOTE (updated review, Sept 2015): This place has been closed for months. Very sad, I wish they would open a new location!

(previous review)
This place is really good! The veggie burger is amazing - packed with toppings and a variety of different spreads. The grilled veggie sandwich and portobello sandwich are both tasty too. The gluten-free buns are delicious - not dry or falling apart like many gluten-free breads. Possibly the best thing served are the cupcakes though. They're the only gluten-free cupcakes I've ever had that perfectly mimic the typical cupcake texture - fluffy and not dry at all! The icing is also light and abundant. 

I highly recommend this place. It's right upstairs from The Green Panther but the food is of a much higher quality and tastes less like fast food. It's also quiet and has plenty of sitting room, so it's a nice place to sit with a coffee and read or study. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because the prices are a little steep. It's still cheaper than the surrounding restaurants, but the burgers and sandwiches come out to over $8 with tax and are pretty small. If they came with a side or were priced a little lower I would come here all the time. Still, this place is one of the best, and most underrated, vegan restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free food! I was able to eat worry free. I had the grill cheese sandwich...  Best girll cheese ever! Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"They closed this location, no word on reopening yet. 
I was so sad when I found out they had closed. 
So glad this place is next to school and work. 
It's awesome to find a place that cares about food as much as they do at Cafe Verdure. It is what drives them to create great food that is Vegan, sugar free, gluten free and organic. 
I have yet to try an item on the menu that I did not enjoy. 
One of my favourites is definitely the pizza with the tomato sauce. Amazing."}
{"text":"Cafe Verdure is a vegan, sugar free, gluten free and organic cafe. It is located above Crudessence (a raw vegan restaurant) and La Panthère Verte (vegan fast food). I called this area the \"Wholy (holy whole food for long) Trinity\" for vegans. They offer a full array of dessert, snacks and entrees.The location offers an additional10% off for students. 

We were not a fan of the faux egg salad (tofu) on gluten free bagel ($4). While the bagel was comparable to traditional bagels, the egg salad was not. The special of the day was mushroom risotto. The mushroom risotto was over-salted. The chef had offer to prepare a second dish for us, unfortunately no avail. The second dish was only slightly less salted than its predecessor. I would not frequent Cafe Verdure due to the level of sodium in the mains but would consider trying their desserts."}
{"text":"I can't emphasize how much I appreciate that there's a place like Café Verdure on campus. Montreal typically doesn't have much in terms of vegan/gluten-free, and Café Verdure makes up for it.

I've had pretty much the full gamut of dessert/snacks, and I've yet to be disappointed. Not to mention that everything is organic and inexpensive.
I highly recommend that you try this place before it gets too well-known."}
