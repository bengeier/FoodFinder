{"text":"I don't give out many 2 star reviews, but my experience here was awful. Two co-workers and I came here for lunch. We were staying at the Hilton Doubletree down the street and were on a strict one hour lunch slot, which is why we came here.   One other co-worker and myself ordered off the lunch menu, which has a guarantee that your food will be out in 15 minutes. The third co-worker ordered off the regular menu, but it was a burger-- how long would making a burger possibly take?  We were there for a total of an hour and fifteen minutes. So much for keeping to our schedule. The food didn't come out in 15 minutes, but since one member of our party didn't order off the lunch menu, I guess that made the time guarantee null and void? We were in a rush, so we didn't try to argue for a free meal. After scarfing down our food, we tried multiple times to get our waitress's attention for the bill, but the lunch crew was celebrating a baby shower for a waitress in the back. It was kind of precious, because we could see her opening adorable baby-sized presents, along with a cake and balloons, but also extremely maddening, since they were obviously doing it at the expense of our precious time.   The strangest part of all was what happened last: we ran our own transactions. Keep in mind, we were all in Toronto from the United States on business. And, chances are, if you're reading this as a guest at the Doubletree, Radisson, or Sheraton down the street, then you might be, too. There's a chance that if you pay with a credit or debit card, the waitress will hand you a portable credit card machine and then leave you to punch in your bill amount, swipe, etc. yourself. Call me old fashioned, but what am I tipping you for, again? It took us another few minutes to figure out the card machine since our waitress disappeared to partake in baby shower celebrations.  All in all, NEVER again! If you're staying at an airport hotel in the area, go to Sushi-Ya across the street! Even a burger and poutine at Harvey's down the street would be a better option than Kelsey's."}
{"text":"Don't bother with this location. The service is lousy, the food is bland and over cooked. Save your money and eat at home!"}
{"text":"Kelsey's is one of the chains around Toronto I like.  It has the best baby back ribs I've had since leaving Los Angeles (where Cheesecake Factory's baby back ribs are pretty much unbeatable).  I usually get either the ribs/wing combo or the Konglomeration (which adds spicy popcorn shrimp to ribs and wings).  The shrimp are good but leaves a bit to be desired, with the spice stinging a bit too much in the mouth, but the honey-garlic sauce on the ribs and wings is very tasty.  The wings have just the right amount of batter to make them crispy yet remain juicy on the inside, and the baby back ribs are tender, as they should be -- too many rib places get this wrong by overcooking the ribs, sometimes even to the point of being burnt.  No such problem here.  I duck one star because the prices are really too high for food of this kind.  I ordered the Konglomeration plus an iced tea (to their credit, you get unlimited refills), but $30 for bar-type food is a bit too stiff.  I've had lunch once before at the Dixon Road Kelsey's, and while my lunch order, a fettucine alfredo, got there in 15 minutes, it was also something like $14.  The prices are the reason I don't go to this place more often.  For $30, I can almost go to The Keg two blocks away and get a prime rib steak."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and 2 daughters while we waited for our flight.  The food was expensive, but it's at the airport so what do you expect.   The host was really nice and brought us to a table right away - we were the only ones in the restaurant. He even gave my daughters some crayons and a kids menu (which was on a printed piece if white paper folded in half). My youngest daughter (she's 5) opened up the paper to discover that someone else had coloured in the pictures and answered the questions. I told her we would ask the server for a new one for her to colour.  When the waitress came over she seemed put by having to serve us, and she was visibly upset that my daughter wanted a paper menu sheet that was not already coloured on.   She got our drink orders wrong and didn't check to see how the food was. How was the food? Okay, I guess. We finished without the waitress coming back at all during the 45 minutes that we eat (we had finished our drinks and at no point did she or any of the staff offer us refills - even on water; I mean, that's just common sense)  When we had sat for 10 minutes with our plates in front another staff came by and cleared my wife's and mine but not our kids. 5 minutes later I managed to get our waitresses attention and she asked us if we wanted the bill, \"No\", I said, \"my daughters would like to have their dessert please.\" At this request she seemed completely frustrated and upset. She curtly asked them what they wanted and when it was brought out it was by the host that had seated us.  Here's the thing: you are at the airport and it's a pretty fixed market that you are dealing with so I suppose you can behave how you want (where else can you go?) But I think that kind of service in an employee is just obnoxious. It reflects really poorly on the business.  When I left I thanked the host and told him that the service was the worst that I had ever experienced (and it was). He just sort of smiled awkwardly but did nothing. My 8 year old daughter told me that I shouldn't say bad things about the service because they might feel bad. I explained to her that the only way people get better is with honest critique.   I hope the restaurant gets better when the owner reads these reviews."}
{"text":"Came in and was told it would be 15 minutes for a burger, it's now been 45 minutes and still no food. Avoid. Update: This wasn't worth the wait. Ordered the 101 burger, came with a dry patty and Ceasar with sour tasting Romaine. I wish I had checked reviews before hand."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Slowest service possible ... have been here numerous times but the service never gets better. Don't bother eating here if you are in a rush, no matter how fast you order you will likely fly out before you get your meal. Give yourself at least 1.5 hrs to have a \"quick bite\""}
{"text":"Arrived friday at 5:45. Waiting over an hour for apetizers.  Tables getting up and leaving.  I asked politely to speak with the manager who came out and said hes sorry but doesnt know what the fuck hes doing.  Complete door knob.  Im done with kelseys for ever.  Ordered bread and wings.  How hard is it to deep fry some wings and warm up bread?   Its 7:10 and still waiting.  Wtf!  This is now a complete joke.  Ive never seen anything like this before.  Cara should look into this place and close it down.  They completely ruin the brand.  DO NOT GO TO KELSEYS.  TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to offer identification to the servers here, even if you're in your 60s.  We stopped in for a quick beer while waiting for a flight when the waitress asked for id. I was with a man older than myself and I sure as hell don't look 17. She told us it was their policy to id everyone, that way nobody is \"discriminated against\". I think the argument could be made that everybody is now....  Anyway, they only have one size of beer here and, of course, it's pricey. And I'd like to know the real reason they id everyone, but my guess is they let a kid drink once and management doesn't trust the judgment of the employees in making the call. Hey, I guess that means they're being discriminated against, too........"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The food was totally forgettable (literally) and the service was even worse. The manager of the place somehow intercepted my cousin's credit card on the way to the machine from our server and decided that it was suspicious. She then proceeded to phone Visa to verify it was a legitimate card. I think her first instinct was that somebody was actually eating here. That sounded a few alarms and the fact we had three or four beers must have really put it over the top. Yes, we were on a crazy spending binge after stealing a credit card and our first stop was Kelsey's known for their world famous ... ah, ... nothing. The food is bland and boring and if I was out on a crime spree, I wouldn't be stopping at this place. I wouldn't even stop there to rob it. The manager wouldn't even explain why she was keeping us there to call Visa and she wouldn't give us a complimentary beverage while the situation was being resolved. There were maybe four other people in the whole establishment, but this woman seemed intent on alienating any and all customers she could get. Needless to say, we won't be back. I can be treated like a criminal in better establishments with real food for a lot less....."}
{"text":"WOW, this was the worst \"dining\" experience I've had literally in years.  Went here awaiting my flight and thought I would grab a quick bite, quick does not describe ANYTHING in this place.   I was seated and then forgotten lol servers and people swarmed all around me yet no one realized I had not had even my drink order taken.  After about 15min I was finally asked, BY THE HOSTESS, if I wanted a drink lol.  Ordered that and then about 6-7 min later my \"server\" FINALLY made a surprise appearance!!!  Like some \"pissed-off\" magician she appears, in a cloud of chaos and with a frown upon her face.  I ordered the \"Sloppy fish burger\" and EXPLICITLY said NO COLESLAW on the burger and NO COLESLAW at all in the order.  Ordered fries as my side and I thought I was good to go!  Haha boy was I ever wrong, the order comes back and the burger HAS coleslaw in it, NO FRIES, but instead was a large BOWL OF COLESLAW!!  WTF is going on I think to myself!!??  Is there some hidden camera somewhere?  Is this where a guy on a unicycle comes out and tells me I'm on TV??  Nope, just one more place swarmed with Filipinos and HORRIFIC HORRIFIC service and quality.  I left without paying for anything, the only good part OF this experience and didn't even have enough time left to eat somewhere else before I had to catch my flight.  AVOID THIS OLACE AT ALL COST!!  Eat from the garbage in front of Starbucks first......save yourselves the experience from HELL."}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't good for a thing. I go out a lot so I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly... but this Kelsey's location takes the cake for worst.  We were seated in a reasonable time but walking through the door was the only time we were noticed. There were plenty of servers but it took near 20 mins to be served in a relatively empty restaurant. In that time, we all noticed that our table didn't match the others, it was barely set to standards. It's as if they gave us an imperfect booth so that they wouldn't have to re-do their \"clean\" section. The utensils had food in between a set, others had a lot of watermarks. No water or other drinks for the wait.  We order drinks and she server insists that she give us more time and disappears, although all but one of us were ready to order. She comes back in about 10 mins, and not very suggestive or informative. At this point, we're ready to leave but felt bad to skip out on already placed orders.  We finally get our food and it was nothing impressing. Only one person in their food enjoyed their meal. I myself, didn't touch mine, it was absolutely disgusting and not what I had asked for. I would've said something to the staff but no one was catering to us. After the manager came from another table, she noticed us all just sitting there and staring around, she had actually managed to walk by our table but promptly retract her steps.  She asks us if we're okay or need to go trays. Nothing about how our meals were. She picked up my cold plate and asked if something was wrong as if her face hadn't already went blank from seeing the blood running through my plate. She offered me a new meal in which I hesitantly refused. I was starving but really just wanted a refund to grab Harveys across the lot, but I wasn't given that option... neither of us we're.  Instead we were charged in full, and dismissed like we had somehow insulted them."}
{"text":"Service is usually always great and the food is great!  Probably my favourite chain of restaurants.  Try the 7 layer dip - fried pita (ask for extra, its free!)- incredible I tend to usually come thursdays where its 50% off wings. Who doesn't like wings? And at 50% off - yes please! And they're actually good size wings! Don't try the boneless though - look more like nuggets gone wrong, without the great taste of a real wing.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"It's not like Calgary airport is drowning in fine dining options, so with 45 minutes to go until boarding we went to Kelsey's.  Awful food. Just terrible. Their \"Almost Famous 4 Cheese Tortellini\" should be renamed \"Almost Infamous.\" It's barely cheesy, covered in either undercooked or overcooked vegetables, and for some reason they felt the need to throw in chunks of soft, flavourless bacon. Four cheese tortellini, come on people - focus on the cheese!  I have nobody but myself to blame on this one. Should have eaten before getting in the taxi."}
{"text":"My food was out quickly and surpassed my expectations, glad I stopped by this spot. The prices aren't too bad for airport restaurants and this was a bonus because it's located outside of security."}
{"text":"We went to this Kelsey's location to celebrate an occasion for a family member. Not something I would personally pick, but I was just along for the ride.  I was impressed that we were able to walk in at lunch time, a group of 9 & get seated immediately. I suppose one should worry when this happens, but we were all hungry and wanting to get on with our days.  Service initially was great! Our waitress was attentive and would have drinks refreshed before we were even finished our first glass of whatever we were drinking - checking with parents before refilling the requests from the kids. (Much appreciated!)  Food took longer than it should have to come out. However my wrap was decent, as was my side salad.  Not memorable by any means, but certainly not cringe worthy either.  They lost major points by switching out our server mid-way through. Gone were the drink refills. (I had already drank more diet cola than I should have, so good thing in my case.)  The bill was brought & then nobody came back to take the payment.  We left after waiting for about 15 minutes, leaving my mother (who was treating) & two of my siblings behind. No idea how much longer it took for someone to finally take their payment.  Inexcusable in my book."}
{"text":"I'm not sure of the significance of the 1025 except that it makes it harder to check in :)  This is a local establishment that has been around for as long as I can remember.  As I grew up, many occasions were hosted at this place, from birthdays to going aways.  The layout is neat.  There are two main dining areas, a smaller one at the entrance that gets the lion's share of the windows and then a much larger inner section that always feels a little more gloomy than the aforementioned smaller area.  The bar is cool.  Its on a raised area in the centre of everything with walls and everything.  When I was underage, it seemed like a castle that had to be overcome to enjoy the sweet nectars within....you have to be there to understand....  It had been a while since I'd been here but on a suggestion to meet up in this area, I met some work friends for lunch here.  Of course, I took the opportunity to concern that childhood castle and got us seats in the bar area.    The booths in the bar area are great for business discussions as the dining area actually has people while the bar area is fairly quiet and isolated in the morning.    The bar serves some exceptional...pop on a thursday afternoon.  I didn't get any alcohol but it looked like they had your standard fare with enough variety to pass.  The food was different as I believe they have had a new menu in place since I last was here.  The grilled cheese sandwiches and the buffalo chicken sandwich are done very well and hit the spot.    Service was alright.  Food came out fairly quickly and the refills were done almost naturally.  It was good to get a flash from the past visiting this location.  I will definitely keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Fish n chips  Sweet potato fries Rated high so finding out Also Rickard's Red - great beer! This is connected to the HI."}
{"text":"They closed in March 2013. Service and food were going seriously downhill, not only here but at all their locations. Would not be surprised to see the whole franchise out of business within a couple of years. Shame because they were close to us and once had a great menu and quality of care in cooking and ingredients."}
{"text":"Of the chain restaurants Kelsey's and Casey's are ones that to me are at the bottom of the list.  They offer pretty standard items (chicken, ribs, wings, steak, burgers, fries), but it seems that they can't even get those right.  I ended up here with Ms. B & Dr. Blue Eyes for our annual Christmas gathering on Boxing Day.  We naively thought we would stand a chance getting to Moxie's at the Scarborough Town Centre... on BOXING DAY.  Yes, I suppose we're a bit crazy.  With the line backed up all the way from the 401 exit ramp to get onto Progress Road, we decided to avoid the mess that was the mall and since Baton Rouge (which was formerly the Old Scott House) is equally terrible and more expensive, we settled for Kelsey's.  They were operating with minimal staff with our one server mixing up drinks, and taking orders.  However, there weren't many diners in at 2:30PM, so the service was quite swift.  We ordered calamari and a garden salad to start.  The calamari was pretty good, though the dipping sauce was so thick that our calamari got stuck many times.  It felt like pulling your favourite teddy bear out of the mud.  Yeah... it was that thick.  For mains I ordered the Top Sirloin, grilled to a medium rare.  Mine was more like medium well.  The steak was dry, and chewy from being overcooked.  I had asked for a side salad, but instead they brought me a side of mashed potatoes.  My expectations of this place were so low I didn't bother sending it back or telling her she brought the wrong side.  My dining companions ordered the Balsamic Chicken (which she said was good) and a Chicken Burger with fries (the fries were soggy).  My cocktail, the Spiked Whiskey Lemonade was all soda and very little whiskey.  It was gut-wrenching-ly sweet.  I think she gave me a Cherry Soda Lemonade instead of a spiked whiskey lemonade.  I thought I was drinking liquid sugar.  All in all, the bill came to $100 with tax and tip for our party of 3.  That was with 2 alcoholic beverages, a coke, 3 mains, and 2 appetizers.  Will I be coming back?  Not unless its boxing day again and I can't get in to Moxie's or Milestones at the STC."}
{"text":"I wen't here a long time ago for ufc 94. Nothing I say about this place matters more then this one word \"POO!\" yes thats right POO! some idiot unloaded on the floor of the mens' washroom and said turd mannaged to stay there long enough to be seen but not smelled. Where the heck were the staff on this one!?!"}
{"text":"Not your regular Kelseys  I decided to dine at Kelseys as I didn't want to march all the way across the airport to the Montana's where I had previously had a great dining experience.  I was seated right in the middle of the dining room where anyone could see me, and I was the first guest in sight of the front door.  I didn't really like my seat.  I had ordered the chicken wings, and a diet pepsi.  I got the perception that the waitress was unhappy that I wasn't ordering a bigger / pricier meal.  Still the meal was about $20 including tax and tip.  The wings themselves were ok.  I've had much better wings at the Kelseys near my home and the one near my office.  Its really a shame that this Kelseys cannot deliver the same quality of food as an off-airport Kelseys is capable of.  HMS Host - you have failed again!  Cara Foods should seriously review your franchise agreement."}
{"text":"Our experience here was adequate only. It was a large group (15) that came without reservation, so maybe that affected the evening, however they were not busy, with only one other pair seated when we arrived.   In taking drink orders, people were missed & the same with food orders. To say service was inattentive would be accurate. We started placing empty dishes on a nearby table and put one person on point to make requests as we were near the kitchen and staff had to walk past us.  In terms of food, some had light entrees & many different appetizers to share. One plate was a salad that was reported to be drowned in dressing. Appies included wings (2styles), calamari, popcorn shrimp, nachos, potato skins and spinach dip. The calamari breading was crumbling off and I have no idea why the jalapeños and onions were breaded and deep fried too, except maybe to fill up the plate.   The drinks, when they came looked interesting, particularly the two-handed sangrias(!)   The location was convenient for us, being outside security & was reasonably priced within a middle range for the airport. We chose it because of price, it wasn't fast food, and not finer dining, so I guess we got what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Let me get this straight, Kelsey. I give your restaurant $20 and you give me a meal that I could've made if I just walked across the parking lot and bought all ingredients in Price Choppers? Wish you had told me that BEFORE I gave you my money.  I went to Kelsey's for dinner over the weekend, assured by a friend that it would be good. After ordering dinner and taking it back to my friend's condo, I stabbed her for her error (it was a plastic spoon but it was a violent stab nonetheless!).  Kelsey's is one of those restaurants you might confuse with Casey's, Pickel Barrel, Jack Astor's, etc. In my head, they are all the same restaurant and seem to be on almost every corner in the city. The fact that it was right behind my friend's building made it very convenient to order food and eat it at her place. We had a waiter (I think) offer us complimentary sodas while waiting. I thought that was nice. Still, the atmosphere and special touch are the two stars holding this review up.  I ordered balsamic grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and \"seasonal vegetables\". I put those in quotation marks because for Kelsey's, that means green beans and JUST green beans. I guess they are the only vegetables that are in season! The balsamic grilled chicken should have been called plain old grilled chicken. It also came with a sauce that had no taste. The mashed potatoes were good but I could've made them myself and have had better at other restaurants.  Next time you feel for Kelsey and her restaurants, kick yourself for being lazy, suck it up and go home to cook the meal yourself."}
{"text":"Sat for 10 at the bar, ordered and watched other tables get served who came after me   Waited 20 more and left   Bartender chased me down \"you never paid\" of course not I never got served  Sad"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Better than some of the other places in the airport but that's not saying much. I had the Greek salad with steak and that was pretty good. It was really expensive though- even for airport food. The only salad I would typically spend over $20 on should be topped by something that was born with a shell and claws. This was a $14 salad at best so I would probably have a better opinion of it all-around if it wasn't so overpriced for what it was. Service was friendly enough and efficient but it seems other patrons were getting upset and frequently leaving their tables to go find their server for one thing or another. So this place, like other reviews have indicated, might be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Would never been my first choice at the airport, for whatever reason I always feel like the foods old and dry"}
{"text":"Ordered a peppercorn sirloin burger...  Bread was tasteless, come to think of it, so was the meat.  All in all, a dreary and unsatisfying experience both for my mouth and my body which detected absolutely no nutrient content...  I know it's an airport but.... does it have to be THAT bad???"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I went there for dinner and lunch because it was right next to the Radisson I stayed at while I was in town for a tradeshow. I had a sirloin steak with shrimp and veggies for dinner. The shrimp and veggies were great, but the steak was a little tough. When I returned the next day, I had a Greek salad with grilled chicken. It was $15 and seemed very small for the price. It was tasty -- but I could have eaten two of them!   Overall, an okay restaurant, but nothing special. It felt like a Canadian version of Applebee's, except not as good and with a more limited selection."}
{"text":"AYCE wings on a Sunday, perfect food during the football season especially for Super Bowl Sunday.   These guys might end up losing money if football season was all year round b/c me and my boys have made it a habit to come here on a Sunday. What more could any guy ask for ayce wings, bone in or bone out, aycd, non-alcoholic of course, and football the perfect combination.   I haven't tried the boneless wings yet and most likely won't b/c those aren't wings that's like a chicken nugget pretending to be a wing. There are three reasons I like their wings; the first being that they are a good size, not to big and not tiny. The 2nd is the way the wing is evenly coated with sauce. No matter what sauce you get I find that it has just the right amount put on to it. Lastly, the wings are so crispy, most places I know that put on sauce end up being very soggy, not these wings though.   The one thing I find with Kelsey's in general is you definitely get your moneys worth. The portion size that they serve you is ginormous. For example: if you were to get their pork side ribs the half rack would do you over no problem. There is alot of meat on those ribs and they easily fall of the bone which is great b/c I don't wanna be scrapping off the meat on the bone to try and get my moneys worth like some places, ahem Baton Rouge, Pickle Barrel. If you were to get the full rack your stomach might hurt, not b/c the food made you sick, just b/c there is that much ribs. Also I find alot of times I have to take my food home b/c there is just that much damn food.   The one reason I go to this Kelsey's is b/c of the one server at the bar. Me and my friends always get into a debate with him mostly about sports. I find it really fun and interesting b/c how many servers would argue with a customer who holds how much of a tip he or she gets? If I were to disagree with what he has to say it only makes sense for me to give them a crappy tip. Hey it's all in good fun, I'm coming out there to have a great time, by having a few laughs and arguments and he's doing a great job by making me and my friends feel at home.   Items to definitely get:   - AYCE wings on Sunday  - hot stripe ranch (hot sauce w/ ranch and chives)  - sea salt and toasted pepper  - medium sauce  - golden buffalo (medium sauce w/ hot mustard)  - backyard pork side ribs  - beer battered fish and chips"}
{"text":"Kelsey's food far surpassed expectations based on its rating! The appetizers were high quality and large, the main courses were delicious, and service was quick and responsive! I would I highly recommend Kelsey's for your next stop in the Calgary airport!"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 3/5 Service: 1/5 Dining Area: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Parking: 4/5 Value: 3/5  As others have said, there's nothing special about the food here and the service is hit and miss.

{"text":"Kelsey's is located on 130th in the SE across from the London Drugs.  Spence has been here a while back before and I haven't, so we've been meaning to dine at Kelsey's because we got a gift card at Christmas time but we always got caught up and changed our minds.  But this past weekend, we finally decided to really hit up Kelsey's.  It was about 8PM Sunday night when we were really hungry.  I asked Spence where he wanted to go and he mentioned Kelsey's so we decided to finally go there.  When we pulled up, there was a lot of room to park and it wasn't busy at all.  When we walked in, we immediately got greeted and decided to go into the empty bar.  The nice thing is, they have booths in the bar so it was comfy!  We ordered our drinks which was water and lemonade.  The glasses were really big which I like because I drink a lot when I eat.  We started off with the four cheese spinach dip: creamy blend of cheese, spinach, red pepper and onion topped with cheddar cheese.  You can choose to get the pita chips deep fried or baked (we chose backed).  There was nothing special about the dip but it was good!  The pita chips were warm and soft, and the dip was nice and hot.  For the mains, I decided to get the smoky portobello chicken: two grilled chicken breasts, topped with smokey bacon whiskey mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes, onion strings and fresh steamed veggies.  I thought this was DEEELICIOUS.  I really enjoyed this dish, the chicken was tender, the sauce was yummy, the mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes and the steamed veggies were steamed to perfection.  Spence went with the grilled salmon: grilled salmon served on a skillet with southwestern rice (tasted like salsa) and steamed veggies.  Spence enjoyed his dish, the rice was tasty and the veggies, again, were perfect.   I had a taste and we found the salmon to be a bit dry but all in all, good. Our server was attentive, came by often to check on us to see how everything was and always topped up our water.  After looking at the dessert menu when we arrived, we really wanted to save room because there was deep fried mars bar!!! (always wanted to try for some reason) with ice cream, homemade ice cream sandwiches and some chocolate caramel lava cake!!  There is also apple pie and cheese cake too.   My first time experience at Kelsey's was really great!! Service was attentive; food was tasty and filled us right up.  Our bill came out to be ~$52 and we left happy.  Next time, we'll skip the appetizer and hopefully have room for dessert!!  Ps. The complimentary candy you get when they give you the bill are SOOOO cute.  Miniatures! haha"}
{"text":"It's a neighbourhood bar... and it's a heavy emphasis on the 'bar' part.  Though the website claims they've revamped their menu to be healthier and more options, it's still a bar.  The bar probably takes up about 60% of the floor space.  It's dark here and a lot of aged woods... it kinda looks like Cheers to be fair and that's ok.    I came here for lunch since I got a $10 discount card and the menu seemed to be decent.  I got a simple 'gourmet' salad for $10 while my friends picked up a sirloin burger.  My salad was big, filled with vegetables, and was tasty enough.  Was it better than Jack Astors... yup.  Was it fancier... nope!  It was a better value since they gave more vegetables and it had much simpler toppings but it was better executed.  The chicken didn't taste processed and the vegetables had good herbs on them.  It wasn't over dressed either.  My friend's burger was no worse than Jack Astor.  They're about on par with each other.  There's no pink in the middle, it's not dried out but not really great either.  It's alright for a burger.    Service here was far more 'aware' than Jack Astors.  There's less waiting and we never had to ask for a refill.  They did it proactively so that's a plus.  I will say the waitresses here actually look comfortable in their outfits.  It's not ridiculously over tight or over exposed.  For once, they don't show off more skin on their staff than their potato skin wedges.    The environment is worn like an old comfy shoe which is completely fine and true to the neighbourhood bar environment.  So it's a perfect fit for their market.  For $20, it was a good solid average meal... for the regular price of $30, I'd pass and head to Sprouts, Union Social, or Buka instead."}
{"text":"This place is kinda awful. Food is mediocre and the service is slow. I recommend sitting at the bar, ordering a few drinks and maybe an appetizer, but nothing more. There are limited food options in the airport, so you might get stuck eating here. If you're in a hurry avoid this place"}

{"text":"I arrived at Kelseys and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was fairly empty. No one was there to greet me, however multiple servers made eye contact, and continued to not greet me or anything. After being seated my server who's name I don't know because she never introduced herself said \"do you want a drink.\" I ordered my drink which was from a can and waited a half hour for it because \" it wasn't ready.\" The server proceeded to spill the drink all over my lap. She cleaned up the table before offering me a napkin to clean myself. Then she left the half empty drink there and walked away. She seemed to avoid my table for a half hour because she seemed embarrassed. Eventually my food came, and I had to ask for my drink to be replaced, seeing as I was wearing half of it. Then she left and came back with my \"new drink\" in two seconds. Somehow my new drink was still half empty.  When she brought the food she got the orders mixed up. We switched them in front of her and she didn't say anything. I ordered a big stuffed burger. It was dry and fairly tasteless. Definitely not stuffed. Generally just unappetizing. She didn't ask how I wanted it done, so I guess we assume over done. She brought the check after we asked and awkwardly stood there not giving me the machine for my card, or asking if I needed it. Also she didn't even take the drink off the bill as a courtesy after spilling it and not replacing it.   I would not recommend dining here at all ever. I wish I had gone to milestones next door and I know I will never go to a kelsey's again."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork pizza here. I asked if they could make it a tomato sauce base opposed to the bbq sauce base and they did no problem. Pretty good pizza but I'd prefer a crispier crust however tasty none the less."}
