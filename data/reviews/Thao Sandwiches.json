{"text":"Really dissapointing. I went in for carry out (was just hoping to get a Bahn Mi sandwich). I waited almost 20 minutes and felt that the lady that took my order could have cared less that I was there - she was cold.  The sandwich was tiny (compared to other Bahn Mi I have had) and it did not taste real fresh.   On this one, I suggest you pass."}
{"text":"After Pho Loc burned down (either it did or Chen Wok next door did taking them both out), we have been looking for Ox Tail Pho nearby.  We finally asked the wife's Vietnamese pedicure tech and he said go to Sandwich!    We are glad we did, this place is just what we were looking for!  We left happy after some nice rolls and two kinds of Pho, both of which were delicious.   We were the only non Vietnamese in the place but as we've always found at Vietnamese restaurants, everyone was friendly and service was decent.  The menu is pretty extensive and there are some pictures of sandwiches on the wall, which look delicious.  I'll have to try them someday when I don't have a Pho craving."}
{"text":"Good Food, very nice people, bun nang vit & banh mi Dac biet Yummy. We come once every month,  and always order the same thing. Recommended for new adventurers out there."}
{"text":"My review is based upon taste quality and price for this restaurant. I ordered two things, the grilled pork sandwich and the taro boba. The sandwich is ok by taste but very small in comparison with all the other places around phoenix and the same price as the other places as well. The pho I didn't get due to its price. It's 7.50 for a pho tai. In my opinion it's pretty expensive.  Second the boba was good and very well made but the slushy part wasn't that great. There was too much ice added making my drink watered down and too solidified.   Beside the taste and portion size I would give a higher review if the prices weren't so high. But from the average of all of the different stand point, I believe a 3 star is a very accurate rating for this restaurant and very apparent why I am the only one in the restaurant. In all honestly, from being part of a family business til this day, I am very surprised that this place has stayed open for so long."}
{"text":"The waitress in this restaurant is awful. I would recommend you to come to another restaurant."}
{"text":"So I take my daughter to get pedicure and like most nail salons, it is owned by Vietnamese immigrants. Given my love of Vietnamese cuisine, I am talking to them about various restaurants in the valley and he tells me I must try Thao's Sandwiches.  Nice menu, decent enough place, not my favorite neighborhood...all the things that I love about Vietnamese food I think.  Only really had Pho...It was delicious. Do I need to go on?  Will I be back? Absolutely - I must try their bahn mi. I must try their sour shellfish soup...so many choices, so little stomach. I must try their bun."}
{"text":"Not sure why it's called Thao's Sandwiches. With a name like that i expected really good bánh mì but it was incredibly disappointing. It was okay for what it was i guess but not what i expected. There was barely meat as in when i moved it to one side it was barely enough for a quarter of the sandwich, was not satisfying. Smh. Wish i would have taken a pic..."}
{"text":"My first time going here. I got a regular chicken sandwich. The house mayo was really good and bread was fresh. I love the customer service. She greeted me when I enter and left the restaurant. But, my only dislike about the chicken sandwich was that it had too many thick jalapenos. I am a mild type of person, but I was not warned of the many slices of jalapenos in my sandwich that my tongue was burning. I also thought the sandwich was quite smaller than the viet sandwiches I was use too. But, overall it was a nice hold in the wall kind of place."}
{"text":"Really bad management in this place. order #83 and I got the sandwich. They brought the sandwich and also #11 wich I didnt order. All of the empolyes were saying things in their lenguage and giving me bad faces. It really make me feel unconfortable. Their english was not the best, not sure if they miss understand my order. But was not the right way to handle the situation. I didnt finish my sandwich pay and left."}
{"text":"I've been on a Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) kick for the past month or so.  My banh mi bellwether is definitely Lee's Sandwiches, but Chandler is quite the trek for me, so I've been on the lookout for good banh mi in CenPho.  I read about Thao's Sandwiches here on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch yesterday.  By far, the best part of my Thao's experience was the price.  I ordered a grilled pork (thit nuong) banh mi, and it cost me all of $2.71.  It's hard to complain about anything if you're out less than $5.00.  The sandwich's innards were all delicious.  The vegetables were fresh and pleasing to the eye, and the grilled pork was thinly sliced, as I like it.  As far as the inside of my sandwich, I'd give it 4 stars.    But my favorite part of bahn mi is the bread, and the bread at Thaos did not meet expectation yesterday.  I want my banh mi bread crispy on the outside and soft below the crunchy crust.  The Thao bread was uniformly soft - it was like a Vietnamese torta or something.  And that made me sad.  I really wanted to look past that, but it was impossible for me.  Also, the customer service left a lot to be desired.  It seems like Vietnamese establishments sometimes get a pass on this criteria, but they shouldn't.  I ordered my sandwich, and when I told the woman at the cash register that I was planning on eating it on site, she gave an exasperated sigh, and looked across the restaurant, scanning - it was evident there were several four tops available, but it was almost lunch time, and I think she felt like I'd take up space better used by a group larger than my one-man party.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so I told her I'd take the sandwich to go, and brought it home instead.  Oh well.  So overall, I give Thao's two stars - if the bread were better, I suppose I could have given it a third. But I'll keep on my quest for the best banh mi in town, and likely not return."}
{"text":"I'm giving Thao Sandwiches 5 stars for its Vietnamese food authenticity.   Mi Quang is off the charts so bomb. Just wish they added quail eggs lol but the broth and everything is A1. I also like their Fried Chicken and Red rice (Com Ga Roti) . Sooooo goooddddd !!!    Their customer service...well it's an Asian restaurant what do you expect? Lol you go to Asian restaurants for the food not the service quality lol."}
{"text":"I ordered #23 the spicy beef soup. It was so bad I could only take 5 bites and had to stop before I puked. The meat was about 60% fat and the noodles tasted like they had been soaking in water for a week. The broth had no flavor and there was some kind of organ meat under the noodles. Go down the street to Pho Thanh."}
{"text":"I always get spring rolls and for once I was a little disappointed. Selection is ok. Price was ok. I wasn't wow'ed by this place."}
{"text":"It really seems like a hole in the wall.  Soap operas on the almost snowed out tv, old fan running, and there's only one person on the staff the speaks english.....AND THAT IS WHY THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!! And OMG, I love the sandwiches.  And it's soo freaking cheap.  My bf and I usually order a bowl of pho to share (the portion is huge) and two sandwiches...and our bill is about $10.  [revised review]  So I have decided to take back a star.  BF and I went there one night ready for a great bowl of pho, and then they told us that they didn't have any.  We were fine with that, we just decided to get some sandwiches, then we started seeing everyone around us with bowls of pho!  Lost my faith :("}
{"text":"Oh my, I love their bun mang vit. It's amazingly good because it hard to find a place that cook this dish that great. I'm Vietnamese so I know my Viet dish..."}
{"text":"If you want top notch class service do not come here. The workers and owner are here to give real amazing Vietnamese food. It's a hole in the wall but it is home cooked \"from your grandmas kitchen\" kind of food."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, awesome value.  I had lunch there today (Tuesday September 11, 2012) and it was delicious.  I can't wait to go back.    I had a shrimp dumpling soup, Vietnamese crepe and some spring rolls.  All of it tasted good and was fresh."}
{"text":"Not that good. I got myself a dish later in the evening. I got something with beef. Can't remember the the whole dish, except I can only remember the beef was still raw on the inside. Tread cautiously at this establishment."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. I had the bun rieu oc and it was okay. It's just not savory enough for me. It was too bland for my taste."}
{"text":"This is the place when I tries Vietnamese food 3 years ago and I was hooked. First thing is recommend here is not to have their pho. You will be wasting your money....go somewhere for that. They do, however, have the best spring rolls and peanut sauce. My favorite dish here is the shrimp fried rice, I highly recommend it. You'll never have fried rice elsewhere like the one hey have here. Another one of their good dish I recently tried is their bbq beef combo, it comes with steamed rice with a side of mini soup. It was phenomenal.  This place used to be owned by a Vietnamese guy but he sold the business. They still retained their staff and manage to keep the recipes. This place is a gem for the location it is at. I used to live in the area but moved 15 miles away and still drive here specifically for those two foods. Like I said before, if you are here for pho you will not leave here happy but if you are willing to try different Vietnamese dishes then this is the place."}
{"text":"That's Sandwiches is a small Vietnamese Restaurant in Central Phoenix. This is a hole in the wall kind of place that isn't the cleanest. (see photo) They do serve a few dishes that you seldom find at other Vietnamese Restaurants like the Red Rice Chicken that you can wash down with an herbal drink called Penny Wort. Some of the menu and dishes posted on Yelp for this restaurant seem to be no longer served such as the interesting sounding Mi Quang (rice crackers, scallion, pork, peanut, bean sprouts, shrimp, mort della, morning glory and saw tooth herb)   I tried the Red Rice Chicken. I received a half a tiny chicken that was lightly seasoned and was tasty and very crispy. The red rice was really orange and had lots of carrot in it along with sweated onions. The rice was plump and chewy. The rice had very little flavor on it's own but they served a smokey spicy thin brown sauce on the side to spice it up. This dish also was served with a cup of seasoned chicken broth.  The woman who took our order didn't check on us or give us our check. (we had to pay the man up front) We were also the only ones that didn't get chop sticks.  To sum things up the food overall was Okay but I am unhappy with the dirty floor they had. I got there about an hour after they opened. Who knows how many days the floor was dirty. If they don't care about the front of the house who knows what's going on in the kitchen. I am being overly generous with the three stars because it's a small business with low prices. (The Banh Mi Sandwiches run about $3.50) We thought the food we tried was Ok.......  The air conditioning also isn't working well.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I get in these moods where I just crave certain styles of food.. lately Ive been on this Vietnamese kick that has lasted for the past 3 weeks.. I think maybe in a past life I was a beautiful Asian woman!! In any case I took my co-worker Ruben to a place I just so happened upon online.. its called Thao's Sandwichs.. we walked in and found that we were the only non Vietnamese in the place.. all eyes turned on us.. Oh hell yeah, this was a VERY GOOD SIGN!!!  This means the food is going to rock my world and my tummy!  The place.. just awesome! We both had Banh Mi as well as Pho.. piles of fresh veggies and chiles.. loads of sauces, hoisin, sriracha as well as chile paste and soy.. the Banh Mi had one of the best crusty French rolls Ive had to date (sorry Saigon Sandwich) with ample fillings and an out of this world taste. I had the Pork Roll and Ruben had the special. Special was loaded with Vietnamese style meatballs (not the chewy ones) and covered with cilantro, chiles , pickled carrot and daikon..  We moved on to Pho.. I had the everything Pho including beef brisket, tendon and tripe.. in a delicious beef soup that wasn't salty as some other places tend to focus on.. seems to be quite a bit of complexity in that there soup! Then fishing around in there found all of those wonderful rice noodles.. then started covering it in Mules Ear, chile and Thai basil.. so many complex flavors all with a harmonious balance and aroma! Ruben played it safe with just the lean tender beef Pho. He can be such a daddy's little girl when it comes to new food experiences.  The one thing I would complain about was the fact that they were out of Boba and I settled for a Leche Choobee, it tasted like soap.. I think Dove to be exact.. simply vile.. I think the Choobee was alright, I may try it again some other time but without the Lyche!"}
{"text":"I called in and stated,  \"I have never been to your restaurant before, what is your best seller\".  Employee: wha wha rechuraant?\" She then passes the phone to a white man I repeat myself:\"I have never been to your resturaunt before, what is your best seller\".  White man-\"don't you have our menu\". I just say forget it and order the shrimp fried rice for pick up.  When I get to the restaurant the white man that took my order is standing at the door and gives me a half way hello. ( you know, the kind of hello you get when you are supporting someone's business while black). The customer service from that point on was decent.  The fried rice came with four shrimp. ($15.00)The egg rolls were good but the dipping sauce taste like someone pissed in it.  After I ate the meal I got that immediate feeling of nausea. I had to play mind games with myself to not vomit violently. The food must have been dirty."}
{"text":"Soups are NOT very good anymore.  The new   ownership made changes to the place.  Prices are raised by 25% and higher on other items.  The food quality has sunk to a new low. Food is not even worth the old cheaper price, so I definitely not happy about paying more.  The new owner bought a new POS which is expensive, but he forgot to invest in bleach to clean the place.  This place is very dirty.  You can see the dirt creeping up the chair legs and table legs. \"Gross!!!\"  I don't understand, the POS system is thousands of dollars and bleach is only a dollar a gallon.  It shows the he is more concerned with his bottom line, instead of the welfare of his customers."}
{"text":"This place is authentic viet food! The red rice chicken and bamboo chicken soup is what this place is known for by the locals. Clean mom and pop shop in the corner of a marketplace. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like their Vietnamese ice coffee and their ice tea is jasmin :) how ever their pho is super oily and floating w thick coats of oil on top of the soup visiblely, their shrimp wonton egg noodle is good though.  So 3 stars , service is good"}
{"text":"First time trying Vietnamese food so I really didnt know what to expect . I ordered Bánh hi chào tóm. The vegetables were very fresh and I really enjoyed it. I ordered a coconut choobee and it was so good. There is a cashier who is so friendly and makes you feel so comfortable."}
{"text":"This place has really bad service and the food is barely decent, I would advise not to dine here. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm tired of trekking to the east valley for Lee's Sandwiches.  Thao's hit the spot. The marinade for their grilled pork is excellent, very flavorful. I was surprised to see that they are a full service restaurant, offering pho and a variety of plated meals too."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho! Everything is fresh and full of flavor! The restaurant itself it rather small so it is very busy but the food is worth the wait.  The number 12 beef pho is only $7 for the huge portions."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure, almost always get the same roasted chicken with red rice.. They make the chili pepper sauce in house, and i always add an fried egg for good measure Sometimes we do family style and share dishes, haven't had a plate I didn't like. Ask for a side of broth if you feeling a little squirrelly"}
{"text":"In big red letters outside their building it says \"SANDWICHES\". So you would think their sandwiches are pretty good.  Well I ordered the club and unfortunately it was not very good.  The bread was stale and the meat was very fatty.  Looking at the other meals that were being served looked good, but was not impressed with the sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho, huge portion with lots of fresh sprouts, basil cilantro, limes, scallions, and meet. I got the rare beef and meatball version. The broth was quite flavorful. I also got a chicken sandwich which I'd never gotten at a Vietnamese place before, and it was awesome! Packed with flavor and toppings, and the bread was nice and crusty/soft.   Lost a star for being pretty dirty. I didn't really want to touch anything. I would not eat there."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time yesterday. We were greatly impressed with the food and the service. We love Vietnamese food and have eaten in many restaurants over the years including several at the Eden center in northern Virginia, DC, Philadelphia, upstate NY and Ontario, Canada. We had Bánh xèo and Bánh mì. The two of us split the former and had one of each of the latter. That made for a very satisfying lunch for less than $12. I prefer the Bánh xèo crepe crispy and this was. The bean sprout, shrimp, etc. filling was right on the money and it came with the appropriate mint leaves, cilantro and Romaine lettuce.The sandwich rolls were very good too. We didn't try the pho but it looked exceptionally good. Spring rolls also looked great. The other dinners were a diverse group with about 60% appearing to be Asian. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've tried many Vietnamese Mom and pop restaurants but this is the best place for bun bo hue"}
{"text":"Was it me or was their buns a little dry? And I'm referring to their 'banh mi.' The expectation from every Viet shop that sells this is whether the baguette is going to be crispy, chewy and fluffy--you know, the warm out of the oven freshness!   The automatic benchmark to use when comparing little mom-n-pops to is typically Lee's Sandwich, the notorious sandwich chain known for consistent, great tasting banh mi's.  If you are Asian and never heard, you clearly have been living under a rock.    I don't usually expect the little places to produce uber awesome baguettes but it needs to satisfy a few criteria as stated in the beginning of this review.  The second factor goes to, well, the filling like the meat and vegetables.  I had ordered the usual special Asian ham and meat with the pickled veggie fixes--you know, the daikons, carrots, cilantro, and jalapeños.  Nothing too spectacular in that department.  The freshness was a little questionable, but tolerable.  The paté spread was not as tasty as one would expect.  Situated in a run down shopping plaza, the store front was sufficient and attractive enough to deceit banh mi cravers like myself. BooHoo, yes, I cried myself a river. *sarcastic*  The place itself is quite small, could hold maybe 30 patrons? Being that it was a sandwich shop, it made sense that they had a big, colorful menu with pictures of their banh mi's with numbers assigned.    As I finished ordering my egg rolls, I rolled my dices and tried their mango smoothie drink.  I pretty much played the 'giving you the benefit of the doubt' card.  Boy, talk about ordering wrong.  Being that I trust and rely solely on my taste senses, I did not detect any fresh mango of whatsoever, except sweet cream after sweet cream.  Not only that, but they topped it off with whipped cream to compound the issue.  As I sat waiting for my to-go orders, I observed that it was not just a sandwich place but also a place that serves Pho and other Viet items.  Maybe I should return to try their Pho? On second that, nah.  Based on my disappointed experience with their sandwich, I have an itchy feeling I would expect the same fate (especially asking a good friend of mine who had it once and gave the thumbs down).  The service was fine, nothing to talk about there."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, wether it was the old or new owner. It's my go to place for the last 5-6 years. I love pretty far but will still drive here to eat. I love the fried rice, and spring rolls. They are mostly known for their red chicken rotisserie rice!"}
