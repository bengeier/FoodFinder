{"text":"Friendly Italian restaurant offering attentive service, home-made pastas and daily specials. Good selection of wine."}
{"text":"Fantastic little known gem at Bloor and Islington. It's run by an Italian family who came to Toronto 9 years ago and brought over their recipes. Service is top notch. You're greeted as you come in, the servers and chef make several stops by your table to chat, learn about you and your party, and ensure that everything is going well. Didn't notice any difference in treatment depending on whether you're Italian or not, which I've seen at certain restaurants. The food was probably the best Italian food I've had in Toronto. Other Italian restaurants that I've been too are more or less Americanized these days, so be prepared to be pleasantly surprised with this one. The bread was homemade as well as the pasta dish I ordered. One can tell the difference in quality the second they bite in. Wine selection is pretty good too.   This is a restaurant where it's clear that the owners put love into what they do. Stop by and enjoy."}

{"text":"Very authentic Italian restaurant with nice, homemade foods. Some of the dishes were a little bit lacking in flavour, but the ingredients were very fresh and everything was made with care. The service was fantastic though, which made for a very pleasant night."}
