{"text":"Not as great as Pho Dau Bo's sate beef Pho but pretty good, we also tried the shrimp and wonton egg noodle soup. They also have thick rice noodle soups, so more options than a standard Pho place. Most everything under $10 so can't complain on price! The spring rolls were particularly tightly packed but otherwise acceptable. Minimal strip-mall worthy decor. Good service, only two tables of people when we were there on a weeknight."}
{"text":"This new place is in the same place as Tre Viet and man am I glad they changed owners!
I've already had lunch here twice and both times were amazing; in fact, I think this might be my new favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the area. 
I've had the vegetarian vermicelli and tofu sub. Both were very tasty. The vermicelli was packed with stuff: spring rolls, veggies, tofu, and peanuts. I'm actually not sure what item this is in their menu but they are very open to making changes. For instance my friend asked to have char-broiled chicken on another vermicelli dish and they were very accommodating. Will definitely be back for lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"Horrible...I used skip the dishes and they got my order completely wrong...I ordered lemongrass beef and got satay beef....was so greasy it was rather gross...giving one star as I had to."}
