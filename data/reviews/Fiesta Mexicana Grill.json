{"text":"Not sure why this place is so overrated it's simply as good or as bad as any of the other run of the mill Mexican joints around charlotte. Was made to seat in a booth with torn seats, but I won't complain as long as the food is great. But it was the usual stuff though the portions are really huge. They have some family meals which I believe would good bargain. I would say it's a value for money restaurant with average food. But the $3.99 margarita was bad it wAs just ice and water and lemon. Hardly any tequila in it."}
{"text":"Fiesta Mexicana makes the BEST tortas and a lot of great authentic mexican food. Literally when I started eating my torta, I couldn't stop, it was just tooo good."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!!! Waitress was great too, lucky find I was in town from Philly on some business and the place was fantastic"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly people. First time there and we had so much fun. Got kids? Have balloon hats made for them. This guy is great."}
{"text":"Very fresh, scratch-cooked food that is surprisingly bland.  Lunch buffet is a worthwhile bargain.

I ordered the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet which runs until 4 p.m. for $7.99, and mom ordered the chile rellenos dinner for about the same price.   We left pleasantly full and WITHOUT that heavy, slighly-sick, ugh feeling that often follows a Mexican dinner.  This restaurant desperately needs to add a highly-flavored, HOT salsa, at least one bilingual American employee, and a little Latin music instead of the TV noise.  Then, I will be a total fan. 

Real, from-scratch cooking happens here.  The nasty, fakey, pre-packaged flavors true of so many other Mexican places were replaced by simple, very fresh food flavors.  They even make their corn tortillas from scratch!   The buffet is reasonably extensive and was freshened constantly even though we got there at 1:40 p.m. Surprisingly, the buffet had real melted white cheese, so it was possible to kinda go wild with it.  Yum.  Everything looked clean and the entrees looked appetizing.  The lettuce was surprisingly fresh and nice.  The wait staff was helpful and brought us what we wanted once they understood what we were saying.  Mom's plate had two big, cheese-stuffed poblano chiles that looked beautifully cooked from scratch.  Loved the freshly-made corn tortillas.  The salsa was home-made, but totally mild and bland.  Again, a home-made, chunky, HOT salsa is desperately needed as an alternative.

My heart cries out for hot peppers and flavorful, marinated meat!  Sigh.  Not here.  Everything was nicely cooked and tasty in a bland way.  A few spicy tweaks would make a vast improvement.  The chicken dishes were good, but the beef needed marinating or something to add greater depth of flavor in the cooking method.  The beef tasted like it had been boiled.  Next time, I am bringing my own hot sauce.

Decor is modest -- typical Mexican decorations with some nice murals on the walls.  The dining room is small with a few tables and booths and what appears to be a separate banquet space next door.  Bright paint outside is festive  and the free-standing building's design is pretty inviting.  Trim paint outside around the door needs a touch-up. Plenty of parking right at the door.  Somebody needs to tidy the carpet underneath the table after clearing each table.  Sitting on top of food litter on the carpet undercuts the impression of cleanliness that was obvious with the buffet.

Huge language barrier problems.  Only one person seemed to speak English at all, and even she did not always understand what we were saying.  We resorted to pointing and acting out what we wanted (e.g., sawing motion for needing a knife).  

There is a lot to like about this restaurant, though.   It is the freshest, most promising Mexican restaurant I have visited in Concord so far."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place.  We have eaten in all of the local Mexican restaurants and this one is the best by far.  The food is always fresh and full of flavor and the staff is just awesome!  This place is a hidden gem!  You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise. On our way through Kannapolis we yelped restaurants and stumbled on this restaurant's reviews. Not always a believer of some yelpers this one was worth the visit.  Chips and salsa are fairly standard when sat but Fiesta also included a cilantro jalapeño salsa and queso. Our server was friendly and attentive so much so that our teas were never close to empty. 
Alambres and Steak Mexicana were ordered and devoured. Beautifully marinated and seared steak with perfectly grilled onions and jalapeños. Plates included salad, guac, beans and on point rice. 
The manager was polite and asked how if he could do anything for us. That is customer service. When we told him everything was great he offered an additional tomatillo salsa to try with our chips. Fantastic. 
They rightfully earned new customers today with their customer service and friendliness. We'll go back for sure to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Frozen margarita $3.99 special-must drink. We had Pollo Carnaval and Arroz con pollo. The portions were of decent size and flavorful."}
{"text":"Man, the tacos were autentico y delicias! This place is now right up there w Andele as my two fave Mexican joints. Salsa is fresh and awesome and they also bring cheese dip right out to you with the salsa right off the bat! Need to come here more often:) Just wish they wouldn't have Jerry Springer showing on TV:("}
{"text":"We treat ourselves to a meal out a few times a month. This is a great choice with authentic Mexican food. Great prices! Good service! Nice size portions! I've had the buffet and regular menu items! Both were great value! Great midweek specials and drink specials! IMA regular there now!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte!! They bring out queso and two types of salsa from the start. The green is spicy while the red is more of a standard salsa. The chipotle sauce on the chipoltle burrito is amazing. Get extra on the side! The grilled veggies are so fresh and perfectly seasoned. They still got a crunch (not over cooked to the point that they are a soggy mess). The red enchiladas with beans were good also (more of a simple meal if you're looking for basic Mexican). Also the service is amazing. Our server never messed up on anything and was very nice/smiling/in a great mood. And the restaurant is clean. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight. It was amazing! Very delicious and fresh. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly cheerful service and fresh authentic food!!  I was amazed that EVERY person working there was smiling, including the cooks!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Queso comes with the chips! Had the tequitos and burrito verde, both were delicious"}
{"text":"Mexican is my fav!  And this place is not far from where I live. The food is pretty authentic  and the prices are reasonable. They also have a buffet option which I have never gotten but it looks very good."}
{"text":"There is good reason why this place has 5 stars: it is hands down the best Mexican I have had on the East coast! Who would have thought the best Mexican would be hiding in Concord NC?
The food: I ordered the Enchiladas Rojas and the fiancée ordered the Enchiladas Rancheras. We were given a choice of meat (Chicken, pulled chicken, steak, or pork) and each decided on the pork. We were each expecting pulled pork, but instead got nice, meaty, pieces of pork chop. It was wonderful! And you can not beat the price. I got my draft Modelo and she got a Pineapple soda. Our total bill was $20! I only wish Fiesta was closer to Lake Norman. This spot could easily become a weekly night out."}
{"text":"Love this place, like to go here when we are feeling like going south of the border... The food is very good and they give you enough that you will have enough for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"We have found our favorite Mexican Restaurant!! This place is great all around from the service to the popping flavors of Mexico with generous sized servings. My family and I highly recommend this place. We encourage you to give it a try. Just be prepared to want to return many times again"}
{"text":"Very pleased with this find!!! I'm a Texan married to a Californian and finding Mexican food that we both enjoy in North Carolina has been a struggle. This has been by far the best Mexican food in 3 years of living here!  My only complaint would be I wasn't crazy about he margaritas.  Probably personal taste.  Next time I'll just order beer!!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I love this place!! we go for the margaritas and end up staying for everything else!! everything is authentic Mexican/latino cooking it is absolutely delicious! Ive lived in LA for several years and coming here I was surprised to find that was so good prices are extremely reasonable service is extremely helpful as you go I definitely definitely recommend that you try anything and everything I heart desires!  Except the fried corn rolls just wasnt a fan.  But wow very very good 2.50 margs wed thur fri!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We typically go on Wednesday night when they have $1 street tacos with your choice of pork or steak. We also love the $1 drafts of XX. We have also done their lunch buffet which had a good selection of Mexican Food favorites. Most of all we love the friendly and courteous staff. Every waitress is great and the service is always fast. I could go on and on just know this is a great little family owned restaurant and we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Legitimate Mexican food! My friend and I agree that it is the best Mexican we've had in North Carolina. We are both from California and had been searching for this spot for a few months! I've had a variety of items and their carne sada and camarones are full of flavor! All things pork are amazing in my book and they have chorizo and roasted meats down pat! I'm definitely a regular there!"}
{"text":"Lengua taco is better here. I've tried around Charlotte at different restaurants and they just don't taste like this place ( but still looking). The street steak taco has def approved! I don't like there regular beef tacos 
The chili rellenos, vegetarian dish is Awesomkay! The best I have had in Charlotte. The downfall is their lime margarita which is their specials.$2.50 great price, crappy taste. I've tried 5 or more times but the taste just gets worse -watered down, not cold... Um bad. 
There has been major renovations inside which is cool, bathroom stall has one for ladies and one for men, and their menu has upgraded. Food does taste better. It's still our fav mexi place!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY GREAT STUFF here at Fiesta. There aren't enough good things to say about this place, but I'll give it a shot.

The most obvious \"pro\" is that this is truly authentic Mexican. I am ALWAYS on the search for great authentic meals, and this takes the cake. The food is absolutely, hands down, the best in the area, and it really does pain me to say that because I have probably spent a small fortune giving my business to Zapata's for the past decade or so. The quality is clearly matched, if not better in some aspects.

GREAT PRICES. Makes any dining experience enjoyable knowing that you are getting this GREAT FOOD at GREAT PRICES. 

Their lunch buffet is great, it's a small spread, but there are significant options.

Awesome specials. Margarita specials EVERY DAY.

I definitely appreciated the fact that cheese and tomatillo sauces provided free right off the bat. Their service is generally just ok, but the staff is incredibly friendly and genuinely aims to take care of you.

Don't let the hole in the wall exterior fool you, there's some fresh atmosphere and décor up in here too.

Check em out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast attentive service. 
The food was very good. Had steak nachos, chicken fajitas, and a quesadilla. Each item was served hot and everything tasted fresh. Very big servings. Waitress kept the water full and checked on the table often."}
{"text":"We have been searching for authentic Mexican since moving here, found it here. No order by number menu, lots of choices, great service and huge beers!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Mexican spot and this is it. I've tried many Mexican food trucks but this restaurant is the best. My husband and I eat for under $23 with tax. Very flavorful and I always have to take some food home."}
{"text":"The best carnitas I have ever had. A must try for any pork fan. Don't forget to ask for the grilled jalapenos too. They come with the carnitas por libra but you have to ask for them."}
{"text":"Fabulous mexican food! We've been twice so far. The first we had a service issue with a new waitress but the manager Victor made everything right. This is place is great!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. This place is awesome. Very inexpensive, great quality food. Drink specials most nights $2.50 margaritas and $1 beers. Awesome. Love it and great for all you Mexiphiles."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this resturant! We were looking for something new so of course I look to yelp for help. This place absolutely deserves five stars! Wonderful service, great drinks, and the food was amazing! Deliciously authentic without being overwhelmed with spices. This will be a weekly stop from now on!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Mexican Restaurant and we finally found it! The salsa and cheese were fresh and tasty! Hubby ordered steak fajita, I ordered the chicken enchilada with salsa verde, rice & beans and it was delicious! We also ordered the Frozen Tex Margaritas... whoaaaa,  you want to go home with a nice buzz? these are IT! Best part, it was sooo reasonable and we still had plenty to take home. Oh yeah...we will definitely be back! Best service ever!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go, when you want some good authentic Mexican food. I ordered the 3 soft taco combo, with 1 steak, 1 pork and 1 chicken. I can say, that these are some of the best tacos that I've ever had. The meat was tender and juicy, and you can tell that everything is made fresh. The prices are easy on the wallet and the atmosphere is nice as well. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The most amazing, authentic Mexican food I have had in a while. I had the Burrito California and the mole was fabulous. Large portion so I have lunch for tomorrow. The jumbo margarita was great! Service was great! I will definitely make this a regular."}
{"text":"Picked this place just from Yelp and it worked out great.  Menu has some nice options but for my first visit went with chicken fajitas.  The large serving for one is enough for two but you would need more tortillas.    It was all done great and the staff (good job Anna)was on top of things.  Will be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great food, good portions, friendly staff and a great experience overall.   It isn't fancy, but it's very affordable and well worth a visit.  You can eat lunch for $5, and margaritas are only $2.50"}
{"text":"We have been passing this restaurant for years. Finally stopped in for dinner last week. The service was fast, the complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and delicious, and the meal was flavorful, fresh, and very tasty. I will definitely be returning very soon. Keep up the great service and quality!"}
{"text":"Great service, clean with great food.  Waitress was very sweet and really good at her job. Best Salsa Verde ever!"}
{"text":"Find somewhere else! The lunch menu featured a taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was good but the enchilada had less than a teaspoon of cheese in it. I pointed it out to the waitress and showed her the minute amount of cheese. She asked me if I wanted a side of cheese. I asked to speak with the Manager. She sent me the cook. He argued with me and said the cheese melted. He was not professional or courteous. The place needs to be steam cleaned. Lots of loud children on the weekend. Stay away."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  I'm honestly not sure how this place has gotten as high of a rating as it has gotten.  Went for the lunch buffet.  Absolutely no dishes were labeled, the selection was minimal, dishes were empty and not refilled and it was nowhere near the end of the buffet hours.  Staff was for the most part nowhere to be found.  The restaurant itself is not that nice looking and one half of it was burning up and the other half was cold.  Was not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD in North Carolina! If you crave inexpensive authentic Mexican food then this is your place! I would have never tried it if my manager asked if I wanted to add to her to go order. Now I've got my parents addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"My husband has a love/Hate relationship with this place, at times it's good and other times it's bad! But Gabby is always nice to us regardless and the mañager always fixes there mistakes!"}
{"text":"My dish is very disappointing. I think they served m drowned nachos with no pop of flavor. Never again! I'm willing to bet money that their workers gave them a 5 star rating because it's far far & very far from a 5.

I forgot to add. My boyfriend had two shrimp tacos. He had to clean them because legs & shell were still attached!

Out water was the best tasting substance on the table during our visit. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!  You get free queso and the prices are so reasonable. The food is delicious. We are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! We've seen this place for a year or more from the gas station across the street and finally tried it. 
I was surprised to see a full five stars on Yelp, but it's well deserved- everything is fresh, from scratch. Fresh chips, spicy salsa verde, gratis queso blanco dip, generous drink sizes. I has the huevos con chorizo, only $7 for a generous portion, with wonderful flour tortillas and rice, and awesome refried beans. I'd stopped eating them at restaurants years ago, opting for pintos or black beans - think they're typically from a five gallon tin, but these were obviously fresh from scratch, light- not weighed down with lard or whatever is typically in them! The rice was awesome, too - no overbearing tomato paste in them.

Like others have said, friendly waitstaff, kept checking on us and offered to go sodas. ;)

One easy way to impress me as a Mexican restaurant is to have seafood, and even more so ceviche (both of which they do), but even more so, to have quail, which they do!

I'd love to come back with a larger party to try one of their Family dinners, they sounded delicious- we will definitely be back here, and expect to eat here with us for Mexican if you come to visit!

Music was a little loud for a bit but they turned it down when asked - more awesomeness!

One last vote of confidence - when I come back, I will try the menudo!"}
{"text":"I figured this would be your typical Mexican restaurant but I was wrong. I had the shrimp in chipotle sauce, and my boyfriend has the steak and chicken dish. Very good and he is picky so that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Visiting Concord area from California. We took a chance eating at Fiesta and found it to be the best Mexican food we have eaten east of the Mississippi. GREAT food and Great service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have found since moving to CLT. Large, large menu. Everything I have had is simply delicious. Large portions, moderate to lower prices. There is a weekday buffet at lunch and daily specials. Went with friends and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great food, the finest and freshest ingredients keeps this restaurant in a league of it's own.  The staff, price, specials, and location make it a slam dunk choice for Tex-Mex cuisine in Concord."}
{"text":"About as true to real Mexicana as you can get!
The Mole is made fresh from scratch and you can taste the time put into the sauce. Street tacos are great. 
Prices are very reasonable and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a Mexican food connoisseur. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and this place is the best you're going to get for the area. We stumbled upon it after looking for a place near us and boy am I glad we did! The food is phenomenal, I couldn't have been happier. We ordered too much because we couldn't decide with the intentions of taking a lot of it home but that didn't happen. It was so delicious we ate pretty much all of it! I recommend the fajitas and the verde burrito. The meat is seared just perfectly in everything with that little bit of crunch on the edges, mmmmm, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Anna was our server and she was amazing. We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The reviews are true - this place has the best Mexican food in Concord.  We went there for the first time last night and had great service and an abundance of terrific food (fajita meat/ veggies even better as leftovers on our salads today).  Queso was terrific.  We ordered guac and it was very fresh (reminded us of Texas), and the fajitas were delightful.  We will return - very glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Well well well. When I heard about jumbo margaritas for $4 my mind was made up that I had to come here. I GPS-Ed my way here only to discover that I knew where this was (right behind QT) and had come here yearssss ago.

There were a lot of cars out front so I took that as a good sign. $1 tacos happen on Wednesday and i figured that was why. They give you queso when you get there... lit, off to a good start.

$4 is only for house flavored and on the rocks. I wanted strawberry and frozen and it was like 1.75 more... no big deal because it was DELICIOUS. Probably the best margarita I've ever had. 

To my surprise the only kind of tacos included in the special were steak and el pastor... no thanks. 

I ended up getting enchiladas rancheros. - 2 beef 3 chicken= 4 disappointments. They lack flavor and were pretty dry.  I probably should have just gotten a regular price taco since they weren't expensive but I called myself being adventurous.

Anywho, this place gets busy and family filled once it gets after 6/7 so come early if you want some peace."}
{"text":"You get 2 kinds of salsa plus free queso with the chips. I ordered the chicken flautas which were delicious. The shell was so tasty, it had the perfect texture almost like a pastry. The flautas were covered in cheese dip. It came with rice and I ordered beans instead of guacamole salad. The refried beans were so good, definitely not from a can. My husband ordered pollo chipotle. Chicken smothered in a creamy delicious chipotle and queso sauce. Everything was fresh and authentic tasting. The service was polite and speedy.  They also had a lunch buffet which was extremely popular so I could see that nothing was sitting around for long. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, fresh tortillas, fresh tomato and tomatillo salsa. Authentic Mexican and very reasonable on price. Looking forward to returning to try the buffet."}
{"text":"I am glad that Fiesta Mexicana surfaced on the \"best of\" list this year, because we had been a couple years back and I had managed to forget to write a review. The whole time I was headed back for lunch, I was thinking we had been, but I knew I would have written - it's not like I skip reviewing places (it might take me a while, but I get there eventually), and they weren't even bookmarked to review.

Anyway, we pulled in, and sure enough, same place. No biggie - I can always do with another Mexican place in the rotation. One nice change - or something I did not recall - is that they serve a small bowl of queso with the chips and salsa (and two kinds of salsa too, double bonus!). Staff is very friendly, and happy to chat about their history. There was another restaurant there years ago, but it was - perhaps - Italian, so it seems that I just forgot. Sorry.

As to the food, definitely fresh tasting and some nice spins on your standard Mexican options. Also plenty of your typical fare as well, so all in all a good choice if you're in the area. During the week they even have a buffet for lunch if that's more your speed."}
{"text":"We have returned to this place multiple times and each time the service and food are great!  The buffet has expanded and seems a little bit different every time we come.  We love the variety!"}
{"text":"So good! We just moved to the area and we are so happy to have found this little gem. Typically if I want Mexican food I just cook, but the huevos and chorizo I got were definitely worth leaving the house for. It came with rice and beans and I will echo another reviewer by saying the rice and beans are more authentic than some other places we've been to in charlotte. The corn tortillas that came with my food were really good, tasted fresh and handmade. My partner got the burrito Verde based on some reviews and he gave it two thumbs up. We got our food to go and it was just as good as if we would've had it there. We saw on the board that they had some drink specials like a pitcher dos XX for $5.99 and house margaritas on the rocks for $2.99...something else we will try in the future. Will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food  this guys serving.
In first visit I had a good experience.
Then I  invite my friends about this location.
Very economical value for menu.
I  love in it."}
{"text":"This place is always good and fresh. First off it is one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever seen. The hard chicken taco is my favorite and the kids meals are a great deal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, huge portions of delicious food!! I had chipotle steak burrito and my BF had the chipotle chicken burrito, both amazing!! And.. Jumbo margaritas only $3.99!! WOW!! Free queso, verde salsa and salsa with complimentary tortilla chips.. Nice, authentic Mexican, colorful atmosphere.. I would definitely come back again and again!! Topped my former favorite Mexican restaurant in Salisbury, el patron.. Great prices, great food.."}
{"text":"About 5 years ago, I ate at this place and had such a bad experience, dirty dining area, poor decor, crappy food, even worse service, so i wrote it off and vowed never to be back.  I recently kept hearing about how good this place is from everyone from my handyman, to my fence guy, my mechanic and so on, so I figured I would give them a second try.  Hey, its been 5 years, maybe something has changed......UMMM...understatement of the year..fully renovated interior, large wait staff, clean dining area and very flavorful and nicely priced food.
  2 people ate 5 tacos and a chili relleno, plus 2 drinks -- all for $15....and it is fresh, home style and authentic.  Try getting 2 greasy burger meals from a fast food joint for $15, probably wont happen.
 Some reviewers have had issues with the buffet, i cant comment on that since i have yet to try it, but would like to at some point.  
  This place is now my new favorite mexican restaurant in the area, I will be back over and over -- I am looking forward to trying out the $1 taco wednesday."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, excellent customer service at a very reasonable price. I look forward to my next meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the greater Charlotte area.  Drinks  Food .  Service and music amazing.  House made corn tortillas to die for.  Don't pass on this spot."}
{"text":"First time here. Wanted to try because of reviews and I truly Love Mexican food! I enjoyed my plate Steak and Shrimp. I even tried desert Fried Ice Cream. I enjoyed it but my mom got very sick! Severe cramps and diaherria for 24 hours. Probably will not be returning. I will just have to keep looking for my perfect place."}
{"text":"Not from the area, decided to stop by after reading the great reviews and we were pleased. The food was on point and service was outstanding! The frozen margaritas were the highlight of our night, they were amazing. Will definitively stop by again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We go here all the time. They give you queso with the salsa and chips... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in this area. First off, they bring out queso, green salsa, and red salsa with chips complimentary.  Yes, I said complimentary queso. 
The portions are huge, fresh, and delicious.  I love the pollo loco quesdaillas...they have bbq sauce & pineapple in them.  Yum! My boyfriend gets their burritos, and always leaves happy. 
If you drink, the beers and margaritas are uber cheap...and HUGE!! 
I've been there for the lunch buffet, too.  It was good, but I prefer ordering a specific entree."}
{"text":"Anytime you are within 20 miles of this place you need to detour and have a meal. Hands down best Mexican I have had since coming to NC. Prices are great....portions are huge, service is always helpful and nearby and drinks are very, very reasonable."}
{"text":"The best restaurant that my family has eaten at in a long time. The food was delicious, the environment was nice, and we had excellent service from the time we walked in until we left."}
{"text":"Amazingly Fresh and Flavorful Mexican Food! Wow!! What an Amazing surprise while visiting friends in Charlotte. Ok, a bit of a disclaimer...When I visited Fiesta I was absolutely famished. My friends and I had just spent the entire day hiking and didn't get to Fiesta until 9pm. Needless to say by that point, if it was edible I would have enjoyed myself somewhat. So take this review however you like.... But with that being said...Boy was I surprised by Fiesta.

First off, the first impression a Mexican restaurant can give to their customers is their chips and salsa. Fiesta chips were thick and heartily, and by themselves were delicious to eat with their slightly salty but Rich corn flavor. But the real stars were the 2 Freshly made Salsas AND the free Queso. Yes, that's right...I said Free Queso! Fiesta Queso was just right, creamy and salty with real bits of jalapeno sprinkled throughout the mixture. But if that wasn't enough, their housemade green and red salsa we're super fresh and just jammed packed with flavor. The green salsa was actually an avocado sauce, which is essentially salsa verde with avocado pureed throughout the mixture. This gives this acidic, cilantro & lime heavy mixture Body and Creamy richness. Ha let's just say I polished off a basket and two hard of salsa before my food even arrived ;) 

But the Entrees is where things really took off. Still quite hungry, I went big and got an order of chicken fajitas, 2 Leguna and 1 Carnita street tacos (corn tortilla, onions, and cilantro). First off, the tacos. Honestly....I don't think I've had better Lengua tacos. Lengua (or beef tongue) can be difficult to do well. Beef tongue is a tough piece of meat, so you have to cook the meat a long time to break down the tough fibers while also keeping the meat moist. Not an easy task for sure. But Firsta seemed to pulled it off with flying colors. Super beefy, tender, and just the right ratio of lean and fatty meat. Definitely a Must Order. The carnitas were also a fantastic. The classic, yummy fatty pork that was pan-seared to give it a nice crust and interesting texture contrast. The chicken fajitas themselves were also good, but honestly they just became the vessel to enjoy the Best Part of my visit to Fiesta.......Their freshly made, In-House tortillas.

Wow! Ok, so obviously Freshly made, In-House tortillas are going to be better than the thin, cheaply made tortillas you get at the store. We all know this. But I could not have imagined how much More these tortillas added to all of my dishes. Body, texture, flavor, Structural Integrity.....Soo many things I never really thought about until I visited Fiesta. Honestly, I think I'm spoiled now. Not quite sure if I can ever really praise a Mexican dish unless it is prepared with freshly made tortillas. 

Overall, you need to check out Fiesta. I'm just disappointed this little hidden gem isn't in Indianapolis :("}
{"text":"It feels like you've been transported to Mexico. The chips and salsa are great and the dishes taste authentic. Its worth going."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to soo many! From the moment we walked in we were greeted with the friendliest staff which continued throughout our time there. The food was extremely flavorful and super inexpensive. The margarita was perfect! I would highly recommend and will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, music  enjoyed each and everything  authenthic mexican food, my fav mexican spot from now. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"California burrito was awesome, wife had street tacos, all very good. Drinks were plentiful. Service very good. Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is very good and filling. When they bring you your chips you they also bring free cheese dip with it!!The waitress was very friendly and was at our table plenty of times to check on us.. I also must add that they have very reasonable prices we will be back!!"}
