{"text":"I went here not expecting much and got a lot more than I bargained for you can tell they use good quality meat the service is great and the price is excellent I would definitely recommend people here best taco stand in town"}
{"text":"OK so let me just start by saying that I literally drive 20 miles just to eat at tacontento.
My boyfriend (alberto)is very very picky with he's food and I would never thought he would give a food truck a try,but he did and let me tell you guys that he is addicted!!!since we live soooo far from this food truck we go once a week and every single time the food has been amazing.
The guy in the register is super nice,the ladies cooking look very clean and have the passion to serve the best of the best.
Do I recommend this location? Oh absolutely! They have so many choices of meals and meats to accommodate anyone's appetite.

Keep up the great work/food tacontento! :)"}

{"text":"Hidden gem in north las Vegas.  If you are ever near Texas station, hit them up!  Sooooooo good."}
{"text":"Drove by one night to try their tacos and we also shared a Huarache. The Lengua and Al Pastor Taco were good, but the Birria on the Huarache was very tender. Try them out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The price is great, the customer service better, and the tacos OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Handmade tortilla, and a tasty flavored asada.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants their taste buds to thank them."}
{"text":"ill just drive another 5 minutes to Tacos El Gordo next time i want tacos."}
{"text":"Good, friendly service is not something I've come to expect from a taco truck, but El Tacontento delivers service with a smile almost as big as the grinning, sombrero-wearing taco painted on the truck. I drive past this newer taco cart on my way to work, and one thing convinced me that I had to try it: the name! This stand in the parking lot of a tire shop across from Fiesta Rancho and the Westwind Drive-In Theater recently replaced another mobile vendor with not-so-memorable tacos and a name I can't remember.

I requested a veggie burrito and was offered pinto beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, salsa, and crema inside a large flour tortilla. The rice was well seasoned and the Mexican-style sour cream made it even more delicious. I'll be back for this burrito for sure. My husband ordered a taco de birria and proclaimed it very tasty for his first time ever sampling birria. He was given a choice of corn tortilla: regular or fresh. Of course, he opted for the freshly pressed and griddled masa. Our total? $5. They offer bottled beverages, but I'd definitely like to see some horchata or other aguas.

The man and woman who took our order and prepared our food were so friendly and helpful that we will certainly return for mas tacos y burritos. Gracias and cuatro estrellas for El Happy Taco!"}
{"text":"So I was really hungry one night an I was in the area then I seen this taco truck on the corner so I decided to stop by an check it out. Not my regular place but I must say they were pretty good an I will return"}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch I ordered 2 chicken tacos which were more bone than meat and the rice was burned. Never again"}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is the best in LAS VEGAS... F@#$ Tacos El Gordo and PEPEs tacos... Plus the customer service is a big plus here. I am from San Francisco and it has been hard finding a good taqueria.. Hands down on this place.. The tacos are made with hand made tortillas. I totally recommend this place. We go once a week. The owner and his wife are so sweet and remember their customers names. Great place to get a fast service.. Their champurrado is awesome.."}
{"text":"Yum!  So glad I checked Yelp (yet again) when deciding where to eat tonight.  I've seen this taco truck several times on my way home but am always sketchy about which ones are good since there are so many!  The photos on the reviews were awesome and I saw that I could call to place a to-go order.  The woman who answered spoke very clear english and explained to me what a Huaraches was.  I'm glad I decided to try it.  SOOO tasty!  I got the carne asada one and a carne asada taco.  Everything was very fresh and delish.  I can't wait for the bf to get back in town to take him there.  They're going to be getting a lot of to go orders from me!  :)"}
{"text":"B E S T T A C O S *I N* L A S V E G A S!!! You need to try this place if your looking for delicious and authentic Mexican food!! The location I always goto is the one on Vegas Dr. & N Jones blvd. It's inside of a gas station which I was skeptical about at first, but don't let that fool you!! This place is AMAZING & the customer service is A+. They're prices are good & affordable, & they make your food in a timely manner, so if your looking to spend your money anywhere, do it here!!!!!! Please make sure you $TIP$ them, it's well deserved & the way they always greet you with a warm smile should never go unnoticed!!! Shout out to Alvaro & his girl for always making me & my family come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot. The prices are normal for food truck tacos here in nevada. But their service and food quality is top notch. Lets just say they are not stingy with their meat or salsas. They have salsas out for you to choose and take if you get togo. Everything is fresh!!! Lucky for me it's not too far of a drive away. Love that they are open later hours than other places. The only downfall is that it's hard to find parking.  If you haven't tried it you should. Beats tacos El Gordo and their $2.50 tacos. This place never fails me."}
{"text":"The first time we drove by El Taconento was on a Sunday evening and we were bummed to find out that they were closed. On our street taco scramble this past weekend, they were opened, and they had a small group of people waiting for their orders which was also a good sign.

Run by a husband and wife team (I think) they have a nice selection-Tacos,Tortas, Quesadillas, Burritos and something no other vendor offers, Huaraches(Slippers).
They also offer six types of meat selections-Asada, Lengua, Cabeza, Pollo, Al Pastor(He has an Al Pastor Carousel inside) and Birria, another thing no other vendor offers.
Traditionally made with goat, Tacontento's version is beef, kinda sorta like picadillo(if you had Cafe Rio's Chile Roasted Beef, it is very similar to that)

So we shared a Taco de Al Pastor, Taco de Lengua,($1.50/each) and a Huarache de Birria($5) The al pastor had very good flavor with nicely charred bits, and the lengua was oh-so-soft and tenderlicious! There's nothing like a fresh handmade tortilla, and this is the only way tacos are made here .

The Huarache is a 1/4-inch thick by 10-inch oval of masa that is griddled to perfection
topped with beans, meat of your choice,shredded lettuce, crema Mexicana, and Cotija cheese.Just as good as the ones I've had in the streets of Cancun, and much tastier than the huaraches served at Los Antojos. Wait times vary, depending on how busy they are, but if you are patient, the food served up here is definitely worth the wait. easily becoming one of my favorite street vendors...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Awsome tacos hand made tortillas authentic mexican food in vegas awsomeeee...better than tacos es Gordo hands down. Not greasy  at all flavorful."}
{"text":"Had tacos and a Buritto hear last night I must say bomb. I had pastor and a chicken burrito nice size had made tortillas. I went out of my comfort zone to try tripes it was so good I'm going to get some more tonight."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had so far in Las Vegas. So so so good! Reminds me of the good ole days roaming around east LA late night, except this time I'm sober and I can actually taste food. Handmade tortillas, how do people live without this?? Pickled red onion whaat?! Kracie, What is this place?"}
{"text":"They Do accept Credit Cards and Debit!!
Would be 5 stars but $$$. 6/main item ie burrito, quesadilla, each dish etc."}
{"text":"Burritos cost 6 dollars each, Tacos 2 dollars each. Asada had no seasoning. The burritos were bland but hearty portions. They are not a ripoff but also not that great."}
{"text":"Ok everyone there is a new taco place better than Roberto's better than PEPe tacos this place is amazing they just opened up on Jones and Vegas drive there in the gas station but trust me you will not have any things so close to home authentic Mexican food the best cavecia I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I have always been sketchy about food trucks/stands. But this one takes it. Their meat is always well seasoned. The taco trucks I have tried have either been too salty or too dry. This taco stand is my favorite by far. And what better than to have home made tortillas!  I am a regular customer and have never been disappointed in their food. They are very nice ppl and will always make sure our order is correct. I also like that we can add our own topping. They always have a \"help yourself\" refried beans pot as well. Definitely recommend to any taco lover out there"}
