{"text":"Great coffee, nice staff, good atmosphere. I haven't tried any food here yet but will be back soon to try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in from out of town and it doesn't disappoint. Had a white chocolate mocha and butternut chicken wrap....  OMG are they good. My fiancé doesn't drink coffee and even he loved it. The owners are great guys!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fillmore Coffee Co has the best Açaí bowl I have ever had. In fact, It is better than the one at Kaleidoscope. I came back to study due to its great atmosphere. There is plenty of seating and a very comfortable environment to study in. Today I was recommended the Cold Brew by itself. Personally, I am someone who thinks black coffee is a disgrace, and admire those who can actually drink it. Surprisingly though, this cold brew really is perfect just by itself. 10/10 recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was semi decent.  - the barista made my coffee and saw me sit down, but when the coffee was made he never called my name and it got cold.  - the coffee tasted like folgers. Honestly disgusting coffee  - I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which was decent, but not worth $8  - parking is sparse and you're limited to only 2 hours (even on sundays)  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the Italian panini and it was cooked perfect. Great flavor!  The furniture was really nice especially the the black bar stools against the wall. The water had fruits in it making it very fresh tasting. Definitely will be coming back. Owners were super nice and helped us out today"}
{"text":"Love this place! Used to live at the Skyline Lofts and I am so sad it wasn't there while I lived there. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. The iced Chai with almond milk has to be the best Chai I have had yet. The food is also really tasty. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty upscale looking place.  Don't really know much about Phoenix, but I know it really isn't busy during the summer, so it was nice to just come in and relax. Tried the Bulletproof coffee with grass fed butter and coconut oil (Google it) and got a lesson from the worker there.  Would definitely come back again..."}
{"text":"Seriously such a great place to meet for food or chill solo. Great Baristas, owners are super rad and everything on the menu is A+.  For sure stop in."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for a beautiful, peaceful interior, great baristas, and delicious drinks. However, 2 stars off for the food... I've had the chicken panini and the caprese sandwich/panini on more than one occasion, and I've been disappointed in the lack of flavor both times. Also, there were bugs flying around in the glass container where food sits. It was disgusting to see. However, if you stick to drinks, GREAT PLACE. Loved their iced chai tea."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee, yummy and interesting food choices! I got the breakfast burrito and was pleasantly surprised by all the flavors. They don't have a huge selection for food, but what they do have they do well! I like the space, too. Lots of seating and some comfy couches, mostly quiet if you want to get some work done."}
{"text":"A fabulous place to either grab a cup of the best coffee in Pheonix or enjoy something from the menu for either breakfast lunch or dinner. The breakfast burrito was outstanding as indeed were the scrambled eggs. Tristan and Mike as the owners are the perfect hosts supported by some great staff.  Tristan comes from  Canberra Australia while Mike comes from New York - a great combination of nationalities producing a unique style and ambience. Very much worth the trip downtown to experience the place."}
{"text":"As a downtown ASU student, I'm seemingly on the lookout for walkable, local spots to refuel on healthy food and good coffee. Fillmore was my savior today! From the ambient, sun-filled dining area, to the cheery, and equally sunshine-filled staff behind the counter. The mood music is loud enough to hear and low enough to not be a distraction, a real bonus for a student trying to get some work done. I had a delicious almond milk Chai latte and an acai bowl (reasonably priced at 8 dollars) that was jam packed with tasty goodness (granola, honey, ripe strawberries, banana, raisins, shredded coconut, and Chia seeds). I couldn't be happier with my decision to set out and explore a new coffee shop that can satisfy a proper breakfast. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered acai bowl. Big portion.  Betty tasty with cut crunchy and chewy texture.  No coffee today but looks like they know how to pull a nice espresso."}
{"text":"Never been much of a coffee drinker because I've only ever had Starbucks Coffee and it just tastes like burnt beans, but I decided to give this place a try when I got off work and it's delicious!! 2nd day visiting and both times I've had very pleasant experiences, the staff is very welcoming and very good at what they do! Will definitely keep coming here after work :)"}
{"text":"I'm a coffeehouse addict and I'm very picky about quality food, coffee, and atmosphere. This place has all 3! Delicious and somewhat healthier fare is available here. The coffee itself is full of flavor but not burnt or bitter. And I love the clean but still cozy, bright but still intimate feel of this local cafe."}
{"text":"Always great customer service and the best coffee! They have really cool menu items, great food munchin and sippin joe! #fav"}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly hip looking coffee spot but the espresso shots were too strong and acidic. It honestly didn't taste any better than Starbucks to me. The food prices were very fair for what you get but my husband and I thought the beans were very mediocre."}
{"text":"This is such a great coffee shop! Very spacious to sit and do some work. Super friendly staff, very welcoming. I was in town visiting, but could see most of the customers who came in were regulars who had great rapport with the employees.   The brekkie scramble was SO flavorful, I ate the whole thing! Many things on the menu include goat cheese :) wide coffee selection, staff was very knowledgeable on this end as well."}
{"text":"Fillmore Coffee Co is an excellent place for a variety of coffee beverages and also a great place to study and hangout. I have enjoyed their black coffee and latte.The location is in downtown but quiet which provides a great space and atmosphere. If you want to avoid the crowding of Lux on central, this is a great place to spend some time by yourself or with friends."}
{"text":"I have been going to Fillmore coffee since it opened about a year ago and love everything there. The food is amazing from the acai bowl, from the cookies and muffins, to the breakfast sandwiches and paninis. Because I am not the biggest coffee drinking, I enjoy the fresh brewed teas and one of the owners, Tristan, makes the best chia tea I've ever had- although whoever makes the chia tea, it's always amazing. When I am in a coffee mood - My favorite coffee drink is the cold brew with heavy cream and vanilla. Hands down the best coffee shop in Phoenix, maybe even in all of America!!  Best foods, drinks, employees, and wifi."}
{"text":"So many choices! From coffee to pastries! Even if you're wanting to lunch there's food too!  I was finally able to try an affogato and it was pretty good! The vanilla sweetened the espresso ever so slightly, but I have to say their chai was the main star though! It was perfection.  The location is a little weird and hidden but if you want good coffee you'll find this awesome gem.   Their decor is so cool and trendy! There's definitely plenty of local art work hanging. And the plants!!! I just wanted to take all of them home!   Anyway long story short it was a good experience I will definitely be back for some more chai! Haha"}
{"text":"Awesome interior and food. Great place for a casual date or to study at. The bright environment definitely creates an upbeat feel, yet the calm music and limited environment definitely helps to maintain balance.   The food is a bit overpriced, which seems to be the only downside. Paid $8 for a breakfast sandwich that was mostly bread, but it was still tasty. However, their baked goods were well worth the cash. Freshly baked chocolate chip muffins were the best I've ever had. Th coffee here was outstanding, but again reflected in the price.    Finally there are board games on all of the tables, so you can hang out there all day and kick back."}
{"text":"This may be the best cold brew I've ever had. The owners / operators of Fillmore are just the nicest and clearly run a coffee shop they are proud of, from decor to quality of food and drinks. When I left San Francisco, I was a bit of a coffee snob and worried about the options in Phoenix. I feel really lucky that Fillmore is right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I only purchased an iced coffee - and it takes a lot of effort to screw that up, so this review won't be much help regarding the quality of the coffee.  However, the atmosphere wasn't too bad. The place definitely seemed much larger in the pictures. I didn't feel as isolated as I was hoping for. The good news though is that the spot was kind of tucked away (seemingly off the beaten path) - so, there was not a lot of people. I also loved the industrial design.   Great spot to study or work remotely. On a Tuesday afternoon, I was able to camp out for about 2.5 hours and get some work done. I'd come back if I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding espresso. Possibly the best in the Phoenix area. Five well-earned stars for it.  Knocking off a star, though, for the açai bowl. Good, but could be better if the açai blend hadn't turned to soup before I was served. The flavor was excellent - and the toppings were on point. Just wish it had been a thick smoothie instead of a runny juice."}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend and I were visiting Phoenix found this place from Yelp. I'm really glad that we found it because it's so open. Really like the natural light and white walls which made the place really spacious. Really love the art on the wall! I guess it's a local artist that only lives a block from the store(?)...  I ordered a cafe con panna which took a while but only because the barista made fresh whipped cream. And, the breakfast burrito. Really, really loved it!! It was so good and surprisingly sweet in a few bites but was it was really spicy with the jalapenos. Fo me, I don't think I needed the salsa on the side. It was great as it was! My friend ordered an iced cafe mocha and the pasta salad which she really enjoyed. If I were ever back in Phoenix, I would love to try something different from their menu!!"}
{"text":"Fillmore coffee is the perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and relax. Its a local place with coffee (and prices) better than Starbucks. Also the tomato-onion chutney they server on their breakfast sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, modern setting and a great selection of healthy food and drinks. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was traveling for business and needed a place to grab breakfast and check emails. Fillmore is a great little spot in downtown Phoenix. It was a short walk from my hotel and has free WiFi. I had a excellent breakfast burrito packed with spinach, eggs, and goat cheese. The coffee was pretty good. This is a great little spot!"}
{"text":"PROs:  Really great egg and bacon sandwich, great espresso and americano.  If that was all we got, I'd give them 5 stars.  Staff was friendly, ambiance was nice.  CONs:  The iced mocha we got was warm, not nearly enough ice, but the worst part was the smoothie we ordered, they should just remove them from their menu.  They don't have the right equipment to make them, half of the smoothie was crushed ice, and it was super bland so they didn't use enough fruit, and I had to sweeten it myself.  I couldn't even drink it, and I'm pretty tolerant to mediocre stuff when I'm hungry/thirsty.    Suggestions:  Use frozen fruit to replace your ice, get a VitaMix or something equivalent to actually have a smooth smoothie.  Use a natural sweetener like agave or honey, but kudos on the almond milk and base selection."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop near ASU. Had a latte and an Acai bowl that were both great. I spent a few hours working on my laptop and enjoyed the vibe and natural lighting. Really nice staff. Free wifi."}
{"text":"I was happily surprise by Fillmore coffee. I ordered a London fog as I was in the mood for tea, the barista didn't know what it was or how to make one, but he tried anyway, and I appreciated the effort! It didn't turn out well but I think that's because it was more an experiment than actually showing coffee. I love it when baristas are fine with attempting something they haven't before. My friend got an iced mocha and it was very tasty. I definitely need to come back to try their coffee soon! The decor is very nice and there's a TON of space in this shop. It feels very wide open."}
{"text":"Just had a large coffee and and an acai bowl. Total was $12. Large coffee with an extra shot of espresso was very good, strong, and flavorful.  The acai bowl was $8 and it was large with blended acai, sliced bananas, strawberries, and granola. In fact I thought it was too large...I would like to see a small version of it as I had trouble finishing it! Also, could use more granola. All the coffee and food choices looked good and fresh."}
{"text":"I was riding the school shuttle and noticed this little hidden coffee shop right by the ASU downtown campus. I decided to visit it! Fillmore Coffee Co is two months new and has a hip atmosphere! It is the perfect spot to sit and study but also has options to have some fun by providing games all over the place.   The customer service here is great. All of the baristas were friendly to me and made me feel very welcome. Shoutout to Austin for giving me the run down of the place and letting me sample a flat white!   I ordered a small iced hazelnut latte. I love it because it was really bold and mild sweet with a creamy finish. I was super hyped up after that!   The only thing I would suggest is that they would dust the corners by the outlets because there was a big spider by the outlet. Eek! Other than that, I love this place and want to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Mike and his business partner have done a great job. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this coffee shop. The coffee is outstanding, they have free wifi with lots of seating and outlets, cozy couches, outdoor seating, great food and pastries (I got the blueberry scone which was amazing), and an overall chill/cozy atmosphere. Plus, they have games and are dog friendly!  Everything is just so cute, even the little touches like the dinosaur and dog shaped pepper and salt shakes.  Come check this place out! It's find be a new regular spot for me even though I live in North Scottsdale... 100% worth the drive"}
{"text":"Nice coffee! The space is very open and designed well. The açaí bowls were nice given that they're a coffee joint and not a juice bar! Super good and I recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good latte and mocha. The sourdough toast is great too! Between the two people working there, I would prefer the lady making my drink though. Much more skilled and dedicated.;)"}
{"text":"Super cute coffee spot with lots of tables and outlets. The food is also pretty good as well. Very open with lots of light. Wifi password is fillmore99  definitely would recommend as a study spot or even a spot to meet friends for coffee. The only issue is parking, which is limited to mainly meters but that's everywhere in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I liked their breakfast sandwich more than the coffee. Great service, easy parking right next door."}
{"text":"Great hang and chill spot. I got an acai bowl that was perfectly cold and sweet (plenty of bananas). Awesome outdoor seating. Definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from Fillmore Coffee. In the same area there is a starbucks and all of my coworkers go there. I really just don't get it. Fillmore blows them out of the water. Their coffee is out of this world. The ambiance is more laid back, not as loud, and the staff is awesome!!!! I normally get the cold brew coffee. It's amazing!!!! The taste of the freshly roasted ethiopian beans is out of this world. You really taste the coffee and it is not bitter. I always go here when in need of my morning coffee fix. I recommend it if you are in the area! Also the owner is really cool and friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellence food and atmosphere!  We had the acai bowl and breakfast burrito and they were fresh and delicious. Very empty on a Sunday morning but I'm sure it's popular during the week. Definitely returning on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this shop, the coffee, and the people! The owners Mike and Tristan are both awesome guys, and have done an awesome job creating a premier location for coffee. Great vibes, music, and personality - all around 10/10.   Their Cold-brew always hits the spot for me. Also, they turned me on to Bulletproof Coffee (when it is rarely cold in AZ), which is awesome!   Whether you're taking a break for lunch, need a morning coffee, or studying for school you should give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We went to this place because we had an online coupon. We ordered food and coffee and they were both really good. The Americano I ordered was nice and hot. It's in a great area and the interior is nice. Could use a little more study spaces but that's just being petty. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"Still don't drink coffee.  A coffee spot selling paninis?  That I can get on board with.  At least that was my mindset when I set foot into this relatively new Downtown Phoenix establishment.  Fillmore Coffee is the brainchild of long time coffee house buffs Tristan Davies and Mike Atwell.  In addition to the coffee, Fillmore dishes out sandwiches, wraps, salads, baked goods and other stuff.  While this coffee house dining formula isn't necessarily new, its one that has worked out quite nicely at other coffee spots I've frequented such as Teapot and The Coronado.  So on a Tuesday after work I wandered into Fillmore's shop on the bottom floor of the Skyline Lofts Apartments.  The long slightly narrow space definitely has an urban industrial feel to it, but nevertheless the setup is quite comfortable and laid back.  Most of the clientele I saw inside was unsurprisingly the Downtown college crowd, laptops and all.  There's seating for about 30-40 people inside with a mixture of group table, high chair, bar, and living room seating.  The main menu board up front has a somewhat limited but respectable assortment of options for pretty much any time of the day.  For my first trip, I chose the Chicken Panini.  Came with a choice of regular or salted vinegar chips (I went the boring route and got regular this time).  Total cost including tax, $8.  If you want water, they have that for free behind the main counter.  I know that coffee spots tend to have a pretty laid back pace and everything, but I was pretty annoyed with the wait time this go around.  There wasn't a huge contingent of people coming in and out so it shouldn't have taken them too long to make my sandwich and bring it out.  But in this case it took more than 15 minutes for my sandwich to come out.  No bueno.  When it did come out I was a little surprised as I was kind of expecting something that looked as if it had come right off a panini press.  That said, the bread was still plenty crunchy and the sandwich was quite good.  In addition to grilled chicken, the specs on this one include pesto, tomato, mozzarella, and what tasted like a tomato onion puree.  Nice mix of flavors.  Overall, I was happy with my sandwich and I liked the layout of the restaurant.  And for the price, a good satisfying meal after work.  Super convenient location if you're a Downtown ASU, UofA, or NAU student.  My main beef had to do with the exceptionally long wait.  You can judge for yourself how many stars you'd dock in my shoes, but hopefully this is an area this still relatively young establishment can improve upon.  As for the coffee, I'll happily defer judgment on that to you, the coffee drinking public."}
{"text":"I stopped here by chance during a visit to the U of A Phoenix medical school campus. I immediately liked the casual vibe and the excellent music. I ordered a chai latte which was surprisingly delicious. It tasted like wonderful eggnog and was served in a 12oz glass, a size that was perfect for the sweetness of the drink. The guy working the register was really nice and gave me some recommendations for where to have dinner. If I end up in Phoenix, I will definitely be coming back here. It seems like a great place to hang out and study, too. The wifi was fast and there were plenty of tables and comfy chairs."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the coffee is good. The decor is wonderfully hipster. I'll definitely be back soon with some friends!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee cafe. It's so sleek and stylish with delicious coffee and love the variety of their food menu. I usually have my regular: the Chicken Panini and a tasty coffee. Great service and such friendly staff. Often when I ride the Light Rail to downtown, I often stop in since it's near a stop and take in downtown sights and sounds while enjoying a coffee. Cheers***"}
{"text":"I had heard about the acai bowl from other reviews and tried one. It was a large portion full of acai, granola, fresh strawberries, bananas and shredded coconut. Very good."}
{"text":"This biz traveler did not want another hotel breakfast and heaven forbid the in room coffee maker. Yelp helped me find this gem a short walk from my hotel. The breakfast burrito is not your usual bb and it's marvelous. Coffee is grand and service is friendly and helpful. I guarantee my return before my flight back home!"}
{"text":"I check out coffee shops most Sundays. This one is fantastic. I had an americano and an açaí bowl. Both delicious! My girlfriend had a dirty chai latte and one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever tasted. Service was great. Inside is clean and modern. Love it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very conveniently located next to the parking structure off Fillmore. Lots of room inside and a delicious Donut Espresso!"}
{"text":"COFFEE! Great, personable service and a delicious pour-over (choice of several single origins or blend) in a proper mug!"}
{"text":"My office away from my office! Great place to be able to have coffee and get work done. The food is great and just the right taste to go with any drink. I also like bring my friends here when we want to hang out and drink some coffee."}
{"text":"I took my son here and was a great space to work and eat. The staff was great. Amazing coffee too"}
{"text":"Avocado goat cheese tomato toast. Fresh, fast and huge portion. They should probably charge more. I got an iced coffee and it was simple and not bitter so I was happy. Crowded but not much wait."}
{"text":"First time here! I had the grilled chicken panini which was delicious! And an iced coffee. The coffee is clearly roasted and brewed well. But the extra cherry on top was how friendly the wait staff was! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Fillmore is a pretty nice place to study at, for sure. Lots of seating, and tables, as well as the bar area. The staff is not not the friendliest (not rude at all, just not usually very personable from what I've experienced). I believe the owner did take my order once, and he was awesome and super friendly!!! I usually get their chai's, but they use a powdered chai which does not mix well into cold drinks, at all. It does seem like they have pretty good food though- i tried their veggie wrap! I do wish they were open later, as the do close at 7 everyday, but overall i enjoy doing my work here. It's pretty quiet, clean, and has a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Best. Coffee. Ever. I live in Orange County, California and every time I visit Phoenix this is a MUST stop. Fantastic coffee, you have to try the cold brew-life changing. Food is great and the customer service is like no other. I always feel welcome and at home here, and look forward to every visit to Phoenix thanks to this great spot!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and plenty of space. Very large, with many places to sit and study. When I went to order the guy was very nice, but because there were many customers and only one/two-ish people working, it took a very long time just to get an acai bowl for my friend and an Ethiopian pour over for me. My friend said the acai bowl was a little sweet. The coffee was very smooth and pleasant. I think it was made well, though i am no expert. we stayed for 4ish hours, so it wasn't a big deal that it took long to get our orders.   bonus: there's free parking in the garage next to it, 2 hour visitor parking"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Sheraton for a conference and ate here every morning. The açaí bowls were fresh and delicious and their coconut lattes were tasty. Nice vibe to the place and the cleanest bathrooms with a little shelf in the stall to set down your keys, wallet phone. I'll miss you Fillmore!"}
{"text":"Finally a nice place to hang at Skyline Lofts building. Nice space, good service. Great Coffee, nice healthy snacks and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I feel like they sell themselves short by just identifying as a coffee shop. They also boast an incredible menu and this is definitely a go to lunch or hangout spot for me. The service is always fun and the people are laid back and super kind. There is a lot of space for seating, ample plugs, couches, tables to spread out and do work, and great fast wifi! I absolutely love ordering the grilled cheese sandwich here! It comes with a sweet and delicious chutney and it's on perfectly crisped and buttery sourdough. All of the food and drinks I've had here are incredible. Go here now!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Breakfast burrito was amazing, made fresh on the spot, excellent ingredients, gourmet in my book, wow! Was just looking for a good latte, got a great breakfast, as well. Thanks guys!! Also, they have very nice atmosphere, good for a solo trip or with friends, great place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely cannot say enough nice things about this place.  It is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Downtown Phoenix.  The atmosphere is extremely friendly and inviting - I've never seen a customer walk in and not be greeted with a smile.  The staff is accommodating, speedy, and personable.  If you're somebody who sometimes works from home, studies, or are just looking for a place to have a meeting, Fillmore is the place to get everything done.    Plenty of outlets, free wifi, and the best menu.  I highly recommend the mediterranean salad and the acai bowl.  As someone who is gluten free, I appreciate the plethora of options and their flexibility to make certain items GF.  Sean also makes the BEST hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Fillmore Coffee has easily become one of my favourite coffee shops. My friends and I were initially just looking for a nice place to chat on a weekday afternoon, and we fell in love with this gem. The spacious interior has a variety of seating options, such as barstools for a work/dining bench, individual and group tables, and comfy couches, all with nearby outlets. The outside seating area is along the sidewalk but still far away enough from pedestrians. It's a comfortable place to get work done or just sit and people-watch over a cup of coffee or tea. I love how relaxed the atmosphere is, created by the broad window that lets natural light in throughout the day and the quiet music in the background. One of the problems I've come across at other coffee shops is loud or too upbeat music, but the music taste here is good and keeps me productive.  I've only had a few iced teas here and their acai bowl, which is absolutely delicious. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but their acai bowl has me pretty hooked."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly, the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. My favorite things on the menu are the iced chai and blueberry muffins. The sandwiches and breakfast items are great too and worth the wait for the freshly made items!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, food, and staff!  Wonderful addition to Downtown Phoenix local business coffee shop! Highly recommend to stop and try their signature wraps!"}
{"text":"The best cold brew I have ever had!! Also the best chai I've ever had! Haha I can't get enough of their breakfast burrito and avocado toast. The staff here is also really friendly and fast! I've been coming here for a couple months now and I've always had a great experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had a couple things ordered on ubereats a couple weeks ago, a breakfast sandwich (dry and bad) and the sourdough toast with avocado. Unfortunately, the toast was so burnt it was inedible -- and I tried. If I continued eating it, I would've just torn up the roof of my mouth. I called the restaurant and whoever I spoke to (Australian or New Zealand accent?) told me he would have a manager call me back. Nobody called me back."}
{"text":"I love This place: First of all , every time i have visited this spot employees are very friendly including the owner which i have met personally.   I Love and support small business like this, because they focus on taking care of the customer.   They have a good choices of healthy breakfast. They also offer delicious real fruit smoothies.   The best part is that their prices are pretty reasonable .  This place offer free wifi and really cool couches and tables to relax and chill with friends.    The music they play while i am shipping at my coffee is amazing  and relaxing."}
{"text":"Barrister was very nice, received coffee with a smile. Liked my cold brew and hubs latte, plus I bought several pastries. We were pleased with all and when we return to the Symphony we'll be back for more treats & caffeine.  I took all to go but it looked comfy and cute enough with some art about."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good variety of coffee, friendly knowledgeable staff and a trendy vibe. Their cold brew coffee is fantastic. I Would recommend this place if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Lovely little coffeeshop in downtown Phoenix.   Friendly staff, ample seating and great selections for breakfast. Had the avocado toast, the acai bowl and the breakfast burrito on return visits. Delicious espresso drinks with nice alternative milk selections.   The avocado toast was my favorite - crunchy bread, feta cheese, a little salt and a layer of avocado.   Also tried a chocolate croissant - yum!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for the first time around 9 pm on a Friday night. We were greeted by a welcoming barista, and had plenty of options for a comfortable place to relax. The coffee served was perfect, nothing burnt, nothing watered down. And when a group of hooligans came in and started to accost a lone customer, the barista promptly and firmly removed them -- and when they continued to disrupt business from outside, the barista stood his ground and cleared them from the premises completely. So, closing shift barista, thank you for your grade-A coffee, your hospitable service, and for keeping the peace."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle, I am a very picky coffee drinker--this place exceeds even my standards. The interior is beautifully done and the music is always great. Both times I have gotten a soy latte and it was equally as delicious no matter who made it. The staff is inviting and friendly. A great place to hang out and get work done."}
{"text":"I tried out the burrito and my taste buds are definitely satisfied. I bought my son the açaí bowl and I almost feel like it was absolutely flawless the taste and presentation. To drink I got me a peach mango black tea. The staff was friendly and my food was out in great time. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Their Chai Latte is top notch! Very warm and welcoming environment. Shawn was extremely friendly and offered some great suggestions for local sites to visit, being a local himself. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee place in Phoenix. The parking was a little weird as it's sharing with the apartment complex, so check the signage before picking a spot. The inside had a really cool vibe and was a lot bigger than I expected. Service was super friendly and I was served by one of the owners, a top chap from Australia. I went with the donut espresso which caught my eye. It was two shots with condensed milk topped with a flavoured whipped cream and cinnamon. So good! They also had an apple and strawberry infused water and a super clean restroom. Definitely make it a coffee shop to check off your list."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough. The service is top notch. The food is fantastic. The coffee is out of this world good. The decor is modern and awesome. I spy a  coffee bean on the ceiling...so cool. I got a white mocha, which was delicious. Also, the acai bowl and the breakfast sandwich with the chutney that is probably boarding on the best addition to a sandwich you could ever have. There is nothing about this new coffee shop I don't like. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"First time here, great Ambience and friendly but slow  service. food is way too expensive I just had a small orange juice a small latte and scrambled eggs: 20$!! presentation of the food was horrible ate only half of it, coffee was great."}
{"text":"Have to say, for recently opening, things were pretty good. LOVE the openness of the shop and the overall vibe. My husband really enjoyed his cappuccino, and I had the most amazing sourdough toast topped with goat cheese, avocado, and tomato--- REALLY, so simple, but so good! My drip coffee was just okay, but for some reason tasted better towards the end of the cup. I wasn't very happy about paying $4 for very skinny croissants. My daughter's was actually under baked in the center. I let them know and they kindly informed me they were still figuring things out. Would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone staying at the Grand Sheraton as it is a very short walk."}
{"text":"This place is great. There's a good amount of space and seating options with outlets. The music choices were excellent. The barista just gave me an iPhone charger to use when my phone was low, I didn't even have to leave it with them. The coffee is great too. I'm usually a Cartel Coffeehouse kind of guy (I frequent both Tempe and Scottsdale locations) but their downtown location has no space. Fillmore is in a great location, is a great workspace, and even has some cool art from local artists. Can't recommend it  enough!"}
{"text":"I had a caramel latte which wasn't bad.   I'm not sure where they get their beans but it was very similar to Cartel.   Nice  clean modern place."}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of an açaí bowl connoisseur and if I find a spot with one on their menu I always order it. It's my litmus test for any coffee shop, restaurant, etc. and often determines if I'll be back. Fillmore Coffee's açaí bowl is EXCELLENT. It had great açaí and other berry flavor, wasn't too icy, and was piled high with toppings (strawberries, bananas, chia seeds, agave syrup, and granola) enough to last until the very last bite!   I also ordered an iced dirty chai with almond milk which was great, but I prefer mine a bit more spicy. The prominent flavor of this particular chai was cinnamon, so if that's what you like, then this chai is right for you.   Overall I loved the atmosphere and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a really great place to go for ASU students in between classes. They are always fast and the food/coffee is always good. On top of that, this place is adorable, and the WiFi is fast. (important!) Totally recommend for a quick breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"A bit over priced. I ordered a vanilla latte, I don't think there was any vanilla in it. The parking in the garage next door is very convenient for downtown!"}
{"text":"If your a coffee enthusiast you will want to get your cup of java here. The coffee is GREAT, and the atmosphere is perfect to get some work done or have a great casual conversation."}
{"text":"You've found your coffee shop...YOU'RE WELCOME! I honestly can't say enough about the coffee, protein shakes, food, vibe or staff at Fillmore. I work remotely and stumbled upon this place in downtown Phx when looking for a coffee and internet connection. It immediately became one of my favorite spots in town. The vibe elicits a homey, comfortable, welcoming atmosphere where there's enough noise so you feel like you're a social being; but not loud enough to force you outside to take a conference call. I'm 100% going back and suggest you all do too."}
{"text":"what a wonder from the God of Downtown Phoenix. Thank you for bestowing this gift of Fillmore Coffee.  awesome location if you are on ASU's downtown campus and don't want to stand in that horrendous Starbucks line for centuries only to be served tasteless coffee and covertly greasy food.  This place is the opposite of that experience. Extremely friendly service. Great burritos. Fantastic scones. Very very very comfy leather couches. Free water that has either cucumbers, strawberries, oranges, pineapples, or some combination of those things infusing in it.   This is a place for being happy and enjoying life. So, do those things. With me. Come to Fillmore."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee place.  I loved all the different seating places and the comfy relaxed vibe.  walking distance from our hotel and delicious latte's because anything is better than starbucks generic coffee"}
{"text":"Good hot coffee, very friendly staff, dog friendly, and they're open early enough for me to stop in before work. Also, the pastries look and smell AMAZING! Haven't had a chance to try them yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to it. We have a lot of coffee shops downtown but this one seems like it will be a winner."}
{"text":"The coffee here was absolutely delicious! I didn't know about the free parking in the garage, so I had to walk a bit to get there. (The metered spots right outside were the weird ones you have to download an app to pay for)."}
{"text":"I am cautious to try coffee places outside of my comfort zone because I am so very picky about my lattes and ratio of espresso to milk. Over-steamed milk is a plague to otherwise excellent espresso, and burnt espresso is even worse!  I've had several espresso drinks from here, and they have been consistently delightful. The espresso is flavorful; you can actually taste the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors like nuttiness and fruits and florals (depending on the espresso used that day).   I'm truly surprised at the consistency of the lattes I've ordered. Major chains are often consistently mediocre, but the baristas here go above and beyond.   The café itself is cozy and lovely, and the food offerings are fresh and relatively healthy. I admit that I haven't explored those options as much, but they are a refreshing change from the typical pastry and sugar-loaded choices you'll find at most cafés!   If you're in the area, skip Starbucks and walk a few blocks to this gem! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Coffee shop is really nice, coffee is amazing, and the people that work there are awesome. Only issue with this place is one of the owners, who I believe is a gentleman named Michael, needed help opening a jar. He was a bit puny so I didn't mind helping him... but seriously? Do crossfit or something so you can open your own jars bro."}
{"text":"The best local coffee shop in downtown Phoenix.Great People, Ashley, Austin are amazing All food is homemade, you will love it,enjoy the ambiance"}
{"text":"Fillmore is my favorite place to go eat and study. I've had the butternut squash chicken wrap, the delux veggie wrap (yum), breakfast borrito, cinnamon rolls, coffee, ice tea, and raspberry banana walnut muffin (which is my favorite ever)!! All of them are phenomenal and I've never had a bad experience. Very great happy workers. Always clean."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with amazing aesthetics and delicious coffee and food, you're in the right place. Perfect spot to study or just to hang out- strong wifi connection, awesome music playlist and friendly staff.   Acai bowl is way worth the price (although the price is pretty average if not actually cheap compared to other acai bowls I've had)."}
{"text":"GO HERE! Absolutely love this place. I consider myself a little bit of a espresso snob and I will tell you this is some of the best in Phoenix. Not acidic or overly sweet perfectly balanced with a full body flavor that is smooth and easy to drink without adding any sweetener. To top off the incredible espresso- The staff is the definition of the perfect coffee shop. The owners Mike and Tristan work almost every day and you can tell the staff ?Leah, Ashley, Sean, and the Austins love to work here and are genuinely good people. In addition to every reason you should be at this coffee shop, the freshly baked goods are amazing for a sweet treat after you have one of their lunch or breakfast items on the full menu."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop that just opened.  Great pastries, cookies and coffee.  Very friendly staff you have to stop in and try it."}
{"text":"Always looking for new coffee shops. Went early morning. We enjoyed the openness and lighting. Music was a bit loud to have an enjoyable conversation.  Had an Americano and Latte both good not bitter. The B&E breakfast sandwich was delicious and filling. Had the avocado toast which was also tasty.  Has wifi."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and the quality of the food was very good.  I got the breakfast burrito and it was served very hot and tasted great."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot but the quality of the coffee is not there. There are several other options around the block that have better coffee.  FWIW I ordered a cold brew."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and breakfast bites. I love their drip coffee. Very flavorful and does not taste like burnt coffee beans. My favorite thing to order is their Acai Bowl. They add bananas, coconut flakes, granola, you name it! It's delicious and my favorite way to start the morning! Great baristas!"}
{"text":"Holy egg sandwich! I so wish the Fillmore had been open when I lived at skyline. The decor is modern and the cafe is spacious. I came here to try their coffee and egg sandwich. They source their coffee from Street (according to the gal that works there) and the latte I had was tasty. The real star was the egg sandwich though...This thing rivals lux in deliciousness (doesn't surpass it, but is a good competitor). The sandwich has 2 eggs, which they made over easy on my request, cream cheese, regular cheese, chutney, and bacon on a giant tasty ciabatta roll. Hell to the yes! It was huge and cost around 8$. I'd definitely get it again. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.  It took fifteen minutes to get a from scratch breakfast burrito.  Not that 15 minutes is an eternity, but the place was nearly empty.  I think the one person making food items would be bogged down with 5 or more food requests.  Burrito was fresh and hot, tasted good but nothing to rave about.  So I'm rather surprised this place has a four plus rating.  Value?? All I'll say is that there is another \"breakfast place(club)\" not too far away that is well worth the extra walk next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delightfull breakfast at Filmore Coffee. Located north of Arizona Center. Had their Burro which was excellent. Scrabmbled eggs, bacon, goat cheese, tomato, jalapeno chutney and fresh spinich. The chutney added a very unique flavor... sweet with a little heat. Great music, WiFi, open seating areas and a great vibe. I like it!"}
{"text":"In the downtown Phoenix area around ASU, Fillmore Coffee is by far my favorite coffee shop. It might even be my favorite coffee shop that I have tried in Phoenix/Scottsdale for the following reasons:  1. The cold brew is great! It doesn't have the super acidic taste. It is smooth, full of coffee flavor, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste.   2. Breakfast options are good, and the cinnamon roll is awesome.  3. DOG FRIENDLY. I have a stressful job so it's so nice to just see a dog chilling in the morning with its person. It reminds me not to be so stressed either!   4. Baristas are friendly and there is a plenty of varied seating options, from your standard tables, to counter seating, to high tops."}
{"text":"Even if I didn't live two floors above this coffee shop, it would be my go-to. The coffee is very good. Strong and flavorful but not burned or bitter. The chocolate croissants are to die for and the Mediterranean Salad is tasty and one of the best deals in town. Toss in a modern, relaxed atmosphere and the best staff ever and you have a gem here in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"On a recent visit, used my trusty Yelp to find nearby coffee shops and this place was nearby (among others). I don't know why I was surprised to see it part of a larger building complex but it was still a cozy spot. Lots of areas to sit, whether alone, or with larger groups. LOVED the outlets with USB ports. Wish that was more prevalent in Philly.   Tried the vanilla caramel latte which was delicious.....went back the next day for it!  Cool spot for coffee and hanging out."}
{"text":"Nice downtown spot with parking (yay!!). I like the space, the coffee, and the snacks. All around a good place to read a book, meet a friend, or just sit and enjoy a delicious drink!"}
{"text":"Coffee= amazing. Food = delicious. Pet friendly. Great vibe. Just finished brunch with me and my friends and it was such a treat! Met the owners Mike and Tristan and they were very friendly and welcoming. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome cold brew, tea and really good food too!! Plus the atmosphere is good and the lighting is perfect for studying and doing work. 10/10, will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The espresso is a bit bitter, but still drinkable. My daughter got the grilled cheese and I had the sourdough toast with avocado, goat cheese and tomato. It was amazing. I will drive 10 miles out of my way for that wonderful goat cheese, avocado toast."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this week and absolutely loved it!  Coffee and tea were both superb (we had a pumpkin tea latte and the pumpkin black tea), service was friendly, and there's a large selection of food in case you get hungry.  I also really like the free water.  I know, it's goofy, but there was a large pot of water containing oranges and mint that was super refreshing.  Chairs were comfortable, with a big range of seating choices (we went for some upright high-tops, but there are some cozy couches in the back with a good-looking board game selection).  Even better, a lot of the people in the apartment complex upstairs seem to come by when they're headed out to walk their dogs, so you get to say hi to a lot of super cute puppers while you work.  5/5, will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I will miss it when I leave Phoenix (which is fortunately soon). This place is rarely crowded, but then again it's been over 110 degrees over the last few weeks. The layout and design is very excellent - modern and minimalist without being too bourgie or hipster. The service is good and the baristas have been pleasant.  I've tried the iced latte three times and it has consistently been excellent. The music volume is always at a decent level. The TV unfortunately has sports playing, but on the plus side the volume is off and it's in a corner of the place (I often hate the noise of sports even more than the sport itself). I've had the breakfast sandwich twice. It's good, but not consistent. Also it's a bit pricey at $8. I think $6 is more reasonable. A big plus is the lemon and orange infused complimentary ice water. Sometimes it's the small details that elevate a place from 4.0 or 4.5 stars to 5 stars!!  The WIFI here is excellent. I hate having to go to Starbucks for good WIFI, but sometimes I do that. But not since I've found this place."}
{"text":"Industrial but relaxing interior, with a contemporary red, white, black and blonde wood palette is the perfect setting for reasonably-priced coffee and food. I had the chicken wrap with the goat cheese and it was probably one of the best wraps I've ever had. I also had a hot Dirty Chai Latte. It was good too, but Cartel Coffee's still has the crown.  Only off thing about this place so far is the tall round tables along the wall to the left of the counter. They can spin 360 degrees very very easily and quickly as you use them, so I was a little uneasy having my stuff on it."}
{"text":"Tried the donut espresso today and it was awesome! Fillmore is all around the bees knees."}
{"text":"This is a REAL coffee shop where they have truly mastered the art of creating unbelievably incredible coffee."}
{"text":"With all of the coffee shops opening in downtown Phoenix lately, this one stands out! Great vibe when you enter, relaxed baristas, incredible coffee. The food menu is huge and my Italian Panini was outstanding! Great luck to this place, I think we have a winner!"}
