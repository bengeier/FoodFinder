{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when out for lunch with a friend. I had the salmon lovers bento box which was tasty and excellent value. I was absolutely stuffed. The salmon sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth fresh. It was so yummy I had to come back the next day. The staff is super friendly and warm. They put extra effort into making their customers feel valued."}
{"text":"Before Etsu, I occasionally came here for food, now that Etsu has arrived, I hardly eat here unless I have too. Alas, today I came here for take-out because Etsu was closed! =(

Fujiyama is an OK restaurant. It's pretty old looking inside and had a couple flies flying around when I was there today.. I got the lunch special to go which was bulgolgi and 6 pieces cali roll. When I got home, i noticed there were only 4 rolls... hmm..

It's not amazing but it's quite filling and definitely worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"This place used to be the 'it' sushi place for me about 5 years ago.   

Fujiyama still offers complimentary 1) edamame, 2) either two pieces maki sushi (battered and fried) or plain chap chae noodles, and 3) sliced oranges for dessert (Only at Dinner time).

But the meal experience is not the same as it used to be.  While I am slightly disappointed that the complimentary edamame has been reduced to nearly half its original portion, I lament the fact that Fujiyama no longer offers a slice of grilled mackerel fish.  My friend and i would just about die over this well-seasoned and perfectly grilled filet--it was so good!  Ironically, they still display the glowing Toronto Life article that speaks to this mackerel appetizer!  

In the few times I've been back, I've probably gone out of habit and nostalgia.  The food is still delicious but the size of the rolls are as slim as my thumbs and it makes me wonder if Fujiyama is having difficulty on their profit margins. 

It would be a shame if this place closed down.  I hope the owners rally, continue to uphold the same quality as they did before and not lose their reputation as they scrimp by.  

Their menu is too broad as they try to cater to way too many tastes.  They should reduce it to fewer options and just do those items REALLY REALLY WELL. 

Good luck, Fuji.  I'm rooting for ya!"}
{"text":"I've been to Fujiyama for both sit-in and take out, and both times the food has been just fantastic.   The tempura, sushi, teriyaki and noodles are just delicious.   The menu has many options and I definitely recommend the combination bento box.   

Also, so far the service was been wonderful each time I've been there."}
{"text":"For cheap sushi, you can't go wrong. That's all I can say :)

My friend and I ate here, had a good talk before she left and that's all it's really great for. I think ND Sushi Grill near Eglinton & Laird is much MUCH better (authentic Japanese food, try their $80 11-course omakase chef's choice menu!!) but for the price and location, this hits the spot."}
{"text":"Fujiyama used to be my favorite sushi on Baldwin but since then Etsu has taken over that spot. The sushi is cheap and I find it to be quite good. Put in complimentary edamame, a decent lunch specials menu, friendly service (have experienced it to be slow at times but not always) and I really like their private booth type seating. Just make sure not to lean back too hard though because those things are not super sturdy. 

Sushi is not of extremely high quality but it is worth the price you pay. Overall a 3.5 star average for me!"}
{"text":"I ended up eating here because everything else on Baldwin was closed! The place is dark and a bit weird with a window display which I can't seem to describe. The owners and workers are korean and friendly. The sashimi was extremely fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again when there are a few places all on the same block that seem to be better."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch and it is absolutely did not receive anything Sandra O. is talking about. Here's a summary of my visit:

Come in, get seated, then wait 20 minutes to get a hold of a server to ASK for a menu (weren't that busy, maybe 4 or 5 tables). Look at the menu, they're bento boxes don't really come with much (just salad, soup, rice your choice of bento and two \"side\" dishes which are basically puny little vegetables). So we decided to order the combination bento since there is more food (we hoped) as you get to choose 2 items (from types of teriyaki's to bulgogi, tempura, dumplings, etc). Okay it's $10 but seems like it should be a lot of food.

Get my dumpling and tempura bento... I get 4 PUNY gyoza's which were obviously just frozen and reheated. Everything tasted god awful (some of the worst tempura I've ever had and I love any sort of breaded anything). The beansprouts almost made me gag, and actually.. that was all that in the bento! It was considerably less food then you'd expect when ordering a bento and it wasn't that cheap either!!! 

My friends food were the same. One got a maki special and the salmon was turning an almost brown colour and they were of small size.

Service again was incredibly slow, took another 15 minutes to get some to take my credit card!! They passed by it at least 5 times!

ugh I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today - I use to come here quite often, because it's actually one of the better places for a sushi lunch on Baldwin Street.  Considering that it's downtown cheap sushi, I can't complain too much about the quality of it.

It's pretty cheap - about $11 (including HST and tip) for a combo - they have this \"bento combination box\" where you can choose two items (i.e. age tofu, sashimi, sushi, kalbi, bulgoki, dumplings, salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, tempura etc.). It's quite filling; not AMAZING, but for the price you're paying for - it's pretty good."}
