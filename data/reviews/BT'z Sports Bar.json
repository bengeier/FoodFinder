{"text":"Privately owned, great food, great employees, welcoming atmosphere, best pizza and Chicken Caesar salad I've ever had. Keep up the good work, Bruce"}
{"text":"Great local sports bar.  All the games were on. the Pizza was awesome.  And the service was top notch (Thanks Raquel!).  The owner even greeted us at the door the 2nd time we went there, and personally escorted us to the table of our choice."}
{"text":"At 7:45PM I ordered 3 burgers and the app sampler to be picked up at 8:15pm. When I got there to pick up or to go order I was told it would be a few minutes because the cheese was being melted onto the burgers. I ended up waiting a good 10 minutes and then when I got our order home every item in the app sampler was grossly undercooked. The breaking was just sliding off as soon as you picked any item up and there were pools of water making everything soggy. Yes, water not grease. I regret spending the $50 here and should have just taken my family through the drive through at Wendy's right next store."}
{"text":"this place is awesome I love the music usually rock and roll and you can change it on the juke box or on your phone using a credit card!! I usually come for the Taco night on Mondays and they are awesome the pizza is also really good and also made fresh but best of all are the about 15 beers on top which they got pretty much everything you could ask for"}
{"text":"A group of us went there to watch the game and the waitresses had all the tabs messed up.  The food was horrible.  The wings were under cooked.  Thry change cooks every week.  No wonder the food is so bad. Apparently it is a crappy place to work as well"}
{"text":"Place is somewhat friendly and food is okay, go for the wings. Don't have too much fun though"}
{"text":"We came back to try them out one more time, after swearing them off. Wished we never came. Our food was burnt and we almost never saw a waitress. We won't return again."}
{"text":"The Golden Spicy Wings and the Bases loaded Fries are our favorites. Debra and Bruce the owners are great!"}
{"text":"Tried to find a website to notify the owner but was unable to find a way to contact them, so posting here... My finance and I are regulars- I know the team there knows us well, we go once a week :) Normally I would say awesome, 5 stars. And since the new owners took over for the most part it has been great. Over the last 6 months there are few times there were cause for concern. Sometimes at night it seems to become a hangout for those who work there -- still, not usually a huge issue for us. But tonight, we went on our weekly visit. Sat on the patio at 6pm. by 6:03 put in our order as usually for wings and pizza. Took a while for the beers, and then by 7...no wings. No pizza. Once the waitress mentioned the kitchen being overwhelmed and she apologized. Yet 15-20 min later, we had to go inside to cancel the order and just get our check to leave. The place was not nearly busy. Unsure of what the issue was that held up our order. We told them to bring our check and cancel the order, we had to go. Rather than comp anything, we were given our tab and told they would check on our order. Unfortunately, had to tell him forget it-- after well over an hour of waiting, we had to go.   Hopeful that this will not be the norm. Normally there is consistent wait staff that knows our order, are efficient, and friendly. And beer/wings are delivered within minutes. Don't know what has happened tonight but sure hope it goes back to the way it was!"}
{"text":"The WORST.  First, we sat at a table outside, sat for a few minutes, finally a waiter comes out and delivers drinks to another table, using the \"F\" word several times amongst this group (guess he knew them) and politely walks away, completely ignoring us all together.  My husband has to chase him down to simply ask for menus.  He returns with menus, stops to swear with the other table again and stops back by to ask if we want drinks.  He finally returns, we order drinks, and for goodness sake, our meal, as we might not ever see him again, unless it's to observe the expletives shared with the other table.  The food was acceptable, but the experience in general ruined any form of positive feedback. There were families nearby, but the waiter and his foul mouthed friends didn't seem to care..  Won't be going back to this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been in a couple of times now. Great pizza, good beer selection. The only complaint is its too hot in the restaurant.  If it stays that uncomfortable we wont be back in summer."}
{"text":"Got corned beef and cabbage for take out yesterday.  It waa excellent.  Came back today, they still had for special,  better today than yesterday."}
{"text":"The location and the people were great.  Service was good and attentive.  We were lucky that the weather was cooperating, but the outside patio could be cleaned up a bit more.  Not all chairs had cushions and it was a little disorderly.  I was not a huge fan of the garlic bites (a little too doughie and not enough garlic), but my husband liked them.  The gastronomic pizza was very good and priced well.    We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Garlic Knots were great. Casual atmosphere, indoor and outdoor seating, has a nice vibe to it. Not a sports fan, if you are, plenty of screens to watch on ;)"}
{"text":"This place has excellent customer service with great tasting food. Garlic knots are to die for. The menu has a huge variety of options. Both the owner and the cook made sure we were satisfied. Aimee our server took really good care of us! Definitely will come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Did not get happy hour pricing. Didn't notice until after we paid and waitress was no where to be found. This place doesn't honor their deals."}
{"text":"The wings had a good flavor, sauce was overly sweet, the server kept asking questions while I was eating, the big one was the lame excuse about the guest login password - I would have stayed longer and spent more money if I had Internet access. Oh don't forget the smokers smoke from the patio. Won't come back"}
{"text":"I really want to give them a lower star, but I feel it should be higher. so here goes. After reading reviews about wing day and street taco day I decided to try it. Plus, they have jalapeno poppers for 5 bucks! So I went in for lunch and inquired about the specials. Yeah, wing special starts at 4. hmmm. Ok, decided on poppers and a slice of cheese pizza.  The poppers were jalapeno and cream cheese (which I despise!) but the menu didn't specify and I failed to ask. They also were soft, so I think they were baked. AWFUL!   The pizza was ok- not great, but satisfied my hunger. The server asked if he could box up the rest of my poppers (I only ate 3/6) and I said no, that I didn't like them and I don't like cream cheese- I prefer cheddar. He acted totally surprised, but of course charged me full price. Whatever- I'm sure their other food is good, but I was just so turned off by the poppers and the whole \"specials start at 4\" bit that I have no desire to go back. I will say the server was good- no complaints on him at all. Just a disappointing waste of 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place....the manager greeted us and was very pleasant.  However, anyplace that calls itself a bar should have a bartender that knows how to make an old fashion (I knew when it came that it wasn't right and it wasn't so I sent it back and ordered a tall rum & coke.  Well, guess they don't know what a \"tall\" is either....I just really struggle with places that don't know how to make a cocktail, but it's a \"sports bar\" so maybe my expectation was just too high.  The hamburger I had was really good though so they've got that going for them!"}
{"text":"Great low key pizza (and more) restaurant. Now serving weekend breakfast with a limited but tasty menu. I love the bloody's"}
{"text":"Brought the kids on a Saturday night for karaoke.  It starts supposedly at 8 but didn't actually begin until after 8:30 and then steadily began to fill up with people.  Service was excellent and friendly.  Kids had a great time doing karaoke.  Wasn't impressed with the food.  Tried: garlic knots meatballs white pizza dessert cookie  Glad they had O'douls!"}
{"text":"The great: excellent wings and Papago Orange Blossom on tap. The meh: buffalo chicken salad was kind of mediocre. The yuck: pizza was served to us with a giant pink puddle of ham juice on top and the pizza was raw in the middle - cheese not even melted. Sent it back and asked them to remake as the pink ham juice soaked through and soaked the bottom crust when they cut it. They returned the same pizza back to us, more browned on the top, but with a soggy and wet ham juice crust on the bottom. Gross.   Server was appropriately mortified and removed the pizza from the bill. Picked up some take & bake from Papa Murphy's on the way home since I was still hungry for pizza forty bucks + tip later."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! The staff is welcoming and friendly. The owner Bruce takes time to always say hi and see what's new. The music played is current and uplifting. The food is even better. Big portions and great taste! Come check this place out ;)"}
{"text":"Well it's the usual hit and miss once I think a place is on game then I get let down yes I've given this pub 4 stars and today I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and I'll be damned if there are NO mushrooms that are insight when I mentioned it to the bar tender he leans over my burger and say I think there there ........  he did offer to have the cook saute up some but I would think my burg might be cold by then..............hmmmmm  ........"}
{"text":"Horrible service, over an hour to get food.  Waitress was rude and bitchy, owner could care less.  Never go to this bar again!"}
{"text":"Great local bar!  Been here several times for happy hour.  They have a $5 pizza and drink specials.   The place is always hopping with people.  It has a patio which is nice when the weather is great.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow I have lived just a couple of miles from this place for years and I just found out about it. Great wings!  Great service!  The garlic bread knots were fresh and super tasty. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch this week and was pleasantly pleased with BT'z. Kay, the server and barmaid, was very helpful with great suggestions. The other people at bar seemed like regulars (good thing if they keep coming back) and the joint had a good vibe to it. The food was very tasty with large portions. I had stumbled upon BT'z when I was lost the week before and ran into the owner there. He was very helpful and fun to chat with. He gave me his wife's card because I was looking for a chiropractor's office. I told him I would be back to visit his place. I am glad I did and I will keep coming back when I am in town. Thank you for a good meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Why are there no reviews on this place?? It's awesome, my top 5 new favorite local place to visit now.   Great HH from 2-7 with nice drink and food specials. Good variety of items on the menu. So far, impressed with their wraps and pizza. I've seen the owner there every time, working and engaging with customers. That tells me a lot about customer service and willingness to succeed.   Nice outside patio with separate smoking area, open inside/outside bar with several taps and plenty of TV's. Situated in the Target mall across from Bed/Bath Beyond. Been open about a year now and seems to have plenty of consistent regulars, who apparently don't like to leave reviews.   Businesses thrive on good reviews and need customers to keep the doors open. Keeping it to ones self to avoid the crowds, only hurts the proprietor and soon you'll be looking for another watering hole.   Try it out, enjoy and leave an honest review for others to decide on. No disappointments here."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was very slow. They need to hire more help. Won't go back. Second hand smoke on the patio was obnoxious. One member of our party waited over an hour for a less than mediocre hamburger."}
{"text":"Bring back pizza fries! Disappointed they wont make them, after seeing a pic of them on Yelp"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place another shot. Came with the same co-worker as I did last time. We both agreed thumbs down. No reason to think about ever returning. I ordered the chili cheese dog. It was nasty. The chili tasted as if it was made from the base of the spaghetti sauce with beans added to it. When the waitress asked how everything was I told her the truth. I told her that it was absolutely the worst chili cheese dog I have ever come across. Ate 2 bites. I couldn't muster another bite even though I was very hungry. Needless to say I went back to work on an empty stomach. I do not recommend coming here to eat. Now drinking, that may be a different story."}
{"text":"Stopped in as I wanted some wings and pizza before the Superbowl. Ordered an XL pepperoni and sausage pizza a large order of mild wings, and Poppers to complete the food order. While waiting, I ordered a nice Stella Artois. The staff was friendly, prices are pretty good, and service was quick. However, the wings were really dark and really dry, even though they had a decent flavor and presented well. The pizza was not bad, but definitely average. There wasn't much flavor. The atmosphere was nice and the energy was positive. I could only eat about 4 wings before I had to stop from the dry meat. The wings were big, so that helped. They were just so overcooked. I didn't check them as this was a to go order. Luckily the food was free for my guests, but they still kept talking about the dry wings and bland pizza. A least I got cold beer while I waited! Not sure if I got a bad day for cooking as I have eaten here before without any issues. Not sure when I will return, especially for pizza and wings, but I Hope it was an off day for the cook."}
{"text":"I've seen this place on Yelp for a while and wanted to try it. Honestly I expected more. The food was mediocre and nothing special. I actually couldn't finish my pizza, didn't like it. Our waitress was friendly and very attentive though."}
{"text":"Sports bars a tough one to review.  My wife and I have lived in the area for almost a year and have been meaning to try BTz.  Well we finally did.  Please keep in mind that a 3 star from me for a sports bar is not a bad thing.  BTz is just like most sports bars in the area.  Its a nice place with decent food, fair pricing and staff that does their job. There just isn't anything special that would set them apart form others in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to eat good food and great service. Nice neighborhood sports bar."}
{"text":"I came across btz grill when they were transitioning from the former restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar caught my eye, so I thought I'd try it. I had the bacon and avocado burger. It was awesome! Great grilled taste, juicy, crisp bacon, tasted so good, I didn't need condiments. I've tried several different burgers, tacos and wings and have to say, I loved it all. As for the service, the servers keep my drinks coming, they're knowledgeable about the menu and give great recommendations if you want to try something different. Everyone is very friendly with genuine smiles making you feel at home. Tiana is my favorite server, always on top of things, great smile and a bubbly personality. I've recommended btz grill to several friends and they have nothing but good things to say about it.  Bring your friends to btz grill and see for yourselves."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here. You can't go wrong. Our server Tia was awesome. Super cool and attentive."}
{"text":"YELPERS....when you check in BT'z offers Free Garlic Knots.  Nice touch.  Came here for the 1/2 pound burger special they advertised for 9.00 and it was really good.  The check-in for Yelpers was a nice added bonus.  They have so many TV's which is great place to watch a game etc.  This establishment is really geared for locals the do have an open patio but it over looks a parking lot and a Bed Bath & Beyond so the ambiance is not that great. Please note the place is clean and big with plenty of tables, so I will try this place one more time for the wings.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Service was good...downhill from there. Lukewarm beer, horrible music, and food was awful. So disappointing. We have been here before many times and tonight was terrible. No excuse for warm beer in a bar and usually the music is a mix of 80s and 90s. Whatever was playing tonight was not good. The food was unacceptable especially for the price. Seasoning on the meat and a toasted(at least warm) hamburger bun goes a long way. Only reason for three stars was the server"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, but the food was very overpriced for what you get and the quality. The wings were pretty good, but the pizza was awful. Sauce had a stewed tomato taste and there was way too much cheese; was actually gummy. Again, our waitress was great and the wings were good, but the pizza was not that good at all and overpriced."}
{"text":"This is just the best little neighborhood bar!  Friendly people, knowledgable staff, owner who wants to know your name, and lots of great service.   Love the outside bar seating, especially for their new Sat. and Sun. Breakfast and a perfect Bloody Mary.  Food still great, love the salads and pizza.  They make their own crust and its nice and thin.  We've worked our way thru the menu and its our go to spot for pizza.   The Saturday night open mic is awesome.  Nice place to spend a lazy evening.  Bruce and Deborah have a great place here. Happy we found it."}
{"text":"Unless u r elderly don't bother. Employee see to care mostly about elderly that r reg. The cook sucks I ordered burger med rare and got well done.  Order beer for special hour on list and was told only domestic but nowhere on the menu for special hour did I say not this one. Like I said waitress didn't care about us as we weren't elderly."}
{"text":"Our server was attentive. It was not busy and we ordered a pizza which took forever to come and when it did arrive they brought it in a box. Then took it back and placed it on a tray. Anyway it was cold and not done. We ate two pieces and left the rest. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place truly is a hidden gem. 50 Cent wings on Monday, 1.50 street tacos on Tuesday, half-price pizzas on Wednesday!  HH 2-7pm w/2.50 domestic pints.   We went on a Monday (sat outside) and had the wings. They were extremely good and we are definitely picky about our wings! They were large in size perfectly crispy on the outside and the sauce was delicious. We tried honey hot and hot and will definitely be back for more!   The menu has lots to choose from. I wish the patio was a bit larger however, I do like there is a smoking and non-smoking area outside.   If you haven't been... You definitely should! The food is great, the service was great and the obvious locals were very nice too!"}
{"text":"Love this bar been going sense its been open. The food is great I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Second time visiting.  Came for karaoke both times and teen friendly singers.   Karaoke by RobCo is great!   Plenty of tables for our party of 6.  Food is good overall -  loaded fries didn't get finished as they were just a touch undercooked but serviceable.   White pizza was great.  Meatballs were ok....bland, but that may be the Italian side of me being picky.   Cookie dessert x 2 was a big hit and cleared in 2 minutes flat  I think.   Didn't try the free garlic knots with check in on Yelp but teens gave a thumbs up :)  Drinks were good and reasonably priced.   Server was good but only one on the floor, seemed a bit too busy for just one.   Will come back for karaoke but without, not sure I would make the trip otherwise.  Update - karaoke is great.   Food not so much - burgers bland and overcooked,  garlic fries swimming in oil,  garlic knots slightly burned.   Won't eat here again.... just not worth the money."}
{"text":"Great food, went there for my second time and was really impressed. I was impressed with how clean the restaurant was, and how professional the wait staff was. They were prompt, kind and enjoyable to talk to. Great prices for the happy hour, overall I would recommend this place and I will go back in the future"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area.  Went in on Monday night 6:30pm.  Place was pretty busy was told it was open seating so we grabbed a table inside.  Waitress sees us sit down and tells us she'll be right over.  10-15min later and still no one approaches the table.  We got up and left.  Really wanted to give this place a try, however if their service is this poor and inattentive, I will spend my money elsewhere, and we did."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I like generally quiet places to eat. We stopped by this place mid-afternoon after running a few errands.  I ordered the pizza based on a cheap lunch special and it was surprisingly good.  The woman enjoyed her house salad and shared my sentiments on the pizza. The bartender acted as a secondary waitress and was courteous.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some salads and a pizza. Told it would take 20 mins. 40 mins later we finally got the pizza. Ordered two small Ceasar salads for $6 each which came in a 4\"x4\" styrofoam box, with a teeny tiny amount of salad in it, way too small for the money to satisfy an adult with an appetite. And the pizza? Meh, burnt a hit...probably better to order delivery from Domino's. Total bill was $30 and  when I paid (when ordering) gave a $6 tip to it was an expensive lesson. Great atmosphere, though.  Come here to drink at the bar and listen to karaoke and you may be more satisfied than us."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and have to say service is slow both times. Major of customers both times where at bar. There is no smiley faces on staff. The patio smells like stale beer.  They need to power wash it. The food was ok but couldn't get over smell of patio."}
{"text":"Ordered a hamburger and was brought a cheeseburger. Asked them to please bring me a hamburger. About two minutes later they bring me the burger. All they did was scrap the cheese off and flip the burger upside down! Thank goodness I'm not allergic to cheese I just preferred not to have it. Seriously was it  that much of an effort to make a new hamburger. How bad is the bar doing financially you can't make one burger over?Seriously disappointed. Will not be returning. How lazy can you get?"}
{"text":"When you find a place where there is diversity in the clientele and staff that caters to your wants and always greets you, you've found the right place. This is both a wonderful  place for the family and as a getaway for an hour or two at the bar. I cannot say enough positive things about the owners, Bruce and Deborah. There are many local bars and restaurants,  but my brother, my husband and I choose BT'z. Do not pass up a chance to hit this place up."}
{"text":"Bruce is awesome! He has both my favorites, Sonoran White Chocolate Ale and Angry Orchard Cider in the bottle. Thank you. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Disappointed for several reasons. One time I paid for my tab, over mind you, and bartender ran after me saying I didn't pay full amount. Seriously? I paid $7 over! It's not my fault she can't count 10's. Kitchen closes at 8:30 exactly, can't order anything after. Patties for burgers are smaller than buns. I could go on..."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a while but I will not return. I was in there around 5pm with a friend. After having only two beers we both stepped onto the patio. Once we returned we were told we were being cutoff and I was asked to pay my bill and leave for no apparent reason. We were both extremely baffled. I am a great tipper and spend alot when I go out. Will not return"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband, we smelled something delicious in the parking lot so we decided to try this place. I got the bacon avocado burger and fries, the burger wasn't great and the fries were cooked a little too long and there was guac on the burger not avocado slices. The burger was $15 for that price I would have thought it would have been awesome and it was a huge let down. My husband got a \"16 pizza half Bronx bomber and half cheese. It was $30 for the pizza which was ridiculous and they charged us the full price for the specialty pizza when we only got it on half. I will never come here again for the price and quality of the food it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned, family friendly  sports bar in North East Mesa! They have awesome daily food specials and a really nice indoor /outdoor dining area. Good place to view sporting events,  with plenty of TV's, and a great spot for locals to meet!"}
{"text":"Pizza was meh wings were ok fans running no ac should went digiorno pizza"}
{"text":"I loved the people and the location. I am not happy with the city issues on pets in the patio. Coming from Scottsdale they need to upgrade. The owners seem nice and willing to be cool about opening up more options. WE NEED MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY PLACES on the East Valley. I'm sick of driving 20 minutes for a place to go."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I like to punish myself. I decided last Saturday night for dinner I would go get a couple brews and some chow at a local bar. Ive eaten at most locations near me and its been a long time since I tried bts. I figured maybe they got better on the food and was willing to give it another shot. The bar feeling itself is getting better in this place, there was many friendly people except for a group of like 6 guys that stared me down as I walked in (who I know are regulars because ive stopped in for a beer from time to time) but they didn't worry me too much. I sat at the bar and the bartender was HUSTLING!! She was killing it. it took me less then 30 seconds to get a beer I wasn't too shocked since she has served me beer before and is always on point. So onto the food part. I ordered a fire burger (medium) with onion rings. When my burger came out I took a bite and my burger patty started to fall apart... Seriously, I asked for medium not burnt to hell. Another observation I had was the sauce and or the burger was just destroyed with salt! All I could taste was salt... the Onion rings were amazing, so i'm glad its hard to mess those up. Overall I gave this place 3 stars. The 2 stars are for their silver lining, a amazing bartender, cold beer and awesome onion rings... Ill return for a beer, but I wont order food till I find out that they either trained the cook or replace him."}
{"text":"This is only my 2nd yelp review ever. Sorry to say this one was not good. The server was busting her butt (Hence the additional star), however the place seemed understaffed to be able to keep up. This caused long wait times between drinks (Wife never got her 2nd one ordered), and food took about 20-25 min.   Once the food arrived, my wife's burger had rotten avocado on it. So much that they looked more like mushrooms. Not to mention the random back olive that was imbedded into the cheese of her burger. Now I LOVE salty snacks, but the fries we over seasoned even for me. Not worth the ~$14 for a burger. Especially when the toppings are rotten.  The owner eventually did stop buy and made a great effort to express his apologies and to make it right, but unfortunately it was too late. Our minds were made up at that point. He came across as being very genuine (And I believe he was), but from what I saw I don't believe that just an improvement to the food presentation would justify the pricing."}
