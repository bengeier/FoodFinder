{"text":"I was just so pleased and satisfied with my meal I had to write about it! Initially I meant to get one of this restaurants famous crepes, however after learning they served breakfast until 2pm and spying their new breakfast menu, I found I simply could not resist their house omelette with prosciutto & Brie!! Two of my favorite special foods in one perfect omelette.  I arrived at what must be one of their busiest times, and after some initial confusion as to who was lining up for take out and who was lining up to be seated I joined the correct line and waited only about 4-5 mins before a very pleasant hostess greeted me.  I was on my own and was seated immediately at a lovely, comfortable corner booth/table. Guessing they would be too busy to make it to me quickly I put my coffee order in with her. By the time I returned from the bathroom (v well kept!) a server was bringing my coffee order.  I had had a chance to review the menu while waiting and put my order in immediately.  The male server was friendly and efficient and I was left to my own devices to wait for my food. I watched the staff moving back and forth in this small establishment with ease and dexterity realizing they had a well oiled machine! I looked around and appreciated the simple decor was very clean & well maintained.  My server came over with more coffee apologizing for the delay (a party of 6 had been seated just before me, but after he returned to my table with more cream another server brought my dish out! (Also apologizing) I should note that I did not feel like I had been waiting long at all.  It was beautifully plated with a very fresh spinach and mixed greens salad and the gorgeous, thick balsamic dressing in a tiny metal dispenser on the side. My choice of toast was also served up, perfectly toasted and buttered just slightly so as to also enjoy a side of jam.  My meal was excellent and very well priced at $11.50, and, as only a good meal can I left with a big smile on my face despite the rainy day I walked out to."}
{"text":"This place has the best crepes in Toronto hands down. The sugar crepes are to die for!  The last 2-3 times I've been (during the summer) I ended up leaving because the wait was at least 30 mins long or the hostess forgot to seat us without apology. The third time this happened we explained to the Manger that this was not the first time this happened and she gave us a dry \"sorry\" like she could care less. We kindly walked out and never went back. The crepes are awesome yes but service is just as important as food. Without good service u have nothing."}
{"text":"had the Nutella crepe and it was SOOO good!!! tried friend's cinnamon one, meh, not for me. but there're bunch of other types i want to try! Will definitely go again, if not soon."}
{"text":"Maybe the \"Kid Friendly\" should be updated to say NO. FYI I used to love this place, I would go here all the time when I was at university. I grew up...and I had a baby. Now I came back with the stroller on a not so busy Saturday afternoon, only to come in and be told that strollers were not allowed...and it wasn't like I had some gigantic stroller either. There were a few empty tables.  Would you have turned away someone in a wheel chair? I don't think so. Absurd. I was so insulted. Way to stick it to your loyal customers. Never going back, and if you have small children I advise you not to go there either."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Had a craving for the eggplant panini.  But when it arrived it was more find Waldo than a premium panini. From what I remember it used to have a big eggplant piece but now it is shredded.  I don't mind it being shredded or whole but for goodness sake at the price it costs it should have more eggplant. It shouldn't be just a few white strips.   When I spoke to the host I was told a cold \"this is how our sandwich is\" disappointing..  Our server was much friendlier and got us a $4.25 discount ... Fortunately she is much better at customer service...   I will probably try again"}
{"text":"Easily the worst crepes and crepe ensembles I have had.  The service was sloppy. They have a location that attracts crowds and keeps their place fairly full. But the food is less than average.   I do not recommend this place even for 1st visit out of curiosity."}
{"text":"Best crepes ever. Good service, speedy wait time, amazing crepes.  Been here a million times and have never had a complaint. Ever.  My faves: Savory - Annie's Chicken Melt (Chicken, melted cheese, tomato, mushroom, and some special sauce) Sweet - Banana+Nutella with Wipped Cream  Price range- $6-$12 average"}
{"text":"It was first time so we don't know how it works. Whenever we pass by, they're always packed. So we thought maybe we need to order first then go sit ourselves but yeah we were wrong. I love crepes!! & whenever i dine in at desserts restaurants, i encourage everyone to order different foods so we can try them all lol. So yeah my friend had the nutella+banana+strawberry while the other one had the dark choco instead of nutella. Both of their orders are goood! Then mine was just a simple apple sauce with cinnamon. I asked the server if putting nutella would be a good idea. But i love nutella. So what we did, i bought a bowl of strawberries then had the nutella dip on side.  everythingg was awesome! Thumbs up for this cafeee!!"}
{"text":"Fairly speaking, this place does good job on its crepes. The small restaurant provides several combination of basic fruits for your sweet crepes such as chocolate (dark chocolate or Nutella), banana, and strawberry. They also make crepes with chess, ham, etc. I ordered a strawberry crepe with sugar. The strawberris tastes good than my expectation, but the crepe is too soft. I personally like brown crepes so as you can smell more aroma from pan cooking. In addition, as desserts, the price might be high for the people with limited budget."}
{"text":"Typical crepe place you get typical crepes. Nothing fancy. I like their Italian soda."}
{"text":"First review in Canada! Hear this was a good dessert place so I decided to come here with my family. I got a Nuetalla Latte and a Nuetella Crepe (as you can see I really like Nuetella). The dessert was good and so were the drinks. Service was good as well. My main concern is that is for every little modification in your dessert, they charge extra. For instance, someone in my party wanted to have milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate. We didn't mind paying the fee, but I believe that they should've told us before. I recommend this dessert place to you. enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Hi,  I went to this restaurant with my friends to try some crepes. I ordered a nutella one, all of us ordered dessert crepes, with ice cream. The waitress was incredibly kind, and funny at times. The staff was overall friendly! My crepe was good! I really liked it, since I am a fan of nutella. I would recommend this restaurant to a lot of people especially if they love dessert."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cafe Crepe several times throughout the years and honestly they are as good as it gets. The prices are reasonable and the portions leave you absolutely stuffed. They also have a large selection of crepes, which is great for vegetarians or picky eaters. I recently had one of their egg, chicken, mayo crepes which was super filling and had the right blend of ingredients.   I also love their lattes! I had a Nutella Latte the other week, which was enjoyable and had the right amount of foam. The service is courteous, but definitely not memorable. Cafe Crepe is a gem in my books for always providing reliable and savoury crepes!"}
{"text":"After going to this place several more times, I have nothing but good things to say!   I'm updating my review because I wanted to mention the savory crepes as well. They're amazing! My recommendation: \"Luke's big filler.\"   One caveat: if you're going on a weekend evening, be prepared to wait for a bit. But the crepes are totally worth the wait!  :-)"}
{"text":"I had a CrÃªpes which was not on card. It was a strawberry hazelnut syrup little something which melted on my tongue! It was a recommendation from the chef and he has not let me down!! I cant tell something about the other dishes but if you want something more unique, just ask the chef :) I was completely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I had the crepe with Nutella, strawberry and bananas. I love strawberries and bananas together, and it was fun to watch them make the crepes in the front window. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I like to \"brush up on my French\". What better way to do so than rejoicing over some delicious, fresh crepes at Cafe Crepe! Tucked away at the corner of John & Queen, Cafe Crepe is a simple little French restaurant that combines a few modern design elements with retro-chic tiles, lighting and art-as would a Parisian bistro. The atmosphere is intimate for a date, but relaxed enough for a night out with friends.  Cafe Crepe specializes in fresh-to-order sweet and savoury crepes. While the restaurant is known for its Nutella crepes (I couldn't even count the number of Nutella jars on display), I was pleasantly surprised to discover the savoury crepes were as tasty as the sweet ones.  Offering traditional French combinations of ham and cheese, chicken and mayo, or spinach and feta, the savoury crepes leave you satisfied and full-but with just enough room to squeeze in a few bites of dessert.  Over on the sweet side, they offer a selection of fillings-like fruits or chocolate-that you can put in your crepe. They are reasonably priced, between $6-10 a plate, however additional toppings can be pricey at up to $2.50 each (the most expensive being Nutella).  For the less adventurous, Cafe Crepe also offers a typical assortment of cafe food such as baguette sandwiches, house salads and a wide selection of coffees, teas and juices.  The restaurant is also licensed, for those who want something stronger than a coffee. Beers are available by the bottle or on tap, at about $5 a pint. Wine is available by the glass or bottle (varying prices); and liquor is available as a shot, cocktail or martini, anywhere between $4-8. Plus, they'll even spike your crepe with Rum or Grand Marnier if you ask for the Exotique or Special de Cafe Crepe, respectively.  If you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, Cafe Crepe is definitely worth a visit. To find it, look for the neon Eiffel Tower just steps away from the CN Tower. It's easily accessible by foot, transit (501 Queen), or by car, though the car will set you back the cost of parking (and finding a spot on busy Queen West!).  Price: Average $20-25 for two"}
{"text":"Very good crepe and drink with reasonable price. The main ingredient of the crepe is Nutella which is my favourite. The place is really nice and located in a convenience location. The staff are friendly and food is served pretty quick. Nothing to complain so far."}
{"text":"Food was fair, but service was ... Nah... Had this odd waitress who repeated my order wrong, I corrected her on the spot she gave me this annoyed \"I got this\" tone but still brought on the wrong order. Sounded annoyed when my friend had questions on the menu. In the end, held on to the checkbook with my credit card sticking out asking if I wanted change. Just bazaar."}
{"text":"I want to hate Cafe Crepe (\"Cafe Crap\" as two young wags put it as I was passing by recently). It's a chain. They pre-make their crepes by the stack. It's noisy and uncomfortable. Service can be slow. The salad mix can be gross (restaurateurs, is it so hard to roll your own??!).  But... if you're walking by after a long hard day of shopping, order something simple like a ham and cheese crepe and some good Illy espresso, and eat it at the one of the stools in the front room, it can be just the thing."}
{"text":"I've been here with a friend to split two crepes, a 12\" hotdog, and a chocolate shake. The many options for crepe fillings and non-alcoholic drinks were overwhelming. We ordered the smoked beef and dijon crepe as well as the strawberry and nutella one. The first crepe was amazing and, paired with the savoury hotdog, was very filling. The shake was decadent. By the time we got our dessert crepe I was almost too full to finish it. Of course, it was also amazing since no one can truly mess up nutella anything. However, our waitress was really busy and almost forgot our dessert crepe but she was apologetic. Other times that I have been here, I have ordered the prosciutto panini sandwich to go, which is comprised of prosciutto, bocconcini, and tomato in a very slim baguette. The first time I had it, it was so delicious that I had to order it the next time I went. However, the second time they forgot to toast it which was a real let down since it made the bread harder to eat. Paired with the very long wait to receive the order (which was annoying since I was on my lunch break and had to eat it at work instead), I will make sure next time to account for ordering and toasting time."}
{"text":"Delicious crÃªpes even when you get them on the go - the ham, cheese and egg is a hearty and filling enough meal for lunch, and the nutella crÃªpes are always delicious. Steer clear of the rum and sugar crÃªpe as it isn't very flavourful.  I wouldn't recommend this place to eat in as there's always a feeling of being rushed, but takeout is great in a pinch..."}
{"text":"Nice place for the first date. Crazy variety of crÃªpes! My fav is dark chocolate + vanilla ice cream. Hot chocolate is really tasty too."}
{"text":"While on holiday, my friend and I both came for crepes every night of our trip! Granted, we were visiting Toronto for only 3 days/2 nights but they kept us coming back for our late night gourmet munchies.  I was in awe of all the giant jars of Nutella they had on shelves, so if that doesn't reel you in then the crepe chefs in the front window might because they also have a \"drive through\" window so folks can order crepes from the sidewalk.  First time, my friend and I really lucked out and got our orders in on time before the kitchen closed. Though we ordered our crepes to go, we ate them on the spot and then left, they were so tasty.  I keep it simple when ordering sweet crepes, so I had the Nutella with strawberries one night, and then the strawberries with whipped cream the next and treated myself with a Nutella hot chocolate. The whipped cream is made fresh with just the right amount of sweetness.   Service was excellent and completely judgement free! I didn't order a savory crepe, but they had an expansive menu and it all sounded delicious. If you decide to treat yo'self while you're in downtown Toronto, whether in the morning, day or night, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Only my second time at Cafe Crepe.  Having just visited Paris, the crepes and baguettes were a bit short-delivered.  The crowd was great and the brunch was affordable, but the presentation lacked and the coffee (I was dying for coffee) was slow.  I tried their soup, it was delicious, but not as hot as I would have preferred.  I felt I had to eat it quickly before it cooled down too much.  I know we can't compare it to Paris, but ahhhh, wouldn't it be nice?"}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to visit this place after we done our shopping, and we were craving for sweet crepe. This is our second time dining at this place. I ordered the nutella and banana crepe, and a peach soda. I definitely love the combination of nutella and banana, I was so delighted to see the crepe was spread with generous amount of nutella! I also enjoyed the Italian peach soda, it has the right amount of sweet, and it wasn't as carbonated as the other  sodas which is perfect for my liking. I appreciate the friendly service as well, it's a good place for dates and hanging out/catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times already but usually take-out. Crepes are so good whereas services really depends..... on servers' moods"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place and it was good..and smelt great however it was expensive with everything charged separating..the crepes.. then the fruit... ice cream even a little whipped cream on top of the crepe.. i do not appreciate when places do this and people aren't stupid and know things add up.. my crepe i ordered was lemon and sugar then added fruit for extra..but stopped at the ice cream and whip cream cause it would be the cost of a meal then at pickle barrel or something! so i found this crepe slightly plain and would have appreciated even a scope or dab of whipped cream on it when you already paying for the crepe, fruit and tip etc.!!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe is a great go-to crepe place! I love how they have a good assortment and it isn't too pricey. If i go with my bf, i get the jam crepe (b/c sadly he's allergic to nutes =( ) and when i'm with friends i get anything with nutella in it! hahha  another random thing they have on the menu is their \"parisan hot dog\" it's really yummy  their savoury crepes are also delicious, it makes it so hard to choose so i usually get one savoury and one sweet!  service has it's ups and downs, but i don't really mind. i allows me to take the time to relax and chat. OH and my bf and i went on valentines day and they gave us chocolate dipped strawberries! it was a nice surprise =)"}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices for average at best product.  $11 for a crepe with some Nutella, banana, strawberries and coconut?!?  Highway robbery.  I have eaten crepes in Paris for half the price and twice the quality."}
{"text":"What's up with this place using precooked crepes that are not even hot?? Literally, the so-called chef just take out one of those premade crepes, put in some filling, and serve. No wonder it takes minimal time for them to serve a big party.   Crepes are supposed to be crispy on the outer layer, with juicy fillings, for example, hot melted chocolate. Here? Because crepes are not made fresh, the neutella does not even melt. It is literally just: big fluffy dough + neutella from a jar directly.   Omg I still cannot believe I paid 6 for that crap. Regretting lots. Not coming back again that's for sure:("}
{"text":"We've been there several times in the last few months, and each time our experience has been positive.  Yes, there's sometimes a wait, but that's because the place is often busy, especially on weekends.  But even then the wait isn't any more than 10-15 mins or so.  And once seated, things just get better.  Like the ham and cheese crepe - mmmmm, cheese.  A very filling meal.  My wife, the vegetarian, always gets the spinach feta crepe which is  consistently great. She also enjoys their Illy coffee."}
{"text":"I love crepes and I just so happened to walk past the chefs window making them. You can get them to go or have a seat inside. It's damn good with a lot of customization and fun creations they have made."}
{"text":"The dark chocolate crepe was delicious. The service was a little slow but must be expected for a Saturday.   Try to get a filling of the jams. Worth it."}
{"text":"YUMMY, love their nutella and banana crepe with chocolate ice cream it is too die for!!!!  Their coffee is good, but their cups are way too small."}
{"text":"Decent place for crepes. But its not that great and justified for the price. I also really not fond of how they offer whipped cream in a cup on the side."}
{"text":"I went here twice, and I always liked this restaurant. They have a great selection of breakfast, and lunch items. I usually just buy a sweet crepe such as a Nutella one. The pricing is decent, could be better. However, the staff is extremely friendly and kind. They were never rude to me, so that's why I like this place. I always go to this place for a crepe."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend to try their food. We came on a Tuesday for lunch and it wasn't busy at all and we didn't have to wait to be seated. I was really excited to eat because of the good aroma of the restaurant. Our server however wasn't the best. I forgot her name but she seemed like she hated her job. She then took our order which were tuna crepe and chicken crepe both with egg and mayo.   30 minutes later and we still didn't have our order. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE. So my boyfriend and I were already pissed because the table beside us got their food first and they came 15 minutes after us AND THEY ORDERED MORE FOOD!!! So I followed up our order at the front because it's getting busier and our server is no where to be found.   40 minutes and FINALLY our food came...My crepe was so stuffed with tuna that I had to remove most of it because it was waaaayyyyy too salty and my boyfriend's chicken crepe almost had nothing inside which pissed him off.   My boyfriend told me to order our dessert while we were in the middle of our crepes so when we finished, dessert will be ready. I tried calling our server but she just passed us every time. This PISSED ME OFF EVEN MORE. I was about to make a scene because no body likes bad service. We ended up not ordering dessert.   So I came to the front to pay since I saw our server at the cashier, I asked \"Can I pay here?\" She replied, \"No, I'll bring you the bill.\" So I calmly came back to my seat and she followed. She took our plates in a very loud way like she was angry or something. I inserted my debit card in the machine and I did it so fast so we could leave AND I GAVE NO TIP. I didn't want to see her again so I grabbed my boyfriend to leave before she comes back.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"I went with a friend. I got 2 crepes: the spinich with feta and the dark chocolate strawberry. Cafe crepe does not disappoint (except for the ham and cheese crepe which I had tried in a past visit. Ew. Do not - I repeat do not, order the ham and cheese)."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND THE CALORIES AND DO NOT EVER EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!! Where do I even begin...From the moment you walk in you are greeted by the rudest, most unprofessional staff.  I love crepes and have eaten them all over the city and around the world and the fact that these people claim to be serving crepes is a joke. They were the most disgusting crepes I have ever had in my life.  You need a steak knife to cut through their rubbery exterior.  I read some of the negative reviews before going and most of the complaints were centered on price, but to be honest, for great crepes, I don't mind spending a lot, but the prices here are beyond exorbitant!!!! We ordered 2 crepes and a tea and coffee and our bill came to almost $40 including tax and tip!!! I would have had no problem with the price had the crepes bared any semblance to a crepe, they were gross!!! If you decide to try this place, be forewarned that any topping is an extra $2+ charge for a pathetically cheap amount and it adds up quickly !! Don't bother ordering the ice cream either unless you enjoy eating chemicals.  These people even have the nerve to charge for whipped cream!!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday night on Civic Holiday for dinner. The place was full but we managed to get a table in a few minutes. We got the menu and was reading thru it. All this time, no server has come to take the beverage order and we just waited. After another 5 mins, we told a lady we are ready to place order and she said she will get our server. We waited for another 5 mins, we only see one server running around tables and a few sitting at the front entrance. We waved and tried all we can to get someone's attention without success. We waited for another 5 mins then decided to walk out.  Disappointed with the service. I was looking forward to try out this place too.... :("}
{"text":"I pass by Cafe Crepe all the time. Every time I do, I sniff the delicious scents wafting from the windows and make a note that to eat there someday. Today, \"someday\" finally arrived.  I am a HUGE crepe fan. I've been making them from scratch for years, (including recently for my Mom at Mother's Day brunch) so I have pretty high expectations. I much prefer dessert crepes to the savoury kind so I ordered the dark chocolate with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. The crepe was well cooked and well filled with chocolate and fruit. With the whipped cream the crepe was the perfect sweetness. It's not the best crepe I've ever eaten, but was quite satisfactory.  My friend and I also took advantage of the Wednesday beer special offering pitcher's for $11.50 (we had Keith's), which was not a bad deal.  Our server was polite, friendly and prompt and the venue was comfortable. Overall, good food, good experience."}
{"text":"Worst crepe ever. Went there on Thursday night to drown our sorrows after a disappointing Rudsak sample sale (decent jackets for women but nothing for men and not worth the price).  Waited about 30 mins for 3 crepes. Service was fine and drinks are cheap (only bonus). Crepes were dry, seemed over cooked and rubbery. I don't understand how 1- crepes can take that long...it wasn't very busy but maybe that's why they took long, because they were overcooked! and 2- how do you mess up a crepe? There's only 4 ingredients eggs flour sugar and milk/water. Anyway I don't recommend this place to anyone unless you want cheap drinks.   Menu has about 1000 items on it...bad sign to begin with.   Good concept, bad execution."}
{"text":"The ingredients inside my chicken Baja crepe were delicious, of good quality and complimented each other very well. Unfortunately, the crepe itself was way overdone. Crepes shouldn't be crunchy.  Service was very slow and prices a bit steep - crepe and juice came to $16 before tax.  Would probably return, but it wouldn't be top of my list."}
{"text":"I ordered the simplest sugar&butter sweet crepe. It was far more than what I expected. I tried crepes a gogo before, they can't compare with this.  The crepe is thicker and tasty.  The sweet level is perfect."}
{"text":"Ambiance is cool, but the crepes are hit-and-miss. I've had crunchy crepes here as well as delicious soft fresh ones. Their menu could use a revamp."}
{"text":"This is the place for a dessert after lunch or movies.. I love the strawberries banana nuttela crepe .. also you can make delicious combinations"}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good! Great location, very cozy, fantastic service and the price is affordable. You love crepes & brunch definitely a place to visit"}
{"text":"This cafe is by far one of my favourite places to go! I have been coming here for a few years and each time the food is up to par!   The overall ambiance is wonderful and the food is delicious too! I especially love how they offer a good variety of not only crepes, but drinks, salads, etc. My only issue is that sometimes the service is a little slow, however, most of the staff is extremely friendly and understanding!   I would totally recommend going here!"}
{"text":"My fav crepe place! Always pay them a visit when I'm in the area.  Friendly waiters. Only wish it was bigger."}
{"text":"Great time and breakfast with my wife. Reasonable and everything crÃªpes. A little crowded due to an odd seating arrangement but worth the wait. Will continue coming here when in town. Best place for anytime of day!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed a dark chocolate & banana crepe the other night to satisfy a pregnancy craving.   Took it for take-out, so I can't comment on the cleanliness or atmosphere of the restaurant part.  The crepe was tasty though!  Staff were friendly, and offered to help me with suggestions.    The only thing is, I was paying while they made my crepe, and when I was done paying, it was already ready - it makes me think that the actual crepe was not made fresh.   I saw that there was a stack of already-made crepes nearby, so I suspect it came off that pile.   If it had been made fresh, that alone would have gained this place another star."}
{"text":"After eating sushi next door, our group of friends decided to have some dessert at Cafe Crepe. Because their doors and windows were open, the aroma of the crepes quickly captured our attention and we popped right in. At first site, it's apparent that Nutella is extremely popular given all the giant jars sitting on the front counter. Naturally I decided to get a Nutella with walnuts and bananas. It tasted very good, I love this type of crepe texture because it's chewy and soft unlike some that are crispy. Overall it was quite well done and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Best Nutella and nuts crepe Good dark chocolate crepe Coffee is good also Absolutely will go back"}
{"text":"I remember coming to this restaurant since I was a kid.  Check out this location if you're touring Toronto's Much Music building since it's located just across the street.  Awesome savoury crepes but sometimes can be inconsistent.  Sometimes the crepes can be undercooked whereas other times it'll be perfect."}
{"text":"Came here twice: once a sweet crepe and the other one savoury.  The sweet one was really good but the savoury crepe with spinach, egg and cheese was so bland almost tasteless."}
{"text":"I went to this place last month and wasn't too happy with the waiters service. We had ordered something and ended up getting the wrong crepe as well. When we told the waiter she apologized and left since we didn't want to wait for them to make another one so we ate the one they brought. However, when the manager found out she came and apologized to us herself and packed our original ordered crepe to go and insisted on us taking with us. Now that is what you call service :)"}
{"text":"Standard sweet and savoury crepe options. Nothing special but usually empty enough to satisfy a dessert craving!"}
{"text":"Been here 3x already with besties an we had a good desert crepe; the batter mixture they use is really soft an chewy an complements every sweet toothes desire. Good place to hang an get a quick grub at night! :)"}
{"text":"A friendly waiting staff and a delightful host make this establishment a nice place for lunch. It was my first time at a crÃªpe restaurant--and having made crÃªpes for a long time--I wanted to see how mine compared. I have to say, mine tasted the same (or at least very similar), which was a good thing.  I had the chicken melt; which was also a first for me as I have never put anything other than fruit or jam on mine in the past. The flavour was excellent. I am now going to expand my toppings as a result.  I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something unique or you just want to try a good crÃªpe."}
{"text":"crepes are probably my favorite food. i just love how versatile they are. back when i went to OCAD and first discovered this place, i was pretty ecstatic. i've found that over the years they have gotten a little crappy in service but the crepes are still fantastic.  i usually only opt for savory crepes, especially the spinach, feta, egg crepe with added mushrooms and it's always hugely filling and delicious. they don't use premade crepes here, i've never seen the chef take out a crepe from the fridge and fill it. they have always made the crepes fresh in front of me with batter and then proceeded to fill it. sometimes the egg would be runny but hey, no biggie. the spinach crepe is STUFFED with goodness, it literally is bursting if you get it to go. i definitely get my moneys worth. the dessert crepes on the other-hand are lacking. they spread a thin layer of nutella on the crepe and top it with maybe 2 cut up strawberries, not a fan. but the savory crepes are definite must try for anyone curious.  i've eaten here several times and the service is friendly but it's not as prompt as it use to be. they don't check up on you often so you have to wave them down for drinks. they offer alcoholic drinks so you have an added option of versatility, whether venturing here for a day-time snack or a night-time meal. avoid their flavored milk drinks. it's a waste of money- steamed milk with a shot of flavoring that tastes artificial and chalky."}
{"text":"Stopped for a light breakfast, strawberry crepe was tasty as was the yogurt parfait, definitely not the super sweet overly sugared things you sometimes get. Great coffee too! Good place to stop before shopping..."}
{"text":"Ventured into Cafe Crepe for a late dessert on Saturday night. Yes this place is the famous crepe place in the background of all the cp24 broadcasts. It was very busy at around 11pm and we waited about 5 minutes for a table.  After being pretty stuffed from dinner we decided to split a crepe with nutella, fresh bananas and strawberries. The crepe arrived reasonably quickly, it was reasonably tasty, with a lot of fruit it just didn't sit well with me.   The nutella seemed a little watery and inconsistent which detracted a little bit from the overall crepe. The crepe itself was cooked well, though a personal preference would be a slightly more \"well done\" crepe.  The atmosphere in the place was pretty loud and tables were fairly close together but nothing too bad. A decent place for a quick dessert but nothing earth shattering."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy my first visit here.  I was 37 weeks pregnant and just walking  home from my weekly doctor's visit at 11am when I decided to stop in for a latte, a crepe and to rest my swollen feet.  I waddled inside and placed my order.  I asked if I could be seated at a table or booth so I could rest a bit and was told those were for patrons who were ordering meals and that I had to sit on one of the wobbly high stools against the wall which were clearly unstable for a pregnant woman.  I would have left after that remark but I had already placed the order and needed to eat and couldn't walk any further.  I was appalled and was not expecting that especially at 11am and being clearly pregnant.    Customer service = fail.    The latte was ok, nothing special.  And a crepe is a crepe with simple ingredients you can order at any crepe cafe therefore I will never visit this place again.  I was thankful for them allowing me to use the restroom.  Surprised I was allowed after that experience."}
{"text":"I had a good breakfast here. I ordered the Florentine Crepe and some orange juice. Service was fast, which I was happy about since I was starving. I would say that the Crepe mixture wasn't my favorite but it was good. I think the Crepe was too sweet for a savory dish. The orange juice though was great- freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"Looks fancy but lacks substance. Crepes are okay but nothing that will blow your mind away. For the price they charge, not that great of a deal."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat. The food is good. I've had better crepes before, but I'd have to drive 8 hours to get them, so this is a good substitute. The service is good as well."}
{"text":"Always great Crepes.  Food is very tasty and you can see them make the Crepes in the front.  Always love the food.  Also had Vegetarian panini and the bread was crunchy and nice but there was not much in between."}
{"text":"Really???  If I can make better crepes, it can't be that good!  I understand their desire to be efficient and pre-make the crepes before adding the toppings, but I really think that that this is what is causing the crispy crepe problem!   The crepe filling was not bad, but the crepe was not delightful - it was crispy. Cost was reasonable and I think that if they didn't have so many people waiting (weren't pre-cooking the crepes and then filling them), it probably would've been good.  Maybe I'll give it a try at an off-peak time since, based on all of the positive reviews, it sounds like I might've gotten a dud."}
{"text":"Not like it used to be when it first opened..  The crepes are just okay.   Staff is good but prices are to expensive"}
{"text":"I don't like crepes. Wait...let me rephrase that. I don't USUALLY like crepes. This place is definitely the exception. Delicious. This place redefined the word crepe. I have Been here twice in my two days of travel, and each day was better. Just thinking about it now makes my heart and my mind travel back to my grandmothers house in France. Except, grandmas dead. And this place is VERY MUCH alive. And smells better."}
{"text":"We walked in and right off the bat we were NOT greeted by any smiles or welcoming gestures. I said hello to some of the staff but they just stared at me blankly. Our server greeted us and walked us to our table. We ordered 2 crepes and they were just nothing special. Two bites in it tastes good but then its downhill thereafter. My girlfriends crepe didn't even include any sauce even though that was advertised on the menu.  The staff took some time to bring us our check or ask us if we needed anything else even though it was clear for some time that we were done with our plates.  Prices are reasonable but the experience was just not worth it. WONT be visiting again."}
{"text":"The only place I go to for crepes when I'm in TO! Boyfriend introduced me to it several years go and I've never looked back. It can be chaotically crowded at busy hours as the kitchen is in the FRONT of the restaurant and where the takeout orders line up, but the service is quick and friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS. Especially the desserts. I always need a solid ten minutes to pick what I want and I'm always too stuffed for a dessert crepe if we go out to dinner. They have lots of choices, and a build-your-own option as well. Drinks are great too; when I order hot chocolates or cappuccino, they come in a glass mug with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle and a fabulous LONG HANDLED SPOON! Can't wait to dine here again, not easy since moving and Guelph has a serious lack of crepes and ramen joints...."}
{"text":"Food: 5/10 Atmosphere: 6/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 6.5/10  With all of the innovative and Instagram-worthy dessert places that are popping up, it's making it harder and harder to consider Cafe Crepe for dessert.   As a kid, I loved to watch them make in the windows. My favourite on the menu was the lemon and sugar crepe. I recently had again, and was greeted with a barely warm crepe, and lack of great citrus flavour.   It's a cute place to take kids who may be more used to ice cream, etc, but its lack of innovation and quality of food are keeping it off my to-repeat list.  THE BOTTOM LINE: have it once and then move on."}
{"text":"The 3 times I visited where all great. I tried strawberry and Nutella, lemon, and a yummy peanut butter combo. They make the crepes in front of you and the staff is friendly.  I wish I had time to try more!"}
{"text":"You can't help but notice the fantastic aroma walking by this place. Unfortunately, the taste and texture aren't quite that great. The crepes here are also pricier and service is fairly slow because this place is so busy. However, it has comfy seats, friendly staff, and is at the heart of downtown with lots to do around. Nice place for a date."}
{"text":"First time I was here I had a savoury crepe but I also noticed that there were also sweet crepes. I decided to come back here next time I was in town and get a sweet crepe. I also ordered a hot beverage. Absolutely delicious!  The staff were very friendly and the food came quick to our table. The only problem I have is that the tables seem to be very close together."}
{"text":"Had a nice little snack with the kids today.  I had an omelet done perfect for me and the kids had sugar lol just kidding. We let them have crepes with nutella. We don't feed them that stuff. Daughter 8 enjoyed it with lots of strawberries inside and our son with all kinds of fruit. It was wonderful service. Had to wait about 20mins though but worth the wait. Friendly service.  Was a good experience.  Thx."}
{"text":"I had a crepe with Nutella and bananas. And it was very good. But everything with Nutella gets amazing so I'll probably go back to taste something else and provide a proper review! Great service by the way! Waiters very helpful and polite!"}
{"text":"The crepes are okay but not amazing. Maybe I'm a bit biased living in France for awhile, but I think these crepes are just average."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I absolutely love going to Cafe crepe. We are huge nutella fans and you can pretty much get everything with nutella.  Our favourite is the nutella crepe with bananas and the Nutella milkshake. Absolutely to die for. They also serve great coffee blend from illy that has a nice smooth texture. In addition to that they offer take out and usually always have seating. A good and comfortable ambience.  The best thing is they are open pretty late and located in a central area of toronto across from city TV so a good place to go before a night party. Or simply to stop by for a dessert after dinner.  They also offer savoury flavours in their crepes as well.  A must for! A crepe made very well!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for breakfast our first morning in Toronto.  I got a crepe with Strawberries, Dark Chocolate and Bananas.  Ridiculously good, flavors married together perfectly and there was a good ratio of all of the components to make heaven in my mouth.  My husband got the breakfast sandwich/baguette.   The bread was from a local bakery and so excellent and fresh, he loved it and ate every bite and he doesn't normally eat breakfast at all.  We LOVED it so much we went back the next morning and got the exact same order...boring I know, but it was SO good, I couldn't imagine getting something else, as there was nothing I could do to make my breakfast better."}
{"text":"Their chocolate strawberry and Nutella strawberry crepe was awesome, full of fresh strawberries and not toomuch sweet. Coffees were very good. I loved this place... next time will try savoury crepes"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I love sweet things.  Like this sweet guy who took me here and said this great quote*:  \"All women are a bit crazy at the start.  The worst you can do to me is break my heart.  The worst I can do to you is get you pregnant, drain your bank account, destroy my dental records and take off to Chicago with your car.\"  Bonus points for ice cream from Greg's.  Favourite crepe: lemon and sugar.  Gotta love simplicity.  *Quote was not said at Cafe Crepe.  But same dude.  Whatever."}
{"text":"I remember the first time visiting here, my ex-girlfriend introduced it to me, and I was as much of a skeptic as one could be. Ignorant, unwilling to experiment, I admire her patience in talking me through with coming here.  If you never had a crepe before, it's basically a French taco (except you eat it with a knife and fork). There's a wide variety of selection on the menu, but they're happy to customize your crepe if need be, which is my favorite part about the place. The strawberry crepe was good, I usually order the mushroom and chicken, or the banana & vanilla ice cream if my sweet-tooth starts aching. They are rather generous with what they stuff into your crepe, and the prices are reasonable. Unless you intend on ordering the six dollar espresso.   The place serves as a local cafe for the dying breed of Queen Street yuppie, and a cheap lunch alternative for the staff working at the CityTV building directly across the street.   The cafe is supposed to be French, but the ambiance is remarkably American. Art Deco floors, paintings, furnishing..very 30's. Kind of that fedora wearing, spy vs. spy private detective feeling. I always leave just enough time in between each of my visits to forget which one of the abstract paintings hung outside on the basement washroom door represent which sex.  Trust me, if your name isn't Picasso, figuring out what lies behind door #2 could end up being a lot of guess work. No pun intended.  It's a cafe, but you can order anything from a Nutella Martini, to a Royale with cheese. It's not the Ritz, but it ain't shabby. The place has character.  Considering it's adjacent to a Starbucks, Cafe Crepe has done quite well for itself for the last couple of years."}
{"text":"Had the smoke beef to go. Very yummy and perfect size. It was pretty crowded when I was there but I got my order pretty quick. The guys are fast. Great meal on the go."}
{"text":"It's over priced for what it is. It's not all that good and not that big of a crepe so I was so sad to see all my money gone.   Their speciality hot drinks are great however. Definitely recommend their Nutella cappuccino or something rather.   They could definitely improve and I doubt I'd come back if it wasn't so close to where am."}
{"text":"Cafe CrÃªpes is a fantastic little restaurant set up like a 50's style diner with a modern twist. You sit at tables with black leather booths, paintings of flapper's on the walls around you and modern looking stainless steel fans spinning overhead. I love that the kitchen is on display so you can see them cooking your crÃªpes and preparing your meal as you walk in. It's neat to see and makes the place feel very clean.  The crÃªpes are delicious and just the right size to fill you up at dinner without stuffing you. We ordered savory crÃªpes, stuffed with a mix of eggs, mushrooms, spinach, ham and cheese. Both variations we ordered were delicious! One had the aioli in it which was a great addition.   The service was quick and friendly and the total of our bill came to just $20 tax and tip included! It was the perfect quick meal before we headed to The Second City.   They have cheap beer Wednesday and cheap martini's Thursday's.  I'd happily go back to this place with a group of friends and would love to try their dessert crÃªpes sometime."}
{"text":"Great exterior just on Queen St. West. Luckily it was warm and inviting inside with a bustle going on. The outside weather was too cold for a coastal Californian. After a walk through the entrance way where the chefs are busy creating crepes, paninis and drinks hot and cold, I glanced at the couple of beers they had on tap. Stella & Keiths. Nice but even nicer would be a greater selection. Mill Street Brews in the future? After a brief wait at the inside door we were escorted to our booth by the manager. Excellent service was next and we had the delicious and tart lemon crepe (we had stuffed ourselves with BBQ earlier at another restaurant), a B52 coffee like concoction and a beer.  The place was busy with young people coming in and out all the time.  The decor was comfortable, especially the colorful decorations that matched the color theme of the place. The garlands appeared brand new (fresh?)."}
{"text":"Conflicted on crepes in general.  Food: 4/5 Simple crepes. Service: 4/5 Fast and friendly. Environment: 4/5 Often too busy. Nice decor. Washrooms: 4/5 Okay. Worth it?: 3/5 Still just crepes  I don't know why but I always get excited to come here but always leave feeling like I'm missing something. The crepes are good but at the end of the day a crepe is just a crepe.   Maybe it's just me but homemade crepes on a Sunday morning are better than crepes in a business cafe. Doesn't affect my rating tho. Crepes are still good."}
{"text":"This place is a chain. It does crepes better than most places. It's a good, solid lunch or dinner if you get a crepe and maybe a dessert crepe as well.  Cost is around $8 for my fave the cheese, egg, and spinach."}
{"text":"Craving a crepe? Well look no where else! All the crepes you want in a cheap and tasty manner. Vast and delicious menu with an assortment of crepey goodness. Only downside was the interior design. Inside the furniture is very dark and old. Also the music was odd and even creepy. All in all, best in town crepe at great prices!"}
{"text":"The ambience and location is awesome for a place downtown. Friendly servers, clean washrooms, and decent food.   However, the crepes looked like there was barely any effort put into them and too overpriced for it's worth. I could go to Demetres (another dessert place) and get double the portion for the same price.   We paid around $12 for one crepe that had Nutella, bananas, walnuts, and one piece of chocolate. The plating of the crepe was also disappointing. And around $10 for a crepe called fairytale which only had Nutella, strawberry, honey, and cinnamon. Not worth in my opinion.   To be fair, I've only tried their sweet crepes but I'm skeptical to mission all the way downtown just to eat something I could grab uptown. 3 stars for the environment of the restaurant plus the friendly service, and the fact that they have a lot of variation on their menu."}
{"text":"I've walked passed this place 100 times and never thought to stop (me, a dessert addict, I know right?). At first glance, it looks like just a fast-food crepe place with a counter and small bar area to sit... BUT at second glance, there is an entire restaurant/sitting area towards the back. Very funky decor as well, almost retro with black and white tiles and large 50s-like prints on the wall.  The service was great - quick and friendly, and the crepes really were the best part. Although Cafe Crepe has other items on the menu (and a fairly extensive menu at that), I can only speak to the delicious dessert.   We shared one with strawberries, icecream and suger sprinkled on the top - as a former waffle girl, I may be the latest crepe-convert. It was absolutely delicious, and reasonably priced (around $8 all in).  We also enjoy the vanilla bean tea, and fun Saturday night ambience. Verdict? I will be going back, and cheating on waffles for awhile..."}
{"text":"?????????????????900???????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????  I had banana nutella crepe with vanilla ice cream. Taste so good, want to try again. Nutella latte was also interesting."}
{"text":"Love all their crepes and coffees! My favourite is the Nutella strawberry crepe with a nice yummy espresso with whipped cream. Their prices are bit high and they're usually quick in terms of seating you at a table. It's a nice place to go for a lunch date or when making a quick pit stop while walking downtown."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for Torontorians, especially those who like to hang out around Queen street. The aroma of the crepes in the air is a staple for Queen Street West. You can never go wrong with chocolate and crepes. This is the spot where you can get a quick indulgence of chocolate. It's not the best crepe place in Toronto, but it is a convenient hangout.  I am a lover of nutella so I always get crepes that involve chocolate! There's no going wrong with that. My favourite is the nutella and banana with a side of vanilla icecream. Delish! They have a variety of simple, sweet, and savoury options. I'm sure you will find a flavor that you'll like. It is budget friendly and under $10. Sweet and cheap!  I rate this 4 stars for it's affordability, convenient location, and only it's nutella flavored crepes."}
{"text":"My first exposure to this chain?? was on the west coast in Vancouver. Not wanting to lineup to get a drink I walked in one of their location and  it became a regular fixture for me on my brief stint on the west coast. Surprisingly I had never tried this place in TO. So after a late night flick at the theater nearby someone suggested that we try a crepe and we walked in, it brought back old memories.  They have quick and grab and go area up front and dine in area in the back. The decent sized menu covers a wide range so your are sure to find something (sandwiches recommended) but their claim to fame is the crepes (both savory and sweet). We had a somewhat bigger group and had to wait a few min to get seated. Never mind at least I didn't have to lineup :)  Majority of the group went with the Nutella and Banana Crepe with a few opting for the savory versions.  The drinks are inexpensive and they offer quite a variety of beers (la fin du monde my fav) so its a decent place to get those as well. Maybe they had an off night but the sweet crepes were too firm and almost dry, the savory fared much better. Nevertheless the place doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is decent for what one pays. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite stops on our Toronto vacation. We had a vast array of crepes and we liked them all."}
{"text":"Que \"Cake\" by Rihanna...  Crepe Crepe Crepe Crepe Crepe...Oh I know you like it, it's so enticing...  This was my frist trip to Canada, so enjoying a Crepe was on my list of \"to eat\"...which also happens to be a really long list. We happened to come across CafÃ© Crepe before heading to the Art Gallery of Ontario. I decided to have the Big Monster Crepe, which was full of veggies and bacon. I mean...who doesn't want a monster crepe? As they say..when in Canada..or was that Rome? I digress...  I've always been fascinated with how to make crepes, and my little heart wanted to order everything off the menu. I watched as she ladled the crepe batter onto the hot skillet top, and watched my delicate little pancake come to fruition and be filled with bacon and my veggies for the week. Honestly though, It's a neat process to watch and the smells were amazing. I also ordered a mocha which was much needed on a cold day.   Was this probably the most amazing crepe I've ever eaten? No, but it was pretty tasty, in a good location and the prices were pretty good too. If you're feeling lonely, you can always enjoy a tasty crepe and creep people out, I mean people watch from the window...I mean when in Rome right??"}
{"text":"Very very good! I've never been to a cafe that serves solely crepes but I am impressed right when you walk in it smells so sweet and delicious. They had a vast variety of breakfast and lunch crepes both sweet and savory all ranging around $3-$10 CAD. We got two crepes one strawberry and one French toast, an order of bacon, and a couple of drinks, I had a mimosa and he had a strawberry milkshake. The bill came out to be $37 but it was well worth it, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great food, great lattÃ©s, great service!  A longstanding favourite."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick breakfast. Ended up with $150 parking ticketwhich made it the most expensive breakfast ever. All in all great crepes, ice cream and coffee what more could you ask for. Ham and cheese and Nutella and powdered sugar were amazing and huge. You can't eat the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Nutella and strawberry crÃªpes are mind blowing. Crowded place though. Be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"This place is cool.   You can stay there for a crepe or get it to go.  Plenty of options for savoury or sweet crepes.   As for drinks, fair share of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks for your choosing."}
{"text":"Friendly place located on Queen Street West, they have a good variety of items in the menu. Of course the crepes are the protagonists but they have some other options such as grilled sandwiches, hot dogs, french baguettes... I liked that there was so much to choose from, they also offer some coffee specials with irish cream, grand marnier, brandy and some other items that sounded amazing.  I loved the natural maple syrup crÃ¨pe, it was extremely soft and had a very earthy and sweet taste. I am gonna go back to try more stuff on their menu for sure, I am especially curious about the savoury crÃ¨pes - will update my review soon! :D"}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as crepes in Paris, but still quite good.  I tried a few different things here - a nutella coconut crepe, and two different savory crepes.  One was ham, swiss, mushrooms, and sweet onion aioli, and the other was spinach, feta, chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes, and sweet onion aioli.  Both of the savory crepes were quite good, although not as tasty or as enormous as crepes I've had in Paris.  The nutella-coconut crepe was also pretty tasty.  Plus they seem to be open pretty late, as the first time I went there was on a Sunday night around 10:30PM."}
{"text":"This place has a hispter vibe where loud energetic music but I really dislike the cashier.  I found her a little  rude, because she didn't give me correct change on purpose and I was too tired to argue with her.  The crepe was good though, but for $9 plus tax for the vegetarian option was a little pricey around queens street.  If not the chef who made an amazing crepe and asked me how my day was, I would have given this place a big fat zero.    The ingredients were really fresh though.  I would not come back to this place anytime soon and that's an understatment."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has a good thing going for them. They have a narrow location but it goes back pretty far. It's pushing for a Parisian vibe. It has a very modern look. There are a variety of crepes topping you can get and they are yummy combos. A little pricey but they're pretty big portions. Service is fast. I recommend more for a grab and go."}
{"text":"Lunched there recently with friends, and although the crepes were \"OK\", there was little memorable about the food or experience. Pricing is reasonable, and the crepes aren't soggy, but the fillings were pretty pedestrian...mushrooms were from a can, and vegetable components were a little soggy. One in the party complained that just served tea was only lukewarm, and the server looked confused as to what we wanted her to do about it. It was eventually replaced, but it shouldn't take that much effort, no? Crepes at Jules on Spadina way better."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck place. Love the paninis, and I love the basic crepes (sugar or cinnamon). I don't like overstuffed crepes or savory crepes so can't comment on that. But I visit this place at least once a week for what I mentioned above. Quick take away service. Tasty food. Great prices. You can't go wrong! Grab a crepe to go with a cup of coffee and wander up and down Queen St for a nice evening stroll or date."}
{"text":"I love cafe crepe The food is good, the value awesome, staff is consistently nice Very good little stop for a quick bite"}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Crepe twice now and both times were decent. The first time, I got a savoury crepe (chicken, swiss cheese, egg, mayo). I found the crepe to be on the dry side, but it did have crispy edges which some people might enjoy. The second time I got a sweet crepe (strawberry jam) and the crepe itself was cooked perfectly.   Both times, I went on a Thursday, which is when they have their cheap martinis. Be sure to ask them for the full martini menu since their main menu only lists the Cafe Crepe Signature Nutella Martini. The Nutella martini is a must try for chocolate lovers!  Overall, it's a nice place to stop for a light meal, but there's nothing out of the ordinary here. It's definitely not my favourite crepe spot in Toronto, but the service is quick and the menu has many options for both savoury and sweet."}
{"text":"I went with my friend at 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't too busy and there were plenty of open tables, but we were waiting behind another couple, who left before the waitress noticed them because they were actually being ignored by the staff! I stepped into the further into restaurant and was seated a few moments later.  After looking at the menu, I decided on the crepe Florentine (with swiss cheese, tomato, spinach, and egg) and my friend went for Annie's Chicken Melt (swiss, chicken, tomatoes, sweet onion sauce). The Florentine crepe was so-so: a lot of spinach and tomato, adequate cheese (which ended up congealing into a rubbery consistency), and only a slight hint of egg. Annie's Chicken Melt was a bit better--the sweet onion sauce was delicious--but there was literally only one slice of tomato and the chicken was dry.  Our waitress was one of least attentive waitresses I have ever had. She hung around a table near us and held a fairly long conversation with the couple seated there while we waited for her to pick up our empty plates. After about 10 or so minutes, another waitress eventually came along. The next time our waitress came by, I ordered a nutella latte (delicious, with a very subtle chocolate flavor) and my friend ordered the nutella hot chocolate (also delicious, and not too chocolatey).  Overall, I think the staff here are not that friendly, and we did not feel very welcomed or valued. Needless to say, we didn't leave a hefty tip. The food was all right, but I would not come here again for a meal, it's much better for desserts. I wish I had gotten a sweet nutella banana crepe, or perhaps the sugar lemon, instead as I was still hungry upon leaving the restaurant. The crepes themselves are not huge, but if you want a small breakfast or lunch, they're a great size (I was STARVING when we arrived). What you see on the menu is what you get: there are no sides or extra flavorings in the crepes, which results in rather bland and uninteresting food. You can order soups, salads, and sandwiches, however."}
{"text":"The apple sauce banana crepe was really blend, don't get it. It's just apple sauce, a bit of bananas and lots of crepe, had no taste to it. The portions were very small. We had to drive to Wanda's waffle afterwards to satisfy our need. Wanda's was yummy!  Been here couple of times before and the crepes were okay, the nutella banana one is always good."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. It's always busy and my friends love their crepes. The one flaw with this restaurant is they do not offer gluten free crepes. In this day and age, I find this absurd!  There are so many people with intolerances or celiacs disease that I'm sure it wouldn't hurt them to offer gluten free crepes. In fact, I think it would increase sales. Instead of ordering a crepe, I ordered a bowl of strawberries. They were half the price of a crepe so by offering someone like me a gluten free crepe, I really do feel they will earn more money each night. Please offer gluten free crepes so I can enjoy this restaurant as much as my friends do.   The apple cider was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Best crepe I ever had, fresh and yummy. I was not a fan of crepe but this place changed my mind. We ordered egg, ham and Swiss crepe and Smoked Montreal beef with egg and mustard; Defiantly I'll be back soon. They have wonderful coffee too. Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Above average crepes. A relatively soft crust. Nutella with any fruit is good, or just go for extra Nutella as I do! Ask the waiters for maple milk with real maple syrup, a must try especially in winter!. Service is inconsistent, so don't take it personally."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast, and everything was delicious. The prices were a little high, but my ham and swiss crepe with sweet onion aioli was amazing. With some strawberries on the side, it was a great way to start the day. Not one I could afford every day, but a nice way to splurge on vacation."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and desserts. Part of the entertainment district, this place is great to get your drinks started before a night out. The crepes are also great. I love the French Toast crepe, covered in delicious maple syrup or for savoury, go with the ham and eggs crepe, which never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the crepes, but I wasn't disappointed at all in the varied toppings/fillings that they had available for their delightfully fluffy foodstuffs.  Fresh fruits, candies too.  From afar, the savoury crepes also looked good, but I never got a taste."}
{"text":"Had an illy soy latte to go today; yumz."}
{"text":"Cool creperie in the heart of town to sit down have a snack and a coffee and move on.  It actually has a pretty big selection of crepes, salty or sweet.  It also features in the front an area to for quick service take out."}
{"text":"BAD thick crepes, I would not come here again. Anyone who thinks the crepe quality is good here doesn't know better.  I ordered a strawberry and banana crepe and ordered a vanilla scoop on top.  The crepe itself was thick and there was soo much excess crepe that I didn't have anything to eat it with.  The ice cream was like the cheapest vanilla ice cream you can get. just gross."}
{"text":"Nice seating arrangements. Clean washrooms. Interesting floorplan. Good service.  Crepes taste good. Price is alright. Customizing your own toppings and flavors a plus.  Bring your own chopsticks."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for years. I was running errands and said: today is the day!! What a disappointment. For $9.75 I got 3 pieces of greasy bacon.. not nicely cooked and dried.. but wet greasy bacon; 1 crepe with maple syrup and some scrabbled eggs. Very sad looking on my plate. Then $4.25 for my medium sized glass of OJ. No one came by to ask how I was doing."}
{"text":"At first glance this place seems like only takeout but there is actually a spacious dining room in the back!  The sweet crepes here are well made and portioned. I think the only improvement that could be made is a wider selection of sauces for the savoury crepes (hollandaise or bÃ©chamel go great on a ham & swiss crepe!)."}
{"text":"The waitress with the funky hairdo was incredibly friendly (not obnoxious tho), professional and attentive.  She was 5 min late with my coffee and fell over backwards apologizing then gave it to me for free.  CS is not dead!  Oh yeh, crepe r yummy for your tummy."}
{"text":"If you are craving crepes or sandwich fares, you can stop by this place. The crepes are decent and taste like how you would expect crepes to taste. It's not spectacular but not terrible. There aren't as many toppings in the crepe as I'd like and it doesn't have the wow factor that I was looking for in a crepe."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation and wanted a crepe. I ordered the Crepe Florentine for breakfast. It was good.   We also ordered a sweet crepe with bananas, dark choclate, walnuts, caramel and whipped cream. It was pretty good. Sweet but not too sweet.   I would come here again, next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick bite to eat. They had a great variety of options. About 4-5 vegetarian savoury crepes, some great sweet crepes and more. I absolutely loved the crepes, they were the right amount of soft and crunchy in the places that it needed to be. They package it nicely so you can just take it on your way out. The crepes were all under 10$ and they really filling. Service was nice, everyone was quick to give you your order."}
{"text":"There are few breakfast places offering good vegetarian options, Cafe Crepe being one of them! So we decided to brave on a Snowy Sunday morning entering the cafe as first customers !  We ordered for Le Vegetarien (Savoury Crepe) and Sweet Crepe with chocolate, banana and strawberries. The order took a while to arrive (first customers?), while we enjoyed the Parisian styling of the cafe...  Both crepes tasted perfect, midway we realized that we needed something on the side, so we ordered for hash browns. The coffee and Cappachino were fine. Overall experience as good, certainly in my collection for future visits."}
{"text":"Very delicious crepes. The place was quite full on a Friday night which is always a good sign. I had chicken crepe and it was excellent. The service was good and very friendly. Also I had banana chocolate crepe for desert which was good as well. Will definitaly come again."}
{"text":"We waited 45 mins for our food. When it came out, it was the wrong order. (For both me and my friend!) it took another 15 minutes for our server to get our bill after we asked for it.   Management, figure out your service. Your food is good but come on... really?"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely mind blasting experience here yesterday.  That's mostly related to the service quality - my friend and I wanted to order a dessert after the main dishes and our lovely server offered to time it so that it arrives right after we finish eating our meals. And it did happen exactly on time.   Moreover, she also split our bill AND split our shared dessert crepe between us w/o us even asking to do so! I always give kudos (in terms of higher tips) to the restaurants/cafes that split my bills without giving me grief for doing so, but this just exceeded all my expectations (honestly how often do you get a split shared dessert/meal on your bill w/o asking for it?)  Well in short: I love this place=)  And yeah dark chocolate+caramel crepe is delicious and so is vegetarian one=)"}
{"text":"Always wanted to check this place out as I walk by it all the time. Smell of crepes is so good. The crepe options weren't that great and service was mediocre. Mediocre dessert place imo."}
{"text":"Best dessert shop on Queens!  My favourite place to go for lunch and the most wonderful place to take your friends for a little get together, atmosphere is great and not too fancy.  Very comfortable but be sure to get there before 7:00 if possible! The line gets super long because it's so popular with the student crowds, especially on a Thursday or Friday."}
{"text":"I walk by this place twice a day, every day, trying to resist the wonderful smell of crepes.  Well, I finally tried their nutella banana crepe which was absolutely delicious!  Great place for a dessert, but they also have savory crepes and sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"$3.50 beers on a Friday downtown?! Insane! Great service, tons of stuff on the menu, and an awesome place for dates or a group of friends. The seating is a bit compact though."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see it listed here, and surprised to see that Cafe Crepe was nearly full at nine tonight-- in Vancouver, Cafe Crepe's a chain, and it seemed to me the McDonald's of the crepe world. But I guess there's just the one store here, and apparently a busy one at that!  The crepes here aren't anything special, and overpriced. If not freshly made (they pile up the crepes premade), they're freshly prepared with the ingredients you choose. They're tasty enough, and the service is pretty quick. Still, you're bound to find better crepes elsewhere-- but probably not late at night, I guess!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my appointment at the nail place nearby and decided to come here. The crepe was good - could be better if there's more strawberry. The reason that I didn't give them 5/5 is because it's hard to rate a crepe 5/5 or 1/5 - the making process is standardized and you can never screw up, or amaze your customers."}
{"text":"I have been to CafÃ© crÃªpe a few times and have always had a good experience. Our server Mattia was extremely helpful and kind. He really did make a difference and I would really recommend this place for a relaxed crÃªpe in the core of Toronto."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the crepes are expensive here for the portions that they give out but I really enjoyed their cocktails! My friends and I shared 1 together. I understand the area makes everything more expensive but I just thought the price to cost ratio was a bit crazy for the food (as a person who cooks, I know how much things can cost, and it looked too expensive for what it was). I guess I have mixed feelings on the place but I might come here for drinks again. Verdict's still out."}
{"text":"This is my goto place for crepe in downtown Toronto. I love the Chicken melt. And for sweets, always good with the Nutella. Crepe is pretty authentic, not much difference compare to the ones I have in France. They also serve regular breakfast. If you like crepe, gonna give this place a try!"}
{"text":"By far this little restaurant is one of the best things about Toronto: good crepes in a casual environment. We met some friends here and wanted to return multiple times on our very short trip. Food was delicious and affordable, and the wait staff were very helpful. I'm very happy to have eaten here, and totally want to return next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The crepe here is no Crepe a Go Go. But it's sure quite yummy.   I usually come and have a quick lunch here, sit down on my own, shopping on queen street. It's also great for a small group. The folks are friendly and the meal is quite simple, crepe or paninis.   Today I got take out. They did serve it to me in a paper bag, so i can eat it on the Go, but something about it wasn't quite right. Not sure if it's the solid-ity of the thing, it sticks out of the bag and keeps flopping over. I had a hard time eating it without also eating paper - maybe the bag had to be higher. Not sure what it is, but it was a difficult on the go eating experience.   Good for lunch, mid/after shopping, chatting, dessert."}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe is almost always crowded but I'd say its for its location and not its food. Although Cafe Crepe is relatively quick to serve, and isn't super expensive the service staff always seem rushed and the crepes are average at best.   When we first walked in, it took 10 minutes and us having to waive down a waitress before the host came to ask us if we'd like to dine in. After waiting another 15 minutes for a table, the menus came.   Although the crepes came relatively quickly, the order was wrong. We informed the waitress but it took another 20 minutes before our fixed order came - at this point, one of our drinks were forgotten.  The crepe itself was fine, but the constant rush of patrons and servers made the experience a bit too hectic.  If you're hankering for a crepe, maybe try their takeout window."}
{"text":"Service was fast, friendly and crepe was delicious! We were seated quite quickly and the waitress still apologized for the wait.   I went with a group on a Friday evening around 11pm. Everyone enjoyed their crepes.  I got sugar and butter (around $3.85) with ice cream ($1.5) - yum yum yum. Fresh, hot, made-to-order crepes -good dessert joint!"}
{"text":"I am a total sucker for the ambiance here so it gets full stars. Ever since visiting (once in a blue moon) as a kid, I'm living my dream now working a block away. The $4 coffee and lemon sugar crepe combo is fantastic, along with their classic French staples - jambon et fromage, delicious breakfast sandwiches and fresh greens. Though it isn't anything mega fancy, food wise, prices are manageable and nothing beats the European vibes in the heart of Toronto's downtown."}
{"text":"Got the chestnut crepe with whipped cream. Absolute heaven. The place was very busy on a Saturday but service was great. We also got a Nutella latte also very delicious."}
{"text":"The worst place. I got sweet and veggie crepes and they were cold. He reused the crepe and warmed it up with the filling. I was so disappointed. Definitely never going back."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with a friend here at noontime. I'd last eaten here a decade ago, and was curious--if a bit afraid--as to what I might find. I'd only eaten a dessert crepe here: was it really fit for non-dessert crepes? (That my friend was from Montreal made it only a bit more fraught.)  Happily, Cafe Crepe was wonderful. The $9.75 breakfast special, offering customers one of six crepes with sides of bacon/sausage and eggs done however, hit the spot, while the coffee was a well-done and energizing light roast. (Refills were free.) It would have been nice if there was a side of fruit to the breakfast, but all in all it was excellent food. The service was also good, too."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Crepe a couple of times and both were rather delightful, the first time I had a a savory crepe filled with ham, cheese and mushroom and a nutella hot chocolate, be still my beating heart, it almost was!  Being more health conscious the second time I visited, I had the pear, avocado and brie salad...fantastic! I did have a nibble of my friends chocolate and strawberry crepe and it was tasty.  I really like the decor of this place, and the atmosphere. Both times I have been it was really busy yet the service was spot on and it did not feel overly crowded."}
{"text":"CafÃ© Crepe delivers a very impressive menu with a number of creative choices.  We visited on a Saturday afternoon, and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a table.  The service was decent, but the crepes were delicious.  I had dark chocolate with nuts and a scoop of strawberry ice-crÃ¨me - nothing too exotic but very satisfying nonetheless.  The dÃ©cor was somewhat bland, and definitely didn't match the vibrancy of their food offerings.  While the crepes were amazing, I'd try other places before returning back here."}
{"text":"A great place to be at any time of the day!   I usually get a savoury crepe followed by a sweet one and share. The server last night  split our savoury crepe into two for us without us even asking, so sweet.   Savoury: chicken, Swiss cheese, egg & mayo is a must. Simple but delicious.  Sweet: anything with Nutella in it- can't go wrong.   Quick service and price is very reasonable (everything under $10)."}
{"text":"It's been a few years but Madame it seems has sold the business. It sad that it is not quite the same.  The interior has changed, the food has changed, but they still have crepes and croissants but like all things that come and go, things change.  I miss my casual snippets of  Bonjour, Ãa roule?  Comme d'hab!  Je voudrais un cafÃ© et un croissant avec \"hotdog\" and sometimes when I finish my meal, I exclaim C'Ã©tait vraiment dÃ©licieux ! when the occasion deemed it.  Today they are different here in this location.  The staff are all very friendly but I don't get that French Vibe.  Coffee is still good, prices are decently, maybe cheaper than when Madame ran the place.  Her little touches are gone, but the place is still there to serve up what people want. A place to enjoy a coffee on this block with some crepes.  I do miss that old town vibe.  She brought back a little of the French Canadian in my out that was long forgotten and now it seems I must find my way again.  So now, it's just a nice little coffee shop that doesn't cost me an arm and a leg, but it's not the same for me.  It's just a place to meet  up and gather for chit chat, and not for a simple muse and to be able to listen to the background coffee sounds interjected with bonjour with each customer at the cashier."}
{"text":"They have $5 take out specials, 3 basic crepe choices (recommend the sugar butter one), and a coffee - only if you take it to go.  If you sit down, you get a whole lot of choices. This isn't demetres style where its loaded with crazy toppings nor is it super sweet to put you into a sugar coma. Recommend their strawberry banana nutella crepes.  Ice cream is an additional add on, and I think they only had vanilla, very plain so it's up to you.  They are open pretty late too.  Located near Paramount aka Scotiabank Theatre."}
{"text":"The service here is the only thing my friend and I seem to have trouble with. Sometimes it's spot on, other days it is so horrid we actually need to walk to the registers ourselves to get the check. Now with that being said, we only come here for dessert, so I cannot speak of their other types. I have read the menu many times, however I can't get past a strawberry-Nutella with bananas and a tall glass of cold milk for a drink.  I wish they also understood what the term \"extra\" means. We have ordered here enough times to know what the basic crepe has inside of it. So when we order something with \"extra\" it should be noticeable, however this is not the case most of the time. The most recent is we asked for extra Nutella and it actually seemed like they held some back. Maybe it's because it will mess up the crepe if they put too much on? I dunno, then put it on the side... Either way the crepes we have here are most of the time satisfying enough to allow us a return visit.   The noise on a Friday night is pretty hectic, so if you want to have a nice conversation with your friend at this time, choose a different place to eat."}
{"text":"Seated right away, we started with Nutella lattes.  Fantastic. On to the ham and swiss for me and the feta and spinach for her.  Very tasty. Finished with the fresh strawberry and whip cream. Oh man!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  I loved the strawberry, banana, and Nutella crepe that I got.  Usually I don't think there is enough Nutella, but everything was perfectly proportioned and completed filled me."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and got the Nutella coffee and the Chicken Melt crepe! Both were delicious!!! Staff was very nice too"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best thing about this restaurant is its location. My co-workers and I were looking for a place that wasn't packed on a Friday night and stopped by here since it fit the criteria. Not to mention the scent of crepes also drew us in. I would consider these crepes to be overpriced just based on what you get. Large groups (there were 8 of us) are charged a 18% gratuity which is pretty standard so keep that in mind if you're with a larger group.   I got the Nutella and fresh strawberry crepe and unfortunately the strawberries did not taste or look fresh at all. Maybe they were prepped a few days ahead, but they were comparable to the canned strawberries you'd get on your funnel cakes. I would also skip the scoop of ice cream, it just tasted like the standard chapmans ice cream.   Overall, this place is convenient if you're looking for refuge from the cold, but I would never go out of my way to come here. There are definitely better crepe places in the city!"}
{"text":"3.5 pretty good food.  baja crepe and nutella crepe 3.5.  tje nutella crepe could have used some.more love.  ive been go crepe.places before a lot more generous in terms of filling and toppings.  this place fell in the mediocre category in terms of that.  the baja crepe was delicious.    service was alright.  not spectacular but decent.  a couple of pointers .... keep more of an eye ..on the crowd.  look around more.  food was not fast a tad slow but over all good exprience"}
{"text":"Service was great, waiter was nice, the ham, swiss and chesse, egg crepe was soooo delicious....it just totally melts in your mouth...like OMG! I dont have anymore to say...like I'm sooo coming here with my boyfriend for a date...haha wish i had one though...anyways enough about my sad love life....anyways, yeah...check out this awesome place"}
{"text":"Great place !! We went there on a Sunday night for dinner. I ordered the vegetarian crepe, and it was exquisite . The texture of the crepe was very crunchy on the sides and smooth on the inside, just how i like it!  The decor is cute and there's quite a bit of sitting space which is convenient for studying or just spending time with loves ones.  I'll come back for sure !!"}
{"text":"A tasty breakfast, but nothing to write home about.  I love crepes. I love pancakes, waffles, anything with that vanilla and butter-flavoured batter. In Europe, crÃªpes are pretty standard hand-food, available for on-the-go nosh in most big cities, and they make me so very happy. I am poised to be delighted.  The place is open and clean, the street-front take out window is a fun idea, and it smells *great*. Coming in for breakfast, I want a better selection than I'm getting -- their menu has 20 or so savoury choices, but only because every minor variation gets its own entry (egg and ham, egg and ham and cheese, egg and ham and cheese and mushroom, egg and spinach, egg and spinach and cheese, &c &c). They do let you construct your own, but first thing in the morning, I could do with some more creative hand-holding.  When I do make a choice, the prices sting a little. $10+? For a breakfast crÃªpe? In the grand scheme of things, it won't bankrupt me, but neither is it the best bargain in town. Please, Cafe CrÃªpe, help me avoid the $3 sodium bomb sausage mcmuffin at the starbucks next door!  The product itself is delish. Just what the doctor ordered. The crÃªpe is what I want it to be: light and aromatic, but with enough firmness to hold the goodies in. The spinach is fresh. The cheese is gooey. The mushrooms are... podunk ho-hum button mushrooms, but fresh ones, at least.  At $6, this would be a great deal. At $10 with interesting field mushrooms or some creative cheese choices or a well-curated menu of awesome, I'd be happy to pay it. As it stands, you won't leave hungry, but you won't leave thrilled by the value, either.  Pro-tip: the right thing to do here might be to show up later, when the \"sweet\" side of the menu takes over. Or have a nutella crÃªpe for breakfast..."}
{"text":"GREAT crepes! also very good coffee and salads (well it's strawberry with nutella!), good prices, service is a little slow"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for something sweet after lunch. It was pretty crowded for a rainy Saturday afternoon so we couldn't sit in the dining area; not a big deal as they have seating (high chairs) in the take away waiting area. I ordered a sweet crepe - banana and Nutella. Pricing is pretty standard for crepes in the city. I can't pin point it, but it was just a-ok for me. Nothing about this place blew me away. Anyway, it does the trick if you're looking for something sweet.   Good for: getting your sweet on"}
{"text":"Crepe Cafe is located in one of Toronto's trendy parts of the city.  Food is really cheap, they have a high volume of people who come to eat here and a lot of young people dig the place  Drawbacks:  Sometimes glasses aren't as clean as they should be.  The magic behind a crepe is kinda ruined when you loads of Nutella out on display.  (Don't get me wrong, i sometimes indulge in Nutella at home... its a wonderful chocolate hazel nut spread... but sometimes i wish i was getting an in-house made spread instead of store bought product.  Positives:  All the crepes are made with fresh ingredients ... some of the best ones are those made with fruit (but they kinda get messy when eating on a street car and are often gone after only a few stops.)  They make the crepes in house ... just hope that you get your crepe fresh because they have to make large batches of them to accommodate the number of orders they get.  Service is fast, the place can accommodate large groups.  Has a large enough selection that a group can agree to eat here and be satisfied.  Price wise very affordable."}
{"text":"Dined in with a friend around 8pm on a weekday; Pretty filled with young people and we didn't have to wait in line. Has great atmosphere and friendly waitresses. I ordered the french toast crepe, which came to $10 tax and tip included.   I must say, the portion is large and very filling (I couldn't finish it). A lot of cinnamon and it's not too sweet because there's like a drizzle of maple syrup. I'm not sure if the egg was seasoned before folding it into the crepe. After a couple of bites though, the crepe became chewy and like glutinous rice after a while-not so great.   The biggest disappointment was the food presentation: my crepe was off centered on the plate and the chocolate drizzle on my friend's crepe was in blobs and sloppy; not like in the picture. Crepes without garnishes (dusting, syrup etc) looks like a plain pale triangle. We eat with our eyes right? They could do a better job with plating.  Oh, and their paninis are tiny; more like 2-3 bruschetta pieces to me."}
{"text":"The amazing smells from within really are what brought me to this place. Ordered a chicken, egg, and mayo crepe and loved it.  It's made right before your eyes.  Even though it was fairly busy, my order came in decent timing.  Interested in trying something mire in the sweeter side next time."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to crepe heaven!!!! Sooo many different varieties!!! I got the French toast one 2 days in a row!! Can I say AMAZE BALLS!!! Sweet and Savory of course.... i didn't know what to expect, eggs, cheese, cinnamon and icing?!?! Odd combo but it was well worth it!!! The lemonades a delicious!! The raspberry and the Peach are to die for!!   All in All, can't wait to visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Very cute joint! Server was a bit bitter but my crÃªpe was super sweet! As a trendy millennial, I tried to make a cute boomerang on my Instagram as you can see (tried being the operative word). Food wise, I got the Nutella, strawberry and cinnamon but they have tons of other savoury options too so definitely a just dessert! :)"}
{"text":"Crumbly, tasteless chicken and barely melted cheese shoved into a dry crepe that tasted like it had been made the day before. My water was never refilled and it took forever to flag down the server for my bill. If you're going to act like you don't want customers, the least you could do is bring the bill quickly so both you and I can get on with our lives."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends after dinner as we wanted to satisfy our dessert cravings. It was quite busy when we arrive but luckily we were able to get a table. They have quite a decent space for dining in and also a takeout area if you wanted something to go. They have a special feature going on- the pumpkin Spice Crepe. I'm a little bias when it comes to anything with pumpkin in it but it was quite delicious nonetheless. Our crepes came out quickly and the staff here are super friendly and great. They also have a bar as well and serve some of the cheapest alcoholic drinks in the city so you enjoy drinks and desserts at the same time. Overall, a pretty decent dessert place. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other desserts. Definitely recommend it here if you love crepes!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a while now but never bothered reviewing them. Staple food that I try here is the Nutella hot chocolate and Nutella crepe with almonds (whipped cream on side) (NO ITS NOT TOO MUCH NUTTY, Trust!).  Last night I made it there at 10.01pm and they closes at 10. However, the cashier there (Girl you are the best) still took my order even though the chef (or the guys in the kitchen) were reluctant to take my order (I understand working long hours is hard, no complaints) just cause it would have been unfair since they still didn't make the last call! Best day ever!"}
{"text":"Not the place to visit when you're in a rush! I had an hour to kill before an appointment and went here since I love crepes! The Nutella strawberry crepe was delicious!! Well worth the wait!!  I also ordered the strawberry milkshake, for which the portion was surprisingly big.  Overall, love this place and would visit again."}
{"text":"We do not have H & M in Austin, so I was beyond excited to find one just a few blocks away from our hotel. Unfortunately, it didn't open until 11:00am, so we decided it was a good time to have some breakfast.     Sadly, my only previous experience with a crepe has been at IHOP so I was not terribly excited about sucking down a powdered sugary, fake fruit-filled, syrupy, flaking thing before trying to squeeze into clothes.   Stupid, stupid American.  I had no idea there was such a wide variety of crepes to select from. Even though it seemed like ingredients I would never mix myself; I ordered the eggs, mushroom, tomato,  (and cheese?) crepe with maple syrup.  The tomatoes were a mistake and quickly plucked those out.  Otherwise the crepe was scrumptious and light and I ate the entire thing even though I intended to only eat half. You know, in preparation to try on clothes.    A gal's got her priorities.  It may be because we were the only guests, but the service was impeccable. Our server was polite, attentive and our meal came out much more quickly than I had anticipated."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place by accident as lost Toronto tourists. It ended up being an absolutely amazing place for crepes! I got the chocolate and coconut crepe, and my fiancee got the chocolate and strawberry crepe. Both excellent choices, I think! If you want a deliciously sweet breakfast or brunch, Cafe Crepe is a great place to try!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for a bite of dessert after knocking around Toronto and having a light dinner. We had not read reviews before going in. I did before reading this, and am not certain what some people are complaining about.  Is it a tourist trap? No. The people we observed - and seating is close - were locals doing exactly as we were. Was the service snooty? No, our server was very pleasant, even though we are plainly tourists.  We ordered something called the Fairytale, which was a crepe with Nutella, honey, cinnamon, and strawberries. The strawberry portion was generous and the crepe was easily enough for both of us. It was sweet, obviously, but not in just one way. There were layers of sweetness that we found pleasant.  The crepe itself was just a bit chewy and cooked well. They're not easy, but not hard. A place that has \"crepe\" in the name should get it right every time. Ours was. Odd that others did not have the same experience.  We enjoyed our brief time here, and are considering going back for breakfast, just because we observed them making savory crepes and they looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Their crepes are absolutely amazing. The Nutella and Strawberry crepe is to die for. Cafe Crepe was the first restaurant we found once arriving in Toronto via bus. It was early, and we were hungry, but it wasn't quite lunchtime yet...and their crepes certainly hit the spot! The venue is also very quaint, which was a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Cafe Crepe pretty often, at least once a week. We like the fact that this is supposed to be a \"Â frenchÂ \" environnement. Service is fast and food is tasty (not extraordinary but good enough for the price !). We actually like most of the staff, but I don't give 5  because this is hella loud and noisy, we barely hear each other. During winter, the air conditioner is ON and right over every table (almost) and this drives me crazy. Also, I don't match their schedule, they close the kitchen way too early during the week, I can't make it when I work late. This is not a bad review, but I'm picky and I like this place, I just would like them to improve themselves. Aside from that, this is a place to try !"}
{"text":"Love hanging out at this place after a movie with friends.  Great staff, Cafe Mocha made to perfection and a fantastic array of crepes to choose from.  Throw in a nice young and hip crowd and you have the sweet spot in toronto to chill, drink latte and savour some dessert.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There is a reason the kitchen is in the front window, and the window is open:  so as you walk by your eyes and nose are immediately attracted. You can only walk past this place so many times before you need to go in.   The variety alone will kill you!  Between the long list of savoury and sweet crepe creations, there is something for everyone. I had just finished dinner, so desert was in order. I had the dark chocolate, caramel and coconut crepe. It was the perfect blend of flavours and sweetness.   The worst part of waiting for my take-away crepe was in watching other crepes being made. I seriously wanted to change my order several times before my order was in my grasp. The angst of wondering if you've made the right decision is a killer. But there is always next time..."}
{"text":"Yummy crepes! Very nice service! The server came by asking us if we wanted a free crepe as the kitchen had accidentally made an extra one. Would never say no to more crepe!"}
{"text":"When I first heard of this place I was a bit worried... I have a big appetite, and usually dessert places don't cut it for me. However I was (pleasantly) surprised to discover that their crepes can be filling enough. They have two crepes on the first page they recommend, and those two would be what I recommend too. Good atmosphere and good food.  I'll be back to this place."}
{"text":"Very good but I am sorry to be snobbish, nothing like a REAL french Crepe. However, 4 stars for plenty fresh tasting spinach in my Crepe, resisted the Nutella one which I know is probably amazing. Overall good, check it out:)"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be like a decade ago but how can anyone go wrong with Nutella and whatever. I'd go back and try something else. So much on the menu. Just wish that the crepe was made as we ordered. I wouldn't mind waiting a bit longer for it. And yes, I agree with a previous patron, the staff aren't friendly."}
{"text":"Came here back in December after having past by Cafe Crepe a million times and staring at the cooks turn the crepes round and round on the crepe maker. This place is usually packed so I expected it to be once I arrived with my sisters. Once I got there, the cafe itself was busy but the walk in area wasn't too bad. I took a quick look at the menu by the register and got the regular crepe with just nutella while my sisters got the nutella and strawberries crepe.   I had been craving a crepe so I knew whatever I got I was going to enjoy it and I did. The crepe was really hot that the chocolate almost burned the roof of my mouth. These crepes can get pretty messy and they are only handed to you with a piece of hand paper which I thought was a little weird. At least if they had handed it to use with napkins that had the Cafe Crepe logo on it, it would make sense..  My sisters strawberry and nutella crepe was a little hard for them to eat that I had to give them my own paper towel napkin as the wet strawberries poured through the paper they put the crepe in and began dripping down there hands. - really messy if you ask me. They enjoyed the crepe however it wasn't anything too spectacular. I prefer ice cream in my crepes but the Nutella did it enough justice for my craving.   Would have been nice to stay in the cafe itself however, there is limited spacing so if you are looking to get a seat at night..good luck!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a lot of breakfast places in downtown, but I would definitely go there again. Their crepes are really nice and they have an open kitchen model, you can see how they are making the crepes and the aroma of it is very relaxing(for a lack of better word). I had a chicken with swiss cheese in crepe, and it was delicious. We also had banana, strawberry and nutella crepe and that was divine! Just the perfect amount of sweet and perfect amount of everything else. Our server was not having a great day as it was pretty busy the time we went, but the main lady(manager?) who works there was very polite and cheerful, so I am not counting that against my review. The environment is a bit dark and cozy and that comes down to everybody's preference."}
{"text":"I do love to meet people here, but why?  The crepes aren't even that good.  The hot chocolate is grainy/sandy/nasty.  The servers are rude and inattentive, the tables are totally uncomfortable, and did I mention the disappointing hot beverages?  It's expensive too - especially for the quality (or lack thereof).  The kitchen staff are usually scowling (not good in an open-concept kitchen) and the wait staff I've experienced (over 4-5 visits) have all been grumpy and surly. As others have noted, there are frequent order mistakes and the service is notoriously slow... are these the same kind of crepes they serve on the street in Paris? It can't be! Those ones only take 90 seconds from ordering fresh to get into your hands... these ones take 20 minutes to prepare. Odd.  Anyway, there are better places in the city for crepes. This one just has the luck of a great location and lots of space to meet people."}
{"text":"Yum noms! My friend and I went last night, a Friday around 1230am.     Atmosphere: Calm and intimate, but still good for groups  as there was an top next to us and on the other side a couple. Its good for all types and all night. I love the setup for those ordering take out, you stay in the front section of the restaurant. If you're going to dine in, which we did, you walk through a glass door into the dining area. I think with the dark lighting and location on Queen street I expected and would have preferred some music. Perhaps des chansons francais aussi. Edith Piaf, Gregroie, Celene Dion?? Ha ha ha ne porte qui!  Food & Drinks To drinks I ordered a medium hot chocolate. Nice presentation with a dollop of whip cream on top (something I personally could do without) BUT it tasted as chocolatey as my friends steamed milk with flavor and was served only moderately hot. This [my drink] was the biggest disappointment of the night. I mean geez, it's hot chocolate - err on the side of caution with too much chocolate and piping hot, not the opposite when its -10 out. My friend ordered steamed milk with strawberry flavor. She enjoyed it, and I can say it was what it said it was steamed  milk with flavor.  The eats! We had had a filling dinner (see review for Paramount Fine Dining) so we knew we didn't each want our own crepes. We shared a classic crepe of strawberry and nutella. It was great. Only complaint if I have to have one, the strawberries were obviously not freshly cut so the mix of cool strawberries, room temp nutella melted by the warm crepe was not there and maybe some powdered sugar? But such a finishing touch is perhaps more of a personal preference, no?Admittedly we were probably the last table they sat around 1230 am so they were close to closing and who is going to cut up a batch of fresh strawberries for us? I'm not that famous yet.  I love that they [and their kitchen] are open late - 1am on Fridays/Saturdays = Huge bonus after leaving the surprisingly early closing area of yonge-dundas  Service It was fine. I think the guys at the front area were more friendly than our particular waitress. But she got our drinks and food out in a timely manner and cleared our plates accordingly so nothing wrong there.  Bang for my Looney? Yup! And the menu has numerous offerings that we decided after sitting down not too hungry that we had to come back and properly do the restaurant. I shall return! La semaine prochaine est trop tot? Non!"}
{"text":"The crepes are good don't get me wrong, but to charge extra for every single topping like cinnamon and whip cream?...and almost 3 dollars extra for a few thin slivers of strawberries?... common...that's pretty lame, you get lured in by the cheap prices but once you construct something half decent to eat, you're digging deep into your pockets and didnt even get a chance to add ice cream yet. Also, why are there no prices on the menu facing the street?...."}
{"text":"The coffee was very good.  The crepe was ok.  The baguette was clearly not toasted enough.  Service was good.  The seats and tables are so close to each other you can clearly hear the conversation of your neighbors."}
{"text":"This is one if my favorite breakfast spots in the area. The crepes are amazing, the mimosas are actually a full small bottle of prosecco with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. What's not to like!  Prices are very reasonable too.  They also have great sandwiches and more lunch type meals.  On Wednesdays they have cheap martinis!"}
{"text":"If you have worked up an appetite while shopping on Queen W, swing by here for a delicious bite!  Obviously it's the crepes that draw you in.  They have a pretty decent selection of crepes and I like how the menu is broken up into savoury crepes and sweet crepes.  We had the chicken melt crepe (savoury one - had chicken, swiss cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes) and a sweet crepe (dark chocolate, strawberries and bananas).  A nutella milkshake sealed the deal.  Overall everything was yummy, but I do wish with the savoury crepe there was some rosemary or something to give it a bit of herb-y flavour.  The prices are decent and the portions are just riiiiight for me!  The place has that 50s diner feel - black/white checked floors, red walls, black booths and old school art on the walls  Service is quick and friendly - there is seating in the back and a take out section in the front."}
{"text":"Crepes are really good, service is great, location is perfect, what more could you ask for  Although I`ve never actually been here for lunch or dinner but just dessert, it has never dissapointed me. Even if you don`t eat here at least go and stand outside and watch the \"chefs\" make the crepes and smell the amazing scent of Canadian Crepes!  As another Yelper mentioned definitely try the nutella and banana crepe! I also was not dissapointed in the Irish and Spanish Coffee`s, they are really good on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"I got a chicken crepe and it was so plain. When the waitress brought it to my table, I looked at it and thought to myself \"are you sure this is finished?\".  There was no sauce or garnish on top. It just had some chicken and cheese in it. Aside from that, the wait was very long, especially considering how plain it was.  Crepes are easy to make and shouldn't take more than 10-15 min to prepare.  I also got the Mandarin orange Italian soda.  Not what I was expecting but after I asked the waitress for cream and sugar, it was much better. If you get an Italian soda, make sure you ask for cream and sugar.  Not sure why this place was so busy. For a place called Cafe Crepe, they aren't that good at making them."}
{"text":"We had crepes and they were amazingly good! Nice place. In the middle of downtown Toronto, near the CN Tour. Was great experience and customer service!  Must Try : Baja Chicken crepe & Nutella lattÃ©!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Decided to try crepes for breakfast and saw that this place was open. I wasn't in a hurry buy had a time constraint due to a 1:07 first pitch at Rogers Center.  This place had great tasting food, amicable and prompt service and very fast turnout. We were in and out in 35 minutes, including an additional order after our food arrived. The Breakfast Baguette is a solid start to the day and the crepes were amazing. The Nutella crepe with fruit seems to be a popular one with the locals. I had dark chocolate and strawberries and wasn't disappointed. Also try the ginger tea with honey. I definitely look forward to coming back to this place when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"My go to place for a quick bite to eat. There was a time when I came here religiously for their Montecristo coffee. I loved Grand Marnier and espresso! Now, not so much! But I still come here on dates or on my own. I love their crepes and overall menu. This is a place that although you can be a regular patron, I can see how the staff may not recognize you due to the busy downtown location."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with a wide variety of crepes at good prices and a small selection of other breakfast items. You can either get \"to go\" orders or sit down. We were one of three groups eating at 10am on a Wednesday and we had great service; we had our food within 8 minutes. My crepe was filled to the max with nutella and banana slices and was super tasty!"}
{"text":"Somehow magically beating the dinner rush on a Friday night (it's jam packed with people waiting by 8pm) all 6 of us got sat almost as soon as we walked in. The restaurant was already looking quite full at point.   I got the spinach and feta cheese which was substantial, although I expected a bit more spinach. Or feta. My boyfriend got the pulled beef with mushrooms, onions, and Dijon mustard. AMAZING. The crepe was stuffed with the beef and would satisfy any savoury tastebud out there.  So tip: don't get the one, or two ingredient crepes. Get everything your heart desires. Go hard or go home.   Also the crepes cost less than $10 and are really filling.   The savoury crepes don't look like anything special (even though they taste amazing), but the desserts are so cute! You get ice-cream and chocolate drizzle on your crepe which makes it a true dessert.   The server could be a bit more attentive, but you can tell she was trying! It was a full house with lots of people waiting, but smiling a bit always helps!   I would definitely come here with a bunch of friends again."}
{"text":"Best place in town for crepes & hot cocoa.  I was loyal to Wanda's waffles for years but since last year I've converted to Cafe Crepe!   The Nutella & banana crepes are perfect.  Not a big fan of it for sandwiches but definitely recommend them for deserts & hot drinks."}
{"text":"I've never really had good experiences with savory crepes in the US but apparently Canada knows how to do them.  Must be the French influence.  Good things:  lots of filling + moist.  I had the ham, cheese, and eggs crepe for $6.75 and would highly recommend it.  I was too full to try a sweet one but I saw their rows and rows of Nutella, and I'm sure it would've been good.  Next time Toronto, next time."}
{"text":"Good place for groups, as they handled 12-13 of us with relative efficiency and friendliness.  Menu is kind of tedious. Keeps repeating the same dish over and over again with slight ingredient modifications, almost like a Vietnamese restaurant menu, left me wondering WTF am I ordering. Menu choices were also dull, I was hoping to see some creative/inventive ingredient combinations for crepes, but I settled on \"ham, cheese and egg\".   Crepe was very tasty and quite cheap though, A-OK on tastiness and portion-size, but lacking in presentation."}
{"text":"On a business trip in Toronto, I had looked this place up knowing I wanted to try some crepes while I was in town.  I had to walk from my hotel to the corporate offices about a mile or so every morning and had originally decided to stop here for breakfast at some point.  Due to an error that my hotel made I ended up getting complimentary breakfast my entire stay at the hotel.  I was kinda bummed that I wouldn't get to try out the crepe place when someone reminded me \"Crepes aren't just for breakfast\".  So as I was wandering around the hotel, because it was too boring in my room, I remembered wanting to go to Cafe Crepe so I checked yelp on my iPad to find out they were still open.  I wandered in to see if they had any dessert crepes since it was about 9:30pm.  Sure enought they had quite a variety.  Since I can't stand hazelnut and am not a fan of Nutella, I simply wanted a chocolate styled crepe.  I was a little disappointed to find all they had was dark chocolate, so I went with the dark chocolate and strawberry.  What a perfect combination.    The crepe itself wasn't all that spectacular, in fact it was rather bland tasting.  But the dark chocolate filling and perfectly sliced strawberries were just right.  I will say there were toooo many strawberries and I did leave several of them on the plate, but I will most likely be back on my next trip to Toronto.  The place is rather small and very noisy, but everyone seemed to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Savory or sweet, Cafe Crepe is a great choice for crepes in the city. Just around the corner from my home, I visit here often with friends, and equally we order take out frequently. When I can't make up my mind, I go with a savory crepe and order a Nutella milkshake to satisfy my sweet tooth. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great little place to run in or sit down for some amazing crepes and coffee. I enjoyed a great ham and swiss crepe and some fresh lavazza coffee. You can sit at the bar or enjoy table service. Fast and very fresh. Loved it."}
{"text":"I'm used to eating crepes in Europe, not to sound elitist, but they are of similar quality and much cheaper. They're not expensive by Canadian breakfast standards here, however. I would definitely recommend this place for something out of the ordinary.  Really liked the dark chocolate and the coffee is good."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch and we stumbled upon Cafe Crepe. We didn't have to wait and there were many seats available as we came pretty late for lunch. The workers were very nice and friendly, and provided quick service. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be made. I ordered the chicken, swiss cheese, and mayonnaise crepe, which tasted amazing at first, but I soon got sick of the taste. There was too much mayonnaise inside the crepe, which eventually overpowered the taste of the chicken and cheese. Most of the crepes were overall pretty cheap in my opinion and the atmosphere was very soothing and homely. Cafe Crepe is more of a place to go with a small group of friends or even with just one other person."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday, after seeing an opera at the Four Seasons with my friend.  We skipped dinner as a result of already running late for the 7:30 performance. We got out starving! It was probably around midnight and the place was still very full! It had a nice cozy warm atmosphere, it was nice to be somewhere that felt so lively.  The menu is extensive- a lot of choices! My friend ordered a savory crepe with chicken, cheese, onions, and mushrooms which was really yummy from what I stole from her plate.  I, of course, ordered a sweet crepe: ice cream, caramel sauce, hazelnuts, strawberries, and bananas! HAHAHHA Yay sugar! It was really yummy! My only complaint was that the crepe itself had a slight taste to it when you ate it alone, like the oil used on the grill was slightly old or burned.  Specialty coffees are yum! Nutella latte is crazy sweet/rich/fattening.  I had the B-51: booze, coffee, and whipped cream.  How can you not love? Our server was nice and the food came out SUPER fast. I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe is a great place to just chill with a few friends over some coffee and dessert.  The illy coffee served there is amazing (like always).  I ordered myself a lemon and sugar crepe with a side of ice cream.  I was very content.  However, service wasn't the best.  The waitress that was serving us had a bit of attitude."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little space on Queen, this is my go-to place for crepes or a nice-evening-stroll-calls-for-a-walk-in-snack. I've introduced this place to almost all my friends and thanks to me, Cafe Crepe now has a stronger fanbase. Alright, deets time!  Ambience: Retro-contemporary. Gotta love those posters on the wall!  Service: Nothing to write home about, but it's not bad either.  Crowd: Hipsters, couples, friends... not a lot of people over 40.   Variety: Crepes and more! Wide variety of sweet and savoury treats.   Tip: Nutella Strawberry yumminess... or even the butter crepe. SWEET all the way! Do it!  Verdict? LOVE this place... totally going back, 100 times and over."}
{"text":"We came for dessert after dinner.  I like the old fashioned decor that is a cross between a Parisian cafe and a hip diner.  We ordered a banana and apple sauce crepe.  The combination was not on the menu, but they allowed it.  The crepe was \"mildly\" sweet.  Yes, there is such a thing.  The crepe itself was mild.  The banana was off season, so it wasn't ripen to sweet.  Hence, a delicately and mildly sweet crepe.  I wished it was sweeter, but we ordered what we ordered.  Our faults.  The coffee was good and rich.  Again, not too sweet.  Services was very good at ordering and serving.  The waitress asked us to close the bill, as it was near the end of her shift.  We were allowed to sit for quite a long time afterwards, even there was a line up outside.  Cool."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of food to go, but I can only eat so many hot dogs. Cafe Crepe is great because they'll wrap up your crepe in an easy to eat package.  I always go in with the intention of getting a savoury crepe, with something healthy like spinach in it. Oh but I never do! I can't make it past the Nutella, the fruity-spreads, the sugar! Oh. The. Sugar.   So.  I compromise most of the time and get the banana and sugar crepe, which is both sweet and full of potassium."}
{"text":"Not the place to go when you're in a rush. Somehow, everything we ordered took forever. Also not the place to order regular breakfast food. Just stick with crepes here, as I ordered the 3 egg any way breakfast and an additional crepe to split with my sister, but when our scramble came out it was at most 1 & a half eggs. The actual crepes however were very good.   Pro tip- sign outside says small coffee and a plain crepe (choice of cinnamon sugar, lemon sugar, honey, etc) for 5 dollars! Sounds like a great pre-work breakfast to me."}
{"text":"From the vibe to the desserts, I love this place.   The Nutella milkshake is a must. It's delicious! A little on the pricey side but it's a nice indulge once in a while. Their crepes are also nothing short of amazing. My friend has a peanut allergy so they were really great with recommendations and accommodating her.   They do get quite busy though, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Expect a bit of a wait for a table and your food. I speak only for myself but I think it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We found this place accidentally & loved it. My daughter & I split a panini & sugar cinnamon crepe with fresh strawberries. Both were delicious. She also loved Mocha Latte with almond butter. My husband enjoyed his chicken club on a baguette & my son had a chocolate crepe with lots of extra whipped cream. We loved this cozy place & their love of Nutella as art. Lol!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were trying to take shelter from the rain, when We found ourselves inside this place. We spent a lot more time than planned, catching up on old times in a very relaxed atmosphere, over lunch and a couple of espressos. I had the Panini sandwitch with BOCCONCINI cheese, olive oil, tomato, basil. It was great, I wished it was a little bigger. I must note that the espresso was devine. I will be back again for more when in the entertainment district! My friend had the Grilled chicken breast with swiss chese and said it was great. Prices are very reasonable, all things considered."}
{"text":"this is what i love about Canada. the amazing crepes! seriously... i was never really a fan until i tried crepes in Canada... not France. weird, right?   we came here for a 2nd stop of our dessert fiasco. the savory crepes are delicious... but my favorite is always the Nutella w/ Bananas. omg!!!! it never fails. trust me.   the service here is quick- but not hurried and sloppy. me likes."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in this city for almost 9 months and only just recently found out about this place. They have a large variety of sweet or savory crepes, but more importantly, they've got $4 martinis on Thursdays! I've gone the past couple Thursdays and have had a really good experience each time. I particularly like the chicken, egg, cheese, and mushroom crepe, and they make a good mai tai. My only minor complaint with the martinis is they're all pretty sweet, which gets to be a little too much after the second or third.  Be prepared to either get there super early or wait for a long time to get a table. This past week we got there at 4:50pm and the place was already packed!"}
{"text":"It is amongst the best desert places of Toronto. Its nutella and strawberry crepe is really mouth watering. I am not so into savoury crepes but i found their savoury crepes also very popular. The staff is great and its location on queen street is ideal for a late night hop up."}
{"text":"The place features a takeout front, and a dine in back, we chose the latter. Had some delicious and creative crepes! I ordered their new \"smores\" crepe and I nearly died. Fluffy crepe pastry lined with a thick juicy layer of Nutella, and stuffed to the brim with toasted marshmallows and crushed graham crackers. They had some other interesting ones, such as their cafe crepe special that featured hazelnuts and grand Marnier stuffing.   Didn't care much for the 80s smoking room design and wobbling tables. Lost one star because our food took a long time to arrive, as the kitchen was mostly busy on takeout orders."}
{"text":"I love this place. It reminded of the cafÃ©s in Paris. I really enjoyed my creamy caramel crepe with whipped cream.  It's a great place to meet with friends and you can enjoy a savory or sweet crepe, with a cappuccino or your favorite alcoholic drink. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe was a pleasant surprise for me to learn about. Suprising because tthe review scores weren't particularly high; but having said that, I thought the food was pretty good! We had a sweet crepe (nutella & strawberries) and savory crepe (tuna, egg & mayo). Even days after eating there, I'm still thinking about both crepes and craving more. That to me is a sign of a good experience!   We were lucky to have come in and got a table right a way. Minutes later, there was a little line up waiting for tables. I noticed  only a few reviews mentioned this, but it's something to keep in mind when trying to eat here."}
{"text":"Cool little creperie that I had some hankering for a different style of breakfast. So crepes it was. I did notice they had a window where you could see what they were making as you walk by. There is some I g about watching people make crepes which is pretty cool. It's kinda therapuedic. Seeing them use that little wooden rake in a circular motion on the round griddle. It's pretty neat!   Location is across from the Chum city building and it's a dark place inside. However who cares about this as long as they make good crepes. I did go with a serving of regular crepes and one serving of a breakfast crepe with bacon and cheese. Since I'm an early early bird when I was there it was not busy. Actually there was no one else present. My crepes were made quickly and efficiently. I took them back to my hotel and the family enjoyed them. Were they the best crepes I've had? No they weren't. However they were not the worst also. Somewhere in the middle of the road. Would I come back? For the price and selection sure why not!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed, but we got seated in good time. The menu is pretty straight forward with sweet and salty crepe offerings. These are crepe Suzette style crepes, not crepe Breton style crepes.   I ordered the strawberry and nutella and my friend ordered the strawberry, banana and nutella, with whipped cream (which 1$ extra). The crepes were surprisingly full of nutella all the way to the edges and they were hot when they came out. The service was friendly, albeit waaaaaaaaay understaffed, so super run off their feet and a little slow.   Overall, it feels like the chain it is, not amazing, but satisfying for a crepe craving."}
{"text":"As far as Crepe shops go, this one is worth stopping by at.  There's little food that's not overpriced in this part of town - so why not get a good fill from what you do spend your money on?  It's worth noting that you get the same crepe regardless of if you stand up, take out, or eat in.  And the 15% savings of taking out (due to not tipping your serve, due to not having a server) could be a make or break point here.  After a movie, or a ball game, Cafe Crepe can make a great meal before jumping the subway and heading home.  I recommend the cheese, chicken, and mayo.  It should be noted that their menu is confusing - I think on purpose.  Look at basic prices, and add on prices.  This may be a factor in how much you pay.  For example: A Strawberry Crepe with added bananas is cheaper than a Banana crepe with added strawberries (end result: The same.)"}
{"text":"Extensive selection of crepes and sandwiches. I think they need to update their menu, though, because I tried to order quite a few things that they told me they just didn't carry anymore, even though they were still on the menu.   They do their basic strawberry and nutella pretty well - although the crepes here are soft, and liable to get soggy if you' don't eat them fast enough. Definitely overpriced, as many things on Queen West tend to be. Came here to check it out, but if it wasn't for the prime location, I wouldn't have come in. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is based on my daughters to go crepe which was very good for a reasonably priced $8.50.  Had lots of fruit in it.  I watched them make the crepes.  They were very large and topped with a good amount of toppings.  The restaurant was fairly crowded."}
{"text":"Most favorite crepe cafe in Toronto. Yummy chocolate with strawberry and whipping cream.Maple syrup also good. Love this crepe's texture which is very soft and thick. Love this crepe dough."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years now. Off an on, of course. CrÃ©pes aren't an everyday food.  They are consistently good.  While the service can be a bit spotty, as others have noticed, I've never had horrendously bad service.  The crepes are quite good.  I have tried both the sweet and savoury and enjoyed both.    Now, the savoury choices are somewhat limited.  They know what side their crepe is buttered on, so to speak.  They seem a bit more geared toward breakfast, with ham, egg and cheese being among the more common fillings.  I do wish they had some more interesting choice here, but, let's be honest, most people like the sweeter offerings.  As for the sweet stuff, I'll admit a fondness for the Nutella crepes.  Either banana or strawberry make a good addition, so feel free to try.  They are quite good.  I've also tried the dark chocolate and enjoyed it.  It is not overly dark, so it won't bother those who prefer their chocolate a bit sweeter.    I rather like their coffee.  They serve Illy, which is a smooth and somewhat sweet Italian espresso.  While I generally like my espresso on the bolder side, Illy is really quite good.  It goes down fairly easily, even when simply taken as a single or double shot.  The lattes are very good.    The prices are a bit up there, but for a dessert place on Queen West, it's not horrific.  It is a nice treat on a night out.  If you're going there regularly, well, I hope you exercise a lot."}
{"text":"Was walking by with a friend when we were stopped in our tracks by the smell of delicious crepes. We decided to stop in for a bite. We both had an orangina along with a strawberry-banana-Nutella crepe. The crepe was well-made, the strawberries and banana fresh, and let's be honest, what's better than Nutella? Well, probably a few things, but you get the point. Overall, really solid crepe spot, but didn't stand out enough for more than 3 stars"}
{"text":"I've only been once but I yearn to go back!  I had a really lovely dessert crepe and the portion size is huge! It's definitely worth the money, fruit is fresh and taste is amazing.  I really enjoyed my drink as well, and had a great experience. The interior is fun, and very comfy, and it seems like a great place to be on a cold night.  Definitely plan on coming back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"*I think this place is still open until now because of the location, which make it essentially a tourist trap.  *The service was consistently ... bad and snooty servers. *Went here previously, got a sweet crepe with strawberry ice cream and once it arrived, the ice cream melted already! Thus I inquired the waitress and she told me that's how the ice cream is supposed to be... Lol. *The decor reminded me of a diner in the 50's, instead of a Parisian creperie.  -Montreal smoked beef, dijon mustard Savoury Crepe - $6.35 The crepe itself was way too thick and soggy at the same time, and the inside was burnt. They pretty much filled half of the crepe with the smoked beef and there was too much dijon mustard so the spiciness overpowered the natural flavor of the beef.  -Traditional french baguette sandwiches (Prosciutto, bocconcini cheese, tomato, basil, olive oil) - $7.75 The baguette was hard and \"lightly\" (I barely tasted it) drizzled with some olive oil. Bocconcini cheese is essentially egg-sized semi-soft mozzarella cheese and since the flavor is really mild, it needed a lot of \"help\" to bring out the flavor. The sandwich was tasteless and I could tell the cheese was definitely not fresh as the texture was so hard that I can probably slap someone with it"}
{"text":"Savoury crepes are wheat flour, not the traditional French buckwheat. Therefore not gluten-free. Why bother?"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.    I came here with my sister on a late Thursday night around 10:30. Thank goodness we didn't have to wait 30 minutes just to be seated.  It was pretty much a full house because all the other seats were occupied.  A couple next to us decided they weren't going to spend the rest of their anniversary in a busy, loud location so they left.   At first, my sister and I didn't notice. We got our drink orders taken, followed by a prompt \"hurry up and order your bloody crepe\" tone of \"are you ready to order.\"   We didn't even look at the menu for 5 minutes.   As my sister and I started chit chatting, we realized how loud the place is. I was literally right beside my sister screaming trying to get a word in. A huge group of 20 young adults seated at the back literally made it impossible for any conversation to happen.  The waiters weren't saying or doing anything about the noise. We Couldn't even here the music. And as much as the noise is out of the waiters hands, they could have asked the guests to keep it down a little. It's an establishment that's not established.   My sister was getting a migraine since loud noises aren't her thing. We shoved the crepes down our throats and left.  Their crepes are again mediocre at best. It just has a crap load of Nutella and everyone loves Nutella.   If I ever go again, it'll most likely be for go. I'd never wanna sit there and be rushed by servers or have my ear drums burst."}
{"text":"I was immediately attracted to this place as soon as we stepped in. The aroma was to die for.   I ordered the Nutella crepe. Yes plain and simple as is, topped with a scoop of chocolate ice cream. You can never have enough chocolate! It was very nice and filling.   Service was great. Our waitress Theresa was very kind and smiley. We were served fairly quickly as well & the cafe was very busy."}
{"text":"Meal crepes are the hoity-toity versions of breakfast burritos and that's just fine.  I prefer tortillas but that's not available on this part of Queen St. and crepes will do just fine. Dessert crepes are glorified pancakes but not as hearty or healthy.  Not sure why crepes exist except as a historical novelty actually.  Anyway I had a decent experience here overall.  The food was not particularly good, and at a price point beyond the quality received, but the service was nice for me and the environment was pleasant.  I'll almost certainly come here again and I'll expect it to be not that good and overprices, but looking up and down the block I don't see many better \"I just want to be full\" options."}
{"text":"Really great food and lattes with excellent, friendly service. Breakfast crepes were heavenly."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend after dinner as we wanted some dessert before heading back to uptown. It was not busy on Tuesday night, many tables were empty, but we actually waited for 5 mins to get a table. Around 20 mins, our crepes came out together and one of them was COLD. The crepe is just crepe, nothing special. Definitely not a dessert place I would go again."}
{"text":"??????????????????????? ??????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Je l'aime les crepes.  Simple as that.  If I had the talent to make them, I would eat them every morning, noon, and night (plus also as snacks in between)!   Cafe Crepe's crepes are kinda over priced, but that doesn't stop me. Sometimes it is busy so I just grab a crepe to-go. Leaving with no crepe is out the question.  Perhaps I should just improve these horrible crepe making skills of mine so that I can... a) save money and b) really can eat them every morning noon and night + snacks"}
{"text":"VIBE  This is across from the Much Music building so during the day, it's the meeting spot for the \"youth\" (16-21).  You'll see as many people waiting inside at the front counter for their crepes as you will inside. That said, you never feel rushed here. I like the take out window and walking by to see the guys make the crepes. It definitely adds a bit of character to the corner of Queen and John.   I EAT/DRINK Their hot chocolate is one of my favourites in the city. A must! I used to work in the area so it was always the ham and swiss cheese crepe that was my usual. I love that the cheese oozes out of the crepe (also well made and shaped). That said, I'm also a huge fan of the nutella/strawberry combo. They slather it on. Well worth the indulgence!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Don't give a crepe about the other mediocre food in the area. This is a lovely spot to hang if there's room or grab and go a snack (service is pretty speedy as well).  I like this as a good breakfast pick-me-up as well.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I come to this place each time I'm downtown. The staff is very sweet and give you your space; similar to how crepe CafÃ¨s are in Europe. I can't give it five star, because the temperature of my food is inconsistent each time. Sometimes the crepes are spot on, other times like tonight my soup was cold, along with my Crepe (and it wasn't busy at all). I will say the waitress and cooks felt bad when I politely made a comment to turn the soup stove temperature up, and took it off my bill. I'll be back for a third times a charm."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Great sweet crepes, coffee, seating and service. Haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"It's places like these when I wish I had more money and a better metabolism, cus I would come here all the time.  Coming here was a last minute decision and was partly decided upon because of the cold cold winds from this past brutal winter (it's finally over right?). I ordered the dark chocolate and banana crepe, and he grabbed himself the brown sugar crepe.   It was delicious! So delicious! Like, I-ate-it-too-fast-and-felt-sick-for-the-next-30-mins delicious. The crepe was prepared in a good amount of time and had good quality dark chocolate. My crepe was also paired with a nice tea. Although I think using proper loose-leaf tea would be a better fit for the atmosphere and overall quality of the meal.  But I think the defining part of my experience was the great service. We weren't the easiest customers to deal with (we were distracted by work/serious issues) and weren't ready to order on multiple occassions. She was continuously friendly and understanding. She was also quite funny and kind, so she really helped create a great experience."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh. This place is addicting.  I went up to Toronto two weeks ago to visit my best friend.  After eating Korean BBQ for dinner, we decided we wanted dessert. Someone suggested Cafe Crepe. I think, \"sure, why not.\"  (Being from Maryland, there are no creperies around me.  The only place that sells them is iHop... which is lame).  I look at the menu and am surprised at the number of different crepes to choose from!  Are you kidding me?!   I choose the nutella and almond crepe.  For the price, I assumed it would be fairly small.  NOPE! The thing was ginormo!  And oh, so delicious.  I've been thinking about it ever since.  I'm going back to Toronto next month... so you know where I'll be!"}
{"text":"I love crepes. I had two crepes for breakfast on the day we were leaving Canada. My first crepe has tuna (good) and the second was nutella and banana. I really like the combination of nutella and any fruits so you really can't go wrong there. My best friend and I also grabbed some crepes the night before during our bars hopping adventure. Crepes make such good midnight snacks. This place was convenient to the hotel we stayed at so that was a huge plus. Overall, I really liked Cafe Crepe."}
{"text":"Brunch 7/2/16 with my son -- he had an omelet (in a creperie??) while I had a crepe with maple. Okay, so I'm a typical American having something with maple syrup in Canada.   In any case, we each sampled the other's, so I can say both were delicious.  Good service, but we came before the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Crepes are pre-made and reheated when you purchase. They are also quite expensive."}
{"text":"My friend took me here the first night I was in Toronto. It was a cute little spot and great for a romantic date also. The crepes were delicious and so was the cappuccino!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised at how high the reviews are; it wasn't too great an experience for me. I went at around 9 pm on a Friday night, and the place was pretty full. The wait for a table was only about 5 min, but it took what felt like a lifetime for the waitress to come and take our order--she was not busy, just chatting with coworkers. It was another 40 min before she arrived with our crepes. By that time, about half the customers had already left and our crepes were unpleasantly cold. One of them, an ice cream crepe, was fully melted. The crepes themselves were average, not the quality I was expecting. All in all, I would say the service is rather poor and the crepes were average.   You'd be better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am just not into crepes (i know I'm such a freak), so I ordered the five cheese panini on french baguette.....OMG, so freakin good!!! I have never enjoyed the combination of bread and cheese this much, oh and throw in a tomato to make it even better. It was like the ironman of grilled cheeses.   I also got the iced cappacino and it was soooooo tasty. The only problem was that it could have been blended a little better, but taste wise, A+.  I ordered to go, so can't speak for the dining experience, but service at the counter was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Solid 3. Good service and great location. We came for brunch around 11am. Good cappuccino and americano at a reasonable price. Love how hot they were served. Crepes themselves were just ok. We got a banana/nutella and a savory with caramelized onions, feta, and spinach. Both were slightly soggy and forgettable."}
{"text":"Good place for a light lunch or dinner with a wide variety of both sweet and savoury crepes. Fast service + fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The place itself is cute and the smell as you walk in is dope.  But that's about the best I can say for it.  Our server was nice enough especially at first, but I really felt at the end, she was rushing us out the door.  Yes the place was busy, but not busy enough to have her bring the cheque while we are clearly still finishing our drinks and right in the middle of a good conversation.  Then to kind of hover around pressuring our career, not so good.  My other beef was the food itself.  We got the spinach and feta crepe.  There as no love in this crepe.  The presentation couldn't be more boring and the filling was dry.  I really think they could have added something, maybe sauce, maybe a side... something to break up the visual monotony and add some flavor!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place smelled amazing from the street we had to walk in. Really spacious. Good service."}
{"text":"Want an authentic sweet crÃªpe just like you have in the streets of Paris? Look no further than Queen Street in Toronto!  I wanted to have an authentic Parisian crÃªpe, so I ordered the plain Nutella.  All you Yelpers convinced me to try strawberries (or bananas) so I ordered strawberries on the side.  My theory being it would keep the crÃªpe from getting water down by the fruit.  It did & allowed me to have the authentic experience.    And for the sociability of the waitstaff? They're working, leave 'em alone! Ha ha. They did make a crepe for me (when they didn't have to) so I could get a picture through the outside window. They might not be chatty, but they sure are nice!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for a quick dinner before the movies and it was the right choice! I had a mint mocha and the chicken, swiss cheese, egg, and mayonnaise crepe while my friend had a hot chocolate and nutella, banana, fresh strawberry crepe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was top-notch as well."}
{"text":"Fun to see the chefs make the crepes and a good place for a quick desert. But, nothing really stands out. Price to portions are definitely better than Crepes A Go Go, but I find the quality is sometimes lacking."}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe rarely let me down.   However, here's one thing that has been bothered me for a long time about their ice cream crÃªpe: You can order \"3-scoops-ice-cream crÃªpe\" with ice cream stuffed inside, but not for the other orders. I.e., if you wanted to make your own crÃªpe, you can only order the ice cream aside rather than stuffed in the crÃªpe. This has been bothered me for a long time, because I only like it when the ice cream is in my crÃªpe."}
{"text":"I would have thought that there would have been more crepe places in the core of Toronto, but I could not come across any others. This place seems to be a trendy place for small groups of people to congregate while eating some fine crepes. You can see the crepes being made from the street via their front room kitchen and large window looking in. They serve both dinner and desert crepes, as well as specialty coffee's and alcohol. I find their crepes to be good, as there is quite a large selection of things that they can put inside the crepe. I have only had desert crepes, and you can fill them with fruits, maple syrup, chocolate, rum apple sauce and caramel to name a few of the toppings.  I cannot comment on the price as I have no experience at other creperies. I do, however, find their service to be good and the food comes out fast. Even when the place is full, our waiter came back to our table to check on things and the food was prepared faster than I was expecting.  The only small drawback I have is that I would have thought the crepe itself would have had a little more sweetness to it. I found the crepe to be a little bland, so make sure you get enough toppings to make it tasty."}
{"text":"Our waitress was cute in a crazy hippy sort of way.  She was kind of aloof as well.  Drives me crazy.  Anyway, food wise the crepe is ok.  I am by no means a crepe expert but I do enjoy them from time to time and this place has very good ones.  My only thing with crepes is they don't fill me very much.  After I finished eating here, I walked across the street and bought a hot dog from the hot dog lady."}
{"text":"Started off wonderful, until we learned that our crepe was stuffed with a long hair. Had to leave immediately upon our discovery, gross!"}
{"text":"I love cafe crepe.  It's a Parisian style coffee shop. They have proper grilled panini sandwiches as well as savoury crepes and sweet crepes. The savoury crepes are fantastic and the sweet ones are even better. How does Nutella, hazelnut, grand marnier and banana sound? It's music to my ears. The decor is hip and prices are reasonable. You can also get the crepes at the takeout counter to go."}
{"text":"If I have friends visiting, I always try to introduce them to cafe crepe.  I've had many crepes in the city and this  is the place that best resembles the crepes I eat while in Paris.  The menu is diverse, focusing on both savory and sweet crepes rather than the typical nutella and (insert fruit).  The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere simple yet welcoming and the staff are attentive yet not intrusive!"}
{"text":"I walked by here at like 9 PM on a Monday night.  Damn you Cafe Crepe, fanning the delicious smells of crepes onto the street.  I wasn't even hungry but had to stop in.  The service was very friendly and helpful (I'm one of those people that asks a lot of questions about everything), and my nutella-strawberry-banana crepe came up quickly.  And it was bomb.  It was everything I wanted in a crepe.  No complaints here.  Just writing about it makes me want another one."}
{"text":"Now lemme tell ya why I'm a fan of this joint.  First - the Martinis with vodka, kaluha, creme de cocao, baileys in a glass lined with melted Nutella.  I was so inspired by this, that I huffed on down to the LCBO and purchased a hundred bucks of  ingredients for my homemade creations.  Although my glasses with nutella didn't look so pretty ... looked kinda gross actually ... but the taste (and homemade strength) was there . . . but I digress ...  The crepes were fantastic.  I went for bannana, almonds, nutella (vs choice of dark chocolate) ...   all of this along one of my favourite lil blocks in t.o.  Thanks for the Crepes . . . . the waistline can't afford to eat these too regularly . . . . but it is a must try."}
{"text":"We went at about 6:45 on a Tuesday night. We had tickets for an 8:00 show a few streets over but The place had maybe 4 other customers and crepes are fast to make so we thought we'd be okay. We were sat right away.  The decor tries to do a French cafe feel but it's a little too sparse to pull it off with only some over-sized cafe prints to break up the jarring blood red walls. The tables were very scratched and need refinishing. It looks like nothing has been done since the place opened.  There were speakers sunk into the ceiling blarring some really annoying music far too loud. They have been badly positioned so that instead of a blanket of sound over the entire area, the crap comes at you from specific points. Luckily we weren't right below the speakers. Again I found myself at a restaurant where the music was so loud you had to raise your voice to carry on a conversation, and the music chosen was far more about what the wait staff wanted to listen too than what diners wanted to hear while trying to enjoy a meal. In addition to this, every so often VERY loud appliances form the kitchen area would join into the din. It prompted me to remark \"I am in complete audio hell! This makes me want to run screaming from the room.\"  There seemed to be 3 people in the kitchen area up front but only one working the tables in the back. He was the one who sat us so he knew we were there but we still waited 15 minutes for our waiter to arrive and take our order. It always amazes me when wait staff aren't trained to take drink orders as soon as the patrons are seated and come back with the drinks to take the food orders. Knowing we should be at the theatre by 7:50 or so we ordered main and desert at the same time. We were told they only had one left of one of the items that we wanted (at 7:00 on a Tuesday night?). I quickly chose another item.  The drinks arrived (really, couldn't you have poured the can of pop into the glass and just brought the glass to me?) but the food took another 20 minutes. I know this isn't McDonald's, but when there's only 2 other couples in the room a hot dog and a sandwich should come pretty quickly. Instead, two couples who came for take out after we sat down (and for the last couple, after we ordered)were served first and left. When it did arrive, it wasn't impressive. They were both served on side plates with absolutely no garnish or creative plating what so ever. The panini was tiny, the filling very skimpy, and all in all - it didn't have much taste. The bread/roll it was served on was not fresh and hard as rock (harder than a crusty panini should be, that is). What was supposed to be a gourmet European version of a hot dog was pretty much what you'd get at a cinema except with some cheese melted on top. Not exciting.  Despite our having ordered desert crepes at the same time, they took another 10 minutes to arrive. When the food did arrive, neither were too fancy so I didn't understand this. 10 more minutes of blaring bad music that made my skin crawl and gave me a headache for this? Again, mine wasn't garnished or properly plated at all - just slapped down on a side plate. It was the chestnut paste crepe but I found the filling was gummy and nearly tasteless - not the rich creamy version I had had in other establishments. The other crepe was better - more taste and at least some whipped cream had been sprayed about. It was far too heavy on the liqueur that was in it and that destroyed the delicate tastes of the other ingredients, mind you.  It took another 10 minutes to get a bill. No one ever asked if we wanted more drinks, etc. We paid and made a run to the theatre.  All in all it was over priced for what it was, and the atmosphere was awful. I don't see any reason to go back. It keep s getting voted best place for crepes by the readers of Now magazine but I suspect that's because it's the only restaurant in what used to be the fun area of Queen Street West that focuses on Crepes. I'd bet most of those voting couldn't name 4 other places that sold savory and desert crepes."}
{"text":"You'll never go wrong with nutella crepes, its good as this were their best sellers. The place is cozy and nice for friends and family to catch up. Wide varieties on the menu from desserts, to savoury dishes to alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Had the dark chocolate crepe and the hot chocolate with nutella. Very delicious eats! As desserts, they were pretty good. The place was crowded, but we we're seated as soon as we arrived! The dark chocolate was sweet, but not too sweet like most. The hot chocolate tasted watered down and most of it was whipped cream on top that I had mixed in so that I could take a drink, however I liked that it wasn't too sweet. Very pleased with the service!"}
{"text":"The panini here is reminiscent of those in Paris. The crepes are outstanding as well. Couple this with cheap beer, cheap martinis, and a great atmosphere and you have my favorite place in Canada. There are also Vancouver locations that are equally good. If Mccain wins, this will give me two good reasons to move to Canada."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is either a Crepe or from Paris. A nice place nevertheless, like a modern diner. If you aren't looking for something sweet, try the \"Some like it hot\" crepe. It's spinach, feta cheese, eggs(I think) and Tobasco sauce. A very nice combo on a crepe.  Reasonable price. Most crepes are in the $5-$9 range."}
{"text":"Cafe Crepe's crepes are not bad... but the selections just did not make be go WOW, I want to try them all....  Yawning... the menu is just so Yawningly boring.. Do I want chicken/ham/tuna with cheese/egg/spinach?  or should I just skip my dinner and just have dessert instead... the sweet crepes are definitely much much much better!!  Chicken with Mayo (yawning) - winner of the most boring dinner food photos I ever took!! A glass of water will be a more interesting photo... - The chicken is a little on the dry side... no amount of mayo would have save it!  Dark Chocolate and Coconut Crepe with Vanilla Ice Cream  - I did not order that.. but of course Rafi N who was so fortunate to sit with me for the evening let me taste it.. and I took a HUGE bite out of it!!  - It was really good... I guess it always good when you are eating someone else food?  Cafe Crepes is really good if you come in a big group! Our waitress suggested that she is going to split our bills right off the bat! Awesome! I know how after a few drinks, I lost my ability to figure out my share...   I will definitely be back for some sweet crepes, especially since Cafe Crepes is opened till 1 AM on weekends! And next time, I going to order one all for myself!!"}
{"text":"Pretty ok crepes but service needs improvement. Waited half an hour for two crepes for takeout..."}
{"text":"Loving this place does not make me a tourist, I swear. I just love Nutella in my crepes.  Cafe Crepe ends up being a huuuugee tourist stop, partially because it's on Queen St, partially because it's across from the teenager's mecca, the Muchmusic building. Stay away from this place on any night where bands are playing outside for free. One time I was at this restaurant while a bunch of teenyboppers were outside screaming for Hedley. I can still hear the screams.  I digress. The crepes here are so so so so so good. You can get \"real\" food ones, like with spinach and feta in them, or dessert ones with Nutella and banana, and you will love life. I've had sandwiches here that were made fresh and deliciously on yummy baguette buns or panini, and their salads are decently priced and sized as well, with a good choice of toppings. DEFINITELY get a coffee or hot chocolate to go with your meal. On cold winter nights, it's the only way to go.  Service is prompt, staff is nice, food is delish. So the tourists are definitely onto something -- this place is a slice of Paris in Toronto."}
{"text":"Lovely crepe place and the waitress were so beautiful. Cappuccino was great as well as strawberry crepe"}
{"text":"Really great crepe place which is pretty much always busy. We had to wait for a bit on a Thursday evening, but the wait was shorter than expected. They have a large selection of crepes, both savoury and sweet, as well as drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). I believe there is definitely something for everyone here. Got the dark chocolate and coconut crepe, which was delicious. Portions are decently sized, no complaints there. Also it's affordable, with most crepes priced between $5-$9."}
{"text":"Strawberries make your crepe soggy, beware!  I would probably go for Nutella Banana next time."}
{"text":"Visited Cafe Crepe a couple of weeks ago and tried my best to approximate a chicken florentine crepe by adding chicken, mushrooms and sweet onion aioli to a spinach crepe.  (Chicken florentine crepe purists, you may cringe now at my lack of knowledge on what constitutes a chicken florentine crepe.)  I've actually tried a somewhat shoddily-assembled strawberry and nutella crepe back in the summer of 2011, well before I even opened a Yelp account, so my expectations were not that high.  This time around, though, the crepe was more carefully assembled (look, ma, no cracks!) and had a subtly crispy texture.  The chicken was decently seasoned and not too dry, the spinach and mushrooms are all right, and the sweet onion aioli was mainly more sweet than onion.  In conclusion, while there are other creperies that I'd like to visit, I don't mind heading to Cafe Crepe once in a while.  Probably not in the summer though... fruit fly season! X_X"}
{"text":"So I didn't get a stiff drink this time, but a few Stella Artoises were a great way to watch down my usual order: the chicken, egg, swiss and mayo crÃªpe (CESM). Delicious as usual.  I have to give them an extra point for handling our large and boisterous group with aplomb and grace. Even though we milled about for hours, they were super-accomodating and even managed to wrangle separate cheques for each of us. There was a gratuitity added but I think it was only 10%. Fair.  I can now proclaim this restaurant Good for Groups. And so it is done."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times and other than it's convenient location it doesn't really have much going for it.   The service is rushed. The food is very mediocre - it's not bad but it certainly isn't anything to rave about. We got the apple cinnamon crepe and the chocolate crepe and it doesn't have much in it at all. Mediocre at best in terms of taste.   The only reason this isn't a 2 star is because the setting of the restaurant is quite homey and comfortable with leather seats and plenty of space."}
{"text":"Came here twice while on a Toronto getaway in early April, and had a pleasant experience both times. The French toast crepe is delicious and definitely filling for breakfast. I also ordered freshly squeezed orange juice which arrived full of pulp and satisfaction.   The second time around I had a nutella latte, which was a little disappointing. I didn't taste nutella at all; I barely even tasted chocolate. The food was still good: this time the sweet crepe I ordered was full of strawberries, bananas, and nutella. None of the ingredients were in short supply and I was grateful for how full I felt afterward.  The atmosphere is very quiet and relaxed. It's not a good date location as it just feels like an in-and-out sort of shop. On both of my visits the place only reached about half capacity. Not overly impressive, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a while now. It has a great ambiance and is well suited for many occasions - whether it is a catch up with friends, first date, or late night snack.   During the evening rush hour, the joint can be quite crowded so be sure to come early.   Over the years, my favourites are still the crepes with fruit inside. The dark chocolate with strawberries and bananas will always be my favourite. I recently had the apple and cinnamon - it was tasty but I found myself eating my dough than toppings."}
{"text":"I've worked in the neighbourhood for five years now and despite my adoration for crepes (I grew up eating them nearly every day), I've never had any real desire to try this place, and now I know why.  My first (and last visit) about a year ago was wrought with order complications and misunderstandings, a long wait, snooty service, and finally: a botched crepe! I ordered a banana and nutella crepe and it was mediocre for a cost of $8 (!!) but by the time I got it I was too tired to argue.   I have since duplicated the crepe at home for 1/16th the price."}
{"text":"Service consistently checked up on us. The crepes were fantastic as always. Whenever we asked for more hot water for our teas it arrived in moments."}
{"text":"Great place to get crepes. Ice cream, fruit, chocolate, maple syrup, and more! They're open late too."}
{"text":"We were in the C N Tower, and the Lovely Wife decides she wants Crepes. I've been married long enough to know not to argue, and it sounds good. But instead of asking the Google Maps on my phone, my friend decides to just ask the elevator operator if she know of a good crepe place and she sends us here.  Not bad. Not amazing, but we had a good meal and it wasn't stupid crazy tourist expensive.  We all enjoyed our crepes and the service was friendly.  The down side was it was sort of noisy making it a bit hard to talk.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We went here after a big dinner for some desert. I have never sat in the restaurant before so this was a great first experience. They seated us in the middle and accommodated us when we had requested to be moved to something off to the side. Great recommendations from the menu and the crepes are unreal.   If you are looking for a great coffee and desert place you should check it out. It has a great sitting area in the back and will give you the sugar rush you are craving.   Love it"}
{"text":"The sight and smell of them making fresh crepes in their window is very alluring - if you walk by enough, it'll eventually wear you down.  Especially if there's a sign right beside it advertising s'mores crepes, with graham cracker crumbs, marshmallows, and your choice of nutella or dark chocolate (as if that even needs consideration - of course nutella is the way to go!).  I guess I'm cheap, but I find the price a little steep at $9.  Mind you, the s'mores crepe is the only reason I go to Cafe Crepe and it's the only thing I ever get.  As a dessert, which it is, $9 is kind of pricey.  If I were to have that as a proper meal - hedonistic though it'd be - I guess it wouldn't be too expensive.  But I digress.  The s'mores crepe is great.  I crave it every so often.  Especially since they grease their crepe griddles with butter, so the crepe is even richer-tasting.  But it's always nice and thin as well.  In fact, their s'mores crepe has gotten me through a few nights of industry exam-studying blues. If they torched the marshmallow before closing up the crepe, it would be OFF THE WALL.  I totally wish they would.  But as it is, it's very nice.  If/when the s'mores crepe is no longer available (because it seems to be a limited edition seasonal item), I will drift between here and Crepe de Licious at the Eaton Centre for my crepe-eating needs, because I think the pricing is about the same for my regular crepe fave (nutella, strawberries, and banana).  Will be back to confirm."}
{"text":"Girl time catching up over crepe and a hottie!! Wassup?!?"}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick snack along queen street west! They have the option to dine in or take out. Many options for crepes! Try their hot chocolate, made with Hershey chocolate syrup and steamed milk!"}
{"text":"While trying to find breakfast and also not freeze to death, we stopped in at Cafe Crepe for, well, crepes.  My crepe was good (I went for one of the veggie ones) and the atmosphere of the restaurant was fine. My girlfriend got I believe the French toast crepe and it was not quite as good - she didn't finish. Nutella hot chocolate is good, but all the chocolate was stuck on the bottom.  Not a bad place to stop, I recommend coming here if it's not too busy and you're in the mood for crepes!"}
{"text":"Sunday night around 8:30 still very busy. It is a very stylish little shop. Got sugar and butter crepe. Tasted really satisfying. Would come back to try other things."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on our trip to Toronto.  My husband and I each ordered a crepe and coffee.  The coffee was okay but nothing special.  The crepes were solidly good and very filling.  I had the Florentine crepe, which was good but had wayyyyyyyyyy too much cheese.  I ended up having to eat around some of the cheese.  My husband had the ham, swiss, and egg crepe and enjoyed it.  Prices were reasonable and the service was fine."}
{"text":"I came here twice during my visit to Toronto be because its location is so convenient, and my sister and I did not know where else to go.  The restaurant itself is cozy. The seats were pretty comfortable, and the ambience wasn't bad. It seems like a place that many teenagers would hang out at.  The food was okay, and the menu seemed simple. It was long, don't get me wrong, but everything seemed pretty much the same, just tweaked a little bit. The first time I came, I didn't have a sweet crÃªpe, which I really wish I would have gotten. However, I felt pressured to order right away, so I went with the Spinach, Feta, and Egg CrÃªpe. The first bite was great. It tasted pretty amazing, but the more I ate, the less tasty it became. I also ordered the CafÃ© CrÃªpe Signature Nutella Martini, which was made with Frangelico, Kahlua, Baileys, Nutella, and milk. I actually enjoyed it, even though I usually don't like chocolate and alcohol. I tried some of my sister's soup, which was a Thai inspired soup, and that was pretty delicious. It tasted kind of like Tom Yum soup, but creamier. I don't know what it was, but it was great.  The second time I ate here, I did get a sweet crÃªpe. I ordered the Nutella and Hazelnut and added Bananas. Our server asked if I wanted whipped cream or ice cream, so I went with the whipped cream, but that was kind of a mistake. I'm sure most people love it, but I didn't think they went well together. Again with this crÃªpe, it tasted awesome at first, but with each additional bite, it just got boring to me. I had to try so hard to finish it. My sister got a soup again, but this time is was a Mediterranean soup. Seriously, again, that soup was pretty amazing, but that shouldn't be the highlight of our meals, since this is CafÃ© CrÃªpe, after all..  Our first server was attentive for the most part. When we were seated, she seemed to hover, coming back several times before we were ready to order. That's why I felt pressured to order right away. She checked up on us a few times during our meal, but after we were finished, she didn't come back to ask us if we were ready for the check. This kind of bothered me a little but because I saw her just standing there. My cousin had to call her over to grab us the check. But then again, I'm not from Canada, so I don't know if this is how it works here, or if this is just how she was. Our second server was very nice, but did not give the impression of being fake. There was nothing wrong with her service, and she was so pleasant.   Overall, CafÃ© CrÃªpe is a cute place that I probably will come back to if I'm in the area. I hope by then, they'll improve on their crÃªpes and maybe have more of a selection!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice while on a weekend trip to Toronto! The crepes are so good - my favorite was the strawberry Nutella one. Felt like I was in France again!"}
