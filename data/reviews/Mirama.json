{"text":"Long time customer and have to say they improved on quality ,I noticed low star rating but they must be old reviews ,for the price they charge you really get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"Just ordered some takeout from there. Took the chicken with peanut butter sauce, teriyaki chicken, rice and the spring rolls.
Teriyaki chicken tasted nothing like teriyaki. Came in a bowl packed with brocoli and onions, which both taste like shit and you can tell they've been sitting around for a long time. Peanut butter chicken straight up looked nasty and tasted the same.  The rolls tasted like oil I took a bite and threw all out. All I can say is thank God we ordered 2 large rice because that's all we really ate... STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food on the planet. Extraordinarily awful, and it's been around for years. Who exactly is eating this garbage? Once I took out some Cantonese Fried Noodles and ended up throwing it in the garbage--where it belonged.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Is it possible to give zero stars? Spend your money at Fay Wong instead. Absolutely awful, noodles were soppy with slimy chicken, soo guy not crispy, egg rolls way too salty, general tao covered in jam like substance, hot and sour soup was slimy as well. I cannot remember a worse Chinese meal, strip mall in Plattsburgh has better quality. If you're in the csl ndg area order from Fay Wong or take a trip to Chinatown."}
