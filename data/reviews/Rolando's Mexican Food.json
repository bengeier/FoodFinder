{"text":"This place is so good been going here for years. They have the Best Horchatas. Their carne asada burritos, carne asada fries are so bomb and so is their green salsa."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and ordered the Rolando's breakfast burrito. Best breakfast burrito I had from any other mexican places around. Everything was cooked fresh. Bacon is cooked nice and crispy not like some of the other places where the bacon is fatty and undercooked. Green salsa is excellent can't go wrong. While I only been here for breakfast a few times I'm sure I'll be back for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"California burrito is my favorite and make sure you mix the red and green sauce... amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awsome! I eat here alot and hav never gotten sick. The people are very nice. They hav a great neighborhood vibe. I love this place, food here is great, I wud recomend anythn on the menu"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful customer service! Always my go-to Mexican joint, even better it's right by my house!!!"}
{"text":"Lady yelled at me because she had to repeat herself, sorry I don't speak Spanish. Other than that food was good."}
{"text":"The food is great, we live close by and we have gone here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything we have ordered has been very good and a great value.  Especially the breakfast burritos.  Service is good and they have your food ready pretty quick, which is impressive considering they always seem to be busy."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries are fantastic! There tacos a delicious as well. Staff is always polite. Been coming here for about a year and I will continue to. Probably my only complaint would be they only take cash which is sometimes inconvenient but it's not that big of a problem. Definitely check this place out if you want cheap but delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"well been going here for years,still go at least 2 or 3 times a month,my youngest son is in the army,and ever time he is in town the first place he wants to go is rolando's,and the last place he goes when leaving town is rolandos,always the same carne asada burrito,de carne asada tacos are great to,if and when you go here,and if you dont try it you lose,try something carne asada,and if you do not like it, i would have to say do not ever order carne asada any where because you just dont like carne asada ,yes it looks like a dump,but guess what they made the deans list the last two times they went there ch 5"}
{"text":"Food is good except the hair in my chimi. They have no red or green chili which is odd and my favorite.  I don't think they believed me that the hair came from my food and seemed reluctant to refund my money."}
{"text":"This is the spot for fast mexican food. Family owned, One of the originals in the valley. It has been here since I moved to Phoenix in 2000. My favorite is the breakfast burrito, simply potato, bacon, egg, and cheese. Don't forget to try the horchata!"}
{"text":"I come here to get breakfast burritos for my team and they love this place. I do wish it had a drive through, but they always help me out to my car when I have large (40+) orders. The team all love the Chorizo and Potato breakfast burrito (everyone asks for it) and the Carne Asada burrito. I'm a solid believer in Rolando's breakfast burrito. I really like the open kitchen with the wall of health grade As (reassurance is never a bad thing). They make everything as you order it, so it's fun to watch them crack a dozen eggs onto the grill at lightning speed. Also, the red salsa is top notch!"}
{"text":"I've been searching the valley for three years now to find some amazing mexican that tastes like home.  After Bisteces turned Cuban, I was certain Fiesta Burrito in South Scottsdale was the best the valley could do (still go there).  I was wrong.  This place is an old Taco Bell (+ 3pts right there), they take cash only, and you won't even need a lot of it!  The tacos are huge, the cheese is not cheddar, the green sauce is perfect, the carne asade doesn't have any suspicious chunks, and their beans are even amazing!  It's a hidden gem that hits the spot every time; if you're from California, you'll definitely appreciate it."}
{"text":"My food was covered in cheese! No flavor just salty and plain!"}
{"text":"Heard of Rolando's through Yelp and decided to try it because of the positive reviews. The food was amazing and at a reasonable price. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos I've ever had! I've been coming here so much that the staff already knows my order!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"Fast Food\" Mexican place to go to in Phoenix. The food is extremely well made and the prices are decent. The beans and rice are very good and I love their red and green sauce.  They used to be open 24 hours a day, a few years back, so I would go here really late at night, but now, I mostly go there for their \"bacon egg and cheese\" breakfast burrito and it is amazing!  This place is (in my opinion) is better then all of the \"berto\" chains around the valley."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food place near me. I always recommend to friends and family and they love it too. I always get rolled tacos or burrito. I love their rice and beans with cheese. It sucks that they don't have a drive thru for times when I don't feel like getting out the car lol but it's worth getting out the car for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered a dish taco ... It sucked the Sauce  they put in it was waterey  ranch I THINK ?? So I didn't eat it ..  I also ordered a carne asada taco with guacamole that was good but I had better. Meat was more a lite brown instead of that med brown I like or use to at  an authentic Mexican restaurant .. don't know if it was boild ?  I will be returning just not ordering same items ... This place use to be BOMB .. don't know what happened.. its still good .."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant. I have been eating there every week for the past seven weeks."}
{"text":"A quote from my 13 year old (who had the bean burrito): \"This is the best Mexican food I've had in my life. It is SO good!\"  I had the California asada burrito, and agree that it was amazing."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant is my absolute favorite place to eat Mexican food in the entire valley! The breakfast burritos simply cannot be beat, the carne asada is delicious, and the tacos are to die for. It is definitely worth the 30 minute drive for me to get to. Probably a good thing it isn't any closer though... I'd be there every day :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix! The burritos never disappoint, especially the breakfast house special."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff... no exactly real Mexican food, but they have huge portions of \"Mexican American\" fare."}
{"text":"Rolandos breakfast burrito, hot, made with fresh eggs and very tasty.  The potatoes were cooked(sounds weird but I have had burritos with hard uncooked chunks) the bacon crispy and it didn't have the usual puddle of drippins in the wrapper when done eating.  Definite go back"}
{"text":"Legit Mexican food that's consistently delicious and filling. Employees here work hard and are so pleasant to interact with. Love supporting the local businesses."}
{"text":"I recommend the adobada tacos. They are excellent   However, we have a recurring problem of the cashier ALWAYS charging too much.   Beware, but enjoy!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews here, I had to try this place!!! I have to say the food here is GREAT!!! I have to agree with all the reviews here as it being the best fast food mex. of any in the the valley!!! Friendly guys working there also!!!"}
{"text":"My carnitas burrito was good but when I got to the bottom half, it was full of oil. My boyfriend's Cali burrito had fries that weren't fully cooked. The only plus was that the burritos are big and the guacamole looked fresh and was good. We would only come back if we were really desperate."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are great.  Not cheap with the fixin's and the tortilla isn't all wet from the eggs 5 STARS  The chicken tacos are disgusting.  It tastes like awful chicken chow mein on a hard taco.  0 STARS"}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I was a bit concerned about grabbing lunch here.  The neighborhood is fine but the place is a bit rundown. But when you walk in the door the smell of fresh Mexican food draws you to the ordering window.  We had a Chicken burrito, a Carne Asada burrito and an Adobada (marinated pork) burrito.The Carne Asada and Adobada were terrific.  Just the right amount of everything.  The chicken burrito was a bit bland.  It was fine, but you might want to dump a lot of salsa on it to spice it up a bit.  The prices are more than reasonable.  Burritos go from $3.25 to $4.25.  Combinations are a few dollars more and the tacos are all under $3.  In case you miss the huge sign - it's cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"Consistent great quality and value.  Highly recommend the Rolondo's Burrito.  It's a breakfast burrito but it's great any time of the day.  Green sauce is really good."}
{"text":"It was 10:30pm and I have been here less than a week. As I'm wandering down roads with no direction, all I see is the usual fast food joints, but finally I eyed a hole in the wall and after two U-turns I made my way into the drive-thru via a narrow alleyway very similiar to a joint in Vegas that also had good Mexican fare. I ordered through the usual garbled audio system at the drive through and asked for double rice to replace my side of beans - no problem. The two beef tacos were really tasty - the taco shells were as crisp as possible, but did not break apart when you bit into the tender shredded beef that was inside. Simply adorned with cheese and lettuce, the green sauce took these tacos to a new level. It wasn't spicy, but had a great taste that kicked up the tacos flavor (jalapeno probably). Will be back for breakfast, but if your sick of the usual fast food, try to make your way here for some good real tacos."}
{"text":"It's delicious! I ordered a chicken bean and cheese burrito with veggies and I'm in love! The chicken is juicy and the burrito itself was well proportioned. I hope the rest of the menu is just as good, it seems like a good stop after working late shifts. I'm glad I found this spot."}
{"text":"1st  trip in. 5 rolled tacos for me and carne asada burrito for Daddy.  Everything perfect just like National City where daddy came from. Crunchyroll tacos with guacamole perfect. And Daddy was happy because he ate the whole burrito and no mystery meat sometimes he spits out and throws the burrito away not this time.  And the salsa verde was not too hot just right."}
{"text":"I cant put into words how good their breakfast burrito is. It is the best breakfast burrito i have ever had. I love how everything in it is pretty much cooked right in front of me too. I'm very health conscious and wont go to most fast food Mexican restaurants but this one i will never stop coming to. I love it. Everyone who works there is awesome and very nice. They get my food out perfectly every time and provide great customer service every time."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for quite sometime now and the food and service never disappoints. Everyone talks about the burritos but I would definitely recommend trying the fish tacos! The fish is so crispy and the tartar sauce on it is absolute perfection. I would definitely recommend this place and i do all the time. Try the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I was turned onto this place by a co-worker.  Being from southern california I had a hard time finding a decent Mexican food spot out here but when I did it was rolondos. The food is really delicious and always consistent.  The workers are very nice and the wait is not long at all. This is my go to spot! Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some good Mexican food"}
{"text":"Of the non-chain Mexican food places in my area, this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out. That's because it doesn't have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have, and because the small, somewhat run-down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area. But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare, the food here is good; not exactly fast food, as it took a while for me to get what I ordered, but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous 'Berto-type  restaurants of the Valley."}
{"text":"Didn't ask for guac in my burrito.... But thats okay, Who doesn't love free guacamole!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast! The food is crazy cheap and pretty good, the vibe is divey, the soft drinks are cold, and the red sauce is spicy, not sure about the green. The girl at the counter is a little bit ornery and will look at you like you're from Mars if you look güero but speak español, but don't let that stop you! She will smile if you smile first. =] No surprises here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. It's more in vein with those Filibertos/Rolbertos/Federico's places than an actual sit down restaurant (and there is nothing wrong with that).   Portions are pretty big. Tables are pretty small. I had the Horchata and the Carne Asada plate, and I left with no complaints. Would definitely come back for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Great small local authentic Mexican food joint! Average prices for this type of restaurant, great quality food. I go here so much the guys here know my order already :P Great for a quick lunch or dinner and good portion sizes. This place definitely gets me my Mexican fix :D"}
{"text":"Okay don't judge this book by the cover!!!  I decided to try this place based on the 5 star reviews.  What everyone says about the exterior is true.  Oh but the food!!!  I just got the beef taco combo.... it didn't disappoint.  This is not Taco Bell.  Real true authentic Mexican food.  While waiting for my order I saw several things I should of ordered vs. the tacos.  But that's for my next visit!  Fast friendly service.  I will be back & bring the office peeps with me."}
{"text":"What a find!  I absolutely love this place!  Don't be scared by the little shack of a building this restaurant is in, the food is some of the freshest, tastiest Mexican I've ever come across!  I highly recommend the carne asada burrito, which is jammed packed with meat and includes guacamole as standard.  It is more then ample in size, even for a hungry customer.  The Rolando's breakfast burrito is outstanding as well and is filled with thick cuts of bacon.  Make sure to get the green sauce to accompany the breakfast burrito or any item on the menu, it is a true gem of this establishment!  Spicier then most green salsas you'll get at these \"fast food\" Mexican restaurants and WAY better!  Other favorites include the fish tacos, beef taco, and carne asada quesadilla.  The quality of the food here is superior to that of any filbertos or los betos, even though it has the same type of feel.  The staff here churns out delicious food at an incredible pace, even at the busiest of times.  When I lived near Rolando's, I would come here 2-3 time a week for the exceptional value of this amazing food.  Now that I don't live in the area anymore, I find myself making excuses to drop by this special little place!"}
{"text":"In a land full of 'Bertos, it is so nice to find a Rolando's. Not sure when this place was established but I know it's been here for years. Always a great place to come and pick up their humongous breakfast burritos. For 5 to 7 dollars, you can get: ham and cheese, bean and eggs and cheese or steak and egg or bacon egg and cheese w/potatoes. And that's just for their breakfast burritos. It can easily feed two people. They have quite a selection for lunch and every day combo specials as well. I love supporting local and it's very easy to find the spot just north of Peoria Avenue on 35 th Ave, on the right side. Make sure you get some of that salsa verde to go. Green saaaawwcce!"}
{"text":"Really good and the prices are super reasonable. Ordered cheese enchiladas, rolled tacos and a beef chimichanga. This is one of those hole in the wall places that skimps on atmosphere but doubles down on the food quality."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight. I guess my expectations were set too high by all the reviews I read. I order cheese enchiladas and the cheese was NOT melted inside. I also ordered a bean burrito and the beans were very good. The guy taking orders was not very friendly at all."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The breakfast burritos are amazing and will get you through the day. The enchiladas are bomb especially with the shredded chicken and rice and beans on the side. Also it's at a very good price for the amount of food you get. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Jonathan W's post back from 08/12/2008.  I have eaten here 40 times over 8 years.  I work in the area, stop in for lunch, grab a breakfast burrito often.  The very best machaca burrito in Phx, hands down.  Great red salsa.  The place is an old  dive but mostly clean... the food is outstanding, steaming hot, always quick and a very good value!  Exactly what you'd expect from a perfect dive mom and pop Mexican food place!  Never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Kind of average   I visited Rolandos based on all of the positive yelp reviews. The service was very good however, I thought the food was just okay.  On this visit we had the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole.  The burrito was full of meat and was flavorful, but it just wasn't anything special. The tree rolled taco, once again were good but nothing special.   I will revisit soon and try other menu items, but this visit was just kind of average."}
{"text":"Yes!!!!! Rolando's is EXCELLENT. Carne asada is to die for and I have recently been on a fish taco binge. Really tasty mexican food but you wouldn't bring your mother here for a nice sit down lunch. If you are in the area (even if you are not in the area) and want some awesome messican food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I have eaten here plenty of times, but NEVER again! I go some menudo this morning and there was a napkin in it! I don't know if it was a clean or dirty napkin, but that's disgusting! Of course, the owner is on vacation and the manager isn't there. I make menudo and never has anything other than what's required has been in it! To add insult to injury, they accused me of putting the napkin in there."}
{"text":"We went there because it was 4 1/2 stars and were surprised at the appearance.  It is a small take out restaurant with a few tables.  We ordered two orders of Nachos and they were fabulous and as good as any Nachos we have had.  Expect very good food in a very modest take out restaurant with a couple of tables."}
{"text":"Love the carne asada fries here. Im from southern California and was scared to try the mexican food here but it is great here!!! Love the food here and nice people."}
{"text":"Excellent food at an affordable price. Flew in to Phoenix for a quick trip and found this place on Yelp with 4.5 stars so we thought we'd give it a try. Rolando's did not disappoint! I had the carne asada fries which were delicious. Crispy, fresh fries with delicious carne asada, guac, sour cream, and cheese. In hindsight I wish I would have tried a combo plate, but the fries were great nonetheless. Husband had the cheese enchilada and beef burrito combo plate. He hoovered that bad boy up! Plate was completely clean by the time he was done. He said it was \"pretty darn good.\" Great food and great value. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito of all these types of restaurants.  And pico de gallo is free and delicious!     Always consistent, have been going for years and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look too affording but the food is actually really good. My boyfriend loves Mexican food and often goes to Rolando's for his carne asada burritos. Definitely recommend of your looking for great, fast, and affordable meal."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food spot in Arizona. Been going here since high school and it never disappoints. So good it'll make you slap your momma"}
{"text":"Never tried the food because the cashier was a jerk.   I walked up, looked him in the eye and said hello.  He just glared at me.   I ordered 2 breakfast burritos,  one ham and one steak.   He ordered two ham.  I looked at him again and he was glaring at me again, I started to repeat my order, but by this time I am not happy.  I was very irritated and I walked out so I could take a deep breath and go somewhere else.   I don't need frustration when I'm ordering lunch.  Being nice to new customers is important.  Smile."}
{"text":"I got the carne asada taco combo, the thing is MASSIVE!!!!! I was so full off of it. I got red salsa sauce (amazingly spicy). Service was good. Not sure why people said the lady was mean/grumpy. She looked mean but is really nice. Food quality is amazing. We came around 930pm, lots of free parking and restaurant wasn't overly crowded."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place for years but was finally taken by a friend who claimed this as her favourite. Dingy with a CASH ONLY! sign seems kind of dodgy but it's kept up to standards and passes all the food inspections, so don't let the oldness of it scare you away. I ordered a quesadilla, 1/2 pint of rice, and three rolled tacos and all were fresh, hot, and delicious. The quesadilla was also bigger than your average tortilla so that's a bonus. Everything totaled to around $6 which is a bit more than your average Taco Bell but a lot better tasting - you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"4 days I was in Arizona for spring training and I stopped at Rolando's 5 times. Best authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten. I'll probably visit AZ again just to get some more food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos & hot sauce in all of az. Crispy bacon! I live 10 miles away and go here at leat once a week for the Rolando's burrito."}
{"text":"quick, clean, fast   good value which gets the basics right  and beats out the place on 43rd / Cactus handily both in speed and taste.  The beans and rice aren't just required filler they're actually good accompaniments to the meal.   No frills,cash only and  not the easiest place to get in and out off ( then again neither is the new In and Out on Cactus)"}
{"text":"Big fan of Rolando's Mexican Food. I grew up around these neighborhoods until my parents moved. Anyways, this was a place that my friends and I would always go to. My parents would also buy us breakfast burritos or one of their various dinner meals.   My breakfast burrito of choice is a bacon egg, and cheese. I load up on their red and green salse (which has a bite to it) and I am in heaven.   For dinner, I usually stick with the cheese enchilada rice and beans.  Now that I don't live around this place anymore, I have to go to another place and I personally don't think it is the same. There is something different about this place that I just love. Highly recommended if you are a looking for a fast food type mexican food restraurant around these parts."}
{"text":"Place has good workers very friendly n quick . I went for breakfast n got a burrito ...it was a massive one but  it was good."}
{"text":"Rolando's rules! It was open at 10:30pm when we'd had a horrific travel day and just wanted to grub on some real Mexican food after always suffering through Seattle \"Mexican food.\" I think I angered and/or confused them by asking for a bean taco instead of beef, but they hooked me up. The cheese enchilada, rice and beans were all bomb, too. I liked their various salsas, and my companions enjoyed their food. Everything was cheap AF and authentic tasting. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"this place was an old taco bell joint, and there isnt a drive thru so IDK what the guy below me is talking about. But this place is the best place ive gone to, and believe me, ive lived in Phx my whole life and have gone to almost every bertos, hole in the wall mexican food place and Rolandos is the bomb!! Prices are cheaper than the bertos and cooked wonderfully. Its is definately run down but their food makes up for it all. Also, my husband and i just went there and they are accepting credit cards now!!!!! and looks like they did some cleaning/remodeling."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend saw the good reviews and we decided to try, once we got there we were a little hesitant because we didn't expect a little hole in the wall with  only 2 customers, regardless we went in and ordered our food it was ready in no time. We took it back to the hotel and let me tell you it was sooo good big portions and delicious food for a good price ... deft coming back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I love rolando's it's better than all the berto's burritos.  I've been going here for years. Wish they were 24 hours again. A drive through would be amazing!! It's worth coming in though. Also they charge .60 if it pay with a card. The green sauce and horchata are the best here"}
{"text":"Horchata. Horchata. Horchata. Love it. Plus it goes well with any meal you get at Rollies (nicknamed it that when we were in high school 10 years ago).  Bean and cheese burritos for the classic. Add the green sauce, you won't be disappointed. If you're starting early and want a quick but still authentic mexican breakfast you can count on Rolando's. The breakfast burritos are always on point...I mean cops even come to get them!  They used to be open 24hrs but that changed to closing at midnight but still opening around 6am.   If you haven't been it's a must!"}
{"text":"My go to late night Mexican food craving spot . Reasonably priced and filling. Now open 24 hours!!! the cheese enchiladas combo had me at hello You won't be disappointed. Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The place looks terrible from the outside but don't let that fool you! I've been coming here for years and they never cease to amaze me with their dedication to consistently excellent Mexican food. Breakfast burritos are served with amazing flavors and textures, fresh eggs, never homogenized eggs. Tortillas are always nice and fresh, like homemade.   Whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner the quality of their products are always on point! Excluding this review, I have never given a five star review to a restaurant. However, I can say with confidence that if you come here anytime of the day you won't be let down.   Their Carne Asada burrito is freaking fantastic as well. The meat is nice and juicy and never chewy. I get it with the guacamole, cheese, and pico de gallo. Green and red sauces are wonderful as well. Try anything on the menu I'm sure you'll love it!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for a quick lunch after a funeral at St Jeromes and found this place on Yelp.  I had the #11 (shredded beef taco, machaca burro, rice and beans) and it was great.  The guy at the counter was not the friendliest dude I have ever met but the food was very good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Still great.  Bought the Rolando's special breakfast burrito this morning.  Asked him to cut it in half.  I ate the first half with their homemade green sauce for breakfast and will eat the second half for dinner.  It's that big for $5."}
{"text":"Out of all of the 'bertos and 'andos in the valley, Rolando's is easily my favorite. It is exactly what you expect from the cheap, greasy Mexican joint down the street. The food is fast, hot, cheap, delicious and horrible for you.   The building leaves something to be desired, they don't take anything but cash and the bathrooms....wow, but the food more than makes up for it. In particular I recommend the Super Nachos or the Potatoes Bacon Egg & Cheese burrito, both doused in red sauce. Unfortunately they close at midnight now, but I've left the bar early just to get here. It's that good."}
{"text":"An absolute neighborhood favorite of everyone within a 10 mile radius! For those few people who call it \"average\" Taco Bell is not actually Mexican food. Best service in town, in 15 years they have never messed up my order and anyone who knows me knows I'm as picky as they come! Try the carne asada frys with some enchilada sauce. Lol they will think it's for me"}
{"text":"Probably not going to be my favorite to eat. Ordered a chicken burrito. Shredded chicken kind of dry. No other ingredients in the burrito. Just tortilla wrapped around a pile of shedded chicken. Picked up the burrito and drained the water out. No flavor."}
{"text":"Always bomb, they cook it fresh right when you order it I love my food hot and it's flavorful"}
{"text":"Rolando's is my JAM! I love this place always open at the right time. I work overnight, so they have my dinner and sometimes my breakfast too!  The staff is great and very efficient. They chop all their own veggies and meat and it's fun to watch them.   They are a terrific!"}
{"text":"The place is too expensive. Food is alacarte.  Not worth it, not a great variety, & bland.  Bathrooms allow guys in with women.  Not a place for kids"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious my favorite is the breakfast burrito and the carne asada fries. I love the green salsa!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a hole in the wall! Deff coming back next time I'm in Arizona. Ordered the Carne asada tacos and they are huge!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, it's just like any other Filibertos in the area. The cashier was friendly and the food was average."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was 13. My go to is the Rolandos breakfast burrito. You just simply can't beat it!!! Hands down best breakfast burrito in town! Their hours are very convenient and parking is very accessible. Everything else on their menu is amazing too. The staff is always friendly and the vibe is always relaxed and fun inside. Go get you a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Waited all day for Carne Asada Chimichanga and was not disappointed. Love there Carne Asada"}
{"text":"My very good friends from Phoenix were nice enough to take me here when I visited earlier this year.  They had been coming here for years and had absolutely swore by its food superiority in comparison to any of of their San Diego and LA rivals.  I ordered the carne asada fries and received a huge pile of fries topped with guac, carne asada, sour cream, and cheese.  I added a healthy dose of hot sauce, and it was deliciousness on a plate.  I also had a nice giant iced horchata to wash it all down.  Sadly, I couldn't finish the giant plate and took the rest home.  The meal was awesome and memorable, and I can't wait t go back."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burritos in town. Always quick and delicious. If you don't mind a dive (try to never use the restrooms here), the food is great and cheap."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and have never once been served bad food, or had bad service. My personal love is the Rolando's breakfast burrito, a log of deliciousness that can easily serve as two meals! Everything on the menu is delicious, from the carne asada to the chorizo, but definitely get the breakfast burrito, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Solid cheap no frills Mexican. Carne asada burrito is basically all meat. Fairly tender and juicy meat."}
{"text":"Rolando's occupies a former Taco Bell carcass and has been here for ten years.   Why have I been missing this place?  I'm not afraid of dingy booths and a CASH ONLY sign! They may look like one of your typical indie mexican fast foods with the big white menu board with red and green letters, but they really served up some delicious food when I stopped in for some takeout this weekend. Two friendly dudes were running the show, and one of them was even wearing a chef's coat.  I thought it was silly at first, but not after tasting the cuisine they plated up in styrofoam showcase boxes. Shredded chicken tacos, even with a fried, hard shell, were not the least bit greasy, and even though they fell apart while eating them I was able to fork up every single bit of the remains without dodging any greasy or fatty bits (NO DISCARD PILE!).    The same applied to soft corn shell carne asada tacos, with fresh made guacamole and tomatoey-onioney-cilantroey pico de gallo.   I didn't have the beans, but even they didn't look greasy at all, and the rice was fluffy and light, if a bit on the bland side. The 'green' sauce was absolutely yummy, with enough spiciness but flavorful heat, not show-off heat. Rolando's having a guy in a chef's coat is no joke; this is mexican fast food at its finest and for cheap, too!  Spending less than $14 on two full combos meant plenty left over for some Stone IPA to wash it down."}
{"text":"Really good food, extremely tasty. Their burritos aren't swimming in water/oil like some other places. Probably the best Mexican food I've had in the Valley. They close at 12am daily."}
{"text":"They know it. I will never eat Mexican food anywhere else in AZ. I dreamt about their food while at basic training. All the burritos, the chimi. They know my voice when I call."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I'm from Chicago and it's really easy to find tiny, greasy Mexican joints.  I'm glad I picked this place out of the few that I saw in this area.  Really good guys working behind the counter, sadly I never learned if one of them was Rolando.   The torta is on the menu, but they didn't have a picture on the board.  That's just me being a crazy person.  Whereas, almost every other item had a picture.  But I asked the guys how large torta was and the chef ?held up the bread they use, and it was a large size bolillo bread.  The torta was really good.   Definitely go for the orange colored hot sauce.  It has a really unique flavor and the color alone, I feel is unique. I'm used to a darker red sauce.  Most of the little places I go like this they give chips and salsa if you dine-in, but that is where this place lost one star.    Yes, I could've ask for chips, but I am grading off a personal standard.  PS I love limes, but they only had lemons ."}
{"text":"The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is the fact that it's pretty run down.  Apart from that, the food is consistently amazing and the staff is super friendly.  I go here for lunch probably more often than I should, but the food's so fresh I can't help it.  My favorites so far are the Chicken Enchiladas and the Tacos Adobadas.  The latter are downright revelatory!  The Beef Burrito's really good too, though!    I'm not even close to finished trying everything here, but I aim to try it all.  I've yet to introduce a friend or coworker to this place who hasn't loved it."}
{"text":"My only regret is not trying them sooner.  They are not open 24 hrs, but I think that's how they stay great.  You see them doing a thorough job cleaning the kitchen when you come in before closing.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, these guys don't f around with their consistency, unlike all the other similar joints nearby.   Breakfast burrito, Carne asada burrito, super nachos, bean cheese and rice burrito... I want to try other things, but my usual selections always leave me satisfied.  Also, green sauce - get it.  Edit - they are now open 24 hrs.  Still bomb af"}
{"text":"/TL;DR  Hole-in-the-wall is the best way to describe it. You know how that goes... shabby experience, ultimate food.  /ATMOSPHERE  It looks like a remodeled Hardee's or something. There's an overwhelming menu above and complete view of the kitchen behind the bar. Seats look like they came out of a rundown diner.  /FOOD  This is what the southwest is about. I had a breakfast burrito -- which was large enough as two complete meals, literally. The potatoes, cheese, bacon... everything in the right balance. The counter has a variety of salsa and sauces to spice it up.  /SERVICE  Order at the counter; pick up at the counter.  HOW TO READ MY REVIEWS: 1 Star - Does not approach edible. Enter at your own risk. 2 Stars - If I'm in the area, I'd pick something else. 3 Stars - I would stop by if I happen to be in the area. 4 Stars - I would pick this place out of other places nearby. 5 Stars - I would go out of my way to dine here."}
