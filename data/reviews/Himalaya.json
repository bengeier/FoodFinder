{"text":"Excellent plats, bon rapport qualité prix , mais manque de choix au niveau des desserts"}
{"text":"Beau petit restaurant indien avec un menu simple mais diversifié.  J'ai pris un combo pour 2, que le propriétaire a accepté de faire pour 1 personne pour environ la moitié du prix.  Bonnes portions et diversifiées.  J'étais surpris de voir que ce n'était vraiment pas épicé, même un peu sucré.  Très tranquille en ce mercredi soir, mais beaucoup de gens viennent chercher de gros sacs pour emporter.  À essayer si vous êtes dans le coin !"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem a few weeks back in the south shore and was wanting to try it out for ages. We aren't blessed with many indian cuisine options here in the South Shore so when an Indian resto opens, we cannot wait to try it out to see if we have something authentic close to home. This one opened about 5 months ago and already had some good reviews online so I was eager to check it out!  We went with a couple of friends on a cold night hoping to leave with our stomachs full. The interior is homely but quite basic... It was also quite cold inside the resto so we asked to sit by the heater which they kindly put on high for us.  We ordered the combo meals (great deal and lots of variety) which came with a mixture of starters (onion bhajis, samosa, kababs and popadoms) and butter chicken, lamb dopiaza and a shrimp curry with pilau rice. It also came with a gulab jaman for dessert - this combo was for two people btw! I found the curries quite mild and on the sweeter side - especially the butter chicken. I like my butter chicken and curries spicy but I suppose this has to be asked beforehand and also there are a few different techniques of preparing the curries. There is definitely a lot to choose from but I found the portion sizes a lot smaller than most indian restaurants I have been to (or maybe we were very hungry that day?!)  The restaurant is definitely very authentic and family run... The owner is extremely friendly and hospitable and meets his customers requests. I did enjoy the food especially the starters which I found extremely fresh. The naan was straight from the tandoor- soft, fluffy and hot! The downside was probably the gulab jaman which tasted a little frozen as I could tell it had come out straight from the fridge/freezer and hadn't even been warmed up. Traditionally, it is served warm. Prices are extremely reasonable especially if you order the combos (two can dine for 35-40$). I will definitely be ordering takeaway from Himalaya the next time I am craving indian food :):)"}
{"text":"Great indian restaurant on the south shore, the prices are very reasonable compared to others in the area who are more expensive.. The food portions are slightly small.. But overall it was good  We had to request for the heating to be turned on but we felt good right after  I recommend for take out or a quick sit in bite"}
