{"text":"So I'm updating my review because I came back to get a specialty chicken sub and this time i asked for specific toppings and different mayo. Doug was in the dining area talking with some customers and THE SAME girl that helped make my sandwhich  last time and was dancing and screwing around made this one as well. I got home and the order was wrong. If Doug isn't making the sandwiches they get f***ked up. He's only one man. Wish the girls had their stuff together"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very tasty and unique from your typical sandwich shop. However, I would recommend they do an overhaul and cleanup the fixtures and cooking space. Things aren't as clean as they should be. Food droppings and bread crumbs are all over. The back wall near food prep is disgusting. While I haven't been sick from there yet, I feel I've just been lucky. You leave smelling like burnt bread. An exhuast fan or ventilation system would be a great addition."}
{"text":"I am a very picky eater, and not only did they make my order correctly, IT WAS AMAZING! One of the best sandwiches I've had since I've moved here. I will definitely be back, the staff was very nice and helpful and did everything so quickly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Found them on Veebow.
Buffalo Chicken sub, awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and MAN was the food delicious! I love that this is a small local place with local brews!"}
{"text":"Had a great low carb lunch. Chicken with tomatoes onions provolone and ranch dressing. Really good and good for you."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place after moving to Gilbert, AZ from Scottsdale, AZ. I am a Vegetarian and some places I go for a sandwich have VERY few vegetables to choose from and bland cheese selections. Here, I can get what I want, including a variety of fresh cheeses, the standard lettuce/tomato, etc., and even sprouts, spinach, carrots, and peppers, just to name a few. I LOVE this place! Sit down, eat a sub, watch some sports on TV, play some foosball or arcade games, and just relax. YUMMY YUMMY. No place is better!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for 6 subs and 2 of them the bread was burnt and they got the order wrong on the other two. Very disappointed. We took them to go so we didn't notice until we got to our destination."}
{"text":"I have purchased take out twice over the last two weeks. Great customer service and tasty Spicy Italian sub."}
{"text":"Walked in after the lunch rush this afternoon, i ordered the Italian Sub Special.
1) Great sub! Bread was fresh and the flavor was yummy. Wish it had a little more meat
2)Great service! The guy who made my sub was very polite and made me feel appreciated. You don't see good service that often and not usually after the rush. I will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"The guy who made my sandwich did not change his gloves. His gloves were soggy and pretty much falling off his hands. I said something in front of the cashier and she never once told him I had requested for him to change his gloves before making my sandwich. Truly disgusted and don't even want to eat my sub now. Not to mention I'm pregnant and got a cooked sub to avoid possible contamination with lunch meats. Was not impressed will not be back. If I'm paying $22 for 2 sandwiches the person making it should at least change their gloves. Gross!"}
{"text":"I am glad I gave sidewinders subs a try! Amazing sandwiches and good customer service. Just wish it wasn't quite so expensive. I recommend the club if your stopping in!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and I will continue to get my roast beef sub here. The whole family loves their subs"}
{"text":"The subs are tasty and have good quality ingredients. The atmosphere is pleasant and its a plus that they serve beer, bottled and draft. 

If you come anytime around lunch order ahead. Even for a busy sandwich place, I shouldn't have to wait over 20 min for a sub. They need to revise they way they go about making the subs to increase their productivity."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are strictly based on the sandwiches themselves. Service deserves 5 stars. This was our first time trying this place (figured it would be better than subway), the bread is very mush, lettuce was disgusting, and overall the sandwiches were lame. I rate a lot on the food itself, and this fell very, very short."}
{"text":"First time here on Yelp recommendation.  It was the Bomb!!!! (Literally) Had The Bomb chicken sub....soooo yummy! Perfect combo of meat to veg to sauce. Serious nomnomnom. Impressive beer selection & even better beer prices. Service, price point, atmosphere,  music, televised sports....something for everybody. Gotta try this one folks!!!"}
{"text":"They never have white bread after 6pm! Like EVER! What kind of sub shop doesn't have white bread? Even if it's the end of the day you should not run out, that's just bad business!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a sweet sandwich spot!  Hard to find in a sea of Jersey Mike's and Subways... Thanks for the recommendation Yelp!  I ordered my Italian combo online which is freaking awesome.  Drove over and as soon as I walk in, I realize this place is legit because there are literally 30 dudes sitting/standing/eating these enormous beautiful sandwiches.  Only a few looked up when my redheaded self walked in.  You know them were some good sammiches.  Lol. My Italian was on point; sad they missed my request for pepperoncinis but the bread was fresh, the meat and cheese were like butta.. Next time I'll get it toasted; and now I'm dying to try the Hot Pastrami... I have a feeling they'd do it right!"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. It's clean and the people are nice. I went there today and got the 8 inch Italian sub, a drink and chips, total bill with tax was 4.99. That was the special of the day. All subs are great."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, good sandwiches and wraps, beers on tap, and low prices."}
{"text":"I work right next to sidewinders and get lunch there frequently. Friendly staff, awesome food, and always great service!!!!  Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop ever! Love this place! Wish they would make one a little closer in south Gilbert :D"}
{"text":"The worst sandwich I've bought in a long time. I had my husband get sandwiches for us for lunch. He didn't tell me right away that they microwaved my cheesesteak sandwich. I tried a bite and had to spit it out. After inspection i noticed the meat was gray and smelled old. In the trash it went!  

My husband had a hot ham & cheese. That was microwaved. He said the bread was chewy and hard. 

Sorry, there are no second chances for an establishment that microwaves everything. I'd rather have a hot dog from Circle K. No offense Circle K."}
{"text":"Thanks to Extra-Mile Floor Care I found this place.  I bought some for my family and they even had gluten free subs.  Try the meat ball subssss."}
{"text":"Excellent subs, had hot pastrami and Swiss. Wife had pico chicken and loved it. Said it was delicious. This place rates right up there with Lee's Hoagie House in Philly."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop!  Skip the chains and come to sidewinder instead!

I got the turkey on wheat. Great bread and tasty fillings.  

Servers were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"always fast service with value priced products that are very tasty.  I would recommended any time always consistent"}
{"text":"I LOVE their subs. They are really good...delivery is usually fast. They seem to be out of things a lot though, so thats the only con. Also online ordering is only during certain hour intervals throughout the day. Overall the best sub shop around though."}
{"text":"Pros:
1) Really good sandwiches
2) Beer (although I usually go with soda)
3) Pretty good chip selection
4) 4 big flat screens to watch stuff
5) Cute and friendly sandwich makers
6) The owner's name is same as mine
7) Close to downtown Gilbert

Cons:
1) It's 2.5 miles away instead of just 1
2) No WiFi (cost 1 star)

If you have unlimited data on your phone you can add the star back."}
{"text":"The subs are great and this shop is owned by Doug- a customer service oriented guy full of energy and positivity; there are not that many people like him around. He's also a metal fan, so you know he is legit!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sidewinders many times and continue to enjoy their sandwiches. They serve high quality sandwiches and reasonably priced draft beer. The owner is friendly and I am happy to support a locally-owned business."}
{"text":"Bad ass sandwiches best sandwiches I've ever had... anyone that says this is not a five star sub restaurant is out of their mind..., the bomb is exactly what it says the bomb..... Excellent service and even more excellent food"}
{"text":"Great subs, nice place for a beer - good prices and nice folks behind the counter. Quick service either to-go or eating in. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was courteous and prompt. The subs tasted great. We ordered a couple buffalo chicken subs and took them home to watch football.  We are fat and happy after this purchase. I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Great job."}
{"text":"Took the family the other night for dinner, we each had something different, my veggie wrap was very good, with a great flavor and also large ! Daughter had a salad which was large and nicely put together also. Wife had an Italian sandwich that she said had a little too many pepperchini's . Overall, the place was clean and welcoming with friendly staff. will go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing bread - shaved meat, large sandwich and Wise Potato Chips!  Top of this list and a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"super disappointed in my food today. I always get the bomb sub, and it's amazing but this time they literally made it wrong and put nothing on it but chicken and bacon which is NOT what I ordered! I'm pretty pissed off that I paid over $20+ for meat and bread. this is rediculas. I'm a loyal customer and this time the ball was dropped. the people need to be trained to read the tickets and actually make them right, if they can't do basic customer service, then they shouldn't be working there! I'm so angry and disappointed that I doubt I will ever order from there again, cuz of the lack of care and customer service. I want a refund. and I will not recommended this place to anyone ever until this issue is resolved."}
{"text":"I love the hot pastrami sandwich!  It's one of the best I have had. Love the new ownership and they deliver now. Awesome sub shop"}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious and fresh.  Our only complaint is we wish the vegetables like pickles and cucumbers were sliced instead of diced.  Otherwise, awesome food."}
{"text":"Solid subs, really convenient if you're in Gilbert for the motorcycle class"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Great food and atmosphere. The owner was friendly and greeted everyone as they came in. I would definitely go back either with my kids or with my girlfriends for a nice glass of wine or a cold beer."}
{"text":"Best local sandwich shop around. We've been going here for a few years now, and although they do get busy at time and the wait can be sometimes long, it's always been worth it.  The owner Doug is very friendly also and very customer service oriented. I hope they stick around for many more years."}
{"text":"The food here is good the atmosphere is nice as well the place was clean and the employees were nice as well I definitely recommend going here mid afternoon is a good slow time I will definitely be going back their sandwiches are wonderful"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Awesome sandwiches, great service and definitely family-friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place goes down hill in quality and quantity every time I decide to go back.  I won't be returning again.  A few weeks ago I got the cold ham and swiss.  No lie, it had 2 thin slices of ham on the bottom half of the bread.  What a joke.  I don't care to spend over $7 for bread and lettuce.  What makes me more mad.  When this place 1st opened, it was good.  For the past few years, it's a hit or miss, however you still won't find much MEAT on your sandwich.  And what happened to the slice of pickle that came with each sandwich!?!  High price for a cheaply made sandwich that lost it's thrill."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very friendly crew and awesome food! Thanks so much Doug, you have a wonderful business!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Cannot emphasize the difference quality ingredients make. The service makes the overall quality that much better."}
{"text":"My wife and I ran into this place a few years back and absolutely loved the experience. The staff was very friendly, owner was welcoming and you can tell he has a passion for what he does. I always get their daily special and have never been disappointed. The bread is rocking, and the ingredients are fresh. Great local sandwich place!!! Oh yeah, don't leave without getting their anonymous chocolate chip cookie!!! Epic!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had. We drive 35 minutes out of the way for Sidewinder Subs. It is the most crave able delicious sub shop."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Wrap a MUST HAVE. Was in town for work and decided to give this place a try. It was so delicious. Moist flavorful chicken. I'm very pleased."}
{"text":"food are fresh and we got a very good service, considering they're bout to close!!"}
{"text":"Very good subs but disappointed in their ability to make sandwiches the way you ask when it's being delivered to you. The first time I ordered a sub from here they didn't put onions on like I asked. The most recent time I ordered a wrap and paid the extra dollar for avocado and they didn't put it on. I also ordered a sub and paid the extra 39 cents for pepperoncinis and those were left off the sub. The subs are really good but it's very disappointing that whoever is putting the sandwiches together can't read what people ask for on their sandwich. Its very frustrating when it's something you paid extra for being left off."}
{"text":"Wow, I've lived in this area for 15 years and only recently tried Sidewinder.  Great place and great people working there.  Move over JJ this place is better.  I will be back multiple times I'm sure.  I wish I would have found them sooner."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out based on the reviews.  There were 127 or so reviews and 4.5 stars.  What a disappointment.  It took 40 minutes to get our 3 sandwich order.  BLT, Pastrami, and Buffalo Chicken.  I was tempted to ask for a refund and walk out.  When we finally got our Sandwiches, they where very underwhelming.  My wife who doesn't prefer a lot of meet, complained that there wasn't enough meat in her pastrami, and my Buffalo chicken was the same and I felt it was all sauce.  For the $27 we spent it is safe to say we won't be back. 

After receiving a response from Doug I placed another order which he took care of.  I ordered the roast beef and turkey sub and BLT's.  The Sandwiches were great and the staff was very pleasant.  Thanks for taking care of your customers and changing my opinion of your sub shop"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times already and every time was delicious. The bread wasn't mushy or soggy and all the ingredients were fresh! I've had the seafood and avacado sub twice, always perfect,  the amount of food you get for the price is amazing. I've also had the bbq beef (I think, it had pastrami and other meats on there), and I did double meat on that one, so much food!!!! Seriously for the price you pay it's a great value. I will definitely keep coming here even though it's ALWAYS packed."}
{"text":"Good food, but they suck at their delivery skills. We order online, and every time we do they call us and have to ask a bunch of questions. Fine, whatever. You'd think then, that our order would be correct when it arrives. Not the case. There's always one thing that's wrong. I'm not sure if we'll give them another chance to redeem themselves, but if they screw up one more time we'll write them off completely."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are SO good. I've always liked them but being pregnant, let me tell you I crave them pretty much everyday. I have to say the buffalo chicken sandwich is my favorite because eating deli meat is not on my menu right now. But the turkey sandwich is also so good. I order from them on Doordash too and I've never been disappointed. I also think the chocolate chip cookies are one probably in the top 5 I've ever had. I would give more stars if I could. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had the bomb! It was rich and the bacon was perfectly cooked. It was filling but overwhelming.

If I lived in the area I would come here all the time.  The price is great and the food is even betrer"}
{"text":"Nice and very clean shop.  Seems owner operated which is always good to see.  Subs have great flavor and getting them toasted is best.  Good bread but not great although I have yet to find great bread in Arizona.  The only down side to this place is that they do not put a lot of meat on their subs in relation to other shops."}
{"text":"The only reason they didn't get a 5 star rating is my extremely high standards for a good hoagie. Good prices, great ingredients (would be better with cherry peppers) and the service was very friendly. I will go back for sure. The sandwich fulled me up and I liked the selection as well. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome sub shop with great food, friendly staff and is very clean! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"fav sandys ever!  great crew and the owner does a great job of remembering his regulars.  Love that!  The bread is perfect, crunchy on the outside and soft inside."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time today and I had to try the buffalo chicken sub because I love buffalo chicken, it was amazing! One of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my entire life and the employees were extremely friendly. Its 20 minutes away from where I live but Ill be sure to come back!:D"}
{"text":"While you can eat here pretty cheap if you get the daily special, a lot of the menu is not cheap. The sandwiches are tasty, but not overloaded or anything.  I guess you are paying for quality over quantity.  I did notice they had Kiltlifter pints for $2.75 which is pretty reasonable, so if you add that in and average it out, you'd get a better value.  The service was very good and the workers were very friendly. This appears to be a family owned business so I say go here and support these guys... and get a beer with your sandwich."}
{"text":"Beer is back.  Oh yeah.  Best sub place in the Phoenix area.  Try the 8\" Italian- it is an awesome deal for the price.  They also have a stamp card whereupon you can get one free sub for every eight you purchase.  They also now have an app for your phone."}
{"text":"I used to eat here often until their sexist, male only, promotion was enforced to the highest degree. They made it right, but made us feel like we were republications targeted by the IRS. Side note, the food was good, as it always is. The owners should take a long hard look at their customer service and not implement sexist offers."}
{"text":"My go to delivery joint. I first heard about this place from a friend who loved going there for subs and a beer! I have never actually been in, but delivery is on point! Subs are huge, prices are great, and delivery is FAST."}
{"text":"TOP NOTCH SERVICE!!!!!! The subs they have are out of this world! If you're in the area check em out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Doug is one of the coolest guys you will meet! The staff is awesome and not to mention the sandwiches are sooooo good! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"HECKIN AMAZING! first time trying it out today. I placed the order today around 12 and it said it was going to be about 30-45 minutes, I was worried because I was already running late to work but I got over it because it was my fault I placed it late. I got there within 15 minutes and my sub was ready to go ( even though they were SLAMMED with people) the sub was delish and they were slangin' subs like bosses! THANK YOU"}
{"text":"I've been on the lookout for a solid sandwich place and I finally found it. Before Sidewinders, Blimpie's was about as good as I was going to get. The owner works the line just the same as the other employees which speaks volumes to me about his pride of ownership. Everyone that works there always has a smile waiting for you when you walk in. Oh yeah, and the sandwiches are AMAZEBALLS!"}
{"text":"Wow, great find for lunch.  Sandwich, chips, and drink for $4.95.  The sandwich was above average, friendly staff, easy to find and easy parking, free refills on drinks."}
{"text":"The wait was terrible. I waited about 20 minutes for my sandwich to be made. There were several customers who also had been waiting a long time. One of them had to get their order to go since their lunch time was up and they weren't able to sit and eat. 

The sandwich was super soggy and had really thick layer of mayonnaise. I had ordered a 6 inch and for some reason they gave me a foot long. I can't eat a foot long by myself so it was a waste of food. Who knows if I got charged for the wrong size.

There should be more than two people making the sandwiches. There were about five other people working. Two at the register and who knows what the other three were doing."}
{"text":"Great subs. Bread is always so fresh. Lots of options and they customize if you'd like."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try and was NOT disappointed!! I had read the reviews about the Italian sub but upon a certain someone's suggestion I tried \"The Bomb\" it was delicious!!! The chipotle mayo has a hint of kick to it! The sandwich was really flavorful! 
The staff was friendly and the owner Doug, made my sandwich personally! When handing me my lunch he took a few minutes out to have a conversation with me. Great touch!! 
Will I make the drive over there again? YES!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best subs ever! Fresh meats and veggies, and I love the concept. I also really like how the veggies are chopped up small so the sub is easier to eat. Inside has a pretty cool ambiance and the people are pretty nice. They also serve beer which is fun to come grab some good subs and a cold beer!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, sandwiches are fresh, the cookies are warm and the prices are fair! They deliver too which is even better!"}
{"text":"The cookies are great! They will even heat them up for you in their Otis Spunkmeyer oven! :)"}
{"text":"Placewas great! Definitely will be going back because who doesn't love sandwiches and beer?! Nice peaceful environment with football on as well!"}
{"text":"Started off on a downside, guy behind the counter seemed like he was having a bad day,  then my sandwich was not correct.  I was ready to give a not so perfect review when all of the sudden I bit into my awesome sandwich and all unhappiness went away. Long story short fantastic sandwiches and cold beer, great place will definitely return for another sandwich."}
{"text":"I had a weird first experience but waited until my second one before I left a review.  My first time ordering the delivery guy was a little creepy... after handing me the food he sort of lingered there staring at me.  I had already tipped him so I had no idea what was going on but it made me pretty uncomfortable.  I actually avoided ordering again for a little while because of that, but the girl who delivered the 2nd time was sweet and efficient and not at all creepy so that makes me feel better about ordering again.

Ok, onto the food.  GREAT!  The bread is the perfection combination of soft and chewy, the portions are generous, the proportions are spot on, the ingredients are fresh... I have zero complaints.

Specifically, their buffalo chicken sandwich is absolutely unbeatable.  I've tried a few other places and there's just no point in bothering.  This is the place.  You should know that this sub has cilantro in it.  I know some people apparently taste soap when they eat cilantro so figured I'd mention it since it's not on the menu I ordered from.  I love the cilantro though, I love everything about this sandwich. 

I also highly recommend getting a Peanut Butter Cup cookie.  Peanut butter cookies are not really my thing, but after eating one of these ones I pretty much have no use for any other cookie ever again.

It's a little bit cheaper than Jimmy John's delivery and the sandwiches are MUCH better than Planet Sub.

As long as you don't get the creeper delivery guy, I'd say it's a good bet you'll have no regrets on ordering!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple: this place is so damn good. The pico is the only thing I have eaten here and it is all I need. They also serve beer and have a great check on offer. Easy 5"}
{"text":"Bread and other ham and turkey sub ingredients are super fresh. Greeted by friendly staff. Sandwich and salad prepared quickly. Salad ingredients are very fresh also. I'll visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I would like to start off that the two stars does not reflect their food .... their food is actually 4 stars. However (and it's a big however), out of the last 10 times my husband and I have tried to order from Sidewinders, we had to cancel our order or leave it incomplete online.  Why you ask?  Somehow, a sandwich place is consistently out of white bread.  I literally can't understand it.  That's like going into Subway and they are out of their Italian bread.  It just doesn't make sense.  It's not just their white bread (although that's the most frustrating because that has caused 100% of our canceled orders since my husband won't eat wheat) but 2 of the 4 times we actually have placed orders, they were out of something else.  Once, they were out of the corn nuggets... I accepted and understood that.  The second time, they were out of croissants.  Once again, I accepted and slightly understood that.  That last 6 times we went to order and they're out of white bread?  I can't accept that. It's gotten to the point where I will give my husband two options for delivery (usually between Sidewinders and Chinese food) and while we want to order from Sidewinders, it's not worth calling for the high likelihood they are out of the most popular bread order."}
{"text":"I wanted to do something special for my neighbors who have been so helpful to my family during a recent health crisis. I ordered subs for them to have on a particularly busy day for them. They told me they thought the subs were awesome! I believe the quote was \"I don't know where you got these subs, but they are amazing!\" Thank you Doug! I will be back for more, even though I have to drive about 10 miles to your shop and I have multiple sub shops within a mile of my house. I appreciate the quality and fair prices.  If you ever open another store, will you please consider east Mesa?"}
{"text":"Good pastrami, but not filling. Coming from the East and Midwest where a sub sandwich ordered large comes large enough to fill a large 200lb plus guy and then some. Not so much the case here. Been here twice. Both times I ordered large pastrami and it was not that filling. I was still hungry after the sandwich both times."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. But they're skimpy. So if you are an eater, better order extra meat etc. I am from the midwest and later the east coast so I am used to a sub sandwich that will fill a big guy (not fat, just a large guy the needs more). Not the case here without ordering extra meat etc. Gets $$."}
{"text":"The subs are so freaking good here!  Some of the most freshiest fresh bread you will ever wrap your lips around.

I like to jump around the menu and try a little of it all and nothing disappoints.  The spicy italian is probably my fav and you have to try Zipps Voodoo chips.   Mmmmmm mmmmm.

The only reason I rate them four stars is they keep awful hours.  I cant tell you how many times we've been craving subs in the late afternoon/evening only to find them closed.  Sad city...."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and cool vibe. Happened to be in the area and stopped by due to the Yelp reviews. 

This is a sandwich shop that is more like a cool local bar. It's got a bunch of flat screens with games and other shows on, but the highlight is the subs. Great bread and fresh ingredients with big flavor. Their Italian is inexpensive but delicious. 

This place is definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Whenever I want a sub, this is the place to come. The food is great and for a good price. The only complaint I have is that our food has been made wrong the last few times we've gone. We order one of the sandwiches hot (hot meat on toasted sub). We continuously get a toasted bread with cold meat even though they wrote down hot. Not a huge problem, but when it's happened the last 5 or so times it gets annoying. One time the girl who made it told us that asking for it hot only means the bread is toasted with cold meat, even though the other sandwich we ordered hot came out right. We love coming here but it's frustrating when we have to play the game of will we get our order right. We will still come because the food is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here about 4 times and so far, they have the best subs.  The bread is fresh and soft, I prefer toasted subs. The meat is really good but a little thin at times depending on who makes them.  The owner makes them better, in my opinion. The staff is very friendly and pretty fast.  The cookies are huge, soft and full of chocolate chunks. Potato salad and macaroni salad are ok, tasty but way too much mayo, like drowning. We drive 30 minutes to go here. Check the hours before you go, they close early. Wish this place was closer to our house! Definitely a find!  Not a lot of tables and can be busy at times."}
{"text":"Doug, the owner takes making a Sub to the next level.  Right down to the bread, his Subs are awesome.  No chain shop here, and you can taste the difference.  Great job Doug."}
{"text":"Best subs in town! We order their catering platters whenever we entertain for a big sporting event. Just wish they were open in the evening."}
{"text":"I like this little family owned restaurant. The subs are good and the service is very good. 
They aren't fast but everything is fresh and delicious. 
The best thing is the delivery. We work about 1 1/2 miles away so I like to get everyone lunch at the showroom, especially on a Saturday. 
They have a good easy to read menu that makes it easy to place my order online.  
The first Tuesday of every month kids eat free. So it's pretty cheap to take my kids there."}
{"text":"I got the turkey and roast beef.

The bread was perfect, the meat was fresh, the veggies were crisp. It had good amount of sauces. I will certainly be back to try something else!

They had a great selection of chips and they serve beer!"}
{"text":"Yum! I consider myself to be a slight sandwich snob. I LOVE a good sandwich. The most important part is always that they have totally yummy bread. 

Check - they got it! 

Next they have to have fresh ingredients. Not stuff that sits out forever. 

Yup! - super fresh crisp salad and awesome tomatoes. 

Last they have to have a balance of the rest of the toppings. Meaning they don't put the entire jar of mayo on my sandwich and just a tiny piece of meat. 

They were so balanced! 

I ordered the spicy Italian. It was on special today and was absolutely worth it!!!  I will share the portion sizes are very large so just a heads up. Apart from an awesome lunch they have - Super friendly staff cute little environment and a clean restroom makes this sandwich spot a 5 Star!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting family from TN and decided to try this place out. 10/10 would recommend. The first bite we were in heaven. Quality subs, great price, and super friendly staff! Definitely coming back when we return to AZ. :)"}
{"text":"I'm impressed.  My new favorite sandwich spot.  Good clean, open environment.  Friendly service.  Good sandwiches.  Amazing cookies.  Good prices.  The only negative was the heavy advertising of gluten free bread and then they didn't actually have any gluten free bread the day we went.  I think my husband would have gone back again already if they had."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great daily deals. I don't know how many times I've been here, but this place is a great place to go for lunch. Back when I worked in Gilbert and I wanted a reasonably priced lunch that was fast and yummy, I would come here. I always got the Italian sub. It is good. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I grab a Club Sub to go 1-2 times a week, its always very very good with plenty of meat and really soft bread, even when the line seems long I get my sub incredibly fast. Also they have Utz chips and served which is also a plus (eay better than lays and lots of good flavors are offered)Sidewinder offers a better sandwich than subway or any of the chain sub places plus you get to support a locally owned business. Seems like a no brainer, eat here!"}
{"text":"Place is clean, the staff and food are super awesome!! They have many different specials and events. My personal favorite is Family Night which happens every month on the first Tuesday evening of the month. Kids eat free and they have a Game Truck, and others there to make it a fun time for me and the whole family!!"}
{"text":"Great place for subs. Much better then Subway, Jimmy Johns or any other national chain. Always fresh and get good service. The place is clean and has several TV's to enjoy while eating.  BBQ Beef is my favorite."}
{"text":"That little fella Doug makes a killer sandwich. Do yourself a favor and get \"the bomb\" it was amazing. Super friendly staff, quick service, place is jam packed during lunch time everyday."}
{"text":"Some of the best subs and sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I love the seafood sub and ham and Swiss"}
{"text":"This is a little local place less than 1/2 mile from my house. My kids love subs, so this is an quick dinner stop for me sometimes. It always seems busy to me, teenagers working behind the counter and I'm assuming thats the owner making the subs back there. I happen to be at the counter one noon time when he scolded the girls at the counter because he couldn't read their writing.

Subs are good. Their menu board is a little overwhelming to look at. I got my kids the BLT....I stole a couple bites and it was great.  The bacon was still  warm!
Bread is great here too. If you live in the neighborhood you get coupons for a BOGO every once in a while."}
{"text":"We enjoy going into Sidewinders for a delicious sandwich once in awhile. The last few times Alex made me the best darn sub ever. The sandwiches are always good at Sidewinders but I think Alex makes them extra yummy."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a delicious, reasonably priced, and GOOD vegetarian sandwich and with Sindwinders I've found it! always fresh ingredients and good size portions! the dude here is always friendly! do yourself a favor and try it out"}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich was amazing and had so many fixens to keep me full. Even though my cat Carl stole the meat from my sandwich for himself I still enjoyed what was left. That just shows you how delicious this place is."}
{"text":"Can we be honest and say Subway has gotten a little skimpy on ingredients? This was seriously a much better option, and super affordable! They also deliver and you can order online! Their pickles are THE BEST and all of the ingredients were great quality. And they have sides other than chips! The potato salad tastes homemade! I think I've found my new go to sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"The Bomb sub is awesome and the service too. A place to eat every week! The owner Doug and his crew make the best sandwiches in Gilbert. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I moved to the area about a year and a half ago and I've been coming to this spot regularly since! Awesome subs, cheap draft beer, great atmosphere. On occasion the young girls working have been rude over the phone, but the service in person is generally friendly and fast. I've never been in when the owner wasn't there helping out. If you want a great sub skip Subway or Jimmy Johns and support this great local business!!"}
{"text":"Everything here was really good besides the chicken in my buffalo chicken sandwich. It tasted like rubbery microwaved chicken with a funky taste. Pretty big bummer because the Italian was really good. The veggies are fresh and the bread is yummy. I'd give this place more stars if I had thought my sandwich was better. Just don't get the heated chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good sub. Lady at the counter was very helpful in pointing me to a great sub. Yummy."}
{"text":"Had an unusual you would think I am pregnant craving for Corn Nuggets . Googled corn nuggets in phoenix and this place popped up, so this is the reason I came here, their subs are why I will return. Food was great, service on point, very clean, and great prices. Oh and of course beer!"}
{"text":"A sub place that hosts bike nights, has beer on tap and has cute girls working? Count me in. 

I have been here twice now for the Team Arizona bike nights, second wednesday of every month, and been impressed both times. While not a huge crowd the place has been busy and they do a good job churning out the food in a timely manner.

The first thing you think when you walk in is that it feels like a Quiznoes...well that is because it was one in the past. Next you will be asked what you want and what choices of toppings and dressings you want. I like the spicy Italian combo  with everything hold the mayo. The meats here a good and seem more like at a traditional deli than a subway where it is over processed meats. I am not sure but wouldn't be surprised if it was sliced in house. All the veggies taste fresh and for a pickle lover like me they have very tasty ones.

I haven't tried them but I have been told the wings and fries are good here as well. Coming for bike night I usually show up with a group of friends and everybody has been pretty universal in the praise for the food.

Also the prices are good including a 8\" Italian combo for $2.99 that you really can't beat price wise. If you check in on yelp they have a check in offer as well. 

My only complaint is this place isn't closer to me and/or in an area I normally travel to but when I am in the area I am stopping in for more and when bike night rolls around doesn't matter if it's 100+ degrees I am heading over."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon to try this place out. DELICIOUS! Probably the best sub I've ever had. We tried 'The Bomb' and 'T.W.A'. both were really good. Staff were friendly and restaurant was clean. They also play good music"}
{"text":"I must say, this place rocks. Just moved into the area and this is now my favorite sandwich shop.  Fresh ingredients always make for a great sandwich. When it comes to restaurants, I'm huge on cleanliness and this place looks good. Can't forget their prices, those are great as well."}
{"text":"Had them cater a work event for 70+ people and they did a great job other than the driver got lost.  Once we had that figured out, everything was good.  The food was excellent and the quality & quantity of the subs was as good as it gets.  Nice job Sidewinder Subs!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times and I've never been disappointed. Great place, great customer service, and terrific food. Every time I go, I always try something new. My favorite so far is \"The Bomb\". I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves subs."}
{"text":"Tried it once from a referral on yelp and loved it. Have eaten there and loved it sense!"}
{"text":"Finally visited Sidewinder Subs on a Saturday. Family tried three sandwiches, the Italian (great deal), crab and avocado, and the club. Bread was very fresh and soft, meat was really good. Crab had a nice slightly sweet flavor, not too much mayo. Like the finely sliced lettuce on all sandwiches. Would like a stronger vinegar option for the Italian and a giardinara option would be nice, but we have both at home so no problem. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The value of the sandwiches and beer is aweesome. The food is great, the service is really fast and friendly, and it doesn't hurt that everyone working here are cute girls. Nothing to complain about. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I seriously order from them a couple of times a week. Ingredients are always fresh. They are generous with deli meat portions. Affordable. Rivals Jimmy Johns with how fast their delivery is. A gem. Independent delis of this quality are a rarity nowadays."}
{"text":"Been going for lunch for 3 months now, best sub/sandwich place around!  Period.
Try their chicken sandwich \"The Bomb\" with bacon and  cilantro!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Roast Beef Deluxe Sub (Mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions, provolone, mushrooms, sprouts)  and a Steak and Cheese (Mayo, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, mushrooms,  grilled bell peppers).  The latter had better flavor!  My big complaint is that the toasted sub rolls fell apart, they need better bread.  The place is set up like the typical sports bar with half a dozen big screen TV's.  They had half a dozen high top tables with stools and one regular table with chairs.  It appeared fairly clean.  Sunday lunch hour and only 2 people working, service was rather slow. I've been to better sandwich shops so probably won't return even though their prices were reasonable low.  I give them 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"We come back here every few months.  We've tried a few different things, and they've all been good.  As a sub shop they are very good (much better than Subway or the like).  I like that you can have something besides a bag of chips as a side dish (they have fries!).

The meatball sub I had this time was good.  Size was appropriate.  Fries were fresh and hot.  For what it was, it was very good.  We will likely keep coming back when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"I'm new to area and co worker recommend sidewinder. Went online ordered a extremely over priced wrap- paid for extra cheese and avocado. Went there to pick up, the girl at counter threw wrap in bag handed me a cup for my drink and answered phone, not once saying a word to me. Got wrap back to work and not a ounce of cheese.. The wrap was good, service leaves a lot to be desired.
Probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"Triple Ds.  Rad dudes, dudettes and delivery.

Thanks yelpers for introducing me to this Gilbert gem which combines great customer service, ridiculously fast delivery and fresh, quality ingredients.

The first time I called for delivery, some infectiously excited dude answered the phone and started recommending all sorts of ill shit -- from the Voodoo Chips to Buffalo Chicken.  Then he apologized that delivery would take 15 minutes... then the delivery girl showed up in under 8 minutes.  This young woman obviously broke some laws and land speed records getting these tasty treats to my doorstep.  And they do this every time!

They use fresh ingredients, including Boar's Head meats.  You can toast your sub as well. I've tried everything on the menu now and there isn't anything I disliked.  I would highly recommend the Buffalo Chicken, The Spicy Italian, Potato Salad and the Voodoo Chips.  I don't think they have a kids menu, but they'll make the kiddos a small three cheese grilled cheese as well as some other options.  Oh and their pomegranate vinaigrette is awesome too -- another recommendation from the kick ass dude who usually answers the phone.  

Not only is this guy passionate about their food and fast delivery times, but I could tell that he enjoyed what he does.  If this guy doesn't own the restaurant, someone in management had better tap him on the shoulder and position him to train every location this place opens.  Employees like this make all the difference.  

I'm a regular and can't get enough of this place!  My only critiques are that they need to stay open much later and could put more veggies and meat on their subs consistently."}
{"text":"Great sub sandwiches.  We stopped by here a few days ago in search of a \"different sub.\"  The staff was nice and the person who made our subs (I believe he was the owner of the establishment) was friendly.  You could tell it was important to him to make good quality sandwiches that his patrons enjoy.  I had the special of the day.  A simple, hot-turkey and cheese sub. What arrived on my plate was a very enjoyable sandwich.  He hit the sidewinder out of the park. I chose what I wanted to add to the sandwich and he made it taste awesome, which is what I look for in sandwich shops. Anyone can pile meat, cheese and vegetables onto bread, put a bit of sauce on it, slice it in half and serve it up, but it's the preparation that makes the difference between good food and great food and my sub from Sidewinder didn't disappoint. He knocked it out of the park.  It was prepared and toasted to perfection. My girlfriend had the steak and cheeses sub and really enjoyed her sandwich as well. We will definitely stop by again for another tasty sub.  I really liked the fact that they offer Gold Peak iced tea, too. Perfect combination.  If you're in the area and looking for a good quality-tasty sub sandwich than you owe it to yourself to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Huge fan since they've opened. Best place to grab a high quality sub and a pint. I couldn't ask for more. Now serving KILTLIFTER pints from Four Peaks (my favorite) for only $2.75! Always friendly service as well as the owner, Doug! I've never had them mess up my order, and the price is definitely respectful to the consumer. They feature daily specials and the veggie sub is by far my favorite compared to any other competitors. I'm sad to see the Chandler location no longer a Sidewinders. Known as Grinders, they still have that same sub style but nothing beats the original location."}
{"text":"Great tasting subs!  I order the Veggie sub. It's a better sub than the freaky fast ones."}
{"text":"Sidewinder Subs was SOO good - they were personal, got my order correct, and I was able to get on my way.  I got my sub warm, and it had cooled off a little by the time I ate it (I got it to go), but it was still one of the best subs I have ever had.  I seriously LOVE this place.  Absolutely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken sandwich I am a huge fan of. The service here has always been great even when busy. Only downside is price vs. portion, but I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"So good!!! Every bite was heaven!! Cool place, friendly staff. Nice spot! Never would've thought of this but drove by and had vaguely seen it on yelp but man I'm happy I stopped!!! I got Spicy Italian and it was great. I need to go here and try everything! Recommended indeed."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area (now I moved by the one in Gilbert) but came here a few times for grub. Just a heads up, their menu online is not updated with what they have in store. I let the manager know the last time I was inside but am not sure if it's been updated. So, I have ordered the turkey and avocado croissant, Italian sub and a wrap. Both tasted good but it is expensive in my opinion for what you get. I've never been in when it's busy (even during lunch time) so that weirds me out too. Their chip selection is also limiting...they didn't even have regular plain chips! Oh well, this place is sufficient for a sub bite but can't say it's amazing."}
{"text":"Second time around here, new to the area, husband loves this place and couldn't agree more. Ingredients are fresh and sandwiches are delicious. Not to mention their chocolate chip cookies, my kids just devours them. Prices are very reasonable and definitely recommended:)"}
{"text":"SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! We had a coupon and decided to try Sidewinders & are so glad we did!! The sandwiches are toasted to perfection and filled with so much goodness!! The staff is very friendly & work quick! We thought we'd have to get the sandwiches to go due to our schedule but were able to eat them there. The prices are very fair and compared to other sub shops, Sidewinders gives you so much more for your money! We will definitely be back!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Excellent sandwich menu. I love grabbing a sub here over most other places. The meats are fresh and the adds are awesome. They have the BEST GARDENAIRE!!  Highly recommend the toasted sandwich. And the daily specials are a fantastic deal!!"}
{"text":"Was working in the area on a Saturday and the boss said pull out Yelp and see what's for lunch today, so after checking out the Yelp app we settled on Sidewinder Subs, told him what I wanted and off he went to get us lunch!

I went with the grilled chicken breast sandwich, it was grilled chicken breast on a white roll with melted Swiss cheese, bell peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, mustard.  It was the perfect sandwich! If I lived closer I am sure I would be a regular at this place in no time! 

If you are looking for a good sandwich shop, give Sidewinders Sub a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Locally owned by a nice couple. They have great food with good ingredients. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. Took almost an hour to get to me. The wings were soggy and stringy. The meatball sub was ok."}
{"text":"Just like Frosted Flakes - THEY'RE GREEEAAATTT!!!

Oh man! Wow! The best! Amazing! Awesome! Stellar!

I can't say enough great things about this place! Amazing food, service, and atmosphere! Absolutely recommend this place to everyone!!! Try it. You won't regret it.

Hot pastrami sandwich is delicious! Great service. I love them."}
{"text":"The subs sold here are works of art. This is the food equivalent of van goghs strokes on a canvas. God himself blesses every slice of meat, every shred of cheese, and every grain of bread. I feel at home here and the staff are very kind human beings. 12/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Best subs around, go here you won't be disappointed!!! The turkey and pastrami is the best sub and I get it every time."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile, but a Groupon spurred me into action. It's not really close to my house, but I'd make the effort to come back. It was great!

The sandwich rolls are fantastic, for starters. I had the BBQ Beef and loved everything about it. My husband really enjoyed  \"The Bomb\" sandwich too.

I'd rather drive here than suffer through Subway or Port of Subs near my house. Good stuff..."}
{"text":"They prepared my sub how I ordered it. The meat was good, however, the lettuce and tomatoes weren't the freshest so the sub was a little soggy. 

The salad was well prepared. It had a lot of variety which I really liked! The dressing was quite good. The lettuce and tomatoes could have been fresher. 

Delivery time was about 35 minutes which was appropriate for the time of day I ordered. Delivery girl was super sweet."}
{"text":"The subs here are some of the best I've had. The owner of the shop is a really nice and personable guy. You can tell he is eager to have his business make a good impression on the customers. I prefer for the bread not to be toasted and it seems that's a standard for them, but easy fix to request it not be toasted."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend because we used to go to a certain sub place until they changed their whole menu. Sidewinders is really really good. I went with the always-can't-go-wrong club sub. Man, I savored every bite! Walking into the place it seemed chill and very laid back. Same goes with the employees there because you just felt really welcomed there.If you are a sub lover, go try it! Also, even got 15% off my bill with a check in, SCCOOORREEEEE"}
{"text":"I come here about 3x week and you won't find a better sub for the price.  Very fresh and delicious!  My favorites are the kicker (spicy bbq chicken), The Bomb(spicy chipotle), buffalo chicken and the Italian.

They serve fast and the place is hopping at lunch.  Highly recommend love the flavors."}
{"text":"Yelp is wrong...they are open on Sundays.  I had the meatbll sub.  Hot and cheesy with just the right kind if chewy soft bread.  I recommend this place if you're in the mood for a sub like we were."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood for two days and ate here BOTH days.  The sandwiches were super good.  I went with 3 colleagues on both days. Sidewinder was so good we came back.  Staff was great both times."}
{"text":"Been here several times and always have great food. I originally went here for the Yelp! cash back, but they no longer have that. Food is great and price is reasonable so I keep going back. Highly recommended, love supporting a local business instead of national franchises."}
{"text":"Stopped in after chiropractor appt int he same complex.  They lost my order and never made my sandwich, the owner noticed and took great care of me, including giving me an already filled out punch card for next visit.  
I got a double meat Pastrami sub for $9, BEST. SUB. EVER!  
Shop is very clean and staff friendly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think they must have been having a bad day. We've eaten their sandwiches a few times but probably never again. Stopped by for take out lunch last Wednesday. The owner/manager? seemed a bit stressed and was yelling at the employees for taking an order (ours I think) incorrectly. I ordered the veggie which was supposed to have \"all\" of their veggies on it but only had the basics (tom, lett., sprouts). I thought the flavor was OK but the kids were not impressed."}
{"text":"Ok
Zowie!!
Go there
Eat a Hot Pastrami
Smile the rest of the day
This place is the real deal.  When was the last time you went to a sandwich shop and all the tables were full and there was a line out the door?  The line moved quick and the food was up quick.
I was going to take a picture but ate it too fast.
Next time.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place a 3 1/2.   I would give it higher but I am super tough on sub places and just like my little quirks. It is just an opinion though.

I could see why the good people of the valley would give this 4 stars or better as sandwich places are not always that good out here.  This one is good though.

The help is very friendly and it is a cool place to get away from work especially.  

I am personally though not a huge fan of bread rolls not cut all the way through. Again just personal preference.  Also i don't like the onions cut as thin as they are. Finally I am not a fan of shredded peppercini's.  On subs I like cherry peppers better but rarely do places out here have them.  Jersey Mike's being the exception which I must provide a disclaimer is my favorite sub shop anywhere, ever.  

If they get cherry peppers they are going up a star for sure. 

Good place though. I have not had a bad sub here."}
{"text":"Love love love this local sub shop. Sub are not pricey and very delicious, Sidewinders always has an 8\" Italian sub on sale for less then $4.00, you just can't beat that. The wait is usually a bit long, but it's well worth the wait for these amazing subs. Sidewinders always gets the Carlos 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm the biggest critic of sub joints so for me to say this was by far the best meatball sub I've ever had is a huge statement. The quality is evident at the first bite! I highly recommend this place especially if you are looking for a new place to try. I'm a fan and I will be back."}
{"text":"Love their subs, the finely chops lettuce and fresh bread is a wonderful  addition to main flavors of the subs."}
{"text":"My appetite usually ends after half a good sandwich so I end up with next-day lunch frequently... I couldn't stop eating my Sidewinder sub until every bite was gone. Fabulous bread and generous with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a 2 star review for this amazing sub place... I love all the food here all the time and I go here with my fiance all the time... Well there is a problem that I think needs to be addressed and solved. Over the last two months we have gone to eat here 6 times... We actually ate there only 3 out of those 6. My fiance is allergic to whole wheat bread and 3 out of 6 times..during the weekdays around 5 to 6 pm..they have been all sold out of white bread and I refuse to eat there if she can't. I know there is gluten free options and wraps but that is NOT the same thing as a delicious sub which is why we go there... You need to start making more white bread because apparently that's what people order more over the whole wheat. I gotta be honest... I love the food here and the people are amazing...but if we go there again and they are out of white bread subs we will not be going there anymore. Please fix this problem."}
{"text":"SideWinder always delivers delicious subs at a good value. The staff are always friendly. They get really busy around lunch time so it's tough to get in and out quick, but that is actually a good thing because they make quality good tasting subs. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and service! Highly recommend trying this place,especially if you love a good sandwich!  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I actually ordered here on UberEATS on a whim because I didn't want to drag my kids out in the heat and wow was our food so delicious. I had the TWA and it's one of the best turkey subs I've had! I will definitely be eating here again"}
{"text":"Had this place delivered for lunch, I was thrilled to find a place that delivered something that wasn't pizza!  The food was fresh and hot when it arrived and only took about 20 minutes to show up.  In my opinion of your gonna open a sandwich shop there are a few kinds of sub you better get right, I start with the steak and cheese if it's an option, it was good.  The bread was toasted but still soft and pretty obviously made in house.  The steak was great, I just wish there had been a little more of it, there was a reasonable amount I guess but more would have been my preference.  The sandwich also had cheese which was melted perfectly and onions and green bell peppers.  The peppers and onions were done well, cooked but still keeping a little crunch which I dig.  I had a side of potato salad also which is one of my favorites and here it really turned out to be one of the highlights,  it was awesome!  It was kind of bake potato style, with chives and pieces of bacon, and it was DELICIOUS.  

Overall what we have here is a great example of a place that is using good quality ingredients to deliver a good quality product at a good price.  I will for sure be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were not good bland no flavor meat was cheap pasta salad macaroni and potatoes salad sucked too chocolate chip cookie was bad too!!!"}
{"text":"My co worker and I were in a heated debate on where to go for lunch.  I ended that convo by opening up Yelp. We searched the area were we're working in and stumbled upon sidewinders. The business had Great reviews and they offered a Yelp discount, YES!   

We walk in and literally beat the crowd by seconds.   I usually determine the worth of an eatery by the size of the crowd, good sign so far.  The place smelled of fresh baked bread and recently sliced veggies. I know that smell.  We waited in line for a few minutes and were greeted with smiles. I am a stickler for great customer service, I will not tolerate sub par service and will leave without question.  With that being said, they did great. She Explained the menu and style of their take on subs.  We got our food as fast as fresh takes.  The bread was toasted to perfection. Didn't leave the roof of my mouth in shreds and hand the perfect balance of protein and veggies. We got a punch card and will definitely use it. Thanks sidewinders, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The is the best sandwich shop I've been to in the entire country. Seriously. 

It's clear the owner loves what's on the menu, and wants every sandwich to be amazing."}
{"text":"Food is always solid. We have had them mix up some orders, but still excellent grub and solid service. Now our only major gripe is they need a better ventilation system for their fyer. We leave this place, and you need to change your cloths! Stinks like fry oil. May not be coming into the resturant anymore :("}
{"text":"Yippee!  Delivery!   Tonight we tried Sidewinder for the first time - food was hot and fresh - to our house in about 20 min.  We sampled the Meatball, Pastrami, Potato Salad & Reeses cookies.  All were pretty delish - and the price was decent - we'll be trying again soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to eat. Toasted Italian is where its at!  They are very friendly and treat their customers well.  It's a deli shop but they always have the game on one of their many tv's and beer on tap.   

I saw one of the other reviews post \"there is a long wait\". It's a mom and pops type of place, the owner is always in there working his butt off.I have never seen anyone slacking.  In the past couple of years I have only experienced maybe 2 long waits but it was completely worth it and not due to lack of effort."}
{"text":"Diggin' this place. Friendly staff, including the owner, Doug, who is always happy to see you. Nice & clean, and one of the best cheesesteaks in the east valley.

Great place."}
{"text":"If this place was closer, I would have to join a recovery group.  It truly is that good.  I've only been twice and ate the steak and cheese both times.  Be careful that you eat over the table because this baby drips. The place is well set up, very busy at lunch and the service was good...except for the 2nd time.  Everybody was working their butts off except one teenage looking girl.  The only thing she did besides text on her phone was get in the way.  She's gotta be the owners daughter.  This 2nd time my sub took 15 minutes but in the end, totally worth it.  I can see this place expanding to more locations."}
{"text":"What first drew my eye was the sign that said $3.89 8\" Italian Sub... first of all, there is no where in Arizona where you can get a sub that cheap let alone be a 8\" sub... so I definitely went in to check it out ...not to mention you get 15% off your complete order  for checking in with yelp ...which I only realized when doing this review ... but let's get started on the rating points 

Atmosphere..... very down to earth get together for quick lunch with friends type vibe ... high bar height tables and over all met the type of restaurant style it that the food complimented 

Staff.... the staff were friendly and seemed knowledgeable of their menu and food service ... however it seemed to take a while for the food To come up 

Food... when I went in I did notice the cookie display had a lot of broken crumbled up cookies in it  

The sand which was very good however it could stand to have had more meat on it ... as you can see from the pic attached ... \"where's the beef?\"

Over all I would say it's a great place to go on a budget .. but keep in mind you get what you pay for !"}
{"text":"I love this place- better yet my kids love this place. With my son having allergies it's nice to have a gluten free option. The oriental wrap is incredible! One of my favorites. It does get busy during lunch time but that's to be expected just about anywhere. I guess it just shows how well people like this place. But you can always call in ahead of time to cut down on the wait. With it being right off Elliot it makes it super easy to get in and zip right out."}
{"text":"I wish this place had more than one location! But otherwise it is worth the drive to get their pico sub! If you are looking for a local hole in the wall sandwich shop then I would highly recommend going here! The owner should seriously consider opening another location."}
{"text":"The decor could use some updating, but it's a cozy little place. They have a couple old school video games and some little league sponsor pics on the wall. I do love that they support local causes.

The sandwiches are filling. The bread is fresh.  Any sandwich place that has sprouts is a winner in my book! It's nearby and way better than subway. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! This is right next to my chiropractors office so I decided to stop in for lunch. I ordered a veggie sub and I was not disappointed! The bread     and veggies were very fresh. The only downfall is that it isnt close to my work in North Mesa, I would love to stop there on my lunch hour!"}
{"text":"Love all the different kinds of subs. Quick service and decent prices. Never went to Jimmy Johns or any other sub place since."}
{"text":"Love this place. The only thing that makes it not 5 stars is they are a little slow with orders. Everytime I have been there it has been 30-40 minutes for my sandwich. The food is great which makes it worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get an awesome sub. We drive from Florence to get subs from here. Reminds us of subs from back home on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes this place is fantastic as most of these reviews say. Holy cow, I have been jaded by sandwich and sub places the past few years because for the most part every freakin' sandwich is made the same way. Even those claiming 'originality' stole their idea off someone. But I gotta say, this place had a different presentation, and not only that, the flavor, the price. All awesome. I had the spicy italian (which hwas recommended the most) and it did not disappoint. I added jalapenos and got it hot and it was presented open faced. Melted cheese, delicious flavors, veggies and bread weren't soggy. And a 10' delicious sandwich and drink for less than $10.00?! Oh man, I am in this area a lot for work so I will be stopping by again for sure. Thanks guys, you were great."}
{"text":"Best sub/hoagie shop in the East Valley by far! Love that this is a locally owned business and that they use high quality products unlike most other places. Beer on tap is an added bonus as is the daily special on the 8\" Italian. Plenty of options, great service, exceptional subs!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for subs!!
Friendly folks, Great service and awesome sandwiches."}
{"text":"After coming now for over 3 years, I still love this sub shop.  The sub sandwiches are always awesome, the service is alway good, and the people who work here are very friendly.  Best sandwiches in town. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome hot pastrami (high quality meat).  They use Boar's Head meat and the bread is really fresh and tastes good too! The people that work there are very polite, courteous, and friendly"}
{"text":"I had a the croissants bacon sandwich and it was hands down the best sandwich Ive ever had in my 18 years of life like wow. 10/10 do recommend, will come again soon"}
{"text":"Not your typical boring sub sandwich joint! Sidewinders gives you that pub/sports bar/ family friendly feel! The staff was amazingly kind even in the midst of a weekday lunch hour rush. The food was FANTASTIC! We will be going back
Thank you"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I had such a great experience! The atmosphere was great, the staff was so incredibly nice, and the good was AMAZING. I just had to sign up for their emails, where they give great coupons and deals! I can't wait to come back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Great sub as usual has a great atmosphere friendly staff and very fast. The bread is one of the softest breads I've had in town that's why I always like to come back also you cannot beat the price. I would say the only downfall is they're only open till 5 a lot of us work during the day so to make it is hard"}
{"text":"Bad.

This is my very first yelp review. Enough to actually write a post. I got the wrong order on my sandwhich. There was Soggy bread on the 3 ordered sandwiches. Eating a sticker on the tomatoes. Meat quality isn't that of what I'd expect. I might of just had back luck because I've seen a lot of good reviews which leads me to find amazing places on yelp."}
{"text":"First visit there today and was impressed! I think i got a spicy italian sub-  meat was very flavorful. Wheat bread was ok. im looking forward to going back and trying a croissant sandwich. They also have zipps chips which are amazing and most places dont carry. Staff was friendly too.."}
{"text":"Amazing service! My usual is the Turkey on wheat. Love the chopped pickles. Pickles in every bite!"}
{"text":"Wow! Looks like I found a new go to sandwich shop. Ordered subs for our fam of 4 and all were very happy with our food. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Every now and then I work from home and the last time I did I had procrastinated in buying groceries for the week, thus, ordering delivery! I found this place through Yelp and honestly couldn't decide what I felt like eating from what I saw available so I settled for a sandwich. It's simple enough. I was able to order through their Yelp page which was very easy but not only because I couldn't decide what I wanted. They have a nice selection of sandwiches, however, I wish they had an option to \"make your own\". There is a comment box for special instructions for your order that makes life easier instead of having to pick out pickles or whatever. 
I thought the minimum purchase was a little expensive. I would have rather tipped the driver the difference between what I ordered and their required minimum but I ended up paying almost $20 for a meal when I only wanted the sandwich by itself (what I ordered had no option to choose so it came with chips and a drink that I ended up not consuming). I also believe it took around 30-40 minutes for my food to arrive which isn't too long in my opinion since I ordered ahead of time before my stomach started to rumble. Overall the sandwich was pretty good and a nice size for what you pay. The bread to meat ratio was about equal so I didn't feel like I was paying for a giant loaf of bread lol. I'd recommend this place if you live nearby and are in need of sustenance."}
{"text":"Been here several times now and never been disappointed with the friendly service and quality of food. Prices are very reasonable too and of you like a beer with your food, the bottled and craft draft beer prices are cheaper than your usual bar prices. Fantastic place to go. Only criticism is that it doesn't open beyond 5pm, otherwise this would be a regular dinner place too."}
{"text":"Received a recommendation of Sidewinder Subs from my boss, as this place sponsors his son's baseball team in Gilbert. I placed phone order for the catered 4 ft. sandwich (variety of Italian, Turkey, & Roast Beef) and separate order of Vegetarian Sub to accommodate our Vegans in the group. During my initial call, I was informed that I needed to place a catered order before 2PM the day before because 2PM is usually when they place their freshly baked bread order for the following day.  I called ahead and was able to pick up my order 30 min before my original time. Staff was friendly both on the phone and in person. I was able to apply the YELP 15% OFF DISCOUNT FOR CHECKING IN. Myself and the rest of my co-workers loved the subs! Vegetarian Sub came with avocado at no extra charge! Thank you Sidewinder Subs for making the process fast and simple and the subs great!!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful. Pickup or delivery is awesome. The food is yummy. Everyone is friendly. The restaurant is clean and pretty. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Just started working in the same plaza, so it's super convenient for me & let me tell you this is the best sub place I have ever been to. Everyone is super friendly & although they are very busy, they will get your food out to you ASAP! Everyone on the staff always has a welcoming smile ! My favorites so far have been the bomb sub & the chicken Caesar salad is amazing! I will definitely recommend this place to eveyone I know! Also, I come here so often the girls know my name & what I like to order. Definitely a great establishment! 5 stars & more!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over a year. Today I got a groupon for 2 sub and a 2 beers and when I try to get my card stamped lady says no! WTF!! Say I can only get a stamp for a subs I pay for! I did pay for the two I got! Ask to speak at a manager and she turns around and say that is how we do it. WTF it isn't like I got a free sub I payed for it! Worst customer service I have had! Good food but bad workers makes for bad experience! All over a punch card has put your restaurant from a 5 to a 1 only cause I can't put anything below that! Avoid any words with the assistant manager she should never be aloud to talk to customers! And to top it off delivery driver parks right in front using up space for customer parking! No cares given to costumers!"}
{"text":"Yummy subs!

My husband and I got the spicy Italian and the steak and cheese with onion and peppers :) we shared them and they were delicious! Perfect portions of meat and veggies to the bread... And the bread was so tasty too! 

We scored a groupon too :)"}
{"text":"Ok, Tired of Subway, very very tired... 

New Sub place across from my fave grocery store LeeLee,,, anyways,, went into SideWinder, and there was one other customer.. 

Checked out the menu, and then stood there,, seemed like about 5-8 minutes before I was asked if i knew what i wanted to order.. REALLY ?
no warm greeting, good am, afternoon, let us know when you are ready,, and yes, the other customer was already at a table with his sub,, After the fail in greeting and hospitality, I ordered and decided for TAKE OUT.. definitely no sense of urgency form the 2 working here and got my sub and drove 2 miles home.. Home, unwrap the samich, and the bread is totally SOGGY, and not from mayo or oil, but from sitting in water like soggy,, yuck, 1/2 the samich was no good,, there is no way that they didnt notice when making the samich.. 

If Lees sandwich took Credit Cards i would go there from now on,, but looks like i may need to drive a little further. !!"}
{"text":"Overall a good place with a friendly staff, good prices, and good sandwiches.  The meat to bread ratio needs some improvements for sure.  I ordered a steak and cheese sub and it was pretty laughable the amount of steak that thinly layered my sub."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying, Yes it can get busy and it may take longer to get your food.  However you cannot rush perfection.  I'm no doctor and I have no statistical data but in my personal opinion these subs are the cure all to everything.  Depression, sickness, diseases etc!   

I have never been let down by a single sub here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there on a sunday, nice staff, but they were out of white & croissant, so we got stuck with wheat. 
Guess they didnt plan that well for their daily traffic. 

Sandwich selection was decent, as well as the variety of chip brands. 
Beverage selection could use some work. 

Overall a pretty good place that offers a hoagie as change of pace from the run of the mill boring Subway franchises or toasted subs at cheba."}
{"text":"I forgot to bring my lunch at work so i decided to order food but didn't want anything unhealthy. I was so happy to find this sub place on grub hub and they deliver! I have to say my sandwich is amazing. I got the club sub meal and added jalapenos and instead of mayo did the chipotle. SO GOOD. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I recently re-discovered this place. I remember going here a while back and liking it, and now I live down the street so I go pretty often. I love the chicken wrap, as it seems to be one of the few places on planet earth that uses real chicken. Everything tastes fresh and is a good portion size. My only wish is that they would be open past 5pm. I'd stop by on my way home from work a couple time per week if they stayed open later!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place, so I'm here pretty often.  Service has never been great here....kinda blah, but I deal with it because it's convenient.  I came in today and the gentleman that prepared my subs was just downright rude. I can't bring myself to patronize a business that treats customers this way.  I will never be back again!"}
{"text":"Ok why is everything closed on Sundays in Gilbert!?!?!! I was looking for sandwiches and finally found this was the only place open!! Whatever, I'm hungry, I don't care. 

The menu was huge, too many options. Nothing really stood out and sounded amazing. Staff was friendly and patient. Place was clean and fun. Good beer options, but didn't order any.

SURVEY: when you see \"steak sandwich\" what do you think that means? ... I assumed, a thick cut steak... which sounded amazing. It was actually thin cut, shaved like a philly... I was disappointed. But could of been my fault. Flavor was ok, but lacking. 

But the kicker, bbq, ranch, chicken, jalapeños ... it was amazing. Great combination, wouldn't of thought of putting that all together. 

Macaroni salad. Honestly, I'm still not sure how I feel about this. Flavor was really good, even had cheese in it, but noodles were long, flat like kraft Mac n cheese... it was weird. Idk why but it bothered me. I think if they used normal elbow pasta it could be the best I've ever had... but pasta shape matters!!

I'd come back if I was in the area, probably wouldn't go out of my way just to go here though."}
{"text":"The turkey avacado croissant was to die for! The first Saturday of the month is kids eat free. Highly recommend coming"}
{"text":"These are the best subs in the valley! I love the turkey, roast beef and pastrami. The best item on the menu is actually the buffalo chicken. Give this little shop a try, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in Phoenix. They use very high quality meats and cheeses. I first tried it when they had a shop in Chandler next to the LA fitness. Unfortunately they closed that restaurant, but I'm willing to drive to Gilbert for a great sandwich. My favorite is the turkey and cheese."}
{"text":"On average we order dinner from sidewinders about 4 times a month. Every sandwich we've tried has been excellent and the cookies are ADDICTING! The delivery drivers are fast and once they even went back for the cookie they forgot! We've tried a few fried items off the menu and they arrived hot and tasty as well! Ordering online makes it super convenient! 

Our faves:
Reese's cookie
The meatball sub
The Italian (spicy or combo) 
The club
The pastrami"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and decided to check this place out because of the great reviews.  It lives up to the hype which is rare.  I tried the Spicy Italian, it was amazing!  I love the fact that the onions are thinly sliced so they add the flavor without overwhelming the sandwich with the oniony taste.  Staff was very nice and my sandwich was made very fast.  The dining area and kitchen are very clean.  They serve beer, have big screen T.V.'s, and deliver!  I can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches served quickly and a very friendly staff. The food was very tasty and priced right I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the first time and I thought it was just alright. I got the turkey and cheese sandwich with lots of veggies, toasted. I thought the turkey was a bit strange.... it might just be my preference in turkey, but this one was flavored (?)... it wasn't just plain roasted turkey, which is what I prefer. everything else was alright, so I will probably go back and get a veggie sandwich next time."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorite sub places. The bread is so fresh and soft. Every sub we have tried so far has been awesome, especially the buffalo chicken sub. Their staff is also really nice and welcoming. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Really yummy place for a sandwich! Fresh ingredients and day specials. 
You like ? Then you need to check this place out. 
If they had more bread options (than just white or wheat) I'd give them a 5! 
Smoked Gouda soup  My new favorite"}
{"text":"Great place - friendly people and terrific subs !! Always a home run, steak and cheese is my favorite- give them a try - appears to be a family run local business"}
{"text":"Ordered the TWA via Uber Eats and the sub was way better than I expected. Amazing flavor and incredibly filling!"}
{"text":"First off. The food was good. I had the Italian sausage sub. Tasty, nice sauce, good roll, sausage is sliced in little circles. I went at lunch time. Really busy. The locals call ahead. Good idea or go off peak."}
{"text":"Prices were very reasonable, the Italian sandwich was great and was ready within minutes of me ordering."}
{"text":"Awesome subs...and I'm not much of a sandwich person! I was sitting in the dock getting unloaded at PJ Foods & was starving...well, thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, I found this place under \"restaurants that deliver\". I called and placed the order (spicy Italian sub with the works...but NO mayo or mustard). I explained where I was and that I was in a dock around back...the response was \"OK No problem!\" Roughly 7 minutes later the delivery driver shows up, with a smile and a sandwich. We did the cash/sandwich exchange...plus 25% tip....the food isn't expensive).
Ok...first bite...my eyes rolled back in my head as I savored the flavors...REALLY REALLY TASTY!! As requested, there was no mayo or mustard, generous sprinkle of salt & pepper and plenty of pickles. I like it when I get what I order!
Nice people, fast delivery, and a great sub!! Now I'm wanting to deliver to PJ Foods again so I can order another sub!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I've had their hot chicken subs when I've been in and they're great.  The chicken is sliced chicken meat not lunch meat. 
Great place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I highly enjoyed getting to order from the Yelp App!!!! And I loved that I didn't have to order a minimum of $20 worth of food for delivery since I was just feeding myself! The Buffalo chicken sub with the works was delish! Although I think next time I will order light chicken or no chicken because the veggies were the best part! I will definitely order again! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and tried \"The Bomb,\" and it was so flavorful. The chicken was tasty, there was the perfect amount of bacon, and the greens tasted so fresh. The sub was loaded and I was extremely satisfied. One of the best hot subs I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Had \"The Bomb\" chicken sandwich it was so good and I don't like subs but this was amazing!"}
{"text":"Still loving this place! Got a buffalo chicken sandwich today on wheat with the works and it was pretty amazing for a sandwich. SCORE!"}
{"text":"545 on a Tuesday evening and the place is closed. Probably going out of business soon. This is the second time that I've gone there and they been closed one other time they were close because they had a private event. good riddance"}
