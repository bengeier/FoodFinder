{"text":"This place is great!  We came as a group of 5 on a Saturday night and had a fantastic time.   If you are coming on Saturday, make sure you don't come before 9:30 and plan to spend the WHOLE night here.  For Saturday nights, it is a set menu (we paid $45 per person plus alcohol) and you get loads of excellent food and entertainment.  Around 10:00pm, they brought out a bunch of appetizers (excellent baba ghanoush, hummus, lebneh with mint, Shanklish (which is a middle eastern blue cheese type of cheese ball), tabouleh, Kibbeh nayyeh (which is raw meet so I was pretty skeptical about but was delicious) and lots of pita.  You can keep asking for more of any of these items.  Around 11:00pm a singer came out.  Although I couldn't understand what she was singing, she sounded good to me and people got up to dance which was fun.  Around midnight, they brought out the meat (chicken and beef kabobs and kafta).  By this time of course, you are STUFFED but I had a bit of everything and it was all pretty tasty.  I don't think you can ask for more meat but truthfully, I don't know how anyone could anyway.  Then, a belly dancer came out and I think she gave about a 30 minute show and it was really good.  After that they bring out Turkish coffee and some sort of cheese dessert.  Then the singer came on again and sang until closing.  We stayed until 3:00am.  I would definitely recommend going to this place!  I'm not from a Middle Eastern background and it was a really great way to experience their food and culture.  I was with people who are originally from the Middle East and they all loved it and said it reminded them of home which I think is a pretty good recommendation!"}
{"text":"We went there with 2 other family , the food were nice , the surprise when the bill came he charged a flat charge of 30$ per person and this isn't a open buffet but more like a set menu of arabic mezza and grills not only this they charged all children above 6 yrs full price !!!!! . Cut a story short it is a rip off never will go back there . Don't recommend at all"}
{"text":"I grew up on Middle Eastern food and this place is exactly what I've been eating at family functions since I started eating. Nothing bad about the food here, it's as authentic as can be. Prices are a little expensive, but it IS a nice, large and clean restaurant. I'm looking forward to their evening entertainment one weekend."}
{"text":"WARNING!!! This is by far the worst Mediterranean food I have ever had in my life. I paid $40 for a chicken Swarma sandwich, Kafta sandwich, babaganoush and a fatush salad. Every dish was horrible. I recently moved to the east end from Mississauga and wanted to find a restaurant that could compete with a Mediterranean restaurant i use to go to a lot in the west. My search continues. If someone is reading this review and is ever in Mississauga go to a place called Monforts at Dundas and Hurontario. Also if anyone knows of a good Mediterranean restaurant in the Durham region please let me know of it. And again I warn people not to waste their money at the Mazza restaurant in Ajax!!!"}
{"text":"Entertainment fab! Food not so fab.  Makes for a good group experience, as the whole place is 'on theme' with the decor, food, music & shisha. Sort of felt I was crashing a (very small) middle eastern wedding reception as the staff appeared to be close family, everyone knew the music and were generally in good spirits.  Went on a Sat for the live music & set menu  @$40 (Shisha $20). Music began at 10pm and they were just fantastic! They played all night, even while the belly dancer performed - also brilliant and entertaining to watch - she used the whole dance floor so everybody could see. 5*  For some reason the food is not great, which doesn't match the venue! While the spread was impressive, most of the 12 apps/snacks  and even the mains were under-seasoned or just lacking in flavour - potatoes, cauliflower, tabbouleh, felafel, sausages - meh. I did enjoy the kibbeh (raw seasoned beef), along with the baba ganoush, but would have much preferred 2-4 well made apps.   The last main dish - chicken & beef kebabs - FINALLY, were tasty and tender. I wish this was served earlier when we were hungry instead of at 12.30am & full-but-not-satisfied! I'm torn between rating a 5* night based on 2-3* food. Considering this, it is an expensive night.  I hope they improve the menu because the rest of the experience was great, and I'd like to return for more."}
{"text":"Great Arabian nights. They have \"set menus\" on Saturday nights, which they keep providing food to your table till 3 am. Live music and belly dancing are there every Saturday nights and are amazing."}
{"text":"If you are middle eastern, then the food here will make you feel like it was flown from back home. There is a buffet available during Ramadan. At night there is a band and a dance floor so you can burn off all the food you ate!  To top it all off, they even have shisha that can be brought right to our table while you eat! It is truly a place to just relax and eat good food with good people."}
{"text":"This place is just an awful place to eat. I bought the shish kabab meal. Paid. 23.50 for about 2 oz of meat (tasted rancid) it came with a spoon of rice and a salad that was worse then the meat. I threw the food in the garbage and made my way to maimanna in ajax. I have never been so displeased."}
{"text":"If your looking for great middle eastern food in Durham Region, then this is the place.  My review maybe a bit tainted because I have been spoiled eating at fantastic middle eastern restaurants in the Yonge/Steeles area, but with that said for Ajax and the surrounding Durham Region this place is good.  Decor- you can tell that the owners basically bought this place as is, and haven't changed the decor much from the previous Greek restaurant it use to be, but it works. The restaurant is airy and a good size, would have preferred listening to middle eastern music instead of having to watch NFL football on the big screen tv's it's a restaurant not a bar. But overall decor is good, but I did find it weird that all plates had \"Woo\" written on it, must have gotten a good deal ;)  Food- the food here was really good. I ordered the Mixed grill. Food was flavourful, didn't like the lentil soup or the bread ( seems store bought)  Service- the staff was professional and polite, made overall experience great  Overall I liked this place, for Ajax and Durham Region this place is good. But make sure to call ahead since it seems that Mazza has dancing/dj's on certain nights and if your want a quiet dinner you maybe surprised."}
