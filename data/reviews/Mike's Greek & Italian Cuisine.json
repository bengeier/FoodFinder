{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday afternoon. They were not very busy at all, yet the server was inattentive and acted like he was too busy to really take care of us. He would ask \"Do you need anything\" (poor choice of words!) and walk away as he was saying it. At the end of the meal, he was very nice and talked with us for a bit. To me, this says that he knows he gave bad service and still wants a good tip. The service is the real reason this place got a bad review.

The food was good, but not amazing. I had a pasta dish and my other half had a stromboli. It tasted authentic to my un-Italian taste buds. If the service had been good, it would probably have gotten 3 or 4 stars."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, with trepidation, since past experiences yielded small portions. This experience had the same issue with small portions sizes in addition to other problems. The fried calamari appetizer was underdone, and soaked in cooking oil. The soup was loaded with lemon, far too much for our taste.  The description of seafood shells led us to believe that it would be loaded with scallops and shrimp.  What was served were button-sized scallops and a few microscopic shrimp, inundated with a sauce that again seemed overloaded with lemon. The chicken parmigiana was overloaded with chunky sour red sauce, with a strong overtone of unreduced white wine along with undercooked pasta. The overall use of the lemon on everything made it seem like they are trying to cover something up (old food?). We tried both the vanilla and chocolate tiramisu, and neither came close to the definition of a tiramisu, rather they were like sponges covered in sauce.

The positive note is that the server was very nice and attentive, and the coffee was great. But not worth the time nor the expensive cost."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when walking into Mike's was an easle with two documents posted to a bulletin board.  The first says in big bold letters, that the AZ Republic mistakenly wrote that they had 5 critical health code violations, but if you look at the report you will see that there are none.  The other document is the actual health board report.  My wife and I arrived before the rest of our party and we're seated promptly.   The decor is kind of mixed, some tuscan style murals on the wall, with a fake rooftop/awning that surrounds the restaurant I suppose to create the feeling of being in some kind of tuscan courtyard,  lots of track lighting dimmed to create an ambience to mask the fact that the building was designed to be a warehouse.  Overall they actually do a pretty good job of creating an atmosphere.  The service was a bit slow, but my beverage service never seemed to suffer, which makes me suspect the issues were more in the kitchen than the wait staff.  I ordered a double-thick stuffed pork loin chop from their specials menu which was described as a thick tender pork loin stuff with fontina cheese served with a mushroom, proscuttio and sausage demi-glace.  It seemed like we waited a long time for our order however it included soup which was nice, I had a cup of clam chowder, nothing special but not bad.  They also kept bring us more bread which I find a lot of restaurants are almost hesitant to give more than 1 or 2 bread services, the bread was served with a cup of hummus which wasn't terrible, but kind of watery and at this point sorry but FEZ has ruined me for all other hummus's.  The food finally came and this is where they made up their fourth star, the pork loin was very good and perfectly cooked I really enjoyed the demi-glace and it was served with I believe a squash and some kind of potato side which was very good.  for dessert I ended up ordering a slice of cheesecake hopefully to share, none of the adults at the table wanted to share with me and I was feeling very full, luckily my year and a half old niece was with us and although her vocal skills are limited she displayed her approval by thrusting the spoon in my general direction each time I gave her a bite.

Overall a good dining experience, Did I mention that Mike greeted us and checked on our table twice through our meal.  I always like restaurants where ownerscirculate to make themselves known but don't lurk.  The food was a bit slow coming, however I failed to mention my Father-in-Law ordered a braised osso bucco lamb shank which may have increased preperation time.  I would definitely go back to Mike's but would like my meal to take less than 2 hours."}
{"text":"I remember when it was in Peoria in early 2000s and it's absolutely wonderful. I'm happy to say that I'm a life long customer."}
{"text":"You've still got it, Mike!  I'm a fan from way back when you were in Glendale in 1993!  Visited for the weekend and made a special trip out to your new place.  Everything was delicious from the bread and hummus, to the canneloni with housemade pasta - wow!  Wait staff was accomodating and friendly too.  If you ever decide to open a branch in Los Angeles, I'll be there - do you ship?? :-)"}
