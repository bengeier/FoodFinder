{"text":"I love the food at this little place at the corner of dundas and bathurst! I have tried 3 dishes at Mazar;s Kitchen, the vegetarian bowl was the first dish which includes eggplant, sabzi (which is cooked spinach with chickpeas and other spices), and lubia (which is bean stew) because I just couldn't decide between which vegetarian dish since they all look sooooo delicious and this dish includes all three toppings on one plate! It was sooo good, it made me come back for more! I've also tried the beef caplee kabob which is so delicious it is definitely not just beef but a mixture of spices and herbs and the size of the kabobs are quite large and filling. The other dish I've tried is the tandoori chicken which is seasoned beautifully, its so yummy! I love the added sumac to the last two dishes it makes it look and taste delicious! With each dish they provide a homemade yogurt which is very refreshing and spicy sauce called chatni which has the perfect amount of spice...it has a vinegary twist to it its very nice! I love it on all of these dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this little spot in Market 707! I've tried the spinach sabzi bowl, eggplant bowl, and beef korma and they are totally delicious. The rice is cooked perfectly and the hot sauce hits a bit without being overpowering. The price is also right so I really don't think you can go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is just a bad day and they took it out on us, but our double-meat bowls were curiously sparse of meat! We basically paid $30 for a huge amount of rice, a few sprigs of lettuce that look like they were from last week's Big Mac, a sad tomato, and our own disappointment & regret.   In fairness, there was possibly a scant half-serving of meat (in our double-meat bowl). We ordered from foodora -- do not believe those tantalizing photos! Nary one of those gorgeous grape tomatoes in sight! We got duped. BE YE NOT SO STUPID.   This was so truly heinous that I'm furious I spent money on it, but am now soothing myself by spending more money on a different dinner. It's complicated and sad. Don't let this happen to you."}
