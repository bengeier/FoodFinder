{"text":"There were 4 of us adults and 2 children (a 4 yr old and a 16 month old toddler) and we got charged gratuity!!! The website said gratuity is charged for a party of 6 guess they counted the children as 2 people. The food was mediocre and not worth the prices charged for the dishes. Our server was grumpy and rude and refused to let me charge my phone in an absolutely empty restaurant. We asked her if she could add chicken to the pesto base pizza and she absolutely refused therefore customer service was a joke. I would not recommend anyone going there. If you're looking for good Italian food then Jamie's Italian and Scaddabush at Square one are much better options that have excellent food with much better prices and customer service to match."}
{"text":"They have wonderful authentic Italian food. The highlights are the fresh pizza and pastas. Beautiful decor and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went there this past week at 8pm, primetime dinner dining, and there was no one in the restaurant. A lady was in the kitchen and wouldn't come out to welcome or greet us. Waited for a good 5 minutes until deciding they did not want business. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I tried this place out the other night with some girlfriends.  What a great choice!  We saw some reviews and weren't sure but I don't know why anyone would give this place anything but a great review.  The server was awesome, the food was amazing and the place is so cute.  We started with the mushroom bruschetta and boy was it good.  We followed with the basmati rice,  mushroom pizza and saffron risotto.  How can I delicately say we all wanted to lick the plates?!  To round it off how could we deny an offer of home made dessert?  TIP:  Get the Dessert!  I  liked this place so much I was motivated to open this Yelp account just so I could give a great review!  If I could give more stars I would and I'll be back as much as possible!  I know where I'm going for great food and that happily stuffed feeling....."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and the food was so quick out of the kitchen. Loved the Adore Salad and our pizzas - so good! Will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on their website.  I guess I should have read the reviews.  They said they have a liquor license but nobody had Smartserve so they could not serve wine with dinner.  I can live with that but upon reading reviews it seems to me that they probably just don't have a license. To say the food was substandard and over-priced is an understatement. The dishes were all salty (most likely from \"shaker Parmesan\").  The pasta was seriously under cooked.  The portions were on the small side AND no bread on the table.  They asked if we would like black pepper and then brought a diner type little pepper shaker on the table. They price like it's a good restaurant but the service and presentation was more suited to a diner.  If you can't cook pasta you might want to rethink the Italian menu. Here's an idea.  You charge $24 for a bowl of pasta then there better be fresh bread on the table, Parmesan and pepper should be freshly ground at the table and wine needs to be on the table.  Pasta should not be soft but it also should not be hard like it was just shown a warm bath."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time and we definitely will be back. Our pizza, pasta and appetizers were amazing. Staff was very friendly. The one downfall is that it did smell a bit like smoke (cigarettes)."}
{"text":"Great, fresh pizza. Only problem is the location. It is too far from me or I would be a regular for sure. The ingredients were fresh, great balance of cheese on the pizza. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is an Italian restaurant with an identity crisis. They have a sign with \"Gourmet Pizza\" on it but we have been there twice now and they say they don't have any pizzas. Secondly they give you a menu and they tell you that we are doing specials and both times the menu has been the same so not sure where are the specials. When asked why there is no pizza, the response is the \"Chef is trying something new with Persian and Spanish food\". So my response to that is, they should try something new and change their restaurant name and remove Gourmet Pizza if they are nit serving pizza. To add to it all, the restaurant stinks of smoke and it is always empty. I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
