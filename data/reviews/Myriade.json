{"text":"This is my favorite coffee in the city.  Staff is A+  My only beef is that there's one dude who never opens on time.  I'd drink more of their sweet elixir!"}
{"text":"Je suis tombée sur ce coffee shop par hasard en allant chercher des bagels au St Viateur. Je n'ai pas été déçue du tout! L'endroit est spacieux et lumineux, dommage qu'il n'y ai pas plus de chaises et de tables pour se poser le temps de boire son café! Le café est très bon et les pâtisseries le sont encore plus! Les croissants sont délicieux !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of my favorite cafés in the neighborhood to stop and grab a pastry and caffeinate on mornings when I'm running a little behind schedule. It's got a lot of things going for it:  -I like the space-sharing (The space doubles as a retail store for man stuff). -The staff is nice and friendly and conversing with them in the morning almost always brightens my day. -I like the coffee. It's really REALLY good.   Although I love this place and will regularly gush about how much I like it to whomever will listen, within a few moments of conversing with the manager this morning, I somehow managed to get myself banned for life. (Yeah. It was weird and I'm still trying to work out how that even happened.) From my perspective (because there are two sides to every story), here's how it went down with this dude: -In observing him with a trainee, he was abrasive and unprofessional, telling her that if she didn't properly wipe out the grounds, she would 'f*ck up' the seal on the espresso machine.  -When his trainee set aside a towel that had fallen on the floor, and asked him for another, he picked up the old towel from the sink, wrung it out, and folded it back up on the counter for her to use. (I'm absolutely not a squeamish person, but having been a manager in food service myself, doing this in front of a customer is unfathomable to me.)  When my order was done (after he made her remake it once), I tasted it and told her that it was great and that I liked the one that she had made even better than the one her manager had made. 'Great job!' I told her, directing my positive feedback specifically to her. That was when her manager confronted me, and when he asked if I was passively 'taking a swipe' at him, I agreed 100% (because 100% I was). Then he told me that he didn't need my business and never to come back. He also told me that I was 'rude' to tell him how to train his staff, when my primary aim had been to give a little encouragement to a barista-in-training who was clearly frustrated and whom I sympathized with. As a customer, it is my right to express feedback when I am pleased/displeased with the service or goods I am buying. (Thanks, Yelp, for helping to make that happen!) As a manager, it is an asset to be able to accept customer criticism graciously, respectfully and tactfully -- an asset that this egoist manager utterly lacked today.  So if you like good coffee, and don't mind tactless management styles, I strongly encourage you to go to Café Myriade II.  If you're like me, though, and you value positive, uplifting human interaction with your coffee, I cannot recommend you go here.  Shout-out to the trainee barista who found herself at the center of this morning's fiasco: I'm sorry to have put you in the middle.  That was totally my b."}
{"text":"Solid pour-overs and a lot of sunlight."}
{"text":"My husband loves mochas, and their version is spot on (especially if you order it in a cup, to drink there. My husband is a bit fanatical, so he ended up ordering two cups each of the two times we went). In our view, the size is pretty large, despite what previous reviews suggested. Also, there was no bitter aftertaste. Rather, it tasted like high quality chocolate. The only down sides are that it is indeed a bit pricy ($5 + $1 tip) and the baristas could be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Stellar espresso. Grab your bagel a few doors down and then get your coffee here and enjoy a lovely breakfast in the park or wherever you get your eat on. But, yes. Great folks. Passionate about beans."}
{"text":"Pretty cool concept of a coffee shop, to set up in the front of a men's clothing store. (I think we saw a bunch of these all over Montreal.) There are five stool seats to drink your solid cup of joe at your leisure with gorgeous floor to ceiling windows -- for perfect lighting in those insta-photos hahaha.  But my absolute fave part? The sleepy Old English Sheepdog (aka Eric's dog from Little Mermaid) that tried to nap, away from needy people like myself who couldn't stop petting it. But it was so cuddly!"}
{"text":"The best cafe in Montreal now has a 2nd sexy location at Mile End!  Inside the curated white-tiled mens store Savoie Fils, the slower-pace and multiple-brew methods offered here make it even more engaging than the orginal Myriade.  Offering a list of coffees from some of the best roasters in North America - including 49th Parallel (Vancouver), Heart (Portland OR) and Ritual (San Francisco), there are several excellent options for both brewed-to-order coffee or espresso.  Some of the best looking baristas in Montreal staff this bar, and if you're hunger pangs get the best of you, famous wood-fired bagel are just two doors down, and several amazing restaurants are within a few block radius.  Now I have TWO amazing Myriade locations to choose from when I visit Montreal.  vive le café des baristas sexy!"}
{"text":"Good hot chocolate, but we came in hoping for a bathroom (I was 8 months pregnant and it took awhile to get there by bus), and they had nothing. Would possibly try them again for a to-go order."}
{"text":"Had a delicious cappuccino this morning! Milk was nicely textured microfoam and perfect temperature. Barista was super nice. They have coffee from 49th parallel and pilot coffee roasters."}
{"text":"Located close to the famous St Viateur Bagel shop, we normally stop off at this mile end coffee shop when picking up a few dozen of Montreal's best.   The shop is not big, but has a modern light interior.  Decent selection of pastries, but amazing coffees. You'll find all the standard fare. Today I had an americano and stayed stayed in because it was too cold to walk around Mile End. It's comfortable, and inviting if you need to stop by and work for a while.   It's usually busy, but the staff is prompt and efficient. It's a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Coffee coffee coffee and in style too! This is a beautiful hidden gem. Get an excellent mocha with a croissant and maybe a nice newspaper and pass the day away in style."}
{"text":"Location: In the Mile End. The closest subway is Laurier and street parking is available [metered].  The place: This is more of a storefront, really - Myriade shares the space with Savoie (a men's store). I don't recall if there's any seating space - I think there might be bar-type seating by the windows, but regardless, this isn't the place to meet your friends and you shouldn't plan to cozy up there with a book or to work. That said, it's got great lighting and a fresh vibe.   The goods: OK, I'm a fan of 49th Parallel and these guys use this roaster so I can't not be happy when I go there. They make a great Macchiato, and they also sell 49th beans. If you need them to grind your beans, they'll do that for you. If you want to talk about coffee, roasts and different ways to make your coffee, these guys will happily engage.   Service: Good - friendly staff!  Price point: On par with other shops in the area."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best coffee's I've ever had. Baristas were super friendly and the coffee was just impeccably tasty. Big difference with the whole milk being this glorious stuff: http://www.societe-orignal.com/products.html  I was only in Montreal for 3 days and wanted to try several coffee shops but I had to come here twice!!"}
{"text":"I was walking in front of Myriade 2 without even noticing it was a coffee shop for months - it seemed to me to be a hipster boutique selling clothes. Then my attention went towards the machine - could it be? Could it be a La Marzocco, sitting on the counter of an atypical environment? Had to step in for an espresso. It was smooth and citrusy and made my evening happy.  God bless the hipsters for opening third wave coffee shops."}
{"text":"I spend way too much time at coffee shops, way too much money on coffee...   But I loved my cortado from Myriad. The SF shop is great. A little on the expensive side, nonetheless great!   For a \"second\" location, the service & staff feels like the first location!"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble in this place, and are very glad we did!! The coffee was at every bit as good as the reputation of this place - sublime. We actually ended up getting stuck here for more than an hour because it was thundering and lightning outside. But it's a hip spot, and if you're going to be stuck at a place where the coffee is great and the weather is bad, you want to be here."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this unique coffee shop while visiting the neighboring bagel shop. First thing I noticed was the unique ambiance: the coffee shop is inside a clothing store! I particularly loved the white tile all around the shop.   Unfortunately, my experience didn't live up to my expectations. The menu explicitly stated \"syrup\" as an optional addition to drinks; however, when I inquired about adding syrup to my latte the barista informed me that they didn't offer any syrup in quite a condescending manner that continued throughout my visit. Perhaps I misread his tone, but I certainly didn't feel welcome at this establishment."}
{"text":"Very cool spot with the shop and great to air after you picked up some bagels. Friendly baristas too!"}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when a hipster coffee place has not only Aeropresses proudly displayed on the counter, but also a clothing shop in the back. Sadly on a Sunday the clothing store was closed, but the delicious brews were still flowing. Service was friendly and appropriately hipster, making a latte slowly by hand from the enormous stainless steel machine. The taste lived up to the presentation as it was creamy and just a tad biting, amped with caffeine. the latte actually ranked pretty high on my list, above Stumptown and Everyman, possibly even as high as Blue Bottle."}
{"text":"I walk in and they're playing Broadcast's The Noise Made By People, apparently from start to finish.  Memories flash in my head of seeing the band live, way back when I was cool.  I think: this is going to be a fine coffee shop.    Café Myriade is a few storefronts down from Saint-Viateur Bagels, and since the bakery has no seats, we popped in here to eat our bagels.  Politeness compelled us to order something.  I tried the cortado, which, after an all-night bus ride to Montreal and a prior coffee, had me bouncing round the city in some kind of hyperactive fugue state.    This is the least helpful review ever.  Sorry.  Here is a better, shorter one:  - This is a great place to eat your Saint-Viateur bagels and have an excellent coffee besides. - A clean, bright, airy interior.   - Good service.   - Good music.   - Poor wifi and not much seating.   - Sometimes, a very fluffy sheepdog visits."}
{"text":"I came here to join my friend to meet up prior to an event elsewhere and it looks like we used this cafe the way it was intended. I was initially surprised to find it in what I thought was a clothing outlet with almost no seating. Fortunately, there weren't many folks around so we managed to grab a few seats against the window. This place as reported by others, truly looks like a hipster clothing store. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place as a hangout but more for a quick pick-up of coffee. If that's their intent, they're bang on.  Myriade offers a variety of roast types and in a way... that's kind of neat. The coffee of the day switches up and your experience isn't the same. Some people like that. However, at the same time, it'll take you several visits before you know which roasts you like more than others. As luck would have it, the cappuccino I ordered was good but I've had far better. Now I'm unsure if it was the way it was pressed or the quality of the roast. Obviously, that experience may change.  I find the cost for the cappuccino very high, $4 and it looks like my barista really wanted his tip as he broke my $10 twonies where I clearly saw a stack of $5 bills in the cash. Greedy.  Don't know what to say, my experience here was pretty average and competition for great cafes around here is pretty stiff. I'll probably find myself back one day but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nestled in the SF shop, someone's got to be the cool kid. Myriade is it. For me, their brew isn't extraordinary and if I'm in the hood I'll be sipping my latte over at Olympico. The environment isn't made for meeting up with friends because it's in a clothing shop. That said, you can check out what's good on the hipster fashion scene. The bench out front is the best thing about Myriade: prime people watching. Best of Hassidic street fashion if you're into it. And I am. But all in all, ho hum."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop on the corner next to the famous St. Viateur bagel shop.  Great coffee, goes so well with bagels from next door!  The staff were very friendly and were so nice to help us with directions and some tips on seeing the city."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and pastries. It's a tiny place so be prepared to have a hard time finding a place to sit, but it was the perfect way to start our morning!"}
{"text":"Alright, I'm a Social Club and Olympico loyalist. I like to sit on these patios with my friends or my book and my bag of bagels. I love to hang out with the characters behind and around the bar. I like to feel a part of the pulsating heart of the Mile End schemes that are hatched here. But for exceptional coffee, especially bags, I have to admit I love this new little outpost of Myriade. Not Italian, this is Third Wave not Old World. Perfect pours, smart friendly staff, beautiful espresso machine, plus it shares a space with a man??-things-store that has the strangest and most weirdly sexy collection of objects, like sweet flasks and thermoses and general \"manly man\" gear. Goofy, and a strange thing to find on this street if you're remembering it as it was even 5 years ago, but yah know, I'm gonna go with the flow and say thanks for the great coffee and sexy gift ideas (and I mean gifts for me of course. I have my eye on you, flask.)"}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday morning after stopping by St. Viateur Bagel just down the street. An interesting shop that's both a hipster-esque clothing store and a cafe in one. The space is bright, modern, lots of natural light streaming in, and lots of stools and counter space to do some work or meet up with a friend or two. The winning point here was the service - they were super helpful and friendly.  I ordered a Mocha Latte, which cost me $6.00 total (included a $1.00 tip, which you're asked for if you pay by credit or debit). The size was very average, and the latte itself wasn't anything special. It left a bit of a sour aftertaste, which I didn't enjoy at all.   Overall, interesting vibe and great concept in terms of the shop/cafe environment, but I didn't enjoy the product itself. And for the above-average price I paid for one average-sized drink, I'd rather visit the other Myriad (ha, see what I did there?) of cafes on this street."}
{"text":"Great café option on Saint-Viateur O. You can't go wrong with any Cafe Myriade location, but this one is perhaps the best designed location.  Very good lattés and pour-over, beautiful minimal decor, and a great location adjacent/attached to Savoie Fils (menswear shop)."}
{"text":"Really good espressos. I haven't tried baked goods, but it is definitely worth it for the coffee alone."}
{"text":"Not too pleased with my first experience here. I had the barista grind me a French press of 49th Parallel's Old School only to come home and find that it was a percolator grind. Not the end of the world, but close. I trust this business so I thought that maybe I had been grinding my beans too roughly and that a finer grind would be better - it wasn't. Wasted a pot, grr.  The coffee of the day was real good, though I forget the title. This place still gets four stars because a) they serve and sell fantastic beans, b). They're next door to the best bagels in Montreal. And yup, there is a neat little man shop embedded in this cafe. Minus one star for the grind."}
{"text":"Cappucino for me was okay... Similar in flavour to dispatch. A very light roast. At $4 I'd much prefer to go down the street to Olimpico or Club Social. They do have a nice stools and a window seat facing St V where you can catch the action of the day walking by. The other half of Myriade appears to be a very expensive store. They had some North face jackets and other items that appeared to be double the price I've seen them at other locations. Another oddity for me was the fact that a coffee shop only takes cash or credit. It was mentioned that it was because they use square. However but it's rather shocking for me to see a place not equipped for debit as it is a very popular form of payment. They do offer a different blend compared to the other two places on the street however it's not my preference. The design of the place does fit the hipster Mille end look. For me it's not a place I'd frequent."}
{"text":"An excellent coffee bar that shares space with Savoie Fils, a men's store for the luxe lumbersexual fella in your life. A tempting caffeine hit after a workout at the Y or grabbing bagels at Saint-Viateur. 49th Parallel beans in the coffee and for sale. Dog-friendly, with a fluffy sheepdog named Monday making the rounds on some days. The staff may have entirely turned over in the several years Myriade II has been open, but the coffee is consistently great and just as good as the original Myriade by Concordia. Bar seating with six stools at counters facing Saint-Viateur through floor-to-ceiling plate glass windows. In the warmer months, outdoor benches with that Mile End collage of beards, pups and whimsy. No bathroom, no wifi, and occasionally an all-Beyoncé space (could I just have her as the soundtrack to my life, please)? Maybe it's the stylish threads, but you always feel a little bit like you're on the catwalk here, maybe even one of the coffee glitterati."}
{"text":"My friend, a connoisseur of cafe moka, highly recommended this cafe (note: she tried the cafe in the Concordia hood)  I am happy to say she was correct. Their moka IS amazing, the quality of the cocoa was great and the sweetness was never overpowering.  This St Viateur shop is an interesting combination of a) Cafe b) General store and c) Mens clothing store. Its a brilliant combination and permutation of clever loop holes. You have to see it to believe it!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great here. They have a variety of beans including stumptown which is one of my favorites.   The latte was very good and the barista was very nice and helpful. Lattes are about market price. The vibe at this location is pretty cool. Can walk around the shop for SF while you wait.   The pastries are good too. The brioche pinwheel is great."}
{"text":"Lovely shop with great pour over coffee options and excellent espresso. The staff is wonderful, approachable and very interested in talking coffee.  It is located inside a clothing store, so you may have a hard time finding it."}
{"text":"Café Myriade's second location is minimalist, clean and staffed with smart and friendly baristas. The espresso is great and so is the location, at the heart of Mile-End.  A few notes however: Because they do not have a proper cash register and use instead Square on an iPad to process transactions, they only take cash and credit (no debit!). There are no bathrooms in the place and, although the locale is nice, there are only about 6 seats available. One of the baristas informed me they were currently looking for a new point of service. I can understand why.  That being said, they still deserve 4+ stars as both the coffee and the service are flawless!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place, It's a new Café Myriade on St-Viateur. I must admit I was quite please to see another Myriade open thinking to myself that Café is alway full of students and kind of small making it difficult to have a place to sit and drink up. This is more of a Store with some \"Hipster Camping Gear\" if I may say. ( Kind of pricy compare to Sail or Mountain Equipment Co-op and limited amount of stuff) . They mainly have clothing for Men from Small to Large. Also they have some shaving gear and natural soap.  One of the great thing is that it's new, there's some place for more table, this is more of a store to buy your local coffee bag and maybe get a shot of cafeine as you stop there rather than a second-café-myriade."}
{"text":"Café Myriade, c'est un petit café, mignon avec des baies vitrées qui font oublier l'absence d'une vraie terrasse. Café Myriade, c'est un petit café où je ne \"fit\" pas du tout, comme une bonne moitié de la clientèle et c'est ça qui est bon. Café Myriade, c'est un petit café au sein d'une boutique d'accessoires et de vêtements pour hommes hyper clean qui te fait te demander si tu es bel et bien dans un café.  Le - ? Les proprios qui refusent de donner le mot de passe de leur Wifi et redirigent vers le Wifi public non sécurisé.  Si j'y retourne ? Mon café latte était bon et généreux, alors oui."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Cafe Myriade. I get there.. and realize the famous Montreal coffee place serves Vancouver coffee (Parallel 49). Umm...    Its still a good option for coffee. But disappointing that its not local and the beans probably aren't that fresh."}
{"text":"Really cool spot - great coffee, and a hip men's shop attached."}
{"text":"Why 4 but not 5 star?  Because they charge $1 if you order filter coffee and they don't have any left. So, they have to brew a new batch and they charge you for that. What?!   It's like going to a restaurant and paying $5 more because they have the soup in the menu but they don't have it ready.  Learn from other coffee shops: offer an Americano if there's no filter left and charge for filter. If the client denies, then it's your loss.   Other than that, the place is perfect."}
