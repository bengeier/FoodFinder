{"text":"My wife and I ate at Carver's because it was raining. I wanted to go across the street to another restaurant.   I'm so glad we ate here. We were very pleased with our meals. We both had perfectly cooked, medium rare, tender, tasty steaks (NY Strip and Ribeye), shared a Caesar Salad. Everything was perfect, service was excellent.   Thank you,  J&R"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly amazing. The table side Cesar is absolutely perfect! Presentation on every dish was exceptional and flavour matched. I'm surprised that this restaurant is far superior to the steak house across the street."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. .. we call to make reservations and they said we don't need one as its so dead and not busy that they don't recommend coming as they might close early as its not busy at all.  We went back another time by chance they were open and they took the tableside ceasar salad off the menu. .. horrible business decision. .. the menu is average and overpriced. .. we will not be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food quality! What an awesome Caesar Salad!  The 8oz. Filet melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Hmmm I am from out of town and had a business dinner here. Wasn't too Impressed considering the prices. As soon as we sat down we noticed a spider running across the table. They comped us a cheery jubilee that was nice and a wasn't necessary. The wine was nice. The house salad was meh. The lettuce was fresh and crispy but nothing to right home about. I had the sockeye salmon which interesting enough came with udon noodles. Wasn't impressed with the fact that for $39 I got a really small piece of salmon and a pound of noodle with 2 broccoli. The steaks that my colleagues ordered looked much better. Anyhow don't believe that considering the prices the food was worth it."}

{"text":"One of my best friend's, Kendra, shared a $100 gift certificate for Carvers with my other best friend Marnie and I.  The celebration was simply the three of us coordinating our schedules.  I have heard many good things about Carver's through my other friend, Debralee, and she was right -- this place is outstanding.  The atmosphere is dark, cozy and modern, and the staff is friendly and professional.  The waiter asked if we have ever been there before.  When we all replied that we havent, he began giving us suggestions off the menu.  We started with a delicious bottle of Cannonball Cab Sav.  He informed us that the caesar salad is made fresh tableside, so of course we needed to see that.  A friendly, charismatic gentleman pulled a cart up to our table, and asked us first if there were any ingredients that we \"didn't\" want.  We declined anchovies.  He started whipping up the dressing and then mixed a fresh, crispy caesar salad for us in large heaping bowls.  What was surprising to me, was how light the salad dressing was.  The dressing was delicious, but not heavy like caesar salad can be.  With our salads, they brought us out a basket of garlic toast.  The bread was delicous.  My only disappointment was that it was white bread.  Not their fault -- I will know to ask next time.  All 3 of is ordered steak diane.  I ordered well done, and the other two ladies ordered medium and medium rare.  Again, this was done table side.  We watched him     create our meal with perfection, and all of us had our tenderloin cooked to perfection.  Steak diane was served with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, which was a grilled tomato with cheese, asparagus and turnip.  The meal was unbelievable.  Dessert -- we couldnt possibly.  We were all stuffed. we ordered coffees.  Marnie offered an Irish coffee, and that was yet another delightful spectacle.  The cart came back to the table, and the waiter rimmed the glass with sugar and cinnamon.  He put a generous amount of booze in the glass and crystalized the sugar and heated the alcohol over the open flame.  He set the liquor on fire while we ooo'd and aaaah'ed.  Then he added the coffee and handed it to Marns.   Just before the bill came, he brought us 3 chocolate strawberries -- compliments of the chef.  Nice!  Carver's is now my favorite steakhouse in Calgary.  For me, it is not conveniently located at all, but it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good steaks and sides. Service is a bit \"relaxed\" not recommended for someone in a hurry. Amongst the better steakhouses in Calgary (Caesar's, Ruth Crisp's, Chicago Chop House) - easy to get to being the Northeast and free parking. It's hard to be as enthusiastic when you've eaten at as many Las Vegas steakhouses as I have. However, a good local choice for a meal."}
{"text":"From the Sheraton's website I was told that carvers renovated recently. Wow, did they do a great job! The lighting and decor really invited you in and stated \"classy dining\" I was very impressed. My boyfriend and I were seated in a little out of the way table, and it felt cozy and secluded (which was good for conversation). The server was alright, she was cheerful and attentive. She mentioned the specials and asked for drink orders... All normal and expected. I ordered a caesar salad to start- which was alright. Not something that would wow you, but defiantly enough for two people- so keep that in mind. The mains on the other hand, DELISH!  I ordered the leek cream salmon, it came with root vegetables and tomato risotto. The salmon was tender and seasoned perfectly. The risotto was amazing, so flavourful and delicious it could have held it's own as a main! The risotto and the salmon were a match made in heaven, just wonderful! We were too full for dessert, but from the rest of the food here, I bet it was top notch!  This place is a bit more pricey then most- so I would only go back for special events. But, if you are a food lover... Try the salmon, you won't be disappointed!  Also, the Caesar is no longer made table side."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try Carvers given my previous experience with Colors Café in the same hotel (short version, not great).  I am happy to report it was a much more enjoyable experience.  Located in the Sheraton hotel, Carver's atmosphere is casual, but still classy.  Prices are on the high end (especially for wine), but not unreasonable for a steakhouse - most steaks are $35-50.  We ordered table side caesar salads which were nice, prime rib, ny strip, ribeye, pepper sauce, and a side of mushrooms.  All of the items were very good.  The only complaint I could have about the food is that the sides of potatoes were a bit dried out, but that could have been simply due to being served on the same hot pan as the steak.  But such a minor issue hardly even warrants mentioning.  I would definitely return if I ever need a steak in Calgary."}
{"text":"The service was decent, and I really liked the bread, which included various types, each of which was delicious.  The shrimp appetizer we ordered was also good and was artistically presented with a variety of greens, small mushrooms and edible flowers.  However, this is a steakhouse, and I expected the meat entrees to be more than what they were.  The prime rib I ordered was a bit bland.  The hamburger on the kid's menu was just meat and bread without any veggies or pickles.   Although I was somewhat underwhelmed by the food considering the price, nothing we ordered was bad, and I might return to this restaurant if I stay at the Sheraton Cavalier again.  The ambiance is nice and very appropriate for dates and celebratory meals."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love our meal here.  The room is elegant but without intimacy even though we were in a booth with a wraparound banquette but that wasn't a big deal at all.  Service was on point for a steakhouse but the clearing of the table was slightly awkward as they stacked all the plates on top of one another, taking away what should have been 3 passes worth of dishes at once.  I don't mind that at a breakfast joint at all, but Earl's doesn't even do that and a legacy steakhouse with $45 entrees certainly shouldn't.  However that again was a slight misstep.  On the whole the service was great.  The real misstep was entrees.  Hubby had a 9oz strip which was of good quality,  well prepared to temperature but was under seasoned.  Needed some finishing salt at the least.  Vegetables were cooked perfectly, but potatoes had an unwelcome sourness that wouldn't have come from buttermilk or creme fraiche, so we assume the dairy that went in was proper spoiled.    My beef Wellington was well constructed, and arrived at the right temperature but with 100% certainty I can say it was microwaved to finish it.  Beef takes on an instant and unmistakable acrid flavour when microwaved and this had that in spades.  Also, foie gras medallion was inedible to the point of almost testing my gag reflex.  I didn't have a second bite.    My Wellington was immediately replaced with a 6oz fillet which was perfectly cooked to temperature but also under seasoned.  However the cut was of excellent quality and I really enjoyed it.  My veg were also cooked perfectly except for the sour potato mash.  Hubby also said he thought the texture would lead him to think instant potato flakes were whipped into the mash for stability.  Table served Caesar salads were deftly put together by our server, who again gave consistent attentive but not effusive service.  Wine service was also on point, and we loved our SuperTuscan we chose from their very impressive list.  Desserts were absolutely delicious.  Hubby had a lemon semifreddo which was more the texture of fully frozen ice cream, but it was excellent.  Very well balanced cream and bright citrus.  My chocolate soufflé was flawless.    Overall we enjoyed our experience at Carver's but the food missteps were too big to overlook given the price point.  Unfortunately would likely not return.  Too bad too as Carver's has been around for so long and we like staying in that property.  Food was 2 stars and service was 4.  3 overall."}
{"text":"Yumminess to the max! Loved the bread. Loved the tableside Caesar prepared by Linda. Our steak was divine. Really reasonable prices, considering it's a restaurant in a hotel. I highly recommend a stop here for dinner!"}
