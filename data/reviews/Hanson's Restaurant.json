{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because the staff seemed very friendly. Let me begin by stating I did take out the food so the quality could have suffered a tad bit. This is why I'm giving it three stars as opposed to two.

I ordered hot and sour soup, sweet and sour chicken balls and chicken dumplings. The hot and sour soup was pretty bland and salty, no real heat to it. The sweet and sour chicken balls were dry and made with dark meat. The dumplings weren't bad but the dipping sauce was way too vinegary for my liking. 

Yes keep in mind that it was my first visit here, and I only had a small sample of the menu. However, I can't recommend this restaurant."}

{"text":"As strange as an Italian/Chinese restaurant is, I felt that it worked surprisingly well!

I came here last weekend for my sons' 3rd birthday (more of a family gathering than birthday party) and we rented out the large party room that they have.  I think they said it seats about 40 people but we had half as many.

We ordered large platters of various items.  I enjoyed most of the items that we ordered and I'll list them below.  Some other items were just ok but I didn't dislike anything.

Vegetarian spring rolls: I absolutely loved these!  They're huge, maybe twice the size of a regular spring roll, and they were delicious!  The outside was crispy and the inside was filled with veggies and noodles that worked so well.

Lemon chicken: The sauce isn't overpowering and the chicken was crispy on the outside while still moist on the inside.  I generally don't like lemon chicken because the sauce is too sweet or bitter but I thought Hanson's did a nice job of getting it just right.

Crispy chicken wings: Huge chicken wings that were super juicy on the inside!  They taste like what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant but done really well!

Salt and pepper shrimp: These shrimp are lightly breaded and spiced really well.  This is key because most Chinese restaurants have a ton of batter.  These weren't too spicy and super delicious!

Thin crust pizza: The best part of the meal and this is the reason their restaurant can thrive as an Italian/Chinese restaurant!  While it's a bit pricier than your average pizza, the extra cost is worth it!  The crust was thin but not floppy and the taste/quality of the crust and ingredients really shine!

The last thing I wanted to mention was the service.  The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive to our needs.  Definitely some of the best service you can ask for.

Overall, I thoroughly loved Hanson's!  I'll have to try the rest of their diverse menu since there is so much there and they have lots of potential!  They've won me over and I'll definitely be going back over and over again!"}

{"text":"We were on our way to Shadow Lake camp near Musselman's Lake, Ontario when we discovered this unique Chinese and Italian restaurant. That sounds like a weird combination till you find out that a longtime Italian restaurant in the area got purchased by Chinese owners. It's generally a couple of dollars more expensive than you'd pay for the equivalent item at your average Toronto eatery. However, the food quality of everything we had was uniformly excellent, really piping hot, fresh and tasty and I had the best Black Pepper Beef, which is my fave Chinese dish, that I've ever had in my life! It's a good thing I had conventional utensils instead of chopsticks to eat it with, because it was SO GOOD that I had to scoop up with a big spoon, every last drop of all the chopped garlicky peppery goodness of the black pepper sauce, after enjoying thoroughly the beef, saut√©ed onions and green pepper pieces.

Hubby was very content to order a nicely battered haddock fish and chips. My oldest daughter decided to try the spaghetti. She just had one problem, not enough parmesan as she prefers. So I have a suggestion for Hanson's management: either have your wait staff come by to grate the parmesan personally to each customer as they do at places like East Side Mario's, which is the classier way, or provide a shaker of grated parmesan along with a shaker of crushed red peppers for each table ordering pasta or pizza as they do at Pizza Hut.  Cause cheese is VERY IMPORTANT, you guys!

All in all, provided we weren't broke at the time, we'd happily be back to enjoy the offerings at Hanson's Restaurant if we were in the area. Combining Chinese and Italian cuisine is a great idea!"}
{"text":"Hanson's is a nice little place that has a solid reputation for good food and friendly staff. I would say that the good staff and pleasant atmosphere are the best parts about Hanson's, but the food is also quite good. 

If you've never been here before, you may find the menu a bit strange. The combination of Chinese-inspired and Pizza is unusual, but the cooking staff is able to produce both with quality. The pizza is very good, and the Chinese food is decent too but the chicken stands out to me as particularly better than the rest. 

The place is seldom too packed, so anyone dining here is likely to have attentive staff members serving them. I like to stop here when I am in the area, and I highly recommend it."}
