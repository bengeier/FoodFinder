{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the service and quality of the food. Breakfast was really good!"}
{"text":"When I first came here, it was great.  Friendly staff, great selection and good Prices.  Then recently something happened and it went down-hill.  Now everytime I come in here there is no one there and it takes forever to get what I need.  

I miss the Kareokee Friday's and the loud crazy people that use to infest this place.  If the owner looks at this,  make some changes back to the old ways!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amy and Debbie are evil box trolls! but the graveyard guys are awesome! That guy chance is so hott! The girls are so rude and horrible! I really don't like them! They Also suck at making drinks! Breakfast burritos are the beez knees"}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar. They offer free pool, too- But if you're a regular they take a $10 donation for felt, cues, chalk, etc. That's fine with me, it's way cheaper and less crowded than PTS and the bartenders are quite a bit friendlier.

$3 PBR pints.

They also have a kitchen and booth/table seating. I haven't eaten here yet but saw the food and it looks A-OK.

It's right around the corner from my house, maybe I'll see you around!"}
{"text":"Nice bar in an out of the way strip mall. The staff was really nice but not what I was expecting to pay for the location and a bar with an average beer selection. However they did have a decent food menu, a couple nice pool tables and a lounge area."}
{"text":"Tried to give this place money. They wouldn't take it. Apparently if you want to purchase food from them \"to go\" after 9pm you have to waste your time by coming in ..ordering in person .. and waiting there until they cook it. because they won't take phone orders. Which is the exact OPPOSITE of to go. Since they don't want the money I'll give it to nearby competitor instead. No big deal."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot. And great food nicest staff. Ask for the chilli fries sliders and wings."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in, not knowing anything about this place. We weren't greeted nor was there a sign as to seating yourself or being seated. We had a lady walk by and ask if we had ordered. We said no, and that was the last we saw of her. After poking our heads over the booth multiple times, a man came over and asked if we needed anything. Eating or drinking? Well, I'm the only one here, so... fifteen minutes later, he comes back, saying You're still here? What would you like to drink? Seven minutes later, he comes back. Mind you, there was barely anyone here. We were the only ones not at the bar. We've been here 30 minutes and barely got our drinks. I hope this is just a bad night, because this is a terrible experience. Btw, it didn't get better. Stay away unless you want to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"You have to go in when Chance is working!

I promise you that you will not be disappointed. Fast drinks that are well made and an amazing personality. 
A bartender can really make or break a business, and he will make you have a good time. I always lose track of time when I'm in there. Fun times!"}
{"text":"Come see Nick!  Best bartender!  Good people!  Full menu all night!  Great recommendations, gaming machines and pools tables!  The pool tables might even be free if you're drinking!  Sunday, Monday and Tuesday's on grave!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. None one was in the bar and the the two bar tenders were apparently to busy to even serve anyone. Also seemed like they were were under the influence. Will never come here again or recommend this bar to anyone."}
{"text":"Open pool tables. Cold beer. That's a winner in my book.
Also in my opinion best wings in the valley. I have not had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Under new management the place is way cooler than it used to be. Open pool tables and improved food menu, drink specials and some upgraded slot machines and promotions.
You should definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"cheap drink, good food, open pool tables. my kind of bar. bartenders are always friendly and have good conversations with them."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place when we were living in Vegas. While it looks sketch from the outside, the staff is really friendly, and even the patrons are too! The inside is surprisingly roomy and has couch seating, tables, a non-smoking section, pool tables and a large circular bar.

The first time we ever walked in we were greeted and chatted up by the bar tender, introduced to a few of the regulars and then bought a round of drinks from another couple. This was our hot spot as we came here usually on Friday or Saturday nights and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Gravetender Chance is the best. Very witty and quick with service and jokes to keep the night going. Seriously, if there was an awesome bartender school, Chance would be in charge."}
{"text":"I have visited the Westcliff Station it is worth the trip if you get Michelle or chance. And they  have great chicken wings. .. and the machines really hit here.... really like to win this is a place to be take her from me"}
{"text":"Just ate there again, this time for lunch.  the service was good and the drinks were outstanding but the new bartender Carly was a freaking knockout!  i may make this my regular place to eat breakfast/lunch if bagel cafe closes down because i do love hot bartenders and good food and drinks, but i love desserts more!"}
{"text":"I have started frequenting this bar because of the friendly staff and amazing food. Chance the bartender is amazing, although he works graves. He is one of the best bartenders around. He treats everyone like a regular and is quick to take care of your needs. The food is also amazing. Try the tacos or the wings. They also have great drink speicals and and amzing selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Basic neighborhood Las Vegas gaming bar with great prices, good food, and cheap drinks. I drank $5 vodka all night, played pool, and had a delicious build-your-own hamburger. It's a bit older, smoky, but with comfy seating. Nothing fancy, but solid all the way around."}
{"text":"Eh. This place is ok but nothing amazing. When they say dive bars this is def. one...they have free pool however (2) tables and the food comes from Stop & Shop next door. That is the only reason I don't mind this place too much and the drink prices are not too horrible."}
