{"text":"Decent at best. Food is all frozen and has a weird taste to it. 

Great selection on meats and vegetables and sauces but being frozen gave them a funky taste and I left there with stomach pains all day which I never get from food. 

I'd be willing to try again if they had food that wasn't frozen. Make the veggie bar half of what you have but keep them fresh. 

Good idea hope it improves."}
{"text":"Amazing experience where you are the designer of your dish. You select from dozens of stir fry ingredients to make it your own secret recipe, millions of possibilities!  Then watch the grill masters expertly put the finishing touches on your meal. Great atmosphere and a healthy alternative. Highly recommend making Mongo's your favorite family spot!"}
{"text":"Fianc√©e and I were starving and stumbled onto this gem. Totally taken aback by the service and the experience! The concept is awesome: you start with a plate, go through separate stations of veggies, meats and sauces, then drop it off at the grill station to be stir-fried! I highly recommend trying out this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I have been to a Mongolian Grill restaurant in another country. I like the concept and so, when I  stumbled across this one in it's infancy, I was excited to stop.

The owner is really friendly and welcoming. The place is always clean and well kept. Staff are attentive. There are so many options that it makes it an easy choice for families who have different interests/tastes etc and it's relatively healthy. 

We don't live in the area and have driven out to Brampton from Toronto a few times to visit this one. 

The only reason it didn't get the 5th star was because there isn't a dedicated grill for vegetarians (however big or small), so while it is great at having more than enough to choose from for vegetarians, it's not vegetarian friendly in that sense which means we can't visit w/ all of our family members."}
{"text":"Hard working chefs on the grill. Ingredients are good.. no shrimp all night last night but thats alright because the beef was amazing. Waitress Bianca was friendly - they seemed under staffed. Don't do the salad bar if you can avoid it.. Wilted lettuce and some premade salads that are iffy. not worth it but the stirfry is amazing. Would 100% go back, and may while I'm still in town. Great selection of sauces."}
{"text":"Once again we had a wonderful dinner at one of our favourite places.  It was pretty busy tonight which was great to see, but sadly we couldn't watch the Baseball game while we ate our dinner.

As usual the staff made us feel most welcome and conversation was almost as good as the food.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"The selection of food is fantastic, and well prepared in the style of your choosing. Staff was polite and courteous and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Mongos is by far Brampton's best hidden treasure! It's healthy, delicious and the staff are great. The concept is so unique compared to anything else you can find in Brampton. If you haven't tried it, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Good experience overall.  The first time I stopped in I wasn't familiar with the brand but the staff were extremely friendly and outgoing.  They explained the concept and provided a tour to show how it all works.  I would recommend going here when you're very hungry and go with the all you can eat option for a better value- I find the single bowl for $15 isn't necessarily worth it, but you do at least get to fill your bowl with as much as you can from their selections, even meats! 

Not a perfect score- can improve on smaller vegetables perhaps especially the broccoli/carrots.  I find they don't get the chance to cook long enough because of the size. The frozen meats may not look as appealing however they weren't tough or grisly."}
{"text":"Wow! I really cant find anything bad to say about this place. Ive been to a different Mongolian Grill chain before years ago, and I was some what turned off from the concept for a number of reasons (overcomplicated, etc). After seeing the place on social media, I decided to go with the gf for a healthier option for dinner, and we were both sold. Mongo's really addressed what was lacking at the previous restaurant I visited in a number of ways...

- You receive a tour from the hostess to help you understand how everything works while giving you helpful advice on how to build your bowl. 
- Massive variety of ingredients to use and can be mixed with your choice of a number of sides (no carb option available). Options can lead you create meals far from the Orient region of the world. 
- There are helpful recipe cards available if you have no clue what to do when it comes to cooking. And these cards go very creative to show you how to create items like a pizza wrap . On top of this, sauces are well labeled with helpful advice on what pairs best with what proteins and how spicy a sauce is. 
- There are no additional charges for using certain ingredients like shrimp or calamari.

I am a foodie, but I am also trying to be healthy. Mongo's is a unicorn when it comes to healthier options as it tastes great & prices are reasonable (especially when you are gonna have more than one bowl). Because you control what goes into your bowl, its really up to you how you want your meal to be so anyone can enjoy this place. 

A great plus for me was that I was unsure on sauces on my second visit when I was approached by the owner, who quickly was able to look at what I had in my bowl and suggest what to add to complete the bowl. Made SUCH a big difference!"}
{"text":"Love the concept, affordable and fun. 
Portion size in your control and flavour too as you assemble your own stir fry. I loved it!"}
{"text":"It's FINALLY HERE! I have been waiting YEARS for this wonderful restaurant to come to the Greater Toronto Area. After having been to the Winnipeg locations, I had always hoped there would be one to go to that didn't involve transportation via plane.

You are in control of everything - from the ingredients, to the side dishes, to the portions. What better, healthier way is there to eat out? The staff are awesome and always welcome you with a smile. I have introduced several new people to Mongo's Grill and some have returned on their own! It's just that good.

You will not be disappointed - I promise!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Restaurant. Went there for the first time and absolutely loved it. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the food was yummy!!! A must try!"}
{"text":"My first time at Mongo's but not my first Mongolian grill experience. I have to say that I like Mongo's. Its a great dining experience and its focus is on being more healthier. There is no desserts per se but you can sign up for a free sundae on their website. The selection of veggies and proteins was diverse. I liked the pepperoni and beef the best. The workers kept refilling the options as they got low. I really liked that. I recommend that you just be creative and make your own creation. If your not too creative or lazy, use the recipe cards to make something. I suggest that you dont get something pasta based. It doesnt work well on a hot wok...:P Service was ok overall. Not great but adequate. Tony was an upbeat guy and he made up for an adequate service experience. Would I come again? Sure :D 4 **** stars."}
{"text":"I've been a guest of this restaurant several times. Never have they disappointed. It's a unique mix of Mandarine &  Hakka Chinese. The owner \"Tony\" always makes us feel welcome & treats us very well. I can't say what I had to eat except the Wicked Chicken Thai soup is out of this world. 

If you like a neat mix of eat what you design then check this place out its worth the trip."}
{"text":"The service is exceptional at this restaurant. I walked in completely unaware what Mongo's was all about and was greeted instantly by friendly staff. There was a server who walked me around to all the stations, showed me where the menu cards were and made some suggestions based on her favourites.

When I finally sorted out what I wanted in my dish, the guys working the grill were incredibly pleasant. All very knowledgeable and even complimenting my \"dish design\". I don't even care if they say that to every girl, it made me feel like I had this whole Mongolian grill concept down! The food ends up delicious every time I go there.

I really wish I had one of these closer to home, but kind of glad I don't. I would be there way too often."}
{"text":"Bad attitude of the owner 
The owner impolite 
Food below average
Try it to see if I'm right"}
{"text":"Excellent unique concept. All food is fresh and the restaurant is very clean. Great service and staff. I have already returned here three times since they first opened !"}
{"text":"Place was empty when we came in, had a really nice welcome from the staff. Got a nice tour of the place because none of us have ever gone.
$20 for unlimited make-your-own bowls of stirfry, pastas, wraps, tacos, fries rice, noodles, YOU NAME IT.
Owner was nice, place was clean.
Selection of food was good, veggies looked fresh - meats were frozen, but the place was kept clean and organized.

I don't know how this place would do when it's busy though, the lineups must be crazy to get your food grilled. 
The owner, (I think) was interacting with us, making jokes, asking us if the pictures we were taking were for snapchat. I told him I was a yelp reviewer. Nice guy, felt like he knew I was going to write a good review haha. But I genuinely had fun here! The food was filling, I could have done about 3 bowls. I made a seafood stirfry, and meat lover's bbq rice and I wanted to do a taco bowl after but we chose to get dessert. (Not part of the $20)

Also forgot that the salad bar was part of the $20, so if you do the Mega Mongo (more than 1 bowl), try the soups and salads!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad.. but it wasn't the best. First time here, not sure if I would go back. But it wasn't a bad experience. My food tasted okay, and the meat is frozen, why not fresh? The vegetables were huge.. lol"}
{"text":"Waaaaayyyy too expensive. And they get you to do all the work. They just do the cooking part, you have to actually create your dish. $15+tax for one small bowl(no drink included)???? much too expensive."}
{"text":"Wow...so this was different. My kind of place as I can make it as spice as I want as most time when I order spicy I get disappointed. 
Its suppose to be Mongolian style but they have many tastes in there. 
A buffet style but very affordable and everything looked pretty fresh. We were 4 and it cost me all in $90!!! Thats pretty good.
My favourite area was there spices. And their oils(Sauces) it really gave flavour to my dish. I did not have any noodles or rice so it was carb free stir fry for me. Meats meats and meats!!!
Service was excellent and the Boss talked to us quite a bit.
I told him that this place would be heaven if he had lamb on the menu and cumin spice. Then I would be eating there every day!!!
He explained lamb was very expensive and I know as I eat it all the time.
I will go back when I come back to Toronto."}
