{"text":"4 dollar ham steak and eggs with hash browns and toast served all day is a deal worth driving for. And $1 Bloody Marys and Mojitos is an added bonus. Make sure to order the eggs country scrambled, they know how to cook them. Can't review the rest of the menu but this breakfast and drink special is old Vegas relived. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here, checked in on Sunday the 9th of april, the next night I caught a bed bug crawling on my wife's leg in room 1507, when they came to see i got nothing but attitude from their so-called security, and their hotel manager LAURA SELANDER , was of no help either, not to mention their risk management department wich totally denied this thing I caught and handed to them in a napkin was a bedbug, the whole time treating us like criminals, !!!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been there in a while, the food wasn't that great but my family and I went last Friday, had the steak and egg special 4.99. It was delicious.  We will definitely go back and for the price you cant beat it!! If you haven't been there you got to go!!!"}
{"text":"No hot water, soap that doesn't lather."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place...  If you're looking for something DIRT CHEAP... This is not the place to go, because frankly, for the price you get here, you can find better places closer to the strip, if that's what you're after. Now, I actually got to stay there for free but I'm still going to nit-pick everything for your convenience.   1. Site said they're pet friendly, so we brought our small dog. Pretty much the deciding factor why we chose it... When we arrived at about 5am to get our room, we unloaded into the room, and finally bring the dog in. 5 mins later, their little downs syndrome security guard on his bicycle came pounding on our door saying they saw the dog on camera and that we're not allowed to have dogs here... Ugh, wtf? Your site said animal friendly.. So fk you guys! We put the dog in the truck, and surprisingly enough. We were harassed for about 2 hours by their security talking about the dog. They sat in the room above us, and continually circled our truck looking inside? Who the fk do you think you are? Harassing your customers and making them feel like criminals over a damn dog.  2. The rooms are not what the site says. There are no kitchen areas, no fridges.  3. The shower and toilet had a disgusting black residue all over it. Do they even hire cleaning maids?  4. The beds are god awful as far as comfort. At one point I took a pillow and laid on the ground... To my disbelief, the ground smelled like feces... Could this place get any worse? YES IT CAN!  5. During almost every cigarette break I took outside, a hooker either walked by or drove by looking for the room she was called to... So yea, if you're looking to be around that kind of stuff, this is the place to go.  I would give this place 0 stars if possible... They're lucky to even get one... This place is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life... Frankly, I'd rather stay in a Motel 6 than ever even thinking about this place... Avoid at all costs. Don't even consider. No matter how cheap their rooms are, remember, it's Vegas, there's a hundred places that are just as cheap and better quality."}
{"text":"Doe The price I paid it doesn't get any better, stayed for sema week, and my on problem was cab service because it's far form the strip but bus service is great get use to it and your a winner!"}
{"text":"Stayed here with the family on valentines day because EVERYWHERE was sold out. This place is one step above a rent by the hour motel. Our comforter smelled so bad I had to put it in the closet and close the door.  I didn't like how the hotel building was separate from the casino/ restaurants. Unless your in our situation and your option is to sleep in the car or stay here DONT stay here. I would recommend a station casino if you're staying off the strip. The only reason they got 2 stars was because the steak and eggs breakfast was sooo good and such a good deal."}
{"text":"This place is a dump..it's even worse than the other one on Decatur..several years ago it used to be like a budget suites weekly joints and lets just say they still have the same undesirables that hang around there mostly prostitutes & dopers/tweakers..."}
{"text":"In a day and age where customer service is sorely lacking, I really enjoyed the courtesy my family was show at Arizona Charlie's Boulder. We needed two rooms and the svelte lady, with short dark hair, at the front desk was so very kind to us! My adult daughter wanted her own room, and this sweet lady found a room right next door to us. This made it easier on our family to spend time together. It may seem like such a small thing , but I really appreciate her thoughtfulness & consideration. She went the \"extra mile\" for us which is so rare in today's \" me first world\"! Keep up the good work!!  The housekeepers were also very nice & deserve to be tipped for their work, which I am careful to do on a daily basis. My room was very tidy & clean. They even took the time to set the alarm clock to the right time, something I didn't do before because I was too busy. I will admit, the room was basic, but that doesn't bother me. I didn't come there to LV to camp in my Hotel room!! It's Vegas, baby!!! I enjoyed the bars, discounted drinks, live music, buffets, and restaurants there. Everyone was very kind to us!  The room rate was extremely reasonable. I really enjoyed staying here & will come again!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the casino only.   I had a lot of fun at the casino and although I didn't win much, my grandmother did. There is a large selection of games to play, your \"typical\" casino, I guess.   The service people were nice, however, the cocktail waitress hardly ever came by. Also, one of the supervisors at the desk was rather...blunt, to put it mildly."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place no star! Save your money and go somewhere else. My room wasn't clean well. The wifi sucks! I had to go to library to complete my work. Disgusting and full of smokes! Rude waitresses. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Ahhhh... Where do I start? Should I start with the local crackheads? The pimps or the ho's??   I'll just start with why I gave them 3 stars.   This establishment gets 3 stars cause of there customer services. Someone made an error on our reservations and we got upgraded to a suite and for even a less price so Kudos for that!   On to the ratchet mess my godson who's 8yrs old,  his mom and myself had to witness. As we first pull up I see women with literally just thigh high boots, panties and a see through top along with another working girl with basically nothing on. I can't believe Arizona Charlie's allow them to be around the front doors like that. Seriously, we were greeted by them. WTF?  But hey it was late I had drove for hours and I was tired.  The room we had was nice and clean. The building was clean but why have all that going on at the front entrance where people and their family enters.   The next morning we get up and get ready to head to breakfast at the local Denny's down the street and when we get off the elevator it was a man SMOKING CRACK!  Like right there smoking DOPE in the public. I said \"I can't do this\" so we went and checked out. I can't deal with Ho's AND crackheads!"}
{"text":"Would of given it Four stars but couldn't believe no free wifi...they charge you $11.99 per day for wifi, come on in this day and age not to provide free wifi that's a good reason to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I dont like to leave bad reviews because I feel thats the only time people comment on yelp, however, I feel people should hear this. my husband and I moved down here from seattle for a job opportunity. While waiting for our apartment to be ready, we chose this place because as everyone knows, its far better then any of the suites around here. After a long stressful day of dealing with finding our apartment, I pulled back the sheets to the bed in the bedroom, and there were 3 large fresh poo stains on the sheets!! I was horrified!! I then looked up...to look away...and on the ceiling was a fairly large blood stain!! on the ceiling!!! We immediately called the front desk and got the voice mail so we left a msg. After about 30mins with no response, we had to change out of our pj's and walk all the way back to the front desk. The kid at the desk was very nice, and just as horrified as we werr when I showed him the pictures.(which I would attatch if I knew how!) He moved us to a new room, but was a non smoking because they had no more smoking rooms available, and it was a lot farther away and on 3rd floor...and elevators out of order of course! He gave us buffet passes for 3 meals each because he said that was all he could do, but would let the mgr. know and see what she could do for us. We never heard from her, no apologies or anything. I gave 2 stars because the rest of the staff was great, and our second room was much better. But the lack of empathy from management, and lack of communication, really irks me. I dont know that I would ever stay there again, or recommend it. Just think people should know and be warned! Who knows whats on that bedding you CANT SEE!!  ***figured out pictures!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a worse place with more useless employees than at Arizona Charlie's. Specifically...the front desk supervisor. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 3 nights at a great price ($133.00) we got through Expedia. Check in was fast and friendly but upon check out a small problem arose with my deposit being returned. Alfter a couple of phone calls, this problem was fixed and I recieved my deposit. The woman handling this issue could have been a little more friendly in my opinion, after all it was their mistake. The room was big, comfy and clean with a seperate livingroom area. Nothing fancy by any means, a little outdated, but it was clean.The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the sink is right next to the bed. There is a 7-11 around the corner and I always saw security roaming around whenever we were coming and going which was nice to see. The buffet was horrible. We ate there once for dinner and once for breakfast. The prime rib at dinner was decent, the made to order waffles at breakfast were cold and hard, as was most of the cafeteria style food they offered. The service was good and friendly. The casino was nice in the fact that it wasn't overly crowded, had a good variety of machines and paid out decently. The beverage servers were non existent. This place is about a 10 minute drive from the strip. I would stay here again for the price and accomadations but definately eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Yukon Grille is the best. Don't waste your money at Ron's Steak House. This is the far best than that restaurant. Dollar wise you can't beat it. Our server was Annmarie  who is an asset."}
{"text":"This is a disgusting hotel worst experience. They don't clean the rooms at all, based on the huge blood stain we found on the bed. Unfortunately we had kids with us that day and they had to be exposed to this filthy, unsanitary room.    When the hotel personal was notified they just offer to switch our room and the room they had given us was a room that smelled like cigarette smoke.  After seeing that room and returning to our room, that I had not seen because I was out getting some food, we decided to go back to the front desk. We had taken our food back to the car a soon as my cousin mention the situation he had found in the room and before checking any of the rooms out (unfortunately we would end up eating cold food).  We had to wait over 20 minutes because the lady was on break and no one was there to attend the front desk. Not only did she refuse to give us back our money but didn't seem to believe us about the filthy room. She must have heard the conversation I was having with my cousins wife, about speaking to the corporate office if the lady didn't help us. My cousin was the one speaking to her and she had offer to give us back half the money and put us in the room she had given us, since they don't offer refunds.  She was saying that the room is cleaned and that there couldn't be any blood stain on the bed. That's when I stepped in and said it was dirty that we weren't making this up. That's when she said she was going to refund our money but first she had to send security to check it out make sure we weren't lying.  Waited another 20 mins security came to the room took pictures and left. My cousin came back up 10 mins later and said we had to be out of the room before we get our money back. Security was nice enough to approach us and assumed we had been told to leave the room because of sanitary reason. But unfortunately this wasn't the case, the only reason was to get a refund. That refund was only given because the lady knew I would contact corporate about this unsanitary hotel.    I would give them a lower star if I could would never recommend this hotel to anyone even if it was the only one available. Which reminds me the lady also wished us luck finding another hotel because they were all booked and it was more of the way she said it like she was hoping we couldn't find another hotel. Not the kind of customer service anyone should experience.  I also took pictures and video of this unsanitary room."}
{"text":"Had brunch today at the buffet and they had Oxtails as one of the meats. I also had a \"real\" eggs benedict which almost doesn't exist in Vegas buffets. For someone who has lost 60 pounds in the last year I'm picky about not wasting calories on crummy food and Arizona Charlie's has the best buffet items that I can pick from."}
{"text":"When I checked in I was told that I wasn't getting the roll away bed for my room that was asked for and paid for in my reservation 4 months ago.   I asked to speak with a manager, was told by front desk none were working except Security.   Security Manager Kyle came to my room, was professional and empathetic with my situation. He provided me with management's contacts and gave free buffet coupons.   About a 1/2 hour later he returned with a roll away bed that he found on property.   Initial bad situation turned for the  better!  Thank you Security Manager Kyle and Arizona Charlie's, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Worst stay ever!Checked in Friday March 23.Me and my friend went to Vegas for a friends wedding.If I could give Zero stars rooms were mediocre.But that's not even the issue.I was followed by head of Security Robert  klaus.like I was a criminal.My first time ever stepping in the casino other that registration that nite.7:30a.m. in morning I went into casino to check it out an look for my favorite game wheel of fortune but was harassed by security because of what only I could think of is the color of my skin.but at the time didn't know what to think as he cornered me told me I looked loss and I've been wondering around the  casino.(I thought that's what u do when you've never been to one before. I INFORMED HIM IT WAS MY FIRST TIME HERE AND I'M VIDEO CHATTING ON MY PHONE WITH MY FRIEND.IT CONTINUED TO QUESTION ME AND BY THE WAY  MY FRIEND ON MY PHONE HEARD HIS QUESTIONING ME AND UNBENOUNCED TO HIM HE WAS BEING RECORDED.I felt humiliated and went to complain to management.and was told I could leave a complaint with the same security office.which I did.I know this is a long but Am still distraught over this man and how I was cornered by not only him 'but as I was video chatting I review the video an showed it to family an seen a woman security as well behind me in back ground.Wowwww! What was a a middle aged blk woman no purse on her phone talking an being polite gonna do!  Please excuse the Rant or any misspellings.Never go to this Racist hotel!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  Don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed.  The most compelling reason why I won't stay at Arizona Charlie's again is all the smoke/smokers in the casino.  The help and service were great, Manny the bartender was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here for EDC Friday night to Monday night. We got our hotel for a really cheap price for a decent hotel room. We got a room with a king bed that was separated from the other room with couches and a tv. Which was perfect 'cause it allowed the sleepy heads to be separate from the people who were awake. Downside was that the bathroom and sink was on the bedroom side, but we managed. The bathroom vent was really loud, so it may have woken up my friends a couple times.  The room wasn't massively huge or anything, but it was a decent size with a decent amount of floor space. The bed took up most of the room. The couch and the furniture in the other room could be moved to make more space for 4 or 5 people to all lie on the ground comfortably.  My friends thoroughly enjoyed the $5 steak and eggs. They would order two plates per person. I don't like steak so I got to enjoy the farmhouse special or something with was bacon and eggs for about $3 or $4. Also enjoyed their $1 mimosas!!!   The service was ok but a bit slow. They seem to be understaffed, because there's only one person working the reception during non operating hours. Check in is around 3 pm, and check out is around 11 am, so I think around those times they will have 2.   Whenever we wanted something we had to wait for awhile to get it. We wanted towels, but because we didn't want to wait, we went to get it from the pool instead. The pools is nice and modest, this hotel is nice and modest. We're not complaining for the price.   The employees are friendly though."}
{"text":"This place an absolute crap hole. Yes it's cheap but the rooms are dirty, air conditioning sucks,  and I got a non smoking room that reeks of smoke. No taxi service, called front desk multiple times, and no answer.  Finally walked to the front desk, waited about 10 minutes no one ever came to help me. I will definitely stick to my hotels on Freemont or the strip."}
{"text":"I had booked the hotel for my dad who was visiting for the weekend. I didnt find out till later that my dad didnt have a credit card to leave the incidentals deposit per the hotel policy so my dad was a little upset and was trying to find a solution. The front desk person, Lacarra (?), was whom he dealt with. I was not there to witness the conversation between her and my dad, but I did speak to her over the phone to figure out a solution. She was extremely rude. I told her that all I wanted to do was find a way to fix this situation and I asked politely to speak to her manager. She told me that he wasnt there and he would say the same thing anyway. She started raising her voice and basically telling me I was wrong and there's nothing to be done except her way. I then told her that she needs to be a little nicer because I was being calm and nice to her and I expect her to do the same. She then gave the phone back to my dad, not wanting to talk to me. Later on, I went down to the hotel on my lunch break. I stayed nice and calm. Lacarra was there, didnt really pay much attention to me and had us wait an hour to check in. She went around a corner and I could hear her talking about my dad. It was very uncomfortable and terrible customer service. I ignored it anyways since I was told by Hotwire I could not get any type of change to my reservation and no refund. Overall, according to my dad, the hotel was nice. The front desk costumer service tho, was a nightmare and I will not recommend Arizona Charlie's on Boulder to any of my friends and family. We'll spend a little extra next time. I wish I could give this hotel a zero star rating."}
{"text":"Easily the worst room I ever \"stayed\" in. Got there the night after Christmas with family. Had booked a King Deluxe room through Expedia. When got to the room and it was 2 double beds in a dirty, disgusting room is disrepair. It looked like the kind of room that gets paid for by the hour.  We asked to leave to go find a real hotel room and they refused to refund me for that night, even though I didn't get what I booked and the room was nasty. I cannot advise enough to avoid this place like a disease--which might even by quite literal from the looks of the room we were given."}
{"text":"Stayed here Thursday 6/22/17.  Checking in front desk person was very friendly but as soon as you walk into the casino you get hit with the smoke..eww!  Got our rooms (2 rooms)...came in my room,..got hit with a good smell of icey hot...like if literally someone just applied some...looked around everything looked good except no remote, so i call front desk and she answers with anger in her voice...so nicely i said we just checked in and we dont have a remote...her response \"ok, ill send a tech to bring you one\". Ok good.....  2nd room...mold in the shower, walk right out and went to get a diffrent room. Front desk puts us in a \"suite\". Room was hot, but we thought it was just cuz they might of just turned it on...it stayed comfortable but never got cold.  Aftet waiting on this tech for an hour now...we left to pick up dinner. When we got back we noticed a man in front of our door...barely holding himself up with the railing....sister and I looked at eachother like wtf...she said maybe its the maintnance guy with our remote?!?! And sure enough it was, mr maintnance guy was soooooooooo freakin drunk he could barely talk to us and he already had bad english (mexican man). So between sister and i we had to look at eachother to try to understand him...and we speak spanish so it wasn't that we didnt understand...it was just that he was slurring out his words because of how intoxicated this man was.  After all this craziness, the rest of the night was quiet and when i went back to tge front desk to check out this lady from Gwam was there, very friendly and she greeted me as soon as she noticed me walking up to the desk.   For how much we paid and dealing with this drunk maintnence guy and rude front desk lady during check in...we will definitely put this hotel last on our list...."}
{"text":"This place is awful! We checked in immediately wanted to leave. The room was gross. Dirty carpets, nasty bathtubs, a toilet that barely flushed, etc. Customer service is definitely lacking. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a nice place off the strip.  The rooms were fine.  What they really need to do is power wash all the sidewalks and lower portions of the buildings.  That little effort would really improve the impression of the place.  My biggest complaint is their hotel check in and check out.  They have a lot of hotel rooms and only 2 stations to check in and out of your room?  Really?  Do they really not want hotel guests that badly?"}
{"text":"From Los Angeles and was here for Christmas. I did not feel like paying for resort fees or dealing with traffic. The receptionist  was super nice. Our stay was very clean and the rooms great  to stay in. I got  2 nights for $100 which was great!"}
{"text":"My complaint is specifically about the restaurant, Sourdough Café.  I had stopped there at 10:50pm last night to order a cheeseburger and onion rings.  The restaurant was practically empty with only about 2-3 tables utilized.  Like I have done many times in the past, I asked if my food could be delivered to the bingo hall as I would there playing bingo.  The manager who took my order said sure that would not be a problem.  At the beginning of the final game of bingo, about an hour later, I returned to the restaurant to find out what happened to my order considering I have never known it to take an hour to cook a cheeseburger.  Turns out my order was just sitting there on the cashier counter getting cold.  When I asked the manager what happened she replied very nonchalantly \"We are short handed so no one was available to deliver.\"  Couple of things: Number one, there were four people (counting the manager) standing at the cashier counter just talking when I walked up.  Number two, as I already stated the place was dead.  Number three, when I placed the order why wasn't I informed at that time delivery was not an option.  And number four just how long were they planning to leave my food sitting there as it was barely warm when I picked it up.  Very poor customer service experience."}
{"text":"Price was excellent, BUT that was it!   Front desk service is horrific, rudest, unprofessional rude individuals that work at the hotel check in desk.   Would rather handle all the phone calls coming in, then the people in front of them.  Rooms aren't that much better, inch of dust behind bedside table, carpet old and stained, bedspread and curtains look like haven't been changed or cleaned in 30 years.  If you want a place for the night or a flop house, as this place looks ok, if you want good service you won't get it here!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The restaurant on the second floor had the cheapest steak and eggs in town and the strawberry shortcake special was outstanding. Don't miss out on eating here, you will love it. Also the casino is good, they gave us cash back up to 100 dollars of losses on slots the same day. I don't think I have ever seen this before, it was very convenient. I didn't stay at the hotel but we had a great time here and I would recommend stopping by for a bite to eat and some risk free slot gaming."}
{"text":"Note: This review is strictly for the RV Park. Called this afternoon to seek some information. Woman with Hispanic accent was very short/not interested. I asked to speak to the decision maker and she was very rude. When I asked for the manager's name, she simply hung up on me. I called back right away and she hung up on me again. This tells me one of two things - Either the manager has not trained his employees to exemplify correct phone skills and be courteous to callers who are being courteous to them regardless of the reason for calling, or this woman doesn't want her manager to know how rude she is when someone calls. A little training goes a long way. Who do you want representing your organization? This woman does you a disservice."}
{"text":"I rate the hotel and casino 4 stars, however there was a problem I had with one lady who was working on the hotel lobby desk alone (I wish I got her name) but she was very rude and condescending and had awful customer service skills. I mistook the hotel lobby desk as the rewards desk for casino, since I was staying at the hotel. I then mentioned how much it would be to stay another couple of nights since I was at the desk already. Then she said what room I said 1505, she looked at me stupidly and claimed there wasn't a floor 15. I never even claimed there was, she didnt even know how the hotel rooms were labeled by buildings and treated me with a disgusting condescending attitude. I loved the $20 dining credit at Yukon Grille, and the slots were pretty loose. The rest of the staff were great and for the price the room it was also great. However that one employee the woman who was working at the hotel desk alone, shouldn't be working their, her attitude was disgusting."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out a different local casino so I chose Arizona Charlie's. What a mistake. This place f*cking sucks! First off, it's a locals casino so it should have better pay backs, right? NOT! Most of there machines have as low of a return rate than the Strip. All you have to do is check the pay tables. Wanna a drink? You'll be ignored unless you look like a homeless bum playing penny keno. Lots of loser bums in this place. Like cigarette smoke with crappy ventilation? You'll love it here."}
{"text":"BED BUGS!!!!  For starters, I stayed here during EDC weekend (May 17-21). When we arrived at the hotel and tried to check in to our room, the front desk receptionist not only gave us the wrong room but also gave us attitude when we requested a room change to a deluxe which was originally the room we paid for.   Then the following morning I woke up with multiple bug bites, then day after I woke up with more. I requested a room change and they switched us to another room but didn't follow through with their investigation as they promised till this day. (6/17/18)   No compensation was given to me even after I've talked to multiple managers and they still refused to refund me for those two nights I experienced the bites.   Never staying here again, nor do I recommend staying unless you're trying to get eaten alive by bugs.   Also they have shitty customer service."}
{"text":"The only good item on the buffet was the salad bar. The rest of the food had the appearance of mush!  Salmon looked white and watery. Fried Calamari rings looked good but when I tried them there was no calamari just breading. The part of the brisket which wasn't fatty tasted ok. All in all an unappetizing buffet. (The servers were attentive.)"}
{"text":"Had to be in Vegas for four days attending a trade show.  All of the hotels on the strip were sky high because it was a busy week.  Fifteen minutes east by car is Arizona Charlie's charging very reasonable rates.  Booked a double room which was clean and quiet and only about fifty feet from where I parked the car (try that on the strip!).  I was very happy with the room and will not hesitate to stay again.  The hotel/casino struck me as being very \"Old Vegas.\"  I started visiting the strip in the 70's and the hotels and casinos were much as AC is today.  For me, that is a good thing.  Inexpensive meals and buffets (of the non-fancy variety) complete the comparison to the \"good old days.\"  For those who want to save on room costs or who want to re-live what things used to be like in Vegas, I heartily recommend Arizona Charlie's."}
{"text":"Go play bingo! Didn't think I'd enjoy it but it was so much fun!! & their deli food is delicious. Recommend the wings. Can't really comment on anything else though."}
{"text":"I gamble quite a bit so I also receive a lot of promotional offer in the mail.  Well I received some offers and so I thought I would head over to ACB's and let me tell you that they really need to have HR talk to the staff behind the counters for the players club. The person talked down to me and acted as if I was bothering her because I was asking a few questions about how to use my card. I even asked why she was talking to me so rude and her reply was \"I told you once already!\" Well I finally had one of the security people give us help cause he had overheard the girl being rude to me. So I will say to anyone that asks from now on about Arizona's that it has low rent employees and they shouldn't bother. Plenty of other spot here to choose from and not get bullied. Liam Ps; However I did win over $200 on the advertisements offer of $10free slot play for the hassle. Funny she had told me I didn't have free play too. Hmmm"}
{"text":"To be completely honest, the only reason i'm giving 1 star is because quite frankly I can't give 0 stars.   For starters the people who work at the first desk need to work on customer service not only were they rude but they gave us the wrong room and when the issue was brought up, it was a problem.   Onto the room... the furniture was very outdated. The room smelt of cigarettes, although it was a non-smoking room, and like it hadn't been cleaned in many, many months possibly years. My family and I stayed at this \"hotel\" for 4 days and on the 2nd day, I woke up with insect bites but I didn't think anything of it because it's Vegas in the summer so I immediately thought mosquitoes. I WAS WRONG!! 3rd day there I woke up with two more bites... BES BUGS!!!   Yes the \"hotel\" is cheap. But the area is AWFUL!! In most words, it's not worth it!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in the Bingo Hall is excellent and all the callers and staff are super friendly.  But unhappy with their Lucky Slot Players....just saying,"}
{"text":"The place is horrible! Everything is outdated and the service in restaurants is below any eating establishment that I have ever been. Don't know how they keep the doors open."}
{"text":"2.5/3 for the hotel, 4 for the casino food deals and service  HOTEL (REALLY A MOTEL): Rooms are very basic, comparable to budget chains like Motel 6 and Super 8. No resort fee, but also no WiFi -- 12 bucks a day extra if you want that. Needless to say no in-room coffee, fridge or micro either. But it was clean enough, and maybe I just got lucky but it was quiet enough, and on booking sites you can get weekends for around $40 after tax sometimes. I would imagine Aceplay members can also get discounts and comps relatively easily since the rooms are so basic. OK in a pinch just to save money, at least if you bring your own wifi or don't need it.   CASINO: Looked like some OK pay tables, decent locals-focused place, honestly I didn't gamble here at all or poke around the machines much though. Points and tiers are shared between the other AZ Chuckles location and the Stratosphere.   FOOD: This is where the place really shined, the little grill on the first floor of the casino and the Sourdough Cafe upstairs had all sorts of nice deals, customer service was great, food was very solid. 10% discount on the already good prices for the most basic level of Aceplay cards and apparently discounts go up with the tiers too"}
{"text":"This place offers some of the best room rates anywhere in Las Vegas.  I had to stay in the area for a month and a half so this place really was a fantastic find for that situation.  The casino and food were not very good quality but the room was perfectly decent for the price and MUCH better than anyplace else you would find at their prices.  If I were just coming into town for a quick trip or vacation I would certainly recommend staying at one of the nicer places on or near the strip but for long term or if you need very cheap accommodations this place is fantastic for the price."}
{"text":"this place is deplorable. the carpets were filthy, only one outlet worked, i had to call the maintenance man to come in right before midnight to fix an  outlet.  also, i was bitten while i stayed over night. i am not sure what bit me, but i have a swollen right finger from staying here.  do yourself a favor, save your money, go somewhere else, and for the love of pizza, don't eat at that buffet. it was horrible.... absolutley expensive and horrible.  this is a real review, from a real person that stayed at this nasty deplorable place."}
{"text":"I was actually very surprised when i walked in my room. 2 rooms, with 2 beds! For the price.... it's SO worth it! 24 hr Bingo is another bonus. The buckets of beer for $5... FREE parking and NO resort fees. I just booked another stay here, it is my go-to place from now on. Especially when i dont hang out on the strip much... i prefer the double-down saloon and the dive bar.  There are security guards monitoring the parking lot. Im very thankful for that... especially since my friends just had their entire trailer stolen right off their truck in a parking lot at another hotel."}
{"text":"Decent, basic, affordable. I'll admit the previous reviews had me worried, but I gave this place a chance and left relatively satisfied. We needed a hotel room for EDC weekend. Our days in the room composed of sleeping and getting ready, and that was perfectly fine for me. The rooms were clean, carpet freshly vacuum washed, and the staff were very friendly. You get the basics of a room, nothing more nothing less.  There's no refrigerator, no safe, low lighting. Saw a bug in the room (bugs exist, plus we were on the first floor). Overall, if you want a basic hotel, I'd say this place is pretty good. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Our daughter lives in Vegas and had a \"local's\" coupon for a buy one get one free lunch or dinner buffet which we used. Had I paid full price I would have really been frustrated. Food was cold...the steam trays were NOT effective in keeping anything hot. Good way to produce bacteria and food poisoning. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet in town. Prime rib has NO taste, shrimp was cold. Very small selection.  One poor guy waiting on the whole room. He gave good service considering the amount if tables he had to take care. Will never go back even for free. My opinion is go to Sam's Town Firelight Buffet. Similar price and so much better variety and taste."}
{"text":"Three stars for cleanliness, good mattress and nice employees, but everything else is not so great.  1) crowded, confusing casino with no signage to hotel registration desk (and they have 301 rooms, all full).  But employees are friendly, ask for directions) 2) only 1 check in clerk at 8 pm. Bus was unloading and there were lots of guests around.  3) players card only gave 10% off for new signees - no free meals. But Tues is BOGO free buffet 4) put on 3rd floor of remote building (is arranged like motel buildings around central park and pool) but elevator was broken 5) grounds and pool well maintained and attractive. Pool looks clean. We had a nice view of it.  6) paid for \"suite.\"  Had huge front room with hide-a-bed couch and tv. Furniture sparse and old and budget.  7) small bedroom barely fit king size bed with tv 8) sink was one of the nightstands right next to my pillow.  9) dark walk in closet.  10) most important:  CLEAN. Even crevices around tub and on bathroom floor. Kudos.  11) surprise: mattress, pad and bedding looked brand new (I always check for bedbugs - even in 4-star hotels) If you need fancy, this is not your place (we won't stay again, too depressing). But I can vouch for our room which was clean."}
{"text":"Hotel Review: Location is off the strip on Boulder highway. I had a convention at Sam's town and this was a cheaper hotel. Location is within a mile of Sam's town, but the neighborhood was a little dicey. The back rooms are next to a trailer park and a 711 which makes the element not so great. In the hotels defense they did have security cameras and bike patrols in the area. Was last here in 2006 and was better then. Hotel rooms need a major renovation. Rooms were as clean as expected but so old you could only do so much. My non smoking room was only a suggestion I suppose and the 19\" tube tv was vintage to say the least. Pros: price , decent coffee shop in casino, no resort fee, parking close to rooms, staff is nice. Cons: old stale smelling rooms, 19\"tube tv, dicey neighborhood, rooms far from casino, rooms are like a motel 6"}
{"text":"Decent. Yet their stricter than at legit casinos? That's just mediocre I'm not coming here again but I was visiting my dad. I much prefer the strip and I will always  stick to them. Maybe if the rules  were  explained to us the first time we were addressed we would have listened but all they did was yell. Please save your time and money"}
{"text":"Very nice place a little off the beaten path but nice.  Friendly service and very accommodating with our requests.  Made sure our parties were close together even during the busy week.  Inexpensive was way cheaper than all the rest $70 a night versus over $200 for the others they give you two little rooms  very nice and the water pressure in the shower was great going to stay here again"}
{"text":"This hotel is the worse place to come to. They charge tou $11.99 a day for internet use. When other hotel has the internet for free. Plus I have a two children that drinks milk. So I asked for a a small refrigerator so in could store my kids food & milk. Never got the refrigerator but got charged. And our room keycard for our room did not work. Went to to the front desk explained ti them that the card was not working and then employee just walked away and left me hanging. Never came back. To everyone who is driving or visiting Vegas. Pleas please. Do not come to Arizona Charlie's Casinos Hotel on 4575 Boulder Hey."}
{"text":"I cannot give Arizona Charlie's Hotel less than a single star, and they only deserve that single star for the upstanding front desk staff who handled the issues with grace and professionalism. My husband and I checked in about 2AM October 31, it was the beginning of our anniversary.  We live locally, but wanted our anniversary away from home and our kids, just to have our special day together.  We had just seen a great tribute concert and a small venue and headed to Arizona Charlie's to turn in for the night.  We already had a reservation for the following night, but asked the desk clerk if we could add this night on.  She checked, and yes our room was available, she made the adjustments and as she did, we chatted about this was our anniversary, we had just seen a fabulous concert, and how I had a bad headache because I wasn't used to the loudness I experienced.  She offered there was a 7-11 next door where I could get some Ibuprofen if I needed, but I said I just need to rest a bit in some quiet. My husband went to go play a few slots while I went up to our room to lie down.  As soon as I entered the room, I was appalled.  Sure it was a smoking room, but it smelled like the room had been on fire or that the windows had never been opened.  I turned on lights and the carpets were stained and dirty, like not even vacuumed dirty, I could see things left behind on the carpet.  This was a small suite, so there was a \"living room\"  with a couch, chair, and dining table.  The remote for the TV had NO batteries in it, so could not turn on the living room TV and had some unknown stuff all over it.  The curtains were torn and stained, the window sill had stains and wallpaper was peeling in places. Enter the bedroom, the bedding looked clean and well made, more carpet stains and evidence of poor vacuuming.  The air vent cover was off and leaning against the TV stand, the remote for this one had batteries but no cover over them, and there's a little sign that says wifi is $11.99 per day.  The closet has more carpet stains and damage, the hangers are dirt, you can see old dirt and hair on them and dead bugs and dirt inside the light globe.  The bathroom looked clean with a couple clean towels, but the toilet had issues flushing. I text my husband this room is gross but I need to lie down.  I talked to the manager first thing in the morning, explained and showed pictures and she was shocked.  We were refunded immediately with mountains of apologies and promises there will be a housekeeping overhaul and some remodeling of rooms in this condition. I won't stay in the hotel again, no matter if we are first stay after a remodel or not, that was just pure gross.  The casino and restaurants were lovely though."}
{"text":"The grave yard manager Donna was not only unprofessional but arrogant and rude.  She shouldn't be greeting guest with her horrible attitude.  I would tell you to run the opposite way.  Poor customer service and no one could resolve an issue."}
{"text":"I had stayed at the other Arizona Charlie's location on Decatur on my very first trip to Vegas back in 2004, and it was great, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with the Boulder location. I am a member of the players club, which covers both Arizona Charlie's locations as well as the Stratosphere, and responded to a direct offer I had received from them which gave me an upgraded suite for the price of a standard room.  Check-in was very rapid, and I was especially appreciative of the check-in clerk.  I was having a problem with my debit card at the moment - it turned out the company had put a temporary block on it for suspicion of identity theft!  Fortunately, I got it all straightened out, and the front desk clerk swiped that card about 10 different times over the course of an hour without even frowning. That takes alot of patience - you don't often see much of that in the customer service industry anymore. Thanks again!  The property differs slightly from the Decatur location, as all of the corridors and buildings are outside vs. being enclosed. The decor of the rooms is a little more Mediterranean vs. Southwestern, as the Decatur location is. The suite (I believe it was a Standard King Suite) was very spacious, two televisions, extra cold air conditioner, very good water pressure, and lots of closet space.  The bathroom was a bit small, but no complaints.  This property was originally built as a group of extended stay suites that wound up going bankrupt, which might be one of the reasons the rooms are so big, and come with a good value.  The pool and hot tub area was small, but more than adequate, and not crowded at all.  The casino was great as always - lots of the newer multiline penny machines, but unfortunately, almost no old-skool 3 reels.  The Sourdough Cafe was teriffic. Be sure to check out the Steak and Egg special, it's one of the best, and has won several awards in Las Vegas magazines.    One thing to make note of is that this particular neighborhood is not the most glamourous - you'll see alot of drug dealing and prostitution from here to the Budget Suites a couple of blocks down the road.  However, I can't fault the hotel for this.  Overall, a teriffic stay and I'd recommend it to everyone. Remember, you won't get the glitz and glamour of the Strip in some of these off-strip casino hotels, but it's been proven that places like these are far superior in customer service and higher casino payouts. The room prices and friendly employees can't be beat. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Why a five star?  Because they treat their people right. I play and eat there. Alot! Unlike Sunset Station, I never had a complaint. Always great service. Workers there even know my name.  I play alot, and win more than I do at other casinos.  I love their comp system there.  Better than I've seen at other casinos.  Soon, I'll be trying their steakhouse, and I'll let you know about that then.  Thank you AZ Charlie's for making a local feel at home!"}
{"text":"We came once before and we decided to return because we like the 1 bedroom suite. The lady at the counter was so nice with us, nothing to complaint about the customer service.  The room was decent like before, not like a surgery room but clean.  The problem is when you decide to come during the summer when is hot and the air conditioning unit is not designed to work efficiently.   The room at the entrance were the main AC unit is located is really cold enough.  But the second room is nearly compared with the outside temperature. It have a little air vent behind a TV stand but you really don't feel any air coming out from there.  To have a little air amount on that vent we had to cover the main unit with pillows but was not enough. The room temperature was totally uneven. I had a terrible night!! Room cleanup came while we was here in our first day but they did not return. We found the room exactly how we left it.   Next time probably we will look for another place to stay."}
{"text":"If you like \"Locals Casinos\", AC's is fairly decent. There's a large array of penny machines for those who like 'em, and quite a few table games. The dealers are fun and friendly. Could use some more quarter and dollar machines, though."}
{"text":"Walked in at 3:45 with a big smile.  I had already been to Mr Mamas and had a great lunch.  Followed that up with a flat out fantastic massage at Best Foot Spa.  Best Foot Spa is right close to Lee's Liquor.  By the time I got to Arizona Charlie's I was set.  I was feelin' good.  Very good.  Check in was pleasant.  Major improvement at the Registration Desk!  It was such a welcome change from my last several visits, it put an even bigger smile on my face.    My King suite was a smoking room, so as soon as I sat my bags down I immediately started smoking.  I smoked and I smoked and I smoked.  It took a while, but soon I had a really good cloud going in the room.  I mean, it was so smoky it was difficult to see the big ass TV through the haze.  Clearly, there are few responsibilities as a hotel guest I take more seriously than my obligation to keep my smoking room smoky.  You smoke like that you gonna get hungry.  And that's exactly what happened.  But damn, by now I'm in NO condition to drive anywhere.  And I had a really good smoke going on.  I didn't want to be away from the room so long I'd lose the smoky momentum I had going.   As I always do in such cases, I lit a small fire in the wastebasket and then poured just enough water on it to put out the flames.  I sat the smoldering wastebasket in the bathtub and waited until the suite was completely filled with smoke.  That would buy me at least an hour or so.    I needed a quick meal, so Arizona Charlie's coffee shop, the Sourdough Cafe, was out of the question.  They're not quick.  I decided to try the little deli tucked away in the back corner of the casino.  Turned out to be a good choice.  The cheesesteak I had was pretty dang good.  And it was ready quickly!  There was still plenty of smoke in the room when I got back.  I like to think that when I checked out three days later I had made some real progress on the smokiness of the suite.  There's a lot to do in Las Vegas and I ended up spending a lot of time outside of the room.  Still, I know I left Arizona Charlie's a little smokier than I found it.  I'm good with that.  Mikey C says: where there's smoke...."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the security guards, because the criminals aren't. I stayed in the RV park for 1 month, my bicycle and shop vac (both chained up) were stolen.  Nightly gun shots in the area, and no shortage of police dealing with patrons in the park itself.   I've left a number of messages with risk management,  still haven't heard back.  With better security this place would be nice, but it's in a really bad part of town."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Our couch had a huge stain on it. The carpet was beyond filthy. Something was smeared all over the bathroom and vanity room walls, either blood, makeup or who knows what.  I would not sit on the furniture and did not pull back sheets to sleep.  They offered another room that was as bad if not worse.  We were stuck as we had been staying at a great hotel on the strip since Monday but needed to extend one day and due to several conferences we were forced to relocate.  Frankly I was horrified.  NEVER AGAIN.  Further, the entire place had a very unsettling feel to it."}
{"text":"Needed an inexpensive but decent place to stay for the weekend of EDC.  Our hotel room was simple and clean. The large living/dining room was spacious with just enough furniture for two. The furniture was somewhat scratchy and outdated though but I wasn't expecting much. The bedroom was big enough for a queen sized bed and a TV, although the mattress did not fit the bed frame very well. Sheets were clean, no bed bugs. Bathroom/bathtub all clean, no mold or cracks. The entire time we kept the AC at a 60 because temps were around 120 the entire time we were there. Basic wifi is free for up to 3 devices. If you want faster internet, its about $10 per day per device.  Service was fine. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We ate at the restaurants located inside the casino. They're cheap but the food was good enough to satisfy your hunger. Plus there are great Mexican places nearby to eat at. Location wise, this worked pretty well because it was away from the strip (wanted to avoid it during this trip) but super close getting to the venue for EDC. Security patrols the entire lot for most of the day because the casino's open 24hrs. The 2 ice machines near building 6 & 8 were not working at all times so there was no ice during the hottest times of the day (or for most of the days)."}
{"text":"Had a little hiccup with a dining over charge & I commented on the survey received. Guess what! within 24 hours I received a call and the Buffet Manager Debbie L. contacted me. We resolved the charge over the phone and were invited back for a VIP treatment at the Buffet. I am pleased to let otter patrons know that Arizona Charlie's does care and takes pride in providing the best customer service..   BY the way, I received another follow up from Ron C. the Catering manager to make sure all was good."}
{"text":"I really liked this hotel because of its location and price. I just can't give 5 stars for them because this hotel doesn't have free wi fi (they charge you in $12/day). Also, they don't provide microwave and refrigerator in the suites (I am sure that is because they want us to pay for food in their restaurants too) and also because its tooo noisy, I could hear what was happening in the room above. However, I really recommend this hotel because of its location (15 min from strip), cleanliness, organization and service."}
{"text":"Horrific hotel! Hair on bedding. Non-smoking rooms smell of smoke. Sink didn't drain. This dump is a refuge for chain smoking toothless gambling addicts."}
{"text":"Do not stay here! I found a junkies needle jammed into my bed of their delux room. Very ghetto I checked in and checkout within an hour. Very seedy and lots of scary people."}
{"text":"The hotel is actually motel style, but I'm not picky. All I ask for is a clean room with a comfortable bed, and that's what I got. The shower is an enigma to figure out, though. I stayed at Arizona Charlie's for an entire week and I left the place still unable to figure out how the hell the shower works.  Also, the in-room wireless never worked, but at $12.99 a night it's not really worth it anyway."}
{"text":"It was clean and quiet place to stay there. Clean room clean towel heater on . Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"What a nasty place. First thing I noticed was the nasty air when I got off the elevator.(I am healthy and have no breathing problems...I have been congested for three hours. I am not asthmatic or have any bronchial diseases...I hope I don't get it now!) Too much stale cigarette air. My wife was afraid to eat anything in the buffet. The gravy was 'crusty' from sitting too long. The salad dressing had a 'skin' (like dried milk or latex paint). Reminded me of an old run down retirement home. If this were the first impression someone got of VEGAS...it would be the last. Truly, just a nasty place."}
{"text":"First time in a long time at the buffet.  Its better but still needs work.   The fish was a bit dry.  The cakes were a bit hard.   I liked the addition of the ocean salad.  The service was good !!"}
{"text":"I went with a buddy and thought it would suck but just wanted a place to sleep that's CHEAP. Not bad place at all. Everything was clean. I had a car so didnt mind the drive to attractions and even found stuff on drive I would of never seen if I had stayed on strip. Basically a motel 8. Only disappointment was 11 dollars for wifi per day. My buddy had a ton of data and used his phone as a hot spot so didn't need to. If you just need a place to sleep perfect."}
{"text":"1 star is too much but since i have to put a star they get it by default.. This place is FILTY ! It is outdated, no wifi, rooms arent properly cleaned. We literally showered with shoes on and didnt want to sit down. We showered and checked out it isnt worth the stay at all SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. Motel 6 would be better than here FORSURE!"}
{"text":"Not that big of a selection at the buffet but the prime rib was good....the price is cheap and so is the food"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have stayed in a long long time.  At check in the desk lady was snotty because the only credit card i jave is a pre paid.  If I had seen anything on hotwire.com about needing a non prepaid card I would have chosen someplace different to stay. But there was nothing said about it until check in where I was told we would not be able to stay again or extend our stay unless we got a \"real\" credit card. Next morning had trouble getting room keys to work no big deal my daughter and I ran down to desk to get them fixed where we had yet another rude lady help us she actually rolled her eyes when I explained only one key would work. On top of that it's not even clean rooms  Under one bed found empty juice bottle with chew on it and hair in the shower. Still this is vacation so we let it all go and went out to enjoy are day before leaving out do not disturb signs on door came back to a freezing cold room and things moved around. Called front desk and even though the lady I talked to was nice she informed me staff can come in whenever they want and I got a notice with my keycard so hung up and checked and sure enough it says they can come in for maintenance, safty,security  and other purposes. Nothing needed fixed and there was no security or safety issues so guess coming in moving personal items around and turning air conditioning on counts as other purposes? Very disappointed with this place if I could figure out how to leave zero stars I would"}
{"text":"Went to Monster cup supercross at Sam Boyd stadium. Perfect for the event about a 6 minute drive. Hotel was clean my room was very nice. Hotel staff was friendly and spoke very clear english.  Prices were very reasonable.  I gave 3 stars only because no food room service. Love the idea too that the casino was not attached to the hotel. It was more like a apt. complex."}
{"text":"The quality of the Sunday brunch buffet has gone down hill. Loaves of bread other in wrappers for everyone to reach into without tongs, basket of donuts in front of toaster for everyone to reach over to toast bread, no butter on line anywhere for toast, chicken fried steak was dry and terrible.  Rest of the line was ok."}
{"text":"Rooms need additional updating. Pull out couch would be nice. Biggest issue is ac only in front room so king bed and bathroom area don't get ac unless door open the whole time. So my room was hot. Tub needed to be repaired. Bed hard. Carpet dirty."}
{"text":"Do not make a mistake on your booking or the hotel will screw you and charge you for a night even when you try to cancel the booking minutes later."}
{"text":"This is a simple, with basic frills.  The room we stayed in had two basic rooms.  We stayed with four people in the suite with a double and a king size bed in the other room.  The main bedroom had the sink right next to the bed which was a little nasty.  Each time someone had to use it I was sleeping right next to it.  He bathroom shower was always riddled with a slow clog.  It's to be expected with the price you to pay to stay there. It's really far from the strip so plan at least a 20-30 minute commute.    This place is nothing great but not horrible either."}
{"text":"This place is low priced. There was no resort fee, so the price on orbitz.com for my two night stay came out to $53.00 and change with tax.  It's not like many other places that entice you with the  low price in vegas, then in very fine print state a mandatory resort fee or internet fee must be paid upon arrival. (That is what happened during my last stay in vegas at one of the \"Station\" resorts, my resort fee was more than the actual room cost!)  The place is laid out somewhat weird, the hotel rooms are located behind the parking garage in what looks like a run down housing project. Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside was about as clean and maintained as a more expensive place. The notepad next to the phone (which came complete with some else's math equations) indicate that it may be owned or operated by the same people as the stratosphere.  If you are in Vegas for work, and not fun, it is a convenient place to stay, as you don't have to walk a mile to get to your vehicle. If you have a work truck of some sort, you can probably park close enough to see it from your room.  I booked the room with a single king bed, but was placed in a room with two full size beds....not a big deal for me...   (edited review on 07-04-12, to change \"palace\" to \"station\" as I don't want anyone to think I was referring to Caesar's Palace. I also didn't want to mention the name of the other place, as this review is not about that place, but I guess I just did!)"}
{"text":"I got a good deal for Our New years day vacation from Vegas.com.I Was a bit hesitant because the price seem to good to be true! $638.00. For 3 rooms (Dec. 30 2014-Jan.2  2015=3 nights) !! When we arrived the check in was fairly easy and fast.Out of the 3 rooms only one had a smelly carpet by the entrance of the room.I let them know about it and was immediately moved to another room without any problemFor breakfast we went to their buffet,which was also a big hit! The price was good i believe about $64 for 7 adults!! The selection was good not over the top but good.Specially the roast beef which actually had good flavor and the made to order charbroiled hamburgers and fries!! The desserts were good also.Overall a good place to stay will definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"BUGS!!!! YES BED BUGS!!!  I CALLED THE NEWS STATION. channel 13 in Las Vegas they confirmed there are bed bugs in all of the Hotels. The man even ask \"how I didn't know there were bed bugs in Las Vegas? And said everybody knows. Then mentioned what I wanted him to do?\" I was in shock. After everything We had been thur. I had such terrible experience in the Arizona Charlies on bolder hwy. I was in a tight situation. My car had broken down . A family friend recommend the Hotel. Clean and great value. So I booked Sunday night on one debit card, not knowing when my car would be repaired. The next day one of us got bit on the arm. We didn't thing nothing of it at first. Monday I found out my engine had to be taken appart. So when I got to the hotel I extended my stay till friday. On another debit card and ask the to put all the charges on the new card including sundays. Well no they could not do that correctly because they over chatged voth credit cards. Put to depoists hold on both cards. Leaving me short about 100 dollars. We sleeped on one of the beds. In the morning one of us was bit again but this time she caught the bug. And we call the front desk. Almost instantly they upgraded us a suite. The next morning we were bit  up all of us were covered in bed bug bits. At this point we checked out right away. This ruin my vacation!! I called to complain about a refund. WAIT ON A RISK MANAGEMENT TO CALL BACK. I WILL NEVER STAY IN ANY HOTELS IN VEGAS."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd and final update, after finally getting ahold of management and talking with them today they decided to comp my room costs for one night.. I thank them for that, the room besides the issues I had on my stay were decent and if you're looking for a cheap place.. go to motel 6 or something like that.  ------------      The 2 star review just became a 1 star... like noted my first day was an absolute hell here and I've been nervous since and even had a nightmare. The first day I got here and kindly told the front desk lady that I had recently had ankle surgery and couldn't walk far. She said she understood and would get me one of the closest rooms.   After getting my room number I went to go to my room, when I inserted my key it didn't work. I figured maybe I had a bad key so I tried both and neither worked. I called the front desk to contacted security and security told me that the front desk wrote down the wrong building and room number.  After finding the right room I went in and put my stuff on one of the beds and went to use the restroom since I had just been on the road for a couple hours. I went into the bathroom and after using the toilet I noticed blood on the ground under the toilet and right against the wall.. this absolutely freaked me out as blood can carry disease. I called the front desk and told them and they said they would send someone to meet me at my \"upgraded\" room.  One final update.. I went back to my orginal booking email and I had a double room with double beds.. why did they try to put me in a normal 1 room 2 bed room?   They claimed I was upgraded when I got the room I was supposed to have in the first place?????  So after going to my upgraded room and standing outside for 15 minute an security guard showed up and said oh I thought you'd still be at the other room. After this he let me in and went our seperate ways.   I once again put my stuff on the bed and went to Walmart when my friend as soon as he had gotten to my room. We went and enjoyed some in-n out and got some drinks and food at walmart, about 3 hours later we got back and I went to use the bathroom to only find the toilet clogged with used toilet paper and an handle that was \"loose\"..  I've only been able speak to the front desk and never have been able to contact a manager. The front desk however said that the manager they've contacted at home would be happy to give me $10 off my total purchase.... Seriously? I seen blood and now even had nightmare about it.. not to mention someone else's toilet paper and a clogged toilet isn't what I paid for.   The staff for the most part are friendly but it seems you'll never get a hold of an manager like I said I could've on friday.. seems they just never show up.."}
{"text":"My family decided to take a last minute road trip to Las Vegas. As expected it was extremely hard to find a hotel in one of the busiest cities there are. After a hour of searching, this hotel was the only one available at the last minute. Upon getting there and waiting in a very long line (minding you there was only one person at the front desk for the whole hotel) I was able to obtain my room key. After the family and I lugged everything upstairs we found bed bugs. Not only were there bed bugs but there was holes and stains in the sheet but the room had a horrible stench as soon as you walked in. Once I went downstairs to address this issue I was given another room but was unfortunately locked out of the old one which housed all of our belongings. Then the security came up to do a \"report\" which led to nothing but attitude. He asked about five times what was my name and I replied ever time what my name was, he kept saying I wasn't the one for the room. I tried talking to him but he kept rudely cutting me off, I then asked to speak with the manager of the hotel and he lied saying he was the manager. Later I found out he was not the manager of the hotel, not only did I receive attitude from your staff but I was lied to. My family trip was suppose to been fun and relaxing but it turned out to be horrible, not only for me and my spouse but for our kids as well. Just horrible customer service and bad room service."}
{"text":"Dump  I was scared for my life, You would be hard pressed to find a place more scary and sketchy in Las Vegas...  I had fun playing Bingo, but when we were leaving, I thought I was going to get shot as a police situation and manhunt was unfolding in the casino as i walk out the door I see two guys urinating in the bushes and one vomiting just steps from the police car...   My first time playing bingo since I was a kid, if i have to deal with this scene no thanks..."}
{"text":"Upon arriving we were greeted by very helpful and friendly staff... That's where our good experience ended at Arizona Charlie's Boulder. As we walked in our room we were greeted with the WORST mildew smell I have ever encountered. It smelled like the carpet was soaked with the juices of a homeless person and never dried. For a cheap hotel we didn't expect much so we sprayed some air freshener and gave it another chance. We woke up the next morning to find that the bathroom light doesn't work... I am currently sitting on the toilet writing this review... In the dark. So yeah, if you're thinking about staying here... Just spend the extra money and go to a better place, or sleep on the street. It smells better."}
{"text":"I travel to Las Vegas regularly -- two to four times a year.  I'm a poker player always looking for an edge.  The last thing I want is a luxury-priced hotel that cuts into my thin bottom line.  I prefer budget accommodations.  So half a dozen years ago I went with this property located about 6 miles away from the Strip, on Boulder Highway, just a little north of Henderson.  But I always rent a car and don't like the long lines of the large strip hotels anyway.  So this property's somewhat distant location was not much a deficiency for me.    The casino has a very nice restaurant, the Sourdough Cafe, with terrifically inexpensive specials , especially breakfast specials. The rooms themselves are well worn, acceptable in size if not spacious, and modestly appointed, with nothing extra -- no microwave or refrigerator (at least not in the standard rooms).  There is an outdoor pool on site but no gym.    The location is a step above awful -- that doesn't bother me at all.  But if I were a woman staying alone or a family with children I might give it some pause.  There are \"working girls\" who clearly frequent the property and the sidewalks near it.  But to the property's advantage are three large full-service and budget-oriented casinos: Boulder Station, Sam's Town, and The Cannery East.  The Longhorn Casino, home to many very inexpensive breakfast and dinner specials is also within a nice stroll.    The best reason to stay is the price -- among the very lowest in the Las Vegas area.  And, to top it off, THERE IS NO RESORT FEE!!!!!!!  All things considered, this is the best deal for an acceptably clean and functional casino hotel room."}
{"text":"I stayed here because it was on labor day weekend and i was attending my cousins wedding on the strip.  The strip hotels were over $200 a night so I could only afford a hotel in the $90 range on the weekends.  The room was big, nice, comfy, casino was good, resturant was good, free wifi.  The BAD PARTS is its in a sketchy hood. It's an outside hotel. Casino is seperate from the hotel.  It seems like a really trashy truck stop place, and i could hear the people having sex in the room next door, and I mean everything from the sound of the neighbors tv, toilet flushing to them having sex on the table. TRASHY!  I did tell the management and they gave me a refund of one of the 3 nights which was nice"}
{"text":"It took us 20 min from the airport to get here without traffic. The outside looks like any other grungy pink  motel but the inside is bad. I wasn't expecting much for $35 but my sink was clogged, there were toilet stains, and I couldn't tell if the sheets were stained or if that's a pattern. It's kind of far from the strip also. I think their hotel shampoo made my hair more oily.   Pros Cheap price.   Cons Cheap feel. Horrible lighting.   Would I come here again?  No. I'm sure I could find similar priced hotels closer to the strip."}
{"text":"RV RESORT REVIEW My wife and I stayed her for three days in April 2014.   First off,  we called ahead and asked if our four Chihuahuas would be a problem.  They said if the dogs were well behaved it would not be a problem.  So first positive,  while they say they have a two dog limit,  if your dogs behave they will let you stay with more.   Do not lie to yourself about your dogs behavior,   do not screw it up for the rest of us,   if your dogs do not follow commands and behave,  do not push the limits.     The pads are concrete which is nice.  Level which helps level the unit.   We had a 27 foot travel trailer and this was the easiest leveling job we ever had.   That is the second plus.    The dog run was OK but small.   We had to wait until those with big dogs to leave before we could take our Chihuahuas in.   I would have to say that is the first negative,   they need two dog runs,  one for each size.     Driving in was easy,   the turns were easy and  space was good.   I have recommended this park to a friend as a good place to locate,  close to down town and the strip.   I would say it is not so hot for families with small kids."}
{"text":"Stayed there looking for property this weekend. Right down the street from my son - so I've been here before but not to stay. Customer service and ease of getting the suite on the first floor was great. The suite area was very nice - lots of room. I always bring my slippers because most rooms have that crappy rug and you know people keep their shoes on and bring (stuff) in from the outside, bathrooms, other not so clean... Price:  great Noise:  none Bugs:  none Bed:  great - hige TV:  great Bathroom:  clean and functional Kitchen:  no mini fridge (that would be nice)   Overall - 4.5"}
{"text":"This is the 1st time that the Hubs and I have went to this hotel to stay for 4 days. Unfortunately it wasn't the experience I wanted.  I have never heard of a hotel that charges $11.99 a day per device for Wifi. Are you serious. The Hubs and I had to print out tickets for a Game we were going to the 1st night we were there, we asked about the Business center only to find out there want one but had this mini little computer to print. We got charged $11.00 to print and use the computer for 3 min.s. 1st strike.  When we got to the room, the card didn't work. Went back to the front and got new ones. From that point only 1 worked. When we finally got into the room it smelled like if someone had smoked Marijuana and if someone was in their 5 min.s before and had done the dirty. It was a bad smell. Strike 2. For the 1st 2 Days we didn't have any Hot water. On the 2nd day I went to call the front desk only to not be able to call cause the Phone was broken. I had to walk all the way to the front from the back. I waited 20 .min.s in line to tell the front desk about what happened. They called maintenance and said someone was going to meet there. When he got there the guy told me that they had shut the water off cause they had a issue. WTF no one couldn't tell us that. We didn't have any water for 2 days and you couldn't tell us there was issues. Strike 3. Than the topping on the cake the day we checked out we needed a few extra minutes to check out ( since it was 11am for check out). Someone came banging on our door ( we had slept in on accident after coming in late from the night before). I tried to call down stairs to the front and NO ONE answered the phone for 45 min.s . When I FINALLY got someone on the phone and woman name Rebecca answered with a nasty adittude and said that she will give us 5 min.s to check out and than hung up on me. I was done.. we packed up everything and went and checked out. I am Officially done with coming here. Never again.  Warning if you want to come here be prepared for anything but a good experience."}
{"text":"You never know what you might get for an off-strip place but the rooms were better than I expected. Cannot beat the price for what I got. The rooms were remodeled; I could smell the fresh paint when I checked in. It had new carpeting. Check-in was smooth and the staff was very friendly. The casino is small and seems to cater to locals. Very chill."}
{"text":"I was rolling over 3 stars but figured 2 would do it more justice. We spent 2 nights here and I tried to stay in the room as minimal as possible.   Review is for room only... its very rundown looking. Those flowery cheap curtains that match the bed sheets. Restroom was very confined. My car trunk seemed bigger. Not that I have used it as a restroom or so.   Aside from the room... everything else is just just average or below. Valet dude was polite. Insisted on tip even tho he never parked our car. Parking lot is pretty big, always found a good spot. Front desk guy was cool... however offered no help on whats going on ON the Strip as far as shows an attractions goes. FAIL!   2/5 because I have had MUCH better. Esp in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We rented a room out for a baby shower that cost $50. They provided tables and chairs, the rest was up to us. The room was about 30x50sq.ft."}
{"text":"I dont see why all the one star reviews. If u expect this to be the same as the bellagio you tripping. Its a cheaper option off the strip. We got a suite. The room was clean. I was happy. Pool was nice daughter loved it. Dinner buffet was good. No bed bugs. Didnt see any pimps or hookers as the previous reviews said. Lol anyways charlies isnt dead, yes we'd stay here again. Room 3302, the toilet is hella loose and crooked. And the sheet of linoleum in the bathroom is loose and coming up. Minor complaints. Charlies was cool"}
{"text":"Considering the location of the hotel in proximity to the Strip or Convention Center and the price, I did not have very high expectations.  However, it was worse than I expected it to be.    At check in the person checking us in was alone so she had to answer the phones continuously during our check in.   We checked in at 3pm so it there should have been another person there to help.   She must have stopped to answer the phone at least 6 times without once saying anything to us like \"excuse me, but I need to answer this call\" or \"I will be back in a moment, I have to answer this call' \". She just rudely turned away, and was not very pleasant to the people calling in.    We noticed mold on the walls in the bathroom, unfortunately it was in the morning when were were getting ready to shower and head out for the day or we would have asked to be given another room.     We ate breakfast at the cafe and I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak had a sour taste so I could not eat it.  I told the waiter but he did nothing.   It's safe to say that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.     Rude service, hazardous, unhealthy rooms, and terrible food.  Not one redeeming quality."}
{"text":"~7 years ago my family enjoyed coming here for he breakfast buffet. It wasn't bad, it was filling and better that boulder station. Then we started going to the other azc for the buffet-oooh they had funky card symbol waffles. Then it got worse and worse and a lot of things became cold and unmixed and we stopped going."}
{"text":"We checked in....AC did not work efficiently, it was 110 outside, rugs and sofa stained. It was not a pleasant room...Staff was pleasant,  we decided not to stay and I expect there will be no charge my card.  7/11/17..... Credit card statement came today and guess what they CHARGED me!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could take away the one star I gave them....SO ANGRY.... called my CC company to dispute"}
{"text":"Arizona charlies is dirty and disgusting. The buffet and coffee shop and steakhouse all suck. The place is filthy and smells. It's all garbage people that go there and there is no class there. That place is for white trash people and should be imploded."}
{"text":"Returned over the holidays and was very pleased.  Front desk was very very helpful over the 4 days and 3 nights, room was very clean and spacious and this is the best value for a room in Vegas I think (just over $40 a night with taxes Mon-Wed before New Years).  Buffett was good, virtually no lines.  Gambling wasn't very good, but that really wasn't hotel's fault, casino is not very big but is perfect size for a small property.  Security was always around, either walking or on bikes.  You can hear noise from nearby rooms.  I would still return."}
{"text":"Horrible hotel. Can hear every noise from adjacent rooms. Carpet had waves in it where it appeared it was coming unglued. No free wi-fi. Hotel registration staff were rude and unfriendly, as was most of the casino's entire staff that we came into contact with. They placed us on the entire opposite side of the hotel from the casino.  If you want to leave your room to go to the incredibly dated casino, you must safely traverse the parking lot filled with tweakers/homeless people. There is a homeless group that lives on the backside of the hotel. Not worth your time or safety to stay here."}
{"text":"Well rooms umm the suite had 2 beds Ava. Last minute trip to Vegas rooms where iffy there was a couch but looked dirty I used a blanket to sit down,bathrooms where clean, staff nice but the place looked like I was back in los angeles watts ..... people wondering about bums sitting around with there bags scattered, when I seen security riding around on bike made me think more than once. Place was quite but then again I was plastered so really passed out."}
{"text":"RV PARK, has a separate entrance. WiFi.  Pets cannot be over 35 lbs. NOT for us. $32/ night. $180/ week pull thru. Cost is up to $650 a month, including utilities. add 12% tax."}
{"text":"We were just passing through Las Vegas (not wanting to spend a night on the strip), so the hubby booked us into this hotel. Our room was on the third floor with an outside entrance, a good distance from the casino and the noise of the street.   Other than the carpet feeling a little gritty, this was an A-OK place to spend a night, especially for the price ($48). The bathroom was clean and the bed linens felt freshly washed. We parked the car in a spot that had a light overhead and a view of it from our room.   The bottom of the door had a crack to let in a draft but didn't let anything else in (critter-wise), which I didn't really expect being on the third floor. There was an elevator (stifling hot inside) that was handy to bring up the suitcases.  Free wi-fi worked fine and the location of the hotel was a plus for getting on the freeway heading to Phoenix the next day."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!!! I would like to point out that I grew up in a family that worked in the service industry (I was even a busboy at the age of 12) so I am very sympathetic when things don't always go as planned when dealing with any service industry. But this time I have to come out \"Guns a Blazing\" to help you avoid this dump.   1. Family Friendly: I would say NOT!!! We went as a group; 10 families for a softball tournament in Las Vegas. We were told we had to stay in this hotel otherwise we could not be in the tournament. (Letter of complaint to the ASA Las Vegas Tourney's on the way). This place is not kid friendly or even family friendly at all. The only location to go as a group to is the swimming pool. Even though you're as quiet as a ghost, security show's up to kick you out of the pool area promptly at 10:00pm. There is no other location for families (groups) to mingle unless you want to go to the smoke filled casino.  2. Room's: Bring your own cleaning supplies and leave the kids outside while you clean the room. The rooms were non-smoking and didn't have the dingy stale smoke smell many converted rooms had. We were in building #3 room 2312 and the floor (carpet) was filthy and in need of carpet replacement badly. The Bathroom needed a deep cleaning in all areas. The rooms in my building was actually two rooms a living area with twin size bed that sat 3 feet off the floor and the master room with a queen size bed right up against the sink....Yes I said \"sink\" that was in the master bedroom. It turns out that the bathroom is so small that they couldn't fit a sink in it, so they put the sink up against bed. So if your laying in the bed and it's time for someone to brush their teeth, your getting a shower. The windows in our room were so filthy you could barely see through it. The lighting in the room is very bad, so during the day you open the curtains for a little light and all you see is dried pigeon poop on the outside of the window. Not all the windows for all rooms were this bad...just mine, probably because it took a ladder to get to our second floor window and no one is that motivated. For some reason the TV in the living area was a tiny 22\" tube television and in the master bedroom the TV was bigger...don't ask me why??? The room air conditioner is seriously old school. There's a hole cut through the wall from the living area into the master bedroom with a pipe stuck through that comes out directly behind the TV in the Master Bedroom for ventilation. This thing is \"LOUD\" and rattles like a fright train. If it wasn't for 10 years of sleeping on an Aircraft Carrier, I would have gotten no sleep at all. Yes...I slept in the living area where the air conditioner is because my kids couldn't see the 22\" television or hear it because of the air conditioner.   3. Exterior of building: They use natural earth tones to paint the building...but I can tell you it's been many, many years since they painted it. Every wall in every location has black scuff marks everywhere you look. It's like they had fifty 7 year old's pumped up on pop rocks and cola riding bicycles without training wheels for the first time.   4. Pool: The pool is too small for the amount of people Arizona Charlie's can handle. I already told you they shut the pool down promptly without question (no one was even swimming in the pool). The first day we were there the pool needed a good skimming, but the second day when all the softball teams had arrived, they had to shut down the pool because the water became very cloudy. They drained half of it and then refilled it...it still look cloudy so we went to a friends hotel and used their pool.   5. Casino: Your everyday locals smoke filled casino. Crowd was mostly over 65 and lived nearby. I did have one of our parents win $1,000 at the black jack table on a side bet...but it took her 30 minutes to collect her money because the pit boss didn't know how to make the payout. All the pit boss could say was: \"no one has ever won that side bet before.\"  6. Restaurant: We ate one night at the restaurant (I don't remember the name). They were running a $15.00 dinner special we tried it and it was okay, nothing overly fancy and the food wasn't special at all. I will say that Tommy our server did an exceptional job and we really enjoyed his service. When my wife's seafood plate came out well overcooked like sole of boot when she asked for rare, he had no problem letting her switch to the beef dinner special. Tommy was great!!! the food was just okay.  We didn't eat in the Buffet, even though I was looking forward to trying the breakfast there. Prices were fair $5.95 for breakfast buffet (with players club card) but one of the parents put a bad taste in my mouth when she said; \"Look how they clean our rooms, are you going to trust them to cook your food also?\" Needless to say we went to Denny's for breakfast and I never saw the buffet line the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Really like most of the bartenders here. Very friendly and you don't have to wait long for a drink.  Not like some casinos."}
{"text":"Ok price.Old tv sets, poor cable channel selection.Hustlers for sex and loose change in the casino and parking lots. Seedy neighborhood. Casino smells of cigarette smoke. Dirty bar/lounge. Rude front desk staff.Homeless man took a bath in the hot tub one night."}
{"text":"Staying at the rv park. If there was wifi would have given 4 or maybe even 5 stars. Place is clean, excellent security, food is pretty good at the restaurant but order burgers well done or they will be raw in the middle. We talked to restaurant management months ago, burgers are still raw. We've stayed many times in the last few years, it's near everything we need while in this city but due to BAD or nonexistence wifi I won't stay here again. It's not just this visit the wifi is bad. it's every visit. I shouldn't have to find a ride to McD's or Staples or Panda to make dr. appts, check on my mother, let my son know where I am or do banking. Also no can/bottle/plastic recycling. They could donate the cans.  Don't like to bitch but feel like I have too. I mentioned to lady at desk months ago about the lousy wifi and she told me no one else ever complained. Not true, I asked many fellow rver's if their internet was good and they laughed. What internet they said.  Update on Rv Park: We got stuck in Vegas due to doctor's appts and are still staying here. The wifi sucks more and more everyday. Once we leave here we will never come back."}
{"text":"Wow ! What could I say about this place. I made my reservation here after I heard about the incident at the other Arizona Charlie's in Decatur and that was a big mistake. We got the room and the carpets were filthy . We had two beds and we noticed that they didn't have a top blanket like a comforter or Bedspread we called the front desk and they said the rooms don't come with it. That's crazy. The website pictures shows it. The customer service was terrible.  They bathtub made an awful cracking sound it was room 3509 We will not be staying here anymore."}
{"text":"It's partially my fault for selecting AC. We booked a last minute trip, and everything else was ridiculously overpriced for a hotel with a casino. For a Saturday night, we ended up paying $71.  First of all for you young folks, no young, sexy people stay here. If you want that, you'll have to cough up some dough and book elsewhere. Its mostly older folks and families. Maybe its my own fault for hanging out with people who work part time menial jobs with low pay. The cheapest rooms are OLD. No other way to describe it! They are old with a 9 inch box TV. No exaggeration. The walls are very thin, you can hear everything the neighbors next to you and on top of you are doing.   I did like that the room was at least clean, the shower and toilet worked properly, and the beds were comfortable. The rooms are separate from the casino, so if tobacco smoke bugs you that's a plus. The walk to you room from the parking is very close as well. The food is good, especially for the price ,it is a bargain. Get yourself a free rewards card and you'll get 10% off food. $3 Blackjack helps pass time as well.  I probably wouldn't stay here again. I wouldn't rule it out, but its highly unlikely, especially if I visit for pleasure. --------------------------  I forgot to mention that the staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Place is incredible!! Clean and affordable. Friendly staff. Except for the meat cutters at the buffet..is there a reason they cut the meats paper thin? I mean it isn't free we pay for it. After speaking with debbie tge asst manager of buffet she replied they changed company? Wtf?? I then suggested that they post a sogn above the meat section..\"KIDS MEAL\""}
{"text":"This hotel is so old outdated that's why it never makes big incomes, if this hotel owner was smart enough to remodel it and make it more modern style and nice new beds and floors and new restrooms then this hotel would make triple the ammount of income the nicer the hotel the more the guest it's common sense get this hotel updated or we will never return again please remodel asap to have our group of tour buses to bring you guests."}
{"text":"The place is everything I'd expect from an old Las Vegas Hotel. Good Price, moderate accommodations.  The area is like any other part of Las Vegas off the strip. Weird people walking around, but not crowded.  The room was clearly not designed for their current furniture layout. There was an entire wall empty that left a big void in the room. The room was big enough for a bunch of people to hang out or if you're room sharing for an event. It was decided in two with a for between the bedroom and living room kind of space. The room is dark with the lights on and the windows closed, but fine if you keep the windows open. I prefer the windows closed when I'm changing and getting ready in the morning, however.   The casino was typical, I guess. I'm not a gambler, but the thousands of slot machines looked the same as every other casino. I don't know if they have table games.  It smelled like smoke when you walk in. It's ok I guess. You get used to it.  The restaurants are ok. I bought one of their specials for $5 burger and fries from the cafe. I've had better for $5, but it's an ok price for a quick bite on a budget. The party was thin and the burger had no special flavor. The fries were very standard and typical too. They needed some salt.  The service was friendly. Front desk check in took about a 10 minute wait with a 5 minute process. I called the operator from my room and she greeted me courteously by name with a quick answer to my question."}
{"text":"Can't really give any casino five stars because, let's face it, they are out to rob you blind.   This is for the Cheesesteak Grill. Some of the best tasting, best priced cheesesteaks in the city. And now they have a few new offerings. Mmmm mmmm   Only negative, the will not sauce your wings. Boo.  Un-sauced wings?  I won't eat them."}
{"text":"I cannot say about the rooms, but from the view from outside, dark and dingy... the slots here are pretty tight and usually can find a $5 table, not today, wtf? They have no progressive bonus to justify having $10 pai gow table, plus its the only pai gow here, i guess i play at eastside more for that bet, since their progressive is well over $200k, worth playing for.. They continued to be like this i ll just go play some where else.. Its way too smoky to stay and play anyway.. The food is ok, reasonable, lots of old folks local hangout..The staff is ok, its hit or miss, depending on who you deal with, sorry to say i don't consider one of my favorite casino."}
{"text":"I prescheduled a post wedding dinner on April 6, 2014 for 24 guests at the Yukon Grille located within Arizona Charlie's Boulder Casino.  Some of the reviews suggested that it is located in an unsavory area of Las Vegas but our entire group found it quite acceptable.  A quick walk through the casino took us to the restaurant on the second floor.  I had read that you should not prejudge the Yukon but wait until you had experienced it for yourself.  Those reviews were \"spot on.\"   It boasts an elegant, quiet, subdued atmosphere with an extremely competent and friendly staff.  Our visit was pre-coordinated with Debbi Lewis, their Food & Beverage Director.  She greeted us when we arrived and had two large tables waiting for us.  She kept close eye on us the whole evening to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves and that we received everything we ordered.    Tom was our very knowledgeable and friendly waiter with assistance from a young lady.  (I was negligent and forgot to get her name).  The food was perfect and instead of delivering individual meals they used a two tier cart to deliver our soups, salads, and entrees to everyone at the same time.  I am a very picky person (my wife says \"an anal retentive perfectionist\") so I want everything to be right.  To go a step further, if I go to a restaurant and their restroom is not top notch, clean and well kept I usually do not go back.  I feel that this is an indication of how the restaurant management attends to detail and feels about their guests' total experience.  The Yukon restrooms were excellent to the point of being elegant.  Since I selected this restaurant for 11 of our family members and 13 of the bride's family (whom we had never met) I wanted this evening to go perfectly.  Debbi and Tom made sure of that.    The thing I dreaded most, after setting this up, was the post meal plebeian ritual of everyone putting in 80% of what they think they owe and the sap who collects the monies (ME) gets to pay the shortage out if his own pocket.  To eliminate this hassle Debbi offered, and provided, separate checks.  Last but not least Debbi scheduled taxis for our return trip to our hotel.  Some of us were parties of five so Debbi had to make sure that the taxi dispatcher sent vans and not cars.  I know this has been a long review but when I am the recipient of an \"over the top\" experience I like to reward those who provided it.  If those who rated the Yukon anything less than 5 stars they should check the sign on the door because they were NOT at the Yukon."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came into town and stayed here. We couldnt beat the deal we got on expedia including the flight. The room was exceptional. Had a Couch and Bed and Tv in one room. Then the other room had a bed and tv. The buffet isnt the biggest but the price is good. Loved the Cafe and Shortcake and steak was good and a great price. Security roaming around kept things quiet. Not far to the strip. A 7-11 is right around the corner. Played in the Bingo hall and had a blast. Will recommend all to stay here who dont want Strip prices but a great place to lay your head and eat. The pool was fun too."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Someone broke into my uncles room while he was sleeping. Security knew who it was and didn't catch the guy. My kids were afraid to sleep alone. Staff didn't seem to care to much.  We had quite a few family members staying here cuz there was a death in the family. There was also someone trying to go thru the window of my other uncles room."}
{"text":"This is the first time my family and I have stayed here and it will definitely be the last! Housekeeping didn't come in to clean the room, make the beds nor leave clean towels. We have stayed Downtown at The D, Palace Station ,we stayed at Boulder Station and at Sam's Town and their service is 10 times better than this place! My daughter and her family also stayed here, the 1st time she had ants in her room but they quickly gave her another room and were very apologetic so she decided to stay here again but now this time her room had roaches!!!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE STAY HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've stayed multiple times at the RV Park over the last few years. The WiFi never works nor does the so called cable tv. The cable once was great. They've since changed providers & it's worthless. This trip, when trying to sign on to WiFi, I kept getting wrong password message. Went to office to ask if this was correct password or if there was a different one. The lady stated I had the correct password & that too many people must be using the WiFi at the same time & password on the paper is correct. Maybe a little time should be spent looking into the WiFi to see if something is wrong or if hacked. So for a week & had to use my data plan that I used up so my provider charged me $15 more on my monthly plan. We pay $$ to stay here & to use the amenities. I'm tired of paying for things that I can't us. The dumpster aren't in the enclosures. The trash company dumps the trash, leaves trash on the ground & dumpsters in streets. You would think that AZ Charlie's would have a team that would go around & clean that up & put dumpster back in enclosures. Then said team should go around to make sure spaces a clean & ready for next guest. The RV Park office people used to be very nice. Now they're basically rude or just don't give a damn.   The last year or so I'm not feeling very safe. In the adjoining neighborhoods every single night there's multiple gun shots (not RV parks fault of course) but I'm terrified a stray bullet could hit an RV in here & I don't want it to be mine. Not an exaggeration   This WILL be my last time to EVER stay. I doubt anyone one from AZ Charlie's reads these reviews nor cares how people feel about paying for amenities they can't use but it makes me feel good to yelp & let others know how it truly is."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas a few years ago, I had to wait a few days before I could move into my place.  And, I didn't want to stay at the Budget Motels... for obvious reasons.  So, I looked into hotels near my place and ended up choosing AZ CHUCK'S.  The hotel is not attached to the casino.  It has a small pool, which I didn't use.  The room I stayed in was actually pretty nice.  It was a one bedroom suite and it was quiet.  That is all that I was looking for when I ended up staying here for that time.  The Casino over the years has seen some renovation.  It is a nice little place with its' clientele being an older crowd spending their retirement money.    They have a couple of restaurants upstairs, The Yukon Grill, Sourdough Cafe, and the Buffet.  Downstairs they have a couple of fast food places.    My reason for checking into AZ Chuck's was to go to the Sourdough Cafe.  So, you can check out my review there if you like."}
{"text":"We spent three nights in Las  Vegas! THE westgate 4 two nights,supposed to be at Az Charlies for  one more, luckily we cancelled one night of Arizona Charlie's Boulder we tried to cancel 2! I won't get into that story. We arrived it took an hour and a half to be able to get to our room as a disabled person it was a nightmare the bugs I took pictures and movies of but I stopped and erased them because I decided we were moving on to a five star hotel in Newport Beach and I just want to keep moving forward luckily we only spent one night in this hell-hole it was disgusting grotesque and a lot more vile words that I could say! stay far away from this particular nightmare I lived 20 years in Vegas it happened to be a holiday weekend but I would have rather have slept in by car disgusting is an understatement vile and disgusting dead bugs dirt grotesque falling apart need I say more I think not"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. Only reason it's a 1 is because they at least refunded me one night. I had reservations thru Vegas.com & apparently they over booked my room. I got there Friday night at 10 & by midnight someone tried to barge in our room bc they had the same room ?!! & access as well?!! My kids woke up screaming !! So I run to Check and the person left. Come 2am security comes banging on my door like they're the police asking me for Id bc the room Was for someone else ?!!! So now my whole family is woken up twice & security is checking to see why my door key opens a room that's already been booked ?!? They literally Check 3 other rooms & my key opens them! Long story they wanted me to change rooms but then realized it was their fault! The rooms are filthy and on one nightstand it looked like a crack pipe burned thru it!! I asked for non smoking room & nope that also didn't happen. I would NEVER go here again."}
{"text":"STINKS and SMELLS like a mixture of an old folks home and dirty carpet (before you even get to the door)!!!! Why not change the carpet for once?! This place is nasty and the parking sucks!!!!!@@@"}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet offers a good selection and is reasonably priced. The service this morning was excellent. I go here 3 to 4 times a month and will continue. Omlettes and eggs cooked to order and fresh made waffles. Under $7.00."}
{"text":"There was so much wrong with this hotel I just don't have the time to write it all down I will just down load the horror - Check in no valet no one there to show you what and where + the room wow front door did not close right? big gap you can see the out side??? + the plumbing was so loud it woke me up many times + the carpet may have never been cleaned + 7 channels only? + no wifi + bad beds and bad furniture + no light bulbs in the lamps and the one with a bulb did not work the closet has never been cleaned I am sure of that + I don't think there was any insulation in the walls. do not go here it is cheap but not cheap enough and the casino is so out dated we did not even try it.,.,.,.,."}
{"text":"If you are thinking about staying here, don't do it! Dirty. We checked in late, and the main light bulb was burned out. I called in the morning and when they changed it I almost wished they hadn't. We could now see the dirty red/brown splatter marks on the walls, and the white splatters on the wall that you could only hope was a snotty booger. It looked like there was a bullet hole in one of the walls. The tv remote was sticky and grimy. The light switch in the bathroom was so dirty it makes my skin crawl just thinking about it. Then you think at least they have a pool you can escape too, think again. The pool water was so cloudy, you couldn't see the bottom of the shallow end, not to mention my flip flops stuck to the pool deck with ever step because it was so grimy and gross. If you don't have to, don't stay here."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a 1 star because I can't give it a zero. The buffet was half empty and their servers weren't clearing empty tables to get people seated. We stood for almost 20 minutes waiting for a table in an almost empty buffet. When the staff was asked about it they just shrugged their shoulders and didn't even try to hurry. Absolutely ridiculous!! Avoid this place at all costs!!"}
{"text":"First time staying away from Fremont or the strip. We went back and forth with here and Sams Town, and picked here cause our friends ended booking their rooms at a pretty decent rate so we joined in.   The rooms are very basic, but overall clean. I was upset that there was no safe so carrying around all my cash makes me nervous.   It's a little sketchy outside but no one bothered us.  We didn't eat at any restaurants so can't review on the food.   Casino was boring and I lost money.   We went to dinner at sams town our last night and was kind of bummed we didn't stay there when it was only $10 more a night, oh well... I know now."}
{"text":"Arizona Charlies I have to say we have come here several times over the years to play here as well as go to their restaurants.  The casino is a decent size. Being a local and having a players club card you get specials mailed to you,   When playing in the casino you do get free drinks, It is considered to be a locals casino because it is so far from the strip.  We have never stayed in the Hotel, I hear the rooms are pretty cheap if you need one. Remember you get what you pay for and if you want to be near the strip this is not close at all and it will take a bit with traffic to get there."}
{"text":"On the one hand; the staff was nice, the room was good for the price, and the rooms aren't attached to the main casino- it was nice being a bit apart from all the dinging slots. On the other hand; woke up at 7 am to pounding on my next door neighbors door, and an officer yelling \"SECURITY, OPEN UP NOW!!!!\". I couldn't tell if the people hanging around the place we're homeless, or guests ... everyone seemed to be in some stage of inebriation or undress ... but then again, it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Pros, Cons, then summary  Took my family to Las Vegas to watch the Monster Truck World Finals.  I was not in town this time to do the typical \"Vegas\" thing:  clubs, gambling, nice buffets, etc.    PROS--Only a few miles from Sam Boyd Stadium.  Near some good fast food joints (ex: In-N-Out, Sonic, local joints, etc.).  The hotel was cheap, probably the only reason for two stars.  The shower had good pressure, and the toilet worked fine.  One huge pro was that the AC was a newer model and worked very well.  It kept the room at a constant cool temperature and was cold our entire stay.  Ice machine worked well too.  Because the neighborhood was a bit shady, they had bike security 24 hours, and they were nice and professional.  More importantly, the security was visible at all hours and seemed to take pride in their job.  CONS-- Very dirty rooms.  The floor was filthy.  We basically had to wear flip-flops in the room because wearing socks, or no socks, would turn the bottoms of our feet black.  The TV was state-of-the-art if it was 1991.  Old box TV.  Also, we had to call the front desk because it didn't have a remote.  (On the plus side, they did come in a few minutes)  The pool was rather small and dirty for a place this big.  I didn't do any gambling but did spend some time scouting the casino for future reference.  It was as others have described....old retirees, elders, and other odd people.  The neighborhood is shady.  Don't plan on walking anywhere after sunset (unless you have a CCW). There are numerous pimps and prostitutes up and down Boulder Hwy.      Would I come back here?  Probably not, unless all other places were booked solid.  I'd trust a Motel 6 or Super 8 over Charlie's.  It's only redeeming value is if I ever plan to go to Sam Boyd stadium again.  Otherwise, if you're looking for the \"Vegas\" experience, this is not it.  Too far off the strip and no real nightlife."}
{"text":"We went in for the steak and shrimp advertisement that was posted outside but it was so smoky we couldn't even go in and stay. We went upstairs to the buffet it looked ok not very many selections though so after dealing with the smoke and the not so plentiful Buffet we decided to take off"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here, room was cheap and clean, that's all I could ask for and the service was really good and over the phone with the reservation was perfect for me. In the casino, the drinks are really watered down, so you might as well ask for a glass of water. I was not expecting to win any money here. I came here because my neighbors recommended it and I could park my car outside my room and keep an eye on it. Really good stay and I stayed for a few nights."}
{"text":"Well for me Arizona Charlie's was a little difficult to find because for some reason the GPS just kept falling off in this neighborhood of Las Vegas. The facility itself is really dirty on the outside and clunky. You almost feel like you're in the ghetto. As you leave the parking lot and come up to the registration desk it feels like an unsafe place. People at the front desk were were nice and helpful. The room was well just barely okay. The internet is 12 bucks per day per device. Not good for my taste. I slept well however I must say I sleep well everywhere. Yes, there were people outside yes they were talking loudly and yes it didn't bother me because I went to sleep. For those who sleep lighter this would have been very distressing. There's an acute lack of plugs for anything. I guess I'll say who cares I just checked in and went to sleep and got up and left. Off to find another hotel for the next night. Another Adventure in hotels, I will not repeat."}
