{"text":"Livin Lite came to our business location, and my co-worker and I were thrilled to have a healthy option among all of the other food trucks.  I ordered the crab quesadilla which came with a slaw side.  When I received my order, I was so excited to take a look that I fumbled the box and dropped everything on the ground.  I returned to reorder, and the food truck owner refused to take my payment even though I was insistent.  The crab quesadilla was amazing with a lot of crab and a not too spicy chipotle type mayo on top.  I would have happily paid for it twice.  Thank you, Livin Lite for supporting our local growers and for serving an underserved segment of food truck goers."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this food truck when I saw them! I am pescetarian (vegetarian plus seafood) and thought this would be awesome! I looked at their website and saw that they had mostly healthy meat options and some vegetarian/vegan option. It was nice to see they had some gluten free options too. 

I picked out a couple things on their online menu that I was considering getting. When I went to the food truck I was very surprised to see that their rotating menu that they mentioned online meant they only had 5 options! And only one available side (coleslaw) which I was not a big fan of. And the 2 soups that looked good on their website and the \"crabby patty\" sandwich that I was considering we're no where to be found! 

They also didn't list any prices online either which I was disappointed with. All of the food trucks I have gone to always have their prices listed and an updated menu with a decent amount of options. So I was disappointed to say the least.

I ended up getting something they didn't have on their online menu which was a crab quesadilla which was pretty good. I love chipotle sauce so I was excited about that. The food was good but the only thing I would say is that it didn't have a lot of cheese. And it's a quesadilla lol. It did however have a ton of crab meat! Maybe some people would like that but would have preferred gooey cheese with some crab meat in each bite. I would think that would lower food costs for them too but oh well. 

I think updating their website with that weeks menu would be helpful and set better expectations for people. Prices would be nice too."}

{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  This was my first experience with a non-cheese, non-fried, non-white bread food truck and WOW!  I am so glad I decided to stop.  I had the Ramona Burger on mixed greens, and it came with complimentary cole slaw.  The burger was delicious, I would eat that instead of a regular burger any time.  I can imagine how delicious it would have been on a bun!  I only have 2 complaints - the coleslaw had \"Asian\" dressing but had no Asian flavor whatsoever, and there were only 2 sunflower seeds, and secondly their prices DO NOT INCLUDE TAX so don't jump up from your desk with only a $10 bill in your hand!"}
