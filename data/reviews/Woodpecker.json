{"text":"We like the bibimbap and chapjae here. Their other dishes look good too.  Usually order takeout but you can eat at the food court and they provide proper utensils and stone bowls (ie, not plastic utensils etc.)

Free soup and side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts and sweet potato noodle).

Good price, good value, good portion, and most important - very tasty!"}
{"text":"Inside Metro Square, more specifically the food court. There's only a total of about 5 food booths, so it's not hard to find. Tons of seating though and parking!

I ordered the beef bulgogi, while my boyfriend had the pork bone soup. 

It's what I expected from a fast food Korean place, sweet not really fried enough bulgogi. What I did like though, is whatever juices are floating at the bottom the fluffy rice soaks right up, making the dish so much more tastier!

I had a bit of my bf's pork bone soup, and througly enjoyed it. 

If you've ever been to the T&T at Middlefield/Steeles and had the Korean food there, it's EXTREMELY similar to it. If someone were to put they're two foods in front of me I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Right before we left though, we saw a gentleman order pork bone soup, BUT, with ramen noodles sprawled on top. We for sure are going back to try that!! I also want to try their Royal Rice Cakes, which look tasty as heck!

I gave this place a 4 star rating, because it's not really anything special, though better than most fast food Korean places."}
{"text":"This korean fast food restaurant is tucked away in the Metro Square food court. I stumbled upon it one day after running a few errands in the plaza. 

The prices are decent for a food court restaurant. I've tried their bimbimbap and jajangmyeon combos personally. It comes with hot tea and sides (kimchi, bean sprouts, etc). I wouldn't say this is comparable to any of the larger korean chains (Owl, Songs cook) but it does serve as a good alternative in the food court it is situated. 

Overall, would recommend if you want a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Something changed... the kitchen staff and cashier are different than before. Looks like an ownership change.

And so has the taste, portion and the side dishes included. The taste was so bland, compared to before. Where's the glass noodle side dish!?

Was highly disappointed with my meal here a few days ago and won't order again unless I see the old cook and owner back.

Will trek a little further for my Korean soon tofu & bibimbap craving."}
{"text":"Wrapping up a visit with a client and stopped by Metro Square to see the offerings.  Saw Woodpecker and their advertised pork bone soup for 7.50  taxes in.  The meal includes a huge cup of rice, banchan, and hot tea.  The soup flavour was very nice with 3 large pieces of meaty pork bone that was cooked to perfection and had nice flavors.  The potato inside was nicely infused with the soup flavour.  They also provided me a buy 10 get the 11th pork bone soup free card.  May have a few more visit is here to try the tofu soup and LA Kalbi offerings."}
{"text":"Woodpecker is located inside Metro Square's Food Court serving Korean Food. 

Price is quite reasonable with Pork Bone Soup starting at $6.50 which includes a plate of banchan, a bowl of rice and a cup of hot tea.

Our Soon Tofu (choice of Pork or Seafood $7) has a lot of pork and tofu but it was either spicy hot or bubbling hot. Maybe if you like Spicy, you need to request \"Korean\" Spicy.

Frequent buyer's stamp card gives you a free order of Soon Tofu after 7 purchase. Not bad if you eat here often enough!"}
