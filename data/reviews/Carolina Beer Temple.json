{"text":"Great little place in downtown Matthews.  The selection of Belgium and domestic beer is great. A bit on the pricey side , you can get some of the same stuff  at the wine store at about 20% less. Great place to relax although if you're coming after work you may not get a place to sit due to the size of this place."}
{"text":"Decent little tap and bottleshop. When I was in there they had some nice Belgium's on tap. The prices were a little high, but I know they run specials often. One thing I don't like is they charge a corking fee if you buy from their cooler and want to drink it there. That makes sense if you were bringing in your own beer, but to buy from them and for them to charge you to pop the top seems a little short sighted on their part.  I haven't seen this at the other places around Charlotte (Good Bottle, Harris Teeter, etc...).  All and all, if they got rid of this petty fee I would have rated it higher."}
{"text":"This place is great! Will was awesome and great to just chat with! I want this place to be closer to me! Will definitely be coming back! Thanks for the awesome beer and the awesome time sir!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, fantastic beer selection; both on tap and off. One of my favorite hang outs :-)"}
{"text":"Just moved to Matthews & sooo glad that Carolina Beer Temple is right down the street!  The store variety is great & I love that they have tap takeovers to change out what's on tap frequently.  Great idea & will be visiting often!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite craft beer store to visit, they always have rotating beers- it seems almost daily, so you always get to try something new from the local breweries, which I have yet to try one I don't like! Their staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is laid back, I usually come to do homework or hangout with friends and play one of their board games! Also you can bring your own food or order there from surrounding restaurants which is a major plus!"}
{"text":"Wanna try a new craft beer but don't want to commit to a whole six-pack? The brewery scene isn't for you? Then this is the place for you. Don't know if you like beer?  Don't know what beer you like? This is also the place for you!  Only like Budweiser, Miller Lite, or Schlitz?  You sure?  Then go up the street."}
{"text":"What can I say? Ultimately hands down one of the best bottle shops I have ever visited. The owners are awesome and knowledgeable of all things Craft Beer. 16 taps of local as well as imported suds. Rob always seems to have a good imported Belgium on tap at all times. So happy to have this place near us. Please give them a try. I guarantee you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Great drinking place for beer drinkers. Even if ya just wanna hang out on your media device and do whatever yu do on it. Playin Great music today. I'm Drinking a Dirty bastard ( not dirty martini ) from Founders in Michigan. Wow great stuff !"}
{"text":"The beer selection is excellent, as you can probably guess from the name. I ordered a Belgian-style tripel, it was $12. The beer was good, and the workers were friendly. They have Trivial Pursuit cards scattered about the bar, so you can pass the time with a game.   There is very limited seating in the bar area, and they close pretty early. Still, a nice place to grab a drink with friends or spend some time on date night."}
{"text":"The place is relaxing the beers on TAP are good. Friendly service makes this place A+"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to enjoy beer in Matthews, and likely all of Charlotte.  The taps are constantly changing in this intimate coffee-shop style temple.   Great selection of bottled beers but even better are the new beers they bring in every day/week.  Tap takeovers every Thursday/Saturday, First Thursday art festivals, Run Club Tuesdays, and a slew of other events keep this place as a great gathering place among locals."}
{"text":"Great location and a nice selection of local and craft beers. An ever changing selection of beers to choose from on tap. Even more in the bottle. They have a nice area to sit with cards and trivia. They don't have food but you can bring take out in from surrounding restaurants.  They have a very large selection of specialty and craft beers for take home too."}
{"text":"Hidden beer pub in Matthews with wide variety of beers on tap, bottled selections, changing with the seasons. You can get food from nearby delivered too. Small tables that would serve about 40 people so it's a quiet vibe."}
{"text":"I always recommend this place to people I meet that enjoy craft beer. The selection is ever changing and the employees are friendly and helpful when it comes to picking one of the 16 fine brews on tap. The Temple is a great place to bring your laptop, read a book, watch a game or catch up with an old friend. Outside food is encouraged and there are many fine restaurants in the vicinity that you can call in and pick up. If you don't have time to stay for a beer they have a very large take home inventory. The Carolina Beer Temple is one of my favorite Matthews businesses."}
{"text":"Here are all the ways this place is great: Lots of beers fresh on tap. Taps rotate constantly. Half pints cost exactly half as much as a full pint. Owners/staff are friendly and will learn your name after a few visits. You can order in food from great restaurants in the vicinity, such as Royal Cafe and Creperie. Parking is super easy. They let you sample before you buy. It is okay to bring board games and play there. It's a really pretty and comfy place."}
{"text":"A bottle shop in Matthews! whoohoo!   I am obviously very happy about that. No longer do the fine people of Matthews and Union County have to make the trek to the other side of Charlotte to go to a fine local bottle shop. It is definitely filling the void we have had in this area since the closing of Total Wine.  The location itself is in downtown Matthews, In Matthews Station across from Beantown Tavern. There is patio seating outside. I would describe the inside as being open, comfortable, simple, and obviously clean. The atmosphere is as inviting as the owners are. The inside consists of a small bar with about a dozen beers on tap, a lounge area with couches, chairs, and a couple tables, and then racks filled with brews from all over the world. There is also a small refrigerator with cold brew available.  There was a wide range of beers available on tap. Including local brews and specialty brews from around the world. I typically drink a lot of local beers, including Triple C and Noda, so I wanted to try some new brews. I was excited to see a couple of high gravity Belgium beers on tap and decided to try both. I was a very happy person needless to say. The owner told me that the taps will change on a regular basis. The bottle selection is vast. So if you can not find something to drink there or buy and bring home then you probably don't really like beer...  They do not serve food, but while I was there, the crepery next door delivered some tasty looking crepes to some other patronages. There is also a Thai restaurant and a subway next door. So I am not sure if it is okay to bring in food or not but it did not seem to be frowned upon by the owners."}
{"text":"This is the best boutique beer place I have been to. Great guys, nice ambience, cool music and some awesome craft beers!!! Jordan was awesome and made the right recommendations... don't miss it if you are in Matthews"}
{"text":"Quaint, fun place in downtown Matthews with a huge craft beer selection that you can't find at the grocery.  Perfect for a quick drink or two or to meet friends and socialize. They had a huge selection of beers in the cooler and on the shelf as well as a nice draft selection.  Owner was extremely nice!  There is a run club on Tuesdays also.  Support local, drink local!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers to go, and an ever changing selection of beers on tap! Hey, for a local yokel place they are doing a great job. When I head out for a beer I just tell everyone I am going to church."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Can be a little hard to get some of the bartender's attn, but they selection is great, and the atmosphere lively."}
{"text":"Not that I'm an avid Matthews goer, but.....FINALLY! A place to score some local draught (and select bottles) of local/craft beer in the area. Bottle shops seem to be popping up around Crown Town as of late and I say the more the merrier. Spreading the love of a good brewskie is just what the doctor ordered.....for everywhere. Glad to see Carolina Beer Temple on the scene and doing things rather well.   The interior is rather cozy. Plenty of cushy seats, giant stools for the bar, \"temple-y\" decor, and some of the cleanest shelving/stocking I've seen to date. Move aside, Total Wine. I love the giant throne that they have along the far wall. Makes me feel like a king or something.   The owners are cool dudes with an equally cool and dude-ish story. Get to know them. They're great to chat with.   Local draughts abound -- Four Friends, NoDa, Birdsong, OMB, etc. Hopefully some Free Range and Ass Clown beers will make their way down their way, too.   Excited to see these guys grow and keep the beer flowing for the Matthews area!"}
{"text":"Yes! Highly recommend this place for anyone who loves craft beer, or just looking to try crest beers. It's like a coffee shop hangout, but for beer!!. The nearby restaurants will deliver food, and you can just relax and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Really happy I found this place after moving from Atlanta. CBT is right downtown Matthews. The shop is 50% beer market and 50% taproom. Was surprised on the variety of craft brews. CBT carries a lot of NC beer as well as unique craft brews from all over the country. They don't carry what they consider to be large craft breweries such as New Belgium or SweetWater.   My only issue is some of their retail bottles, especially bombers are generally $2-3 more than Total Wine. Another complaint is if they only receive a small shipment of a rare beer they might let their staff buy it all instead of selling it to customers."}
{"text":"Uber knowledgable about beer. Utmost friendly staff. Clean establishment. Fantastic beer selection. Premium tap list that is constantly rotated. Really, what the hell else could you ask for? The one employee Russ is a bit sketchy, but heck, even he's ok in my book. Can't recommend The Beer Temple more highly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer and a good selection of food from nearby places. Can't lose."}
{"text":"Friendly relaxed atmosphere. Beer selection is very good. Large local and international selection. We ordered Crepes from next door and had them delivered while we relaxed over beer and cider."}
{"text":"We love the Beer Temple.  Its the first place we found when we moved here 4 years ago.   The beer-tenders (we love you Will) are  attentive and very knowledgeable.  The selection is always changing but very good and diverse.  The atmosphere is cute and cozy and full of people with a common interest...Beer.  Its still my favorite Friday hangout"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place -- what a great surprise! Have been to numerous quality tap rooms, breweries, craft beer stores with bar in the Charlotte area, Ashville, and California, and Carolina Beer Temple is right up there with the best. The atmosphere, look, and vibe are excellent.The bottle selection is outstanding, but cost more than comparable places for single 12 oz. The tap beers are thoughtful, varied, and can keep a craft beer lover happy. Bar staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. I highly recommend and plan to return often."}
{"text":"My husband and I were invited here by some friends to unwind the day after Thanksgiving.  It's about a 30 min drive from our place but we are always game to try a new place. My husband doesn't drink beer but he found a delicious root beer in the cooler that he was pleased with. I selected a seasonal IPA from the menu and then went back to the cooler and picked out a green apple lambic that hit the spot!  They let you, and encourage you, to phone in food orders from anywhere you want. Our friends ordered pizza to be delivered and we got Thai Taste from around the corner. Go check it out! Pretty cozy and there is a TV there, too, which probably has a game on most nights."}
{"text":"Nice Beer and wine place next to each other.... Can't beat that!! It's a cool places to come and hang out with family and and friends or some one you meeting for the first time.... And just a walk down the street they are restaurant you can grab something to eat.....enjoy life a little"}
{"text":"Cozy little spot in Matthews to try a new brew whether you grab and go or sit and sip.   Stopped in with my brother to check out the selection and ended up having a couple of beers. I had The Prayer from Burial Brewing that I enjoyed. Brother tried a sour that he really liked and another type of beer on his 2nd round. They have a decent mix of local brews and from all over the country (categorized East and West Coast). Kind of has a coffee shop vibe with the seating. You can order takeout/delivery from nearby restaurants. Beer prices are slightly higher than grocery store ($1-2) but I would expect it from a niche shop like this."}
{"text":"This is great place to find micro beers. The staff is knowledgeable and very friendly. I always have a great time there and will go back often."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. They even have a Sour on tap; 1st time I've seen that in Charlotte area! To top it off you can grab some grub from the awesome restaurants around them - I recommend the Creperie!"}
{"text":"Great place to get tons of locals beers on tap.  Super friendly and knowledgeable staff and a beautiful craft beer selection.  They also have fun trivia cards around the store to help keep you entertained.  It gets pretty busy, so claim your spot early!"}
{"text":"Nice little place for an afternoon glass of beer. They have some really nice glasses to drink beer out of, makes the experience better. Over friendly wait staff. They may have been the owners.   Next time I would sit out on the patio. Looked so cozy out there."}
{"text":"What's up with parents bringing their kids to a bar! This visit,  the parents sat at one table and sent the kids to another.  Great selection of beers,  good service and decent prices."}
{"text":"So originally only gave this place a 4* rating but after it has been open now for about a month(and I have gone religiously), I have gotten to know the owners and also gotten to know beer even more as well.  This place is awesome, and will continue to be a weekly ritual for me for quite a long time!"}
{"text":"Small but fun place to grab a few beers and hang out with friends. Located in the cute downtown of Matthews and surrounded by other places to walk to for fun. They offer several beers on tap including cider. Also tons of bottled beer. Food can be brought in from neighboring places or delivered."}
{"text":"I came on a beautiful afternoon for a quick sip, plenty of quality brews on tap. Service was excellent, but was put off by the disgustingly large ash trays for smokers on the patio outside. It was also dirty. Totally ruined the experience."}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte, two things needed to be addressed... church and beer. Conveniently, I happened upon Carolina Beer Temple and was immediately won over far before settling on a church. And since crossing that bridge in 2012, CBT's remained at the top of my go-to drinkeries, followed closely by South End's Sycamore Brewery, NoDa's (North Davidson) Dog Bar and Dolce Vita, Uptown's VBGB Beer Garden, as well as the German Waldhorn Restaurant in Pineville.  In the literal heart of Matthews, CBT's situated alongside other mainstays in a nicely arranged downtown complex. While any coffee or wine needs can be met at Dilworth or Black Chicken respectively, CBT fits the bill for EVERYTHING beer. The sheer variety of craft beers will have you sipping on a cold one or two for no less than a couple hours. I'd become one with their social media to catch any specials/updates.  Accommodations might be expected as one can tell from the complex's exterior that interior space will be substantially less than any of CBT's South End counterparts. No worries, however -- find a handful of tables outside. And if it's just not happening for you, Beantown only a few steps away is a solid alternative [if TYPICAL beer fare is all you're seeking].  The folks at CBT, both staff and customers, are extremely chill and welcoming; it's impossible to feel like an outsider among such a crowd. And should you have any questions or concerns, everyone behind the counter is knowledgeable and helpful.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I absolutely heart this place. Great place to have a beer and chill with family and friends."}
{"text":"Great shop and great selection.  Awesome tap list of local beers and  regional brews + Belgian and European beers.  Not a bad place to hang for a bit in Matthews.  Wish they would ditch the drop ceiling and harsh lights."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Staff had me in and out in like 20 minutes with an excellent selection. Dunno how much wine experience she had, but she made a recommendation and it was on point! Very happy! Thank you to your store and your associate! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh yes they did open a new beer shop right next to the wine shop in Downtown Matthews! Yay!  Carolina beer temple has a huge selection of bottled beers from around the world. Some are available from their beer cooler, so I imagine you can stay to enjoy it there if you like. There are also maybe a dozen beers on draft - from unique imports to our local QC/NC breweries. They offer all the drafts in a small-medium-or-large size, which is good if you'd like to create your own sampler.   Inside there are some tables, chairs, a couch and seating at the bar - there's also a small patio with 4-5 tables if the weather is nice.  The owners are very friendly and happy to chat and help you make your choice. I do hope they decide to extend their hours, I think 9pm closing time is too early for the weekend!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of drafts at their bar, good atmosphere and tables to enjoy the evening with friends, and a decent selection of bottles for purchase.  The bottle prices are on the expensive side, and the up charge on singles over six packs makes me want to try less things. Wish they had a bit more shelf space for other selections but what they have is a good start. Overall a good place to hang out with friends but not the best for filling my beer fridge."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been meaning to drop in for a while. We got the chance to go after the Belk Bowl. My first impression is that it is a warm and intimate place to have a beer. Good lighting and great music. They host lots of different cool events. They have some pretty good beers on tap - heavy on the Belgian stuff in general and the high alcohol content stuff. You can buy six packs/bottles or there are two refrigerator sections where you grab a beer and they add it to your tab. They encourage you on the blackboard to order take out from some of the great local places to eat. Restaurants can deliver it to the Beer Temple and you can eat while you sample beers (we had Thai food). The staff is very friendly and ready to make suggestions based on your tastes. We had a blast and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey , what the heck downtown Matthews is getting very popular. This is a great place for a beer emporium! You can buy or drink! Lots of lively people and the beer assortment was great! Service is good, it was packed the night I went but there was a beer takeover by Wooden Robot Brewery which is one of the very favorite in the Queen City, so that accounts for the way over crowding on a Thursday Night.  They also have a Mead on tap most of the time which you dont find in alot of places.  Try it...you will like it!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if you live in the area and you have a disposition for good beer, you MUST try this place out.  No food there, but there are food choices around.  Mindful of that, just come in, grab a pint and then do a little craft beer shopping to your hearts content.    I made my first stop in last week and was pretty impressed by the rareity of some of the beers and the bountiful selection of some of the more decent ones.  The service was more than happy to help pick out something to try and the atmosphere in general was very relaxed and nothing like say, a Total Wine kind of experience.    They have bar seating if you like as well as some high top tables and also some lounge chairs to help kick back and take it all in.  This place is nice."}
{"text":"A better name would be beer heaven as I don't think there is a place with as great of a beer selection as this place. There is literally something for everyone, every mood and every season.   I think the only downfall is they close fairly early but the manager didn't rush anyone out at closing.  I do not live near Matthews or I'd be a regular but I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A great place to grab some good beer and sit and enjoy them there. Friendly staff. Great selection."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for Matthews.  It's quaint, but lively at the same time.  Love that you can get food there or bring in/get food delivered from the nearby restaurants.  Feels as much like a gathering place for locals as much as it does a bottle shop.  I'll be going back here often."}
{"text":"Matthews scored big with the opening of the Carolina Beer Temple! I do not know much about beer, besides that I like it, and I am willing to try different kinds, and Carolina Beer Temple is perfect for that! They have a very wide selection of local craft beers, and beers from around the world. If you are like me, and are unsure of beer terminology, just have a seat at the bar and the owners will be happy to explain the different beers to you and let you try them out.  This beer heaven is nestled in historic downtown Matthews. It has a relaxed atmosphere, great for meeting up after work. Just come by, grab a chilled beer, and hang out on the patio. Feeling like royalty? Skip the patio and have a seat in the throne they have on the far wall. Hungry but in the middle of trying a really cool beer? Call one of the restaurants nearby and they will deliver the food (or you can pick up and come back with it to enjoy more beer). The variety of beers they have will keep you coming back to try something new! So excited to have Carolina Beer Temple in Matthews...just want Matthews needed!"}
{"text":"Someone should have mentioned that this bottle shop thing was going to catch on - it's like they are everywhere. Though others (Good Bottle) are fancier or larger, but perhaps not as fancy (Bulldog), the beer temple can hold its own, because they have crammed nearly every available surface with shelving to hold all sorts of bottles for your perusing pleasure.  Though it's probably not a reason to go, the best thing about the place is that you can order crepes (or other food) from nearby and have it delivered so you can both eat and drink right there. Sweet."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good beer emporium and here it is in the heart of Matthews. I came here with some friends and the staff was kind enough to reserve us a table. One of the bartenders, Justin, did a great job listening to the kinds of beers I liked in MI and finding me ones that I would like from NC. I love that they have free samples because it is really important to try before you buy an entire glass of beer. I was impressed by the numbers of beer on tap, the knowledge of the staff, and the amount of bottled beers for sale. I will definitely be bringing my husband back!"}
{"text":"When did Matthews get so cool? Where was all this when I lived walking distance?  I love The Black Chicken, but now that there is a crepe place and this amazing bottle shop next door, I could spend an entire day here without walking more than 15 feet.  I heard of these guys from my friends at The Chicken and followed their development on Facebook until they opened the doors. The owners actually recognized me and knew my name on my first visit!   With a focus on local beers (NC/SC), there is plenty of space at the marble bar and lots of sofas and large tables to enjoy your drafts. Speaking of, they have a lot of taps going with a nice variety. Lots of local and Belgian beers (the genres I gravitate towards...I think they opened just for me). They are getting some cool stuff in, too, like a recent small-batch collaboration between NoDa and Mother Earth. Talk about awesome!  Then there is the retail area, with shelf after shelf of delicious bottled suds, again with a local focus. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and just as friendly, and will gladly talk beer and point out a few for you to try.  Needless to say, I'm a bit of a fan. With this trio of goodness on the same side of the street, it is worth the drive back to Matthews for some good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We out here fools!!  John Meeks out here, Hampton here with me, Zach here, Jordyn here as well!!"}
{"text":"A friendly place to have a nice beer in Matthews. A great place to find a hard to find beer in town."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Very knowledgeable staff. Was great assisting me in finding the right beverage for me. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a nice bottle shop in Matthews NC - they have several beers on tap a limited food menu, and the option to order in food from other nearby restaurants.  They had a lot of great bottled beer available to drink on premise or to go.  I try to stop in and stock up my sisters refrigerator each time I visit her in NC, so I can enjoy a few good beers while I at her place."}
{"text":"I always have a good time every time I come here.  The staff is friendly and always extremely helpful.  They are knowledgeable and able to answer all questions that I may come up with.  They have a wonderfully large selection of beer both on tap and in bottles.  They also carry meads and usually have at least one on tap, which is pretty unique to the area.  They have light snacks and sandwiches.  They also allow you to order from surrounding areas to bring food in.  They have card games at the tables, and it really is a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Great selection and always able to have a sample before you buy. Limited table space so come early!"}
{"text":"Great laid back feel and phenomenal selection. Kind owners and awesome atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow, there's a lot of beers here. Most of which I've never heard of but that's ok, gives me more reasons to go back & try new ones. Stopped in this newly opened local establishment in Matthews the other day and was impressed. There's a nice bar area along w/ a few tables & other seats as well as a nice choice of craft beers from North Carolina & beyond. I partook in a Triple C's Smoked Amber on draft while I checked out the beer selections. Took home a Port City Porter (7.2%) six pack, a little pricey, but tasty. Glad to see this place get opened up."}
{"text":"If you're a beer connoisseur this is your place! The beer temple has an ever changing tap list of local and foreign beers, \"tap take overs\" and specials, and a hefty selection of individual bottles of beers and meads to go. They have an always running special of 10% off 6 bottle beers to go, and frequently have local brewery stickers, koozies etc for free at the register. The owners and staff are EXTREMELY friendly and make it a point to remember you and greet you like a friend after only a visit or two. They frequently support local charities and even their music playlist (a variety of rock) is on point! If you're in the Matthews area (as I said) this is *the* place for a drink!! :)"}
{"text":"Bright light in a developing area. Stupid amount of options and knowledgeable folks to help you. Been here 3 times now because it's so far from my house but always enjoy my time. Tables, lounge, go-to as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely dig this place. Great atmosphere, knowledgeable bartenders, and always a great pick of local craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Excellent beer. Excellent music. What more can anyone ask for? They had a great tap lineup, and an even better retail beer selection. The bartenders are extremely nice and helpful. We discussed NC beer and Michigan beer at length. Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places! Great and friendly staff with a high level of knowledge and willingness to both sample and teach, great cozy atmosphere in a perfect location for ordering in from several yummy food spots. Always options on pour sizes and the ability to grab a bottle to go or to drink in (though the corkage fee is a bit much). Unparalleled selections of mead as well and emphasis on TRUE craft beer."}
{"text":"Great little find for anyone who loves beer and even if you don't you can find something you'll like with the awesome selection. Nice tap list, refrigerated selection for small tap fee and many, many other bottles.  Very small food menu but they are completely ok with you bring food in and even provide menus from many of the other restaurants from right around the Temple. Friendly/very knowledgeable staff, so if you need help picking something out, just ask"}
{"text":"A spot that the south Charlotte/Matthews area sorely needed. Carolina Beer Temple is just the place for folks looking for a bottle shop or bar to belly up to. With craft beer six-pack bottles galore, a thoughtfully curated draught list, and several chilled offerings for one-off enjoyment, Carolina Beer Temple strikes the perfect chord for the Matthews contingent.   I wouldn't be surprised to see this become a popular location for events or just an after work beer. The night I visited, they were donating all gratuity to Relay for Life. Seriously?!? They haven't been open very long at all and are already giving back to the community. I can stand behind a place like this.  I look forward to returning the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Matthews finally has beer!  Well, not really-i'm sure you could find a beer somewhere in Matthews, but the Carolina Beer Temple makes a cool place to hang, try some local brews, and have an altogether great time if you are a beer connoisseur.  Located right off Main Street in the same block where the town hall/library and other shops are, the place is a great addition to the shops around downtown Matthews.  There were a couple of outdoor tables with umbrellas which will be perfect for hot summer nights, but when I visited the weather was not quite cooperating (rain).  It gave a us a chance to hang out inside though.  You can sit at some high tops, lounge on the couch, or sit at the bar, but you still get a nice relaxing atmosphere in order to taste some pretty kick ass brews.  I'm not sure how many they have on tap, but the menu is a good selection.  The back half of the store has shelves and racks of growlers, 20oz bottles, and six packs of beer.  So come in, enjoy something off the tap, or come get your beer to enjoy from your home.  Rob the bar tender was super friendly and made an effort to learn your name.  He checked us out via iPad and my receipt was emailed to me (horray for saving some trees!)."}
{"text":"After spending 3 1/2 hours waiting for my car down in Matthews, I needed a drink or two.  Carolina Beer Temple was on my bookmarks list so I made my way here..  The layout is great.  There's a bar inside the door on the left, several tables and also more comfortable seating on the opposite wall.  Bottled beers for purchase are in the back.  I sat myself at the bar, as usual, and checked out the menu.  Every style of beer seems to be represented on the tap menu.  There were a few local options and then some from across the country.    The staff was knowledgable and friendly.  And they have bottled beers here that I have not seen and the other bottle shops I visit.    I can't say that I'll come back here often being that I do not live out this way but I will surely make a stop whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"SO thankful we found this place, it's our new favorite date night spot.  It is everything you could ever want.  Knowledgeable staff, clean place, great spot to sit and chat, indoor and outdoor seating, lots of great restaurants around that will DELIVER to you, or you can pick up what you want and bring it in!!!!   Perfect spot for those looking to try some amazing beers, and stay away from the loud drunk crowds."}
