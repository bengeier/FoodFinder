{"text":"Scottish themed, hence the name, however the owners are definitely Asian!

The food was good, bit slow to cook and not particularly busy but it tasted good. Chips were good. 

My only criticism is that the fish batter was too light.

Would definitely go back again. 

Cod and chips was around $9 with tax"}
{"text":"Best Haddock and chips in Durham if not Ontario :)
Husband and wife team are super friendly and always remember my order every time I walk in. Have tried other places out of convenience but always come back to Balmoral. Fair prices too. 
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The best place in ajax for authentic fish and chips. Added bonus is the availability of mushy peas!"}
{"text":"My family are British background so real fussy about their Fish N Chips.  I thought I should write a review as they have sent me here a few times to pick up Haddock and Chips.

- Fish is crispy and fresh (almost a cross between Tempura and British Beer Batter)..has a nice texture (not too greasy)
- Chips hand cut and fresh made

The place is busy and has things like Mushy Peas, Blood/Black Pudding/Haggis/Iron Bru etc.  There is a little restaurant part of the establishment.  

If you are British and like a good plate of Fish N Chips that is closer to the stuff you get back home - this is the place.  I have tried other places in Ajax and my family have given those the thumbs down (as they just didn't make the cut)

Balmoral is consistently fresh fish, crispy batter (NOT soggy), chips have a nice texture and hand made, busy place and on weekends you may have to wait a bit for your order to be processed - but worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's the night out with my 9 year old niece & she wanted fish and chips. So I drove up on Bailey's and found this little place called Balmoral Fish and chips. I had to admit I wasn't too keen about trying it but was greatly surprised. Yes it's a fried Halibut but it was good.  Do ask for Emely she's a sweetheart with a great service and a huge smile. It was really worth it"}
{"text":"Really loved the fish & chips!

We ordered the haddock and halibut and they were both delicious

They use a tempura style batter that's light and not too greasy 

The fries taste like chip truck and were great!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chip place that I've ever had, batter is light and fluffy. Have gone to this place ever since I was little and has always been the best."}
