{"text":"Today was my first time at this location... The reason I have not been to this location is because they do not carry a full menu. I rather have a sandwich than salad. Therefore, I always go next door to Clover Joes, which has the best subs in town!  To be honest I don't think ill be back to this location. Why? 1.  Customer service is awful One o the girls working today could not hide her face expression on how much she was hating her job... 2.  They don't offer a full menu 3.  It is a very small location and it did not smell so well in there...  Pros: I had the small  flank steak  salad and  it was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Okay so not to be critical but they make salads. Are they really good salads? I would say they are good. Mind blowing not sure about that,   A couple things I liked. If you add a meat of some kind they grill it up fresh and that is great. I got salmon one day and it was very tasty. The ingredients are fresh as well and hey since it's a salad that's pretty important.  Where they fall short is the lettuce is not chopped up enough and so you are stuck trying to cut up these giant lettuce leaves with a flimsy plastic knife and fork. Not site where their lettuce comes from but it's like something out of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. Serious salad monsters.   Second the people making the salads are what I can only describe as intense. I realize they are busy and in a hurry but as the joker would ask - why so glum? It just isn't a good vibe. I mean sorry your store is way too small for the hordes of people that try to jam in there but not really my issue.  That brings us to number three. The place is small. Too small for the crowds they get. Hopefully they are going to move into the old Quiznos location a couple doors down. I mean seriously they almost need crowd control. If you like cozy well you'll really like it. No place to sit it is to go only.  So would I go there again. After three visits I'm going to have to say no. Line is too long, the person on the grill is always behind, and well I want my lunch from people who can take 5 seconds to smile and be thankful that I'm supporting their business.  So summary. Salads are good as long as you are okay with a few quirks. I'll wave at you when you're in line while I head down to metropolitan or Valhalla.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very good salads, meat is grilled to order so it's hot & fresh. My only complaint is that they have seven different types of Vinaigrette but no Blue cheese dressing ... I guess it's not bourgeoisie enough... IMO Cobb salad needs Blue cheese Just Fresh is nearby (Wells Fargo Atrium) and is an economical alternative if you're looking for a salad-meal, but their meat is not cooked to order."}
{"text":"I used to go here frequently when they were at their previous (much smaller) location.  The salads were always fresh and delicious.  I have been several times at the new location and the quality of the food seems to have diminished.  The lettuce looks like it has been there for days, especially if you go early and are trying to beat the lunch rush.  The last time I went there was a hair in my salad.  Needless to say, I will not waste my money here any longer."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and has become my new favorite healthy lunch spot! You can customize everything and they grill up the meats right on the spot! They have salmon, chicken, pork, shrimp, steak, and tofu for proteins.   Huge portions and about $9-10 for a super filling salad. As mentioned, the line can build up around lunch time but they do push people through fairly quickly, so it isnt too bad.  There isn't any seating inside. However, there are alot of chairs outside and tables in the park across the street."}
{"text":"Tossed salad with various types of protein, good for the vegetarian, pescatarian, or non-tarian eaters.   There's a long line during lunch so you'll definitely have to wait for your salad but they are very efficient and quick!   I got a custom build salad with salmon topping for a little over $10. They gave me two filets too! You get 5 toppings for no extra charge.   The veggies aren't the freshest of the bunch but better than D&D salads. Good place to go for a healthy, protein-filled lunch.   They're also expanding to meet higher demand!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy but seemed to handle the crowd just fine. Only downfall is that they do not take orders over the phone, so if you are grabbing a bunch of orders for the office, you'll have to wait in line and be \"That person\" who orders for 10 minutes. They also don't offer sandwiches at this location after 11? The menu doesn't state that, so again, if you're taking an order for the office, be prepared to only send them one section of their menu to choose from. SALADS ONLY."}
{"text":"Beware of bugs! The salads have many topping choices and can be pretty good, depending on who makes it, but I would watch out for BUGS in the salad! Today I ordered my own fruit and nut salad variation and about 3/4 of the way through it I found something that didn't look right, so I picked it out and wiped it on my napkin. Upon inspection, I realized it was a small, dead bug. Needless to say, I won't be returning! I have already emailed the company with a picture and am awaiting a response."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for months and I liked it... However, I saw TWO bugs in my salad today and I'm so disgusted.... I first saw a black bug of some sort, then a lady bug on the spinach, both in the same salad! This is ridiculous and I'm never going back again.... Ughhh"}
{"text":"Crisp is a staple for our lunch stops.  Great salad and meat choices.  I highly recommend the park loin salad or adding the grilled shrimp to any salad!  The only downside is the price as it is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Crisp is pretty solid when you're craving a salad. They have tons of variety to choose from and ingredients to appeal to anyone. I enjoy adding crumbled blue cheese and their roasted red peppers along with steak and spinach to my salad. It is made to order so the steak takes time to cook. It's not sitting there in a container.   If you go for lunch be prepared for a huge line and difficulty finding seating. The prices are a little up there, but it's appetizing nonetheless."}
{"text":"Salads are tasty -- of course they are, the lunch line is 30 minutes long. But they're pricey, too. And I'm not sure you're getting the most bang for your buck here. Ingredients could afford to be chopped up smaller. The staff is also clearly not super happy to be here, but that could be because they're slammed at lunch and probably don't get any breaks during that time.   A previous reviewer was on the right track when suggesting that Chop't would be a good model here, because you get more goodness for the same price as Crisp. They could consider a frequent customer card to make people feel like their money is better spent.   I'll probably be back soon and often because there aren't many healthy and delicious salad options in uptown, but Crisp should beware if someone else comes to town and offers yummy and healthy food at a better price."}
{"text":"Salad potions are pretty big and huge. It's challenging to cook fresh salmon during busy lunch hour but it appears they aren't fresh cooked everyday. I wish they fix this."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go if you're looking for a quick lunch that includes a couple vegetables. The salads were fresh and filling, yet uninspiring. The range of topping options was surprisingly limited, and there were 0 unique or even premium type choices. Dressings were not bad, but basic. The wide array of protein options, all grilled by the order, were certainly a redeeming quality though.  Overall, Crisp's salads are a decent deviation from a typical sandwich, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I normally go here and get a salad or the Monterrey wrap. Today, I ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it was a huge mistake. The turkey is pretty much heap lunch meat. DO NOT GET IT!"}
{"text":"Got the Crisp Cobb... quick service, great environment, clean.  My chicken is really dry and there's hardly any tomatoes.  I shoulda gone with the one with the steak in it."}
{"text":"Great salad. I recommend the Chinese Shrimp. The shrimp is seared and cooked to perfection. If you're there for lunch during the week it gets packed around 12:15"}
{"text":"Not again! Smell wasn't good as I entered the place. The lady who prepared my salad was wiping her sweet with her arms&shoulder. Ordered the special, grilled grouper salad, I paid and waited by the grill. 3-4 orders were delivered to the people who placed orders after me and then I realized that grouper was not even on the grill yet! I asked the lady about my order and she said \"fish take longer\". I didn't want to start an argument so I kept quite.  After all, the salad wasn't good and the grouper wasn't cooked enough. Terrible."}
{"text":"Moving from the West Coast, it's hard to find a good salad here in the South that is meant to be a meal.  The girls at Crisp, Annie & company, do a tremendous job.  it's great to go somewhere that w/multiple locations doesn't matter where they see me they know my name.  The salads & sandwich specials are interesting & show a creative flair."}
{"text":"A refreshing and varied take on salad offerings, which is not that plentiful, in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Got the special, Chicken Wrap with corn salsa on it and pasta salad as a side.  Good food overall, not spectacular.  Everyone working there was really nice, no complaints."}
{"text":"Good stuff for healthy diet. Salmon grilled salad is very good and it is cheap too I got this for 10. Line was long but fast at service. Good place for lunch in uptown."}
{"text":"I love the F.C.N. salad with chicken. My company usually orders in Crisp for meetings, so I never actually go there... til today. Even though I have my go-to item, it was still a little intimidating walking in because, as other reviewers have noted, the minute you walk in, it's your turn to order.  The staff operate as a well-oiled machine, firing off questions as you walk down the counter, which I mostly knew the answer to but I was still a little overwhelmed! Thankfully it was a rainy Friday, so there was really no line at 12:15 p.m., and I got my salad pretty darn fast.  The salad itself was delicious, but the bread chunk it comes with it always a little underwhelming. It was $10.99 for the salad without a drink - not too shabby."}
{"text":"So I was recommend to come here....after reviewing the menu I selected a flank steak sandwich...I was told they could not make this at this location...that's fine...I ordered a turkey wrap...and as my side I wanted a side salad.... It clearly states on the menu that this is an option...the lady told me that they do not offer it at this location...I proceeded to check out and asked for a water cup...I was then told they only have bottled water and there was not enough room for water cups?!  Not sure why they would advertise a menu that is not available at a certain location..have a menu for this location if it is to small to make a full menu...extremely disappointed for a first visit..."}
{"text":"12:30p and the line out the door is not too bad. Wait was less than 8 minutes to order. Person taking the order is multi-tasking but is listening when asked her to go east on the dressing. The person at register was quick and smiled as I paid. My salad was ready less than a minute.   I had the special of the day- turkey bacon apple salad in an apple cider vinaigrette. Romaine was cut chunky. Abundance of turkey wheels, large bacon bits, sliced toasted almonds, sliced apples, and blue cheese. Dressing was not too tart either.  Cost: $10 and some change.  It's a good filling fresh salad. Service was just fine.   Next time I forget my lunch, I'll come here, unless I find a place where fresh salads are a bit cheaper in price."}
{"text":"New spot right in Latta Arcade!!  This is a popular lunch spot during the week.  It is standing room only and take-out only.  There are standard salad options or make your own!!  That is my favorite!  I have tried several different proteins including the shrimp, pork tenderloin and the tofu.    All proteins are sauteed up fresh for you while you wait.  Prices are very reasonable - about $9 bucks for most salads.  Comparable to Dean and Deluca any day - size and freshness are very similar (but Crisp is cheaper!!)  Get there early - a line starts to form inside.  You will love it!  This is my new favorite Uptown lunch place.  Grab your salad here and head to Romare park or to the atrium to sit and people watch.   :-D"}
{"text":"If you're new to Latta Arcade, it's not hard to find Crisp during lunchtime..it's the place with the really long lines. The salads are pretty tasty and they give you a good amount of food so it might seem expensive but for the amount you get, it's not so bad"}
{"text":"What's the fuss? Crisp is great. Tucked away in Latta Arcade is this hidden gym and if you blink, you may miss it. What you cannot miss around lunchtime is the line at Crisp, generally an indication that there is something good inside that people find worth waiting for. I find that the line moves quickly, but you can expect to wait 15 minutes getting your food from the end of the line to leaving. This location only has takeout and barely enough room to stand. That's the only downside.   When you walk in, it's your turn to order, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. This is a salad spot. You can choose from one of their salad options OR you can make your own. If making your own, you're given three choices of a base, romaine lettuce, spinach, or an arugula combination. I always get the spinach and it's always fresh. Next is your protein. Your choices are chicken, salmon, etc. Your protein choice is yelled to the guy on the grill, who makes it then and there. Then you choose up to five toppings for the salad. Last, your salad dressing. There are about 8 to choose from. After you've placed your order, you pay and find a place on the wall to stand and get out of the next man's way. Normal price is going to be around $10 (including the salmon that I always get).  I have found the staff to be friendly. However, I smile first and always know what I want. They get really busy around lunch, so don't expect too much hospitality as their main priority is keeping the line moving and getting you in and out rather than make you feel wanted. My personal favorite is spinach w/ blue cheese, corn, craisins, garbanzo Beans aka chick peas, and Balsamic Vinaigrette. While I love bacon, I have found theirs to be hard. The olives are quite tart. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I doubt the line out the door that can be seen every workday lunch rush is due to the food.  The salads are okay, I guess, but they're nothing special.  They don't even really chop up the ingredients, so you're left with a $9 salad that has paper plate sized pieces of lettuce that fling dressing all over your shirt.  The portions are pretty large, so maybe all these would-be healthy eaters justify eating a 5lb. salad because it's health bacon, egg, and salad dressing on there.  3000 calorie salad?  hell yes!  that thing's loaded with veg.  The worst violation I saw, was a mass of obviously old (and looking rather slimey) mushrooms.  Cmon now - with that demand, you have to be the freshiest of the fresh.  Maybe the line out the door is for the display put on by the saladristas?  It's like watching German efficiency with New York attitude and Japanese volume throw ingredients in a bowl.  At least they take and yell your name out when it's ready - you're part of the show!  No, the real reason there is a line out the door is because the lunch crowd of Charlotte is DESPERATE for healthy alternatives.  Even though Crisp may not exactly hit the mark, they're the first salad joint in Charlotte and have cashed in.  If any of the owners happen across this review - I'd recommend taking a trip up to DC and checking out Chopt creative salad company.  Really think there is a high ceiling for a restaurant concept like this, so learning from a company that is killing with the same concept will bring a fresh (no pun intended) look into your offering."}
{"text":"Hands down the best salad in Charlotte (at least for lunch Uptown).  Great mix of greens and up to 5 toppings for $7 and with protein only $11!  Can't beat it and the staff is super nice and always upbeat.  Definitely one of a few go-to spots!"}
{"text":"A foray into the salad world is like stumbling onto the dark web. So many secrets, so many questions.   My pathetic attempt to attempt eating healthy has my bank  account meeting it's demise.   Being an analytical, inquisitive natured person, I have to ask, why the hell do salads cost so much!? Farm to table right? No processing, no slicing or dicing (okay maybe all slicing and dicing), Just wash the damn lettuce right? But since I've been on my quasi-health kick, I had an epiphany. I realized that getting a cheesesteak with fries or a bacon marmalade burger; meals that take me hours to prepare at home are actually cheaper than these seemingly simple salads.  What gives?  I mean, who knew salads with protein costs an average of $12? Is it the shelf life of veggies? Is this the national average? Is this median specific to uptown Charlotte? Is all this bacon and cheese on top healthy? D&D, the multiple places with Fresh in the name. $9 for a salad sans protein?  $2.50+ for protein and were up to $13-14 with tax and tip.   So anyways, what were we reviewing again? Oh yea CRiSP. Back to Crisp. Just another salad bar with in house salads and make your own salads. Nothing crazy, just your basic salads that well, taste like a salad. Proteins aren't insanely marinated, so you still get many natural flavors. Salads aren't overdressed, so you still taste the veggies. And the best part?   The best part is most salads cost only about $9 WITH protein!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I used to avoid this place like the plague, but only because every time I passed it, the line was literally out-the-door.  Finally a friend convinced me to try it out for lunch on a gorgeous spring day.  Got there around 1ish... the line was about 6 people deep (in the Latta Arcade Hallway) but fast moving... once I got inside, I understood why the line always stuck out into the hallway... the place is tiny.  They have two, employees slinging salads in the front (I'm going to call them salad hustlers since they move so quick in order to get the line moving), two employees manning the cash register, a small grill section manned by one person - I dunno how he managed to keep all the orders right.  My friend got the grilled salmon, which takes a bit longer on the grill so we sort of plastered ourselves against the wall so that the line can come in and leave with their freshly made salads.  It wasn't that long a wait.  I got the asian salad which was a perfect blend of spinach, a whole thing of grilled chicken breast, mandarin orange slices, sliced almonds, and a light oil dressing... oh yeah, the crunchy egg noodles for some texture.  I was super impressed in getting a really fresh salad and the price wasn't bad at all either.  Probably the funniest thing about waiting for your salad is watching the 'salad hustlers' turn out salads... each of them made in their own silver mixing bowl and   pair of tongs.  Granted there are a ton of options on the menu, you can also 'make your own salad' and it is crazy how fast they sling the ingredients in... you can have the dressing on the side or mixed in... in my first experience they don't drown the salad in dressing either.  I will be back... I really thought Crisp was going to move into a larger space in the Latta Arcade, but it may have fallen through - they could definitely use the larger space."}
