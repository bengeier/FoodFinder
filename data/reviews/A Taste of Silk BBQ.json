{"text":"Alright y'all! I'm gonna be REAL with all of you! This BBQ joint is the bomb!!! Best BBQ hands down that I've ever tasted in Arizona! I've been to all the spots But Silk's BBQ is not to be messed with! The helping portions are big and the ribs are truly fall of the bone! The brisket is out of this world I love the flavor and the taste of the hickory wood chips in meat! Overall I give it 5 out of 5 stars! Chef Silk, you alright my brotha! I'll be down twice a week for the Brisket and Ribs!"}
