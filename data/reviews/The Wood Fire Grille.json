{"text":"Went to Woodfire Grille because we had a groupon to use. When we got there and sat down we ordered drinks and appetizers to start. Our apps came before the drinks were even delivered. We got the calamari and stuffed peppers which both were just OK, the calamari is over breaded and the peppers are messy and very spicy sausage and I never found a pepper.  Then we ordered dinner and while we were waiting for salads we never got a chance to order another drink and no pepper was delivered. Salads came 15 minutes later then dinner took another 45 minutes after we ordered to get to us. We spent a total of over 2 hours at this place for dinner. We were going to get dessert but were all tired so I asked for 2 desserts to go, I should have checked the bag. We ordered cheesecakes but ended up with Cobbler and Ice Cream. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and kids on a Friday Night.  Kids wanted to go to Red Robin, but we convinced to try.  Food was excellent, great kids menu!  Price was excellent.  Had the pit beef and blue cheese and onion tarts.  Service was very friendly and made good recommendations.  The bill was less expensive then the chain and food was a hundred times better.  Will go back for sure!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Initial visit was passable. Pork Chop is outstanding. Used Groupon to offset exorbitant cost for wood grilled entrees. Decent beer selection.  Second visit prompted review. No host/hostess to greet us. When finally greeted Tables open everywhere, but we were still forced to wait for one to be cleaned. All specials and pork chop were 86'd, so i tried what appeared to be $17 Chicken Marsala... VERY Poor choice.  Chicken was small and dry, sauce overwhelming and sides underwhelming. Calamari was good. No complaints. Crab cakes were average, and well overpriced. In fact, Everything is overpriced. Irish coffee cost $9. If I return it will be only for pork chop."}
{"text":"Lackluster service and average food isn't going to make it in this economy.  We seemed to have the same experience as everyone else.  There was no one at the hostess stand when we entered but someone came within a couple minutes.  We got seated and were asked if we'd like drinks before we even had a chance to sit down.  We got our waters and drinks fairly quickly once we had a minute to look over the drink list and were told the menu specials but then no one even looked at us for 15-20 minutes.  Once our waiter finally decided to actually wait on us, things seemed to run smoothly.  We got our app, then salads and bread and then our entrees.  I had the mushroom burger and spinach salad which were both decent.  My friend had  the salmon and beet salad but didn't care for either.  All in all the food is decent but nothing spectacular and over priced if you don't have a Groupon to use.  The thing the bugged me was the poor service.  We don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I'm very shocked to see the negative reviews here, as I love this this place! I have been here several times and each is just as amazing as the first. I purposely purchased a Groupon and used it the week i got it. Every staff I encountered has been accommodating to me. I have sat at the bar as well as tables. I have had the Delmonico pork Chop twice which is delicious! (ordered medium both times) the crab cakes several times ( love them!) the shrimp kabobs, chicken Florentine, filet Mignon, calamari, artichoke dip, and the Pitt beef sandwich. Honestly, I really enjoyed everything I have had making my selection more difficult each time. Awesome patio with a full bar outside. As a craft beer drinker, I like the vast rotating selection they offer here as well. beautifully decorated restaurant. Well, all this talk about food is making me hungry! I guess to Woodfire Grille it is!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to the Wood Fire Grill in part because of a Groupon coupon and curiousity about the new place. One person in our party had heard about slow service but that wasn't the case during our visit. Service was prompt and friendly. We were deciding on wine and our server asked if I would like a sample taste,which I thought was great and very accomodating.   We started with the Cheese and Antipasti appetizer which was very good-three cheeses with grilled bread and crackers surrounded by an assortment of sausage, olives, etc. Great little bite for four with wine.  By chance we all ended up ordering the Pork Rib Chop. Outstanding-everything on the plate was savory and done right. The light sauce on the chop, the yukon gold grilled potato and the vegetable were all seasoned and delicious. The place isn't cheap but for a special occasion I would recommend. Very nice interior and a patio that alas will have to wait until next year-unless we get some serious Indian Summer."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice restaurant. It's nothing especially unique or with an imaginative menu, but it's a lovely restaurant (especially on the outdoor patio) for an upscale dining-out experience. Listen, the food is good, but overpriced.  The atmosphere is very chic and the service was lovely. Worth a go."}
{"text":"First visit and have to say things were great.  Had the Grilled Salmon and it was outstanding.   Great to have a nice place to grab a bite in Avon Lake and lots of menu options.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"There were four in our party and all of us were very pleased with our food.  Our server was very attentive and the manager came around twice to make sure everything was alright.  The pork chop was excellent and vegetables cooked just right, al dente.  I will definitely return as the food and friendliness of staff is hard to resist."}
