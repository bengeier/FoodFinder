{"text":"The two of us ordered the Momo tarte, Momo roll and soft shell crab (their version of Spider roll). Found all three to be excellent. 

I liked the Momo tarte more than I expected. Now I'll start demanding sushi cake for my birthday haha. There's something so flavourful about each bite. They really got the right blend and balance. 

The Momo roll is like a sushi version of surf n turf. Generous of soft shell crab in their version of Spider roll as well (the name escapes me....) 

Also the signature cocktail is excellent. Great atmosphere and service. All around great experience.

Give this place a go if you are looking for a hip atmosphere, good service and flavourful sushi dishes with a twist at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, overpriced, with ZERO vegan/vegetarian options - when we asked if they could do something veg for two of us, they offered to make us an avocado roll for 9 DOLLARS! Every other Japanese place I go prices that for 2.5-3.00 dollars each; and its definitely not a full meal on its own. We left to the other Japanese place down the road. (There are several on Baldwin)

You have opened a restaurant in TORONTO - have one good vegetarian option on the menu. Check Miku down near Harbourfront if you need inspiration for upscale veg Japanese options- They offer AMAZING gourmet veggie sushi.

Also, this place also got a yellow on their last health inspection, I'm sure they'll do something to improve but just be wary. (link http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2017/07/week-dinesafe-momo-san-wah-sing-the-captains-boil-cafe-la-gaffe/)"}
{"text":"Very slow service and the rice was hard and undercooked...not a good experience

The sushi was just okay, definitely had better at other places in toronto"}
{"text":"This could be some premium all you can eat sushi... but def not worth the price. I ordered the momo plate, tart, and the crispy Hokkaido roll. TBH I think sushi bong sushi rolls are better than this. I would rather go to jabistro (pay 10% more to eat something that's worth the price). I don't recommend this place at all. ALSO, they need better staff. They dropped the plates like 3 times in an hour...it was a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere. I suggest to make a reservation ahead of time since it does get quite busy. I tried their salmon aburi sushi and saba aburi - both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved every pieces of food they brought us. Jalapeño poppers were yummy and the chef's recommended serving had a great variety of taste and textures. Service was great. Would recommend anytime. Wish it was patio weather as they have a great outside sitting area."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this restaurant looking at the pictures and reviews. 

I went with a friend awhile back on a week night and ordered the aburi sushi and aburi oshi as well as tempura. The aburi sushi was tasty but I think pricey for what you're getting.  The tempura however was disappointing.  Small portions, batter was not light and crispy as it should be.  Tempura should be a no brainer for any restaurant that claims to be Japanese.  There is really no excuse to screw up fried vegetables and shrimp. 

Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! 

Service:
The server was very patient and friendly while my boyfriend and I were deciding what to order. Throughout the meal, she checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our experience or had any questions. The waiter/bartender who made our drinks also checked in to see that we loved our drinks. 

Food and drinks:
We ordered their daily special which was centered around tuna belly (3 pieces of o-toro maki, 4 pieces of o-toro nigiri, 3 pieces of o-toro with uni on top, and an o-toro hand roll), a plate of aburi oshi sushi (variety of pressed sushi), momo tart, and aburi sashimi (6 pieces mixed). Everything was delicious and very well presented. Both of us tried signature cocktails (red dog and waters of joy) and we were both very happy with the turnout. 

Atmosphere:
Nice decor with an exposed brick wall. Lighting was nice and music was lively but not overwhelming. From the bar, you can see the bartender mixing drinks and chefs working on the sushi which was neat. 

Overall, the value was great compared to other high end sushi places. The taste and quality were also key factors and they passed with flying colours. Really enjoyed this and will definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Everything was.. MEH here. 

They call themselves Aburi Sushi Bar, modern take on sushi restaurant I guess, but they don't live up to their fancy description of the place. Once you step into the restaurant, the decor is pretty nice and modern, but that's the only positive experience you will have from this place. 

Their dishes are heavily relying on the sauce, and ingredients are not executed right while they are not fresh enough. 

The service was extremely slow, we had to call a passing by server every time we wanted something from them including the bill, not to mention the fact that we waited for more than 15 minutes for our server to come take the order when we first came into the restaurant. (It wasn't that busy either..)

If you are thinking of coming here, I strongly recommend that you spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"This new restaurant makes a great addition to Baldwin street! Food was delicious, especially liked the momo tart, which was unique. The aburi sushi was not the best but tasty enough. I think it's a little pricey for what you get. The pork belly and tempura was just ok. We ordered it so our three year old could eat something. I also ordered one of their cocktails. Can't remember the name but it had a tropical pineapple feel to it. When the drink came, there wasn't enough alcohol and the bartender had to add more rum. Service was ok, a little slow. They also mischarged us and added another cocktail to our bill. I think this was just a misstep as they had just opened when we went. All in all, I would go back."}
{"text":"the sashimi is not fresh at all. Oshikushi and aburi plate tastes ok, but not comparable with Jabistro or Miku. Momisan roll, is not good. The atmosphere of restaurant and service are good, but there are little black flys around the place, and even a dead one on the menu.  Overall, not recommend, will not come for second time."}
{"text":"TLDR; ebi basil oshi sushi was delicious. Everything else was passable/not good.

While this place is very \"instagrammable,\" it definitely does not compare to JaBistro in terms of quality. We tried the Momo Tart, which was the biggest disappointment of the night. It's literally just stacked rice and spicy, flavourless fish. The flavours weren't impressive and honestly, I think I found shrimp shell in my portion.

The ebi basil oshi sushi was the biggest surprise. It tastes like a pizza, which sounds gross because it's sushi, but the creaminess and the basil mix so well together. This is the only dish that I'd come back for. We also ordered the salmon, saba and ebi plum oshi sushi, but none of it was memorable and you could definitely get better quality at JaBistro or Miku."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for 2-4 people. 

But servers are extremely busy. 

The sushi is great, $28 for 12 pieces. The signature sushi plate is strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Decided to be a true glutton and try this place out after eating dinner already (Summerlicious anyone?) 

Ordered the Ebi Basil Oshi and Momo Tart. I also wanted to try the 65cm Beef Oshi advertised on BlogTO, but was told that item was no longer available for the menu :(

Momo Tart was good, but didn't taste that amazing for the price point - however, it's still very aesthetically pleasing for those Instagram posts. Ebi Oshi was awesome! Will definitely return to try their other torched oshis on an emptier stomach."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch on a weekday. The service was satisfactory and the food was okay, but unfortunately nothing spectacular, for this price range. There are better alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"First time there and it was awesome! Their seared scallops salmon sushi was to die for. The pork belly was too skinny in my friends opinion and I would recommend you stay away from it if you prefer it to be a little more fatty. Definitely want to go back and try the Momo tart and their cocktails! 

 Their service was also on point. The only thing that I want to point out is the tight space. Even though there were a few other empty tables, they seated most of their diners in one corner. It was very difficult getting in and out of my seat."}
{"text":"This my first time been to this place. The environment is good. Food looks very fancy and it taste ok. There still a lot of space for improvement. I hope next time I come here, there will be some improvement."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday and we made reservations online so we didn't have to wait.  We each ordered the Momo Plate which is a lunch special and the Momo Tart to share. 
The Momo Tart is a bit like a sushi pizza - with layers of rice and salmon tartar and topped with a piece of shrimp and scallop sashimi (the scallop was lightly torched).  The Momo Tart is very aesthetically pleasing and actually more substantial than it appear.  Taste-wise...it was just okay.
The Momo Plate consists of a plate with 5 pieces of aburi sushi and then another plate with a selection of cooked foods.  The aburi sushi was okay...it tasted great but the pieces of fish were quite thin.  The shrimp tempura in the cooked foods plate was delicious.  The Momo Plate is pretty expensive for $18 - you get 5 pieces of sushi with 4 small plates of cooked food.
Overall everything tasted good, but overall is is overpriced - will not be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Tried this new place for lunch and got the traditional plate. The sushi rice (shari) was NOT the correct type. Not only did this place use long grain rice, but it was flavourless as well. The server made the excuse that it was because of their supplier that they needed to make the substitute, but for a place that serves \"sushi\"... it's unacceptable. For the price paid, I expected properly made sushi but instead I got flavourless sham sushi.

TL;DR.. this place isn't horrible, but the price definitely doesn't reflect the quality."}
{"text":"The food was so bad that i am going to write my very first review on yelp. By looking at previous reviews, we came here prepared to wait long time for our orders, luckily the food didn't take very long to arrive, which is good. We ordered momo signature plate, and a roll that is wrapped with AA beef?  And WOW the food was so bad. The fish quality was not fresh at all..... and the roll and aburi sushi were tasteless. It is just so bad I can't even believe the good reviews here. The only dish we liked about was the plain rice that came with spicy seafood pot. LOL. Spent $100 here was just waste of money. If you are looking something similar, try all you can eat sushi. You get same quality of food there but cheaper and fuller. Also, we asked two different servers for the bill and took them 20min until we asked third server. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Interior: 4
Ambience: 3.5
Taste: 3.5
Service: 3.5

Momosan had a nice, lounge-like appearance to dine in. On a nice sunny day, the patio is a great spot and an interesting choice to sit for sushi. 

For branding themselves as an aburi (torched sushi), the sushi were mediocre at best. It made a good attempt to retain the flavour of the fish like at higher end aburi sushi, but the intensity could've been much more. But I guess you're getting what you pay for in price. 

The waiters/waitresses seem to find difficulty in figuring out which dish went where a few times. It reminds me of the fact that this is a still a soft opening and there's still some kinks to work out. 

All in all, would I go again? Maybe not anytime soon. I feel that I wouldn't mind spending a little bit more for really good quality sushi. This was a little too pricey for what I paid for."}
{"text":"We did eventually get to sit down after a good wait.

We didn't get our drinks until pretty much after we ate our food and the food came out at totally different times with ridiculously long waits in between. One person would finish their dish by the time somebody else received theirs.

The food tasted great but I found it was way overpriced for what it was. We left almost 2 hours later still hungry so we ended up eating elsewhere.

I would have been willing to give this place a better review but it was truly the service that killed it for me. Our waiter was extremely rude and even snarky."}
{"text":"Wonderful  service, nice sushi within reasonable price, cornish hen is juice and the beef oshi  sushi  is very good and that's made by waygu beef!"}
{"text":"This is a tentative review for their soft opening, so the quality may vary later on.

We got the Momo lunch $18. The sushi was alright. I disliked the chicken potato dish and the fried shrimp. We also had the salmon pressed sushi, which I think was a better choice than the $18 lunch, which I think was not worth it.

Service was good. The interior design and ambiance were great. Looking forward to see their improvements in the future."}
{"text":"The aburi momo plate is amazing. Extremely tasty and flavourful. I ordered them through Foodora and even after delivery it tasted the same. #obsessed."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered the momo plate and salmon Oshi. We had our anniversary lunch on a weekday- no line ups. Service was great and food came out so quick.  
This is definitely a place I'd return to and recommend to others. Salmon oshi was perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We came here, the four of us (including a baby). The food was fantastic. My daughter and son (the baby) ate everything with great joy. It is not really a kid friendly place and they were still as accommodating as they could be which we appreciated greatly. Thank you.

The sushi was excellent. Usually, at sushi places you get a bottle was soy and some wasabi to enhance the flavor. These pieces needed nothing but your taste buds. The seasoning was perfect.  The shrimp fritters were fought over. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night and it was for my girlfriend's birthday. It was a cool summer night and the patio was an amazing choice. Restaurant had a fairy contemporary feel and the decors were simple but on-point. We tried a variety of their dishes and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Would recommend their MoMo Sour cocktail, Ebi Fritters, the sushi sampler with all the delicious aburi sushi, and the pork belly. Our waitress was this cute mixed Japanese girl who was very attentive. 
I have been to Miku, Ja Bistro and had many other aburi sushi in the past. The sushi here was one of the best. It is mostly in the rice these guys use, which makes up 80% of the sushi's flavour in the first place. 
Highly recommended spot and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I came with some coworkers for lunch once, and came for lunch by myself once. Both times the sushi I had were excellent. I had the Aburi Momo Plate both times (aburi oshi sushi 6pc, aburi nigiri sushi 3pc, regular nigiri sushi 3pc) for $28, and both times were excellent. The price was also very reasonable.

However, it seemed like it could be slow at lunch time. The server mentioned that certain menu at menu at lunch are not available, which I took as meaning \"short staffed\". I asked if the Aburi Momo Plate was available (it's in a section that she said was not part of lunch, but I thought momo plate is just a slightly bigger version of stuff that are already served for lunch, so I thought I'd ask), but she said it was available, so I ordered it). It looked like that server was the only one taking orders, and it took a while to get to us. The food also took a while to come.

Some of my friends' dishes ranged from excellent looking (eel on rice) to plain looking and poorly constructed (vegetarian sushi), but my friends enjoyed them nonetheless).

Overall, a good place to get some torched sushi.

Quality: 8/10. Services: 6/10. Value: 7/10. Overall: 7.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch alongside my fellow foodie friend about a week ago. We were both eager to try Momo San as we'd seen the feature on blogTO and are, admittedly, self-professed sushi fanatics! Although we made a reservation in anticipation of lines, one mightn't have been needed (though to be fair we went on a Wednesday so none of the nearby restaurants were bustling at the time). The interior is not too large, which we found surprising for a relatively upscale sushi venue. Accordingly, we sat in the patio, where there was space aplenty. 

Our order:
+Momo San roll ($15) - spicy shrimp and cucumber topped with beef short-rib and wasabi sweet onion (8 pieces) 
+Momo Plate ($18) - 5 pieces of nigiri and a separate set of chicken/shrimp/a small salad 

I was tempted to order the tart given how popular doshi / sushi donuts are these days, but it didn't look very filling for the price. I thought the roll was tasty (beef rib was not too large or small, shrimp was cooked fine but I thought it could have been spicier) yet not as exciting as I might've expected from a signature roll (perhaps this is my fault as I might have wanted to order the torched sushi which they are more known for! I'll have to come back). The portion of the roll was also a bit meager for a full lunch (I wasn't too hungry at the time, but if you are I'd recommend the Momo Plate instead as the portion is satisfying!). The plate features a generous portion of chicken in particular, and my friend seemed to enjoy her nigiri as well. Service was alright - our waitress seemed a bit perplexed when I asked her about the ingredients in the Momo San roll prior to ordering, but little hiccups can always be forgiven :) 

Overall, not a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and really enjoyed the food and the service was excellent. We got their signature plate which gives you a sampler of their sushi and nigiri, and the soba peperoncini. Everything was really tasty, but the salmon oshi was definitely our favourite. Prices are on the expensive side though, so even though I loved the food here, I think I'd rather have Japanese AYCE for half the cost."}
{"text":"Aburi sushi band wagon. Expensive and everything tastes like mayo and a flame torch. Nothing tastes fresh or shows off the fish from the sushi. The servers were very very green. Look like children from high school. With no training. Only think they have going is a great patio."}
{"text":"For the price of the food i would not come here again, it was not worth it.
We chose to be seated on the patio because when we walked inside the restaurant it felt pretty stuffed and didn't feel like there was ac. However it was a bad choice to sit outside. Leaves kept falling on our table, there were bugs everywhere, and there was like this weird constant sprinkle of some kind of liquid from the tree above us. It left the table sticky and left residue on our phones, which means it was all over our food and in our water too.
Service was fast and the waitor kept checking up on us.
We ordered the signature sushi platter which consisted of 12 pieces of sushi, the chicken entree, and spicy hot pot.
The sushi was good, not mind blowing, and definitely not worth the price we paid.
The chicken was really good, it was well flavoured and juicy. However, the potatoes in the dish were very dry and bland. I always love potatoes of all kind, but this time the potatoes were not good at all.
The seafood hot pot was very very bland. It looked like it was going to be full of flavour, but we were very disappointed.
Both entrees came with a bowl of rice, which was much needed because of the small portions of the dishes.
Given the price compared to the portions and flavouring, i don't think it was worth it at all. I do not recommend coming here for dinner. There are plenty of better sushi or asian restaurants in downtown."}
{"text":"The sushi was good.  Aburi sushi especially melted in your mouth.  However do not order hot food as it takes forever to cook. We waited an hour for the hot food.  It is crazy as this was also lunch. I feel so bad for my friend as we had to go back to work and he had to run back and get a sub instead.  This restaurant seems to have good servers and they were gracious when we said we had to go without the food and they removed it from the bill with no problem.  Unfortunately, I am never going back to this place as the awful logistics is a big red flag for me.  Best of luck to you if you ever try this restaurant.  Have a snack before you go!"}
{"text":"It's pretty but not sure if it's worth it. It's also mostly rice. It's visually appealing and tasty for sure - you don't need soya sauce - but I also prefer sushi with more fish than rice. Ingredients are fresh. Would come here once in a while but not often. Each sushi dish is about $15-$20 and only 4-6 pieces, so we had to order three dishes between two girls and I was slightly hungry still. Also on weekdays wait time for service and dishes took more time than necessary when there was only a few tables filled."}
{"text":"Sort of disagree but not completely on the many complaints of value here, I left full here but not belly-busting and paid about the same price as 2 adult AYCE Sushi fares. I can say I much rather eat here than AYCE Sushi LOL. 

Walked over after finishing the infinity mirror exhibit at the AGO. It was about 3:15-3:30PM and the place was completely dead not a soul that wasn't a worker, usually not a good sign but I already committed to coming here. Choose to sit in the patio considering the decent weather. Started off with water and after going thru the menu 20 times ordered the following 

Miso Soup - Standard, nothing special not watery or salty. 

Tako Wasa - Decent didn't taste like the generic frozen in a bag type but I could be wrong LOL. Would've been fine without thoos

Momo(Sushi) Tart - AMMAZZING, would've thought it was just going to be a mini-cake sized roll but I actually really enjoyed this a lot 

Aburi Salmon Oishi - AMMAZZING, a little too much rice but what compensated for that was this literally melts in your mouth. I didn't expect too much from this but it blew my mind LOL. 

Spicy Tuna/Spicy Unagi Roll - Suggest by the server as a \"popular item/roll\" after taking a bite I could see why! The \"kick\" comes from the spicy tuna sashimi mixture on top of the roll and inside the roll there's cucumber and fried unagi giving this roll more depth. It wasn't as good as the salmon oishi but I would still order this 

all this was about $75 tax and tip in, I left full and satisfied 

Service was spotty, server was there when needed but can't really say much considering we were the only table there. Don't think my water was ever filled to be honest. 

Place seemed pretty modern from what I saw on the inside of the restaurant but the patio was nice especially on a nice day Baldwin St is perfect for people watching if that's something you enjoy doing. 

I would come back"}
{"text":"Would have given this place a 3/5 if their customer service was better. The food was bland and lacking more flavour tbh. Can't find the menu online, so I can't remember the specific names of what ordered, but I know it was their seafood hot pot, chicken aburi, and one of their specialty rolls with a piece of beef on top, edamame, and miso soup which we didn't get but were charged for. 

As for the service - my fiancé and I weren't finished our meal yet, but the server came over and asked if we wanted to pay, which we found odd. He also told us that the kitchen would be closing soon, so we'd have to order additional hot foods immediately. It was 9:30pm on a Wednesday night. According to their FB website, they close at 11pm. In our hurry to leave, we didn't notice that we were charged for the miso soup that we didn't get. When we told one of the servers she just said \"Sorry! Ok next time\" without taking down our information or calling the manager or whatever you're supposed to do to make ppl feel better lol."}
{"text":"I'm a bit sad to see negative reviews based on service because I had a great experience but then again, experiences are subjective to a person and of course, the service they receive that day. In any case, my boyfriend and I did a walk-in around 6:30pm on a Thursday night and was seated right away on the patio. We had seen the momo tart featured on BlogTO and we knew we had to try it! We decided to order small since we were going for desserts after, and plus, I knew that places like this were more quality over quantity experiences - that you might not get \"full\" from the meals but every bite will be to ultimate satisfaction due to good quality and taste. Like Miku ($$$, yet amazing). All the dishes are sample portions. 

Service: We had a polite waitress and she was quite was patient and helpful with us when we were slightly indecisive about what to order. She helped with recommending us which dishes were popular and came by to fill out water a few times as we ate our meal (which was delicious!). 

The food: Delicious and high quality! We ordered the sushi sampler, the momo tart and I got a drink (Gari). The food came quite in an efficient time given the busyness of the new establishment, and we were slowly savoring the momo tart dish together as we waited for the sushi sampler. 

Worth the price? Yes. Expensive, but that is what you pay for quality."}
{"text":"Momo San is an amazing new contemporary sushi restaurant. Let me tell you it doesn't disappoint. 

The flavours and textures are amazing. Everything you need to satisfy any umami craving you have. I had the combo platter and was so happy I did because it afforded me a taste of everything on the menu without having to get too much. 

The prices are more than reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get. 

I definitely have to say that Momo San is the best new addition to Baldwin Village."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely AMAZING!! The service is incredible. The food is incredible. I'm not much a sweets person but they treated me and my friends to some incredible matcha ice cream! The interior of the restaurant is very nice and the atmosphere is very fun. I would really like to point out how nice the staff was, and although they are understaffed right now I really hope people start to find this place."}
{"text":"Service was not outstanding or anything, they forgot my friend's beer but aside from that the rest of the service was fine. We were greeted and sat down at a table quickly after we walked in, the waiter took our order in a timely manner, and the food came pretty quickly. The sushi is good for it's price range, though I do find that there are better sushi places within the same price range. The most outstanding thing about this place is their presentation of the food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with 3 other friends before going to the pride parade. We were seated immediately upon entering and given lunch menus. One of my friend is a vegetarian and we saw that the menu had limited options but the server informed us that we can order vegetarian versions of any dish, which I thought was accommodating of them. 
We all decided to order the momo plate ($18) including my vegetarian friend. The chef prepared a different dish ($16) for her and while it wasn't on the lunch menu, I believe it was on the main menu... can't remember the name though. 
When the dishes came out, everything looked SO DELICIOUS, I just wanted to gobble it all up. The taste on the other hand, just wasn't impressive. The fish on top of the pressed sushi was really thin or something because I couldn't taste anything besides the sauce so I didn't really know what I was eating. 
The other dishes tasted okay, nothing spectacular. While this experience was so-so, I do want to give this place another shot and try other items on the menu. I did see a couple order dishes that looked delicious but were not on the lunch menu, so I'll ask for the dinner/main menu next time."}
{"text":"Really wanted to check out this spot since it opened. It was quite good and the service was wonderful. I'm always about quality over quantity, this was quite superb. I would say its on par with Miku, the quality of fish here was fresh, mouth watering and it was enjoyable during every bite."}
{"text":"This was okay. The interior was nice and trendy. I loved their table and chair setup near the door! 

We got this seafood soba entrée and an eaux de joie. Not a lot of seafood in the soba but I guess it was sufficient. Personally, I don't know how to judge soba, but I like that the tastes were not super salty. You could taste the natural flavour of the seafood. 

Eaux de joie is a vodka cocktail with strawberry infused soju. It tasted like strawberry yogurt with a little alcoholic kick, which becomes more prominent as you reach the bottom of the champagne glass. 

I wouldn't rave about this place as the food didn't really stand out to me. I think they do better with drinks than with food. I wouldn't come back again unless every other place on Baldwin was closed or packed."}
{"text":"I saw pictures of Momo San sushi on social media and I was stunned by how beautiful their food looked like. I knew I had to check them out.

When I arrived to the location, I saw chefs preparing food and everything looked just like I had seen online, the presentation was really amazing. We were seated and we got menus and decided what we wanted to eat. After that the waitress appeared to have forgotten us and after waiting for a long time I had to get up and walk to the front desk and tell the staff we want to order. The waitress apologized and she said it's a busy and chaotic day and that they had to call back up staff to try to make things work.

We ordered \"Traditional sushi plate\", \"Momo San signature plate\" and \"Momo tart\". Traditional sushi plate was quite good and the qualify of the fish was good. The dish had 7 pieces of nigiri but disappointingly the 3 maki pieces were tiny cucumber rolls.

Momo San signature plate was delicious. 6 of the pieces were pressed sushi that had only a very thin slice of fish and some sauce on top of large block of rice. After initial pleasant flavour in your mouth, the rest of the piece was basically chewing on rice. Nigiri pieces were delicious and fresh.

Momo tart was tasty, but in the end I felt it was too heavy on rice.

They also seemed to have issues with their sound system and the music they played sounded terrible. For some off reason they played some rockabilly in the beginning of our visit and it didn't fit the decor at all and after that they switched to TOP50 hits which teenagers may like but I found mainly annoying.

Overall, I found that the price for the quality and amount of the sushi was too high. Their presentation is 10/10 and possibly the most beautiful sushi I've seen in Toronto. Quality wise I think the sushi was 7.5/10 and value for the money was 3/10. I really wanted to love this place but service was slow and chaotic and price for the quality too high. I left the place somewhat disappointed and I have mixed feelings whether to go back or not. This could be a must place to go with some somewhat easy adjustments."}
{"text":"The hot dishes here was so salty. We ordered the ox bone and the pork belly. If you don't like salty foods, don't order it."}
{"text":"Definitely on the pricier side but one of my favorite sushi places so far. Their rolls are unlike any other restaurant. Try the oshi!"}
{"text":"I came with a friend and we each ordered the seafood pot (which was poorly named because as you see in the picture, there is no pot) and split the sampler plate. The seafood pot was way over priced! For $20 you got 1 piece of corn, 3 shrimp, a few pieces of frozen squid and some potatoes. I have a fairly small appetite but even I felt the portions were tiny and I was still quite hungry afterwards. The food was also too salty. 

For the sampler, the rice was well seasoned but the raw fish was of mediocre quality. It was like something you would expect from an AYCE place. The torched sushi however was quite good, I particularly enjoyed the salmon.

Overall I was fairly disappointed and found it just wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Saw Momo San in the list of new restaurants in Toronto so decided to give it a try. Went on a Saturday night with two other friends and we all had a great experience. The ambiance is nice and laid back, there is no need to dress up (compared to Kasa Moto or Miku). There is a good (not extensive) selection of cocktails, beers, and wine). I highly recommend Tokyo Hot, which is not on the current menu but was offered by the manager. We ordered tempura, chicken aburi, sashimi, jalapeno poppers, forest sushi, dessert, and the Momo tart. Hands down, the best dish is the Momo Tart. Food in general is good but might need some tweaking to make it memorable. Wish there are more options for dessert and not just green tea ice cream with pound cake and strawberries. It tasted like store bought. Service was great, our server and the manager were both attentive and extremely nice. Will definitely go back to try the other items in the menu. Hope the menu will be available online eventually and online reservations can be obtained."}
{"text":"Momo tart is really delicious, with the mixture of salmon, tuna, avocado and rice. Signature sashimi plate was also presented with all sorts of fresh stuff. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 22! That's right...22! We were able to get comfortably seated outside and had an amazing waiter. After we ordered, they brought us salted green beans as service while we waited for our food. This place is conveniently located in Baldwin village where there are also tons of fantastic restaurants! 

The food came relatively quickly for the amount of people were in our group. I ordered the seafood soba pasta (can't recall what its called off the top of my head. sorry!) and it was amazing. Everyone else in the group who ordered it, loved it too. This is somewhere I would definitely look to coming back to. 

The waiter was 10/10! He brought out a couple FREE shots for my friend who was having her 20th birthday and was super nice and funny about it all. Before coming here, I did not have very high expectation but the food and service definitely blew me away. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Gave Momo San a second try as they changed their lunch menu since their soft opening. The service was great, including the waitress and chefs. 

I ordered the Aburi Momo Plate and the problem is the value of the dish. The two nigiri are cooked shrimp and albacore tuna, whereas the aburi are two cooked shrimp and two salmon... The pieces of maki were spiced gourd... Definitely not my cup of tea for 19$ if all I'm getting is cooked shrimp and gourd. I think I can boil shrimp myself :) Moreover, the sushi rice is cold which isn't too pleasant. 

Overall, Momosan is a good option for sushi on Baldwin since the other sushi shops closed. The restaurant is nicely renovated. Just be warned of what you will get."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and although we had reservations, the restaurant was not busy at all, which was surprising. They have a nice covered patio as well as trendy decor inside, with an interesting booth sitting arrangement. Server was polite and courteous, and we were seated promptly. 

Momo tart: it was hard to eat with a group of people as when it was sliced it would fall apart. Overall the flavour as good, being able to taste the avocado and salmon, but it was nothing special. 

Momosan signature plate: a taster of the aburi sushi and aburi oshi. Plating and prep was nice, but maybe only half of the pieces actually tasted good. 

Salmon oshi: probably the best thing we had. Momo sauce is something special and the salmon is seared perfectly. We ordered a second round of these. 

Momosan roll: bland and the beef on top was quite tough considering it was AAA. The filling of shrimp and cucumber was plain and did not have much flavour.

Soft shell crab roll: I personally love soft shell crab and will order it whenever it is available. This roll only came with 4 pieces vs the others had 6+. The roll had decent crab flavour but I had to dip it in the chili aioli. It also came with 2 pieces of crab on the side which was deep fried but soft and soggy when we got it. 

Seafood pot: seafood boil flavouring on top of seafood. Flavour was bold and spicy, but it did not marinate well into the seafood. I had to dip into the pot to soak up the sauce. 

The cocktails we had were 3.5/5, nothing that blew me out of the water. While we were there multiple drinks were dropped behind the bar, and a server had slipped on the slippery floor. Be wary. 

This place is riding a hype train, you can get similarly priced food with better quality without coming downtown."}
{"text":"I don't believe a lot of people know about this place. When I went here for dinner at 6, the place was empty and then another table came in at around 7 but by the time we left, there was nobody else. For the amount of sushi pieces we got, the prices were decent. However, one thing that annoying was when the server kept messing up and giving us another table's dish even though there was only one other table... The quality of the sushi was very good, I definitely recommend the momo tart! Overall, i would definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"My overall impression is that it attempts to be upscale sushi but fails to deliver on taste and quality. 

Momo Tart - probably the most popular item, the presentation was nice and tasted better than expected. The layers of rice, avocado, spicy seafood, etc. worked well together. This was the best item of the night. 

Signature Plate - 6 pcs regular sushi (salmon, albacore tuna, hamachi, shrimp, scallop), 6 pcs oshi (salmon, mackerel, ebi) - just something lacking that made it seem like normal AYCE-quality sushi. Too much rice. The sauce on the ebi oshi was sour & weird (for lack of better word). 

Momo San Roll - (not) spicy chopped shrimp & cucumber wrapped in beef.. not much taste, again just felt something lacking. Could use some sauce. My friend described it as 'supermarket kimbap'."}
{"text":"The portions are tiny. Spent 40$ and left hungry. Got the seafood 'pot' entree with rice. It said there was supposed to be scallops in the dish but I had none. The dish was also literally 1/3 potatoes and 1/3 corn. Seriously if  I'm paying so much for seafood why am I getting like 6 pieces of seafood total? And if it's labeled as an entree, I should be at the very least satiated after having that, much less hungry wtf. I also feel like they were relying too much on the spice and butter sauce for flavor that they didn't really bother seasoning it properly, so the whole dish was kind of just a bland spicy flavor.

Redeeming star for them was the sashimi which was delicious, even though that portion was tiny as well. And just a heads up, there's a mandatory 18% tip for parties larger than 6."}
{"text":"I just left this restaurant and honestly feel cheated! I had high expectations due to decent reviews but I will never come back. The prices are steep and the sushi is the worst quality I've had in the city. 

The place gets a star due to great service, decor and sushi presentation but that's about it. 

We ordered the sashimi sample and for 30$ you receive 8 small fragments of sashimi - albeit beautifully presented on a plate -but the fish was not well prepared/cut. Not worth it at all. 

We also had the crab roll which was mediocre and tasted like canned tuna was rolled into it. The final dish was one of the seared fish sushis; for which the rice to fish ratio was way off. 

Honestly, the best part was the edamame. Do not come here if you're looking for great sushi. This is just another overpriced showy Toronto gimmick and NOT worth the steep price tag."}
{"text":"Omg I love the salmon abrui sushi here. The momo plate was also really good and great value for your money. The interior was deco was modern. I prefer the bench tables in the front. Came here for lunch when it wasnt too busy. Sushi quality is very high. Would come again. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite torched sushi places! Their specialty platter is amazing. The torched mayo ontop just adds so much smooth texture and flavour. Their soba noodle is amazing as well with tons of garlic flavour! The calamari is okay. That's why I had to give 4 stars only. The batter is a little too oily and too much. If it was a lighter Panko on the outside it would have been perfect. I wish they had Brussels sprouts just separate because they were SO delicious."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The wait was an hour but it was expected since this new restaurant was highly promoted on social media. 

We ordered the momo tart ($15) and the momo san signature plate ($28) - quality of the fish on the nigiri was not too fresh. But presentation-wise it was 5/5.  

Staff: Slow - took some time to provide us menus and water - considering they just opened the restaurant, I'm sure this is an area they are trying to improve on already!  
Price: $$ - it's comparable to Miku's lunch menu prices 
Environment: Clean and Insta worthy"}
{"text":"Initially wanted to try this place out since it opened up quite recently. Reservations were super easy to make through their website.  They confirmed my book within an hour of my request. 

It was a pretty hot day and I was a little disappointed that the waitress could not seat 3 of us near the back where there was AC because it was only limited to 2-people parties. Fortunately, it started cooling down during the evening.

The service was super fast with friendly staff members. We ordered the Momo San Signature plate ($28) which involves an assorted plate of Aburi and Sushi. I'm personally a really big fan of Aburi and this was one of my fav dishes.  Would definitely come back here to try some their other assorted plates."}
{"text":"The Japanese tart i think taste the best overall. The rest of the sushi and blowtorched sushi is okay. WE didn't try any sashimi though so can't comment on that. Waitresses were nice, however we waited over an hour for our food, and it was not too busy Sunday night. Because of that, the owners offered us free cocktails, which was nice on their part. The sushi tastes pretty good, pricing is not that bad, but i have had better, not gonna lie. If you have chance of going, definitely try out the the sushi tart though."}
{"text":"Definitely a spot for first dates. Atmosphere is very modern chic and semi romantic. Food quality was pretty good but nothing that spectacular. Service was amazing! very friendly, warm and welcoming. Recommended to let the kitchen hold the salt on bone ox morrow dish! It was terribly salty and pricey."}
{"text":"New restaurant in the heart of Toronto! Coming from Vancouver, I was craving good sushi. My friends recommended that we try Aburi sushi at Momo San, a new place that just opened up but had hot reviews! The five of us ordered sushi platter ($28), which came with an assortment of sushi, momo tart ($15), and salmon oishi sushi. We originally planned to order the momo roll (AAA beef wrapped sushi) and crispy hokkaido roll, but were disappointed to find out that they both sold out just before our order (note that it was only 5:45pm when we ordered). The sushi itself was really good, very similar to Miku, and came out fairly fast. I would say the price is worth it to try the sushi. However, I have to point out that they are very unorganized. The waitresses took forever to come, did not collect the payments properly (I had to tell them they forgot to ask me to pay), and kept asking us if we were done (made me ask myself if they were short on plates as well as the sushi). 

Although the food tasted great, I'm not sure if I would come again anytime soon, as there are other places where I can get similar quality and taste in sushi with better and more organized experience."}
{"text":"Had an amazing sushi dinner last night at Momo San! Our server Jordan was awesome, he provided some insight, and recommendations for our group.

Oshi Kushi - This is delicious! It's scallop and unagi on top of salmon aburi oshi. The unagi is the real deal for eel (haha) - but seriously. So good. I'd get it again. 

Momo San Signature plate - It comes with 6 pieces of assorted aburi sushi and 6 pieces of assorted aburi oshizushi. If you don't know what to get, definitely get this! It's a bit of everything.

The Blue Fin Tuna special - the  of the night. Featuring cuts of a blue fin tuna (including Otoro ) in 5 ways: tataki, handroll, nigiri, and oshizushi. 

Drink of the night - I'm a terrible foodie and forgot the name. But it had rum, pineapple, calamansi, and ginger.

Matcha Ice Cream with Castella - pretty standard. The sushi is the star of the restaurant to be honest.

Overall I enjoyed my night. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best japanese restaurants in Toronto! I was lucky enough to visit here for some great food. This place only opened up not long ago but they're amazing! 
I also love the ambiance of the restaurant, it's definitely not like one of those neighborhood sushi restaurants we commonly see. It's very classy, modern and can be good for romantic dinners and parties. 
We tried a couple of different items on the menu but I was impressed with all the dishes we got. My friends and I were amazed! They also have a small cocktail bar so it's very different from your ordinary sushi restaurant!
Last but not least, the service was great and the staff were all friendly. 
I see some reviews saying that it's a bit pricey, but I totally think it's worth the money for the quality of food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Oshi sushi had great flavor without need for anything extra! Definitely would return. Service was also great."}
{"text":"They stopped putting the sauce on the salmon Oshi, they now just do a dollop and torch the salmon. I'm disappointment because it use to be fantastic now it's just dry :/"}
{"text":"I really had high expectations given how busy it was.  I was hoping that for the price mark, it would be as good as some place like Japango.  

Everything was overpriced and the restaurant was really confused with whether they should make everything like a kaiseki style or if they should make it a good old plain oshi.  The presentation of the food was beautiful but the taste didn't make up for the price it was set at and the presentation.  I felt like I was throwing money to make something look pretty, which I'm willing to do...if it tasted just as spectacular.  

Sadly, this place just didn't deliver it for me.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not good - but not because of value but because of quality. The ingredients were not fresh, and because of that, the flavours profiles of the food were overpowered by condiments.
Sushi tart - Supposedly one of the more popular items, it was so salty that it should come with an extra glass of water on the side
Sashimi salad - A very sad, dead looking dish. The sashimi weren't fresh, neither were the mixed greens. The greens were so dry that it looked like it could have came straight out of a box from Loblaws. The dish also features what I make out to be soy sauce jelly bits, which really goes with the whole sodium theme. It also (once again) strangely came with a side of spicy sauce when the salad was already dressed.
Grilled eel - Two pieces of eel drowned in thick Teriyaki sauce. Ugh

Overall, if you ever lacked sodium in your diet, give Momo San a try... No but really, I was expecting a little bit more from this place, especially learning that their kitchen staff consists of former Miku and Kasa Moto employees. If you're thinking about visiting, proceed with caution."}
{"text":"This place is super instaworthy - very hip vibes and patio seating looked very nice! The dishes were also plated very nicely and staff was friendly. It was my friend's birthday and they offered her a flaming birthday shot - absinthe! We had to soft shell crab roll, hokkaido roll, momo san signature plate (aburi!) and the sushi tart.  Being a sushi lover, I didn't find anything particularly special, the dishes I had was decent but nothing special. I also found the place to be pretty pricey for what we were getting compared to other places I've been to which offer similar selection. Overall, it was a nice one-time visit but not sure I'd come back again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi place I would recommend people to go. The waiter and waitress are super nice and they offer excellent service. We had a birthday party at the patio and we order a bunch of different signatures and oshi rolls and sushi plates. They were all amazing and they are all good deals if you compare to the miku's. The service is pretty good and I would highly recommend people bring your family and go there."}
{"text":"Momo San was modern with industrial and oriental notes, this level of sophistication is uncommon for a restaurant in this neighbourhood. 
I find their menu very limited for a larger group so I was expecting to be blown away since they essentially are forcing you to pick their specialty dishes.
Their food however was disappointing. It wasn't bad food, everything looked picture perfect but there seems to be little innovation and wow factor beyond the fancy plating.
You have had torched sushi elsewhere, are theres inferior? No...are they memorable, also no.
Their calamari and ebi fritters were too heavily battered with pancake like texture, reminded me of a pogo.
The chicken was good, but you can easily find a cheaper knock off at a family Japanese restaurant. We heard great things about their pork belly but it wasn't available.
Overall, I find them not worth the hype/money. You can find comparable or superior options easily."}
{"text":"Went to Momo San on friday. Here is my review.
Over all score is a 2.5/5
TLDR: Over all the food was okay, but service and prices are not on point. we did not leave full.
Highly unlikely to return, if I did it would be like 6 months later when they get the staff get their shit together.. but highly unlikely I would.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Service - 2/5
So I placed a reservation with them the other day, through their website's online booking, it was easy and user friendly, they let you know how many spots are left for each time slot, and I got an email confirmation quite quickly.
BF gets to the restaurant first and lets them know that we have a reservation for 4 ppl under my name for 6 p.m. Hostess doesn't find my name on the list. BF tells me and i send him the email confirmation to show her.
I arrive at the restaurant and see that BF is standing outside, he tells me that we still don't have a seat... ???????
So I go inside, say \"Hi, I have a reservation under Martina for 4 ppl at 6 p.m.?\" She looks at me with an annoyed look and looks at Johnny and says \"Yea, you're not on the list\" To which I say, \"Well yea, I have an email confirmation saying otherwise\" She looks at me and looks to the back of the restaurant, which I see are full of empty seats (mind you their patio is also completely empty, although we did ask for indoor seats) which to be fair have \"reserved\" plaques on them, and says, \"well, I don't know....\" and just stands there for a good 30 seconds.... ummmmmm excuse me????? okay fine i get it you're a new restaurant and you must be new... and never had any customer service training.. \"fine, is there someone I can talk to?\" she goes and grabs another server, and they promptly seat me and BF at a seat with no explanation or apology to what has happened... then tries to take away 2 of the take away 2 of the table settings before I remind them AGAIN its a table for 4...
Hostess brings us lunch menu..... okay... maybe cuz they're such a new restaurant they're still working off the lunch menu? but i distinctly remember seeing a dinner menu on their website... looks down at menu... \"Lunch is served from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.\"... okay then...
I flag down another guy, who appears to be the manager.. 5 mintues after trying to get the attention of the servers... I ask for a dinner menu he gets exasperated and said \"yes of course you can, i'm so sorry, i'll let the hostess know\" He takes the menus away... I wait another 5-10 minutes still no menu... i flag down the bartender and he brings me a dinner menu...
Other notes on service:
+ server took BF's drink away without asking if he was done with it... he was not.. we had to flag her back down...
+ Gemmy Dang had to ask 3 times to have her phone charged, each time they said they would come back for it, they did not... until the very last time she asked
+ food took way too long to arrive at our table, I estimate maybe 45 minutes for the first 2 plates to arrive and another 10 minutes on top of that for the other 2 plates.
Food - 3.25/5
The signature plate was great, especially the 6 Aburi sushi. but for me 6 pieces of \"regular\" sushi was a little heavy handed with the wasabi and also lacked a wow factor. (3.75/5)
Momo san signature roll was meh, not spectacular, not horrible. (2.5/5)
The Spicy Hot pot is a little misleading, as it doesn't really come in a hot pot, but rather on a platter? along with some rice. But it was actually quite tasty. (3.5)"}
{"text":"I love aburi sushi and couldn't wait to try this new addition to Baldwin Street. However, it was a major disappointment. We ordered quite a few dishes (almost all of the signature dishes with the word momo or momo-san in it) and found none of them on par with Jabistro/Miku, which are slightly more expensive but you really get what you pay for. I would not call it a cheaper alternative to Miku as it couldn't even compete with cheaper ACYE sushi in terms of taste. I agree with some of the comments below -- the momo san roll with the AAA beef on top was tasteless. The momo san tart had a beautiful presentation, yet the texture was mushy, and the brown sauce on the plate was overly heavy and dominant. The aburi sushi -- what i really came for -- copied the presentation of Jabistro/Miku, but didn't taste nearly as good. I've had better at Kiu uptown.

For someone who wants to try aburi (torched, flame seared) sushi for the first time, go to Jabistro/Miku. You will pay a bit more but it's definitely worth it. 

For people who's been to Jabistro/Miku and wants a cheaper alternative, I would recommend Kiu in Markham. Their Ebi Aburi (shrimp pressed sushi) was even better than Jabistro/Miku for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Was glad that we made a reservation because the restaurant was packed when we got there. We ordered a few dishes to share - the Momo tart, signature plate, and the momosan roll. My favourite was the momo tart and it also seems to be the most popular item on the menu. The seafood portion was quite generous and was flavourful. The signature plate was a combination of aburi and nigiri. We found there was a bit too much rice and a lack of sauce. The sashimi on the nigiri wasn't marinated but no soy sauce or wasabi was provided. The momosan roll was a specialty roll topped with beef. The flavour was all right but could use a bit more sauce. 

Overall, the food tasted fresh but it was as bit overpriced and the service was slow. Look forward to their improvements in the future."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant again recently and noticed the menu changed. Some of the dishes were removed from the menu leaving a smaller selection of food available to choose from. Prices have also gone up about $2-$3 for some dishes. 

This time I ordered the salmon oshi, the basil ebi oshi, the Hokkaido roll and the oshi Kushi. I had higher expectation after coming around a couple of times. But I have to say... the only thing that didn't disappoint is the salmon oshi. The salmon oshi is still delicious but other than that...The other dishes did not meet my expectations. The Hokkaido roll was one of my favourite dishes here but they some how changed it. There used to be actually pieces of raw scallop inside. But it now no longer has raw scallop or even if it does, it has really little. They replaced or changed it to some other shredded paste sauce thing inside and cucumbers. You can barely taste anything in the roll besides the cucumber. So it basically tastes like a cucumber roll. 

The basil oshi isn't my thing. Didn't really like the flavour. But it's okay. 

The oshi Kushi was okay. Nothing surprising. The order came with 4 pieces for $20. Priced at $5 per a piece pretty much, I expected something better. There was a disconnection between the scallop that was topped on the salmon. We asked them to torched the scallop for us. That made the sushi so much better because it blended better. There was no longer a huge disconnection between the raw and torched items. But didn't seem really worth it. 

Lastly, we were going to order sashimi this time around but the prices of sashimi have gone up and are way too overpriced. It used to be 10 piece of sashimi for $30. Now it is 8 pieces for $30 and 14 for $50. 

In my opinion, the food is okay. But I find this restaurant kinda overpriced now. Like, to pay that amount for a restaurant that's not par with miku or ja bistro or those one up there. Then it's not worth it. The decor and everything is nice but the location, style and service doesn't meet my expectations of one of those restaurant the I pay high value for."}
{"text":"It's a newly opened sunshi bar. We ordered beef sunshi, uni sushi and the salmon oshi. The salmon oshi has similar taste to miku's. Don't try the seafood hot pot. The seafood is fresh but the sause is not that good. Yakisoba is highly recommended."}
{"text":"We came right when the store opened so there weren't many people seated yet. Service was quick and food came fast. The two of us ordered the Momo Tart, Momo San Roll, Oshi Kushi, and the Momo San Signature Plate. We both agreed that the only nice surprise was the Momo Tart. Everything else was just ok, nothing special. The aburi styled sushi was not torched enough to have that special smoke taste. The fishes did not taste very fresh, and are rather bland. The Momo San Roll is wrapped with short rib, but they taste absolutely.. average. 

All food are mediocre. Feels like a replicate of Miku's dishes but with lower quality. Maybe we're spoiled by the delicious plates at Miku's.  Overall, we feel the food is a bit too overpriced for the quality.  Rating may go up if the food was priced more reasonably."}
{"text":"Server was knowledgable on her sake, she made some recommendation here and there . Momo tart is good too the other stuff are just alright."}
{"text":"Really good addition to the Baldwin st eatery. 

Mono San is not cheap but you will get delicious, creative and quality sashimi.  We ordered the day's special which was a platter of blue fin tuna, the Momo tart, spider roll and couple of pressed oishi.  I think the waiter up sold us on the blue fin tuna sashimi, I didn't think it was worth the price despite it being a premium fish flew in by air from Japan today. We really like the Momo tart and all the rest of our orders. Everything was very tasty and fresh.  Even though the price is a bit on the higher side compared to other establishments on Baldwin st but it's worth trying it out."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS

I ordered the Momo San signature plate which has 12 pieces of various sushi at $28.

The fish was pretty fresh overall and definitely better than most delivery sushi.

However, if your cravings don't need to be satisfied immediately, I'd recommend instead to go to Miku in person at lunch time. They have a very similar 12 piece set for $29 on their lunch menu and the aburi there in my opinion tastes better (less oily).

That being said, the signature plate at Momo San offers plenty of variety and is pretty tasty as well - not to mention, it's available at dinner time and for delivery too."}
{"text":"Another takeoff of a Japanese izakaya kingyo Nikki
Trying to pull off hakko sushi with non Japanese trained sushi chefs
Not worth he money
Quality is poor ...fish not comparable yo metro or takeout places
In other words...stay away from cheap non Japanese copies......"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic!  I went with two co-workers a few weeks ago and enjoyed every dish we ordered.  The hostess initially had some trouble seating us, mainly she seemed a bit confused with how to accommodate us around their reserved tables.  However, another gentleman ended up helping her figure out what to do and we were quickly seated.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.

I had the pork belly entree, momo tart, and their signature cocktail (I can't remember the name).  The cocktail was incredible, and but for the price $13, I would have ordered 4 more!  Really very delicious, the elderflower, lime, liqueur, really mesh well together for a sweet and tart, but smooth cocktail.  the pork belly entree was on the smaller side compared to the sushi or seafood noodle type entree my friend ordered.  But for one person, there is plenty of pork and you will be full.  My dish was on the cooler side temperature-wise, but the consistency and flavour of the pork was great.  The momo tart is a must have.  Big enough to share and delicious!  You may even want to order two.

I will definitely be returning to this restaurant and exploring their menu."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner because it was highly recommended by a friend. Totally worth the hype! 

We had 9 people and they reserved us a table on the patio. Their patio is so nicely decorated and perfect for a summer night outing. Food and drinks were served fast, and the service was helpful and friendly. 

Now the food. My friend ordered an Ebi fritter, OMG, the beer batter shrimp was mindblowingly good. It was juicy and packed with flavours! So was the momo tart and the calamari. Totally recommend the Calamari, Ebi fritter, Momo signature sushi plate, and the momo sour drink. Cuz it's my birthday, the bartender served me a special on-fire drink for free. Completely in love!!

We had an awesome time there! So glad to have a such quality Japanese place opening downtown! Definitely going back and recommend to all!"}
{"text":"The food is great and staff was very friendly and accommodating, able to provide off menu vegetarian options for my friend when we were there. The decor was very modern and sleek, we enjoyed our time there. 5 star keep up the good work looking forward to see improvements in the future since this place is new."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday with my friend. The food was pretty good, especially the Momo Tart which I liked a lot. However, the service is pretty poor as some others have pointed out here. The place is definitely understaffed - most of the servers were running around the whole time and they kept apologizing to everyone for not being more attentive. However, there was also one server who had a really bad attitude.

I waited 25 minutes after they seated me to get a cup of water and get my table cleaned. Then it took another 20 minutes to get our first dish. Towards the end of our meal, we wanted to get a refill of our tea but the server never came back to our area. Once we finally got the chance to ask for a refill, the server took the tea pot but never came back, until we chased down another server and asked where our tea was.

I understand that this is a new restaurant so they probably underestimated how busy it would be. Hopefully they can train their servers better and hire more staff."}
{"text":"Only thing I would recommend here is the momo tart, which I must admit is worth the price, but everything else I tried is so overpriced. The salmon pressed sushi was not creamy enough and you could taste the individual grains of rice; I prefer the one at Kinka Izakaya (which I think is cheaper too).

The low rating is also for the service. At the time that I went, there were sooo many waiters/waitresses available (not doing anything at all except talking to eachother), and not that many customers, so I don't understand why it took 15 minutes for someone to attend to us, and another 45 minutes to get all of our food. We also had to ask 3 different servers for our bill before we got it. Keep in mind that we went and stayed pretty late so the restaurant was not busy at all. 

I might come back for the momo tart, but would probably get take-out if I could."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but like others have said, the value isn't worth it for the quality and quantity. I ordered the Momo tart and it wasn't filling at all. The ratio of rice to raw fish isn't worth $15 in my opinion, you would get twice as much in a poke bowl. Mind you I'm not a big eater so I can't imagine how disappointing it must be for other people who need bigger portions. As for the taste, it was pretty good but nothing impressive or left me craving more. I think I rather spend a little more for Jabistro or Miku or get the same quality at Guu for less.

I would be willing to give it another try if they review their menu again but until then, you'll catch me eating sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"The sushi here was delicious....their pressed sushi is better than the rolls.  The soba noodle salad was ok but the \"tart\" is divine!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this sushi bar to find out I can't order anything on the specialty Sushi or Sashimi platters.

Very embarrassing for a sushi bar.

I have have called them over 20 times to make reservations or different days, no a single call went through.

Customer  service was slow."}
{"text":"Pretty packaging... but lacking in substance.

I've been here once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch was a better experience than dinner.

ATMOSPHERE: 
Interior decoration is beautiful and modern. Mostly black interior, the vibe is no doubt high end. However, some of the seating upon visiting - found wanting. The circular booths are VERY uncomfortable. If possible, I'd recommend sitting at regular tables. The circular booths - which unfortunately takes up most of their front dining space - LOOK cool but they are really small/cramped, and zero back support. I sat in one of the booths at my first visit, and before the meal was over, my back was aching and I was shifting uncomfortably in my seat and just wanted to get out of there! Not exactly the best mindset to have when you're trying to enjoy a meal with friends.

SERVICE:
Consistently good service. Very accommodating and responsive service during both visits/meals.

FOOD:
Beautiful presentation. Every dish is impeccably presented. Reminiscent of JaBistro and Miku - in presentation only. Flavour was a hit and miss. The best dishes were all the dishes with \"Momo San\" in its name. I guess you put your name on the best! The rest I found was lacking in quality and quantity.

PRICE:
Expensive. As others mentioned, quantity is small, and since flavour/quality isn't amazing - it just makes each dollar you spend... more expensive. The charge prices like Miku, but definitely not the same quality.

Okay, if you really want to try. Again - the presentation is beautiful, and the space is kind of cool. But if you want good quality fish, there are plenty other restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10 on Canada day long weekend. It was a holiday weekend and they were severely under staffed. We had reservations but waited 30 minutes to be seated. We waited for someone to help rearrange our table (there were 3 separate tables) but no one came after 10 minutes. We ended up moving everything ourselves. 

Food was good...when it finally came. We basically ordered 2-3x everything on the menu except for dessert. Tables around us were complaining that they've been waiting over 30 minutes for dessert and many of them ended up cancelling their order and leaving. 

Our main server was good and apologized for the wait (I didn't get his name but he made the drink menu!). He felt bad and gave us a free round of shots (which were really good!). The other servers that came by weren't so great - kept forgetting basic requests like water, cutlery, and wasabi. 

As much as the restaurant is about the food, it's also about the experience. Likely won't be returning when there are places like JaBistro and Miku (who also serve aburi sushi) who have it figured out."}
