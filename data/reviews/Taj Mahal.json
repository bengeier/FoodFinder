{"text":"I rarely write reviews but just had to give one for taj.  I like ordering for pick ups for days I don't want to cook. They have an option to order online for pick-up and you can even choose the time you want to pick it up.  I like this option since I don't have to pronounce or spell out the dishes over the phone which I think can lead to order mix ups.  My orders were ready on time, and the owners are awesome and even gave me a complimentary biryani.  I love their saag!  I can't comment on their dine in service but for people living in the north hill areas, this is a great pick up/ take out place and you'll prevent the food smell sticking to your clothes which are hard to avoid."}
{"text":"So glad Taj Mahal has a dinner buffet tonight... we LOVE this place and has been craving it for weeks!"}
{"text":"This place is new to the area, and we took a chance and tried it! If you are looking for an authentic Indian place with food that surpasses expectation, this is it!"}
{"text":"An awesome value. Ten bucks for all the home cooked Indian food you can eat. that was the kind of lunch that makes me want to go on yelp and wright a review."}
{"text":"This place has the rudest servers. As a family of four, we went there late afternoon so that we don't bother people without kids during regular dinner time. They jammed us in a small table. We wanted to sit at a bigger table but the server said he was waiting for a large group. There were 3 large tables and all 3 large tables were empty while we were jammed in a small table early afternoon. Of course, lying rude servers get no tip. Don't ever go there, these people should not run a business."}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy this place but it has gone down hill.  Last time we ate there I got very sick after.

Also, they were very pushy, brought us stuff we didn't order and there was stuff on our bill the we did not order or get that we had to have taken off. We could over hear the same thing going on at other tables.

We won't go back."}
{"text":"I woke up this morning dreaming about spicy tandoori and garlic naan.  The Taj Mahal is amazing - extensive menu (~246 items) and fabulous food.  I went on a Friday night and it was busy (don't go if you are in a rush).  It is also bring your own beer\wine; conveniently there is a beer shop next door.  This has quickly become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"The owner was drunk and he kept shouting what do you want to eat.he got our order mixed up but he is a nice guy just some times nope hope u liked this review thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Our Server Freddy was awesome! We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I've had around the Pittsburgh area. Anytime we go in the staff is super friendly and prompt. The food is fresh, hot and delicious. A lot of different choices offered on the buffet, including a lot of vegetarian options. The food is the right amount of spice. I was never a fan of Indian food until I tried Taj Mahal and now I go as much as I can."}
{"text":"My husband really wanted Indian food since we do not have a place in our town that serves it, so we read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give Taj Mahal a try.  Wow!! This place is amazing!  We were greeted by the owner as we walked in.  He was extremely personable and very welcoming.  We ordered the chicken tikka marsala and garlic naan.  The food was incredibly flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  After the meal, my husband said this was the best meal we have had on vacation, so far. If you like Indian food, I would highly recommend Taj Mahal."}
{"text":"decent north indian food - pleasant owners - sticky floor - went there 3 years ago and didn't go back"}
{"text":"Phenomenal - I never leave reviews but Taj Mahal is so good that I must. I live in New York in a plethora of fantastic Indian food. My brother has been raving about this place for months and I can honestly say that it's probably the best Indian food I've ever had. Get the butter chicken!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, like water-down Indian food! The tandoori did not tast like tandoori at all, in fact it was flavourless! The basmati rice too, just bland. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very much like home made Indian food. Service is slow but as long as they keep the quality I am ok."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Would have given 5 stars if they had samosas but they didn't have any - granted it was a Sunday night! Everything was delicious.  Owner was very helpful and accommodating.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will come back next time we visit this area!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers: the owner was very friendly and inviting. He made us feel at home. Moving from Florida not more than two weeks ago, I'm still very used to that Southern hospitality, but I didn't miss it at all here! We ordered chicken, lamb and an eggplant veggie dish. It was all so incredible! The owner stopped by several times to ask if we needed anything, and even treated us to a delicious complimentary dessert! Do yourself a favor and have dinner here! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. Anyway, I thought the curry was a little...watery? Runny?? Couldn't quite put my finger on it but it wasn't the creamy, scrumptious curry I am used to. It beats most other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh but that doesn't say much. There's a lot to be desired. The naan was pretty good and my lassi was okay if a little thick for my liking. Not outstanding but not terrible either. (We did not do the buffet) My boyfriend thought it was decent and I'd guess he'd rate it 3 or 3.5 stars if he had a Yelp."}
{"text":"Would give it negative stars if that is even a thing. Went there on Christmas...given it was one of the few places open. 
Short story: Worst chicken biryani ever, rude and crass customer service, charged us more than what the bill was. 
Long story: The server who sat us down was a soft spoken person. So far so good. Then comes in a loud, over the top, trying to be cool Indian dude to take our order. Says with attitude that they don't have fish pakora....fakes writing down our menu and then makes us repeat it three times. We let it go but by this time, the arrogance of this person is clearly visible. Since we had a toddler with us, we order pulao for the toddler. Mr. Arrogance then asks us the spice level (since we have a toddler with us, we explicitly say mild for the pulao)...to which he arrogantly says he meant about all the other dishes we ordered. (His tone sounded like we have never eaten at restaurants and apparently don't know how to order food off a menu). Anyway, it takes a long time for our main course to be served. The biryani is a mushy mix of rice and chicken curry. Small portions of food for the price.
Worst was the behavior of the host...he made snide rude remarks to one of our friends, taunted our friends's wife about what a pity it is that she was married to our friend, repeatedly kept asking the same question about where we are from, made arrogant comments about how we were kicked out of California and hence landed in Scottsdale, made an attempt at hugging the toddler without anybody's permission. There is a whole lot more nonsense and misbehavior that im not even writing down (yelp already says it's a long review). At the end of the whole drama, when we voiced our displeasure, his last snide comment was \"thank god I fed you\". We also witnessed him misbehaving with the server who first sat us down. Dude, if you are the owner who did this: no words for you. If you are the owner and that guy was one of your staff: it would be shameful if you still have him on payroll."}
{"text":"This is the third Saturday in a row I've had an Indian buffet and was delighted to find this one even better than the last! The selection was huge and they were able to keep everything fresh, filled and inviting. The crowd was very diverse and included many young Indian families with well behaved children. No offense intended - this is one of the ways I judge the authenticity of ethnic cuisine. There are plenty of tables ranging in size from two seats to round tables of 6-8. I tried a lamb and peas dish that tasted better than it looked. The baby eggplant was also yummy and the tofu with broccoli was a spicy surprise. The buffet staples did not disappoint. They had plenty of hot naan where the last two buffets brought it to the table after you were seated. They also had two other types of breads that I'm sorry not to be able to give a title to other that, yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious meal! We ordered onion bhaji (sp?), lamb tiki masala and a spinach eggplant dish. Everything was super tasty! My husband also enjoyed some garlic naan with the meal - I did not b/c I have to be gluten free. We're only in town for a few days, but we're hoping to fit in another visit to sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food in AZ. Have been here multiple times- quality is always spot on perfect. Service is great. Gil is a fantastic owner and always makes us feel at home. Cannot say enough good things. Fantastic vegetarian/vegan options as well."}
{"text":"Best place to get authentic Indian food in the North Hills area! I've been here on multiple occassions and ordered a variety of different lamb and goat dishes and more, and they were all excellent. The menu selection is huge. I have yet to have their lunch buffet, but I hear good things!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, ample portions, lots of variety, good food. Personable owner stopped by our table several times to check on us. Free parking in nearby garage. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A snowy Sunday screams for tasty comfort food. For me, that's Indian. I love the Taj Mahal Buffett. They have a wide variety of dishes from the standard Indian dishes to ones I've never eaten before prior to coming to this Buffet. The food is deliciously spiced, fresh, and of high quality. I think it was 12-13$- which included a pop. An excellent value for delicious food."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness!!

Dinner here tonight was Amazing! The owner (Gil) made the evening Fabulous and SO entertaining...The place is a little get away that has Awesome Indian food in Old Town Scottsdale! I had the Pakora Masala which was great and the Garlic Naan was delicious...If you haven't tried Indian food or want a new place to dine this is it!"}
{"text":"My first experience of Indian food and it was fantastic! My boyfriend has had Indian food and the next closest option is somewhere in California!! The owner is fantastic and the chicken tikka masala is to die for."}
{"text":"I am not familiar with Indian food, so to me the food was pretty delicious, 4 star.

Serving was also fine, just a little bit slow. 4 star too.

I already recommended this place to my Indian friends."}
{"text":"From the GOAT, rice and potatoes...to the fabulous spices and bread-all the side dishes and the main dishes and dessert-you will never leave unsatisfied or hungry!!!!
Great staff and priced just right for the lunch buffet"}
{"text":"We went here because we were craving Indian food and were going to be in the area. We landed here on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm. It was a buffet day, which was great because we'd never been to The Taj Mahal before and we were looking forward to trying all they had to offer. I haven't been in Pittsburgh long & I'm still on the hunt for a great Indian restaurant. The place was about 1/3 full, which we figured was a good sign. The food on the buffet was hot and fresh. There was a lot of variety and mostly the food was tasty, even if it wasn't as spicy as I would have hoped. 

That said, I will never, ever go back. The service was absolutely awful! At first the hostess tried to seat us at a table where there was no way for me to get into the chair since it was so close to the table & chair behind it. The guy that was at the table nearby even gave the hostess a look that, to me, seemed to say, 'you're kidding, right?' At 5'4\" and under 150 pounds, I don't require much space, but there was no way I was going to squeeze into & out of that seat without bumping into the guy behind me every time I got up to go to the buffet. We asked for a different table, which didn't seem to be a huge problem, but the hostess was determined to seat us at a 2-seater even though the place wasn't even half full. The many tables that were waiting to be cleaned off made that impossible to do right away. Thus, we waited patiently for her to clean a table, even though we were standing by 3 perfectly clean (& set) 4-seater tables. After that, she was just plain rude to us. We sat down & waited for a while, but nobody came by to bring flatware or napkins or offer menus. So, we walked over to the buffet, helped ourselves, and picked up some flatware from a neighboring table. Still no drinks though... We grabbed a few glasses from a nearby table and put them on our table hoping that one of the people that kept walking through the dining area w/ water pitchers would fill them. Still no luck. That darn hostess, who was now pointedly ignoring us, even replaced the glasses on the table next to us & STILL DID NOT BRING US WATER or offer any drinks at all. It wasn't until I spotted a cart full of water pitcher and went to fill our glasses myself that an very kind, matronly woman offered to do it for me. We did get one table-side refill, but I eventually ended up going to get a water pitcher & bringing it to our table before we left. We were here 45 minutes, tops. We could not get out of there fast enough.

To round out the awful service, the place is filthy. The walls are dirty. The black tablecloths were covered in curry & various sauces. The salt & pepper shakers on our table looked like they hadn't been cleaned in ages (very glad we had no need of them). The buffet was clean & tidy! However, the floor was covered in food from one end of the restaurant to the other. Lastly, vacated tables sat there dirty for far too long. Tables that were waiting to be cleared when we came in were just getting cleared as we were paying our check.   

The search for a great Indian restaurant continues."}
{"text":"Great food.  I normally use as my \" go to\" take out place. The owner Gil is a good guy and you can tell he takes pride in his restaurant. He wants people to enjoy the food.  All the dishes are tasty and always get a side of the Indian flat bread."}
{"text":"First visit today at the suggestion of a friend who's a regular. Had the lunch buffet which was delicious hot and carefully prepared."}
{"text":"Service was awesome and personal. We were thankful they were open on Christmas Day. We come to the area every year and will be back for sure. Delicious. Best Indian we have had in all of Arizona!"}
{"text":"Ok this was my fist time going there. from outside coming inside i told myself this place will get 5 stars from me. Once I went in no one came to greet us. As a fist time goer in I was not sure if just sitting anywhere was ok or not. So i thought i will give 4 stars in hopes of seeing change next time when I visit this place. The food was good. Ate maybe few too many calories but i don't feel guilty. Anyway At the end I left tip for the busser. I paid and also left tip on the table for the busser. As i was exiting i saw the owner's wife taking the tip from the table. The restaurant is busy $5 will not make anyone rich yet don't understand why the hell she had to take the tip that was clearly meant for the worker not the owner. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am from the Washington DC area and have taken a trip to Pittsburgh recently for my job.  I am constantly on the road for travel and  have eaten at many Indian restaurants in the northeast area. Some good, some bad, but this is by far the best I've ever had. The buffet offerings are plentiful, but don't confuse quantity with a lack of quality. I had the chicken vindaloo, chicken biryani and curry goat along with Basmati rice and it was all excellent (w/ fresh ingredients). Considering this, I didn't even touch the surface of what the buffet had to offer; and all for under $9 per lunch buffet! Wanted to sample more of their offerings, but I was stuffed from the meal that I had. if you are ever in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend going to Taj Mahal. You will not be disappointed by the food experience.
D."}
{"text":"We had been going to Taj Mahal for 11 years until tonight. Hundreds of dinners, all good. Tonight was the 11th anniversary of our relation to Pittsburgh, so we went to Taj Mahal to celebrate. Since we were last there, something changed. Maybe they sold the place. Maybe they changed chefs. I don't know. Regardless, what happened once we arrived was really unforgivable. First off, they got our order wrong. They brought an appetizer, and it was the wrong one. We corrected them, they brought another, and it was still wrong. We ate that one out of desperation. Then they brought the entrees. The taste of both if them was mediocre at best. They brought my wife's lassi, and that was pretty awful. My chicken korma had almost no korma sauce, served in a very shallow dish, a dish much smaller than my wife's tikka masala. I asked for more sauce, they said sure, but it never arrived. We decided to leave and pay the bill. I took the bill to the register, and the gentleman who had always been behind the register was there, as usual. He smiled when he saw me. I told him about the 11 year anniversary, he smiled again, and then I told him how awful the food was, how they got the order wrong, and how the portion was small. He didn't say anything. Now, there were any number of things he could have done. Apologize, offer to rip up the bill and comp the meal, ask me what it would take to get us to come back. Something. But he did nothing. He said nothing. He ran the bill, handed me the receipt and looked confused. It seemed like he was looking for someone to talk to, but I know that he is (or was) the owner. So I don't know what or who he was looking for. I paid the bill and left. We will NEVER be back. Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"Our first time at an Indian restaurant.  We had the buffet.  Everything was tasty, lots of unique items.  It was a great way to try a lot of different things without any pressure.  The poor waitress was running around like crazy, but she did a good job considering.  They need to have more than one waitress on hand during busy lunches."}
{"text":"First time picking up food from this place and it was a 10/10 on the Tiki Masala / Garlic Naan. Shook Gus' (the owner) hand who was extremely nice and welcoming. Will be back again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Come for the buffet. It's really very good.  A great selection of veggie options and lots of others.  (And yes, we're Indian food snobs).  I'd normally never give a5-start for a restaurant I've only been to once, but 1) their buffet is really in a different class, and 2) we'll have been there more than once in short order."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and it was fantastic! We ordered the chicken coconut special and the butter chicken special. Both dishes were aromatic and delicious! The chef/owner came out to visit and check on us during or meal. All the entrees are naturally  gluten free. I also have some other dietary restrictions and they were very accommodating! We will definitely be back! The atmosphere, service, and food were all excellent!"}
{"text":"Whoa, there.  \"Best Indian food in Pittsburgh,\" is excessive, as one reviewer commented.  I'm a sucker for Indian food -- and will eat Trader Joe's Chicken Tikki Masala when desperate -- but I also know good quality.  I saw Slumdog Millionaire, like, a hundred times.

Taj Mahal is okay.  3 stars.  The lunch buffet is a good spread with vegetarian options, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken tikki masala, tandoori chicken, saag, appetizers, and deserts.  But the food is only average -- I'm pretty disappointed with the tikki masala, because the chicken is dry and the sauce isn't that flavorful.  I know, I know, I said I eat Trader Joe's frozen dinners - but honestly, I think that has more flavor.

Mix up the goat curry with the saag - that was actually very tasty.

But for around $8-9, all you can eat, I'm pretty satisfied.  It is NOT great Indian food, but it is GOOD value, and should satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"I like the food and food choices at this restaurant. The variety is great and enables you to sample different flavors and level of spices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the US and Canada, and I've been all over both. I used to live down the street from Taj Mahal when I went to university in Montreal, and I ate there or got takeout pretty frequently. Last summer when I graduated, I had my graduation dinner there with friends and family. It's a tiny place so we took up most of the space and the staff and head chef were so accommodating. I couldn't have been happier! The food has always been consistently good. I am in LOVE with their butter chicken - I have yet to find another Indian restaurant that can do it so well. I also love their lamb curry and before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, their naan bread. Since going gluten free, I can still eat there, easily. I just avoid the naan and the samosas. All the curries and rice and lentil papadums, some other things (can't remember) are gluten free. I love it and make a point to eat there whenever I'm in Montreal. I live in Southern California now, where there is no shortage of good food, but Taj Mahal is still tops on my list."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC - I would travel to Pittsburgh just for the Indian buffet at the Taj, it's that good!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I have had in a long time.  So many vegetarian options! Vegetable Korma was AMAZING!  Owner and the rest of the staff were incredibly nice.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Popular destination, likely due to their buffet. Order from the menu in order to have a better taste of Indian delight. Their lamb chops, and goat curry are very good. The vegetarian selections are delectable especially Baingan Bharta and Bhindi Masala. The menu however is too big, which is problematic both to the diner and to the cook. I am not fan of very big menu, it dampens my enthusiasm. For the cook/chef, there is so much inconsistency: many times the food is very salty, and the curries tend to be watery,"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the weekend buffet for the first time yesterday and found that it satisfies both my desire for huge variety of veggie dishes and buttery palak paneer, and his for hot fresh breads and good meats. There was a mix of Northern and Southern Indian dishes. The butter chicken sauce wasn't all that (I've had better at India Garden, Maharaja, and Tamarind) but the rest was so good (they even had fresh crispy masala dosa on the buffet!). The goat curry was very tasty. I'm never a fan of going to Indian restaurants for table service, because I like the variety of buffet, so I can't really comment on how dinner service might be. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated, and the service was not unfriendly, our empty plates were cleared promptly, and I was able to get immediate attention when I wanted some tea. I'm sure this will become a favorite when we're in the North Hills."}
{"text":"I've been going to the taj since I was in middle school. They are my family's favorite and have only been improving over the years. We like to save time and go during the buffet and the chicken tikka masala is my favorite with mango pudding and honey balls to finish. Proud to have them in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the better ones around downtown area. I liked the buffett options. Thwy have a huge variety of food in the menu. I really like the pakodas and assorted appetizers. Gulab jamun, and mango pudding were near to perfection. In veggies I like malai kofta and veg korna. I didnt like mutter paneer at all. Peas were kind of little raw and paneer didnt seem to be fresh. Rest all was good. Honestly overall a decent place to be in. Will I be coming back? Well yes because overall food is satisfying.

PS: dont pay attention to ambience. You will drop one star from rating :p"}
{"text":"Excellent staff, large portions, amazing food. A definite yes if you are in the mood for some good Indian food."}
{"text":"BEWARE..... if you order take out, they WILL screw up your order. Always check before leaving. For example, no matter what kind of paneer you order, they will try to give you the green spinach stuff from the buffet.
I stopped going here because I'm so frustrated."}
{"text":"Ambience is better than a few restaurants we've been to. But the food is really spicy compared to other places for the same scale. We usually order 7 out of 10 spice level. That's what we did here, and darn, it was incredibly spicy!  Be careful, when you order. Lower your spice number by 2. If it is to spicy, ask for raita, a yogurt based dish that will calm your taste buds. Also, could try mango lassi! Yum! 

Service was fast. All the food came at the same time, except roti! Overall, satisfied. Oh btw, total around 246 items on the menu! Menu is like a small book!"}
{"text":"This place is waaaay overrated. The food is pricey, and just not that good. I'm a big fan of Indian, but this place is a huge disappointment. Stay away"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch Buffett.  Large variety and way more options than other Indian restaurants.  My favorite.  The Indian restaurant in Cranberry can learn a lesson from the Taj Mahal."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. The food is delicious. The vegetable coconut has a nice smoky flavor to it! The owner and staff are very kind and treat their customers right. The owner brought out a carrot pudding and it was very tasty, unexpected and my family and I loved it! Definitely recommend Taj Mahal!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants. They have a variety of vegetarian and vegan choices, as well as many meat dishes. 

You can easily drive past this place unless you know where it is (Right beyond Mad Mex and a Mattress store as you drive south on McKnight Road--before Ross Park Mall). They have a parking lot that fills up on weekend evenings, but you can park nearby without a problem. 

I love the owners of this restaurant. They are charming and very pleasant. They visit the tables and make sure guests are happy. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and friendly. We've had a few problems with not getting food we ordered or getting the wrong food. I chalk this up to the fact that the place is usually busy and little mistakes happen. They are quick and willing to correct mistakes. 

There is a buffet that most people seem to opt for. I see people making multiple trips with plates piled with their fragrant, steaming choices. The aroma makes my mouth water! Smells so delicious! We typically order from the menu because I'm a big fan of leftovers, which (like all places) you can't take if you visit the buffet.

During our last visit, the three of us--without discussion with each other--all ordered the chicken tikka masala. Something must have inspired us (the aroma of someone else's food?) and it turned out to be a great choice. The sauce was creamy with the perfect amount of spices. Not too overwhelming, not at all bland. Our friend who accompanied us is 2nd generation Indian and she gives it her hearty approval. She has dinner here with her parents fairly often. The nan was warm and tender--great for scooping up those last bits of sauce. 

Rather than eating at the many chain restaurants nearby, this is great choice for authentic Indian food. The service is prompt and the food is delicious. We always leave happy."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the owner was nice and the food was great. 

Like one of the previous post we were over charged by 25 dollars"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we've been here but it was so excellent.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The owner was warm, friendly, and attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I came back last week Friday bringing our 15yo grandaughter. The place was again not crowed but that isn't unusual for Scottsdale when high school football is in season. Parking this time was good we were only a few steps away from the door.  We were seated instantly at the same table as last time.  Gil came over and chatted with us. Gil mentioned that we should park in the back alley and come in that way next time. (He reads the reviews). We order more extensively this time as we trusted how the food would be.  Again excellent excellent.is the best way to describe Indian food done correctly.  We again ordered medium with hot sauce on the side so we could bring it up to the level each of us liked individually. Gil's wife was there and we chatted and found out she was also originally from N. Cal.  If you like real Indian food done perfectly this is the place for you..  Again we ordered additional food to go so I could have it another day."}

{"text":"Delicious food at moderate prices.  I don't go to Taj Mahal often enough.  I took my mom to Taj Mahal to warm up on a cold evening.  We had a delicious dinner of Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tiki Masala.  The naan was delicious and well made.  The portions were very generous, and while the service was somewhat awkward, they were very nice.  They ask how spicy you prefer your food (important with older moms in tow), and it was prepared perfectly.  It was obvious that the staff knew several of the repeat customers.  Honestly, this is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh.  I need to remember this when I can't decide where to eat!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was spectacular!  It was refreshing to have a waitstaff that was attentive to our specific allergy considerations.  The food itself was bursting with flavor.  Try the wings on the appetizer menu...they will not disappoint.  I paired my dinner with a Tajmopolitan mixed drink and it was superb.  Topped off the evening with their refreshing mango ice cream.  All-in-all a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Great buffet, naan, and curried goat. Nice selection of dishes and price point. Recommend."}
{"text":"A great gem in Old Town!! The food is delicious and authentic. Definitely try the naan bread!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in town, if not the best. The buffet is especially is worth the trip.

Recent renovations have taken the restaurant from being a bit sketchy looking to downright attractive. It's not completely done just yet, but it's getting very close."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant in south Scottsdale with a wide variety of cuisine, friendly to vegetarians and vegans and adjustable heat levels in most dishes. The owner came over to check in and make sure we were enjoying ourselves! Very thoughtful of him! Try the butter chicken if it's your first time and don't leave without a Mango Lassi and veg samosa! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian vegetarian food I had in the Eastern USA corridor. It's an all day buffet on weekends and is priced relatively cheap. 
The taste on the other hand is far above any standards you would set for yourself. 
The owner is also the chef and she is too sweet. 
I have had a splurge of food that day and could not stop eating. Be it south Indian/north Indian/indo-chinese/desserts,  you have it all. 
My pictures may not do justice but the quality of items is staggering. I don't have enough words to describe my feeling that day. 
Ambience is about average but who cares. 
I'm a foodie and I'd love to eat here every week. 
5 stars. !!!"}
{"text":"The meal tasted fine. The service was fine. However, I wound up very thirsty for the rest of the night, so MSG? Never heard of that being an issue with Indian restaurants, but there's always a first. 

I also got itchy ... and then it kicked up again the next night after eating leftovers, so it was definitely the food from here!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants across valley. 
I am a vegetarian and they don't carry many veggie options. But whatever they have tastes soooo good that I drive 1.5 hours just go eat food here. 
Mango lassi, mutter mushroom, saag, daal makhani all are delicious. Their Garlic Naans are the best ( and soft too)."}
{"text":"Writing all these reviews has made me realize how much we go out to eat!!  Nothing bad to say about Taj Mahal. Great food, great service and the mango lassi here is the best one around in my opinion. Nope, nothing bad to say about it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!   I don't think there is a better Indian restaurant than Taj Mahal. Excellent atmosphere, food is out of sight. Full bar, wine selection is good and for the quality this place is cheap. There were four picky women at the table and none of us could say one bad thing except we were too full!!  Don't even read a review if it's not a \"5\" those people have no clue. 
Frequent there often, we can't afford to loose a good restaurant like this."}
{"text":"The Taj Mahal is the closest place to Indian food for me...with that being said, I feel that their buffet has gone downhill a bit with the same selection each time I go. The best bet is to order off of the menu during a non buffet night. They do an amazing paneer kadhai and garlic naan. Also, make sure to order a mango lassi, as the Taj Mahal makes a great one, almost milk shake like!"}
{"text":"The lunch Buffet is wonderful, and the waitress was great;however, the man who took my check is a misogynist and treated my mother and I with disrespect. Unless you identify as a male, I suggest taking your  business to tamarind in warrendale for better customer service:)"}
{"text":"Really loved this place! Good ambiance and super friendly owner, very passionate about his restaurant! Loved the Chicken dishes, and very sweet complimentary desert he gave our table because they had just opened and were doing a promotion!

Only thing missing a full five stars....
small portion sizes at least for the rice especially!! It's one thing that it doesn't come with the meal but at least serve it in a bigger size.

Overall amazing food, location and service :)"}
{"text":"Best Indian place I've eaten in my life.  all you can eat for $9-10 is a steal :).  If you're looking for just a single dish - go with the chicken \"muckla?\"

The managers are also really nice and they gave us a box of free samosa-like thingies when picked an order to-go the other day; just so we would have something to eat while we were in the car and not go insane from just smelling the food."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food in Pittsburgh.  If you are not a fan of Indian food this place may convert you.  Lots of vegetarian options!!  I have been going for years and crave the food regularly, however it is not the healthiest choice.  It's worth the splurge!!!"}
{"text":"Their dinner buffets are an excellent place for those unfamiliar or starting off with Indian cuisine.  A huge variety of appetizers and entrees, both vegetarian and meat based, that are not spiced too hot, and are well suited to the average American palate.  However, for those experienced in ethnic dining, or if you want something more adventurous, you may want to try ordering off the menu on a non-buffet night. I'd recommend the chicken biryani, lamb vindaloo, chicken seekh kebab and the garlic naan. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Their buffet is scary good.  Scary because there is such a wide variety of delicious dishes that you can't help but go back for more, and more and more.

After going on Saturday night two weeks running, my wife and I decided that we would have to make this a monthly tradition or invest in a new wardrobe.

While there are quite a number of standard items on the buffet each week, they also change things up just enough to keep it interesting.

Everything is fresh, plentiful and well seasoned.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very good food.  Was very attentive to our needs.  Would definitely recommend and look forward to coming again in the future."}
{"text":"Food was good. Came an hour and  half before closing. Very pleasant until they discretely tried to hurry us up by giving us the check when I wasn't done eating yet. Still an ok place."}
{"text":"Their buffet and regular menu are very tasty. When ordering from the menu you can select the hot/spicy rating of your food 1-10, which i like. The buffet gave me a chance to see what my favorite foods are there. I love their endless white rice, chili chicken is very yummy, love the chick peas, veggie somosas, pita bread, and mango pydding. The servers are a little slower to come back to your table even when not too busy, but they give you time to decide your order. Very friendly staff though."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food everrrr. They brought us cold Kabab platers and it was made day before. When we asked, they lied to us. We are expert in Indian food and they tried to fool us. When we told them about our food being old, they didn't even offer to replace them. I would never recommend this restaurant. Also, portion is very small."}
{"text":"I love the buffet! My favorites are the veggie vindaloo and korma."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken tikka masala! Sizable, delicious, chicken pieces and not fatty. I've also had their food delivered though amazon restaurants, and it's always a perfect order with great taste and great temperature. Can't wait to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this food any higher I would.  I'm so glad they opened in Scottsdale! My daughter and I have driven to the Prescott location from Peoria several times just for lunch.  Hands down the best Indian food in Az. It's a beautifully decorated space and they have an extensive menu as well as excellent service.  Go. Eat. Enjoy! They're the best."}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet I've ever had. They don't cut corners or put out boring dishes just because it's a buffet."}
{"text":"Having eaten at a lot of Indian places across US, I would not recommend the chicken biryani. The portion was good. However this was bland chicken over rice and tasted awful. I had an order of samosa which was decent. Overall, this place is overpriced and really does no justice to Biryani. It's a joke for $16 on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow. Just Wow. I dream of Taj mahal at nights .... Sometimes I am just walking to school and I am haunted by the thoughts of Taj mahal... I wish I had a car so I did not have to wait for friends to go to this place. 
They have a great selection for the buffet and everything is just plain delicious (except they have a small selection of Chinese-inspired food too that I don't like; but it is not on them, I don't like Chinese food in general). Just do yourself good and go there. Make sure you go hungry because you want to eat a lot of food, even though you know you should not."}
{"text":"We were visiting Old Montreal in the middle of winter, and a lot of restaurants were closed.    There were 8 of us in the restaurant.  The place is very nice inside, not too formal and not too casual.  Exposed brick walls, nice lighting, etc.  The waiter was very professional and  polite.  The menu was extensive, and not the \"usual\" dishes seen at an Indian restaurant. We ordered oignon bhajee as an appetizer, which was so delicious!  I got  a curry dish, dupiaza with veggies, and my partner got saag with veggies.  As opposed to a typical Indian restaurant, these were not doused in sauce, and the veggies had a nice char taste to them and were SO delicious!  I couldn't stop eating!  We would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal exceeded our expectations! We are from out of town and brought our son to ASU. My husband and I have recently come to love Indian cuisine. I'm not one to write a review but we were so impressed we had dinner here twice in 3 days. 
Freddie our waiter was extremely attentive. We especially loved the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer. The Naan was hot and the best we've had! 
If this restaurant isn't busy when you go don't let it deter you. It's just a seasonal thing according to the owner."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for my lunch hour. Today I have a horrendous sinus infection causing me to cough continuously. The table busser noticed and brought me a dish of lemons to help sooth my coughing. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably the best curry we've had in the US.
Having lived in the UK where there's a great curry place almost everywhere, it is finally a pleasure to find one as good, right here in Scottsdale.
Their Prescott restaurant led us to this one in Scottsdale - both excellent."}
{"text":"The dinner buffet runs Monday, Thursday and Saturday. We came in on Thursday and it was pretty full. 

The buffet itself was magnificent, tons of platters laid out about. I have been told by Indian people this is the most authentic place in town.

Everything was really great! I wish the fried spinach was warm though,"}
{"text":"Food is great! I got lamb chops, very well marinated and taste very soft. But service could be better, since it's a restaurants. We called ahead to check if they have tables available and wanted to make reservation, they ignore it. When we came, place was full of people and the long line at the door. That's ok. We waited. Find hair in my appetizer... Wine was too warm. But very satisfied with my food! Probably will give another chance and visit this place someday again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch here last week.  Both of us are a little picky about Indian food because we eat it so much, and this place was a-okay in our book.  We had the business lunch special, which was a great value.  Enjoyed nice appetizers, a soup and a dish of lentil onion dumplings which I forgot the proper name of, followed by a Tandoori chicken and another curry dish, with naan and rice.  Included in our meal was a rice pudding dessert with coffee and tea.  Restaurant is nice and clean, and has a great location."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and the buffet is always great. Tonight was an off- night; some dishes were empty, there was no bread for a while, service was slow and overwhelmed.  Even on an off-night, though the quality of the food is very good."}
{"text":"I went here last night (11/26) and we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken. Both were exceptional. I finished the Tikka this morning and it was great left over as well. I've been to most indian restaurants in the greater Phoenix area and Taj Mahal takes the cake. I have not been to the same indian spot here twice, because I have not found one that to me was worth visiting again, but I will definitely be back to Taj. The owner and his wife were friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great, Had the yellow Lentil soup and Chicken Khorma, some of the best I've ever had.  Owner takes pride in his food and the place it shows."}
{"text":"The food was unreal! Staff was great, only positive things to say about this place. We have been searching for good Indian food in the valley and finally found it!"}
{"text":"Best naan bread ever!  Perfect amount of spice on the chicken tikki masala. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food WAS awesome UNTIL I saw the waiter refill  a USED chutney platter and give it to a new customer!   How many people dipped into our chutney and touched the spoons before us!  How many crumbs from other people were in it!  Almost threw up!  Will Never go back.  We can only wonder if your leftovers are recycled  ??????????"}
{"text":"My crew member and I are flight attendants on a layover here so we decided to try this place because we were craving Indian food. When we first walked in, the atmosphere is so calming, artsy, and peaceful. Our waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We ordered lamb/chicken curry with a couple of appetizers. It was sooooooo incredibly delicious !! The spices and flavor exceeded my expectations. I believe that you get what you pay for and it was worth every penny! I will definitely be back on my next layover :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, no questions asked.....  This is the best indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I've been here at least 100 times.  Always Fresh and Delicious!  The buffet is excellent, but not always available, Call First!  Newly Remodeled.  Beautiful Building."}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE!

Came here after a visit to the nearby \"Pop-up\"Ice Cream museum and the Owner is not only friendly but HILARIOUS!!

Staff was also super friendly and helpful given that they made good recommendations. The food was delicious - I had the Chicken Tikka Masala

To the owner of this establishment, please keep up the high quality of service and warm environment! Will be returning here often with more friends and family"}
{"text":"Food is ok. But service is terrible. Our table was wobbling and when asked to fix it or replace it the response lil weird as in there was nothing wrong. 
We were not even introduced with the names of our servers so I am not sure with the names but surely they were not very helpful. 
We end up in ordering some extra breads which was apparently funny for one of our waiter. After 3-4 times asking the same thing about breads, Joke wasn't funny honey. 
I would have appreciated more professionalism. 
Overall my experience was not very good and felt more bad as It was a day of celebration turned out to be a disaster."}
{"text":"So great to have a really nice Indian restaurant now in Scottsdale (we knew the Prescott location, and have enjoyed great food there too over the years). 

A good sign was that there seemed to be a continuous stream of Brits coming in for take outs, and one thing the British can do is sniff out the best Indian food!  Full disclosure- I am a displaced Brit currently living in Scottsdale always on the look out for good Indian culinary delights.

The food was excellent, I had the butter chicken which was perfectly spiced with good quality chicken.  Portion size was good, I managed to eat it all, but it was a push.  Kristina had a lamb curry, very very spicy which she needs (due to dulled down taste buds after too much hot Thai food in her youth!). 

Sandy, the friendly owner, served us and we chatted about this, that and Basis. We are so happy that the restaurant has opened in Scottsdale, and will be regulars. Highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"As background, I'm Indian and both my parents are amazing chefs. I've also eaten Indian food in the best cities in the country. So I think I can say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to anywhere. The meats are very well marinated and the spices are the perfect complement. The attention to detail with the flavors is amazing. There is only one other restaurant in the city that compares. It's seriously hard to find good Indian food in PHX for some reason, but I have to say that this is one of the best I've been to anywhere!"}
{"text":"I never thought much about this Indian restaurant the many times I have eaten there before, but after the last time I don't think I will ever return. Not only is the food consistently lame - the vindaloo just average, the tikka masala lacking any savory quality at all, and the naan, OMG, I've had much better frozen from the Indian grocery and fresh from my toaster oven that there's!!! - but the Service has gone from bad to worse. Firstly, for some reason every time I order it takes a long time for the food to come out of the kitchen, no matter how busy the place is. And every time I come in, I'm always rushed to a table like there's some big hurry. But this time the lady that waited on us was very rude. When my friend asked her what was a popular dish there, she said everything on the menu is popular. No help or direction, which for the uninitiated can be confusing. Then, throughout the meal, she was barely attentive. When I asked one of the other servers for sugar for my ice tea, he seemed immediately offended that I interrupted him. And when he brought the sugar, he just abruptly dropped it on the table as he walk by and said the word sugar. Then at the end, it took forever for the lady to bring us the bill. Swift with bringing me my change, she actually came back and took her tip off the table before we left!"}
{"text":"i cut hair for a living and my clientele is 50 percent Indian. I always talk about Indian food with them because I LOVE it, and ask where they think the best place to go is.  They always mention Taj Mahal.  I finally went there after a disappointing meal from Mintt, and Indian food took on a whole new meaning.  Everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH and the service was great and friendly.  The inside is cheerful and the prices were super reasonable.  Flavor was complex and interesting; quality cuts of chicken; papadam and vegetables good and portions were good.  I have heard the buffet is great -- I think they only have that on weekends for lunch, but don't quote me on that.  Definitely the best Indian in Pittsburgh, despite the fact that it is on (horrible) McKnight Road -- only drawback.  I used Waze to take me there and it didn't know the exact location -- it is on the same side of the street and a few doors away from Mad Mex.  Also, all my Indian clientele say their desserts are fantastic and authentic, not like the other restaurants. I don't eat sugar/gluten so can't speak for it, but wanted to pass that info along."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time as part of a group. The buffet had a decent selection and the food tasted pretty good. However, I felt a bit sick and my stomach felt like it was going to explode. It merely could have been because I over ate, but I've been to plenty an Indian buffet where I've stuffed myself with no regrets. While the food wasn't bad, it didn't stick out as being significantly better than other places I've tried. While the service was decent, my first experience here wasn't the best. That said, I would be willing to try again and next time I'll either eat slower or not as much."}
{"text":"This food is amaaazing! I love the exotic flavors! Try the buffet if available. If not, try vegetable nav rattan shahi korma or one of the other vegetarian delights - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Dinner buffet is Mon, Thurs and Sat. They have lunch buffet everyday. I came Thursday evening. Buffet was so good, it took me twice as long to eat because I was raving about the food between each mouthful.  Literally. Everything was tasty and wonderful. Lots of choices. I would come back in a heartbeat, and plan to."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good Indian restaurant for
some time. This is a good location and parking on a
Wednesday was good. It is in old Scottsdale. The food
Was very good samosas were light and full of flavor
Aloo gobi was great there were some tomatoes in it
But they were full of great flavor. Chicken tikki masala
Was excellent. Good selection of dishes and great light
Naan. The selection of naan is great. Service was very
Good and our server was Freddie a very jovial guy we loved it and plan to return."}
{"text":"So I saw this place was hot and new so I went with my family for dinner. It's in a really nice part of town and has a REALLY nice building, with great scenery and at night the carriage rides go right by here. The wait was really long for the food to cook after we were seated, but it was SO GOOD! Probably some of the best Indian food I've ever had. We tried a lot of different things and it was all amazing, but I say order the Paneer Masala! Best thing we had! Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options too, definitely go try it if you have time and love Indian food."}
{"text":"Tasty lamb vindaloo, tasty naan. They ran out of the IPA I was drinking and brought over two small samples of other suggestions, completely unprompted. Now that's service. Owner came out and said hi too!"}
{"text":"My bad it was seasoning very sorry looks like a bug please forgive me..ill be back for more food went back today she showed me season when cooked look like a insect.and again forgive me.thats all folks"}
{"text":"Great Indian food!  We drive all the way from Gilbert and it's worth it. Not only is their food delicious, Gill the owner is personable and engages with his customers. You feel as if you are eating with family. 
Recommendations:  chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and their briani rice (apologize if spelling is off)."}
{"text":"We are transplants to AZ from the tech NW where there are an abundance of great Indian restaurants that cater to the Indian IT crowd.  But after discovering Taj Mahal in Scottsdale we feel this is by far the best we have ever experienced. The spice blends are awesome and the rich flavors are the best. Can't go wrong with chicken tikka masala and aloo gobi. Worth the drive from Oracle for us."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife last night for a nice dinner. I was not disappointed. The staff was attentive and friendly. We started off with a vegetable platter which had ample portions. (I would probably try something else next time.) for dinner I ordered you chicken buhna. I really enjoyed it and thought it was good for dipping my garlic naan in. My wife ordered a vegetarian dol dish that she really liked. That was also good for dipping. I would come back."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times in the past for ordering off the menu as well as to eat from the buffet.  All of our visits were generally very nice (well, except for one waiter who tried to correct us when ordering, telling us to order something different cause we wouldn't like what we ordered), and we usually prefer the variety of their nice buffet which is now available every night. 

Anyhow, we hadn't been in a few years, knew they had gone through a remodel, and wanted to use our B1G1 from the Entertainment book....so off we went on a Friday evening at 6:30PM.  First of all, the exterior is much nicer and the interior looks very similar but with a much-needed upgrade to this decade. It isn't overly fancy or sophisticated and you won't find an ambience where you are inclined to chill for a few hours (they don't have a bar, no surprise) but it is much improved and nice.

We seated ourselves and had prompt and friendly service for the whole meal. Water was always kept full and they quickly answered any questions we had about their MASSIVE new menu (probably 8-10 pages front and back).  You get a free plate of Papadum (some tasty thin crackers) with some dipping sauces/ flavors. We ordered the Naan bread basket (way too much for 2 people!, pretty buttery), Shrimp Saagwala (request 5 level heat), and  Chef's special Biryani. They were all delicious, very flavorful, nicely presented, and HUGE portions. The shrimp turned out to have little spice heat, but the Biryani was pretty darned spicy. We could only eat half the bread, and maybe half of each entree.

No issues with the Entertainment card, and both the server and the owner thanked us for coming in.  I do miss the communal tip jar at the door that they used to use, but everything else is still great. 

Anytime I need some great affordable Indian food or want to hang out with the local NPR crowd (never seen so many long beards, tweed jackets, and hybrid cars in the North Hills in awhile), this will be where I go."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant in old town Scottsdale... and in Prescott.  The chicken tikka masala (spicy level 2), garlic naan, and rack of lamb is my go-to order.  Everything smells amazing and someday I will branch out.  If you haven't been this is a must try spot.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love the buffet because I can try some of everything! Malai kofta (usually my fav) was eh, but really enjoyed several other options."}
{"text":"Oh my god! I cannot say enough about this place!

The staff has been there a long time and incredibly friendly! They always recognize me and ask how I am when I come in! Food is EXCELLENT and vegetarian friendly options! 

Of all the Indian places I've tried across the nation they have the absolute BEST vegetable korma I've ever tried. I'm serious I have dreams about it!"}
{"text":"Great samosa , and quality North Indian Punjabi style restaurant. Host is very Friendly! New find on the Indian restaurant radar and definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"Literally best Indian food I've ever had. Chicken tikka masala was on point! The owner was amazing and made a point to make sure everything was perfect. I will definitely be making another trip back here asap!"}
{"text":"Just tried to walk in at 3:30 and got stared at for a couple minutes straight and told they were closed and to leave. Extremely awkward"}
{"text":"A bit pricey. It was $13 for my chana masala entree which did not include bread or rice. But the food is wonderful and the vegan and vegetarian options are fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a second location to Gill's Prescott, Arizona one. I have loved Indian food for over 20 years and this is the tastiest anywhere!!
The buttery and creamy Chicken Tikka Masala is on point although ad a little heat and it makes it that much better. You can not find more fun hosts and great crowds as well. I highly recommend you try the food here Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"A must-eat when in Scottsdale!  The owner is incredibly friendly and accommodating.  The service was great.  The food was out of this world!  My husband ordered the lamb vindaloo, basmati rice, and we shared the garlic naan bread.  As a pilot, he eats Indian all over the US.  He said this place is by far his favorite.  Overall, excellent experience!"}
{"text":"It was the worst Indian food i had tasted in my 28 years of proudly being an Indian... I know this restaurant has attracted lot of local people but being an Indian, I just cannot tolerate the quality and taste of food served here.

Me and my wife visited this restaurant for dinner on a Monday evening. We are vegetarians but am sure my non-vegetarian friends would have cursed more than am doing now. 

Every dish was either toooooo oily or toooooo buttery ... the taste was same ranging from veg pakora to channa chat to malai kofta to Vegetable kuruma and even palak panneer was tasting the same... 

The best i liked was raita and achar (pickle)... it was atleast edible and i enjoyed my raita rice towards the end of my main  course... 

You would be surprised to hear from me, mango pudding was 200% thicker version of Mango lassi served in any Indian restaurant in US. And the jamun was probably prepared when my granny passed away 10 years back... 

The restaurant is cramped and not enough space to walk around either.. In all, i really feel sad that Americans living here in Pittsburgh are tasting a false face of Indian cuisine... People please dont conclude this is Indian food.. write to me if you really want to try some good indian food.. I will suggest you good places..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we are new to Indian cuisine. Not an adventurous diner, I had a surprisingly pleasant experience last spring with a friend at a restaurant in Oakland, and have been wanting to try more. I finally talked my husband into trying still another Indian place, using a Groupon, and he was also intrigued. We are always hearing about Taj Mahal from friends who are more familiar with the cuisine, so we finally made time to get there on a night when their famous buffet was available. 

Frankly, I was a little disappointed. First, it was SO LOUD. There was a huge party of folks with a bunch of small kids who were running around, playing and yelling to each other. Kids will be kids, and I know that's not the restaurant's fault, but the noise level was a little unnerving. Conversation, unless we wanted to yell louder than the surrounding diners, was impossible. The greeting from the staff- and that's the best phrase I can find for it- was, well, weird. We had never been there before. We don't know what's expected- do you go find a seat? Do you wait to be seated? Do you grab a plate and jump in? What? A tall guy in a white chef's jacket kind of pointed at us from across the room, as we were standing uncertainly amongst people shoving to get out the door or to the buffet- and held up two fingers, asking how many were in our party. When we nodded, he then pointed in the direction of the back of the room. We kind of wandered back to what looked like an empty table. There was silverware and glasses, but the table looked as though it hadn't been wiped after the previous guest. We then sat for a bit until someone came and poured water for us, and said we could go to the buffet when ready. The buffet, though laden with delicious foods, was confusing and intimidating. We had to search for plates, which were in the middle of the line, so people are pushing around and reaching to get what they're looking for. Maybe that's just how buffets are done in Indian restaurants? As I said, we're new here. Eventually we both got an assortment of dishes to try, and the food was delicious. There were LOTS of choices, including desserts and breads, and everything was hot and freshly cooked. I really love chicken tikka masala, and the tray was almost empty when I got there, but a new tray came out soon. Everything was refilled constantly, fresh from the kitchen. I wanted to try a buffet so we could sample several things. That worked out well (though i really need to take notes next time so I remember what dishes I really liked!) The water glasses were magically refilled all the time, and I asked for a soda, which was delivered promptly. When we were finished, we sat for a while, unsure if the check would be brought to us or if we were to just pay at the counter- which seemed to be what others were doing. I think just having staff trained to pay attention and offer guidance when customers don't seem to know what to do or where to go would help a lot. And would their faces break if they cracked a smile? Sheesh!

I really, *really* wanted to love this place. I wanted to be able to agree with my friends who rave about it. But... well, not just yet. My husband isn't interested in going back but maybe I'll give it another try with those friends, see if we were just there on an off night."}
{"text":"What a great gem if you're on this side of Pittsburgh - even if you're in the area and don't mind a fifteen minute drive or so.  As one in love with Indian cuisine, the Taj Mahal is surely as grand as it sounds.  The staff is all so nice and regularly freshen the buffet.  The decor consists of very beautiful embroidered cloth, adding to the warm ambience of the place.  The buffet offers typical delicacies like a vegetable korma and tikka masala, but offers such a variety and even some dishes I haven't had the chance to try at other restaurants or buffets.  The saag - as I love any green dish - was delicious and absolutely my favorite; paired well with naan of course.  There were some very tasty veggie dishes as well as fresh vegetables and spinach salad with an interesting sauce.  I didn't have a chance to try the dosas or coconut chutney but these dishes looked amazing!  The Taj Mahal also has a sweet dessert bar, including a very yummy mango pudding.  I'm looking forward to visiting again, perhaps ordering from their extensive and informative menu.  My father and I had a splendid time here - a satisfying meal to chat for hours over."}
{"text":"We love good Indian food and this place is a wow! The butter chicken is maybe my favorite food period. We ordered it with medium spice and that was great for us. The basmati rice was really good as well as the service. We will be regular here!

Our second time here was fantastic as well really enjoyed the Flying Horse beer with dinner."}
{"text":"Just ate here upon the recommendation of my boyfriend. Great buffet!! So many different quality choices and everything was delicious! I'm vegetarian and there was a variety of vegetarian and vegan food on the buffet."}
{"text":"Lived in Asia for 15 years and very picky about Indian food. Absolutely delicious and fresh. Our new \"go to\" spot! Will be here weekly."}
{"text":"We should have known better to patronize a restaurant that has no one in it during dinner time on Saturday night in the heart of Old Scottsdale.  We were the only ones in the place, when another party arrived and were seated right next to us in this huge establishment.  The ambience was that of a night club, with strobing cord lighting under the bar, which was annoying.  The only piece of decor that alluded to being in some sort Indian restaurant was the stencil design on the brick wall.  Everything else screamed leftovers of some sort of defunct restaurant.

With only two tables in the restaurant, both orders for each party were completely messed up.  Not sure how this could happen....it's not like the place was busy!  

The whole experience was very odd, especially for a restauranteur with experience (they have a restaurant in Prescott).  First was the question about the garlic naan, and if it was too greasy after we started eating it.  Then the shenanigans with the wrong orders.  As soon as the food was placed on our table and we served ourselves, the man who may have been the owner walked over and said \"yes, that's not the chicken\" and went back to the kitchen.  Huh?  So what are we eating?

What took it over the level of \"gross\" was when one of the male wait staff came over to ask if he could taste one of the main courses we had on our table....then immediately grabbed the large spoon and dripped some of the sauce in the center of his hand and LICKED IT! \"Yes, that's the Coconut Lamb!\" All right in front of us!  My husband and I looked at each other and thought is this really happening?  Horribly disgusting! We didn't order the Coconut Lamb, the other table did.  

On a side note, the Basmati rice was greasy, dull and had lots of clumps, which if made fresh should be light, fluffy but slightly firm and aromatic.  This had the consistency of generic Minute Rice.  

The quality of the meat, lamb and chicken, was mediocre.  The tastiness and spice complexity to the dishes was very bland.  While not a major connoisseurs of Indian cuisine, both my husband and I felt this place was no contestant in comparison to other establishments we've enjoyed on the west coast.  Even if the dinner was uneventful, $51 is steep for the portions and quality.

While we did take what we didn't eat home, we did toss it after questioning the restaurant's hygiene practices.  We didn't complain and make a spectacle, as this isn't our style, but we will not come back again."}
{"text":"As if they needed another 5 star review. This place is delish. Yes, it can be crowded, but can you blame everyone for wanting to eat at what is the best-tasting Indian restaurant in the burgh?

Buffet - plenty of vegetarian (and vegan, and gluten-free) options, and all clearly labeled. Honestly, that is so considerate. Everything from the humblest potato on up to the smoked and spiced eggplant is divine. Plenty of things I would have never tried otherwise, and even more pleasant surprises.

If you choose to eat during non-buffer hours, I would actually recommend it. You don't get to try everything, but anything I've ever ordered off the vegetarian menu has been amazing. It's a calmer atmosphere. Perfect for a date. Sure, the lighting is bright, but you can't have everything. Also, they serve the food to you with these little candle warmers (whatever those are called) that keep it hot the whole meal. And I can tell they make their own chutneys because every time I go, they taste a little different. Hint: what was the spiciest last time may not be what is the spiciest the next time, and that's the fun of it!

Finally, their service is often harried by people trying to get their hands on yummy food, but never unfriendly. If you go to the buffet, just embrace the chaos - it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in town. I went for the lunch buffet. They had a huge selection for a weekday buffet. Their food was all so delicious. It wasn't overly spicy. It was very mild and perfect for me. I think my favorite thing there was the goat curry! I definitely suggest trying this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala hot with Naan and it was amazing!!!!!
It's nice restaurant and one thing I did not like was I went on Tuesday and it was closed"}
{"text":"2013 best in Pittsburgh places to eat....not anymore. I knew the moment I walk in, I stood there for about 5 minutes before a young guy came over and acknowledged me. He pointed over to a two seater and told me, \"sit over there.\" The table was dirty. I sat at the table for 10 minutes until I had to wave down a server to take my order. Once my order was placed I was given crackers. After taking the first bite I realized little human hairs baked into the crackers. When I pointed out to the waiter that there were hairs in the crackers he proceeded to do his own investigation of the hairs at my table. No apologies. I should of left. It was late I was tired and hungry. The water was tap, no ice and in a dirty glass. Exactly one hour after I arrived I was still waiting to eat. I couldn't take it. I got up and left. This was a slow Wednesday night. Biggest disappointment. Disgusting place. And lazy people."}
{"text":"The service was good, despite how busy the place was.  We chose to order off the menu instead of ordering the buffet. The shrimp tikka masala was massively overpriced for what you get...$15 for 4 pieces of shrimp...insane. Otherwise, the food was ok."}
{"text":"Best Tika Malsala I've ever had.  So delicious.  Great goat curry as well.  Rice and naan were fine, but nothing special.  Overall, great Indian food."}
{"text":"A long time favorite of mine.  Dinner buffet is delicious and fresh (the word buffet doesn't usually bring these words to mind).  I'd highly recommend the malai kofta, vegetable korma, baingan bhartha, and palak paneer.  Also the gobi and garlic naan."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at about 11:35 ( they opened at 11:30). Two gentlemen inside...asked if the were open and one guy said yes. He then approached us and sat us down. Did the full step by step waiter obvious. We ordered our food and he even suggested appetizers. Waited about 30 mins and he says Sorry to inform you guys but our cook is running late ...we're going to give a free appetizer while you wait cause he will be here shortly...20 mins later we ask if the cook is here he says almost. 50 mins later we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Such amazing food! I haven't had Indian food in a long time and was a little nervous but wow, definitely my new go to. Great service, nice location, and AMAZING FOOD!"}
{"text":"My tikka masala was good but the naan was burnt and didn't taste that great. The lamb rice was not very tasty at all (you would think for $20 dollars for rice it would at least have some flavor). Customer service was good when I could actually get it. They were short staff when we came in but they tried their best. I would definitely try another Indian restaurant before considering to ever go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out twice within last month, it hasn't been ready either time. I've come at the backend of the pick up time window and had to wait in the restaurant 15-20 minutes while they make the food for me on the spot. Food is good however my time is valuable and I'd appreciate if it was ready when they said it would be ready"}
{"text":"One of my first cracks at Indian food; i was pleasantly impressed.  The ratings match up with the quality of food -- definitely worth the try.  I'd go for the buffet so you can try an assortment of foods."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food.   Friendly people.  Best Indian in Arizona.  Spice level adjusted to your taste. Waitress recommended coconut shrimp (thick orange sauce with coconut milk),  it was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD!!!

The owner Gil is seriously a gem!! The food was way better than I expected! My only critique would be that the portions are a little on the small side. The flavor of all the food was beyond satisfying!! 

We will definitely be back to try more delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to explore different types of Indian food at a very reasonable buffet price. The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, and the food tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"The food was good but don't look down at the floor. The carpet is disgusting with garbage all over the place and the utensils and tablecloths with questionable at best.  The bright lighting emphasized the filth. 

I was here with a party and followed the rest of the crowd but if I was here alone, I would have walked out.  The ladies' restroom was surprisingly clean, maybe the staff will let you take your meal in there."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We got the chicken tiki masala and lamb boti Masala. Service was amazing too. The owner is really hospitable. Portions are small but the amount of flavor in every bite makes up for it."}
{"text":"There are times in our life , where we feel like we don't  exist , unfortunately TajMahal succeeded in doing it , everyone around us people after and before us get their drinks and complimentary papad unfortunately we won't why ? So as I write this review I am waiting on my food and I am going to leave after the food arrives and I am going to tell them why I am leaving"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place... the food is terrible. I am from India, can't call this any close to Indian food let alone tasty. We were visiting Scottsdale and craved Indian food and ordered carry out from this restaurant. We ordered Chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, malai kofta, naan and gulab jamun (dessert) Food was BLAND, Indian food is known for its spices, this food had NO spice no flavor. It felt like everything was cooked in heavy cream with no spice and no salt. The gulab jamun was spoilt... if we didn't carry out, I would have returned my entire order. Not to mention, it's very expensive. Only positive is the person who answered the phone and got our order ready was very friendly."}
{"text":"This food was PHENOMENAL. I live in New York, among a plethora of Indian food, and this was by far the best I've ever had. Only open in this location for 6 months, this restaurant has a cozy, family-style atmosphere that makes the food even more enjoyable. The owner, Gil, is extremely amicable and loves to make conversation. He makes you feel right at home! I highly recommend the Chicken Saag and the Bhindi Masala. If you're in town, definitely try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place I have ever eaten. Amazing selection with over 200 items on their menu. Excellent service, excellent tasting food they ask spicy level 0 to 10 which works very nice. It is a clean place and again the best place I have ever eaten will be back every time I am in Pittsburgh and may even drive the 1.5hrs just to eat there a few times."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. However I was less than impressed. I purchased a Groupon because I have tried this place before and was so impressed by it I figured it was a good deal. That was a huge mistake. We came in and it was a Saturday evening and the place was dead. We should have left right then and there but we figured that people were out and about and Old Town. We ordered our food and the three types of Curry looked and tasted the same. The butter chicken, the chicken korma, and the chicken tikka masala had nothing special about any dish to differentiate between them. We ordered the assorted naan and more than half of the basket was burnt. Take a look at the picture for evidence. We did not want to be rude and the waiter was great and the service was wonderful and the owner came by and said hello. However this place in the terms of quality has gone to garbage. I used to swear by this place and now I am embarrassed to have even picked this as a place to eat this evening. There was hardly any spice difference in any of the dishes and for $16.99 I would have assumed that the portion would be slightly larger than what we were given. I do not think that it was even enough food to have fed my 10 pound puppy. Save your money and save yourself the troubles of unauthentic Indian food and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First off, I never write reviews. After eating here though, I felt compelled to write one. I had the lunch buffet and it was incredibly delicious. They offer a large variety of food options, which is great if your interested in trying Indian food, or just love it already. The staff seemed super genuine and nice, the food quality was fresh and full of flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very bad service, food over cooked, cold rice, waited over an hour for dinner. Lamb was very tough, couldn't cut it let alone chew it. Vegetable sizzler, veggies were burnt.  Not recommended...3 thumbs down. Not a good value."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great service. Happy that they opened up this Scottsdale location. Much closer."}
{"text":"Good buffet, horrible service.  Dishes piled up on the table, impossible to get a refill and not very friendly.  It looked like on of the owners was sitting there rolling a mountain of silverware instead of lending a hand!  We couldn't get a check and left  extra (plus tip) just to make sure we paid in full.
Too bad because the food was very good."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Absolutely the best Indian food we've had in Arizona. Chicken Tikka masala was amazing as was the saag paneer and garlic naan. Owner Gil is also extremely friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be regulars here."}
{"text":"I am writing this after receiving a response from Taj Mahal's owner regarding a previous review I posted. The review was not glowing, as I did not have a very good experience, but the owner's reply was so gracious that it became clear how much she cares about both her business and customers. I look forward to returning, and exploring more of Taj Mahal's expansive menu."}
{"text":"I've heard many great reviews about this place and was pleased that it didn't disappoint.  I can only speak the buffet part of the restaurant but it was excellent.  There is a wide variety of foods to choose from, including the classics such as sag paneer and chicken tiki masala.  My favorite aspect of this place really is the ownership and service.  We were greeted but warm and welcoming smiles and were well attended to throughout the meal.  Definitely worth the trip out here!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food so far in AZ. The butter chicken is amazing and my fiancé loves their other entrees. Convenient location. Chicken tikka masala and chicken Vindaloo are also good. It is a little expensive but it is my go to for Indian food in the valley. They will substitute white chicken for dark meat if you request."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet that includes some South Indian items, in addition to the usual North Indian items generally served at Indian restaurants. It also includes salad, appetizers and dessert. A lot of variety, for carnivores and vegetarians alike, also halal. The buffet is available twice weekly, not daily. Give it a try, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"If it's Indian in usa, what better place to try out than this. Food was just the way it should be. Ordered paneer makhani and dal makhani and some garlic naan. It was mouth watering. Can't go back to Pittsburgh and eat at Taj Mahal once again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! I have always ordered takeout but the dinner buffet looks good and there is always a good crowd. Some of the best Indian food I have had."}
{"text":"I hated Indian food until I came here. Now I order the vegetable coconut curry and a side of garlic naan once a week. The owner is always there and takes good care of the customers. Great local restaurant for excellent Indian food."}
{"text":"This is not my first rodeo when it comes to Indian food and I will tell you this, if you don't come here your missing the boat. The owner is the most delightful personality the service is hand and foot and the food is exceptional. The prices are reasonable and the place is immaculate and the atmosphere is modern with a touch of India. Please bring them your business!   Namaste!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Incredible. The best Indian food I've ever had. The flavors were rich and full, and the food that was there was diverse enough to satisfy even a picky palate. I live on the other side of the country but if I ever make it out there again... that's my first stop!"}
{"text":"It has been a struggle finding good Indian food in the Phoenix area but we really enjoyed our meal at Taj Mahal! We went in on Friday night around 6:30 and found the restaurant wasn't busy yet. They offered us a seat wherever we wanted so our group of 3 found a table to our liking.

After looking over the menu, we got the Paneer Masala, Saag Mattar Bharta, & Chicken Tikka Masala along with a garlic naan & plain naan. Everything came out smelling so good, and after only the first bite, we were so impressed with the food.

The Chicken Tikka Masala had a delicious, creamy curry and the chicken was tender & perfectly cooked. I had gotten it with mild spice, which was actually perfect for me! We got the Paneer Masala with medium spice. The dish was very similar to the chicken, equally delicious, only with a little bit more spice. My fiancé decided to get the Saag Mattar Bharta super spicy and it was definitely that! For my mom & me, it was too spicy, but he enjoyed it. The entrees came with a side of rice, but the naan was so warm and fluffy, I'd recommend getting that! I always like getting garlic naan but their plain naan was also good.

Our waitress was available when we needed something, she came by to refill our drinks, and the owner even came by to check in on us. The menu items seemed a bit more expensive than they are at other Indian restaurants, however the taste was worth the cost! I hear they offer a lunch buffet now ... can't wait to return soon!"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal has the BEST Indian food in Pittsburgh, and believe me, I have tried it all.  Besides being partial to this restaurant because it was my first exposure to a lifelong obsession with Indian food and culture, Taj Mahal is just plain delicious.

I am not usually a buffet sort of girl, but I make the exception for the lunch buffet here.  My favorite part of this buffet besides the low low price and the giant selection of delicious food?  The labels on each dish that designate whether or not it is vegetarian!  So helpful and easy.

Eating a sit-down dinner is even better than eating at the buffet.  While the restaurant's decor isn't the most charming, the service is always good and the food always amazing.  Even though I like my food fiery, I appreciate being asked how spicy I want my curry on a 1-to-10 scale, and my mom who hates spice appreciates this even more.  Faves from Taj Mahal- the perfectly puffy naan, the free papadum and chutney, the fresh mango lassis, and the paneer makhni.  Serving the dishes in platters with individual candles below to keep them warm is also a nice touch."}
{"text":"First off, the owner and the staff are amazing. The service is definitely what separates this place and others. Not to mention, usually buffet curries taste watered down, from the two times I have been here for lunch, that was not the case. The curries have pretty strong creamy flavors that you usually can't find at other buffets. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet. More than that quality tasty Indian food. Very clean. There is always nice music playing  in the background. I've tried other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh but this one is the best one in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok, so this review isn't going to be very specific on what I ate. Frankly, I know what it all was but have no idea the names or how to pronounce most of it.

Went here with two friends cause we are all pretty inexperienced with Indian food but were curious. Decided we should go to a buffet to try a variety of things figuring we would at least find something we each liked and could explore several dishes for not a lot of money.

Everything was great! A lot of rice. A lot of chicken. Some goat. A lot of different sauces. All good.

There was some spice and heat to some dishes, but nothing unbearable. Good Naan bread. Like I said, I would just butcher the names, so I won't even try. Just know that for three guys that didn't have much experience with Indian food that we all really enjoyed it.

Dining room was nice and service was pretty good. The place was packed and there were only two servers to clear plates and refill water. We did go during Diwali so that is probably why.

I hope to get back again and explore Indian food some more!"}
{"text":"A delectable buffet spread, with an extravagant range of choices to suit most palates. The food reflects the personal commitment of the owners and the excellent ingredients used. Taj Mahal never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent patron of theirs for over ten years. Buffet night is a must."}
{"text":"An amazing place that my Wife and I found accidently a long time ago. Food is great, and all you can Indian food on Monday, Thursday & Saturday is such a treat and something I've never seen or experienced before.
The staff are amazing and the atmosphere is beautiful."}
{"text":"We live in Indiana and we went there last night. I wouldn't brag myself if I says this is the best Indian food I ever ate in States! Food was very delicious, ambiance was nice and Owner(Mr.Gill) was very friendly and taking care of each table personally!
Overall everything was perfect and on top of that it's located in very happening street! Don't miss this spot if you are in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Have been multiple times for their buffet and everything is quite fresh. Food is authentic and very tasty.  Everything is warm and even the deserts are on point! Servers are friendly. One of my favorite spots for Indian food."}
{"text":"Food wasn't terrible but it was almost flavorless, yet expensive. Indian is supposed to be full of flavor and scents, this was served from a can to your plate."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance, and friendly staff. First place we came when visiting and will be back!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of all different kinds of foods for Vegetarians ! good for trying out new stuff :) Fresh garlic naan and rice - owner is really nice and makes sure your food is excellent, Happy Hour sounds good too :)"}
{"text":"I am a true fan of this restaurant, but my last visit just wounded me, \"WAIT STAFF\" ill informed and rude rude rude, cashier insolent and just rude period, I took a friend here for the buffet which at one time was the best, well let me tell ya it was poorly stocked, and forget asking the service if it was going to be restocked, now I will say the food that was left on the buffet was very good, the offerings this day was skimpy at best, highly unlikely I will return ..."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian Curries served fresh, flavorful and hot for a very reasonable lunch buffet price point.
It has many return customers who know the owners and staff. 
The different flavored warm Naan Breads are brought to the table at least twice while you dine.
All the dishes served here, though on a buffet line at lunch are beautifully executed and tended by staff. The ingredients are colorful and fresh. 
Must go if you are a fan of Indian Cuisine - Taj Mahal will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Cast aside any fear you may have of Indian cuisine and get to this place! The buffet is the freshest, most appetizing array of eastern delicacies you will find in Pgh! 

The service is terrific, the atmosphere calm and pleasant and overall very clean! 

I love this food so much, I now crave it!! 

Wish I lived closer, they would know me by name."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal is my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is spectacular! I've never had anything here that I didn't like. I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Better yet, come here during buffet hours for a chance to sample many dishes. Their website lists their buffet hours and prices. 

If you choose not to go the buffet route, I recommend one of their Special Combination Thali Platters, which also offer a variety for you to sample. During my last visit, I ordered the vegetarian platter and it was delicious. My husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it ranks as his favorite! 

I honestly can go here again and again. Only problem is the restaurant is in the north hills and I live in the south hills!"}
{"text":"Heard that Asian/Indian food suppliers are selling raw food made of plastic. Really scared of the news. I am not going to take any chance . Never know if Business is doing to make more money at cost of compromising on quality.... for me .. Indian /Chinese/Japanese/Thai cuisine is no more my favorite .... cant eat plastic ... I love Taj Food as compared to any other Indian Restaurant ,, but if they are serving plastic ,,, No way I will ever go to any Asian Restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband loves Indian food. Me....not so much. :) For years I sucked it up and went to Indian restaurants with him. Every year on his birthday, we try a new Indian restaurant and this year was Taj Mahal. I assumed I would have my usual basmati rice and naan bread. I was absolutely blown away.....the food was AMAZING! I also hate onions, despise them actually. We ordered the onion rings & I loved them! They were shredded or something so the consistency & flavor was so yummy! The service was phenomenal as well! Hector was so awesome & you can really tell how passionate he is about the food & business. We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"A buddy and I were in Scottsdale for a few days playing golf and came across the Taj Mahal on Yelp.  We ordered the Tandoori mixed grill and the Curry Chicken.  The food was terrific and the atmosphere nice.  Would absolutely recommend and return anytime we're it town!"}
{"text":"The Taj Mahal is a fantastic restaurant, great tasting food,  excellent quality and phenomenal service!!! This is the best Indian restaurant I have experienced. Gill is a wonderful person and a fantastic owner. Bravo Gill 

Bob from New Jersey"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal has excellent food!  My husband and I love Indian food and have been looking for a restaurant in the Phoenix area!  Taj Mahal is by far the best in the valley!  Freddie, the server, was friendly and professional and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Forth time at this great little casual Indian restaurant!  The food was awesome, atmosphere comfortable and service was warm and friendly! Have never been disappointed.  My husband is gluten free.  Previously they had no GF beer on hand.  Tonight, however, they were prepared for us!  The wine selection is ok, but the meals are always outstanding!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with our 10 month old son for the weekend buffet. We were seated fairly quickly at the front of the restaurant. The buffet was delicious and adequate amounts of food were available.

The layout of the restaurant is cramped. If you are seated at the front of the restaurant like we were, you will be within two feet of anyone else trying to be seated. With large parties, this quickly becomes an exercise in how to avoid looking like a fool while scarfing down all of the Taj's delicious food. The cramped feeling is also felt due to the lack of spacing between tables. This is presumably to increase the seating count, but really, I think the experience could be improved by eliminating two tables.

Getting to the buffet from any table is tricky, again due to the cramped layout of the tables. The entry and exit point from the buffet line is at the same spot, and navigating with both a full plate and a child is not really possible unless you are a professional juggler.

Finally, service is average to sub-par. Our water glasses were refilled once. Perhaps this is to encourage a quick meal, but when eating such spicy food, better service should be rendered. I assume there would be a better experience during non-peak times.

All that being said, the food is the best Indian cuisine in the North Hills, and reasonably priced to boot. I would come here again, but not with my kid."}
{"text":"The worst example of Indian food, ever. We ordered the Chicken Tikka masala (their specialty), aloo gobi, and tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken was flavorless and the meat hard, the accompanying onions soggy. The chicken tikka masala got all it's taste from the cream and the aloo gobi was a soggy letdown, flavorless and miserable! In short, a disastrous experience and a traversety of Indian food."}
{"text":"We love this place for Indian! The butter chicken is our favorite coupled with an order of garlic or plain naan. This is a good place if you want an extended dinner. They don't rush you out the door so you can enjoy the company your with."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time and had the chicken tikka masala and Chana sag. Both were excellent. The garlic naan was great too."}
{"text":"Excellent service! From the moment I walked in I was greeted by the young man with a very pleasant smile. My drink order was taken immediately & thank goodness because it's a warm day out! I had the lunch platter which was perfect since it's a sample of different entrees. The chicken tikka masala is seasoned perfectly. Their naan bread is my favorite with the mango chutney."}
{"text":"After hearing all the good reviews about this place from friends and fellow yelpers, I had to try for myself. I came in with high expectations, and walked out with great satisfaction! This must be the BEST Indian buffet I had in Pittsburgh so far!

The atmosphere is very dynamic, bright, clean and family friendly. I came here for the $12 dinner buffet. There were so many choices to choose from and each dish was cooked to perfection--fresh ingredients and quick refills. I wanted to try a little bit of everything, but my stomach surrendered too soon. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have samosa though. 

Overall, I highly recommend Taj Mahal to those with a passion for Indian cuisines and a huge appetite. Dinner buffets are only available Monday, Thursday and Saturday. I will definitely return here again in the near future to finish up some unfinished business (the other half of the buffet I didn't get to try)."}
{"text":"We will definitely be eating here again! This review is for a take out order placed over the phone. 
Have to admit that when we began looking at the take out containers... we were a bit underwhelmed. They didn't look like very big portions. This was our first time trying this restaurant and the concern was that we were not getting our money's worth. Also one of our containers was only a little over half way full. We called the restaurant back to tell them about our concerns and the owner could not have been more gracious in hearing us out. He made sure that we received everything in our order, explained that each container was 16 oz., and then immediately offered to replace the container of chicken tika masala that was only a little over half way full. The owner delivered our chicken tika masala himself! And even brought an extra order of naan. 
As it turns out that the containers were actually really misleading. They appeared to be very small, but in reality contained a decent sized portion.  And truth is... the food is delicious!!! Worth every penny!  
So to the owner of this restaurant (I'm so sorry that I didn't catch your name) Thanks so much for going the extra mile to make your customers happy! 
I know I've been mostly talking about the customer service received, but the quality of the food here is also excellent! Everything was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for some good cuisine!"}
{"text":"Adding to my previous review which lauds the buffet for it's large variety and being offered as dinner buffet three times a week, ordering off of the menu is also good. Been eating here for 3 years and it appears that the food has recently gotten better. I don't know if they have a new chef but dishes seem to have a little bit more flavor.

One star deduction because when I ask for spicy it's never spicy. When I ask for 10/10 it's like a 3/10. I've tried everything from asking for 25/10 (I get funny looks) to having my Indian wife order my dish and I ( I'm a white person) order hers. This is because her dish at 8/10 is nearly always spicier than my dish at 10/10.  In their defense 3/4 of all Indian restaurants I've eaten at in my life seem afraid to really give you a wildly spicy dish when requested. Tamarind will not. Billu's Indian food truck is the best bet. You ask for spicy he promises that it will kick your ass in his words"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved here from Minneapolis. We were very sad to leave our constant go-to for Indian there (it's called Gandhi Mahal if you ever venture up to Minneapolis), and our expectations were very high moving down here. After trying a few places around the Tempe/Scottsdale/Paradise Valley and feeling pretty disappointed, I think we've finally found our go-to here at Taj Mahal.

We ordered take-out and got the chicken tikka masala, lamb boti masala, and a large rice. I was pretty surprised that the rice was extra, but figured the entrees wouldn't let us down, and they sure didn't. Both dishes were deliciously rich and creamy without being heavy. The flavor was incredible! The portions aren't huge, but we had plenty leftover for lunch the next day which was still outstandingly delicious.

While waiting for my order to be ready, I chatted with the owner who has a big personality and clearly knows how to treat customers right. He kindly threw in a complimentary naan bread and hot sauce on the side just for waiting a few extra minutes.

I do wish I could give 4.5 stars only because the naan was a little dry (maybe from it being take-out?) and the lamb was a little tough, but the flavor and customer service experience were both outstanding. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food.  The naan was made just right, and the food comes in these little platters where a candle keeps the food warm.  Nice touch!

All the usual staples, and all are done well.  Friendly service.  I came here before going on a short shopping spree at Ross Park mall - very well placed for that sort of thing!

BTW - I didn't do the buffet.  My sense is that buffets are never as good as fresh food, so I don't go for that and can't vouch for the buffet food."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon, with a good appetite but had no idea that it closed from 2:30-5:00pm.  Nobody told us this when we came in but we ordered and when the food came our waiter told us that the kitchen was closing and if we wanted anything else we would have to tell him then.  Then a gentleman came over to find out if the food was to our liking and had the right amount of spice.  They were very accommodating. He told us that if we wanted more Nan or rice we just had to ask the waiter who stayed to help us.  The food was absolutely the best I've had here in the valley.  Very fresh and the flavor was great.  I would recommend Taj Mahal great food and service.  And the people were very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. There aren't a lot of spices it needs to have more flavor. Me and my girlfriend grabbed take out last night. The daal was ok, there are to many big pieces of onion and green peppers in there. The daal wasn't so cooked I was eating some of the daal that wasn't boiled perfectly. The paneer is just like so much cream and not a lot of flavor. It needs more flavor and spice. I would maybe try it again but for now I'm going to have to explore other place. The garlic naan wasn't that cooked either, and they were undercooked pieces in there without garlic on there.  The onions and the chilies were not fresh. The onions were defiantly really old also like the chilies. I don't know if I would go back unless the  food changes. It is a pricy place to eat also, 15 dollars an entree that is kinda on the high side."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this Indian food and the food is clearly overpriced for dinner, but the sting was taken out of our meal with a 2-for-1 deal. The entrees all average about $18, but should cost five or six bucks less. The staff and owner are nice, but the food was very average. We both had curry and they put the extra spice in my food rather than than my dining companion's food. Both the dishes are normally made with dark meat, but they gave us chicken breast as requested. One of the chicken pieces in my meal was too fatty to eat and some pieces were luke warm as well. The coconut curry was better than the Vindaloo, but all dishes were just unsatisfying. I don't think Americans can ever have a great Indian meal because it's just not a food we grow up eating. 
  The best part of the meal was the garlic naan at four bucks."}
{"text":"Fantastic new spot in South Scottsdale. Yelp did not disappoint yet again with this find. Went there with a couple of friends tonight and ordered everything family style. Everything we got was amazing! 

Garlic Naan
Lamb Saab
Ginger chicken kabobs
Chicken Bhuna
Side of briyanis

...I really don't think you could go wrong here. All of the dishes we had were seriously delicious. The lamb saab was my favorite, though. 
And not only was the food great, but the service was on point. The owner came and talked to us for a bit. Apparently he has a successful restaurant in Prescott and decided to open this place up in Scottsdale about 4 months ago. He was so sweet and funny, and he gave really great recommendations and explanations. Best of all, he gave us coupons for our next visit, which will definitely be happening soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon but it is Diwali and it looked like perhaps they had a family group in a banquet room off the main room.  I was by myself and was seating at a rather awkward table right by the door which was fine because it was just me but it the other chair had been used, the door would have been bumping us constantly.

The buffet was really well stocked with more veg dishes than non-veg.  The naan was phenomenal, probably some of the best I've had outside India.  The only dish I didn't care for was the palak panner, usually one of my favorites but it had very little cheese and what was there was quite tough as if it had cooked too long when it was made.  The mattar paneer on the other hand was very good so not sure what happened to the other dish.  Everything was refilled at least once while I was there except for the goat curry which was pretty must a tray of bones so didn't get to try it.  

Will definitely be back the next time I am in the area for my monthly Trader Joe's run from Youngstown."}
{"text":"I had never had Indian cuisine and I searched through yelp to find the best buffet for my needs to try a good variety of foods.  Taj Mahal met the mark and had a great selection of dishes in a nice atmosphere.  The owner was very nice and met us at the door to arrange for our party of six and our waiter was very polite and quick with our drinks.  We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty packed.

The only downside to the experience was the small size of the dining area and buffet tables.  It was very cramped and navigating around all the patrons at the buffet was annoying.  I wish they had more space, I was constantly saying \"excuse me\" as I bumped into others.  Overall, and excellent buffet at a decent price-I'll return again, maybe for lunch when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre- food took more than an hour with our appetizers coming 30 mins later. It was strange, and when we finally got our food, it was bland and totally not worth the wait. 

If the food was worth the wait, we would have given this place another star.

Maybe they are working out some kinks from being new. Hopefully things will get better. I would try them one more time in the hope that this was a one time fluke. If not, I would add them to my Indian restaurant reject list.

Wishing them the best."}
{"text":"A friend of mine really wanted to get dinner at Taj Mahal for her birthday recently, so this South Hills girl made the trek to McKnight road and walked in hoping for a good meal. Did I get it? For the most part, yes. Could a few things be improved on? Admittedly, yes.

Here's why I say this. I LOVED the food here. Absolutely loved it, adored it, and happily devoured it. The samosas, my appetizer, were quite yummy and had the right mix of crunchy outside with well seasoned (but not overly mushy) potatoes and peas inside. For my main course I ordered the Malai Kofta, which consisted of tasty veggie balls in a creamy cheesy sauce. I actually wish I knew exactly what ingredients they put into the veggie balls, because they were REALLY good. This simple and super savory dish just melted in my mouth as I chewed it and the flavors of the vegetables with the creamy cheese and sauce blended perfectly, as good Indian food tends to do.

Really, the only area I really thought Taj Mahal could improve in is its service, and I kind of wonder of that's because of a cultural difference more than anything. I say this because our waiter (who may have been a manager, it was hard to tell) honestly came across as a little pushy when I was ordering. I had been curious if it would be possible to add meat to the dish I ordered, which was vegetarian. I really, really did want that particular dish (and am so glad I got it!), so my question was mostly out of curiosity - it wasn't a deciding factor or anything. But when I asked, the waiter seemed pretty appalled at my question and began repeatedly suggesting dishes from the meat-based options. They just didn't understand why I'd want to deviate from the main dish and took my question as, \"Oh you want THIS!\" I'm sure they were trying to be helpful, but it really came across as unnecessarily pushy and made me feel as if they weren't listening to me. Not a good thing to feel as a restaurant patron.

Any other problems my friend and I experienced during the night had more to do with the size of the place and its tables than anything. Taj Mahal admittedly goes for more seating, which is nice because more people can come in for dinner at once - but more seating equals smaller tables here. Personally, though, I'm willing to deal with the slightly crowded seating for the another meal here in the future, but their size is definitely something to keep in mind, especially if you're in a larger group.

While some parts of my meal here were more rocky than others, the food was amazing and I didn't find the service to be so terrible that I was overly offended or anything like that. With a few tweaks in their approach I'm sure there would be no problems at all on that front. So I will definitely be back in the future, hopefully to explore their buffet and sample even more of the delicious food they offer here."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! ...definitely good for fish lovers. Try the fish masala and fish pakora for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food in the valley, definitely come check it out.  The location is perfect and the atmosphere is fantastic, would be great for a large party.  The food was absolutely delicious.  We had the Chicken Tika Masala, the Lamb Vindaloo, and the Garlic Naan -- all so tasty I'm still dreaming about them.  The service is also phenomenal, the owner even came out and talked to us, and offered recommendations for some Indian beers to try which were also really good."}
{"text":"Come on a Monday, Thursday or Saturday and get the buffet for $13.95.   It's amazing.  TONS of vegetarian items.  Actually, most of the items are vegetarian.   We've been here for regular dinners as well and they are definitely some of the best in the city. I can't really think of Indian food that I crave in Pittsburgh as much as this place."}
{"text":"My take: Taj Mahal's flavors followed by a cold IPA is a little taste of heaven on earth. Best Indian food in the Valley, in my opinion.

Taj Mahal is the Indian restaurant we'd been looking for. Others have either lacked the rich flavors or have weird quirks about them -- such as refusing to alter any items on the menu. Taj Mahal is the exact opposite -- delicious and accommodating!

If you want the best experience, leave the menus on the table and ask the owner what he recommends based on your preferences and tastes.  You like chicken? Spicy? He has the dish for you. You like lamb? A little more on the mild side? He has you covered. He has never steered us wrong.

The owner is not only knowledgeable, but also extremely friendly.  If things are slow, he may even pull up a chair and chat you up for a bit.  For us, that's part of the experience at Taj Mahal.

The food is the number one reason for my 5-star rating, but Taj is also at the top of my list due to their beer selections. While I don't drink much, Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is a definite favorite and it goes GREAT with Indian food."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food I have ever had !!! What impressed me was the quality of the food. There are No short cuts here! So you do pay a bit more, but the quality is evident. The sauces were excellent as were the taste of the chicken and the lamb !!! They ask you how spicy you would like and they were spot on !! They also had serrano pepper naan!! I have never seen this naan any where and probably one of the naan I have ever had !! Service was excellent too !!! When in town again I will always come back!!! Did take some left overs and heated them the next day, just as good !!! A true sign of the quality of the food !!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! We found this restaurant in the PHX Where Eat magazine. Best Indian food I have had in Arizona. Gil, the owner makes all the food and was very involved in our dining experience.  We will definitely be back!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"first time here...had buffet....absolutely delish.....service was great.......deff going back.....sooooo recommend"}
{"text":"Best Tiki Masala ever, hands-down!  Decor is nice and modern and the waitstaff were friendly and efficient. 
We dined on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy at all.
One of us had the fish curry and one had the tiki masala (medium spicy) and while both dishes were delicious, the tiki blew our minds.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"I hadn't tried the Taj Mahal in quite some time - long before their renovations several years ago. We dined here last week on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty packed.  Had a hard time finding a parking spot to be honest.  We were seated quickly and bellied up to the buffet.  Our price was $14 and it was well worth it. 

There was a terrific variety of dishes to try including goat, chicken, and vegetarian options.  Tikka Masala, palak paneer, naan, samosas, tandoori chicken, chicken biryani, basmati rice and many curry options tested my plate capacity.  The food was tasty and mildly spiced.  

If you like your spice level at 5 or spicier, you might want to order directly from the menu.  Many diners around us ordered family style and the sizzling pans filled with curries tickled our taste buds.  Back the buffet for round two.  

Second plate was filled with sweet treats like those gulab jamon (milk puffs in honey sauce) and kheer pudding.  Fantastic way to finish the meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Taj Mahal several times and I've rarely been disappointed. That being said, today I was a tad disappointed. My wife had the buffet and I had had the puréed eggplant curry (Baingan Bharatha). I'd asked for a spice level of I/10. But what I got was felt a 5/10 to my palate. Another quibble--my wife found the Tandoori chicken from the buffet overcooked & dry. That apart, the rest of the cuisine was excellent as usual. Which is why they get 4/5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"The food was so crazy delicious I'm pretty sure my eyes rolled into the back of my head about 10xs!!! The owner is so pleasant and friendly, we felt like old friends and utterly welcome! The garlic naan melts in your mouth and scoops up saag and veg coconut curry like a boss! Can't wait to visit here again soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. We originally went to try their lunch buffet. Unfortunately for us, the buffet was suspended until the fall. But we stayed and tried the chicken Marsala and Bhuna. 

The service was fantastic. The decor subdued yet tasteful. And of course, the food was fresh and delicious. Sometimes, when you go to a restaurant in a touristy area, the food would be less authentic and drier. But to our wonderful surprise it was delicious. 

In context, my husband and I have tried our shares of Indian food from London to Boston to the Berkshires. So, we can honestly say Taj of Scottsdale is one of the best."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff who gave perfect recommendations. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to visit Scottsdale I have to stop at this restaurant for my Indian food fix. My regular order is the veggie samosas and 2 dishes from their vegan menu. The food and customer service has been amazing and that's the reason they have a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Please avoid this restaurant at all cost. These guys are a big ripoff. The food is mediocre at best and its super expensive but the people are horrible. When we went in we wanted to order one entree but the waiter told us that we wont be served until we order two entrees which was extremely weird. But it didn't stop there. At the time of payment, the waiter stood on top of me and told me that by law everyone needs to pay 15% tip. When I inquired more he started beating about the bush but still kept on intimidating. Please save your self a trip AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly and funny! I had the butter chicken and it was super delicious. The mango lassi was rich and not too sweet. Definitely would go there again :)"}
{"text":"BEST Indian food I have ever had, hands down. Great service--really friendly and attentive. Seriously, go. It is a religious experience. You won't want to eat anything else ever again."}
{"text":"If you like Indian food, this is a must go in the Pittsburgh area, buffet is always great, and the owners are awesome!!! My sister flys in from Phoenix she has to come here every trip. When Taj Mahal was under construction and was only doing take out we went and the owners recognized my sister, set up 2 tables, and prepared a feast! There is no other Indian restaurant that comes close."}
{"text":"This place serves what I consider the be the best Indian dish I've ever had: an amazing lamb boti masala - lamb tikka pieces cooked in a creamy sauce of garlic, tomatoes, ginger, and onions. What an incredible dish, so tasty I would have licked the bowl clean if I were not in polite company. The fragrant basmati rice was a perfect complement and the garlic-cilantro naan I ordered as a side made a delicious vehicle for scooping up every bit of the boti masala sauce. Before the actual meal, I ordered what they call a Taj-mopllitan, an excellent mango based martini.  Service was very friendly and ... very lively - I'm certain my dining companions will agree with me here. The restaurant is a bit of a drive for me but I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit(s) there!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars like others but my experience wasn't like what I expected 
I appreciate that the manager didn't want me to pay after telling him that my order wasn't that good, but at least I don't like leaving without paying anything.
Thanks for the good hospitality I wish this place the best and becoming better for next time I will recommend it to others maybe they will have better experience than me but not with the Chicken Masala that I had. 
I've been trying a lot of Indian restaurants and I know that each Indian chef has his own taste from his own city, but what I would do to improve in small details such as drinks; my juice was a full cup with half ice, the rice that I ordered was not enough (like two spoons only!) and cold too, the chicken wasn't cooked enough.
If I was living in Arizona I would come again and give him another chance because this place looks good and clean and just need to fix these few things,
Thanks anyways and sorry for this disappointed taste."}
{"text":"First off I have been coming here for years and feel terrible that this is my first review, if you ask anyone in my family they would prob say this is my favorite restaurant in Pgh. So I have been here for the buffet and ordered off the menu. The buffet is good to try new things and get a variety and the spice level is just right for all to enjoy. I do prefer a little more spice so I enjoy ordering form the menu which has never let me down. There menu is big but like I said I have always enjoyed all of the dishes I have tried. The Non-Vegetarian Thali and Vegetarian Thali are a good menu option if you want to try a variety of items. My husband loves their Lamb Vindaloo and I have had a few shrimp and fish dishes that were delish! If they have mango pudding on the buffet give it a try, actually if your there for the buffet give everything a little try you might just find a new favorite dish."}
{"text":"We went in on a very slow night - there was only one other table of people. From start to finish this was not a good experience. I am super perplexed by the good reviews. The food was fine - average but with higher prices due to the location. It was the absolutely terrible service that stood out. The staff was nice, but the wait was ridiculous. We were there for about an hour and a half and most of the time we were just waiting. Waiting for drinks (tea), waiting for food that was frequently lukewarm, waiting for naan, waiting for the bill, waiting to get our credit card back... You get the picture. It was painful. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but I wish I could say the same for the service. I went here twice and both times I did not feel appreciated. I felt like the staff would say anything to get me in the door only to badger me later. For instance, I didn't have any cash on me and asked if they take debit or credit. They quickly nodded and seated me without hesitation. When my meal was finished they failed to inform me that not only did they not take debit but there was a minimum for their credit card purchases, awkward. 
I had the vegetable korma the first time which was actually quite tasty but when I came back for lunch their vegetable curry wasn't anything special. It seemed like more an afterthought then a dish that could stand alone."}
{"text":"It's good in general, but I especially enjoy the all-you-can-eat buffet that they do on Monday's and Thursday's in the evening.  I wish they did it more often.  There's so many great dishes to choose from, and the deserts are great too.  I really enjoy the honey treats and the mango pudding the most."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I'm not usually a fan on buffet style, but I make an exception for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the downtown Scottsdale area and have been looking for a good Indian restaurant.  We found a gem last night within 10 minutes walking distance from our condo.  It was awesome!  We had saag paneer, aloo mater and garlic naan....exceptional!  We really loved the decor and service.  A very positive night out on the town.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here on a date a few weeks ago. The date was a dud but the food was good. I would return here if I found myself in the Old Town area. Nice ambiance and good location. I was surprised how dead it was on a Saturday night. I ordered the Saag Paneer and it was great."}
{"text":"Go. 
Just go. 
The buffet is great and getting it to go is insane. I felt like I was cheating them. 

I cannot recommend this place enough. Best Indian food (by far) I've found in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped in Dec 28,and ordered dinner. Asked for a5 in spicyness. Food came and was way over 5 (more like an 8). The manager came by and asked if there was a problem. We explained about the extreme heat, and she immediately took all the dishes back and replaced them with new food that was much milder and edible. Great service. Have stopped in many times before and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Three is generous   Came early food took forever and once he it got here it was average.

The would not come back"}
{"text":"Place was deserted at 8:00 on a Wed night. This made us nervous that the food might not be great, but we trusted in our fellow Yelpers, and we were not disappointed. 

Food tasted hot and fresh. Butter chicken, veg korma, saag paneer, chicken coconut, lentil soup, garlic naan--all were delish. 

The ambience was a bit odd. Loud Bollywood music videos playing, loud buzzing appliance, no music. But the staff were really attentive and friendly. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with a previous reviewer: wish I could give separate ratings for the service and food. First of all the good: the food is outstanding! Fresh and flavorful. The korma was one of the best I've ever had. The Baingan Bhartha was delicious as well. Unfortunately the service was not up to par. I believe our server was a manger. He talked on his cellphone while he seated us, didn't refill our water at any time, and tried to convince my partner to order something different than what he wanted. Very odd. But, we love the food so we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I need to preface this review by stating that I am not experienced in Indian cuisine, having eaten at one Indian restaurant in my life, as a child in Toronto. So this was something pretty new to me, which is surprising since we consider ourselves foodies and enjoy many foreign tastes. Admittedly, I didn't have any legit reasons for staying away from Indian food,and my wife finally got me to take her out for some. 
We tried Taj Mahal because we got a coupon in the mail - goes to show how a little marketing can go a long way. Our other choice would have been Tandoori Times, which we saw featured on \"Check Please\", but the coupon ended up being the deciding factor. 
We chose to try the lunch buffet. Our understanding is that when they opened a year ago, they pulled they buffet because it was so slow in the summer, but now it is back. 
We showed up at 1pm and were the only guests there, which made me a little nervous. The buffet was tucked away in a side room, with not the greatest presentation. It wasn't very inviting. Those worries were quickly assuaged by the food itself! My biggest gripe ended up being that the plates stacked for the buffet were not all clean - some still had food crusted on it. I had to go through the stack to pick out the cleanest plate. If I was the manager there, I would put a little more focus on \"dressing up\" the buffet, just for the sake of visual appeal, make it more inviting. And always have clean plates lol. 
I started with some rice and then sampled every offering in the buffet - there was a variety featuring crispy fried veggie balls, spinach paneer, tikka masala, curry chicken, lamb vindaloo, lentils, tandoori chicken, and a few others. 
Plain and garlic Naan were brought to our table, separate from the buffet.
All the food was excellent! The meat was tender, and the sauces were delicious. I went back 2 more times to help myself to a few of the items I really enjoyed (which was almost all of them lol). In particular, the lamb vindaloo stood out - it was so savoury and tender.
For me the weakest link in the buffet was the tandoor chicken - the chicken legs themselves were not that great, too fatty and mushy. But everything else was really fantastic!  Consider me sold on Indian food, I am ready to try more after eating at Taj Mahal. 
The service was also top notch - you can immediately tell this is family run. The owner came to our table to chat, and was very engaging and very proud of his restaurant. I imagine he visits every table and chats with all the guests, that just seemed to be the overall vibe. Other people trickled in as we dined, and some were already on a first-name basis with the staff. Always a good sign! By the time we left, the business had picked up a bit - I guess we showed up during a dead time of 30 mins or so, so in retrospect was not an issue. 
I took a peek at the menu before leaving, and it was pretty large, featuring all the meats, fish, shrimp etc cooked in every style possible. My wife confirmed that it was a pretty extensive Indian menu, she couldn't think of anything missing. The owner assured us that any dish can be ordered at any level of spiciness, accommodating all sorts of taste parameters. The buffet was noticeably toned down, which made sense, and to be honest was PERFECT for me - I didn't want anything too spicy or overly pungent. While it didn't challenge me, the buffet more than made up for that by being very homey and comforting. 
And that's the big takeaway from Taj Mahal.... I found this Indian food experience to be COMFORTING above all else. It seems more like eating at an Indian grandmother's kitchen, than a fancy restaurant that tries to \"elevate\" common dishes. Seems like they stick to the basics, without getting fancy, and do a fantastic job. For an Old Town Scottsdale establishment, it was not pretentious or arrogant - it was comforting and confident. 
While expanding my Indian food experience probably means trying other places, we definitely intend on returning to Taj Mahal to try their full menu after having enjoyed the buffet."}
{"text":"Dahi vada, gulab jamun, and kheer are killer. If you go for the buffet branch out a little and try their offerings other than standard chicken tikka masala/palak paneer...while those are both very good, it's worth your while to try things like the kadhi pakoda (a Punjabi curry consisting of chickpea dumplings in yogurt) and the chili chicken (an Indo-Chinese dish with chicken in a fiery sauce), as well as goat curry. Goat isn't scary--it tastes a lot like lamb, though a tad bonier. Sometimes they have idli and hakka noodles too--worth a try! I do not like their tandoori chicken at all--always too dry for me!

Service is a little brusque but I'm okay with that. They show music videos from Bollywood movies at least during lunch (haven't been for dinner since before their extensive renovation), which is a lot of fun. They also do an extensive catering business and have an attached banquet hall where I always see people having engagement parties. They also provided lunch for the Indian delegation to the G8, which should say something about Taj Mahal's place in the Indian food community in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good service. Naan was so-so. Chicken tikka masala was great. They really make it hot when asked for extra spice, without destroying the flavor."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Indian food anywhere. Best buffet in Pittsburgh with tons of options for vegetarians and carnivores alike. Drinks are pricey and it's sometimes hard to get ice, but the food makes it well worth it. Newly remodeled and free wifi, also."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty packed. The Indian food was okay. I've been to other restaurants with more options, particularly for vegetable, appetizers, and dessert dishes. The spices and flavours are not as strong as what I'm used too. I agree with others that this is definitely \"American Indian\" food rather than authentic, and I absolutely love authentic Indian food. This place does have a lot of meat options though. The restaurant gets really busy so make reservations."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet place with lots of options. There was plenty of vegetarian and some vegan dishes as well as the usual meat dishes like chicken marsala and tandori chicken. Everything very delicious.

I'm normally not a big fan of Indian cuisine so I can't tell you whether its authentic or not but who cares; the food was good! Food wasn't too spicy but had nice heat.

The owner lady was a real sweetheart. She made sure we were well taken care of there. There's very few places to get ethnic foods in Pittsburgh and this place is a gem."}
{"text":"The lunch special here is great! Lots of choices for vegetarians as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've recently discovered my love for Indian food and I am on a mission to try all the Indian restaurants in the area. This one is down the street from where I live so it was next on my list. 

First off the service was absolutely amazing. The gentleman there pulled out my chair for me when he stated us, was very attentive, and all around did an amazing job. 

The menu is huge! Seriously so many options for each course! We started out with the vegetarian fried sampler. This had a good mix of options but I was most excited to try the fried cottage cheese. It seems super weird but it was actually pretty good! It's an odd texture but I would get it again. 

I had been craving chicken tikka masala ever since I first had it, so I had to try it here for my main course. The food came out in about 20 minutes in these cool boat things that had a candle under the plate with the food in it so it kept it warm. I loved that, never seen it before so I thought it was an awesome touch! My food was super creamy and flavorful. I had the spice at a level 6 and it was just enough spice. I would order this again in a heartbeat! 

I love that this is super close to me and on my way home. I am sure I will order from here again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"One of my
Favs in Indian for pick up.

Eating there sometimes is less pleasant because they have one waiter who acts like serving us is the end of the world and it's really unappreciated but other then that I love the food.

They forgot to add on a butter chicken to our bill so it end up being higher which was uncalled for, they repeated the order and then changed us once we arrived. It's not cheap but two eat good for 2 it's about 50-60. Still so yummy and worth every bite."}
{"text":"Very nice food. Quality if food is extraordinary. The price was worth and there are many options to try from. Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Post graduation ceremony of my little sister, decided to eat somewhere nearby, also 4 tummies were asking for Indian food. Checked in Taj Mahal. It took a while to be seated. We were four people. The restaurant is half filled and there is only one person working. We ordered food, and the lady was under the assumption that we are all sharing our food, so she doesn't ask what my mom wants. Finally, she gets the order right. 30 minutes later our food arrive. I told her that I didn't order rice, but she keeps persisting that I have to eat with my matar paneer and dal tadka. I said no, and she keeps insisting and doesn't let me finish talking. Then finally she asks how would I eat my curries, I said paratha, I ordered paratha...Then she says, oh yeah; she doesn't even apologize. Super bad service! My matar paneer was tasteless, and my puri was overcooked. My mom's shrimp biryani was dry, my father's tandoori platter was salty and my sister's vegetable curry with paratha was under cooked. Bad food! Save yourself from the waiting of the wrong and impolite service. I feel bad for the ingredients that was in the food because they were not well utilized."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Indian food. However, this place was actually really good! The buffet had a ton of choices. Tons of vegetarian options. Everything was fresh and really tasty! My only complaint is that they never refilled our drinks."}
{"text":"Up on McUgly Road not far from the mall is some very good Indian food and what is arguably the largest Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. I was very happy the first time I went here, and overate, which is just too easy to do. I have only been here for the lunch buffet, as I don't live close by and it's not convenient for me to, say, stop by for dinner some evening. I would have given The Taj 5 stars, but for my one complaint, which is that the food is high in fat and very rich, even for Indian food. Of course, this is what makes it taste so good, but at times they go too far. Other than that, the food is well prepared with obvious talent and care, and I do crave it between visits."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal can instantly turn anyone from average Joe into thinking they are a Bollywood star being catered to. As such, I was ready to jump into a synchronized song and dance rendition with the overuse of pastels when I left- except that my stomach was so full I would have the grace of, say, Kristy Ally.

Simply put, this is a busy indian buffet the majority of the time. Lunch is cheaper than dinner and is quite a bargain. Basmati is always perfectly cooked, and samosas are hot and delectable. To say the spread is filling and wonderful is an understatement. Seriously, my eyes looked like someone who just got done buying tons of cat food at Wal Mart and just stepped into an Old Country Buffet, when I view this selection.

From Tikka Masala, to Korma, Goat and Chicken Curries, you will attempt to construct the leaning tower of Pisa on your plate, and wish there was some way you could get to all the different selections in one sitting."}
{"text":"Wow...what is there not to like about this place?!?  Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and simply amazing food!  We stopped in last night for dinner and had an absolutely great experience.  We shared the chicken pakora (ridiculously juicy and yummy) and I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala with rice, garlic naan and a mango lassi.  The food was flavorful and downright delicious.  I ate way too much, but honestly enjoyed every last bite of it.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was like finding a treasure. We love Indian food and have our favorites in the U.K.  Nothing has come close to what we are used to flavor wise until we ate here.  They've only been open 2 years and I hope they're around forever.  We enjoyed chicken Korma, lamb saag, plain naan bread ( not my favorite) and the best papadoms I've ever had! Expect to over eat because  it's hard to stop."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were from out of town just walking the streets looking for food when we found Taj Mahal. The food here is amazing! The staff is extremely friendly and very personable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is very flavorful and rich with spice! Level 1 hot spice is the perfect level of spiciness for anyone! This establishment is an example of a simple family owned business that delivers quality fresh rich food for very affordable prices! Will be going back again in the future"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. We shared the chicken coconut and lamb masala. Wow!!  So flavorful and absolutely delicious. We are so happy that we finally found an Indian food place that we love. The mango lassi is also great, a must have to soothe the yummy spiciness of the food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Tikka Masala I've ever had.

Gill is a great guy, very friendly.  Can't wait to bring my friends here"}
{"text":"We loved the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan, the food is authentic and not to forget  delicious and yummy. Gill was a wonderful host , would recommend any one visiting Scottsdale and want Indian food should visit here."}
{"text":"We really really loved this place.  Food was fantastic, and great ambiance too.  Glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Good food. Unfortunately, sadly disappointed with the prices. There are places around Phoenix that are equally or more flavorful where one can find money's worth. As an example, if you like Indian vegetarian food, which by the way is the norm in India, get out of your Scottsdale comfort zone and try 'Little India' on baseline and McClintock. Like your mom would cook at a fraction of the price. Overall, this place is not worth the money."}
{"text":"?This was our first experience at The Taj, and it was unique and pleasant?. The restaurant decoration is very welcoming. The service was very efficient and my spicy Marguerita? was right on point. My boyfriend had the vegetable korma? (vegetarian), and I had the vegetable coconut?  (vegan). We both loved our dishes. The waitress? suggested my plate, and she was right. It was delightful, spicy, and creamy. The garlic naan was also excellent! After we had our meal, the owner came to check how everything was and? shared an enjoyable conversation? about his experiences, things to do in the city (we are not locals), and local events. It was for sure great customer service. I would recommend?d this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"The Taj Mahal is definitely a very good restaurant! I cannot asses neither if it is authentic Indian (even though to me at least seems like authentic) or if it is the best Indian in Pittsburgh (since I have not been to that many other Indian restaurants), but I can asses that it is delicious! Most of the times I have visited I have ordered the chicken tikka masala which is absolutely amazing! I also have a hard time to stop eating the paneer naan because it is so delicious! I still have not tried their buffet and I am looking forward to it because this is a way to try more of their stuff! I will be visiting this place many many times in the years to come for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Everything was sweet!! Inconsistent execution...sometimes it's too spicy...today it was so sweet...we literally threw away the food."}
{"text":"Small, friendly restaurant that has fantastic food! If you like Masala this is your place, especially on Mondays where they have Masala Monday buy one dish get one half off. Service is fantastic as well. Garlic naan is amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We decided to try an Indian place in Scottsdale and where pleasantly surprised. The service here was a little long, but when we got the did we understood why. They put love and skill into making the food here. The food here is fresh and aromatic. Our waiter was also really nice.
They've only been here a month and I hope they maintain the quality of their food as they grow their business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were here on a Monday night and we were both very impressed with this restaurant! The space and the exterior are beautiful and it's in a great happening location in Old Town. I've had my fair share of Indian food and this place was one of the best I've had! The food was beyond delicious and the service was great. The owners were so sweet and were talking to us throughout our dinner. Turns out they just opened here in Scottsdale and have another location in Prescott. We will make sure to check them out next time we are in Prescott. Would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the place was empty, which made me wary of the food. But it was amazing! The server was great, he was friendly, he chatted with us. He even gave my friend a half order of a dish when she couldn't decide between two. The chicken tikka masala didn't have much spice but had a really good flavor. It was the same with the butter chicken. The garlic naan was absolutely incredible. I'm for sure coming back!"}
{"text":"My best friend's husband hates Indian food, so when I visit from St. Louis, she's excited because it means she has an exotic dining partner. She found Taj Mahal in the Entertainment Book a year or two ago, so we've now been there several times. We've never actually used the Entertainment Book discount, though, because it's only good on regular menu meals - we usually get the buffet.

There are about 16 main dishes on the buffet, with about six of them vegetarian. Generally, there's a good mix of mild/moderately spicy, creamy/brothy, veg/starchy. During my most recent visit, the variety was a bit off. As a vegetarian, I could only choose between two dishes with bready/mealy balls (kafta?), and there were no red-orange sauces or paneer dishes. Thus, everything on my plate kind of looked and tasted the same, which wasn't awesome. The variety on the meat-lover side looked much better. 

In addition to main dishes, the buffet also had fried doughnut batter rings, a cashew-eggplant thing, a soup and salad. Naan and rice were of course provided, too.

There usually are a couple of desserts available - rice/tapioca and galub jamun. I make a beeline for the galub jamun, as I'm a sucker for anything that tastes like syrup or honey. The dough balls are large, but they're airy enough to let the rose-honey syrup really soak in. Delicious.

The menu is quite extensive. There are two pages of vegetarian entrees alone. Next time, I'll likely eschew the buffet so that I can try specific dishes and take advantage of the buy-one-get-one offer in the Entertainment Book.

Water service is quite slow. I'm almost to the point of asking for two glasses immediately, as I tend to down water and hate eating starchy Indian food without it. I really wish Taj Mahal and other restaurants would just leave a carafe on the table, especially when everyone at the table is drinking water.

The restaurant itself has undergone renovation and expansion since I've been coming. There are several stalls in the restroom now, but the women's restroom smells really, really musty and mildewy."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently during the week, and was surprised to be the only ones there when we walked in. The service was great and the food was excellent! We had the chicken dansak and lamb bhuna. The chicken was nice and tender and lamb perfectly cooked, both dishes tasted great! Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"A great experience.

Taj Mahal sits on McKnight Road in McCandless. The area is strip mall heaven. The place doesn't seem that big from the outside. When I entered with my partner, I was stunned to see the best buffet selection at an Indian restaurant ever. There was pav bhaji, which I've never seen before at an Indian buffet. There was even pani puri (although the pani is not on the same par as to what my Indian 5-star chef of a mother makes at home). And there was even malai kofta (my favorite Punjabi dish), which is rare to find at a lunch buffet. I took two plates and ate myself into a food coma. It was a great time with my partner. Indian food in Morgantown, WV never stood a chance.

Other thing I noticed that was very smart was how they covered the table with thick paper so that you wouldn't worry about spilling and getting the cloth tablespread dirty. The servers were quick with the water and friendly.

As far as to what could be better. The pani puri. But it's like asking Steph Curry why he didn't score 60 points and just 50 points. Great experience, and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Both my daughter and I were in attendance, along with about a dozen friends. 

I was looking forward to trying another place in old town Scottsdale, as it had been quite some time since we have dined in this area. Another bonus was that I would get a chance to catch up with my daughter over dinner. 

I had just arrived from the Airport on a business trip, and she picked me up to take me to this establishment.

Upon arrival, I immediately was greeted by Gil and his wife - the owners of this place. I introduced myself and my daughters, and were promptly seated in our own dining area since we were such a large group.

Unbeknownst to Gil, I had actually dined at their Prescott location a few times. So, their food quality was not unfamiliar to me; and I was hoping for the same experience here in Scottsdale.

Everyone ordered individual dishes to their liking (or experimentation). My daughter ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. I ordered the Tandoori Chicken.

The verdict? Absolutely delightful! 

Both the chicken dishes we had were prepared to perfection both in consistency and taste. Now, the portions were smaller that what I am normally accustomed to, but that did not detract from the quality of the food whatsoever.

The Basmati rice that came with our meal was always quite tasty. It wasn't dry and overcooked as is the normal case from recent experiences in various other Indian Food establishments.

As my daughter and I were leaving, after settling the bill, Gil was so grateful for our visit that he asked if we could stay just 5 extra minutes as he wanted to express his gratitude by making us a special dessert. 

Neither my daughter nor I ever turn down dessert, so we opted to stay. Gil assured us that we would not be disappointed.

And after the short wait, we were presented with such a wonderful treat that we both unequivocally exclaimed that we were glad we stayed!"}
{"text":"My wife and we're on a short visit to Pittsburgh, PA. We visited some friends in the Cranberry township.  After that meeting we searched yelp for an Indian restaurant that was open on Mondays.  We came upon Taj Mahal and decided to check it out, and glad we did.  Though it was an all day buffet deal, the food was actually pretty good for a buffet.  We have eaten at many Indian restaurants, mostly in the SF Bay Area, and the buffets are not usually not very good, as food may not be freshly looked."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Indian food I have had in Arizona. The staff was incredible and the place was decorated beautifully."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, this is by far the WORST service I have experienced dining out and that too from the actual OWNER of the restaurant.  Although the food was quite decent with the exception of the over salty pakoras, our waiter was loud and abnoxious from the minute we got there, took forever to get anything including utensils and water not to mention the food. To top all that off we got our bill handwritten on a piece of paper!!!! Yup you read right!!!! And to top that off we were way over charged!!! Absolutely absurd!!!! If u are even thinking of trying it out walk, no RUN in the opposite direction!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the premium restaurants in Old Montreal area. If you are looking for good Indian food, this is the place you should visit. Ambience, service and food is very good."}
{"text":"Average Food. Loud, Unprofessional & Brash Host

This place is highly rated and that is what drew me  and my friends here on Christmas Day. Here's what happened. This might be hard to believe but its true. I'm not a fan of writing lengthy negative yelp reviews. 
1. Host (heavy set Indian Punjabi guy) comes to take the order, writes all the items. We ordered a range of items from lamb, chicken, biriyani and pulao. Host asks for spice level.. My friend asks host if he is asking for any specific item, Host responds that he's referring to \"everything\" (At this point my friend and rest of us didnt like his tone) and not just one item. So we told him mild.. Till now everything was fine. 

2. During the course of our meal, he came up to our table 3 times asking the exact same questions(trying to make conversation)  a. how the food was(which was fine by us) b. how he is seeing so many people from california today visiting his restaurant 
c. tried to \"settle\" things with my friend that if they were \"good\"
3. On the last two of the three occasions, he jokingly taunted my friend by telling my friend's wife \"she is with this man\". Even tried making a funny comment at his daughter. He jokingly asked us if we had been \"driven out of California that we were at that restaurant \". When we asked for the check he also said we could leave pay a couple of thousand dollars to which my friends wife said that he could give us a complementary meal. Following it he again mocked us. I don't think any sane host ever behaves like this
4. He was rude to his staff (seemed mostly mexican) including yelling at them, talking to them in an undignified tone. He was also talking in a boisterous manner even with other customers trying to please them. Has no sense of customer service or class whatsoever. 
5. During the \"driven out of California\" comment I lost my cool and told him that we werent interested in making conversation with him and needed to get the check. As he walked away he said in a snide manner that \"It was my lucky day that he fed me\". 
6. He yelled at the waiter again asking them to ring us up and gave a paper check with extremely poor handwriting and added a 20%+ tip(87 dollars was inflated to 106). In order to avoid any further altercation, we just paid everything off and left. 
By far the most uncultured unprofessional host i have seen till date. Owner: if you're reading this, please take note and fire him because of the way he behaves with your staff if not anything else. Host: If you happen to be the owner, may god save you and go learn the basics of customer service."}
{"text":"This place was freaking AWESOME! Everything we ordered was delicious and flavorful. If you're vegan and in Scottsdale this place is a must. Friendly service and their recommendations are on point. Will definitely come here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Good quality chicken pieces and they use more potatoes than other Indian buffets use which is the best thing. They also use cauliflower and eggplant a lot and don't skimp out on the vegetables to save money but I still think they use too many onions and should add more potatoes to the dishes with potatoes in them and use more carrots . Awesome desserts. This place needs a lot more seating though. They probably need to  expand.  Staff are polite and calm."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale. Great food and hands down the best location for getting Indian food in the valley. Got a chance to speak to the owner too. Really nice guy and took care of us the whole time. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went there on Sunday February 16th.  For a start the parking lot was plowed as well as could be expected given the winter that we've had.  I arrived at around 8:00 pm and the restaurant was about three-quarters full which is quite amazing for a cold snowy Sunday night.  I was surprised by the number of tables that had four people, usually two couples.  There were also young couples and older couples which told me that the food seems to be enjoyed by all.  This told me that couples like their food enough to bring their couples-friends along.  
I had a lamb vindaloo which was nice and spicy, as requested.  I liked my raita which is the one dish that varies widely from Indian restaurant to restaurant.  My garlic naan was the best that I've had in a long time.  I was very impressed wit the fact that the dishes (food and rice) came in a dish that was heated by a candle.  So when I dished my second helping it was still nice and warm.  The service was good.
All in all, I had a nice meal and from the looks of things so did everyone else that was there.  The bathroom was pretty clean which was another good sign."}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the second time tonight. The first time was because Tamarind is not open on Mondays. Anyway, I had the Goat Vindaloo and Mango Lassi. I ordered the Goat Vindaloo -medium spicy and it was perfect for me meaning, there's a nice kick but my taste buds are still in tack when I leave the place. The Mango Lassi which is a yogurt/milk mixture flavored with mango... I really enjoyed it because it wasn't thick like a milk shake. This time, I decided to get the buffet instead of ordering from the menu... look at me, venturing out... hahah. The buffet was availale the first time as well but I hesitated because of a lunch experience I had at Tamarind. There lunch buffet wasn't very good and I was afraid that was the case here as well. I looked around and it looked like a lot of people were actually going to the buffet so I decided to go for it. The buffet was $12.99 - not bad at all considering, most dinner entrees are at least that much. You get naan, samosas, a number of vegetarian dishes and about 8 meat dishes from fish to chicken to goat. It was pretty good. We got there around 530 both times on a Monday and didn't have to wait but it started getting pretty crowded after 630. The servers were nice and polite, filled our water and cleared our plates promptly. I'm a fan and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"All the one star reviews are insanity. This is one of the very best buffet styled Indian restaurants around. The food is always consistently delicious and I've never left unsatisfied. The restaurant is usually clean and the staff are nice. This is a stellar, stellar place."}
{"text":"Their buffet is good value for the price. Wide range of protein foods, including vegetarian options. The only thing disappointed me was the absence of any fruits and samosa."}
{"text":"Please do not come to this place by looking at 175+ reviews with 4 star rating. Because I did the same mistake. Most of the reviews are from foreigners or restaurant relatives and friends.. I guess!!

After coming here, NOTHING is fresh and good. I came on a Saturday which should be usually good because of weekend. But it's terrible..!! 

Appetizer.. Naan..curry..veg and non veg.. Dessert.. Even a coke.. Oh myyyy... I've never had this kind of bad experience in any buffet across USA. 

You can try only one special glass of Water here..!! That's much better than anything else.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  The food was top notch and the service was even better.  Amazing, great value, and super fun!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Scottsdale, hands down!!!! Great service, the owner is very fun and exciting to be around plus the food is absolutely delicious. The restaurant itself is very eloquent with warm and pleasing atmosphere. Will come back again. If I could give the Taj Mahal 6 stars I would. Must see in old town."}
{"text":"OK food.
Loud Indian music videos with scantily clad women taking the attention away from our dinner.  
Glass pints of water placed in front of our 2 & 4 yr olds...recipe for disaster. 
Otherwise service was good. 
Food slow to table."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. The menu is quite extensive with a variety of options and traditional Indian fare. However, the service is not the quickest and it wouldn't hurt them to have a few extra employees working during peak dinner hours. Nonetheless, if you have the time to stop in and enjoy a meal it's definitely worth the wait or call ahead and order take out."}
{"text":"Never ever get their chicken. They use the lowest quality I've ever seen in my life. Its filled with the veins, tendons and fat. It used to be good but their ingredient quality went down hill quick. If you want to eat there just don't get any meat products or you'll regret it"}
{"text":"I've been to the buffet many times, as it's one of my dad's favorite places so we go each time he comes to town.  

The food at the Taj is tasty, but it's extremely unhealthy ~ often swimming in butter/grease.  Not only that, but the spiciness of the dishes is often inconsistent from visit to visit.  I assume this has to do with different cooks on different days.  

That said, the variety on the buffet is great and recently we have seen some new and interesting vegetable dishes added to the mix.  I would absolutely love to see samosa on the buffet more often.  It's rare and they're small, but it's like Christmas for my mouth when I see them. 

Because of the greasiness and inconsistency, I don't really order off the menu, as I assume it would be much of the same and more expensive.  I got the vegetarian thali platter once and it was OK, but I could tell they took items from the buffet and put them on my plate.

If I had one wish, I would love to see the food at the Taj become a healthier."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Tried the Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, and Goat curry all good and all worth ordering again!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food my wife and I have tried here in Scottsdale. This is a new establishment so still working through some kinks service and bar wise but the food was outstanding. 

Gil, the owner, has another outstanding Indian restaurant in Prescott and decided to start a restaurant here in Scottsdale, so glad he did! I have been to his restaurant in Prescott on two occasions when in town and was very impressed then so was surprised to learn of his newest venture while talking with him at the bar last night. His Prescott restaurant is located on Whiskey Row just southwest of the main town square and is huge.

We started with samosa's which were perfectly cooked and spiced along with flavorful sauces to accompany and also tried the mulligatawny soup which was very hardy and  delicious. Wife had chicken korma, son had curried goat and I tried mahi mahi vindaloo which was cooked perfectly with large chunks of moist fish in a spicy vindaloo sauce. Goat is always one of our favorite meals whenever dining and Taj Mahal did not disappoint with large pieces of tender fall off the bone goat in a flavorful curry. All sauces and spices were spot on inviting us to finish every morsel with the naan bread.

This is also a larger establishment located next to Dos Gringos with a full bar so please do yourself a favor and come down to the 5th Street corridor to try what we thought was definitely the best Indian food in the Valley. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got 3 stars. Amazing food, and amazing service. Will defiently be back!
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town hands down never had a bad  experience

The owner gill is super nice will come up and greet you at the table"}
{"text":"went for sunday lunch buffet. lots of variety. Lots of veggie/gluten free dishes. food was ok not out of the world delicious, but you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This has one of the widest buffet selections seen at an Indian restaurant. they have pakodas and even pav bhaji! Don't generally get to see that at buffets. The food is good. There is enough seating although the restaurant does get busy on the weekends for lunch buffet. Service is fair. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was even better.  You can't go wrong with the butter chicken. It was fresh and tasted wonderful. Great atmosphere and they had an excellent wine list. I highly recommend this amazing Indian restaurant. Very authentic and full of flavor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a great location in Old Town, without Old Town prices. AND the service is outstanding. AND the food is to die for.  It's probably the best Indian I've ever had (and that includes from London, where the Indian food is fantastic).

We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Cheese Naan, Saag Paneer, and Dahl.  I'd highly recommend all of them.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is creamy without being too buttery, and the flavors are strong without being overwhelming.  The Saag was cooked to perfection - it was thick and flavorful - not runny and soggy like some Saags I've had.  The Dahl was spiced perfectly - sometimes the lentils can be overpowering but Taj seasoned them just right so that they didn't take over the dish.  Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Indian food. The options are very healthy and fresh . I would highly recommend because the food is outstanding and great customer service. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"I'll give this restaurant two out of 5 stars. 
It's not a bad or wow Indian restaurant. However, I have experienced better than this restaurant. It is definitely very pricey ( expensive ) compared to other Indian restaurants. The chicken tikka masala was ok and the Nan bread was very good. However, the chicken curry was terrible that I felt it was not fresh and was smothered with accessive and confusing spices. The Shrimp Buriany was terrible that the rice was very dry and the shrimp was tasteless (not fresh) nor delicious. 

As far as service, it was good and the manager was awesome and respectful to me and to my wife. 

This is my personal and honest review and I hope it was helpful for you. And if the owner of the restaurant is reading this review, I hope it will help him better the quality of the food and service.

Thank you for reading my review."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We took friends who absolutely reject anything spicy, but, thanks to the server, Freddy, and the owner, they LOVED it!   We had four different main dishes, and three appetizers and all were fabulous.  You can easily choose the amount of spice you want, simply let the server know how much \"heat\"you like.   We definitely will return."}
{"text":"I do not know much about Indian food but I could eat the chicken tikka Masala and the garlic naan bread everyday!! The chicken masala sauce is so amazing.  I just told my husband that this has become my new favorite meal.  I have not tried much else from the restaurant just because I am so obsessed with the chicken masala sauce.  It is also my husbands favorite meal from the Taj.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  We sometimes dine in at the restaurant but we usually just order as take out.  Spice of 6-7.  You can not go wrong with the chicken tikka Masala and garlic naan! Make sure to dip your garlic naan in the masala sauce !"}
{"text":"Khana itna bura tha ki after returning from an indian buffet I am still hungry..that has never happened..usually I am cursing myself for overeating.
Had buffet with 4 other folks and everyone agreed, hands down the worst Indian buffet EVER!!
I have nothing good to say..nothing.
Old undercooked tasteless oily food.
Dirty tables and carpet.
I am sorry but this was terrible..plain terrible."}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch and was happy to see the buffet was still open and being stocked.

I tried several dishes and they were all pretty good.I really like the navratan korma.

Service was inattentive. The man behind the register was rather surly. 

I'd like to go back and order off the menu."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed by this restaurant mainly because it was extremely expensive for the quality of food and frankly I just wanted to finish the food I had and leave. The restaurant itself is nice but the food is not authentic indian food nor did it do indian food justice.   It did not have many  vegetarian options and again, it was over priced."}
{"text":"Okay so me and my husband were there to order some food around 9:20 on a Tuesday night and they apparently close at 10:00 as we entered the restaurant the mid age gentleman greeted us and handed us the menu so my husband decided on the taj special which comes with little bit of everything like lamb, chicken etc.when we were ready to order there was this Indian lady I guess the waiter came up and asked if we're ready when we said we want to order the taj special she made a face and said \"that will take 40 mins\" so we thought of changing our order then the mid aged came to take our order and he said it was fine to order the taj special and it would take 15-20 mins therefore, we ordered that. As we were waiting for the food the lady came back to us and said \"can you pay?\" Which I found extremely rude! After we paid she went to the only table that was there which was  a bunch of guys she told them to pay and leave because they're closed and it was only 9:55! She needs to get her attitude right before they lose their customers."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal has long been the very best Indian restaurant around.  The family and staff are always very nice people.  It is nice to see that people have discovered what great food they have here in recent years and that the place has been prosperous enough to expand.  Their buffet hits all the favorite dishes and endless naan."}
{"text":"Had the lamb  coconut was perfect...the nann was perfect the owner was entertaining if you don't wear your emotion on your shoulder"}
{"text":"If I could give it a higher rating, I would. One of the best Indian buffets around! When I come into the Pittsburgh area I always try to stop by for lunch. Lots of variety, great service, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"My five stars are for their weekend lunch buffet. So I am a critical eater when it comes to Indian food, especially in the states. I think in general there tend to be many places that have what I'd call \"American Indian\" food, and this is great and all, but I'm a fan of authenticity. This place has both authentic food from multiple regions across the country, but also does them really, really well. I don't know if they ever have a menu, but I strongly encourage you to take a culinary tour of India with Taj Mahal. 

The best thing I tried was the okra - I'm not always a fan of this veggie, and they had two different options, one with eggplant, and one solo but with lots of spice. Both were excellent. The naan was warm, fresh, and buttery. My dinner companions tried the goat curry and were raving about it! The chicken options were all very good. To top it all off, we ordered masala chai, which is EXCELLENT here! Do yourself a favor and get some chai!

If you are adventurous, they offer relatively mildly spiced options in many different styles. They would be a great place to take a vegetarian or vegan friend, too, since they are primarily vegetarian with vegan options. Bring a huge appetite, because they do not disappoint with quantity, and come on, it's a buffet!

Two huge thumbs up for the great job they do here! Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Very detailed menu. Food was outstanding. Service very good. I would recommend over other places. Calm setting for a Friday dinner. It was great for the date night we planned. Relax and enjoy a few dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Taj Mahal.  If you're not sure if you'll like Indian food, their buffet is a really cost effective and easy way to try a little bit of the staples.  The restaurant itself is clean, cozy and very sensible.  They are equipped to accommodate large parties, and the buffet runs several nights a week and everyday for lunch.  Parking is ample, if you don't mind McKnight road - it's not hard to get to either.

The staff are friendly, and the menu has really great selections.  I recommend giving them a try....a cornerstone of North Hills."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best buffet spreads in Pittsburgh!! Believe me, I'm a fattie and if there is one thing a fattie knows it is a good buffet when we see one! The wait staff is attentive and nice, the food is AMAZING, and the pretty cheap price makes it even better!!"}
{"text":"Always go for weekend lunch buffet and I can't get enough. So glad to have the Taj back in my life now that I'm back in PGH."}
{"text":"My dad had gotten some great reviews from a few coworkers and so our family decided to go here for my birthday when I was in town.  We were seated quickly and shown the buffet, but that was the extent of the service we received during our visit.  

Indian food, but definition, is rather spicy, so we all made decent dents in our waters in no time.  However, it seemed that our table couldn't been seen by anyone even though we were in the middle of the restaurant.  Several times a waiter passed our table without a glance but continued to refill the waters of other tables.  My dad finally had to flag a waiter down so we could order drinks (no one had even come to our table to take our drink order) and to get refills on water.  It almost felt as though our table was invisible: we had to ask for refills, to have our plates cleared, and even how to pay how to pay.  

I can honestly say I have no had such bad service at a restaurant before.  The fact that we were overlooked repeatedly while other customers received service was absolutely absurd.  We were by no means needy, rude, or loud.  In fact, I'd argue we were the exact opposite.

I doubt my family will return to this restaurant.  No matter how good the food was (and it definitely was good), the bad hospitality took away from it.  The food may be good, but it can't save the fact the service was horrendous."}
{"text":"I saw something distastefull at the end of my dinner that changed my opinion of the restaurant. When we were about to leave, I saw one of the waiters was taking back the leftover sauces and dips (that customers had eaten from) and poured them back into the large containers instead of throwing them away and replacing them with new ones. It was unbelievable to me that they were not even doing that back in the kitchen, but in full view of customers; not that it would be right either way. I am not the only person who is not interested in eating other people's leftovers."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley! Loads of yummy vegan options which is very appreciated. The portion sizes are perfect. The service is awesome and so friendly. The owner is the warmest most hospitable man. He and the server remember us every time we come in. You feel like family. First discovered Taj Mahal at their Prescott location and were super excited to find out they have a Scottsdale location. Excited to come back!"}
{"text":"My son and I tried this place for the first time, and were very pleasantly surprised. Food was excellent. I would have given 5 stars, but the staff was not very friendly, and it takes a while to get their attention."}
{"text":"I don't give out five star ratings, but giving a four doesn't mean the best

Got here late, around 845 on a weeknight. Still a few people at the bar and a few tables being served, so I went ahead and looked at all of the pictures from the reviews and decided that I would just simply get a regular chicken tikka. Not very adventurous, but look, I've done my fair share of obscure and 'weird' Indian food in the past, so I have no problem keeping it mainstream sometimes. Also, at every type of cuisine restaurant, there are a few main dishes that you can use to gauge the quality of food there. For Italian, you try a place's lasagna and chicken parm to find out if they know what they're doing or if they're pulling your leg. At an Indian joint, you go for the chicken tikka. If you got a winner there, you consider coming back for more. So that's what I did and do.

I ordered it medium spicy, and I was very pleased with the results. The chicken was nice and tender and spiciness level of the sauce was not too spicy for my palate. They gave me complimentary rice which was actually delicious. Not too sticky, not too buttery. By the way, have you heard the one about the butter? If not, I'm sorry, but I can't tell you (it might spread).

I literally ate everything on the rice and the chicken. I laid the rice out on my plate and poured my chicken onto it. Good move on my part. I also ordered the garlic flavored na'an bread and you know what? That was delicious as well. An Indian joint that touts their home-baked na'an and doesn't pull through with quality bread is a big no-no. But this place definitely pulled-through with the bread. 

Now, like I said, I've been to many Indian places in my life. There are a few really good ones around my home, but this place is a little bit more on the expensive side, and the reason for that is because we are paying their rent. This is a nice, upscale restaurant, with nice interior decoration. I don't know if they did their decoration themselves or whether they bought an existing restaurant that failed and converted it over (more likely the situation given the non-Indian motif), but nonetheless it is a nicely decorated restaurant in an expensive part of Old Town Scottsdale, and so of course they're going to pass their rent on to us. Not a problem if you don't mind paying a few extra bucks and keeping things local.

It seems to be a family-run operation, and though I was not pleased to see children working there late at night, I understand that this is part of their culture. I guess I feel that although the food was on the expensive side, that the the quality and the taste and flavor as well as the service were all there, and I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant to try different items on their menu in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet and reasonable. Try their authentic Chai tea. We enjoyed BYOB."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I went in for lunch while visiting Pittsburgh hoping they had a few vegetarian options. I was very wrong. They had more vegetarian options than non vegetarian. The food was a little oily for my palate but the flavors were on point. I will definitely go back once I'm in town."}
{"text":"I like certain days when the dishes are spicy . Love the variety"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner, amazing ambience, wonderful food. The tikka masala and garlic naan were mouthwatering ! A must visit whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend for lunch. The food was amazing! I had the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious! It was in the medium hot spice level , which was perfect for me. We also split the assorted naan....you can never have too much naan! Plus, it was perfectly made. Cute place and great food. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"best authentic Indian food this side of Jackson Heights in the Bronx. fresh, hot, moist and delicious. not swimming in sauce. lunch buffet is awesome."}
{"text":"Good food. Wonderful staff. Little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet and I'm obsessed.  Highly reccomend! I love the Chana masala... everything was super fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Scottsdale that I have found so far. They are consistent with their recipes and I highly recommend the butter chicken dish. Order mild-medium if you want a mild heat, go medium if you want any heat."}
{"text":"So many positive reviews, I just had to give it a go.  I ordered online and got it as take out, which for someone with absolutely no experience with Indian food, was a real challenge.  Now my review is 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to.  The food was really good,  the portion sizes were great, their rice which is so frequently messed up, was cooked perfectly.  The naan bread or as I got kolacha I think it was called was super soft and delicate and beautiful, I want to try other favors.  The chicken chettinand was very nicely flavored, though the chicken was a bit dry, (common with a stewed chicken breast). Ultimately, worth trying out, good food, good price and I don't know that you could go wrong."}
{"text":"NO.

Go elsewhere.

I truly hate giving one star reviews but the service we had here was just so terrible I pulled a waiter aside and asked if we'd done something offensive.

We had to beg for silverware ask for menus asked for water ask someone to take our order ask someone to check to see if I order was ready to come out ask for our check it was absolutely ridiculous I will never dine in here ever again and you shouldn't either.

Update...  I was not kidding when I said it pains me to give a one star review, because I don't think any restaurant or services that bad except for Pittsburgh taxi companies.  I feel like everyone is entitled to have a bad day. I upped this review to 2 stars because the owner of the restaurant was kind enough to contact me and apologize for the bad service, an offer me a free meal on my next visit. I thought that was very nice and very classy and he credited the situation due to being understaffed. It was a very nice gesture. I'm not sure if I would go back, the food was good but I didn't mention that this was my third visit. Maybe I'll go back to the Taj Mahal the future but I probably won't go out of my way to dine here again. However I do think it was very nice of the owner to contact me."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Indian in the city. Blows most other places out of the water. Sometimes the quality on the chicken is hit or miss, but other than that it's awesome. I usually get take out, but the buffet looks really good."}
{"text":"I've had Indian food from many places around the world, but not like this. The Lamb Korma, normally a hot and spicy dish, tasted of meat covered in a sweet gravy like one might pour over a poutine or Pain Perdu. I shared the chicken Tikka with my dining partner and it was no better. Additionally, the garlic naan had no garlic flavor to speak of. 

A sweet lamb is something you should see frolicking in a meadow and not a savory meal served at an Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST. INDIAN. FOOD. EVER.  I love their buffet because they have chicken tikka masala - my favorite next to vindaloo (which they don't have in buffet).  Oh, and I also go nuts over the naan and the mango yogurt they have (also in the buffet).  The buffet is only on certain days (I don't remember which days, so I would call and ask).  They recently had a renovation and it's really nice, with a bar.  So yes, they officially have a liquor license.  

I like how they serve the dishes (if you order from menu) with little tea candles under the serving plates to keep your meals warm.  They also have a very dedicated staff.  I have seen the same staff for over 10 years. 

The owner is very nice.  It's very customer oriented.  I used to go all the time (when I lived in Pittsburgh) and there are times where I would stop in to just get tandori roti to take home as a snack.  Th owner recognizes me and would just give the tandori roti gratis, saying it's just bread.  Not only did I just pay for the tandori roti as tip, I kept going back as a dine in patron because I absolutely am a fan of being recognized as a regular.  And the fact that he said 'it's just bread' tells me he doesn't see his patrons as dollar signs.   

Truly, I am not biased by this.  I have always been a Taj regular and every time I visit Pittsburgh, I make sure to make a trip there even if I have to go out of my way.  I have gone to many Indian places:  others in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, LA, NYC, Philadelphia... Taj Mahal still takes home the cake.  Hands down."}
{"text":"For me, it's hard to find an Indian food restaurant that meets my standards in both authenticity and flavor. Taj Mahal definitely surprised me. It's unfortunate that you wouldn't know it exists in Oldtown Scottsdale unless you went out of your way to find it, but what an unexpected treasure it is. The fact that they were able to accommodate on spice level for my boyfriend was wonderful, and the spice level of my own dishes was pleasant and not overpowering like some can be. The owner even came over to introduce himself. This place has a great atmosphere like what you would expect in Scottsdale, but the personal touch of making us feel welcomed and appreciated for coming in really made the whole experience for us. Would recommend to anyone, however be aware that at dinner time, ordering from the menu can really add up! We had a bill of over $70, but it was still worth it."}
{"text":"Food quality is very good weather its the buffet or your ordering food. 
They have alot of vegetarian/vegan options which is very great! They have meat too .

They also have spicy options so everyone in my group felt accommodated. 
I was very full after eating here and I felt healthy after eating here its all veggies and beans it was very filling and satisfying. 

They have a good location near the mall so you can eat and then shop off the gain or you can shop to build an appetite and then eat. They have a lot for parking so thats nice. only con is that the location is small so you will feel crowded  if its busy. and the buffet hours are brief  

I recommend to all my friends, and I'll def be coming back"}
{"text":"I did do a takeout at this place and frankly it was not my first choice. I ended up ordering from this restaurant only because Mintt was closed, it being a Monday. I ordered a Chicken Biryani (Spicy), Aloo(Potato) Kulcha, Chicken Hyderabad(Spicy). 
I must say the food was beyond expectation as the previous buffet fiasco had set the bar too low. The Kulcha was soft and had ample filling of lightly spiced potato. The hyderabad chicken was spicy and flavorful. The gravy was rich and thick with the onions having been sauteed very well. The Biryani was also the right amount of spicy with good flavor. It was however Kacchi Biryani(Not the dum variety). I got some Jeera Rice with the chicken dish which was nothing out of the ordinary. The rice was a little crunchy though. The raita with the biryani was simple and effective. It took the richness away form the biryani, exactly what it is supposed to do. 
All in all a very good experience. I had to wait a while though for the food to be ready, but if the food is this good I wouldn't mind waiting the 5 odd minutes. 
One beef that I still have with this restaurant is the option of white/dark meat for the chicken dishes is not available. I do not like the breast pieces/ white meat of the chicken as it is less flavorful and absorbs less spices from the curry. Moreover it is also very chewy and not soft like the dark meat(thigh/legs)."}
{"text":"Ordered veg samosa, butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo. Everything was good but I particularly liked the vindaloo sauce. Service was attentive and excellent."}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place! I've been searching for good Indian cuisine in Arizona for some time now. I'm originally from NYC and feel like I'm a connoisseur if Indian cuisine. I've finally found it at Taj Mahal. The food is awesome. It is seasoned just right and an explosion of flavors for your palate. I've been eating mostly vegetarian and they had numerous vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I really look forward to returning and trying more dishes. The added bonuses are the atmosphere and the service. The restaurant has a great and cozy decor that is clean and welcoming. Most importantly was the service. Our server Sandra was awesome! She was super friendly and attentive! The owner, Gil, is a great guy as well! He has super positive energy! He visits ever table to make sure you're satisfied and just has an infectious upbeat happy energy that rubs off! I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Small portions do not justify the high prices! Ordered two items.
Chicken tikka masala was good downside 3 chicken tikka pieces and enough gravy to fulfill one naan. 
Chicken Briyani: nothing special- undercooked rice not flavorful. Disappointed."}
{"text":"we went to this restaurant took forever get our food and top of this they refused to give us discount on our meal. the owner got violent and push my cousin."}
{"text":"What a great experience I had!
All from just a simple order out. I think my guy was named Ruben, not sure but he was AMAZING. 
My pick up person was running late and he called to make sure they were coming and even made sure to send my food back to the kitchen to make sure it was hot when I received it. 
I ordered Lamb Biriyani and it was really tasty! 
Love this place :) home away from home."}
{"text":"Love this as take out or delivery. Have not tried in house yet, but it has always been good as delivery. Great when I need a curry and naan fix."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian buffet that I had in Pittsburgh. I came here with a friend on Saturday during lunch. The parking lot is pretty small and spaces are pretty limited. We were seated and you were able to grab food right away. I really enjoyed the variety they had available. I tried almost everything including the lamb curry which I enjoyed. The selection ranged from vegan food to chicken and lamb. I also like the dessert that they had, especially the one with rice and a sweet white paste. I would definitely recommend this place during their lunch buffet which was $10.99"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whether it's for the buffet, or if we are ordering off the menu, the food never leaves us disappointed.  The staff is always helpful as well. 

We tend to stick to the same few things- chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken because we have never been disappointed.  The naan is always fresh and there is something about their rice that I enjoy more than other places I have been.  The buffet has allowed us to explore quite a few different other things that we have come to enjoy as well.  And the biggest surprise to me is how very cheap it is. 

If you are looking for the buffet, make sure it's a day where they have it as they don't always have it for dinner."}
{"text":"As somebody who was born and raised in the sub-continent I am intimately familiar with Indian and Pakistani cuisine. 
I dined here with my family to celebrate the second anniversary of my wife's passing away. She was a superb cook who excelled in preparing Indian and Pakistani food. She and I often frequented restaurants that served this type of cuisine, all over the United States: New York, Chicago, San Francisco, LA, etc etc. 
One of our pet peeves was that the vast majority of Indian restaurants appear to prepare one curry that is used for different kinds of dishes. That means that whether you order chicken curry, lamb curry or beef curry they all taste the same. Also the curries are chock full of cream. 
But let's cut to the chase. Taj Mahal is an Indian restaurant, but it does not suffer from this dilemma. Each of the 5-6 dishes we ordered were unique in their taste. And yes the dishes were quite good. 
The owner was present when we dined and he personally attended to us. That's impressive. 
However, I must say that the prices are egregiously high. Perhaps it's so because of the high rent district the restaurant is located in. But price conscious customers like me may find it hard to afford this place. 
I prefer a Pakistani restaurant, Hilal Grill, in Phoenix. The food at Hilal Grill is as good, if not better, than at Taj Mahal. And it's much more affordable. Yes it's not in downtown Scottsdale but who cares. 
Aficionados of good food will go to great lengths to relish good offerings. 
So, if money is not an issue, Taj Mahal May be your choice. But for the same or better quality I'd rather go to other options."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends the other night and everyone enjoyed dinner.

They serve Indian beer here. Not sure what to think of it, I had a glass just because it was there. Not much of light beer type but glad I got to try once.

Vegetable samosa was very good. I really liked the sauce came with it. I set it aside to eat with rice later as they were that good.

For dinner, we shared three different curry. My favorite was lamb korma. I tend to order lamb korma at every Indian restaurant as I know that's one dish seemed to be always consistent and I know I will enjoy. I don't have much experience with Indian food, so I try something new every time. This time was egg plant vegetable curry. It didn't have that of good flavor for me, they were okay, I probably won't order it again. Fish curry on the other hand was good. Not as good as lamb but curry had nice flavor to it, I wouldn't mind trying it again.

Service was very friendly. It was a slow weekday night. Owner came over to talk to us often and he was really funny. Service was prompt. Nice decor and ambiance, it was a good experience for me."}
{"text":"Bit costly but food is really good. Owner talks too much.  Authentic north Indian Punjabi food. Chicken curry is seriously delicious."}
{"text":"It might just be me, but if you're one of three tables in a large restaurant and you've waited for 10mins for someone to ask if you'd like a drink - it's time to go. They may have decent food, but you're rolling the dice on whether you'll wait to eat. I'm currently writing this review from the Jewel of the Crown, eating."}
{"text":"Being an Indian, I mostly find it difficult to appreciate Indian food here. I always find Indian food here too greasy and buttery. That being said, Taj mahal is one of the better places in Pittsburgh for Indian food. I had the dinner buffet, which has a huge variety of items, and is very economical."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food we have had in quite a while - everything was fresh, tasty and great quality. The naan was some of the best I have ever had across the globe!"}
{"text":"I've tried MANY Indian restaraunts and the food at Taj Mahal is definitely the best of the best. The meats are tender and succulant. The sauces are rich and perfectly seasoned. The atmosphere is clean and welcoming. My ONLY complaint about this restaraunt is that the servers are often very slow and forgetful. For example, I've asked for coffee in the past and have literally never received it. I've often had to get up and retrieve my own extra napkins and takeout containers as well. It definitely hinders the \"eating out\" experience as I expect more from serving staff. The buffet is definitely the time to go as you can really enjoy a large variety of dishes. In addition, I've noticed that the wait staff is far less \"frazzled\" when they do not have to bring people's entrees to each table. I would LOVE it if they went back to having a buffet all of the time, however it is now only available on weekends during lunch. I know of many other Indian food lovers who are very upset about this change."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to AZ I've been on a search for amazing Indian food and I'm happy to say I've found my new spot!! Their chicken tikka masala, veggie samoas, aloo chole and of course garlic naan are all AMAZING! Service is always on point. Keep up the great work I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I honestly thought twice about writing this review because I was worried our hidden gem of a restaurant would become too crowded! 

This is the first Indian restaurant I've ever been to where the chef came out to discuss our dinner order to make sure it was perfect! The atmosphere was relaxing and the drinks amazing! I would highly recommend this...we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Taj Mahal for the buffet on a Saturday night and left wishing I could triple the size of my stomach.  The buffet was filled with a wide variety of dishes, such as goat curry, chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, palak paneer, channa masala... and tons of other delicious options.  While I am 100% carnivore, there were definitely plenty of vegetarian options available for those who don't eat things with faces and I didn't even miss the meat while eating them.  The service was excellent and they kept the buffet well-stocked but everything was hot and tasted fresh.  There was a decent amount of spice to the dishes but nothing to sweat over, so if you like your Indian food super spicy you may be better off ordering from the menu.  For anyone new to Indian food, they also give descriptions of what most of the dishes include along with the name.

I have not been to Taj Mahal for regular entrees, and if they are anything like the buffet then they are certainly worth a trip, but I would go back for the buffet any day.  It is unfortunate that they don't have it every day (they do for lunch, but dinner is only on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday) or I just might!"}
{"text":"We went here for a lunch buffet, which cost only $10 per person. The selection included chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, malai kofta, basmati rice, chick peas, naan, and many other foods. The quality and taste of the food was good. The waiter refilled our drinks often."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything good about this restaurant. It was stuffy, no air ventilation, the food was nothing that was expected based on the photos and reviews. The waiters kept forgetting what we ordered.
The menus we received were dirty with oily fingerprints, very disappointing.
When I asked the waiter what's the wi-fi password, he said, \"It's there!\" and pointed to the entrance door. I had to go all the way to the entrance to find it.
The food we received was nothing special. My wife's dish was very oily and the butter chicken I ordered was very average, a dish would not order again. Some dishes we had to send back either the way they looked or tasted."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I were looking for a great Indian Restaurant in Scottsdale. And find it we did.  Atmosphere, location and ambiance were all great.  Even had Ballywood on the screen over the bar.  There is a variety of seating which is nice for different sized groups.  The food is truly 5 stars.  We had plain naan, veggie samosas, raita, panir masala and veggie kofta.  The service was good, and the owner and staff were all very nice.  It was great to find such a nice place in downtown!"}
{"text":"I would give the buffet (lunch and dinner) a hearty 4 stars, but my experiences of ordering from the menu 2 stars, hence the average 3 star rating...

The menu for the restaurant is huge; it's basically a book, including North Indian, South Indian, Indo-Chinese and more! The few times I've ordered from the menu, it took a very long time and the service was off (like we got our rice 10 minutes after our entrees and that sort of thing). Plus ordering one or two menu items is not nearly as exciting as the buffet, so in comparison, it makes no sense to come for anything but the awesome buffet. Note, dinner buffet is only offered on Mon., Thurs. and Sat. and is not to be missed!

The buffet is splendorous; with tons of variety, many vegetarian and vegan options and lots of extras, (like fresh naan, samosas, pakoras, sambar, pickles, desserts, multiple chutneys, sometimes dosas...things other buffets often skimp on). It's the most comprehensive Indian buffet I've ever seen. The spice levels vary from dish to dish and they will put out some medium spicy items here, which I love, while spice intolerant people should be warned. Much of the food is very greasy. I consider my occasional trips here to be indulgent, guilty pleasures."}
{"text":"The service was great it was a slow night but very friendly staff I can't really find anything bad to say the food was alright alright I enjoyed it I wish I got something really spicy which I did ask for but aside from that I would go there again.

Really decent location as well and walking distance from other places of night life interest"}
{"text":"Food was really tasty. I loved the saag paneer as well as the lamb. Their assorted naan bread basket was really nice. We will be back"}
{"text":"Really really really impressive lunch buffet.  I've been there for dinner a few times and it has always been outstanding...... And I would normally expect less from a buffet, but they killed it. All of the food was such high-quality, with an excellent array of options.  I hadn't been here in a few years, so happy I went back."}
{"text":"The owner was nice. We went on a Thursday during their dinner buffet. The selection is large. Their spicy chicken was hands down amazing. They also had some specialty dishes I've never had before. If you're into trying new things I definitely recommend. Probably one of the best Indian places in all of pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food was served with oil and taste was not good. For vegetarians they don't have much option. Even tandoori chicken had full plate of oil in it. My 1 star is only for staff, they were polite and friendly. But for food its negative star. Please improve your food quality."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Indian buffet in the Pittsburgh area. It's a bit far out but it's worth the drive. The space is large, bright, and pretty clean, while the service was very welcoming. In terms of food, the selection is huge and everything is delicious. They have multiple chicken trays, a bomb goat curry, rice and noodles, as well as a number of vegetable curries and dishes. I think it's quite possible to get full before getting to try everything. Not to mention the fresh naan that they bring over to your table and the large choice of desserts. It is definitely a great value for the price of the dinner buffet."}
{"text":"Located on St. Paul Street in Old Montreal Taj Mahal offers Authentic Indian Food. Frankly I don't expect a lot from places located in touristy areas. But Taj Mahal proved me wrong. The restaurant pretty much has no decor. Just tables and chairs crammed into a room. Service is not too fast. My rating for em till this point was 2.5 stars. Then the server brought the complimentary poppadoms with the sauces. They were really crisp & tasty. We ordered the Chicken Vindaloo & Lamb Madras with Garlic Naan & Basmati rice. Both the vindaloo & Madras had a zing to it. The chicken was perfectly cooked, so was the lamb. The nan's were freshly baked and the rice was fluffy & aromatic. One of the best Indian places I've been to in Montreal. The ratings jump to 4 stars. The service might seem slow, but I guess cooking something well does take time. I'd say while you wait for your entree's, sip on to Indian beer (Though I'm not a big fan) or some White wine (Goes really well with spicy food). The place is a bit pricey, but its Old Montreal, Touristy area.... blah blah. But yeah definitely worth a visit 


Food -  Really Good
Service - Ok
Ambiance -Pls message me if you find an Indian restaurant with good ambiance. 
Worth the money - Oui"}
{"text":"I had some type of over cooked grilled chicken; the kids of the owners seem to be the wait staff and they clearly don't communicate with each other, the kids don't want to be there, they will forget half your meal, I even still left a tip, i called the manager a few times and I was yelled at for calling too much, they thought i was trying to sell something to them??  awfully weird, I hate to see locally owned places near my neighborhood go down hill like this, and pleas stop leaving your dairy products in the sun your going to make people ill, yikes! come on now!"}
{"text":"For September's international supper club UYE Taj Mahal was the place picked to meet at.

It's a newer place in old town Scottsdale, so they are still working on some kinks, at times it did seem as if service was slow, but so extremely friendly. We were a big group of 20, so it's somewhat expected.

I knew what I wanted before I even got there, I had been craving chicken tikka masala, just had to have it! So I ordered the chicken tikka masala and some onion naan bread.

The naan bread was packed with sautéed diced onions, it was crispy and soft at the same time and had great flavor! 

The chicken tikka masala, oohh my sweet heaven, this was some of the best chicken tikka masala I have had in years! I ordered it at medium heat level and it was good, next time I will go a tad bit hotter.  The chicken was so tender and juicy, and the sauce, oh sweet Jesus the sauce was just heavenly! I really wanted to lick my bowl clean, however I did not haha. The portions look small, but honestly it's the perfect amount, I was full and content with having eaten one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

Looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes!"}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant I've ever tasted. This is my third time ordering by Postmate and each time it's gotten better. My favorites are butter chicken, tandoori chicken with yogurt sauce. Cheese and garlic naan is legit. Well deserved stars!!"}

{"text":"Visited this place laste for lunch on the day before Christmas. It was a Saturday and they had buffet for lunch. One of the few places to have a variety of dishes. Most places don't have so many curries. We were there for a late lunch - hence, it was not too crowded. Chole, Malai Kofta was quite good. Butter Chicken, too tasted very authentic. Deserts were the highlight though. Was very happy with the kheer - optimum thickness, sugar & spice. The Halwa was very good too. Tasted like home made halwa. Overall - a good experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here. The food is good and the servers are nice. Try the lamb chops!"}
{"text":"Haven't here in awhile for the buffet. It was great! Chicken tikka Marsala, naan. Mango for dessert. Try it if you haven been here."}
{"text":"Went the first night to try it out for great Indian food. (Based on all the reviews.) MAN was it delicious! The atmosphere is really nice and pretty with a nice setup in the restaurant. The owner happened to be there and had a nice chat with us since there wasn't a lot of customers at the time. (Cusses like a sailor but humorous too!) He even gave us free desserts! The only downside of this restaurant is the portion sizes run about $16.99+ for a small bowl with rice. Their naan is also terrific (they have assorted naan too!) Overall, if you want delicious Indian, and don't mind the prices, then by all means! Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"We have been to so many Indian Cuisines and this one is the BEST over all! Food is booming with flavor and the employees are grade A with customer service! Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have tasted since I moved to America. I am from Delhi and I never thought I could find a place that would be any good as compared to restaurants back home. But this place is incredibly amazing even for authentic Indian standards. I have taken many friends there and refer this place to every person who wants to try Indian food. If you are new to Indian food, do try their dinner buffet. It has a variety of options and helps you find out the flavors that appeal to you. And don't be overwhelmed by 240 different items on the menu. Just ask the host, he would definitely come up with some great options based on your preference. Not just the food, I simply love the hospitality of this place!"}
{"text":"No pictures on this comment because we ate it all too fast. It was DELICIOUS! The lentil soup tasted very fresh and the Chicken Tikka Masala sauce was addictive. The owner Gil and server were very welcoming and amicable. We will definitely return and will make it one of our \"go to\" places to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The lamb Samosas and chicken Pakora were the best we've tasted! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the owner recognized me from my last visit over a year ago! Great ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal offers a solid lunch buffet for only $8.99 during the week!

I was very happy with the selection included in the buffet, which has apps, entrees, & dessert.  They also feature an entree (either daily or weekly, I can't quite remember) in the buffet to ensure you get to try different things if you make multiple visits.  I was also impressed with the aesthetics of the restaurant.  It is clear that the owners put their profits back into the business.  Since we had the buffet, I don't have much to highlight in terms of services - no complaints, no major compliments.  I'd certainly be back if in the area and want to try their non-buffet options at some point as well."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food, if you are unsure of what you like they have a daily buffet and it is amazing !"}
{"text":"I have eaten at every Indian restaurant in the valley and I can say with 100% confidence that Taj Mahal is by far the best! If you are concerned with the higher prices at Taj Mahal that is because it is well worth the extra two dollars per dish. The saag paneer and lamb boti masala is worth going there just for those 2 dishes.  If you love Indian food you MUST eat here.  Plus, the owner is friendly and hilarious."}
{"text":"This place is very good!! I've been to the one in Prescott before and both places are equally satisfying. I like their garlic nan bread. If you're in the mood for Indian cuisine this is the spot."}
{"text":"Three of us went for the buffet on a Saturday evening around 7 pm.  We waited for about 10 minutes in the foyer-area and were then quickly seated.  Taking the advice of other yelpers, we all decided to have the buffet and weren't disappointed in the least. There were many choices, both vegetarian and meat, from which to choose, including soups and desserts.  Naturally, some dishes are spicier than others, which makes for a nice treat for someone who like hot and spicy food.  While my companions were able to try nearly everything on the buffet, there were a few items that I was just too full to eat. (Next time!)

Over the course of the hour or so that we spent in the restaurant, I noticed that buffet items were constantly being replenished by the kitchen staff.  (This, I suppose, explains why all of the dishes I tried tasted fresh.)  My only complaint is that it took quite some time to order a glass of wine from the fully stocked bar.  The waitstaff seemed more interested in seating people than waiting tables, so I'm not sure how easy it would be to order off the regular menu on a busy evening.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable and delicious meal.  I'll definitely return for the buffet again.

TIP: You pay the gentleman sitting at the bar in the front of the restaurant, not your waiter."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal is hands down the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  As a American born Indian kid, I am very picky but this place never disappoints. My favorites are the seekh kebab or aloo paratha."}
{"text":"First time visitor. I have tried many indian restaurants and food here was not up to the standard. Quantity was also very less compared to other indian restaurants. The owner was very unprofessional, when I asked him do they serve complementary rice with chicken items as other restaurants do, he started asking which restaurants and other questions. Also he was not very polite and I didn't like his behavior. I asked for onions with nan and the waiter said even that is chargeable. I may not return there."}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. It's only a few miles from my house, but of course taking the bus there involves a trip downtown and then back out... but I digress.

My friend and I went on a Monday night, forgetting it was buffet night, and were really excited about that. Everything was excellent. Bonus points for naan and samosas on the buffet table, and EXTRA bonus points for Indian Chinese -- Chilli Chicken was sitting there just waiting to be eaten. And lo, it was amazing.

Plenty of pakora, chicken tikka, goat curry, lots of dal, chana masala, and not one but two paneer dishes. The requisite chutneys were present, thankfully (because what's life without tamarind chutney?), along with raita and even hummus.

Dessert offerings included gulab jamun (my favorite), rice pudding (maybe also my favorite), and mango pudding (which could, in fact, be my favorite). There were also small pieces of cake(?) of a sort I've never had before; the tops were frosted in silver leaf and I'm pretty sure there was rosewater involved. Lots of rosewater. For $10 and a tip, it's really an unbeatable value.

During buffet time things are a bit crowded since the place isn't huge to begin with, but it's worth it.

I've also had takeaway: Samosa chaat, which was delicious and just right at a medium (5) spice level -- although I didn't detect any yogurt, which made me sad -- and chicken kulcha. The latter starred plenty of cilantro and was absolutely delicious.

4/11 GOBHI MANCHURIAN: Went for the buffet again recently and had a sweet and sour cauliflower dish, Gobhi Manchurian, from the Indo-Chinese menu. It was phenomenal. I thought it had quite a kick, but the BFF couldn't detect it; possibly to do with the distribution of peppers. After eating half a plate I was kind of tired of it, but I find myself craving it something fierce now."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Delicious and flavorful food. Came from out of town and was told this was the spot in Scottsdale. I would definitely come back when I'm in town :) Owner is welcoming and kind. And the server was amazing and friendly!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across the Prescott Taj Mahal one afternoon during a visit there. I was very wary about eating Indian food in Prescott, AZ, but I was hungry and had no idea where to eat. Sometimes things just work out. The food was phenomenal and, to my delight, the waiter said that they were opening another Taj Mahal in Scottsdale (near where I live). Within a week of when it opened, I went there (and took three others) to try it out. Once again, the food was delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes there. My favorites include Chicken Madras and Chicken Vindaloo. Great naan too! I highly recommend this place if you like good Indian."}
{"text":"Child labor. I encourage you to look at Sandra's reply. This is obviously a very angry and disturbed woman. You would have to be disturbed to use child labor to begin with. She is clearly trying to save herself and her business. The humiliation of breaking the law and treating their customers poorly must really be getting to her. She was incredibly rude to my wife and my wife was the one who pointed out her unpleasant attitude and demeanor. The only reason they have so many good reviews is because they offer free naan with a yelp review. Not a good experience last night. To begin, the appetizers we ordered were lamb samosas. They were terribly seasoned and way too salty. No too spicy--too salty. Waaayyyyyyy too salty. 
Here's the REAL REVIEW: We felt very judged and spoken down to by the corpulant woman walking around the dining room. I hate to be crass, and normally I would not be so crass, but we were treated horribly. There are a hundred more appropriate and refined words I could use, but the white lady, Sandra, (we are also both white) with vitaligo is a b**** (I find this description highly appropriate) (maybe she's the manager, maybe the bartender or just a hostess). I think that's the perfect word to describe her. She slammed her sweaty hands down on the table and informed us that we couldn't combine a Groupon with the yelp check-in offer, which was fine. She seemed to make a much bigger deal out of this than we did or would have. She seemed offended that we even asked. We told her it was totally fine and that we would happily use the Groupon instead of the check in offer. It's not like we're hurting for money. This is scottsdale. We are two young professionals with great careers. It is rare that I leave a bad review (check my profile). However, the way she smugly and angrily delivered this news along with her condescending attitude, speaking to us like were were stupid or cheap, is why I am writing this review. You can see in her response she does accuse me of being cheap (I was going to leave nothing, my wife left her the dollar). She was exceedingly rude to us throughout this unfortunate dining \"experience\". I presume this is because one or a combination of several reasons, perhaps because of how nicely my wife and I were dressed in designer clothing (which is the norm in PV, we had just come from Neiman Marcus), or perhaps because of our sports car parked out front (clearly visible from the entranyway) in relation to our young age or perhaps it was simply because we asked to be seated near the window rather than near the young children sitting at the bar. Regardless, when serving others you should exude politeness as that is your job. We had been nothing but polite as customers from the moment we arrived. She has been giving us awful looks since we got here, especially to my wife. There are loud Indian children sitting AT THE BAR. I'm pretty sure this is illegal and will be posting the pictures of these obviously underage kids playing their videogames at the alcoholic bar. The food was mediocre and not at all authentic. We will not be back even if the food was better--because of this unfortunate and angry woman. Indian paradise is WAY better. We also asked the girl pouring our water how old she was. Guess what she said? \"I'm 11.\" They have 11 year olds working here. That is illegal and we will be reporting them. I'll also be posting pictures. I can tell you this, we will not be leaving north scottsdale to eat. The only reason we even went here was becaise my wife is an avid grouponer and it was close to the mall. EDIT: You don't get rich by throwing money away. You shoukd kever criticize someone for using a promotion that your business is offering no matter how much money you think they do or don't have. Sandra, allow me to loosely quote you \"I knew from the moment you didn't get your naan you were giving us a one star review ....\" and you want to accuse us of discrimination? You may think were were rude, but at least we aren't servers. Go do something with your life other than taking out your own insecurities on others. Even if you want to be a server, be a better server. We will be spreading this on Facebook and to our friends. I find it hilarious and sad that you found the need to send such a lengthy response. You probably voted for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders and have the gall to talk about hard work in America. I stand by everything I said. This woman is just trying to save her own a**. (to be crass and \"unprofessional\" again."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. I always order the goat curry which has the best seasonings/sauce (order it hot!). The wife always gets the Butter Chicken. Bomb! Gil, the owner, is really nice and entertaining. Great place in Old Town for Indian food."}
{"text":"The BEST Indian cuisine in all of Phoenix! I recommend the Shrimp Coconut (my favorite), Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala & Lamb Vindaloo. Basmati rice and a Garlic Naan for dipping in the rich delicious sauces accompanying each dish is a great addition."}

{"text":"Such great Indian food. I got coconut chicken and my girlfriend got vegetable curry. Perfect amount of spice, great service and the food was amazing. They also gave us a 20% off coupon for next time!"}
{"text":"Five stars for food, drink and an excellent atmosphere to try authentic Indian cuisine. The menu is full of siganture Indian dishes along with some beautiful flavors found with their fish and lamb dishes. As a foodie, I am extemely picky about where and how my favorite flavors of India are represented...Taj Mahal in Old Town Scottsdale is the real deal! Come for the lunch buffet or come later for amazing appetizers, tastebud crazy dinner selections ( ask for it spicey!) and wash it all down with authentic Indian beer with a fruitful wine selection."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Prompt service and was ready within 20 minutes. Ordered the following: lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and cheese naan. The meats were cooked to perfection and the naan was great to soak up the sauce. Only drawback was it was a little pricey for the amount of food per dish, but the flavor made up for it. Definitely would go/order again"}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food and decided to grab takeout from here.  Could not decide between Chicken Makhani and Butter Chicken (I always thought they were the same thing?), so I ordered both!  And, so glad that I did!  It was just what my body was craving after a night of adult beverages ;)"}

{"text":"I took my mother there to turn her on to Indian food. It didn't work out well. Okay, the restaurant was under construction when we went there, so I'll assume that they are not at their best. Also, we arrived during the buffet (I, personally, hate buffets of any cuisine). Still, we gave it a shot.

The parking lot... REEKED of rotting garbage. Arriving and departing were both very unpleasant. The place is in progress, but it has a loud, cafeteria ambiance. I'd call it a dive, if it weren't for the unpleasant, bright, florescent lighting. Greeting was friendly, and we were seated quickly, but the table we were put at still had chunks of food over the tablecloth from a previous party. The buffet was illogically set up, so diners were dodging in and out of each other to get to food they wanted. The food was lukewarm or cold in parts, as if microwaved. Beyond that, it was just bland, bland, bland. The tray of nan stayed empty for most of the time that we were there. 

We paid on the way out instead of the way in. It would have been very easy to skip on the check entirely, despite a man sitting by the buffet, like a vulture. 

My mother won't be visiting again. I may try again some time in the future, but more likely, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch with my friends and after we sat down and looked at the menu we were like what! Yeah it's pricey.

It said buffet but there weren't any buffet ( we found out that they keep the buffet sign, so people will come in) tricky .....,,

We event more surprise when the food came out, it was in tiny pots with few in it. Really??? The flavor was good is just the amount of food and the price weren't match at all.
Sorry :("}
{"text":"Wonderful place!  Their buffet is well tended and has a nice variety.  I just wish that I still lived in the North Hills as there isn't anything in the South Hills that compares."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Amazing food! The owner, Gil, he's such a great person!! Always making sure everyone in the restaurant is enjoying their food. Which is amazing, by the way!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!

Let's be honest.  The name and the exterior appearance of Taj Mahal exude a cheesy vibe, no?  Shame on me for judging a book by its cover.  Under this roof is some tasty Indian food, but--here comes the disclaimer--I should note that my experience with Indian cuisine is limited.  If this is \"authentic,\" then I'm a fan of Indian food.  If this isn't the real deal, then I'm not sure I'm terribly interested in trying \"real\" Indian food at all!

The menu--extensive.
The food--flavorful and high-quality.
The portions--generous.
The price--reasonable.
The service--friendly...and slow.  Read on.

And the naan.  Ohhhh, the naan!  To die for.

Husband and I make it a point not to dine out if we're in a rush or a potential time crunch; I think it's rude to demand fast service at a non-fast-food restaurant.  Still, Taj Mahal gives a whole new meaning to the idea of a leisurely dining experience.  We actually chose to pay in cash and left a sizable tip so that we didn't have to wait for change or a credit card transaction.  Over 20 minutes must have passed from the time we confirmed we were ready for the check and when that check actually came, which prompted me to whisper to my guy, \"Babe, we can't ever come here if we're in a hurry...unless we're in a hurry for curry.\"  I know, I know.  Couldn't resist.

Can't wait to come back to try the lunch buffet, which is 10AM-3PM daily."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. Anyway, I thought the curry was a little...watery? Runny?? Couldn't quite put my finger on it but it wasn't the creamy, scrumptious curry I am used to. It beats most other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh but that doesn't say much. There's a lot to be desired. The naan was pretty good and my lassi was okay if a little thick for my liking. Not outstanding but not terrible either. (We did not do the buffet)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Taj Mahal about five times over the past couple years and have enjoyed all of my experiences there. The restaurant was renovated a year or two ago and looks a lot nicer post-renovation. Service has always been descent, and we've received our food relatively quickly. The menu is pretty extensive, but I've particularly enjoyed the Butter Naan and the Chicken Tikka Masala. They serve lunch buffet seven days/week and dinner buffet on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturday, which is a great way to try multiple Indian dishes. However, I recommend ordering an entree over the buffet based on the quality of the food. I hope to eat here again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine ever. Every time we're in Scottsdale I gotta go there. Everyone I've ever brought with me was skeptical at first but they loved it as soon as they tasted the delicious food! Give it a go you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I was here for dinner Saturday night. The atmosphere was perfect for Old Town Scottsdale. The servers were friendly and on point. But it got weird when the owner (Gil), who appeared visibly intoxicated, to interrupt my lovely evening alone. I appreciate owners to touch base with tables on occasions but he took that too far by pulling up a chair and mingling with (me) and other guests, and that's great, but a little too much. The food, however was excellent. The waiters were helpful, replenishing my drink and checking up on me. However, the waiters seemed on edge as the owner barked orders across the dining room loudly, enough to interrupt every guest in the restaurant, it was apparent he was a dictator of his establishment. Needless to say, it was very uncomfortable and unprofessional. The food is amazing, the service was great! Just disappointed in the manager's approach in running his business. May or may not return to Taj Mahal. I hope what I seen improves. As a former server, current restaurant manager in the industry, my sympathy goes out the employees."}
{"text":"This is one of those times where I wish that Yelp would let me give two separate ratings, one for the service and one for the food. Because they were in such stark contrast with one another that it's hard to decide how I feel about my experience overall.

Allow me to explain. Quite simply, the food here was spectacular. This just may very well be the best Indian I've had in the 'Burgh (and I don't say that lightly, as I've enjoyed a lot of good Indian food here). We had chicken tikka masala, matar paneer and garlic naan. The tikka was mouthwatering. The chicken was cooked perfectly and maintained its moisture (dry chicken tends to be the downfall of a lot of tikkas). The sauce was creamy and silky, with a hint of sweetness and spice...I'm drooling just remembering this sauce! The matar paneer was equally delectable, with generous amounts of cheese and peas swimming in a flavorful, rich sauce. The piece de resistance was the garlic naan, which was perfectly cooked...buttery, simultaneously crispy and chewy, and just the right amount of fresh garlic dotting the top. It was the perfect sauce-sopping mechanism.

So yeah, the food was outstanding. Now cue the sad trombone...because the service was pretty terrible. :(

From start to finish, wildly inattentive is the only way I can describe the service. We were seated right away, but it took about 10 minutes for someone to come by with waters and to take our order. A food runner did drop off our meals pretty quickly, so I guess that was the one bright spot. However, one of the dishes they brought out was wrong -- we had originally ordered matar aloo, and instead they brought us matar paneer. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen, and we will pretty much eat anything Indian, so we decided just to eat the matar paneer (which turned out to be tasty, but it's not cool that they screwed up our order). We normally get our food pretty spicy, but we went rather tame that evening (5), and thank goodness we did, because our waters were never refilled the entire time we were there. No one came by to take away our plates or bring our check. After our meal, we just sat and sat and sat, wondering if anyone was ever going to approach our table again.The restaurant wasn't that busy (plenty of empty tables). I saw the employees/owners chatting with what I assume are regulars instead of attending to other tables. Anyway, so after about 30 minutes of just sitting there with empty plates (yes, 30 minutes...I'm a patient person, but 30 minutes is the equivalent of about 10 years when you're sitting at a restaurant with empty plates waiting for your server to come back to your table), I finally had to grab the attention of a waiter when one walked by (and it was not ours) and ask if we could have our check. A few minutes later, our waiter finally reappears with our bill (this is the first time he'd come back to our table since he took our order!) He says we can pay up front and then mumbles \"sorry for the poor service.\"   Uhh...thanks, I guess?

So if I had to rate the food, I'd give it more than 5 stars. And if I had to rate the service, I'd dip into the negatives. So I guess I'll just split the difference and go with a 3 overall. 

Maybe someday I'll go back for take out, because the food really was super delicious, but I'm not sure about dining in again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had.

We went on a busy Saturday night before Christmas. We were seated quickly but our waiter didn't come by for a good 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, we helped ourselves to the fab buffet but I never saw a menu.

The variety and quantity of food was outstanding. Excellent Tandori chicken, lamb curry, and heavenly naan. My one food complaint is that the crispy bread was not out. :-( The food was all fresh and not over-baked-by buffet heat.

The restaurant was a bit loud but hey, it was Saturday night and the place was packed. Taj Mahal gets bonus points for the soft sound of Indian rock and roll music drifting out of the kitchen door. I like that they cook and listen to music.

Did I mention the wonderful naan?:-) Check out Taj Mahal, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Taj Mahal has a very good Indian buffet. First off, it has variety that other places can't even come close to. Seriously, you will be shocked by how many things the are that you actually want to eat. 

Here's what I remember from my last visit to the Thursday night dinner buffet: goat curry, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, palak paneer, vegetable korma, dal makhni, channa masala, sambar, chilli chicken, indo-chinese style noodles, broccoli Manchurian, eggplant, minced paneer with cashews, naan, chaat masala, samosa, fried spinach salad, gulab jamun, kheer, mango pudding, semolina pudding, chutneys... Like no joke! It's insane! (Typing that list with predictive text fighting me every step of the way was exhausting, by the way.) 

And not only do they have lots of food, it's all really good too. The old standbys like tikka masala and biryani are well-seasoned and nicely prepared, but I really like how they always feature some less-common dishes. For example, the paneer with cashew dish was totally new to me, and it was amazing. Super rich, as you might imagine, and almost meaty for the vegetarians out there. One time they had LAMB BIRYANI. On the buffet. That was a day to go down in history, it was so good. And I've never seen such good quality lamb on a buffet!

So, why not 5 stars? Well, a few reasons. Occasionally we have had pieces of chicken that just didn't taste right. Perhaps undercooked, or just a weird piece, but it has happened a couple of times. Mostly though, I'm deducting a star because Taj Mahal is just not a very comfortable place to dine. It's quite bright, even at dinner, when lower light or--dare I say it-- candles would be nice. The tables are extremely close together and can be wobbly. There are no booths and you feel very out-in-the-open wherever you sit. Generally the atmosphere doesn't lend itself to a nice, relaxing meal out, which is odd because it is decorated nicely and is going for a more upscale look. Now, this is no fault of the restaurant, but every single time I've eaten there, there has been at least one crying baby or screaming child. Every. Single. Time. While they can't banish the babies, it might help if they would open the back dining room when it's available to spread diners out more, or get some smaller tables so they can accommodate more patrons comfortably. 

While the dining room isn't the most comfortable place on earth, you can be sure that won't stop me from enjoying the plethora of delicious dishes at Taj Mahal!"}
{"text":"HORRID  FOOD ! 

I discovered this place through Groupon.  We went in around 11:30 am for the lunch buffet.  Sadly all I can say is, If you enjoy eating watered down, lukewarm, miss marked food and dishes which you have to dig to find a piece of meat or Chicken Tandoori which is as dry and charred as 10-year-old jerky!  Then this is the place for you!   Just make sure to clear your appointment schedule for the remainder of the day so you can spend time praying to the porcelain god because there's not enough Charmin toilet paper in the world for you after this experience! 

This new sub- par restaurant is new to the Valley and I am quite sure NOT going to be around after what we tasted today!  I am also contacting the Scottsdale Health Department in hopes they will save our community and expose this place on Dirty Dining!"}
{"text":"I have high expectations when it comes to Indian cuisine because I grew up on it... homemade.

I've been to this restaurant 3 times over the last 8 months. The first 2 times we all ordered the Masala dosai. From the first visit to the second there was a big difference in the dosa texture, color, thickness and flavor, the fillings and the sambher soup it comes with. Each person at the table ordered different levels of spiciness yet all of the dosa and soups were made the same level. Oh well, I still ate it and it was delicious. Dosa are large so I took home leftovers...it was even spicier than the day before. In my experience this is usually the case with Indian cuisine. 

On the third visit I was tempted to order another dosa to see what it would be like the 3rd time, but we arrived in time for the buffet. There were many choices and the room was packed! I enjoyed all the vegetarian options from chana masala and mattar paneer to malai kofta and dal. Plus they had amazing desserts...burfi! No one EVER has burfi! Of course I had the obligatory gulab jabun too!  

The service isn't the star at Taj Mahal...the food is. If you keep that in mind and enjoy the cuisine you will come away satisfied. We will be back!  Maybe for the buffet but probably for another dosa!"}
{"text":"This was the best Indian buffet that I've been to. I've passed this restaurant so many times being from Pittsburgh but never gave it a try. Now after one visit, coming back to my home in VA I miss it so much! Other Indian buffets that I've tried just don't compare. The size is larger and the taste is authentic. Service was great and servers were kind. Inside is not that large though. But still, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Always exciting to try a new restaurant, especially when it's Indian food. It's a quaint spot in Old Town and I walked in from the back entrance but they were cool about it. Easy parking in the public garage nearby. Bathroom was nice, I was surprised. They have a separate room for a bigger party which was cool.

I didn't order a drink but my water was refilled several times as needed which was nice. The table ordered a variety of dishes and most came in these silver bowls that were deceptive; they looked like they didn't fit much food but they sure packed it in there. I got the vegetable biryani, has never let me down yet and today was no exception. I ordered it hot but it had no heat so I got hot sauce on the side and BOY that was spicy. I took home my leftovers and I know it'll taste just as good as it does fresh. It had mushrooms in it which was pleasant. I also ordered a papadum appetizer and they tasted as they usually do except these were extra oily, not so great. 

Overall yum food with great service and the couple who owns the place were friendly and energetic, especially Gill the jokester. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options to satisfy all."}
{"text":"The food here was really amazing and why I'm giving 5 stars. Best chicken tikka masala I've ever had and the garlic naan is to die for. They also have a mango ice cream that is really delicious. Malbec on their wine list was really good and the owner/host is a bit loud but we found him entertaining and part of the experience. Food portions were a little small. They really need to modernize the receipt. Hand written and hard to understand"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service , GREAT FOOD !!! Very comforting and nice place , owner gave us mango lassi to try and as well as dessert! Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal provided incredible food at our wedding this August. I was planning a wedding remotely from San Francisco, and heard only good things about Taj. Usha was so kind during both our food tastings--she had us taste the food to our heart's content and was really committed to making our event special. She delivered a customized menu--for example I really wanted coconut water at the wedding, and she made it happen and even put little custom stickers on the coconuts. Usha also served mango lassi and kulfi at our outdoor wedding so the guests could keep cool. She made a pasta dish for the few people who don't eat Indian food, and also served cupcakes in addition to Indian sweets.

We were at a venue that had a tandoor, so all the food was made on-site and was very fresh. If you get a chance, try the tandoori shrimp, mini-lamb chop, and pani poori. My favorite part of the wedding were the various stations during cocktail hour. Taj provided a chaat station, dosa station, kabab station, and pain-puri station. Usher's staff were  professional and friendly, and the food was presented very nicely.

After the wedding, we did find out from the wedding planner that the cocktail hour food was delayed, but neither us nor our families noticed since we were enjoying our coconuts! The only logistical negative was that we didn't have an official contract and everything was done via email. So, it was a little difficult to communicate all the menu details/allergies/ingredient list etc. via email.

Overall we want to give a huge thanks to Usha and team for our beautiful wedding. Many guests told us this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding, and I have to agree!"}
{"text":"Great meal!   Been going to the Taj Mahal in Prescott for years, and finally had the chance to visit in Scottsdale.  Lamb Vindaloo was delicious, flavorful, spicy, and the lamb itself was excellent.  Sandra and Gil have always taken great care of me and my friends/family, and are incredible people, and involved/caring owners of this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I ate at the same place as all of the other reviewers or maybe I went on an off day (Was at the Buffet on Monday around 3:00) but the food here was just not great.

The chicken curry was decent, nice flavor but the chicken was a little dry.

The tandoori chicken again had good flavor but was extremely dry.

Goat curry was not bad.

I forget the name of the spicy chicken that was out but it was not spicy at all.

Both of the rices that were out were under cooked.

The Nann was super dry and very crunchy. We asked for fresh and they did bring a basket to the table so that was a plus.

The Gulab Jamun was also good.

Overall it was just decent, not great. The place was clean and the server/host was nice. The food could use some work. Maybe I will give it another try just to see if I was there at a bad time."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food while in the Phoenix area for Spring Training . A quick Yelp search landed me here. 

Located on a street with several other restaurants , bars and shop. Parking on both sides of the street can be tough depending on what time of day . I came on a weekend night and found a spot around the corner . 

Inside was clean, spacious and low lit which was nice. It was not a busy night so I was seated right away. 

Service was ok. Quick to give me the menu and take my drink order, however waited a decent amount of time to take my order. I was a little confused since it wasn't busy at all. 

Eventually my order was taken. I was debating on the tikka masala or the coconut chicken. I went with the chicken tikka masala which comes with rice. I also got a free order of garlic naan upon check in! 

Food arrived quickly and was so good ! Very filling and tasty. Great flavors! Price was decent too."}
{"text":"I dont normally write reviews, but i had to because this place is amazing! The quality of the food was insanely good. Everything tasted great and the ambience was very nice. Very friendly staff. Would definitely visit again even if i have to drive 7 hours just to enjoy an amazing meal"}
{"text":"I do love Indian food, however when I go there I tried order off the menu. I order off the menu and order to control the spiciness, some days the buffets really hot some days it's really mild. You do have to know their system of doing things in order to get in and out of there without a hitch. Like when you show up there's no place to stand but in the doorway and you have to tell them that you're there for them to find you a table. When you check out most the time you do not even have a bill, you just walk up to the gentleman at the cash register tell him what you ordered and that's it. They do offer a selection of alcohol and wine but you can also bring in your own bottle too. 
Definitely expect it to be very cramped and for the staff to assume that you're getting the buffet.
Al in all the food is good and so are the prices"}
{"text":"Best place in Prescott and now Arizona! So glad they opened in Scottsdale closer to our house. Best Indian food ever."}
{"text":"Great service excellent food.  Love it. We came in for my buddies birthday.  Fun place. Will come again"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The BEST Indian food I've ever had. The service is phenomenal.  The owner makes you feel like family. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to get Indian Food! I have tried many Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh but this is by far my favorite one! The buffet is awesome during lunch time and offers so many different things. Coming for dinner is always delicious as well. The mango chicken curry and lamb rogan josh are my favorites and the naan bread is always soooo good!"}

{"text":"Awesome food!  It's so great to have a legitimately good Indian food restaurant in old town.  Chicken Tikka Masala, vegetable korma, and saag paneer were all good."}
{"text":"This is the absolutely best Indian food I have had outside of London, ( I have not been to India). The staff is wonderful, accomodating, and friendly; the quality of food is superb. I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp since I was in the area. It's Ina great location in old town. Nice restaurant to walk into w a fairly large space. Have a full bar as well. Owner is friendly and was walking around talk to everyone and also taking orders.  
We ordered a few different items, chicken tikka masala, biriyani, tandoori chicken and naan per his recommendations. Unfortunately the food was not very good. The lassi was made well. The food portions were definitely on the smaller side especially for the price. It was also not spiced very well and did not feel very authentic. 
Will likely not return here for Indian food as there are better options in the Valley."}
{"text":"Fourth of July and I didn't feel like going to another barbeque. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for dogs, burgs, and the all american cook out food but I was looking for something different this year.  

I was scouring yelp for some inspiration and an open restaurant and finally stumbled upon this jewel. It was a bit far but hey, it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. I took my friends here who also shared my love of Indian food and they were impressed too.  Their dinner buffet was insane, probably one of the best I had ever had.  Compared to other Indian buffet's this one offered more sweets than the usual Indian buffet. The dishes were also unique as well as familiar. They served the palak paneer and chana masala as usual restaurants do but they also served yellow banana pepper curry and a curry with fried vegetable balls which still makes my mouth drool. I would have to say that this is my favorite buffet in the pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! I am not the kind of person who likes to try new foods outside of my comfort zone. But i had the Lamb Curry and it was very good. The meat was very tender not to chewy. My spice on a scale from 1-10 was a 5. Just perfect for those who do not like extremely hot foods. Great place atmosphere, small and personal. Friendly staff. I enjoyed my night out here."}
{"text":"I am a big Indian foodie and this is one of my top favorites! Nothing beats a good Tika and great service!!! We will definitely be back (weekly)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Service is top notch and the food is spectacular. I can't wait to come again and try this top notch traditional Indian cuisin. They do it right here."}
{"text":"Amazing North Indian Cuisine!  Staff was friendly and offered a half dish so I could try it.  Check out this hidden gem in Old Town!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Taj Mahal on a Saturday night for dinner per the suggestion of a Yelper from Pittsburgh and we were not disappointed. Taj Mahal was definitely the best Indian food that I have ever had.

The manager greeted us a few minutes after we sat down and asked us \"What do you like and are you vegetarian?\" before providing his suggestions. We followed all of his suggestions and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. 

For an appetizer, we had the non-Veg platter which was a platter of chicken strips, shrimp, a Samosa and lamb. The samosa (filled with meat and not just veggies like I am used to) was the best of the platter to me. I thought that this platter was good but could do without it next time.

For entrees, we had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Manager's Special: Shrimp in a yellow peanut and almond sauce. Both were delicious! I have had the Chicken Tikka Masala a hundred times and always found it to be too tomato sauce-y for me however this version was much more creamy and tasted similar to a curry. I loved it! I was a little skeptical about how exactly shrimp in a peanut and almond sauce would taste but it was soo good! I would order again and again. We also ordered a side of Garlic Naan that tasted great dipped in the sauces of our entrees.

Overall this Indian food was delicious and the beat meal that I had in Pittsburgh. Go with the Manager's suggestions and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. Great music and ambiance. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. My compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"At first I was reluctant in trying this place even though I had a Groupon. There were many negative reviews from Yelp. 
I tried and was pleasantly surprised by the quality in food and service. The service was great. I had the brother-in-law and Freddie who help with the menu. Food was tasty. The chicken was moist and delicious. 
Definitely a little on the expensive side but Groupon alleviate a bit. Will definitely return . 

Side note - You can't combine the Yelp check-in and Groupon."}
{"text":"Ordered many times from then on just eat. We always get the butter chicken and I believe the vindaloo. They're both delicious. The butter chicken is creamy but not too creamy and the vindaloo isn't too spicy but just the right amount of savoury. We usually order both along with garlic and cheese naan bread as well. Each curry comes with naan bread but the garlic one with it is yummy. Each curry comes with rice but we prefer to dip curry with naan bread :). I've had their raita yogurt and unfortunately it isn't as good as other places. I found it a bit too watery and not as much flavour."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Food in Arizona by far. The Chicken Tikka Masala was so good we had to order a second round. Gil the owner is an amazing guy and so much fun. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We visit Indian places all over the country and the Taj Mahal delivered a solid meal at a reasonable price (naan, appetizer, and two entrees for $30)! Our servers were friendly and treated us well; any issue with them would be nitpicking.

Garlic naan had a lot of butter (a plus). After asking for to-go boxes the one gentleman made sure we had chutney for the road."}
{"text":"There's a huge sign outside that they are open during renovations - and thank goodness they are! Even though the ambiance is a little muffled by construction - the food is delicious! My mom has never tried Indian food, and I have only had it a few times, but we both loved everything! It happened to be the Thursday buffet which was a great deal and we did BYOB. The naan here is so amazing! I love the flavors, the waitstaff were very friendly, and the experience was great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't like Indian food there is high chance this restaurant can change your mind.
Lunch buffet is foe 8.00 dollars weekday and some weekends you have to check with them for weekend buffet.
Some nights they have buffet too. Weekend night you have to order from menue.
Great food both for vegi and meat lovers don'n miss the nun (bread)."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and got a chicken dish that looked yellow, more like a malai kofta than a tikka masala sauce. I ordered medium/hot and there was so little spice in it that it tasted like nothing. I then had to go up to the bar to tell the waiter we didn't get our naan after waiting for 5+ minutes after the rest of the food came. I also told the waiter the chicken tasted very very mild and she took it back to add more spices and came back to say the chef would just remake it. Okay fine by me. While I was waiting for the remade chicken the naan came out and it was raw! Had to send that back as well and it came out raw around the edges a second time. She said they have a new naan chef, but you think they would make sure he isn't making raw naan before putting him in the kitchen to make customer's food. The remade chicken was slightly more spicy but still in no way a medium/hot or even remotely looking like the RED chicken tikka masala sauce it was supposed to be. 

After that whole ordeal I got the bill and I was charged for everything. I had to use a yelp coupon to get the naan taken off the bill. I have never had so many problems with my meal and not even been comped for the chai tea. My wife is Indian and I have eaten at plenty of great Indian restaurants and this is one of the worst experiences I have had at any Indian restaurant anywhere. The staff was friendly sure, but the food was horrible. We just moved here from New Jersey, where great Indian restaurants are aplenty. We will not be coming back to the Taj Mahal!"}
{"text":"Ok the ala-carte menu is awful. After reading reviews thought to try their buffet....super disappointing. The food was cold with lots of artificial coloring. The shrimp curry was watery and lacked any kind of flavor, felt like i was eating shrimp in water. Dont waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Really good food portions were kind of small and prices were kind of high.  But it's quality over quantity unless your starving. I don't think they have lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I came to this place several times and every time I come the food they bring taste and look like leftovers. Not coming back never ever again"}
{"text":"Although the server was very very forgetful, he was still nice enough.  The chicken Tika Masala was to die for.. the tamarind chutney was very good... and the Naan with meat cooked inside was amazing.  Will definitely come back next time I visit Scottsdale ."}
{"text":"First of all - Indian cuisine is my favourite cuisine, and I am very familiar with Indian food. 
After seeing all the great reviews I was \"tricked\" into this Indian restaurant. I have to say that all the staff was very friendly and nice. Even though they gave us dirty (oily) food menus. I had to wash my hands after I touched it.
- First of all, the restaurant is pretty small without any air circulation or fans. Many customers were ordering seekh kebabs that were brought on smoking plates, and the restaurant filled with white smoke and strong smell. I saw other people looking around for help (maybe someone could have opened the window). After almost ten minutes the smell was fading, and then another burning/smoking plate. This is where they lose 1 star.
- The waiter (older man, he was very nice) did not write down any of our orders/requests. I know usually it's a bad sign because we have special requests that many people forget even when they do write it down. And yes, he forgot about our order and special requests. 2nd star off.
- The food was so much below average. The onion naan (that was forgotten before, we received together with the bill) was very dry and I didn't like it. Rotti was extremely oily and looked unappetizing- we sent it away (many restaurants don't put any butter on top of rotti). Also Saag Paneer was very oily, even though it was flavourful. I ordered a side of cucumbers and they brought me something that looked like rubbish. It was almost grey colour, soft and looked like it was frozen before. I still tasted it and it was very bitter. I also sent it away. So, 3rd star off.
- Also their washrooms were really filthy, dusty, spider webs, very unpleasant. So then I started thinking - what's in their kitchen...!? I was reading other reviews where a customer saw them putting leftover dips back into the large containers, instead of throwing away. I actually believe this is something they would do seeing how dirty their washrooms are.
- This is definitely a place I will not return."}
{"text":"I have eaten here dozens of times but always their terrific buffet.  It's pretty heavy from dish to dish but overall very nicely seasoned and there is a terrific assortment of vegetarian, meat and dessert offerings.  I always have a really hard time deciding what to eat and never have enough room.  It's a really good problem to have.  I really like their new remodel and the service for the buffet is ok.  I would give them 4 stars but I had a really bad dinner there last night.  I, like others who have reviewed this place, had a poor dining experience when ordering from their ridiculously large menu.  

To tell you the story of last night's dinner would just take me too long.  The vegetarian thali is listed incorrectly on the menu causing great confusion.  The food wasn't very good and the service was worse.  The place was packed on a Sunday night and they weren't handling it very well.  Why not just serve the buffet if you can't deliver on a menu table service?  There were certainly enough people there to support it.  

They serve papad when you sit down with the standard trio of condiments.  You aren't supposed to take these from table to table.  They were a mess and had definitely been at someone else's table before they brought them to ours.  

I am so beleaguered by last nights meal that I don't have the energy to expound on this review.  Just stick to the buffet and stay away otherwise is my counsel to you."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. The owner came to chat with us and they were accommodating with our requests. We will definitely be back here next time we visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Refused to seat us because we have young children. Went down the street to another restaurant, Gandhi where the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great indian food, one dish had a bit too many bell peppers. Other than that this is five star all the way."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, it certainly cured the craving I was having for some good Indian food.  I loved the wide variety of dishes (curry goat, chicken vindaloo, & chicken tikka) they had on the buffet (some of my favorites along with one's I've never had before). One item I tried was a kale type salad with red onion & I'm not sure what else was in it, the kale in the salad was fried and reminded me of kale chips. I'm not a vegetarian but I liked the many options they had, they were very tasty.  I will stop here again."}
{"text":"Great location. Downtown Scottsdale. Parking can be an issue depending on the time of day when you go. There is public parking behind the restaurant.  Enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala. Good rice and great Nan!  Great service and it has a great bar."}
{"text":"Best Indian food restaurant in the city.  The breads, sauces, and entrees extremely fresh, appropriately spicy, and delicious.  Reasonable prices as well.  Yinz won't be disappointed ;-)"}
{"text":"This review is long overdo. So long in-fact, that when I first started coming to Taj Mahal's Prescott location over 10 years ago the the first iPhone hadn't even been released. Just let that sink in. When I moved to the Valley a few years ago, I tried to find delicious Indian food near my house. I have probably tried over 10 different restaurants. Nothing cures my craving for Chicken Tikka Marsala like Taj Mahal. 
I am so glad that they opened up a location in Old Town. The Valley needed a healthy dose of delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Food is good, lunch buffet is only $9.99 on weekdays and $11.99 on the weekend. Water is not unlimited lol as they don't come often to fill it up. Eating there for about half an hour, my cloth has smell of the food attached. Good smell though"}
{"text":"This buffet is by far the beat Indian restaurant in the city. Best Indian restaurant in the state as far as I am concerned. I have never been to a place where literally every bite of food I get has nice flavor and smell to it. Lunch buffet will not disappoint you definitely get your money's worth. All these people leaving 3 or 2 or 1 star reviews are just picky people. Or people that compete with their business. Anyone calling this place dirty or un flavorful can square up on sight."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food in pittsburgh and surrounding areas! The lunch buffet is full of fresh delicious food with all of the vibrant tastes and colors of India!"}
{"text":"Flavorful and authentic dishes. Cool atmosphere too! Had the garlic naan, roti, chicken bhuna and chana sag. Will be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"A good Indian restaurant with a $12 buffet. My favorite dishes in the buffet were the chickpea salad and a chickpea masala. I think it's a good place to stop for food after shopping at Ross Park Mall."}
{"text":"I love those mango lassi drinks, but I know not to order one before my meal, as the drink is a meal in itself, at least for me. However, Mark H. was along and ordered one and then was freely sharing it. Yep, I was licking the cup before our food arrived, at least I didn't order it AND I didn't drink the whole lassi! 

Garlic naan is a must-have. The bullet naan is a welcome change, but I definitely preferred the garlic.

The lentil dish had quite the spice kick to it, ordered medium. It paired nicely with the naan.

Lamb vindaloo had great flavor and at the medium spice level was a little lower on the spice scale from others that I've had. Tasted great though.

Butter chicken was the surprise for me. Very flavorful. I had seconds on that, or maybe even thirds. 

The vegetable korma was the fourth dish. Perfect pairing to the butter chicken.

The staff was excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. No room for dessert sadly, but I did have that mango lassi!"}
{"text":"It was a slow day at work and one of my coworkers had to swing by the mall; I figured tagging along would be a good excuse to hit up Taj Mahal's lunch buffet.

It's a bit out of the way if you live/work in Pittsburgh proper, but this buffet is cheap and worth the drive. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and the buffet featured a variety of salad, appetizers, vegetarian dishes, meat dishes, curries, and desserts (any meal that I can end with some gulab jamun is a meal worth writing a good review about).

There's a good reason this place was on the City Paper's best of list--the grub at the buffet is unrivaled."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at the Taj and we will most certainly going back!
We ordered the Punjabi Goat Curry, Tandori mixed grill, garlic naan and the Saag Paneer.
All were outstanding but the garlic naan and the tandori lamb was top of our list!
After eating curry all over the valley, just one visit the Taj is going to become our Friday night local.
We are originally from London so we know good curry when we find it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got takeout from Taj Mahal on McKnight Road this past weekend.  We got two orders of Lamb Saagwala.  The food was good, however the portions were very small.  We paid a total of $27 after tax and were both still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm from South Africa and aside from India we probably have the best Indian food. Have been disappointed by so many Indian places since I've been in America,but Taj Mahal exceeded every expectation. Had the chicken korma and lamb vindaloo. Have it hot. Both were excellent and I'll highly recommend it. Staff's friendly and service is fast. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! Toasty nan. Delicious options for vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters."}
{"text":"We have tried several Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. This buffet and everything we have ever ordered off the menu is by far the best!!

In addition to fantastic fresh food, the service is always delightfully friendly. 

Never want to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Food was really good! The wait was long but they were busy. It was really loud in there."}
{"text":"Went here because of the positive reviews. We had a bad experience. Got seated right away, took 15 minutes to get a water and another 10 for a beer, food took 30 more minutes, lamb was tough, no table service during main course and another wait for the check which came with out an itemized copy! 

Save yourselves 100 dollars and a frustrating meal."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant after seeing it numerous times on my way to the mall and then reading about it in Pittsburgh Magazine. The food was good, but i wish it had been hot (temp wise). It tasted like it had been microwaved and not all the way through since it was cold in some areas. 

The man who seemed to be the owner never seemed to leave his perch on a raised area behind the cash register. He was always yelling at the help and eyeballing all the customers the entire time we were there. 

The overall experience was not good. Luckily the food tasted okay. I may get my family to try Indian food again no thanks to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I called for takeout and expressed the need to eat gluten free.  After walking though all of the vegetarian meals that were gluten free with me and realizing I had my heart set on the Malai Kofta, he asked if I could give him a little extra time and he'd it gluten free.  

Picked up my DELICIOUS meal -- had the paneer pakora as well.  Both were incredible!  And I was impressed at the time taken to cater to my diet needs."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous, the service was excellent and personalized. Melt in your mouth chicken masala and saag paneer. Will be back often to this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Indian food but always get nervous about the quality on buffets. This is the absolute best buffet of any kind we have ever been to. The selection is large and quality is what you would expect to get in a high end Indian dinner."}
{"text":"The portions are incredibly small (my husband and I both ordered $17 chicken dishes and got a total of one chicken breast combined. We had a $65 tab and left hungry. Literally like 3 bites of chicken total per dish and the rest was sauce.) Not kid friendly- We got there at 630 pm and didn't get served our meal until 8 PM. I should also mention there was soft porn playing on the TV too. Other than that, the food was good. Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Fab. U. Los.

Excellent naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb boti kabob, carrot pudding and owner Gill is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Generous with wine. 

I had never gone out for Indian food and Gill helped me pick out some of the best food I've had. Will be back."}
{"text":"Loved it here! Recommended by some friends on the north side. This place has a weekend buffet from 7-9 and it is very busy!!

We went here one Saturday afternoon. We thought they'd have a buffet but they didn't so we decided not to go there but while in the parking lot changed our mind and went back inside. 

After looking over the menu we chose the non-vegetarian platter and chicken vindaloo which was plenty for two to share. The platter came with so much food it was enough to make two meals. *check picture* 

I don't remember everything that was on it but it all tasted great!! It was hot, fresh and delicious. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating convincing my husband to buy two beers instead of sticking to water. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an Indian lover."}
{"text":"I love the decor inside the plane and the owner was incredibly friendly, I just wasn't too impressed with the food. I will go back to give it one more try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Had take out from here a few times and came in person twice now. I always order the chicken tikka masala and maybe the mattar bharta, aloo ghobi, bhindi masala or the dahl. Have not been disappointed so far! The dishes are tasty, the tikka masala sauce is nice and creamy. The owners are very friendly and the service is always good. My go to place for Indian food from now on!"}
{"text":"We are lucky to have this Indian food spot here in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. Its truly a treat to have delicious and authentic food! Being British I've grown up with Indian cooking and love to treat myself to a meal here trying different curries and interesting dishes on the buffet. The chicken tikka masala is a classic dish & Taj Mahal's version is truly delicious creamy and flavorful. My parents will even make the treak out from Greensburg to join me - and they know a good Indian spot! I would recommend trying the buffet and tasting a bit of everything!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food. I discovered it about a month ago and have cravings for it almost everyday.  Try the lamb bhuna and the chicken tikka masala.  Both are excellent.  Their naan bread is the best I've had. 

The owner is a real character. Nice man who genuinely cares about his customers having a wonderful meal and experience.  

I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"We loved Taj Mahal! We tried the garlic naan and Coconut Chicken. The workers were so kind and it's a nice open atmosphere! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best authentic Indian cuisine I have ever eaten. The waiters are excellent are recommending dishes for your specific taste. They have wonderful appetizers. I recommend getting garlic naan with your dish. My family comes here frequently and always have a wonderful time. The owner is very kind and generous and appreciates his customers."}
{"text":"Love their buffet! All the food is really excellent. Big fan of the naan, spinach, potato, and chickpea dishes. (Yes common ingredients in a variety of dishes, but any combination always tastes really good!) The rice is a delicious compliment to all of the above. Lots of options for vegetarians and meat eaters. If you have a tree-nut allergy I'd probably steer clear as some of the dishes have creamed tree nuts (cashew) in them."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here, I am addicted to this food. The food here is so delicious and the menu has so many options everyone will be pleased. The service is superb, family owned and truly authentic. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family since it is a one of a kind experience."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Pittsburgh--Indian, American, WHATEVER. Go for the buffet stay for the full stomach. Delicious desert, vegetarian food, EVERYTHING. Best Indian food I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Despite all of the Indian restaurants in the Shadyside / Oakland area, the PIC and I have made the trek to McKnight Road on numerous occasions to partake of Taj Mahal.  The buffet has the best variety of foods for your money amongst the Indian buffets I have been to and on nights when you have to order off of the menu, the prices are decent and there are many options to choose from.  I'd say if you find yourself on McKnight, do yourself a favor and give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Little costly for Indian restaurant. Owner talks too much.. some times that is irritating. Been here two times, owner shared same jokes evey time."}
{"text":"My first Taj Mahal experience was in their Prescott location. Glad that they were able to make it out to Scottsdale! Hope that the community is able to branch out and give Indian cuisine a try! The Scottsdale location is spacious, clean, and comfortable. There's a nice vibe to it. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the flashing bar lights - a little too distracting for me. 

My SO and I have been to this location a handful of times and have really enjoyed each time. Food is always satisfying and service is always accommodating. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options - not uncommon in this cuisine, but always great to note for first timers. This past time, we started with the vegetable samosa. Yummy as always! For the main courses, we had the saag paneer, pakora masala, and the aloo chole. We had a friend with us that never had Indian before and she wholeheartedly thought that everything was delicious.

We used a Groupon this night - definitely a great deal!Just know that the fine print indicates one Groupon per table only."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly owner, and good ambience - a good spot for Indian food in old town. Good place for a date or groups of people."}
{"text":"I've always been here for the buffet. It's a pretty reasonable place considering the spread. Right to the point: 

What I love about the buffet are sweet dishes, they always seem to work for me. The starters are good too, be it the pakodas (batter fried veggies), dahi vada and few other things. 

Vegetarian options are way better here. I prefer to always go for Chole Masala and veg curries. 

However, I am not a big fan of their main course. The food always felt a bit insipid compared to other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh area. 

Still, this place is a welcome break for those who dig Indian food and visit other places a lot."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh and by far the best I have ever had (San Antonio restaurants take notice!). The buffet is so varied; you have many choices and can't go wrong with any of them. The renovation of the restaurant went really well; the places looks so clean and updated. Well done."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Taj Mahal Restaurant, before and after its renovation. The service is always exceptional and the food is amazing. I usually go to the Thursday night dinner buffet but I can also be found there any day that the buffet is open. The food is always fresh and they refill the food very frequently. So if there is not something that is there on your first pass through it is usually filled by the second time you go up. 

I enjoy the pakora fritters the best. I just love dipping them in the yogurt, mint, and that sweet brown sauce. Then I head to the Chicken Tikka Masala and Goat Curry, spicy and so flavorful. And the one thing that I go up for over and over again, the Palak Paneer. Creamy spinach with cheese cubes cooked in it. I was always put off by this dish because it looks so green and chunky, but one day I braved my fear of it and got some. I have never looked back. This is amazing and so good AND good for you! Spinach is amazing. And their dish is not to be missed."}
{"text":"One of the few bright spots in the culinary wasteland known as the North Hills.  Buffets gross me out, but their lunch buffet is the exception.  For dinner, go with a group and order family style...you're bound to get 1-2 killer dishes."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is high quality ingredients and absolutely delicious. My husband and I are very excited to have a quality Indian restaurant in the area and plan on being here a lot. Owner is also very kind and attentive to your needs. I appreciate when the chef/owner comes out to ask how your food is. If your a true foodie, this place is up your alley!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, the staff is super welcoming and sweet.  Atmosphere is quiet so you can have great conversation.  We had tika masala and saag panneer, very authentic Indian food.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always love their location in Prescott and were so excited to hear they opened one one in the valley. This location is just as good, but maybe even better because it's so close. They have a large section of vegan and vegetarian dishes here, all of which are some of the most incredible Indian dishes I've ever had. The owner and staff is knowledgeable about the food which is important because we have some dietary restrictions. They are also happy to make a custom dish if we ask for something to be added/ removed. We have never had a poor experience with this restaurant and will continue to go to both locations for some great Indian food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with friends and ordered an appetizer plus four small dishes to share.  The appetizer, Ghobi Manchurian was meh, as it tasted like tempura + air.  The dishes, Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Saag, and two veggie Saag Mattar Bhartha / Sage Paneer were all delicious.  Regular Naan was served - nothing special, yet perfect for dipping.  The service was great and when we asked to meet the owner he was extremely charismatic and informative.  He shared the Indian ice cream for dessert, also delicious and a terrific palette cleanser.  The only foreseeable issue with this place is you don't realize how full you are getting sharing yummy small plates and we felt like we needed to walk a few miles before going home to bed!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Go to this place if you want to leave hungry. The buffet might be good, but never ever order from the menu here. 

We reached this place at 7. They gave us a plate of broken pappadums. It seems like they gave leftovers from a previous order. Seriously, if they are making fresh papas, then its not going to break on its own from the kitchen to the table. Either, they purposefully broke a plate of pappadums or they reheated leftovers.

They didn't come to get our order until 7:20. No one came. In fact, I had to wave at the only waitress to get her attention. My daughter had stuffed herself on papad by then. My son doesn't like papad, and he was steaming. So, we ordered an app, a rice and dal for the kids,  a naan and a curry. 

The app came in 5 mins. It was 7:40 and the food hasn't arrived yet. My daughter was tired already, so I took her out, leaving my wife and son. If the curry was taking time, the least they could have done was get the dal for the kids. We suspect that they forgot about us.

My wife started complaining and they said that they had a huge party right before us, and the chef went on an extended break before our order. I had noticed the \"chef\" earlier. The \"chef\" is an old Indian auntie who can barely walk straight. I wonder how she can run a kitchen. Poor lady has to take a breather after a big party, which means everyone who follows goes hungry. 

The \"chef\" might be a good cook, but she is not a chef. This place should hire a professional. The entire front of the restaurant is run by one waitress and busboy. They need more people to run a restaurant with 20 tables. At least hire more people on the Jul 4th weekend. The uncle who manages the front does nothing to help. He just shows up when its time to collect the money."}
{"text":"This is our go to Indian place in Old Town. Close to everything. Great ambiance, drink menu, and ambiance! Very friendly staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"When we visit Pittsburgh, this is a favorite. A huge menu, sure to please anyone familiar with Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill in a bad way. I use to love this place from the moment it opened. My family has been long time patrons. But not anymore! The SERVICE IS AWFUL!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go there, it's packed with Indian people so it must be good, right?  I dunno.  I've only been there for the lunch buffet and I find the food to be a bit stale and looking like large-scale food production.  If you're looking for an Indian buffet, I would recommmend Mintt."}
{"text":"After a pretty good takeout experience I was looking forward to sit down and eat at the place. We got there Friday around 5:30. Although there were a grand total of two other occupied tables we sat for a while with no menus, water, etc.  After 15-20min we finally got water and ordered. The place starts seating some more tables while we wait for our food. I checked the time and realized we'd been sitting there for over an hour. I look around and notice pretty much all of the tables that came in after us have their entrees. We decide to leave.  Horrible service. We'll stick with Tamarind for North Hills Indian eats."}
{"text":"The food was OK. The service was slow. Nothing against the people but they are severely under staffed and need to hire more people.

I left hungry and unsatisfied with the food. I will never return for dinner here. I have heard good things about their buffer so maybe will try that but never returning for dinner here"}
{"text":"Solidly good food. Nice staff, and I love the ease of online ordering."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, we ordered the Tandoori Wings and the garlic and onion naan, but it is the service that was superb. They really make you feel welcomed like you are part of the family. It is also a great location."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.   The best Indian food that my wife and I have had in a long time.  The service was good and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food and even better staff! A well rounded experience that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. The vegetable koroma has lots of vegetables and the raisins add a touch of sweetness and the almonds add a nice texture to dish. The naan comes out piping hot and so yummy. Make sure to try their chai tea! They brew the tea to order so it does take a few moments."}
{"text":"Amazing buffet with tons of great dishes. Friendly and accommodating so staff. Great dining experience? all the way around!"}
{"text":"Oh man, if you love Indian food you gotta try their buffet! And even if you don't like Indian food, you might like it after you eat here. I'm no expert on Indian cuisine, but I like everything on their buffet. There is a huge variety of dishes to choose from and also vegetarian and gluten free options. Their naan bread is delish, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, goat curry, Palak paneer, dal, plus desserts like mango pudding. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OMG amazing! I was pleasantly surprised to see a dinner buffet. And it was delicious! Tons of variety, everything was fresh - I was in flavor heaven! I've never had Indian this good in Atlanta where I am from. Chicken tikka masala, chili chicken, saag paneer, cauliflower, chickpeas, meatball korma, tandoori! I had two plates full and believe me, I wanted more but I was stuffed! No rice pudding though, which is what I like to finish off Indian food with, but that's ok. They had these deep fried milk balls covered in honey. 

OK so the service was a little curt, but I'll still give y'all 5 stars because the food was just that bomb."}
{"text":"Lots of varieties were there for Sunday buffet.  However the spice level was a bit on the lower side for my taste buds. Chicken items were good , however goat curry was poor.  Loved their sweets and savouries. Kachodi, pav bhaji and jilebi were top class."}
{"text":"Very flavorful, just the right amount of heat.
A great meal, I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went into Taj Mahal after looking at all the reviews on Yelp and admittedly, my expectations were pretty high. The owner at this place is a little overbearing -- when we told him what we'd like to order, he simply kept saying we should get the Paneer Masala instead (despite us mentioning that we didn't want that item on the menu). My friend who'd joined me for dinner gave up and ordered the Paneer so he's stop trying to convince us. 

After ordering our entrees, we were made for wait for about 45 minutes although the waiter and the owner were being apologetic about that during our wait and when our food finally arrived they got in the WRONG items -- Chicken Tikka Masala instead of the Paneer he was ever so enthusiastic about making us order. My friend who's vegetarian totally lost her appetite  although they brought in our right orders later. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Their lunch and dinner buffet does not disappoint.  They have options for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores.   

It can get really crowded and noisy during dinner time on buffet days."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Taj Mahal for a decade. How is that possible, you ask? They started out in Prescott with their first location and now I'm eating at the Scottsdale digs for the first time. It tastes amazing! Garlic Naan and Chicken Tikka Masala are a must! Don't think. Just come out here!! Also, drink a Taj Mahal beer."}
{"text":"I have spent my adult life enjoying Indian food. Every time I visit a new city or country, I am always on the lookout for great-tasting Indian food. Sometimes that great Indian flavor can be found in your own backyard.

The Taj Mahal has a nicely diversified menu that does not overwhelm you but has a well-balanced variety of dishes from which to choose.

When we were there the waitstaff were very attentive and helped make the meal memorable. Water was filled regularly and requests for more to drink were asked at the perfect time.

The food was scrumptious. We ordered four dishes and naan for four people. Two were vegetable and two were meat. A nice balance. We ordered all the dishes  to be medium on the spicy scale. A good choice as everyone was happy. I asked for extra hot sauce so I could make the lamb vindaloo a little hotter.

The bullet naan we ordered was an interesting change from garlic naan.

The whole experience was delightful and I heartily recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Outstanding Indian food!!! GORGEOUS, well stocked bar.  Lots of delicious vegan options.  I've tried 3 of them so far. WOW!! The best Indian food in the valley!! 
There are also lots of vegetarian options. And of course non veg dishes on the menu. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Nice service, even if a bit slow at times. Good food and good ratio quality-price. I would recommend the peshwari naan to anyone"}
{"text":"Great service and amaaaazing food! Their wings are so unique and so good! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had, possibly ever. If ya can't handle spicy, ask for no spice at all. But if ya can handle spicy, this place will challenge you. Ingredients are high quality, and really tasty. The dining room has a really good vibe, and the drinks aren't too steep in price. If ya get a chance, strike up a conversation with the owner. He and his staff are very friendly, and you can really tell he cares about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Indian food and I love their buffet.  The food is quality and it allows you to experiment with many types of indian dishes.  I've been to other Indian restaurant buffets, and the selection of choices here seems to be very large in comparison."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised to find a huge buffet.  The food was hot and tasty and fresh.  They even had curry goat and chicken, among many vegetarian options.  Well done Taj Mahal.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My hubby swears by this place. He absolutely loves it. I wish I could eat spicier things but, alas, I cannot. The buffet is wonderful though and the smells of the spices filling the air...smells amazing!"}
{"text":"I noticed this restaurant by the way the building looks like from the outside. So I told my friends about it and we have it a try. We came in on a Sunday. It was very good. One of the restaurant employees helped us get the most delicious  cultural meals. Soooo delicious! Nice and spicy! The style was like eating in a palace. Prices were like in a palace too. But common people, when you go to a restaurant in downtown Scottsdale you expect a $10.00 dinner? You know what your going for. So when people write reviews about cost at a prestige restaurant it looks silly."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet.  All of the dishes were simply delicious; especially the deserts.  The service was solid and the restaurant was very clean.  Also, employees were very friendly.  I'm so looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I'm no Indian food expert but this is by far the best I've ever had. The flavors are bold and I've never buy into a \"questionable\" price of meat in any dish here like happens at so many Indian places."}
{"text":"We had a work holiday lunch here on a Friday and the food was amazing. Everyone was smitten. Gluten free everything and vegan too. Also the best tandoori chicken for us carnivores. The owner is hilarious and warm. The staff just want to please. The atmosphere is modern but with authentic Indian touches. Full bar. Great tea. I can't say enough. I feel bad for people that never experience this hell of a gem."}
{"text":"Came in at 257 pm on a Tuesday afternoon and although buffet ended at 3 pm, the server was cool with us doing buffet which was a huge bonus. Living in Iowa and having limited Indian food options, the variety was amazing here, especially the meat dishes.  There is no way you can try everything and our eyes were bigger then our stomachs because we over ate but everything we had was delicious. The server also brought us fresh naan which went so well with the butter chicken.
Honestly, the gulab jaman (dessert) was the cherry on the cake, a great ending to a fantastic meal.
I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great, great Indian food and service - full bar. This restaurant is very clean & a very nice decor. It's the best Indian I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped at this little hole in the wall during Christmas vacation. It was quiet and nice inside, and the food was delicious. The staff was very accommodating and helpful!"}
{"text":"We ended up here when the Indian restaurants close to I-76 were both closed on Monday and the Indian craving had already been triggered. This was a bit out of our way but we ended up enjoying the detour and felt it was worth it for the awesome food we found here.

The restaurant had a lot of people but staff was quick to seat us, provide us with water, and clear plates.  Food on the lunch buffet was delicious!  Some highlights were the fish curry (salmon), chicken tikka masala (so moist), zucchini with lentils (with the vegan options), and the best vegetable korma I have ever tried.  Not sure if we are just used to MD prices but 3 adults and 1 child for around $34 is a great deal.  

Might have to take another detour for lunch on our next trip to the mid-west ."}
{"text":"From the outside, I wasn't expecting much but the food, served buffet style, was really good.  You can also order off of a menu if you don't want the buffet.   This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"As an appetizer, I got the Vegetarian Platter: Onion Bhaji, Veggie Pakora, & 2 Vegetable Samosas - $12.  I really enjoyed the Onion Bhaji & Veggie Pakora; both were perfectly seasoned and delicious. The Vegetable Samosas were good, but I wasn't a fan of their tamarind sauce, at all. It was way too tart and had no hint of the sweetness that I like in my tamarind sauces.  

My main entree was the vegan Aloo Saag -$14, which I ordered spicy/hot.  It was ok, but it was too dry and it had zero spice.  I have had delicious vegan Aloo Saag at other restaurants, so they cannot use the excuse that the lack of cream is the culprit. I have no idea where the spice went, but none of it went into my dish.  I was very disappointed, and it was certainly not worth $14.

I was told that the only vegan bread options were the roti and the Aloo Pratha. I don't like roti so I got the Aloo Pratha -$5.  The bread was hard (too difficult to cut) and not tasty. 

My lunchmate had the non-vegan Aloo Saag and some naan. She stated that her naan was also hard and she was not happy with her Aloo Saag either. 


I had issues with their cleanliness. When we arrived at the dinner opening time, we were the first ones there.  The benches had not been cleaned or wiped down from the lunch crowd (which was about 3 hours earlier). I had to ask the waiter to wipe the seats. Also, there was some sort of food in my water glass. I had to ask for a new glass. Lastly, I saw a guy get hired immediately after about a 2 minute interview, which was cool. It was not cool to see him immediately start waiting tables and he was holding one tables' water glasses against his shirt! I think the manager said something because the new guy then placed the already tainted glasses on a tray. 

The prices were too high for the quality (of food & service) and amount of food that you get. It is unlikely that I will re-visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a pick up order of 2 butter chickens, 2 order of garlic naan, and 2 orders of rice. It is a typical meal and since our favorite Indian place was closed, we decided to try Taj Mahal based on the yelp reviews. I was pretty disappointed and felt kinda ripped off.

First for the price ($50) you get 1 Chinese take out box of rice, 2 small plastic containers of butter chicken (more butter sauce than chicken womp, womp) and 2 pieces of garlic naan. The naan is pre cut for you into triangles. We got 4 triangles per person...so...hmm....2 pieces of naan cut into fourths? Was that really 2 separate orders? Stop cutting the naan please.

The naan had no garlic and not cilantro...was just plain. We live pretty far from this place so we just ate what we had. 

The flavor was good. Spice was good. Chicken was a little dry and chewy. 

I wouldn't have minded the price if the portion had been right. Just feels like you pay for the atmosphere and to be in Scottsdale. The staff is very sweet. Very attentive. 

All in all, meh."}
{"text":"I don't even know why people go anywhere else for Indian food when Taj Mahal exists.  As an obnoxious vegan, it helps TREMENDOUSLY when their dishes are labeled as vegan.  

Super flavorful, always fresh tasting, and new Indian food-goers shouldn't shy away from the lunch buffet.  They make all the foods relatively mild in spice so it's not offensive to the standard white person in the area.  

I happen to love spice and wish the food during lunch was spicier, but they have to cater to the majority during lunch.  

Staff is always great, prices are fantastic and the food is tremendous.  

Come here.  Wear your most comfortable stretchy pants and eat everything."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!! When I enter the aroma of the food is just happy. The buffet is so yummy- I've tried everything and liked everything. I love the vegetable masala, the palak paneer, and especially the mango pudding. My boyfriend loved the goat curry.  The newly decorated room is beautiful and warm in both temperature and ambiance."}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot. Coming from Birmingham UK I'm partial to some Good Indian food. This was awesome. To top it the manager/owner came by to greet us with his personal touch. Food was excellent. Chicken tikka masala with basmati and a garlic naan. Place is nice and new inside, bathrooms super clean and well kept. I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal is my favorite Pittsburgh spot for Indian. Going on a day they offer the buffet serves as a great opportunity to try all kinds of dishes without committing to a full entree. The food is delicious and, while I'm not an expert, the recipes seem very authentic. Their chicken tikka masala is my favorite and, of course, you have to have some naan - it's worth trying the naan basket which offers several varieties.

I would definitely give Taj Mahal five stars based on the quality and taste of their food. However, I have had minor issues in the past with their basic customer service. They offer online ordering which is a nice convenience, but I have gone to pick up only to find they hadn't started my order or that my order would take significantly longer than I was told (one time waiting an additional 25 minutes in the restaurant). There have also been issues dining in - we once had a large party and there was a lot of confusion over paying the bills. I would not mention these if they were one-time issues, but these things seem to keep happening.

Honestly, these issues haven't stopped me from returning frequently to Taj Mahal. I'd like to see improvements with their customer service, but there is likely no incentive for them to improve since they are always very busy with lots of patrons. I'm not trying to knock them down; like I said, the food is wonderful. Definitely check them out for some fantastic tastes of India, but be aware you may hit a few bumps in your dining experience on the service side of things."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this sooner. It's truly a gem of the north hills. Growing up with a family friend from India I know good Indian food! He has since passed but my love for the food has not. This is the only place I found that even comes close to his cooking. It's flavorful delightful the bread is incredible and you can't go wrong. The buffet is a steal of a price and if you try it you won't be disappointed I can assure you of that! The chicken tikka and the chicken byrani are my favorite chicken dishes. Also if you are looking for veggie try the cashew sauce veggies I can't think of the name but they rock. Not to mention the veggie pakora!! If you are on the fence just go and eat to your hearts desire. Also the gulab little sugar donuts are great too!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Indian food. I have never eaten in at the restaurant - only gotten takeout. It seems busy every time I go to pick up my food and they do have a full bar, although it's usually empty and doesn't seem like the kind of place you go to and sit at the bar to eat or drink. But their food is so good and the portions are large. I recommend the palek paneer with a side of naan! Always at least a meal of two worth of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today after driving past a million times.  The Taj is LEGIT.  Had Tandoori for the first time in a while and it was fantastic.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is great and the customer service was exceptional. Shout out to Freddy, who made sure everything was made to order. The staff was also providing a welcoming atmosphere throughout the meal. Definately going back again."}
{"text":"Walking into the door you've transported from downtown Scottsdale to India. The aroma of the delightful spices fill the air once you walk into the door. The restaurant is all hand crafted flamed wood and industrial look bar with some modern flare and India influence. Very impressive for a table for two or a large party . I asked if they cater large parties since the decor of the restaurant is so beautiful. They do. The menu was traditional Indian cuisine a large menu. I ordered the appetizer sampler , saag panneer , and panneer masala. You can taste the difference of the freshness amazing full spice delicious. I'm so impressed that I've found by far the best authentic Indian restaurant in Scottsdale , Arizona . Wow !"}
{"text":"I love the Taj. I love it so much I have requested this for my birthday lunch locale! I crave their lunch buffet. I dream about it. I wake up at night wanting it. 

For $9 you can't beat the amount of meat and vegetarian choices on the buffet. Tons of sides, desserts, and salad items as well. I nearly explode when I leave!

One night I even did some online ordering and it was ready at the exact time I requested. I was a bit skeptical about ordering online  but my order of samosas, vegetable korma, and butter naan was perfect!"}
{"text":"Fell on this place by accident, amazing accident...! Great food, great service, im sure to come back"}
{"text":"We have been to many Indian Restaurants in many cities, but I really was`t happy with this place. First off the place looks very dirty, staff seats us at a table with no menus gave us water and we waited, finally came back and said you don`t want the buffet we said we did`t know how it worked it was are first time there. So we did buffet since we did`t get menus!! Not much choice at the buffet at 4:00pm bread naan was tough not fresh meats were just ok have had much better!! We had to ask for check and to pay so we could leave. Staff does not know how to act around people very bad!! Not going back"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, at least for my staples like chicken tikka and chicken curry. I would order to go, but I don't really enjoy staying here to dine in. The owner is very friendly with the customers, but for one dining experience, I found him a bit intrusive and loud with our party. I felt like he was angry one minute and laughing the next, over and over again. On the other hand, another table he was chatting with before us seemed very happy to have him around, so I don't really know... I would get food to go if I were staying in Old Town, but I would spend as little time as possible in here."}
{"text":"visiting from east on vac

great experience- fast friendly service in relaxing atmosphere

Signature dishes were excellent

will  definitely return next time we're in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Very authentic and by far the best in the valley. The staff is incredibly friendly and very accommodating. Overall an awesome experience from the time we walked in until we left! We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has teally nice service and excellent food. Lots of options and a nice atmosphere to come to."}
{"text":"This place is very popular, and for good reason. The food is very good. I loved the naan and Tikka Masala. The atmosphere and service were poor. The service and small tight seating area brought a would be 4 star place down to a 3 star place. If not for the good food I would have given The Taj Mahal the single star of shame. We had to search out an employee and ask for water and we still waited another 5 or 7 minutes to get it."}
{"text":"This is the worst value as far as Indian food. They give such small portions and overcharge. I would never recommend this to anyone. The reason they are so slow is obvious.  A horrible experience."}
{"text":"Walked by and tantalized by the aroma of Indian spices came inside and ordered the butter chicken, chicken vindaloo and garlic naan. Food great, lovely ambience and excellent service - really warm and friendly people run this place and work here which is always a bonus"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, although they brought us the wrong dish twice now. Definitely recommend trying this place though  :)"}
{"text":"I've been sampling Indian cuisine for some time now, this place nails it! From the owner Gill to our server Freddie the service is top notch! Saw that some complained of the prices, guess what? You get what you pay for and this place kills it! I'm upset only at the fact that we came here for dinner our last night in town! Next year will be different! Hope you enjoy the ambiance and food just as much as us!!! Thanks again Gill!!!"}
{"text":"Came down here for lunch buffet in Saturday. Decent selection of food. Little oily but most of the dishes tastes pretty good. Had a very good dhai vada after a long time.  Desserts weren't good.  As a whole good tasting indian food."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. There was a mix up with my dish but they fixed it quickly. The hood was hot and exactly what I needed on a cold night. 

Definitely recommend. Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"they have dansak, yes with pineapple, yes its good too

we loved the place, the samosas were not the best in our view, what is that weird cheese stuff in them ?

and the bill for 2 for curry at $85 was a bit steep for us tbh

its good and the owner is fun and really nice guy"}
{"text":"This is a stellar spot for Indian food - I'd say one of the best in town. Mark H. and I went out with Gayl and John B. as they were in town visiting from Washington state.  They always research restaurants before coming to Phoenix - gotta find new places to Yelp!  Anyway, this was one of the first places they wanted to try.

We had a large number of dishes which John B. ordered (he's British, so I think that makes him an expert on Indian food, since it's the only edible thing in Britain).  I eat spicy food, but I'm not a huge fan of the type of flavor that makes you lick bread or go running for the bathroom.  Maybe because of this, my two favorite dishes were the more mild ones.  If you come here, do not pass up the vegetable korma and the butter chicken.  I could have devoured an entire plateful of both of those dishes.  In fact, I think I did.  They also make a nice iced Indian Chai tea that comes with a free refill.

10/10 will be back."}
{"text":"Place is newly opened. Good food and owner was very nice! Had chicken Marsala and chicken curry. Two thumbs up...."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday evening for their buffet and I was not disappointed with their food! Everything was being refilled and the food was hot. They always had naan bread out (which is great because I think I eat 50% naan bread whenever I go to Indian buffets but I could never find a place that seems to put it out fast enough...). Everything was delicious, flavorful, and cooked really well. I'm usually a chicken tikka masala person but their paneers were super super delicious.

Service was okay. Our waitress was really nice but what I didn't like about the service was how they don't take your plates away until after you are completely done eating... I don't know about you but I don't like sitting at a table with my dirty plates piling up next to me. Especially since we were sitting at a small 2-person table, that was a bit of an inconvenience to me. I mean they were refilling our waters and everything, so it's not like they didn't see our plates.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place and hope to stop by again the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the variety from the buffet was pretty decent. Some of the food seemed a little dry and maybe because we ate there around 3PM. Ive ate at a few indian cuisine spots and this isnt the worst or best so I will give it a 3 stars."}
{"text":"The best Indian in Scottsdale!  
We love this place and come here so often they have our order memorized - right down to the naan.  The owners are wonderful people and the staff are extremely courteous and friendly.  My son always orders the chicken Tikka Marsala which is says is the best he has ever eaten and I always get a vegan dish. I have tried the curry, Gobi Aloo and the Saag Aloo all amazing! In addition we love the garlic and plain naan!  This is a must try if you are craving good consistent Indian food!"}
{"text":"J'habite dans le quartier et ce restaurant est devenu un de mes favoris. J'y vais souvent le soir après une dure journée de boulot pour relaxer dans ce restaurant calme, au service agréable et avec une nourriture simple et délicieusement épicée. 
Je recommande particulièrement l'agneau Vindaloo avec le riz aux légumes et le nan à l'ail. La bière taj mahal légère et fruitée se marie particulièrement bien à ces plats relevés ... Un bon restaurant à partager en famille, avec les amis ou seul. Ils ont même un service de livraison !"}
{"text":"I was really craving chicken tikanasala and it was also buffet hours. Walking in to discovering that there is barely was left and the next one would take some time so wasn't really happy about that but whatever they had tasted pretty good. I love their sweets.

{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant for Indian food in Montreal, can't say much about the service since its always the same lady who doesn't really like it when I don't pay for my female guest."}
{"text":"Very good. Best time to go is during the buffet, that way you get try everything (because it all is so good). Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here maybe 10-15 times over the last several years. We always get the Saturday evening buffet, which is always outstanding. We just had it again tonight. The number of dishes is very large, and there are a few southern Indian items along with the others (sambar and idli tonight). All the items are labeled, so you know what you are getting. There is a mix of common and not-so-common Indian dishes. We do wish there were a better way of marking the spicier dishes -- we don't like our food to burn our mouths! One of my favorite non-spicy items, always on the buffet, is Navrattan Vegetable Korma. It's especially delicious. All the desserts are delicious, especially the mango pudding. It looks like low-grade stuff out of a big can, but it's REALLY, REALLY good. I also like the halwah, which is a tasty but unusual dessert. I've noticed comments below about the service. It has changed styles several times over the years, moving between happy, down-home family style service and no-nonsense professional (which it was tonight). Either way, there are always plenty of people to attend to your needs. There is a big diversity of diners, from kids to senior citizens (us), with plenty of Asian people always present. There are often some large parties of diners (two groups of nine tonight), and there's a room off to the side to accommodate even larger groups. Everybody always seems to enjoy the food, and everybody always looks happy."}
{"text":"The lunch Buffett was delicious and had a great selection. I was very impressed by this little Indian restaurant and will return when I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"In our opinion, the best indian offering in the valley.  Chicken Danskak (pineapple curry) is one of the best i dishes I have tried.
Owner is an uber friendly and his energy is positive is. contagious.
Decor is a blend of modern contemporary with a flare of traditional. 
They actually have a beautiful and very large bar.  I have never been here at prime time, but the bar is definitely big enough to accommodate a large crowd. 
If you haven't been and love Indian and a pleasant ambience, I do not believe you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's just the best. The buffet is ever increasingly amazing. We visit the Taj Mahal every time we are in Pittsburgh. I've never had better Indian food anywhere."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I have to drag my wife to Indian style cuisine but, they do have car parts and seats outside, why? Run down, real bad.. One time stop and I live 2 seconds away. Shame really."}
{"text":"just finished tandoori vegetables, garlick naan, and lamb BBQ and I am feeling blissful. quite a tasty meal that keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"I feel if someone is from a specific culture they should know what it means to have good food from that culture. I have have been told by more than one person that \"The Taj Mahal\" is the place to go to get good indian food. 

I don't pretend to be an expert but it's a good sign when you see people from that ethnic background eating at the restaurant. It's usually bad sign if you see too many white boys like me lurking around. 

I can't remember what I ordered when I went here because the menu tends to confuse and never end. It seems they have listed pretty much every possible combination out on their menu but everything is delicious and authentic. You could pretty much order by closing your eyes and just pointing because everything sounds good and from my experience is good.   

The place has gotten a few upgrades in recent months making it seem a little less \"hole in the wall\" but the food is the same and worth a trip. They have a buffet that they do at lunch I believe which is different, and something I will have to give a try at some point."}
{"text":"I was here for a buffet. Service was good and the staff is friendly. 

I tried aloo dosa, idli and vada with sambar and groundnut chutney. They tasted just like homemade food. Vada is cooked well and had the right amount of oil that didn't make it greasy. 

Coming to the entree, I liked the vegetarian options they offered. Especially paneer Tikka masala and brinjal curry are my favorites. I should say that the non-vegetarian options I tried disappointed me. I had biryani  which didn't seem to have any meat pieces in it and then the chicken tandoori tasted bland and lacked seasoning. 

Finally the dessert items are a hit here. Especially the gulab jamun and mango pudding. Gulab jamun tastes just like homemade food with right amount of sweet. Mango pudding for me was just like mango lassi with a thick consistency. 

It is a good place if you are looking for some great vegetarian food and delicious desserts."}
{"text":"September 2016 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (#ISCUYE) met here for a delicious dinner and a fun time.  I have not had much Indian food since moving to the Valley, but this happened to be the best Indian dish I've had since I've moved here.  I ordered Lamb Vindaloo with a side of Aloo paratha, the Lamb was delicious, the paratha, mmm... not the way I had expected it to be.  I honestly could not care less about the paratha!  The Lamb was absolutely stunningly pleasing to my palate.  I asked for the level 1 hot.  If you like spicy food, but don't like the food too hot to enjoy the flavors, this is your spice level.  The server said it was the \"American Hot\".  I thought it was just right.

I would agree that the prices might be a little high for the amount of the serving... but then, I was stuffed after eating half my serving of Lamb Vindaloo.  Also, there were about 20 of us, it did take some time to get the food, so I do think the complaints about time-to-get food may have some truth to them.  I'm going to stop by for lunch to see how long it takes to get a lunch served.  I will update.  Update:. I returned the same Week to grab dinner for take out.  I noticed out front that lunch is served buffet style.

As you can see, I can't wait to return.  Yummy.  Thanks for hosting the September 2016 #ISCUYE!!!
