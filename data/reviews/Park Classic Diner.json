{"text":"I was back in Pittsburgh for just 5 days ... probably my last trip back for a long time.  My friends and I went to Udipi for dinner to celebrate my last night there only to find it was closed.  We were disappointed and all a bit sick from a flu but determined to find a local eatery to finish my 5 day reunion.  We drove through Monroeville and after driving past \"Evergreen Jumbo Super Chinese\" despite my friend's objections, I was hard pressed to find a top-notch local place.  As I was about to turn around, my friend said to continue for another light and that's when Park caught our eyes.  Everything about this place was strange ... it was like stepping back into a classic diner but clearly they modernized it recently.  The food was typical diner fashion but the real highlight was the milkshakes.  They actually use fresh fruit and blend everything right there.  No crappy syrups or frozen bananas ... this was top notch stuff.  Fast and friendly service topped off the night.  A little bit on the pricier side for a diner but nothing unreasonable."}
{"text":"The Park is like an Eat 'n Park, but different.  There are only three in WestPa and it is a 50's style dinning concept from the Eat 'n Park restaurant chain.  I ate breakfast here a few times as it was close to my hotel.    Atmosphere - 50's style dinner and a little dingier than I expected.    Service -   OK, the waitress seemed a little miserable and grumpy.  I was told by my coworker, who visited the place for dinner that the waitresses in the evening are more pleasant.  Maybe cause the evenings are dominated by college aged waitresses ... who knows?  Food - Similar to the what is served at an Eat ' n Park (just no Smiley Faces ... e.g. pancakes, waffles.)  I had the blueberry pancakes one time and french toast another.  Get the pancakes, they are great.  Avoid the bacon, which was cooked to dehydration and ready for the space shuttle.  Sausage patties were good as was the orange juice.  My coworker stated the milkshakes are excellent.  Suggestion - Since morning service is grumpy, go in the evening for the cheery coeds.  Overall - The Park was just ... OK,  I still like any type of Eat 'n Park better than the Denny's or IHOPs that I have been to, but it depends on which  E 'n P you go to as some are better than others at putting a smile on your face.    Hey, that was their old tag line!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town a year ago for a presentation and decided to stay in Monroeville to save some $.  Stumbled on this place and really enjoyed myself.   I'm from Boston, but grew up in small rural towns where the local restaurant had counter service and the help knew everyone.    It's the old comfort-food that appeals to me.   I just had a burger, fries and chocolate shake, dripping over the edges.   It was great.   I don't  need much, but a clean, well kept place with friendly people and fast service.     I would certainly go back and bring others.   Wish they had more than three diners in all of Massachusetts!"}
