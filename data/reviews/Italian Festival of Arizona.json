{"text":"1) the location - along the canal banks in Old Town Scottsdale - is ill-suited to the crowds. Cramped. Half the width of the walkway is taken up by the pop-up tents where the vendors are, leaving a narrow alley for people and their wandering kids to attempt to pass one another going in each direction. Bottlenecks very easily. This got highly annoying. The layout is a bit screwy, sort of a T-shape.  2) A ton of concrete around here and no grass... if it's a pleasant day, then it's just nice to be out wherever you are. If it is not a pleasant day, if it is a little warm... you will really feel it. The year I went, it felt like 100 degrees when it was probably in the mid-80s. Still kind of warm for spring, but the concrete everywhere did not help things.  3) The food and drink was a little pricey. I guess because Scottsdale.  4) Getting in with the Groupon discount was handled poorly by the ticket staff; disorganized. Though perhaps that is part of making the experience authentically Italian?  5) There are few places to actually sit and enjoy the entertainment. Especially the \"main stage\", everyone just stands around and then there are people trying to pass through from one side to the other. I can stand for a long time but it's not really a relaxing way to spend one's day.  The few positive things I can say: the entertainment was good and authentically Italian. The food was OK.  It is one of those things that you do it just to say you've done it... then you never go back again. I hope they can come up with a better location someday."}
{"text":"Save your money. Overpriced and boring. How do you have an Italian Festival and not have zeppoli? Or tiramisu? Better yet, how do you have people who work there who don't know what these are? Stay home and watch The Godfather."}
{"text":"Rock music no parking no thank you never again.  After spending a month in Italy nothing about this felt like Italy.  It felt like another annoying Scottsdale event"}
{"text":"We arrived early to avoid the crowds!! Good move! The day was gorgeous and I went with a girlfriend! The staff was friendly at the entrance-$15 fee a bit steep since it doesn't include anything!! The venue was pretty straight forward- Food, Some Entertainment and a few vendors! We weren't WOWed by the event- nothing out of the norm. We sampled some delicious pasta and had a yummy pastry as well! But, could have saved the $15 and just frequented an Italian restaurant...we did enjoy people watching and the gorgeous park area! Some helpful ideas-allow more space for walkway areas-when it started getting crowded it was annoying trying to move through the crowd of strollers and foot traffic making it impossible to really stop and look at the wares the vendors were trying to sell.  It was a pleasant time but not really sure what the $15 funded???"}
{"text":"The Fifth Annual Italian Festival of Arizona was the best we've attended in four years. The entertainment was wonderful...a little bit of opera, a little bit of Rat Pack, and a whole lot of Italian. The food was delicious and well worth the price, although more choices would be welcome. Seating remains a challenge. It would be great if some temporary bench seating could be installed in front of the stages. My only complaints concern issues with dogs. Example: My husband and I were heading to a table to enjoy the Italian beef sandwich we'd just purchased. I happened to be carrying the sandwich in one hand and a glass of red wine (of course!) in the other. A huge dog, although on a leash, got a good whiff of the sandwich and leaped toward me, causing me to panic and spill my wine, ruining my clothes. What a waste of great wine! Another example, and maybe the worst: Being well acquainted with the lack of seating, we brought folding chairs to sit in while enjoying the entertainment. However, most people didn't have chairs and were forced to plop down on the grassy knoll...some sat, some stretched out. None of them knew that more than a few dogs had been doing their business in that area. One polite dog owner went to a restaurant to get a napkin to clean up her dog's mess...but other dog owners just laughed it off and went on their merry way. There definitely needs to be a \"doggie relief\" area. Finally, we did miss the flag throwers from Italy. Hope to see them next year. All things considered, we had a great time. Thanks, Italian Festival of Arizona, for this year's improvements: the food, the wine, the entertainment, and the bocce ball court (although we didn't play, since the court was overrun with kids who were racing around and throwing the bocce ball around as if it were a beach ball. Maybe we'll give it a try next year...the court needs adult supervision). We'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"We got here early (11am) and it costs $15. at the entrance. There were two entrances and luckily we got parking spot. There's two big stages and lots of vendors for Italian food and shirts. It was smaller than I thought it would be. The food was delicious, I had eggplant parmigiana and sampled the spinach lasagna (made with cream sauce). Both dishes were about $8-$9 and the beers were $6, wine was $7. The wine garden was an extra $25 to get in, but we weren't going to drink a lot.       Overall it was fun and a beautiful day. We got a cannoli from Guido's for $4.50. I love Guido's in Scottsdale! I go there often when I'm in that area ( scottsdale and Shea) great food! About One o'clock it got pretty busy and we left. I'm not sure if I'd go again, because I could just go to Guido's! The entertainment was fun with all the Italian songs."}
{"text":"Awesome event. Had the most amazing Zeppolies I've ever had From John Anthoney's  bakery!! And the best sausage sandwich from guidos,  just flipping amazing. Wanted another sausage but line got too long.. don't listen to the whiners !"}
{"text":"If you thought the website for this event was not informative, that's because there was nothing to inform about! No one working in the credit card ticket booth so had to pay cash. A single, one-person wide path to enter. One person taking tickets and validating people who want to re-enter. Then you're packed behind people on the single narrow path who don't move because they're tasting one of many booths selling olive oil and tomato bread dipping sauces. Once you manage to edge into the rest of the festival, you find out ALL THE BOOTHS ARE FOR FOOD and not good food, either. OK that's not accurate. Fewer than 10 vendors that are selling non-food were selling dreck -- straw hats you can find in hardware stores' garden shops, tie-dyed rayon dresses. The music was predictable. Surely there's more to Italian culture than pizza, oilive oil and tomato sauce."}
