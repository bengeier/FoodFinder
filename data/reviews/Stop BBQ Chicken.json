{"text":"I love this place. It's continually high quality, and they spoil you with family-sized portions.   I recommend the \"Frango à milanesa\" if you're a fan of cheesy, chickeny goodness - it nearly brought a tear to my eye."}
{"text":"Wholesome, unpretentious homemade food in huge portions! This is the place to come to if you're hungry and in need of a decently sized meal for your buck's worth to fill up your stomach. Their creamy chicken casserole is a must-try. Plus the ladies behind the counter are lovely!"}
{"text":"Today's special was a tripe bean stew & it reminded me of feijoada which btw is only served on Saturdays. I have yet to find a place that will serve it on a weekday. The tripe was tender and along with the beans there were pieces of smoky linguiça & spare ribs. Together with the rice it made for a tasty & filling hearty meal. Now if you're like me and you want something spicy ask for their homemade piri piri, free of charge. The vinegary spicy piri piri added another dimension to the already tasty stew and made the meal even more satisfying.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back on Saturday to sample their feijoada."}
{"text":"Good, simple food with friendly service, this will be a regular place for me. The price is also quite reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Here you'll find simple, hearty and cheap take-out food. Daily stews, rice, vegetables and desserts.  I am a huge fan of the BBQ chicken myself...and the Portugese ladies who run the place are very nice."}
{"text":"First, name is a bit misleading as I assumed it was a Portuguese chicken place, but it's not...I think it's more Brazilian.  However, the 2 lovely ladies running this joint said it's Portuguese AND Brazilian!  Second, there are no sandwiches.  They have a dated posted menu that just has duct tape covering the prices on the sandwiches, but apparently they don't serve sandwiches anymore.    Instead, they offer great, homemade dishes in chafing trays.  My guess is that it was more Brazilian since I was not familiar with any of the offerings - except for the BBQ chicken which is only offered WHOLE.  A \"small\" round aluminum container of dishes of your choice was $10.  (I opted to \"stop\" here as opposed to McD's because I strongly believe in supporting small businesses over chains.)  I asked the lady to fill it with whatever dishes she recommended.  I also got a chicken ball ($1.50) - which I thought was a codfish ball - and the kind lady threw in an additional ball!  Maybe she knew that I'd like it and she was 100% right!  It was soo delicious and 1 wasn't enough.  \"Small\" was easily 2-3 servings!  Dishes comprised of rice/black beans/pork belly, pieces of sausage/olives/beans, chicken/cheese/peas, and some Parisienne potatoes.  Tbh, the Parisienne potatoes at Portuguese places are much better seasoned!  This was probably the \"weakest\" dish though.  The rest was DELICIOUS, especially the chicken/cheese/peas.  Highly recommended as a take-out place if you wanna try something new in the area!  There is seating, but it is more of a take-out place.  Ladies who were working there are very sweet!"}
{"text":"It's a small mom and pop Portuguese restaurant. It's a very sparse facility in terms of dining in, but the women running the place exude a lot of warmth. The Brazilian lady who cooks (and is the owner as well) is over 50 and her mother who helps out is over 70: both very sprightly, funny and hard working! They're always giving me free stuff to try out to educate me about Brazilian culture.  The food especially their pork dishes and rotisserie chicken is consistently good. Their rotisserie chicken is usually very moist, crispy skin and coated with great piri-piri. I'm a big fan of all their pork preparations: chops, ribs, belly, sweat meats, et all. The beef dishes can be a hit or miss. They also make good fried sardines, octopus stew, and cod fish chops. Sometimes, they'll even have game meat like rabbit or partridge. There's a lot of variety on offer each day: rice, potatoes, beans, chicken, fish, pork/beef. Their stews could be less oily and sometimes, even less salty ( but I take abnormally low salt in my food). For 10 bucks, hell even 8 bucks, I can eat two filling meals! It's hearty, tasty, fresh, unpretentious fare.   The food and hospitality get a 3.5.   Those in the 'hood, give this place yo dollars. Obrigado!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, living right around the corner, puts the awkwardly named 'STOP B.B.Q. Chicken Inc.' way up at the top of my reasons for continued patronage list. That said, I can't help but want to keep going back, despite the average-good quality of the food they serve.  First off, the resto is a family business that just opened a few months ago, the entire place is run by a Portuguese family including great-aunts, aunts, daughters, and grandmothers all working together to operate their new business as new immigrants to Canada.  The food is pretty good, although sometimes- maybe because I don't go in peak hours- the meat can be a little dry, or the veggies a little mushy, regardless it is always tasty and hot. The portions are very hearty, and if you show up with your own tupperware they will fill it up for you, to save the Styrofoam garbage. I've been offered samples on more than one occasion, tasting various Portuguese dishes and desserts that I otherwise would never have.  Ideal for take out, not sure if they deliver, the seating available is sparse, and the ambiance is kinda lacking.  Finally, they have these new cards that give you a free meal after the first 9 meals purchased. When it comes to bang for your buck, this place can't be beat.  Oh yeah, they also offer desserts, and baked bread. If you're in the neighborhood, check it out and help a local business - and don't forget your tupperware!"}
