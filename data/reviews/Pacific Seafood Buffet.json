{"text":"I've had better than this place. Yes it had unlimited sushi and other seafood, but the rest of the food was not bad but not good. I found that the only \"highlight\" was the dessert selection. I really wouldn't go back unless someone else paid."}
{"text":"This establishment has 2 locations.  This was our first time at this one.  It seemed to be a nice place when we arrived.  Cleanliness was approx. 3 stars and the hostess was vey nice.  Once we were seated the horrible experience began.  It took the server forever to fulfill our beverage request. Keep in mind there were only a few families in the restaurant.  My husband chose a soft drink I opted for water.  The food was okay.  There was a large variety of items not generally at buffets this was a plus.

About 10 minutes after we arrived our check was provided to us.  The server that was assigned to us had a terrible attitude.  She made sure to refill my husbands beverage  on several occasions.  My water was refilled once and I had to ask.  Her behavior disturbed me so much that I inquired with management about their protocol with the bill. I was advised the server was probably very busy and didn't realize her actions.  I was told don't worry about it just relax and enjoy dinner.  Although, it was evident that we needed assistance throughout the evening she consistently went out of her way to provide sub par service.

When paying the bill her attitude was still foul.  I believe wholeheartedly in compensating individuals who serve others.  In this case I could not, which really bothered me. This goes against every fiber in my being.  

The good thing is that we know not to every visit this restaurant again even if they were to provide dinner on the house."}
{"text":"We used to come here few years ago and the food was not bad..we decided to go back last night and this place is going down hill. We will definitely have to cross this restaurant out of our list."}
{"text":"I'm not expecting quality food here. I mean they have to mass produce if it is 'all you can eat', right? That being said, this place is pretty decent for what it is. 

The variety of foods was a pretty good mix of Japanese, Chinese, and American. I can see why people would take kids here that don't particularly have an affinity for Asian food: This place even has a decent selection of seafood. 

Won't be a regular, but if I'm ever in the mood for a buffet. I might hit this up again."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Pacific for a decade. As buffets in Chandler go they have always been a solid 3/5. I have even recommended them when people ask about a nearby by place to scratch that seafood? \"itch\". I was at nearby appt.and stopped in today. The host lead us all around the restaurant looking for a booth. (Filthy rag ,food and wet $) When I asked to sit in and ajacent clean table I was informed that I was being seated in the place where big people can get in and out. (Lol I thought I was doing ok I. My size 38 pants today but you got it.) The place else was smelling bad and looked as dirty as I have seen it. Save yourself some Saminala and have sushi somewhere nice."}
{"text":"So every year at Christmas time my boss forces me to come here. I mostly blame my boss because he is very OCD and cannot handle change very well. The food here is subpar ...I like Chinese food and Asian food I just do not like their food.

The servers are all courteous and authentic. The floor always seems sticky. Several desserts appear as though they were purchased from Costco and placed out buffet style.

My boss is Jewish so maybe he wants to eat Chinese food or be kosher for the holidays but there has to be a better place.
 
This place is
Not
Real
Special"}
{"text":"Pretty much standard Chinese buffet with some additional seafood items.  When I was there they had chicken feet which I felt obligated to try.  Not a good move.  I'm pretty sure they had frog legs too.  So if you're looking for some extra adventurous food, that's been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile you should check this place out.  The Chinese food stand-bys are all represented and aren't bad, didn't try the sushi either but it looked about like what it was supposed to.  Good service and decent food.  A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Went here last week for the first time  and was really happy with the experience. Everything was fresh and there was plenty to choose from. I went primarily for the sushi but was very pleased to see all the options available. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just came back for Pacific Seafood Buffet for Lunch. My wife and I got sick after eating there. Some of the foods are old and not clean. So, we got sick. This is our last time."}
{"text":"The most disgusting food I have ever tasted. Cold, old, saggy, bland. Just nasty. Do not eat at this place. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"We had a back room for 15 of us and the room was comfortable.  The food was good but I thought it was expensive for a buffet.  There was a huge selection of food and there were ample crab legs to take.  They kept refilling the hot food selections.  The waitress was friendly too."}
{"text":"I tried this place with family for the first time after reading all the great reviews. Boy was I in for a shock. This was a special occasion and we went there for Sunday lunch and hence it was a big let down. There certainly was a lot of variety but the quality was really really poor.
I feel sorry for the diners who gave 3 stars and above, because they truly do not know how good food tastes.
No one will answer any questions you have about the food and the people there are generally not friendly. 
I am certainly not planning on going back there, nor recommending this to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Good service. Good deal considering the amount of seafood and sushi available. Very clean and lots of variety. Food was pretty good, but nothing stood out as a \"had to have more NOW!\" thing. Did like the selection of ice creams to end the evening. If I was an avid buffet eater, I think I'd have a better experience :)"}
{"text":"did not enjoy at all! very low quality crab legs and (shell fish) over cook. but great sushi."}
{"text":"By far one of the best buffets I've been too . Would come back again. So many options for seafood and the endless crab legs were amazing. Enjoyable food and customer service"}
{"text":"This is the king of asian buffets! The price is a little high but its worth it. This is one of the few buffets were everything you try and put on your plate is good. Service was excellent well, especially for a buffet. 

P.S.=You better watch out for me in the lines cuz I'm ruthless when I get in buffet mode."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I mainly come for their sushi but their other items are decent. One problem once that I had was that I came in just as lunch was ending, the server and the hostess had me down for dinner, but I guess the sushi guys weren't informed of that and thought I had come in for lunch. One of the sushi chefs complained to the hostess that I was going for items from the dinner side. Nothing came of it as the hostess told him otherwise, I just found it odd."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good buffet with a nice atmosphere this is NOT the place to go.  These are the top 3 reasons why I won't be returning to Pacific Seafood Buffet anytime in the near future.
1. Crab Legs - The so called \"all-you-can-eat\" crab legs are a joke.  What this really means is about every 15-20 minutes one small container of crab legs is brought out wherein people come and literally fight you for them.  If you are not one of the first 3 people there when they come out, chances of you getting any are slim to none.  Also, the ones I were able to get were really overcooked and instead of the shells snapping apart they just sort of tore apart.
2. Ambiance - I could not believe how chaotic the atmosphere was there and felt like I was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of a restaurant. Granted it was a buffet but many of the kids were running into customers as well as staff making it a really unsafe environment.  There was one table of kids playing a spirited round of Simon Says while another group of about 7 kids were literally running around the restaurant playing Hide and Seek. 
3.  Service - I could not find any crab crackers so I asked one of ladies setting out food for one.  The only response I got was \"NO\".  I then asked if that meant there were no crackers at all or none right now and again got \"NO\".  I then asked what \"NO\" meant and again got just \"NO\".  I am still not sure if there were not any crackers left, if she didn't want to give me a cracker or she just didn't understand my question. Either way I thought this was a really rude response.
One good note is that our waitress was attentive and we always had our plates cleared and drinks refilled. Even so I was very disappointed overall and will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Best sea food around grate value for the bomb food your getting. A must go too if your in the area. Maybe they need a Lil more fruit and waiters with a bigger smile but all n all grate place. Very Good sushi for it being a buffet. Yummy crab legs frog legs and all kinds of shells."}
{"text":"Argh! The secret is out. Do not even try to go on a weekend. It is packed! Even on a Friday there's a wait to be seated. My only complaint is there isn't enough actual food food my daughters like here. They think the fried rice is too spicy. But there are so many options. Yummy seafood!!!!! Try the seviche! I could eat ten plates of it. This joint made me like crab legs which I've never really dug. The sushi is ok. I haven't tried the hibachi grill yet. I like that you can order alcohol here too. I would suggest maybe adding some pie on the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Came with some family for dinner one night.

Except we came at a time where it was right in between lunch and dinner. The waitress was nice and charged us lunch prices while we began our meals. 20 minutes later after they added more food variety for their night crowd, the waitress watched us like a hawk and as soon as we picked up a \"dinner item\" she re-charged us for dinner prices. I didn't really mind because I understand their dinner has more food (crab legs, sashimi, etc). It was just annoying that in the middle of our meal the waitress had to come to our table and lecture us about it.. I don't frequent this area as I'm not from here.. but I guess many people come here around the same time to fight for lunch/dinner prices so they watch their customers like a hawk on how they eat...Weird! Made me feel a bit uncomfortable. 

The crab legs were pretty delicious with the butter sauce next to it! But all the other dishes seemed very oily and on the day that I was there they didn't seem to refill their pans of food unless it was near the bare bottom of the dish. Their dim sum items looked very dry. Their \"fried\" calamari/fish, etc seemed like they were near burnt status. 

The sushi was eh. As soon as they brought out the raw fish I was so tempted to eat the whole plate! Until I had a closer look. Their salmon had a very dark brown tinge to them. None of the fish was fresh or even looked edible really.. I guess it's hard to serve sushi in a buffet setting when the locals aren't exactly ecstatic over sushi as I am! 

The great thing that I really loved (on their dinner menu) were the crab legs! (down side about it is that you have to crack and open the shells up yourself with no instruments available -- so it can be a tedious task just to eat crab! The plus side is that it's fresh-er crab meat :P ). 

Overall, I'd probably come back with the family if they wanted to. Just not too keen on their big-brother- watching-you style."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
love the grilled sole fish and fried blue crab!"}
{"text":"It isn't a sea food restaurant it's Chinese food.... i ate here last night and now I can't stop shitting my pants. Plus it was extremely expensive."}
{"text":"We have gone to this buffet on and off for the last couple of years and the experience has always been good.  Last week, on a Sunday, we went and had a disappointing experience.  The sushi station was at its worst with little or no product coming out.  The sashimi was none existent and when it did finally make an appearance (at the end of our meal) it was frozen.  The sushi station workers had their backs toward the customers and would not acknowledge us.  Management was not at the location to speak with, so instead I spoke with a hostess who said they get many complaints about the sushi station and its employees.  I wrote Pacific Seafood last week, and to date have not been given a response.  Lets face it, you go to a seafood buffet for the seafood...the sushi...sashimi...crab legs.  If these key products are unavailable what is the point.  There are too many seafood buffets in the Phoenix area to chose from so my family and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Hi not going to say anything bad but I don't really have a lot a of good to say either it was OK. I guess I don't like buffets anymore. Went there for lunch great variety."}
{"text":"Better than average food for a buffet. Varies a little bit which is why I am not giving them five stars. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents. It was very expensive for what they offer. Yes they offer crab legs and sushi etc... but the crab legs I had to stand in line forever for some because they keep them in the back so they don't have to re- fill them right away. They where always low on there clean dishes. For dessert they ran out of choclate syrup so I asked a worker and she ignored me like I was a bother to ask her. Then I had to get someone else to grab it. Over all I waited 9 minutes for choclate syrup. So I recommend this place if you like waiting for food, bad waitressing, and food that's not fresh!!"}
{"text":"DAMN! this place has everything, sushi, pork, chicken, beef, soups, shrimp, fruit, Ice cream even pizza. OK this is the kind of place that is dangerous for a big man trying to downsize. I almost went and found the manager to have him bar me from this place! It's just too tempting! It's like one of the really good seafood buffets in Vegas. I saw no down side to this place. Me and a friend had lunch and it came to $24.00 for two, I could have easily ate that in shrimp and ribs alone. Man I'm getting hungry just typing this. If you like a good, clean and plentiful buffet this is the place. Damn they are good!"}
{"text":"Seafood is not that fresh and the customers there are rude. People werre staying on the line or cutting line for crab legs??!! Looks like they've never seen crab legs in their lives before....

The only plus thing is the sushi. I guess it is considered above average in a buffet restaurant around here. Of course Todai (the chain Japanese seafood buffet restaurant) is way better but it does not have any branch in Phoenix at all.

You don't have to go to this place for crab legs because other buffet restaurants serve crab legs too...."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for a buffet then this place is the place to go for great Asian buffet.  The staff was wonderful and food is constantly coming out and you don't have to wait for it.  I also wanted some watermelon and one of the staff freshly cut me some watermelons.  Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ha, it was that good. We went late in the day, Father day. They were very busy and kept most everything full and fresh. It was impressive. As buffet's go this is the one to measure by.."}
{"text":"I gotta first say that my past review of this place was based on the food. The restaurant is also a self serve all you can eat buffet, so the host and wait staff has generally a shorter list of responsibilities as compared to the common restaurants with wait staff taking orders.

The food is as expected to be good but we know that it is the staffs responsibility to make the experience Great!

Now, we arrived a party of 5 and received a number to be called out as tables were available. We started to notice other families arriving after us being seated before us with a larger head count. After asking about our table and why are we being overlooked, Tony decides to try to make excuses rather apologies. I saw our party and number scratched off the list then written back in after they have made their error. 

Now, I'm a reasonable professional also with the common sense to know NOT to make excuses, cause you know that it makes you look like a fool. But all I expected was a simple apology, that would have been suffice for their error. 

But Tony insists on carrying on his foolishness with excuse after excuse with no sense of accountability. Seriously, bring in an experienced employee that can teach you some humility. Upon leaving, I noticed the hiring sign outside ( pictured ) Someone please show Tony how to properly host and serve your patrons."}
{"text":"I eat at the pacific seafood buffet a couple times a week.   They have a wide selection of food but I primarily come in for the sushi.  The staff is very friendly.  Being a frequent patron they know exactly what I want and how I want it.   Throw a couple dollars in the tip jar and the sushi chefs will make you your favorite rolls every time they see you."}
{"text":"Today was a big disappointment.  From dirty dishes to hair in the dessert.  Plus Sunday is the most expensive day to eat here.  Adult $16... Food choices weren't anything special.

The sushi was plain cucumber filled with boring.

The chicken on a stick tasted really good.  

You're better off going to the China buffet for better food.  Every different shrimp title tasted the same.  Although there is a variety of food to choose from I'd rather have quality.

My second time eating here and after today I won't be back.  My stars go out to the waitress not the food."}
{"text":"Food was fairly good. Service was mediocre. But best part is kids running around everywhere. Two different items both had hair on them"}
{"text":"A great place for you to bring out of towners who have an appetite.  This place  does passable conveyor line sushi.  Handrolls, spicy tuny rolls, salmon skin rolls, mackerel, tuna, salmon, tako (octopus).
In the mood for Mongolian barbecue.  THey have it at the back wall.  Chinese pork chashiu.  Korean barbecue.  Roast beef.  
Broccoli and beef fan?  Its there.  Shrimp salt grilled style? Present and accounted for.  Taiwan style chow mei fun (rice noodles) ? Present.  Frog legs?  yep and very tasty.  Dim sum?  yep but its buns, phoenix claws, and sui mai and pineapple rice.  
Lots of crab claws and legs, too.  
And it all tastes good to decent.  
Drinks available and there is even a small bar.  Flat screens play sports or whatever movie of the moment.  
The waiters and waitresses are attentive and cheerful.  
A good decent place."}
{"text":"My favorite!!!  I do wonder how they would stay in business if every customer was like me though.  The sushi is always melt in your mouth fresh and everything else that Ive tried is good too."}
{"text":"Only went once, but it was great. The food was really good and it has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a fairly decent buffet that contains a good selection of sushi.  One thing I noticed when we first entered the place was the number of Asians dining here.  Being of Asian descent myself I think this is a good indicator of the quality of ethnic oriental cuisine.  Unlike the Chinese buffets on the west side of Phoenix where the majority of customers are \"Latino\" and most being of questionable immigration status.  It turns my stomach when I see their unsupervised kids reaching for food in the buffet line with their bare hands which I suspect weren't washed in the first place.  One may question why I suspect the legality of their immigration status?  Take a cautious trip to the restrooms and if you see pieces of used toilet paper smeared with fecal matter in the waste paper basket this is a strong indicator these people are recent arrivals from south of the border.  I don't understand why the county health dept. doesn't crack down on this serious public health issue.  So stay away from the buffets on the west side of Phoenix.
Now getting back to PSFB, my visit to the restroom was satisfactory finding it fairly clean and tidy.  Whenever we're in Chandler we will continue to dine here unless health issues and/or food quality issues change for the worst, at which time an updated post will be made."}
{"text":"The food was awful. The crab had no meat in the legs. The restaurant was filthy. We won't be going back. Definitely a waste of $39 for 2 adults."}
{"text":"Not good. Id pay 16$ to NOT eat here again. We were stared down by the chef while getting food? The place was hot and muggy and smelled like a fart. There was a glass barrier above the ice cream that forces you to lean over the first row of ice cream to get to the second, making you breathe all over the ice cream! GROSS.
The server and hostess were somewhat nice though."}
{"text":"This place is awful: the raw oyster has obviously gone bad when I was there yesterday. It tasted like shit and I was so disgusted and almost threw up. The section where they serve crab legs smells like they are using some bad ingredients/cooking oil. Bottom line is I will never come back to this place and eat again"}
{"text":"$24 was how much it coast for me and my girlfriend to go out for all you can eat durning lunch time. The food was nothing amazing. Everything was luke warm. But it did fill the hole. I ended up just eating a lot of shrimp, hard to mess that up lol. Sushi was a lil sketchy to eat cuz idk how long it's been sitting there for. Overall probably won't be going back there."}
{"text":"The cost is 17.88 for Adults and 10.88/ 8.88 for Children plus drinks 1.99 per person. Food quality was okay not bad and service was good. The only thing is the place smells very bad, it smells like old carpet and yesterday's trash. It also feels like a nursing home with the out dated furnisher and the choice of colors."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate New Year with our family and the food was terrible, including poor service. It's been a while since we have returned and today will be the last. Such a disappointment!!! Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet. Great selection. Grilled teryaki chickens and grilled boneless spare ribs were fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food....better than most buffets in the valley. They have a large variety of foods  and the sushi, for buffet sushi, is fantastic. 

Ambiance...cleaner than most Asian buffets I have been to and the food is spread out enough. I have been here on two occasions. Once, weekend evening, it was crowded enough that I felt put off. Second time, lunch weekday, it was dead and I felt far more comfortable. I must say the restroom was very clean.

Staff...nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about.

Verdict...if your hungry enough this is worth the money."}
{"text":"Been here on numerous occasions (both lunch & dinner) and have never been disappointed.  There is a wider selection at dinner...but the lunch price is almost 1/2 that of dinner and the selection is still huge.

Every time we come here...I swear to try something at every station...but there are just too many.  You do feel like you're at a Vegas casino buffet or on a cruise.  Some of the items are really good while others are mediocre...but for the value & selection, everyone is bound to find a boatload of things they'll like.

This is a good place to go when you're 1) super hungry and can eat a cow, 2) like having a large selection to chose from, or 3) w/a group that can't decide to do Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian or Vietnamese.  This place has it all and something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Huge variety of so-so food. The seafood, for which I'm assuming the restaurant gets its name, is not great.  The atmosphere is nice, and for a very busy restaurant on a Saturday night, we were seated pretty quickly. I don't live in AZ, so not sure that I will be back. When I visit the area again I might try it again to see if I fare better. My selections may have just been off this time."}
{"text":"We had our dinner last night in pacific seafood buffet. And at some point when we were going to get some food, we found cockroaches on the cakes and cookie sections . when we talked to the manager, they didn't even bother not charging us for the food. It was disgusting and very disappointing. I also took some pictures of the cockroaches."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for a long time. The food is always good and fresh on weekends. If you want to go on a week day, I would suggest lunch time, as the food can be a little old at dinner time unless it's a busy evening. Fabulous desserts and ice creams. Sushi is great too."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese buffet! I had a chance to visit Tempe last year and my friend brought me to this place and I've since then wanting to go back. You'll never find better deal around this area. I went for their dinner and it costs about $17 with tax. Fresh palm sized oyster (seasonal), sashimis, snow crab legs, roasted duck and many more. Great varieties without compromising quality. Will DEFINITELY go back again the next time I went down to Tempe or felt the need to gain some pounds!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely disgusted with this place.. Flies are all over, I'm swatting them as I type.. The food is cold ,no flavor, grossest items like chicken feet, cold crawdads, mushy  skinny watery crab legs, fish with eye balls,mushy squid , cold stretchy baby octopus .. I feel sick 
...Not to mention this is an Asian place and our greeter at our table didn't speak a lick of English.. Since I have never been there before I needed to know how it works what it costs ect... She kept saying \" you eat\" omg"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best buffet in the Phoenix Valley.! It is like a Vegas Casino Buffet got transported here. Everything from dim sum to escargot. Crab legs and a huge sushi bar. Their fish quality is very good for a buffet. Exceptionally good food and a selection that can't be beat! Now where are the black jack tables? and bring me a single malt scotch!"}
{"text":"I have been to here in quite a few times, the price is very good, it is worth to have those foods."}
{"text":"Im pleasantly surprised by this place! A lot of variety and im just here for lunch. Everything was really good and they did a good job at keeping the food coming fresh. The sushi was fresh also. Will def return! Probably best buffet I've had since living in Arizona (3 years)"}
{"text":"was there today 1-8-16 very disappointed most items cold a lot of things not marked didn't know what they were .when i asked a couple of workers they no English .when we paid no one asked how it was so there was a surprise i told her what we experienced and nothing .wouldn't ever go back and was over priced but you live and learn don't make the same mistake go somewhere else ..."}
{"text":"Meh!

2nd time here...11.99 for a meal here is a joke. The food isn't that good, the waitresses are mediocre and dense. And the help in the back will knock you down if you are in the way when they are moving food  trays around. This one lady cook asst. kept running into me without saying excuse me. Not acknowledging I was there. The atmosphere is decent, except when you here the cooks in the back yelling out things over the speaker...I don't wanna hear that while eating. 
Ok, I'm from New Orleans and I've been in Arizona for 4 years....the food is just bland here"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of seafood complemented with more traditional Chinese cuisine. Nicely presented with items frequently replenished. Sashimi and sushi are nicely crafted and plentiful. Shellfish selection is surprisingly varied and well prepared. Good dessert bar with premium ice creams. Attentive servers."}
{"text":"This is my first review, so please bear with me! (= 

Compared to buffets in the neighboring area, PSB is pretty good for its value. 
I've come here multiple times, and it's just a nice place to eat at if you are craving some sushi, variety, and/or Chinese food. 

COST: Adult Lunch (Mon-Fri) = $9.38/person. For 2 adults: Subtotal + Tax = $20.86 (and whatever tip you choose to give)

QUALITY & VARIETY OF FOOD: Out of all the buffets I have been to around Glendale, I would have to say that this buffet has the best quality of sashimi. There is a pretty good variety of sushi there, ranging from the common California roll to the Dragon roll (or something equivalent to that). The ice cream selection is really nice, and they offer 8 selections (including strawberry, chocolate, mint chocolate, rainbow sherbet, vanilla, and green tea). Crab legs were not bad at all, and tasted fresh. They had salad, mussels, stuffed mushrooms, kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, some type of fish, fried shrimp, etc. For soup, they had egg drop soup, wonton soup, and  white fungus sweet soup dessert with dates.   

RESTAURANT AMBIANCE: The entryway is actually nicer than expected. Tables are placed a good distance from each other. Clean and bright atmosphere. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: The staff is prompt at refilling your drinks. The only issue I had was with the hostess, who was quite grumpy as she greeted and seated us. A minute afterwards, when another couple came in, she was all smiles with them. I don't know what made her treat us differently, but it sure didn't make us feel good. 

COMPARABLE TO...: If you are willing to drive a bit more (or less, depending on where you are from from), I would suggest World Buffet. These two buffets are comparable."}
{"text":"I'm not much into Seafood but love Sushi. This place has really good & fresh Sushi. They'll even make what ever you want. The Mussel & Crab Legs were yummy as well. They have plenty of other choices if you're not into Seafood."}
{"text":"The last time I came half of the buffet entrees were empty, I inquired about it with management.  They took 20 minutes to refill the soup which I eat first before anything else.  It was the cooks that were taking a break all at the same time.  I saw all of them eating and only one was cooking and filling the empty dishes.  How rude management was, I hope she's reading this review because I will go over her head and make sure she is fired or demoted.  Ignorant Asian woman, they should hire an American born person."}
{"text":"Nice location, very comfortable and clean dining area and food serving area. Has a nice seafood theme. Food choices are excellent and varied. If you just want Chinese and not Seafood you can fill up here. Some of the chicken dishes were very good. Orange, coconut and spicy were great. Large fruit and salad section. Many choices for desert including Breyer's ice cream. Friendly serving staff. Pricing was comparable to other of it's type. But, I think this buffet is a cut above the rest in our area."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet for Arizona.  Decent selection of cooked chinese, sushi, mogolian bbq, soups, seafood, yada, yada, yada.  I got there at 5 pm so it was relatively empty, but it was packed by the time I left at 6.  Since it seems to draw a large crowd, there's good turn-around on the food items and they seem to replenish them frequently.  I did see one fly on one of the food dishes that kinda irked me out, but that's the only one I saw.

My only real gripe about this place has to deal with a small portion of the customers and not the restaurant.  On more than one trip up to the buffet, I saw adults, yes adults, grab food from the food trays with their bare hands!  Are you people such friggin savages that you can't make the extra effort and grab the friggin tongs that are right there in front of you.  Using your bare hands???  Are you f***in kiddin me???  Seeing that kinda ruined it for me and also prevented me from eating those particular dishes as well.    

Of course, that's not the restaurant's fault...but it is still disturbing nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love this place! Crab, crawfish,sushi, and all my other favorites. Great seafood selection. Good service. Prices are very good for what you get."}
{"text":"We have tried a bunch of Chinese buffets but this one has been the best we've experience!
We will definitely come here again and again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The place had a cleaning solution smell. Something like ammonia. Tried to eat but the smell gave me and my husband a head ache. The food was bland had no taste. Left right away and had to pay almost $50.00 for two people and we did not even eat. I told the person at the door and she did nothing. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. They offer crab legs which raises the overall price (understandable) but then the crab meat is extremely over cooked and mushy. The place itself looked and felt dirty and had flies. It didn't seem like the air conditioner was on at all since it was uncomfortably hot while eating. The food was not good. Would not recommend this place and will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for about ten months now and we finally made our way through the doors. Even from the start, our meal could only be described as disastrous. Halfway through our SECOND round of food our drinks finally made it to the table. We tried majority of the food that they had to offer; the only item that wasn't repulsive was the clam chowder. Other than that, everything else was absolutely putrid. Nothing was seasoned well, everything was either so overcooked that it has hardened or was so underdone that it was questionable if it had ever touched the stove top. The reason we even gave it a one star rating is because Yelp does not allow you to rate with zero stars. We would never recommend this place to anyone, even our worst enemies. Pacific Seafood Buffet would have to pay their customers to eat their food in order for them to fill half their dining room with patrons. Thank you for taking the time to read our review. Hopefully we saved someone from punsihing their taste buds."}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews on Yelp (and elsewhere).  DO not believe any of the good reviews!  The food was mostly disgusting!  We tried a little bit of everything and none of it was any good.  My son wouldn't even eat the ice cream.  It was the cheapest kind you could buy.   I complained to the manager and he just offered a 10% discount.  Which means that we paid $48.00 for 2 adults and one 11 year old.   WAY too much for this s-hole.  I would stand out in front with a sign warning people if I thought it would keep people from wasting their money.  However, the restaurant was jammed full....  So, I can assume that the locals either have terrible taste or EXTREMELY low expectations.  Either way, I may have to move to a different city.   I think I have said enough..."}
{"text":"Nice reasonably priced clean buffet with lots of choices and great service!!! Casual and clean!!!"}
{"text":"The food is best @ dinner, but the biggest turn off are the jackass' that eat there. I've been going since they opened years ago, and with out question every time if there's a family of \"non residence\" they send the whole family up to take every single crab leg piled as high as they can, then they go back with new plates to get their regular meals then everyone else has to wait til later when they bring more, then the cycle repeats. Don't believe me I challenge you!! Then their under aged brats go up unsupervised and touch everything and make a friggin mess, but hey I've only seen it for years maybe it's a mirage."}
{"text":"I stop by here friday night with several friends. Several people advised me to come early to avoid the crowd. so I came at 5:30 Pm. The place was relatively empty for a Friday nite. As time go by, few people did trickling in - no where near a crowd; as I been for-warned, the place was ... not even close to full.

We were seat promptly - as the place was pretty empty. Waiting staff was very friendly, drinks were promptly served.

The ambiance could use a little improvement, but ..I can overlook it; after all I am here for the food - not the atmosphere. The place is clean. Price $18.00/ person is very fair. 

Food section is pretty decent, Quality of product is pretty decent (considering this is a buffet, quality is IMO above average). UNFORTUNATELY, all the food I picked out tasted BLEND - Almost NO FLAVOR !!!, Good thing they had a SOY SAUCE bottle on the table, otherwise I would've throw it away. (I don't like to waste food, I hate people who do, but this come mighty close for me to break my own rule).

I worn't be rushing back here anytime soon, However, $18/person for all the crab leg I can eat, I am sure I will come again."}
{"text":"Love the variety at this place. On top of the regular buffet items, they have a bar with fresh food that the chefs cook up for you after you put it together. And who would not love a sushi bar at an all-you-can-eat place??
The only negative thing is how oily the veggies and most food are (I guess that's what makes people full faster) and the raised new prices. Went there yesterday with my boyfriend and paid $42 plus tip (included 2 iced teas). If I break it down, I was far from eating $20 worth of food. I'd still go back occasionally though."}
{"text":"Really bad. Service was bad. Food was dry and old. Cockroaches crawling everywhere. Gross."}
{"text":"How hard is it to write the names of the dish on the buffet? I like to know what I'm eating. After my 10 minute investigation, food was decent. Not great but decent."}
{"text":"Great selection of food for a good price. Always go here for lunch when I want to go to a buffet."}
{"text":"A little bit on the expensive side for asian buffet, but the food was amazing. All the food was fresh and hot. Quite a large selection of sushi and grilled items. My favorite buffet so far"}
{"text":"This review is based on service alone. Let me say first off the food was pretty decent for a buffet. Enough said.
This was the first time we have been there. My wife and kid got there about 330 and was asked if we wanted lunch or dinner. It was still lunch prices, so I said lunch. And off to eat we went.
After eating for a bit, they brought out crab legs which looked great . I didn't make it to the table, when our waitress informed me that since I was paying for lunch I couldn't have my crab legs unless I payed.
I was only wanting to pay a lunch price, so I said no to paying more. And yes I get it crab legs cost more, but she then took the plate out of my hand right at the buffet.
That was embarrassing to say the least. I was left wondering where those legs are going?? In the trash....or back in the mix?? hmm
I just wish I was told ahead of time about what food I could and could not have."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there for dinner and it was a huge disappointment. First of all, they have raised their prices $1 supposedly for the rising cost of crab legs. HOWEVER, they only brought out one tray of crab legs every 15 minutes or so. That meant people were standing in line in front of an empty tray. When the crab legs arrived, the first  and second people in line would load their plates for themselves and others in their party. You were out of luck if you were third in line. Consequently, the dollar increase has no impact on the amount of crab legs served to their customers.

Lastly, I got explosive diarrhea after eating there. I am not sure what did it, but the crab legs were NOT good. (I never knew there was such a thing.) The only other things I ate were watermelon, the wontons, and stuffed shrimp. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Definately the best seafood buffet I have found in AZ, its a little pricey but its worth it"}
{"text":"First of all I am very difficult to please this restaurant is the number one Asian buffet restaurant in Phoenix. Without a doubt the people there are very nice but that's not the big deal let me start by saying excellent food always nighttime king crab sushi all you can eat real sushi like me not just rice and a vegetable and sour cream inside Real sushi and then the rest of the Chinese food is fantastic the place is a little more expensive than most but face totally worth it my wife and I all the time go there it's greatthere's another good Asian buffet restaurant on cactus and the 17 that's really good about half the price or a little less but really good on the shrimp and everything but this place is the number one restaurant for all you can eat."}
{"text":"I feel ripped off. I went on Sunday (so 18.88 all day so a normal buffet price) and i expected a decent meal. The crab legs tasted like rubber and left a strange aftertaste in my mouth. I tried a variety of sushi and all the ones i got were old and some were even rancid. Its a shame that i cant find a decent asian buffet here in az. This is the third one i tried around  this area and overall this is one of the worst buffet experiences that i have had in quite some time. And just 10 minutes into eating they already give me the check. Gtfoh im not even halfway done...  You cant pay me to eat here again.  Ehh maybe i just came at a bad time but i wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food. Good sushi selection. Good service. Lots of selection and food is always fresh. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet a few times, and  they have the typical buffet food--crab legs, sushi, Mongolian beef, etc.  They do have the best Mongolian BBQ I have seen, with Korean kalbi, prime rib, chicken, and fish.  They also have some specialties like frog legs and duck.  In addition, the dessert is pretty good with many different types of fruit, eight varieties of ice cream, and strawberry and brownie cake. 

Unfortunately, their service is spotty at times.  One time, we had to wait very long because there was a huge party(probably 100 people!) that had reserved most of the buffet.  I don't think this is fair to the rest of the customers and it is obvious they could not manage this very well.  

But as long as this doesn't happen too much, this place has pretty good food and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time tonight. I chose to come here because of the great reviews it received. The food over all was 3 out of 5 stars. The sushi was good, but the tempora was a little soggy as opposed to the crunchy taste we have all come to know and love. I even waited till they brought out the fresh shrimp tempura and it was still soggy.... I waited for the crab legs and when they brought the new bucket of legs, I waited in line but by the time I got to get my plate, they were gone. The wings were good and most of the items in the buffet were good. Finally I waited at the crab legs station until they brought out the new bunch, and the crab legs tasted pretty good. But there was nothing to break the legs or get into the shell so I had to break everything by hand. Overall it was good, but I will probably go to Angry Crab or Joes Crab Shack if I am in the mood for sea food."}
{"text":"I love to eat at this place I would I eat there every weekend if I could . the price is right food is great."}
{"text":"I would give this place a lower rating if there was one. I used to frequent this restaurant when I worked in Chandler and was very happy with the quality. I have since moved away but went back today with family and what a 180 turnaround difference! The place was filthy, the food was tasteless, cold, and one could tell the desserts were served more than one day by their dried out condition.  I brought our concerns up to management but all we were offered were ridiculous excuses. (I found it interesting that I was not the only one who was complaining tonight).  That will be the last time I frequent that restaurant and will be trying a new place that some other people we were talking to on the way out had said was excellent along with having the old manager and chef of this restaurant when it was excellent. Do yourself a favor and try another place. There are too many great buffets to settle for a place that is way past its prime."}
{"text":"The variety. The atmosphere. The Aroma. Imagine yourself sitting on a raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The heat of the suns rays are chipping at your perfect skin. Dehydration is setting in. Just when all hope is abandoned, a Pacific Seafood Buffet waitress is sailing towards you from the seemingly desolate horizon.  Carrying with her a cheaply make hard plastic cup  that says Pepsi cola even though its filled with Coca Cola. The way she moves like a mermaid and her ability to keep your drink refilled is second to none. Almost like she's part of  nasa car pit stop crew waiting on you to get up to grab your next round of food and in seconds the cup went from half empty to half full.  Strolling down those isles of food make you feel like a king. With an empty plate and 7 rows of food the possibilities are almost endless. The sushi is as if the fish were caught within the hour. From the American kitchen and Assorted Chinese chicken to the salad bar. You wanna travel to every island in the pacific for less that 12.50 on a Saturday from 11:00 to 4?Don't go to trivago or Expedia cause there is a Best Western down the street from this vacation of a spot."}
{"text":"I showed up with great hopes and a open mind not knowing anything good or bad about the place. There was plenty of food to eat. Upon filling my plate and returning to the table I found some of the food that should have been hot was not and it made me nervous. The food doesn't exhibit that any love was made in creating it. I didn't get sick from the food but I got to tell you the food seem to be just a little bit rougher in my stomach just because it may have been over cooked and harder than it should have been. And the amount of traffic through there that is customers it reminds me of a 24-hour IHOP. The whole place just doesn't have the Polish and finesse that the building and architecture and initial quality of the food before cooking is suggesting. It's definitely a high volume chain and nothing Gourmet. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for lunch; great selection of seafood dishes -- crabs, shrimp, clams, fish, prepared in various ways.  Had a sushi section and selection was pretty good!  Would like to see more sashimi and tuna nigiri sushi.  I ate mostly sushi the entire time.  Mom & aunt liked the other prepared foods.  It was quite expensive when going on weekends.  Our server was attentive, filling my glass of iced tea and Mom & Aunt's cups with tea and coffee.  Will probably go back, but not on weekends."}
{"text":"I love the tuna and the seared tuna along with the sushi chef who delivers fresh fish.  The girls are beautiful and very good at service.  Crab is unbelievable and the rice is nice."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood buffet places I have been. They have good selection and of course very tasty food! 

Its an excellent place to go with friends and family! Thank you very much for great service!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since I left Arizona about a year and a half ago, so all I have left are my memories. As buffets go, this one is really good. They have lots of different dishes, almost all of them tasty. The sushi is pretty good for a buffet. But what makes this place stay in my mind months and months later, are the desserts. Most Asian buffets I've gone to don't usually have desserts so I was pleasantly surprised to see this one did. I love the donuts with the sugar liberally covering them and my favorite, the little red-bean cake/dumplings. Delish! How I miss them."}
{"text":"This place probably is one of the best Chinese buffet in the valley. For the price of $16.99 per person, they offered a great variety of seafood. They probably have more stuff here than other places. The restaurant was clean and does not have an odor like in some of the other  Chinese places. Decoration is much nicer than other places.  Not salty like other Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Must have gotten there at the wrong time.  11:30am.  Fried shrimp, cold, french fries , cold, hickey, cold.  Chicken, cold.  Even fried rice was just warm.  Not on my go back list."}
{"text":"Visited today. A friend told us about the place and we were not disappointed! My dad loves to try and have us try foods made/from around the world. You can have your traditional Chinese and other Pacific region food. We went during the lunch special (which was $10.99) on a Saturday (that's a good weekend price). We do eat at Crazy Buffet (at Priest/Elliot) and their all day/night price is $11.99 (with crab legs) and no drink. I'm glad that there is a restaurant that serves food that I would have never have thought of eating. It was a cultural experience that I will go back to again and again."}
{"text":"I normally love this place for dinner. I always come for the crab legs but tonight they were terrible! Normally they are very big, clean and taste great! Tonight they were very small, quite dirty and tasted old and bad. I was disappointed tonight."}
{"text":"Cheap, good food, and good prices! My uncle and I went here, paid $11 each for all you can eat, a great deal! The sushi is made fresh in house, and there is a Mongolian stir-fry in the back for people who like their good fresh!
Overall, a great place! Definitely worth trying for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is the best buffet I've ever been to in Arizona.
LOADS of different and rare seafood items including welk, which is pretty flavorless and takes on whatever sauce you decide to have with it. I recommend you dab several different ones on the side of your plate and experiment.
So much to describe, and there are also a lot of standard Asian buffet items.
There's also a sushi bar and oysters. Maybe find out when the oysters come in so you get them fresher. I went there one time and I think the oysters might not have been as fresh. The sushi is professional and made right in front of you non-stop.
It's pricey but totally worth it. I recommend going in for lunch on the weekend (don't eat breakfast) right at 11am and make your experience last over two hours. Trust me, it IS an experience. That meal will last you all day. Don't feel guilty about gorging yourself. I hope you go with an open mind and try something you've never had. Everything is worth a try, just have a plateful of spoonfuls. You never know!"}
{"text":"I wished I lived here so I could eat here more often... *looks at size of belly*... Maybe its a good thing I dont live near this place. Awesome Awesome food... Service is meh. But thats ok, the food is so unreal and the selection is great!"}
{"text":"The price is higher here than at other buffets in the area, but it is also a step up in quality and variety. Sushi is decent, not a huge selection, but more than California and Philadelphia rolls. It seems reasonably fresh; there is a sushi chef working behind the line, though of course, the quality is not as good as a dedicated sushi restaurant. Food turnover seems high, as the place is always busy. The hot food is slightly better than typical buffet food, nothing stands out, but nothing is so bad that it bears mentioning. Desserts are terrible, as usual, but that's not surprising."}
{"text":"Great food! I love that there so much choice of seafood dishes. Prices are pretty decent. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"Simply put lunch was great... and a bargain... Trays were kept full and fresh... a woman watched the trays and radioed the kitchen what was needed,  Many items not normally seen on a buffet,,,    I even tried chicken feet,,,,,  also you should try the green tea ice cream.  I will be back anytime I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Always good...  and a great selection...  not white table cloth but IMHO one of the best buffets in the state....  We stop every time we go to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Let's just say, you get what you pay for.  Thankfully we walked in and were seated and walked out after walking through the food lines to see what was being offered.  

The restaurant was dirty and the food appeared disgusting.  The hot food looked like fried sludge.  Sushi appeared as if it had been sitting there too long and just of extreme poor quality and limited offerings.

I would recommend that you go to a sit down restaurant and order quality food.  But then again, if you think that Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral is quality food, then this place might be up your beaten path.  

I've never given a terrible review to anyone, but there is always a first time."}
{"text":"I came here thinking that it was a seafood buffet, you know like in vegas, I went in and look around I was so dissappointed. it was just a chinese buffet with a few seafood, like any chinese buffet, we said thank you for making us drive 30 minutes. we have 2 better chinese buffets in my area, 1 in ahwatukee near 48th and chandler and another one around Baseline and 40th Street, we ended up going to the one in Baseline and 40th street, Bright, newer, alive, with so much food, fried shrimps, all kinds of seafood, even carne asada it was less than 10 dollars instead of the $17 bucks that Pacific Seafood wanted. and way better.   I will never go back here to this \"Pacific non-seafood buffet, they should change their name to \"boring chinese buffet\"    If i could give it zero starts I would but there is no option for it."}
{"text":"This place has nothing to do with it's name, my wife and I drove for 20 miles just to go thinking that it was a seafood buffet, we got there excited with the big sign outside, we go in and ask the cashier if we could see the food she said yes.  it was just a chinese buffet, not just a chinese buffet but a really bad chinese buffet, no variatity, small, plain, the food look dry, we thought it was a seafood buffet, we said thank you and we ended up going to another chinese buffet for half the price and 100 times better, seafood and everything, it was near baseline and 40th street, something like that, there is another chinese buffet around my house in Ahwatukee near 48th street and chandler blvd like 40 times better than this place. overall, change your name owners, this is so confusing with your Pacific seafood buffet name when is totally not like that at all."}
{"text":"Yet another Chinese run seafood buffet.

And the usual large crowd, reasonably cooked (but clearly mass produced) foods, and the abundant choices.  The two-star rating is really for all of this kind of restaurants.  I would probably never volunteer to come, but wouldn't object them either."}
{"text":"my go to restaurant in the valley for seafood buffet.. only on the weekends do they serve snow crab legs.. excellent choice of seafood o me western dishes and western style Chinese food."}
{"text":"I am told that this place started out as a great place to eat. While this may be true, things have certainly changed for Pacific. The whole place smells horribly like fish (Keep in mind that properly prepared fish does not smell fishy.) and the restaurant was gross. I spent my time trying to find something to eat that wouldn't gross me out which was a waste of time. I left terrified that my next few hours would find me hunched over a toilet bowl. Don't go here."}
{"text":"this place is a nightmare!  they let people push ans shove and use their hands on the food it makes me sick even though I stopped going  in Feb of last year!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short:

- The food? Tasty!
- The sushi? Yes, tasty!
- The service? Great! My drink was never empty. 
- The quality? Seemed good-to-high to me. 
- The [lunch] price? Very fair, for what you can get. 

The bottom line, for me, is that this is a GREAT place to go eat lunch if you have the time to sit and feast. Dinner looks even better, but I've only been there for lunch and found the price pretty good."}
{"text":"I met friends there for lunch today. There were four people at our table. One person had already eaten lunch, but wanted to join us for the visit. The waitress clearly saw that this girl did not eat, but the cashier would not take her $10 buffet charge off the bill. The reason she gave us for not taking the $10 charge off the bill was because we didn't inform them when we were seated that she wasn't eating. What a rip off. Very poor public relations! They just lost four customers."}
{"text":"Aweful place , very dirty , the only attraction in the buffet for me was the crab legs and the pan was almost always empty .. went there sunday night and it was a mess the carpet the floor very dirty  the dishes were wet which was disgusting and price is higher on the weekends! Overpriced ! Big time  .. never ever going back again !"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets, but my friends insisted on this place so I decide to give it try. 
Not impressed, very disappointed. In my 30 years in the food industry, this had to be the worst experience! Tasteless food and very unsanitary, I  will defiantly not be returning."}
{"text":"Never eat at this place.
Sign says closes at 9:30, we walk in at 8:59, plenty of time for sushi but are told they close at 9:00, to which I say no...you close at 9:30...she goes outside to look at times and comes back in saying you can look and see what's there is as we started shuting down......Hmmmm no thank you."}
{"text":"Had really hoped this buffet would meet my expectations but sadly it was very disappointing especially since it was Christmas Day.
The main attraction was supposed to be crab legs, but the pan was virtually always empty.  Refills were few and far between, and when they did come if you weren't standing right there, the hoards of heavy weights would attack the offering leaving nothing for you to eat.  It was the same for the spicy crab, crawdads and anything else on that particular food bar.  One would think on a holiday evening with a good crowd the restaurant would keep the various foods full.  My first plate consisted of over cooked octopus, tasty steamed clams, fried whole fish (looked like red snapper and was my favorite of the night), blah coconut shrimp which lacked a coconut taste, over cooked baby bokchoy and a couple of oysters with black bean sauce.  Plate one scored a 2.5 out of 5 for me.  Felt bad for the wife who is not a seafood lover, there was virtually no chicken or beef dishes she could have.  I definitely owe her another dinner somewhere better then this experience.  Time for my second plate, found some type of small fish which was whole and smoked (my second favorite of the night), grabbed the last two crab legs (crab is crab unless your eating king crab at Talking Stick's buffet, they are out of this world), got the last peppered crab, two large snails, 4 raw oysters, one fried shrimp and another scoop of steamed clams to round of my plate.  First time I've eaten snails as large as these.  No flavor, tough would be an understatement, would not try again.  Plate score because of the smoked fish and clams, a 3.  Next I had a bowl of hot and sour soup which other diners virtually took any food solids out and left nearly all broth, score 1. Last plate, number 3 I went back for my few evening favorites, smoked whole fish, fried fish in a light sweet and sour sauce, small scoop of clams and a couple of raw oysters.  Plate score 3.  My last trip was for desert.  The macaroon cookies were excellent as well as the seasame balls.  Score 5.
Overall service was very good at our table, score 4, food quality and availability killed the meal, final score 2.
Guess the old saying applies here:  \"buyer beware\""}
{"text":"I was amazed of the wide variety of Asian food!!
It was all very delicious, nothing sat out long, small portions so they are constantly being made fresh.
It was all VERY VERY delicious food and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is a borderline 2-3 stars. We went here recently for a mix of birthday's and Easter. It was our first time for most people going Pacific Buffet. If you are doing a restaurant based almost solely on seafood, you're really putting yourself out there. This place may have been the spot back in the day but not anymore.

The seafood didn't seem that fresh at all. In some cases, I left some of the food on the plate after trying it since it was either lacking in flavor or had a strange texture to it. Their sushi was okay and you can't really mess up dessert (except for Home Town Buffet) so that was tasty. The service was well though, they did a good job clearing empty plates, but I don't have any plans to eat here again."}
{"text":"Sushi & Sashimi check, Mongolian BBQ check, All you can eat Crab Legs - CHECK!!! Fun, clean and elegant Chinese Buffet ambiance with ample seating even when they are busy.

Now we get to the reason you come here...the buffet tables full of endless Chinese food delights. Appetizers, Shrimp, Hot and Sour Soup, Mussels, and all your typical Chinese buffet dishes. Pacific Seafood Buffet has a great Sushi and Sashimi Bar, of course made fresh with a lot of choices.

All around good buffet, but my one draw back is the price, $19 per person and then you pay for your drinks that's like being in Vegas. My check at $70 for 3 people (not including tip) at a buffet is asking a lot considering what you are getting. That being said, if you want to spend $$ and craving a good Seafood Buffet,  you will want to check out Pacific Seafood Buffet in Glendale, Arizona"}
{"text":"Not bad for Chinese buffet style lunch. The sushi selection was better then the Avondale location but the lunch price was also higher. Overall good lunch- green tea ice cream is so awesome!"}
{"text":"I love buffets. I go to many. So my one star is for the quality of the food here. My friend and I wanted to try a new Chinese buffet and headed over here for our first try.  All the meats tasted nasty. I spit out over half the things I put in my mouth. I ended up not eating a lot of each plate I tried. I am easily pleased usually, but this place really wasn't good. They had tons of variety but the quality was lacking. I would say their best items were their hot and sour soup and their dessert bar. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Pacific Buffet probably has the best variety of food out of the Asian buffets in the valley. The food is of good quality too, so it's definitely worth a try for anyone hankering for seafood/sushi. It's pricier that other buffets such as Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet and Crazy Buffet, but the food tastes better here too."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out after reading some pretty good reviews. For the price it's definitely NOT worth it! I ate some of the sushi rolls (1 out of 5 were decent). Had some salad, fried rice, chx & beef stir fry items then tried the flan & cakes (cakes were the best) clearly not made in house. My husband ate quite a bit of the crab legs which he enjoyed luckily to get our $$ worth. Needless to say very dissappointed and I had the runs the next day. If it weren't for the fresh made to order stir fry and cakes I would have not posted ANY stars."}
{"text":"Okay was totally not feeling  it 2nd time around..it was just not worth it. I guess if you just want to fill up its ok but if you actually want to sit and enjoy very disappointing. The wait help was sweet though. The dishes were wet and a bit oily. The food just wasn't good. the kids didn't like it :("}
{"text":"I actually like this place, for right now anyways. We've been here twice and both times have had positive experiences. Pricey, but wide food selections and sushi was pretty fresh. We tried the Pacific in Chandler many times before and this one is way better! Don't know why people gave less stars when there are more positive factors than negatives. Well, as of this moment to my taste, I think they have good crab legs, hibachi, and sushi bar. They also have flan for desert and I love flan! Service was good, no complaints! Restroom was clean. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was not fresh at all. I had to ask the workers for fresh food. So disappointed. Never going back. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Let me just start with the fact that I'm not big on buffets only because there are so few good ones in the Phoenix area. 

However, this is one of the worst buffets that I've ever been to. I came here with my family for my 15yr old Sons birthday because he requested a buffet. They sat us before I even had time to take a look at around. 

On our way to the table I noticed how dirty the place was. The floor, table and chairs. It only got worse as I made my way to the buffet. 

The food selection was typical for a Asian buffet but the flavor was either tasteless or flat out gross. The only thing I was looking forward to eating was the crab legs, but when I cracked the first one open it smelt like the meat was bad. 

They do have a large sushi selection. I don't know if it tasted good or not because I couldn't bring myself to try it. It might have been how messy the rolls were, or the dirty self serve gallon tubs of wasabi and ginger that turned me away. 

Last but not least, the dessert bar. I've never seen a place where they have scoop your own ice cream with a scooping spoon laying inside the ice cream. Only 500 people dug their hand in the ice cream to get the spoon. My three year old wouldn't even eat the cakes and he loves sweets so much he'd eat strait sugar if I let him. 

Wait! I didn't tell you the best part. After this lovely experience we paid $140 for my family to not eat this meal. 

Yea, It was pretty much on the top 10 list of worst choices we've made for places to eat out. 

Do yourself a favor and don't go here."}
{"text":"This place has dropped of in term of quality tremendously. You know it's bad when every diner in the restaurant turn and look when the staff bring out the crab legs. Seriously 10 crab legs every 20 minutes on a Friday night? Our party got tired of waiting and just eat whatever else was available. 
Two stars because the staff were friendly and did their job. But really this is likely the last time I'm bringing my family to pacific buffet."}
{"text":"Love it! But would definitely make it a lunch meal because dinner prices are pretty high. We go once a week and haven't had any issues yet!"}
{"text":"Clean
Good food
some time it take more than 20  minute for them to add more food,I had to tell them to refill the mongolian beef."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I use to go here all the time. We only did the lunch never the dinner, the dinner seems way too expensive for the quality they put out. But I always eat the sushi here and never get sick. You get what you pay for but I enjoy it."}
{"text":"Rude Staff, Rude Customers, Mediocre to Lousy Food. Not worth $20 per person."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet I've had so far in Arizona. Usually the sushi in buffets is gross but theirs is decent. Not amazing like a real sushi bar but definitely good and actually edible unlike a lot of other places. Love the variety they have and you can find a lot if stuff even if you don't like seafood. Their orange chicken is so good and they have all you can eat grab for dinner. It's expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Time and again, no matter what brand of Asian buffet fare I try, I come back to Pacific.

I cannot tell you the number of terrible experiences I've had - but this place is like an old friend, waiting to welcome me back into a friendly embrace.

The food is always tasty and fresh.  I've never had anything that looks or tastes like it has sat out under a lamp for three hours.  It helps that there is usually a healthy crowd in the restaurant, but none the less - tastiness abounds!

The sushi bar is one of the better ones as far as buffet goes.  There's always a decent selection of your typical fare, with a few creative rolls thrown in.  Dinner brings out the sashimi, which I adore.  Especially the salmon, of which Pacific always has the freshest I've had at any AYCE place.  It melts in your mouth!

I don't spend much time in the hot food section every time I go, but their coconut shrimp is awesome, as is their chicken skewers in the Korean BBQ area.  They also serve custard balls over in the Dim Sum area (next to the Korean space) that are perfect as desert for me.

Bottom line:  If you are in the east valley, this is one of the better places to go to.  I also hear rumor that there is another location somewhere in the Northwest valley, but I can't confirm that.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OK so what did I think of this place. Well first off after reading these reviews I thought, doesn't sound so bad, so what the hell. So tonight my partner and I went there for dinner!

OK this place says its a Seafood Buffet, someone says its like the Rio SeaFood Buffeet  in Vegas, HARDLY! The Rio is in a completely different and A LOT better.

This place is hugh, and if you do not get there by 6pm forget finding a placeto sit  its packed. The food was just OK, when you walk in you see this very large boat serving center, that is where the Sushi is at, nice selection for a buffet, but then again not the best,

They have a section that is like a BBQ area where you pick what you want, and the cooks will cook it for you, a nice selection. They have a meat section its OK, the beek is over cooked, as well as the chicken. They have the same selection of the chinese buffet as any other Chinese Buffet in PHX, in fact there are better places.

There is a lady who brings the food as well as broadcast to the cooks in the back what is needed, the speakers are so loud in the kitchen that it sounded like a train station anouncements in a chinese train station, This same lady \"bumped\" into my many times while she was bring out the new food, I understand that she is in a rush, but when there are people in front of me who is overwhelemed by the selection of food I have no place to go, 

The atmosphere is nice, very airy but very loud, when you have a large gruop of people trying to talk to each other, it gets very loud. The wait staff need help, they take forever to clean away dirty plate and to get refils of your drinks.

So, lets talk about price....  Total for 2 adults with drinks (non alcholoic) was $39. WOW, I couldn't beleive that price. Yes, they serve alcholoic drinks, that is a nice part I saw.

Over all, we wont go back to it, for that pice, I would rather eat some place else. 

Save youself from this pace and go some place else."}
{"text":"Went here for Thanksgiving and had a good time. They had all the normal Thanksgiving turkey with dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes and gravy, plus all the dinner buffet. I had some turkey then filled up with sushi and the bbq section. I like the selection here, it's not serious sit down quality but i think it is the best Asian buffet around the valley. I had clams, crab, seared tuna, bbq pork and beef, seaweed salad, marinated baby squid, fresh oysters, and a few others."}
{"text":"So I came here because a friend wanted to try it out. This is your typical all you can eat low quality Chinese junk food. Obviously, this is more catered for people that are trying to win the \"who has the shortest lifespan\" competition. The meat quality is horrible. I could tell these meats were frozen for a long time- I'd say at LEAST a month (bought in bulk). I've been dragged to a few variations of these cheap Chinese buffets and feel like they all order from the same food supplier somewhere in China I bet. I highly recommend this place if you are really hung over from last night and need to gorge yourself out or just ran an ultra-marathon and want to replenish your body with oil and grease. +1 because the waiters there are very very very hard workers. Oh, I'll pay you 5 bucks to eat their sashimi."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Went for dinner.  Thought it was a little pricey but I have to say the house lost on this deal!  Definitely will go back.  Sushi was fresh, buffet items were hot and constantly rotating. Huge selection from chicken feet to sushi to pizza."}
{"text":"Good selection of food, sushi was better than average for one of these buffets. I also really likes the Korean BBQ. Service was good and my ice tea stayed full. I'll be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is your typical pan-asian/seafood all-you-can-buffet. They have chinese dishes (Orange chicken...stir-fried green beans...mongolian beef  and korean dishes like Kalbi and bbq ribs.) They offer crab legs which is a huge customer favorite, people wait for a fresh batch around the food aisle. They also have sushi & sashimi options. Personally, I'm not a huge sushi person but they have california rolls and other varieties that are fairly good. 

There's definitely a little for everyone. They have a mini-hibachi grill where you can pick your ingredients and have someone stir-fry it. They have a wide dessert selection but most look better than they taste. Most of their cakes look store bought but for most part, you're too full to eat dessert. 

It's a fairly large space, good for big groups. 

Dinner prices on a weekend are around $16.99 which is pretty cheap for a buffet."}
{"text":"First time here. We stopped in during the week for lunch. Wow! Ten dollars for an all you can eat buffet up until 4pm. 

The interior is nice enough with booths and tables available. The carpet is a bit worn and the restaurant feels like it needs some renovation. 

Service was good. We were greeted and taken to a table right away. A server came by and took our drink order then off to check out the numerous items on the buffet!

They have everything and then some! There is seriously too many things to try on one visit. Quite a selection with a sushi bar and habachi grill. There is a salad bar, soups, desert bar and an area with hard ice cream. Wish there were more labels for everything so we knew what we were eating. 

Good to go when you want to try some new things or pig out on old favorites!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese buffet I will go to in AZ. On the weekends can be a little pricey but worth it because they have crab legs and a good sushi selection! The quality of this buffet beats every buffet in AZ. Pacific seafood buffet has became a staple in my book!"}
{"text":"Lets go to Pacific. Its been a while since we have eaten there. We used to go all the time. It should be great. Not.

Our family has been going to Pacific for years. Always enjoying the quality and variety of food at very fair price. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. We visited on a Saturday afternoon. So the prices are fixed at about $20 per person for all the food you can eat and a drink. 

We arrive to a fairly clean restaurant. The great smells coming from everywhere. The place is fairly busy. We get seated really fast and we go out to start sampling everything. I am a big fan of crab puffs and always hit those first. There sits a HUGE pile of them ready for my picking. However, as I get closer they look a little flat. As I start placing them on the plate they are very very light. I go back to my table to eat them. Nothing. What the? I pull them apart. I had 4 fancy folded and fried wontons. NOTHING inside them. No cream cheese no crab. Just the same air I live and breathe for free. Well that is a gyp.

And were are our drinks we ordered when we sat down? We had to wait for them to come for a while. I had the iced tea and my husband a diet pepsi. The tea tasted funny. Like not changing a filter or cleaning spouts funny. No amount of sweetener would fix it. 

Moving on to the mains. Such a variety of sushi! I grab different kinds. Then walk over to the dikon carrot salad. Sit down and take a bite of this amazing looking sushi. Do NOT judge a sushi by its look. I took a bite and it tasted AWEFUL. I tried to take a closer look to what was inside. I really could not make anything out. Whatever the combination it was not working. Well maybe its just this piece. Let me try the tamago (egg). No no no. What a weird flavor. Tamago is supposed to be sweet. This was almost rancid. Had to spit that one out. Ah good old inari zushi. Plain old rice in a tofu pocket. No, they messed that up too. WTF!! All my sushi choices were uneatable. Let me cleanse my palet with the ginger. Once piece and it tasted like it was soaking in cleaning fluid! ACK!!! I can't win!

Wait! They are bringing out more crab! Yay! Let me get over there before its all gone. Even the first pick over of a fresh tray was horrible. The legs looked like they were torn off of the thinnest spindly starved crabs on the planet. What species of crab is this? Almost no meat at all. Even the \"claws\". I use that term loosely. More like needle nose pliers and just as tough. Just sinew. And a color red that is not in nature. A deep dark red. Almost brown covered these super-skinny legs. And the shells were chewy. Rubbery. You had to twist and use your fork like an old fashioned can opener to get to the sinew inside. Did not enjoy my one leg of sinew. Bleh.

I did get a few strands of the bbq pork that was well made. The meet was a little tough but flavorful. And my daikon salad was ok. But how can you mess up daikon and carrot and vinegar? And my pineapple pieces I had for desert were good too. The whole three I could stomach.

So we go to pay. Over $45 for the two of us. Maybe eating a whole $10 worth of decent food between us. I feel like I got totally screwed here. Totally not worth that amount of money. They really need to fix a plentiful plate of problems before I ever go back there. You have been warned."}
{"text":"The one time I ate here, I was so violently sick, I wanted to die. It is really dirty as well. I have no idea how they are still open."}
{"text":"Last time I will go there. Food was awful and not recommended. Service was horrible and kind of over priced. Would have been okay if the food had been good or fresh. Stay away"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection for a buffet, and the sushi selection was good for a buffet. They even had sashimi, which is very rare for a buffet. We went at dinner, so they had the full dinner selections including crab legs."}
{"text":"Always delicious and always fresh. The best buffet in the valley. Come early to avoid the dinner rush or you could wait over an hour for a table."}
{"text":"I've gone to  different buffets and this is one of my favorites honestly don't care so much for the food I just love the Sushi and the variety they have with the sushi the only thing I really eat out of the buffet is the crab rangoons and one other foods I don't know what it's called. I do like the deserts mainly just the ice cream I like the variety to choose."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is about the only buffet I can enjoy anymore. All the others have put a fear into me for one reason or another. However, I was compelled to try Pacific Seafood. It sounded so coastal even though I knew it would largely be a Chinese buffet with the usual lo mein and beef and broccoli cooked in 40 weight oil. These dishes were there, however, the sushi was very good for a buffet and had a decent selection. Nothing beats a good sushi bar with it being made right there to order but this wasn't bad. The grilled items were very good also. Pork chops, bbq ribs, and grilled zucchini. The crab legs looked good but never had a chance to try them. As soon as they filled the empty vat, Somebody who obviously felt they were more important and deserving than everyone else would walk off with most of them and the person behind him scrounged what was left. Maybe next time. Desert was good-real ice cream and a selection of cakes and cookies. Our server was very attentive also. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that at buffet restaurants, the servers either fall over each other trying to serve your every need or they all but ignore you. This day, it was good. 
 In the buffet category, I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I cant believe this place is just averaging 3 and a half stars. To start with it is my new favorite chinese buffet in the valley..It just topped my number one choice which was Jen buffet (another great buffet).The food here is just as good as Jen but i think the BBQ section  threw them over the top. From roast duck to breakfast sausage on a stick every thing is very taste.This restaurant is beautiful and well laid out. The food choices are so many you would never be able to try them all( But i enjoyed trying).They also have Mongolian BBQ,fresh sushi,4 different soups and 8 different hard ice cream choices.This place rocks and should never get less than 5 stars.So if your on the hunt for a good chinese buffet i would strongly recommend pacific seafood buffet."}
{"text":"well this one beats the other one in Chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer atmosphere. Everything I ate was real good from the creamy clam chowder to the desserts.This is my new favorite Chinese buffet in Arizona.A couple of things wrong were,my cake was still frozen and all the trays were not out at opening. They are new with new staff so I hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great buffet experience and I am going to put them on my top ten list for buffets."}
{"text":"Your one-stop-shop for pretty much anything your buffet pallet could want. Their sushi bar has a fairly wide selection of rolls and other items like squid and seaweed salad. The far back wall is a teppanyaki station and they even have an ice box with self serve ice cream. The main floor is dominated by the usual buffet fare but they have some tasty dim sum selections near the salad bar. Snow crab legs are the usual attention-grabber right up front so go during off-peak meal times if you want a couple plates right away.

Servers are always friendly and never turn away customers. We once had a late night and showed up 45 minutes before closing but the staff on the floor offered to cook more clams for me! I politely declined as I got what I needed but the thought it what counts."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this restaurant. Overall the venue was very dirty. The tables looked like they had not been polished or touched-up in years. The Chinese food was decent, but the seafood was below average. 
It's labeled as a buffet, but the portions they put out at a time are very small. There was always a line for the snow crab legs and they were gone within minutes of being brought out. 
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good.  I like the selection they have for dinner on the weekends.

The prices are pretty steep though.

I'd go here again if I come across some extra dough."}
{"text":"Came for my brother birthday. My mother in law recommended this place. Half of us ate sushi the other half ate other stuff so this place is good for that. Clean inside but you get those guest that throw things on the floor. Over all it's a good place"}
{"text":"So I come to this buffet very often, usually with my mother, however tonight I came with my whole entire family to enjoy a nice Sunday evening as they've never been to this buffet before. As we came in, the hostess, Michael, stood up and looked at us quite weirdly, i assumed it was because we were this large sum family, ( mind you we're a mexican/hispanic family speaking spanish quite loudly, so i can see how it could be quite intimidating having a large group walk in) my family told him it is 7 of us adults with 2 kids, we knew the costs, as there was list of prices. Yet he just stood there staring And then, quite rudely said \"it's 17.89 per person.\" We said okay.. (Not really caring for we knew what we were gonna pay). Then said it again, as if we weren't comprehending or as if we weren't able to afford it. We felt it was quite rude and unnacceptable. My mother and I never had encountered such behavior, yet this first impression left the rest of my family unhappy with this buffet. Yes the food is great, that's what we love, yet the behavior like this makes the place as a whole look bad. I hope no one else receives this kind of behavior."}
{"text":"The buffet here is quite nice.  Comparable to the decent Asian ones I used to frequent in Houston.  I'm not really much of a buffet person though so take my review as  you wish.  Lots of variety, ate my favorite seafoods, didn't get sick afterward.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot for lunch since it's not a far drive from work. But now I actually have friends to eat with and we do the democratic thing and vote so this place never made it to the top of the pops. Anyway, one time we were voting and some scary hole-in-the-wall stray-cat-serving buffet type place was mentioned and I refused to go. I'd rather eat at our workplace cafeteria than there! I know a better place if we're doing the buffet thing, I told them. Of course, better doesn't mean a whole lot when it comes to buffets. So we ended up here and everyone got their fill. One dude went to town. One dude wouldn't eat anything where the food was labelled only in Chinese. The rest ate normally. I avoided the sushi. Never know when you're gonna get Chairman Mao's revenge. Yeah I know - TMI. Lunch offerings don't usually include the crab legs, escargot, crawfish, frog legs, and some other stuff that would make most kids go EWWWWWWWWW! Ok, maybe some adults too. You can usually get those items at dinner though. But it's pretty much Chinese buffet usual suspects. Some sushi as well. We were sitting at the north end of the restaurant and we all noticed some unholy odor after a while. We all pointed at each other in \"who cut the cheese\" fashion but really, it was coming from the restaurant. Lotsa parking - it's in a mall just north of the northwest corner of Arizona Ave and Elliot Rd. You're mileage, as always, may vary."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday for the first time.  The entire staff was friendly, and for a full buffet, the $10/person it cost was very reasonable.  The sushi was freshly made and tasted good.  They had a somewhat limited supply of rolls when I went, but what they had was tasty.  The grill food was quite good, and the Chinese buffet food was about as good as any normal Chinese buffet.  The crab puffs were no good(they had what seemed like no crab in them) and the mussels were not fantastic, but all in all good food and a fine experience."}
{"text":"I was shocked at the state of this restaurant, It went from being a classier buffet to really rundown and dingy. We were told that it would be 15 mins. only to wait for over an hour, and to be offered a café table/side table, their words. The quality of the food was subpar and service was not very good.  I loved this restaurant, and it was always fun, not any more.  I used to recommend this place to friends.  I will not be doing that any more."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to what I thought was going to be a very nice seafood buffet style dinner. But it turns out that it was almost identical to Golden corral. My server was OK although  she only spoke two words to us which was \"thank you\" at the end. Honestly, I have low expectations, but for $43 for only two people with food and soda, I think that's a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"So so. I guess. The food really wasn't that great. Plus, some little kid coughed right on me."}
{"text":"The selection at this buffet is great but overpriced.  Be prepared to grab plates of crab legs when it's available since it takes them a while to bring out more.  Floors are gross and the restrooms are not maintained.  The hosts are rude and they do not even say welcome. They just ask how many and you are to assume that you know to follow them. The servers are not friendly either. They will refill your water and take away your plates but not say anything to you.  Often, you can see the wait staff standing around pointing and laughing at customers.  Very rude."}
{"text":"Came here about a year ago. It was ok then and the crab legs were decent and the variety is nice. Unfortantly this last trip is our last the food was just gross to put it bluntly crab legs were slimy and dry weird. Service not with any smiles seriously not friendly at all. I'm sure it's not the language barrier!! To top it off the faculty, the floor, the bathrooms... no maintaince we should have just bases it on that and just walked away. Will not come back beware they are in serious need of a overhaul in management customer service and faculty upgrades. No way I would pay that amount again for this type of service"}
{"text":"Last time came here waiting for the crab legs 30 minutes, today, waiting for the crab leg 45 minutes and very salty"}
{"text":"Not really thinking highly of buffets already, I didn't go into this place expecting fine dining. It was just a place where the family could get together and everyone could get something they liked. Not being from around here, I was up for trying something different. The buffet seemed small, but had plenty of variety. I was surprised by the variety of sashimi they had to offer, not just tuna and salmon. They had creative rolls that were decent. SKIP THE RAW OYSTERS! I didn't touch the king crab, but people were walking away with towering crab legs on their plate. The crawdads were good. The rest of the buffet was the usual salad island, fried rice/stir fry noodles, stir fried veggies station. Then they had a variety of soups. I just want to hurry to dessert so I could get some ice cream. They had a good range of flavors, even green tea. 

It's nice that the bar has a tv so you could watch sports. 

This place is worth coming back to, but I'll see what else the desert has to offer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in the valley. They always have fresh food, everything is well stocked. My family always end up here when we can't decide where to go!"}
{"text":"Great Buffett.  Huge selection.  Its listed as Chinese, but it's really more of a Pacific Rim type place, with the offerings divided between Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese.  Tasty food in an all you can eat format.  I love seafood, so I spend most of my food intake budget on the Snow Crab Legs, Crawfish, and a variety of non-fried Shrimp options.  Really good sushi bar with lots of fresh-rolled options.  Grilled meat options and Mongolian BBQ to order as well.  We are a family of 6 and my 4 kids love the place.  Its their favorite place to eat, and we enjoy family feasts here every few weeks or so.  Friendly staff.  There can be a bit of a wait on weekend evenings, so eat off-peak or plan accordingly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves buffets so here we are. We came here right after they opened and the food was ok then. Actually it was better then because in the time they have been open they have raised their prices & when we went tonight we paid over $15.00 per adult and that didn't include a drink. Buffets are cheap to feed the kids when they are with us & they get a variety of food. If you're a big fan of crab legs & some of the other \"fancy\" things they have I suppose it's worth the money. I on the other had preferred sushi at a restaurant not a buffet so I stick to the simple items that are just as good at a place that charges $8.99. Don't get me wrong, the food is good it's just overpriced in my opinion. The restaurant itself is very nice & clean and they do have a variety of food to choose from. I wish they had some coupons that would make me feel better about dining here again!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting to say the least! How are they still in business? So disgusting... everything is COLD and the food was terrible!"}
{"text":"This place was the only buffet i could find where reviews said they had crab legs, they were wrong. The food here looked and smelled good, but was very dissatisfying. Even the jello was subpar. How is that? I gove two stars bc the sushi was tolerable. Dont recommend this place. I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious sea food, I like this place a lot, flavor and food is good and fresh, service is good too.
One of my to go places."}
{"text":"Not at bad overall buffet but have had better.   For those that like seafood a good spot to pig out. Otherwise may want to go to a typical Chinese buffet place due to the price.

Goods:
-Sushi was freshly made and pretty good variety. 
-Great seafood variety, crab, snails, fish, oysters, shrimp......
-Nice selections of ice creams :-) 
-Has Mongolian, Chinese (Dim Sum too), Japanese, 

Bads:
-Place is old, needs updating
-Feels a bit dirty
-Pricey: basically $20 out the door"}
{"text":"My friends seem to like this place but sorry folks, it's pretty poor food and not very good quality.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times and the food was okay. I like that you can make your own plate and they cook it for you. My husband got horrible food poisoning from here though, probably because the food is not always hot and who knows how long it has sat out. Sometimes the fish looks like it's been sitting a while, maybe that was the culprit. I really wish there was a good Chinese buffet around. I got excited because this one is supposed to serve more authentic Chinese food (and there is A LOT of selection and a lot of different food), but I don't trust eating it after it made my husband sick. Maybe it depends on when you go - I have never been for dinner, or during busy periods."}
{"text":"They have quite a selection of dishes here.  Decent for a buffet.  Actually, one of the better 'Chinese' food buffets.  If you ever go during prime-time there's always a line waiting for the snow crab legs & throngs of Asians.  I really like their steamed clams, but I like most clams.  The sushi........ neh.  It's alrite, but if that's what u're goin for, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I love eating at this buffet, mostly for the crab legs because they are so very good and I love the location."}
{"text":"So disgusting!  Dry, smelly food and overpriced. Please you would be happier with a bag of dog food.  We are all feeling sick after eating there tonight!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and the food was cold and honestly not that great and 4 hours later he was throwing up because he got food poisoning. I 10/10 do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Bordering on 3.5.  It's all you can eat sushi and seafood for $16.

The sushi was bland and dry.  The crab legs and cocktail shrimp were the best things here. They also have fried crab, fried shrimp, scallop on the shell, cooked salmon/white fish, bbq pork, short ribs, roasted duck, sausage, Korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and grilled octopus.

For dessert, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies -- all mediocre. This place is fine for the price and selection, but I doubt you're coming here for quality.  Next time, spandex pants."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today and it is a decent place with cheap prices. it is one of the best cheap buffet places I have ever been to. their sushi is not bad as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a fan of Asian and Seafood Buffets so when we moved to AZ we hoped we'd find one we really liked.  Pacific Seafood did not disappoint.  They have a ton of variety on their menu.  The food is consistently being brought out.  The food is hot and fresh and taste great.  We love most the variety, how often they bring out crab legs and the sushi bar. Also the restaurant is well kept, clean and spacious.  So far one of our fave family spots."}
{"text":"This seafood place was good, but not the best. The best food out of all they have is their sushi and sashimi. There is also some Chinese food, noodles, wonton soup, crab legs, chicken feet and a dessert table. There are 8 ice cream flavors and you get everything yourself. The food is all asian. The staff was nice and there was lots of room inside, but I would say the food is just good, it's not great. It's about $17 a person for weekends."}
{"text":"I came in tonight with my dad and kids who were super excited to eat at such a nice place. At first glance the place is beautiful! I have been a restaurant manager for 17 years. This is my very first yelp review. The reason I am even writing this is because I feel the person behind this vision was onto something great and it still could be! I feel bad. Someone dumped probably 2 to 3 million dollars into this vision. It looks as if they walked away or got overwhelmed with running a restaurant. 

the possitive-food was amazing, decor is beautiful, i see amazing potential for this restaurant.

the areas of opportunity-food was cold, manager was not emathetic and kindly suggested my pallet was not registering the heat of the food and assured me it was safe to eat even if it was cold, price was too high(when people go to a buffet, they are looking for value), wait staff never checked back.

My proffesional Suggestions-

Drop the crab legs and lower the price. Buffet is a value perception.

Empower managers who care. If they don't, replace them.

Invest in maintenance. Carpet cleaning, repair blinds, equipment that keeps hot food hot and cold food cold.

The passion was once in this restaurant. The vision is clear. The execution leaves much to be desired. 

EVEN MY KIDS WERE DISAPOINTED IN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE FOOD."}
{"text":"Wow, This place is horrible!  I have been to a few Asian seafood buffets and none have been good but this one was over the top awful. Small crab, and all of the food that should be hot was cold and tasted horrible. The so called sushi section made me ill just looking at it. Tried a couple basic generic rolls and the were worse then they looked. Probably the worst salmon sashimi I have ever had.   Ever. In short, I cannot understand how this place ever gets a repeat customer."}
{"text":"One of the very best places in town.   Fill up on crab, crawfish, sushi, it's like freaking Disneyland inside.  Whoever I'm with has to drag me out while I pitch a fit and start crying.  Seriously, go there and thank me later.  Be sure to tip the sushi guy!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes with about 50 people on a Sunday evening.. all i can say is WORTH THE WAIT & THE PRICE 

The service is great the food comes out fast and they are constantly cleaning the buffet areas (cause we are all pigs!). The selection is everything from BBQ chicken and fries to a sushi & tempora stand, Mongolian wok, plenty of sea food, crab legs, 15 different kinds of shrimp, all you favorite Chinese buffet items, and some strange surprises. Escargot(snails) and lotus bean leaf wraps, squid, octopus, kimchi Duck, muscles, clams, asparagus. over 200 items. 

Dessert is from fresh fruit, canned fruit, pastries cookies cakes AND 8 self scoop BRYERS ice cream flavors! 

cons, The need some form of table waiting buzzer systems & they need pics for the escargo and crab legs. other than that perfect."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff, love the variety. Make your own noodle bowl is a nice option and the sushi is pretty darn good. Prompt service with clearing plates and refilling glasses.

It's a simple place with nice variety of Asian foods."}
{"text":"Pacific Seafood Buffet does not disappoint. So far, this is the best Asian buffet that I have gone to in greater phoenix. 

I tried their nigiri sushi. I like the maguro, hamachi and their squid was decent. Their rolls are okay. I didn't like the shrimp tempura stuffing, it felt soggy and stale. The best in that section was the marinated whole baby octopus. They were fun to eat and well seasoned. We also enjoyed something that looked like fried scallops, not quite sure. The cold tofu with seaweed was also cool, nice and smooth and well dressed.

The miso soup was okay. The size of the tofu was a little clunky, but I am picking on minutia. I loved the mild fish ball soup with the stuffed fish balls. I am a total fan. I didn't try any of the other soups.

On the grilled meats, I enjoyed the kalbi short ribs and grilled pork on a stick.

Try the Hunan chicken. The lo mein was standard. The green beans were not wilted enough. The beehoon noodles was a nice addition. I did not try the fried rice.

I did not try the Mongolian barbecue.

I was disappointed that they did not have more savory dishes on the dim sum front. They had different kinds of sweet buns stuffed with sesame paste, red bean, taro, sweet potato. They had a siew mai, but I was disappointed they did not have a char siu pao. They surprised me with the fong zhao or braised chicken's feet.

I loved, loved, loved the sauteed clams with garlic and chives. Yum! 

Dessert were meh looking, so I stuck with the sweet steamed buns.

Tip: Lunch prices are $11. Dinner prices are $18. I know there is probably more seafood at night, but there were tonnes of options during the day."}
{"text":"Since dozens of my reviews have disappeared from Yelp, I'm adding this one again.  This spot was a regular for our family although dinner has gone up and is now around $16.  My husband loved the fresh Sashimi and I loved the all you can eat crab.  You have to be quick because all the crab disappears in a few minutes and it takes a while to get it refilled.  There's fresh fruit, cheap desserts which I didn't really care for, and there were enough dishes to make everyone happy."}
{"text":"I must start by saying I am a 22 year veteran of the restaurant business. I do not usually write a review without stating that fact. OK I get it it is a buffet.....Now what i KNOW. There was not 5 items on the buffet that met the temperature requirements of the health department. I think there were 5 soups so thats why I say 5 items. NOTHING else was....major health issue waiting to explode."}
{"text":"Since my husband is a Chinese Buffet Junkie, I took him yesterday for Father's Day.  It was a crazy long wait (20 minutes morphed into 40) no doubt attributable to the day. What I found interesting is the charge was $1 higher than the \"normal\" price of dinner - make all the money you can...right?  Dinner was okay and I mean just okay.  The wait staff were friendly and kept our table clean and drinks filled.  The food stations were clean - the food was hot, and with the exception of the crab legs was replenished before empty.  Don't know if I'll go back though as I left with a very bad impression.  I overheard the manager arguing with a patron regarding a coupon.  Apparently the manager only wanted to apply the coupon to one person instead of the entire party, and the man was telling him to read his own sign which didn't limit it's use.  So sad and incredibly stupid!  You know the saying: Bad news travels while good news stays at home!  This bad news has grown feet and is now on it's way!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints at all!! There is a wide variety an is fresh an hot!! Staff is polite and is very helpful!#"}
{"text":"This place is epic!! So full!! Fresh!! Sushi is so good and fresh crab legs are my new friend !! Waiters the best!! Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Sticker shock alert.

Sweet and sour chicken was cold and tasted weird, no bread, halfway blocked fire exits, even the fortune cookies were low quality.



20 bucks per adult
12 bucks for a 10 year old.
10 bucks for an 8 year old.
4 bucks for sodas...each.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"ok, it's a good buffet, much better than average, but I would stay away from the raw fish and shellfish."}
{"text":"Chicken feet prepared 2 ways, frog legs, escargot......Pacific Seafood Buffet does it all.   I did not try them.  Huge variety of Asian and Asian-inspired food from Japan, China, Korea, and other cultures.  Hits: Chinese spare ribs, sesame balls, orange chicken, steamed pot stickers.  Misses: shrimp on a stick (very odd taste - I suppose they are supposed to taste that way but it's not for me!,) Korean short ribs (too dry/chewy, baked salmon (overdone/dry), maguro sashimi (cut thick and maybe not from the best grade tuna),   I give it 4 stars for the wide variety of food choices - there is something for everyone!  I give it 2.5 stars for the food.   The sushi/sashimi table (not the food) rates 5 stars - it's an amazing carved giant boat.  So overall 3 stars. Lots of people but wait staff handled them very well.  There is also a teppan room to the side."}
{"text":"Dinner is very good. $17. But more sushi options, sashimi, and roast beef makes it worth it if you are hungry.
For lunch and dinner, They have the normal Chinese selections but also have some Korean type food like kal-bi. It is a little dry but still ok for non-Korean place.
They have two types of ribs which are pretty tasty.

With scoops of ice cream, cakes, and cookies, dessert selection is solid.

I try to go for lunch every other week, because at $9.88 it takes care of the sushi, Korean, and ribs craving all at once."}
{"text":"I don't get to Glendale much but this place was very good for a lunch buffet. Only $9.88 (see pic for prices). They had a tray of salmon skin which is my favorite (see pic). Few selections of nigiri, cut rolls, and even some hand rolls. Normal selection of Chinese food but also had dim sum which most of these buffets do not. Korean kal-bi was pretty good. I have to check out the Chandler one some day to see how it compares. For the price and the selection, I think this is the best Asian/Chinese buffet. Sure the Korean food is not as good as an only Korean restaurant but overall very satisfying."}
{"text":"Hearing more Chinese and Vietnamese than English means this spot is legit in our community. I was surprised to see so many people after 7pm on a Sunday night. Get your money's worth by feasting on the crawfish and crab, both very popular items. Stand your ground and fend off hungry asian mobsters. Don't let their age fool you, those grandmas/pas will attack you with the serving spoons if you are in their way. 

Most of the other food items fall between OK to good. However, there were a few questionable-lookingitems that I preferred to leave in their serving trays. Several sushi options, typical americanized chinese options, soups, meats, seafood, a Mongolian BBQ station, and self-serve ice cream freezer.  The advantage of this buffet is obviously quantity over quality, so come with that in mind. The price is $17 for a dinner weekend but you can bring the coupon from their website to save a little bit."}
{"text":"You must come here on Saturday mornings to get the $10 special price.  Then it is most certainly a worthwhile experience.  The hot food here is delicious.  There are plenty of exotic delicacies like crab legs.  And all the basics are here too.  There are also some standouts: pineapple rice which is served in an actual pineapple.  If you see it you MUST try it.  It is the perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness.  Also, the korean glass noodles are fabulous.  And the barbecue station never disappoints.  There is more than enough variety to make everyone happy.  The sushi and dessert selection is so so, and it gets a star off for that.  But the green tea ice cream can usually save the day.  The staff is always super friendly and you can definitely come here with a group and have a great time."}
{"text":"At first I thought oOoh sushi and seafood buffet! Yay to all you can eat sushi and seafood for the cheap price of $15.88 ....then when I went to get my food - I took a look at the sushi station - hmMmM  it's a Wednesday night and not very busy...those rolls and sashimi looks like they've been out on the plate for a while.....ehhh maybe it won't be too bad....so I decided to get just a few salmon and mackeral sashimi and one - what looks like a yellowtail handroll.However, they have a pretty good selection of other foods - the seafood section had crawfish, king crab legs, fried crab, shrimp, periwinkle, scallop salad on the shell and cooked salmon....I tried a little of each and besides the periwinkle, the other is pretty good. The sushi/sashimi I had, however was not so good -- the salmon sashimi was warm, so was the mackeral sashimi, and the one hand roll I had was not really edible - it was chewy and I was a bit afraid to eat the fish cause it didn't seem so fresh after all. So I steered clear of the raw stuff - especially when it's not a busy lunch/dinner time and when it looks like they have been sitting there for awhile - I think the problem was that they didn't put ice underneath the plates that served the sashimi and the lights above it really warmed it up. 

The other food sections they had were meats - bbq pork, short ribs (good taste but chewy), roasted duck, sausages, korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and some grilled octopus and zucchini. and some other food sections you'll see normally at this type of Asian buffet. 

As I walked around I noticed that they had a whole fridge of Dryers Ice Cream - 6 different flavors of ice cream...not that soft frozen yogurt stuff they have at most buffets...now I was looking forward to dessert! hehe The dessert section was fancy too - they had chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies but none tickled my taste buds like the cookies n cream and mint chocolate chip ice cream I had. ;) 

Overall this place was, to my surprise, not bad at all.....for $16 bucks I had a pretty satisfying meal. the service was nice - gave me a refill on my drink before I even finished my first one...and was quick to clear out the plates."}
{"text":"Pacific Buffet is a SEAFOOD ORGASM restaurant. I was very surprised with the choices of authentic food from escargot to frogs legs but not my favorite. They do offer variety of Chinese dishes in the buffet line and a salad bar. The sushi bar is awesome, it shaped like a boat. Bring a hungry stomach because you can get full fast by just eating sushi. The price is a little up there but it's worth it for a special occasion. The crab legs tray gets empty fast by hungry patrons but it gets replenished quickly. Make sure to try the Hibachi grill. You can pick and choose fresh ingredients and the chef will cook it in front of you. 

If you want to try something new or just wanting eat to all you can eat crab legs. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was our first and last visit. The wait time was approx. 20-25 min and ran over but we stuck it out because we expected a wait with the Grand Opening sign out front and the number of people piling up in the cramped lobby area but from reading these posts this place has been opened for quite some time. When we got seated we watched as 3 servers walked on by us ignoring the check on the table and proceed to help the larger parties instead. Ten min. later we finally got the attention of one of the servers to put in our drink order and then we were off to discover the buffet area on our own. We heard him ask other guests around us if it was there first time at the restaurant and proceed to let them know where everything is at and what they should expect to find. I guess he was more concerned with the tips from the larger parties. Well, the food was either bland, not available or had been sitting in the tray for too long. The crab legs were obsolete each time I checked and when I got them they were tasteless and were not cooked right, they did not have the doohickeys to crack them open either. The Won Ton Soup never got refilled so I was not able to try that, it would probably would have been the best part of the dinner because even the dessert tasted funny. Maybe by the time I tried the dessert I already had a bad taste in my mouth or a person has finally found a way to screw up jell-o.! Last thing, the bathroom was disgusting, it looked like no one had checked it all day because they were out of hand soap and toilet paper. Was not expecting another buffet place because from the street you see Hibachi and Sushi in big letters but once you get to park right in the middle is seafood buffet. There was no hibachi and hardly any sushi. Total let done for sure and definitely worth $15.88 a person for dinner."}
{"text":"At first glance everything looked pretty good. But most of the food was cold, not lukewarm, but cold. You expect that buffet food isn't going to be piping hot all the time, but this was ridiculous. Upon telling our waitress, she offered a bunch of excuses. She took 2.57 off our bill as a discount for us mentioning the cold food. We ordered hot tea, flavorless. She had brought a teapot, but only one cup. We asked for another cup to use and were charged an extra dollar for that. Bathroom walls are disgustingly dirty...bloody boogers and all. Sushi was just ok. 

Overall, very disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Tonight we thought we'd try the buffet as we had heard wonderful things from friends.  I am SO glad I did not read the reviews (at least on Google reviews) before dining.  Staff was so friendly.  Cheese won ton and crispy fried shrimp were awesome.  The egg drop & hot & sour soup were superb   We ate everything from Mongolian beef to spicy Tilapia w/veggies, a Mongolian Grill (U don't get to choose/make u're sauce for the cooking), beef short ribs, full salad bar, huge sushi selection, snow crab legs, and a few exotic items. I saw pig snouts, chicken feet and frog legs.  Our drinks were refilled, extra napkins brought intermittently and dirty/finished plates picked up in a timely manner.  The food was actually steaming consistently and the choc chip mint ice cream tasted jusT like an Andes Mint.  The restaurant was packed and had a semi full lobby waiting to be seated. It was Friday night at 4:30pm when we arrived and very few people were there.  Leaving at 7:30 it was completely full.  It was $20 each was a little higher priced as seafood wasn't in abundance to warrant that price.  However, w/all that said, I definitely would return but this would have to be a monthly or every other month choice because of the cost per person & the number of people in our family.  Great job tonight, TYVM!!"}
{"text":"Pacific is still my favorite buffet outside of Las Vegas. They have an excellent selection of seafood and other assortments. They are pretty on top of keeping things restocked especially on the weekends when it is busier. If they are out of something just ask someone who works there when they are refilling it ( usually there is someone walking around checking on things). This is one of the better sushi bars I have seen for a buffet and it is pretty tasty. The staff is friendly and fast at refilling drinks and picking up plates. The price is a little higher than most but you get so much more to choose from plus decent sushi/sashimi, crab legs, and salt and pepper crab. If you know of a better seafood/Asian buffet around here please let me know because I have yet to find one."}
{"text":"All you can eat buffet!  What a great place.  Roomy seating that is clean and comfortable.  

Really went tonight for the crab legs and was not disappointed.  The crab legs were meaty and tasted fresh.  The rest of the Chinese buffet food was plentiful and tasted very good.  The wait staff served with a smile.

The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is that the egg drop soup tasted a little funky and the wait staff were just a little slow removing the dirty plates from our table.

A great experience and I look forward to many more visits.

Adult Dinner 15.88 w/o tax."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Their dinner includes crawfish clams crab legs and more. I also come here for lunch with friends and the overall pricing is good for what you get."}
{"text":"I went here today with a buddy of mine for lunch and it was definitely a very good meal. Overall quality was pretty damn good. The thing I loved the best about this place was that they have duck on the buffet line!! I have never seen this before and I love duck!! The sushi was OK, nothing spectacular, but I didn't expect anything less for buffet sushi. Would I go back? Yeah, I would go back."}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh! Seemed like a carry over from lunch. We came in at 5:30 and nothing was freshly cooked!"}
{"text":"Of the non-casino buffets in the Valley, this one is my current favorite. It is big and spacious, and the quality and variety of the food is very good. While I can go on about how well-prepared the seafood, poultry, and vegetable dishes are, one thing that stood out for me is that they offer grilled fish - which I really love and which I don't recall seeing in any of the Valley buffets. The sushi, while not on par with those in sushi restaurants, is quite good nevertheless. As with most super buffets, there is a really wide variety of offerings, so I know that I will be making several visits here to be able to try all. And even after having done that, repeat visits will follow;  the quality of the dishes ensures that."}
{"text":"Hey!  I haven't been to a buffet in a couple of years.  I would say the last time was the holiday buffet at Verona Chophouse a few Christmases ago.  But on Sunday I had a wild hair to try some place different that also had seafood on the menu.  Well, do they have seafood?  A lot!  Mr. M and I made a couple of trips and tried little bits of all kinds of things, and I think we still didn't even taste half of the offerings.  Everything was really good, from the little stuffed shrimp to the sautéed bok choy to the chicken wings to the donuts to the soup to the dumplings.  Oh yeah!  And neither of us eat sushi or sashimi, but if a person does I could see this being such a great deal.  

Sunday's prices are something like $16.88/person all day and it was well worth it.  I also had a coupon and had printed the incorrect $1 off per person for lunch, and our waitress, Latanya, gave us the $1.50 off dinner coupon.  She was great even though they were still fairly busy around 1:30.  Very friendly and always smiling, she kept our drinks filled and took care of several other tables.  

Next time I'll take pictures.  This isn't your average buffet.  Everything tasted very fresh and there was so much variety.  I look forward to a return visit and would definitely take friends or family who are visiting if I didn't feel like cooking at home and trashing the kitchen."}
{"text":"The best Chinese buffet I have found in town.  That being said, chinese buffets are not very healthy or high in quality in general.  
When your looking for a self indulgent $10 chinese lunch; this is the place!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Asian buffets in the east valley. They offer a good selection of foods from sushi to stir-fry as well your typical Asian American offerings (sweet & sour chicken, crab wontons, black pepper chicken etc. ) As far as a high quality buffet I wouldn't go that far, they are about in the middle the road in my opinion. I think its definitely worth going to if you like a good variety of Asian foods as well as sushi. I do like that they are constantly replenishing the foods and they don't typically run out of items."}
{"text":"I got really bad diarrhea from this place. 
I should've read the reviews.
I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to begin with this.  We showed up right at the start of dinner and food from lunch was still out and they were slowly putting out dinner food. The sushi?  Yuck. It tasted like what you get from the grocery store deli. We saw peel and eat shrimp...yay!  Gross. How can you mess that up?!  The lo mein was really good but I didn't find much up there where I can actually say \"Wow!  This is really good!\"  Another thing... I have a lot of food allergies and they didn't have a lot of their items labeled. With all this being said, I would say that for the price it's worth it just for the crab alone."}
{"text":"This was a very good seafood buffet , from sushi to crab legs, and they constantly kept refilling the hot tray of crab.
Thoroughly enjoyed dining there, no complaints"}
{"text":"I go here with my fiance at least once a week to satisfy my seafood crave :) I don't eat much anything besides crab legs and crawfish :) Also, there are other variety such as clams and onions, snails, frog legs, sashimi, soup, and tons of other things. Services are good - bad depends on the date. However, I can tell that the servers are very attentive and quick. Good quality overall! I will become a regular customer."}
{"text":"IF 60% of the  PEOPLE EATING THERE ARE ASIANS THEN TRUST its good(not trying to be mean but its true) Sunday Buffet $18. But worth it. Theres sashimi, oysters, crab legs, fried blue crab and more to their additional and regular items. We went on a mission to eat seafood. I started with tons of sashimi and other rolls. Got a plate of clams, fried blue crab and some teriyaki short ribs. After that moved to crab legs more blue crab, crawfish and more clams. I got some other items like their eggplant and some chcicken on a stick. Everything was good not the usual nasty frozen seafood you get at other places. we come here for their freahness and cleanliness. I dont think ive see such a clean buffet besides a buffet in vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice. The 1st time, it was a nice experience, not too busy, we were greeted right away, server was attentive. The food here is a better quality buffet and they have an huge variety of different foods that normally aren't seen in other Chinese buffets.  (You have to be willing to try some really different things). 

The 2nd time we came here, it was AWFUL from the start. It was busy but I wouldn't say slammed. We came in and I saw two gals by the cash register. I said hello and we waited, waited, waited for them to even LOOK UP at us. After a few MINUTES of us STARING at them they finally looked at us and then continued to ignore us. I was shocked at how they were blatantly ignoring us. Finally a 3rd girl came over and FINALLY seated us. We ended up with two very confused servers who couldn't figure out whose table it was. 

Like the time before, the food was very good, same exotic variety. When we were finished with our meal, our server took our credit card and we waited, waited, waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting for my credit card to come back to me, I got nervous and went up the cash register. As I walked up, there was my credit card-on the counter, face up, with all the numbers very clearly visible & displayed to whoever walked by it along with several other people's cards that were spread out on the counter-right next to the pathway to the door. There were 3 servers at the register, all of whom were at least 8 feet away from the cards with their backs to it while they chatted. Who knows how long any of those cards had been there. I was so furious when I saw this. I demanded to know why my credit card was sitting on the counter in the open, face up with no one even WATCHING to make sure it wasn't stolen. They had no explanation and simply spit out some lame \"I'm sorry\" to me. 

I don't care how awesome the food is, bad service is bad service. One should be able to hand a credit card to the server to pay for their meal w/o worrying about the numbers or even the card itself being stolen. I choose to take my dollars as far away as possible from this place."}
{"text":"Best buffet I have been to in a long time. Crab legs were meaty and everything tastes great!"}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome but the vermicelli and other thin white noodles were kind of bland when we went. We usually have no complaints every time we go to Pacific but their noodles could've used a bit of salt.

The crab legs were gone as fast as they appeared too, they didn't refill them for about 20 mins."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and it's the cleanest Chinese buffet in the area. Food is of high quality especially the seafood. The only buffet sushi I feel safe eating. Lunch is reasonably priced and even though dinner is a little pricey it's worth it.

One time I found a hair in the ice cream so that was a bummer."}
{"text":"This place used to be good 5 years ago and now it's gone down hill. 
Went there on a week night for dinner and it was pretty slow. A lot of the meat items almost broke my tooth because it's so hard and old. There was a old guy there obviously related to the ownership because he went in and out of the kitchen and he hawked a nasty loggie into the bus tray right in front of our dining table while we were eating. Are you kidding me ? Why he go spit into a napkin or in the restroom. If he doesn't that in front of us in the dining area, imagine what he will do in the kitchen!!!
We paid $43 for two for the nasty disgusting food."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is always fresh even when we get there right before closing. Last week we made it 45 mins before closing and the sushi bar hardly had anything, which is understandable being so late, but the sushi chef made us fresh sushi and sliced up fresh salmon and tuna. I love how they cater to the customers. Never had bad food or service."}
{"text":"Been eating on insurance money around the marriot hotel. For the money this is so far the best. A lot of asian customers and staff. Food was all good. Sushi was very good for a buffet place. Most cooked for has a touch of spice. Literally way to much to eat so I tried a vareity. Mussels are all good in many forms. Pork ribs and squd octopus and plenty of dessert choices. Dont eat there too often hard to stick to a diet. Very good."}
{"text":"An unexpected and great find on my travels through Chandler. Great buffet, clean, and great seafood. Cant beat the price either! Definitely a great place to stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Worth the wait... But the place gets hectic. Be prepared to wait on yourself, the plus side is... They have it all when it comes to seafood. Surprisingly its cooked perfect, yet served in a filthy buffet."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5/5

This place is very similar to other Asian buffet restaurants that I have been to, but the sheer selection of food bumps it up a bit. They have crab legs, but if you're there on a crowded night you must be willing to wait awhile or fend off the vultures waiting and cutting in line to take plates of it back to their tables. If not, you won't get any.

Service: 3.5/5

The service was about on par with other Asian buffets that I've been to. I can never seem to find a single smile on any of the people that work here. Although the friendliness factor is severely lacking, the dirty plates are usually taken away promptly and your drinks are refilled in a timely manner. The workers are never rude, I just wish I could see a smile or grin...heck, I'll even take a smirk.

Cleanliness: 4/5

I have never had a problem with cleanliness here. The tables are always clean and I never have to rummage through the plates to find one that doesn't have leftover food or debris that survived the dishwasher on it like other buffets. The comfort of grabbing the top plate with confidence to begin chowing down ASAP is very important in my buffet experience!

Food: 3.5/5

ALL YOU CAN EAT ICE CREAM!!!! You're not gonna be blown out of the water by anything in particular, but the selection is where they get a higher grade. From your standard buffet dishes (fried rice, spicy tofu, etc..) to the dim sum dishes (chicken feet, shumai, etc..) to the Mongolian style BBQ to the sushi bar (hand rolls, sashimi, etc..)...this place has something for everyone. They even have things like frog legs and snails too.

Cons:

On a crowded night it'll take some effort to get crab legs.
Stay away from the beef for the Mongolian BBQ...its extremely tough.
Very stingy with the salmon sashimi"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing quality for seafood lovers like my wife and CHINESE for myself. Service is usually great unless they are short on servers one time out of 4. Has to be the best CHINESE buffet in Arizona at $18 seniors price. So far we have only gone for dinner and taken our guests from ny and fla here. Everyone loves it.Live year round in MARICOPA. Thankful to find a place this good. No wait for very large crab legs anywhere. Tray constantly filled. Tip take from the filled trays first. By second plate the half empty will be fill. Best run CHINESE seafood buffet in New York be jersey and Arizona.worth every penny. According to my wife who eats fish non stop, the spice is amazing.I've never seen her eat so much food anywhere. Will bring all our guests here besides going here once or twice a moth driving from MARICOPA 35 minutes. Wow wow and double wow. No need to look for any other buffet. Place is clean and no bugs anywhere in the 4 nights we've been there. Food was hot sodas and tea were fine. Unlike other buffets each dish has its own taste. Enjoy yourself. Have no clue how any one has negatives about anything. Very strange?"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of seafood items. No one item to rave about but across the board acceptable quality.  Mongolian BBQ station had only two meat items but nice selection of veggies for your enjoyment. Large dessert area including ice cream you scoop out yourself. Sushi tasty with ginger and various Asian salads and dishes the Asian pallet would enjoy."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a while so I thought I would give it another try with my daughter last night.  It was OK -- price is now $18.88 pp without drinks.  Add another $2+ if you want drink too.  I can understand prices going up, especially with the minimum wage increase, but I don't think purposely making the food less tasty is a good strategy -- believe me, I really think they use this as a cost and consumption control strategy.  Let me give you some examples -- the fried crab is not seasoned well.  All they gotta do here is add more seasoning before dumping the crab in the deep fryer.  The pigs' feet is bland in taste; primarily needing more black vinegar and ginger.  The steamed fish filets need more seasoning -- more soy sauce, more ginger slivers, more green onion slivers, and more hot oil.  Oh yeah, we made the mistake of going to dinner early, so I think we got the tail end of the lunch stuff that was left out on the steam table.  The kalbi was hard and dry as a rock; the steamed fish filets were like pieces of leather from the soles of old shoes; and the veggies were all wilted and overcooked.  However, even though the sashimi (ahi, sea bass, and saba) were Grade \"B\" quality, there was enough put out this time for me to enjoy my fill.  IMHO, if another place opened up with better quality food but charged a higher price (like maybe $25 pp), this place might just go under."}
{"text":"Best food!!!! I love coming here with my husband it's what we call 'Our Spot we just love the service their always kind and friendly the food is always fresh and hot. 
The only thing I could say is I don't particularly like the restrooms their not always the cleanest and smell weird."}
{"text":"A big \"thank you\" to Rand H. for being so diligent about reviewing buffets in the area.  I was anxious to try this restaurant, so I stopped in for lunch the other day.  It has an extremely nice atmosphere, more upscale than your average chinese buffet and seemed very clean.  The food selection is certainly impressive and I wasn't sure where to begin.

I started off with several salads including cucumber/tomato/onion, seaweed, calamari, edamame and peel and eat shrimp.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious.  My next go round included miso soup (perfect), fried calmari, several different types of sushi (excellent), szechwan eggplant, stir fried chinese veggies and spicy tofu with mushrooms and peas.  Again, everything was very good.  I wanted to keep eating, but I was determined to exercise discipline.  I was really too full, even for dessert where I observed a variety of ice creams (scoop your own from the cartons).  

Overall, it was a great dining experience and the service was top notch.  With tax and tip it was $11.00 for lunch.  I hate to sound cheap (which I am) but this felt like a couple dollars more than it should have been.  I, personally did not need so many selections since I tend to avoid the regular greasy chinese entrees (orange/sesame chicken, sweet & sour pork etc.).  I would, however, like to try it for dinner in order to sample some more seafood selections"}
{"text":"Like Todai but better!  Chinese owned buffet with Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American fare."}
{"text":"Everyone writing Great reviews on here are such Great liars. Thank you for fooling me and for making me waste almost $20 on cold food that wasn't even worth it. 

I came here because I enjoy trying out new spots and I like to yelp them before I go. And because this place had awesome reviews I was really excited to try it. 

Everything in this buffet was cold. Funny thing is, the food warmers were steaming like crazy so I would've thought they were at least hot. But no, it was cold. Big down fall. I didn't like the food at all. It was all cold by the time I got to sit down with my plate. The only decent thing to eat here was the sushi and the asparagus. Everything else sucked! Never am I going back they're again. Y'all need to  stop lying to everyone on here cuz if I could give them no stars, I would! 

Last advice:  you're better off at eating at Pandas Express."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. Non-existent might be a better definition. The food was ok. They have a wide selection and everything was really hot and fresh. Some dishes were much better than others... but that's to be expected at a buffet like this. The fresh-grilled hibachi option is a nice touch. I probably would have given 4 stars if their prices were lower... but for $20 a person, it's only worth 3 stars."}
{"text":"Menu wise this is a typical Chinese buffet.  I don't think I would not eat here again because the place sort of smelled and seemed dirty.  The bathroom was really dirty.  The workers look tired and unenthusiastic.  I don't trust their cleanliness and dedication in preparing the food safely.  The station trays and sushi being put out seems really small for a buffet as well which also makes me think they are cutting cost wherever they can."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Pacific.  Went there yesterday Sun. Dec. 12 at lunch with some Canadian friends.  A previous review made me believe that we should get there earlier because of wait times.  Despite all efforts we arrived just after 12:00 and were ushered right in.  No wait times. So don't plan on waiting too much.  Of course the previous review had 50 people and we were only four.
Staff was very efficient and friendly.
The restaurant itself is new and nice and clean.  Colorful.  A brochue I picked up on the way out says there are 12 buffet tables.  While I didn't count them, I think that is a reasonable number and no two dishes were the same.  There were even escargo(snails) and frog legs.  Mongolian Bar B Q, sushi bar dim sum, All was there.  It's impossible to try to eat one of everything so don't even try.  Just be assured that all was very good.
Prices, for seafood, was quite reasonable:Sat, Sun. and Holidays was $14.88 with seniors of 60 enjoying a 10 discount
There is a lunch buffet (no crab legs) for $8.38-Mon-Thursday
Frday after 4 until 10 is $14.88.
This place is quite a find.  The previous reviewer couldn't have b een more accurate when he said \"...worth the price.\"  Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"This food is great for a buffet. Don't roll in here expecting \"French Laundry\". 

Dinner in weekends it gets pretty expensive as that's when they roll out there \"Premium menu\" which translates to boiled, often limp, crab legs. 

Not that you'll get any of these, because thats when the Walking Dead Horde comes in to gorge. 

I once saw a guy wait for them to refresh the oyster trey and then load up all 11 oysters on to his own plate with the line of people behind him. 

I think the only reason they didn't maul him was because they didn't think of it first.l"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this super buffet. Rand H, Mike C. and I went down to enjoy a meal. As usual by the wisdom of Rand H. we arrived at about 11AM ready to eat. The first thing you see to your left as the hostess showed us to our table was an IMPRESSIVE SUSHI BAR! I went straight for the sushi and everything I put on my plate was great. I then started at the rest. It was nice and clean and the help was friendly.

The only reason It did not get five stars was because it rests in the shadows of the amazing buffets that I have recently enjoyed with my usual crew. Try it for yourself and tell us what you think!"}
{"text":"If you like Chinese/Asian buffets, then Pacific is king. I used to love Chinese buffets. For around $5-$7, you can eat all you want of fried rice, sweet and sour pork, crab puffs, barbecue pork...french fries, and pizza. Hah. It always amused me you that you can get french fries along side fried rice.

I don't like Chinese buffets quite as much anymore, as I prefer a freshly prepared dish not steam table scrappings, but Pacific has much improved on the Chinese buffets of yore. Sushi bar (made by some what authentic sushi chefs, atleast you can see them make it in person and the chefs look like they come somewhere from Asai if not Japan), Mongolian bbq, dim sum, and seafood. However, anyone trying to get the dinner foods for lunch prices by waiting until dinner starts will be notified in person by a helpful server that an additional charge will be added if they see anything remotely that looks like a sea cockroach on your plate. Ugh. Thanks for making my meal experience awkward. 

Despite that, the selection is great, food is reasonably fresh and hot, and the service is generally good for asian buffets. When I'm in the mood for lots of random asian grub without a wait, I know where to go."}
{"text":"Worst experience we ever had as a family eating together..small and too expensive for the food they serve...food were not good, service not good, overall, not good at all. The tables were too close together and not comfortable to get up and get food...if one person gets up to go get food, that whole rows have to get up..."}
{"text":"This buffet is very tasty!  Nice staff and good food!  Also, the desserts here are very good!  The prices are very fair.  I would definitely go there if you want to be in a place with a good atmosphere and a great variety of food!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for what you're paying. Crabs legs we're the best this time but the previous time they we're good. Dessert section is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"Ate there Yesterday
Food  was  average 
Sushi was Ok.    
Waited a long time for crab leg.  Over an hour 
They were tiny for a 16 dollars buffet

Good variety but  all tasted mediocre 
Lots of dirty plates.  
Told the girl at the fruit bar, and she came out with a towel to clean it  right at the buffet table.  Donno why she did not take it back to the washing machine .   I took a pic too
Great wall taste better and shan hai too"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of buffets unless I'm in Vegas but I was in the mood for seafood one night so we came here and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity.  There are plenty of different dishes to choose from. The crab legs go fast but they do replenish quickly. Stay away from the carby rice and noodle dishes and fill up on squid, mussels, shrimp and crab!! The only thing I question is the cleanliness of the place. I saw a server put one of those bussing bins on top of the table and when I left I saw a male employee take those same bins and dump the contents in a dumpster and I saw the bin touch the trash ick hoping they wash and disinfect those things."}
{"text":"The exterior looks pretty decent , however , once inside you arent really greeted. There is no direction. My family and i sat down, the waitress was awesome. But once we got up to get food, it was a rush every time. The food items which were most popular had the biggest rush , and the people swarming around was never ending. This buffet was definitely quantity over quality for sure. I hate buffets anyways but i thought i would give them a chance. The issue i had most was the waitress asked me if i wanted a refill, she was great but then she turned around asked every other table. So by the time she came back around , i dont think she realized which water was whose and just placed them randomly at each table and walked away. I felt sick to my stomach and paid for my meal and left. I wouldnt go back again. I would rather pay $200 and have the best meal , then $50.00 and be disgusted."}
{"text":"Whatever you want they have it.  All of the asian food that you can think of.  Fresh sushi, and mongolian bbq too if you are in the mood.  On the weekends they also have crab legs.  This place is well worth the price and wait (if there is one)."}
{"text":"The BEST buffet in Phoenix. I love the crab legs (you have to time it just right since they only bring them out every 15 minutes or so), sushi and BBQ pork. For the price it simply cannot be beat.

We visit at least once a month for dinner and it is always clean and busy. Busy is good for a buffet since they refresh the dishes often.

I have never gotten sick, nor seen any bugs at this location.

Is it as good as a 5 star sushi place? No. But it is the best inexpensive sushi I have ever had.

For those complaining about service, children or other 'annoyances' it is a BUFFET. Buffets are generally family friendly. If you want to have a quiet dinner pick a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet. It has a very large variety of food, I couldn't eat everything I wanted to because there was just too much to try. My favorite aspect was all the barbecue dishes (and the tasty fried plantains). Lunch buffet is $10 before tax or tip, which is a great price for so much good food, plus the Mongolian grill and sushi bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give buffets another chance and we chose Pacific Seafood Buffet.  This place is insane!  I think it's the best buffet I've ever been to.  We've gone twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch.  I think dinner is around $16 and lunch is around $9.  They only change a few menu items between lunch and dinner.  With dinner they offer frog legs, crab legs, crawfish, and sashimi.  If you're like me and aren't really interested in these items you're much better off going for lunch.  The only item I really love off the dinner buffet is the seared tuna, it's divine, and besides that I'm not a huge fan of eating shellfish at buffets.

Their selection is wonderful.  They have all the classic Chinese dishes you'd expect at buffet but then so much more.  The sushi is amazing.  It's not what you'd expect to get a buffet.  They also have tempura which I absolutely love.  The barbeque area is very unique, I'd never seen that a buffet before.  They offer a bunch of different kinds of grilled meat and fish and grilled veggies like asparagus and corn.  The dim sum area is very nice and everything I've tried there has been delicious!  If you're a vegetarian you're not stuck with one or two dishes either, they have a decent meat free selection.  They also have a Mongolian barbeque set up.  I've never tried it but all the meat and veggies look fresh.   They also have a few dishes for more adventurous eaters; they have 2 chicken feet dishes and one with tripe.  

The best part is their soup area.  I've never found a Chinese buffet that actually has good soup before but the soups at Pacific Seafood are all awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy I got seafood in my tummy &  I'm not going to regurgitate it for you. Lol . It was good . Endless crab legs not snow or blue but still good . The stuffed scallops are great along with the stuffed crab. Hot & sour soup good compared to most. Coffee mouse was good.  Its hard to understand the waitresses. Ya know an Asian place is good when Asians are eating at it and you're a minority."}
{"text":"Today my hubby and I went to a chinese seafood buffet place because I was craving all you can eat crab legs. I was expecting lots of seafood but their selection was kind of meh. I DID find chicken feet, pigs feet, frog legs, and whole baby octopi however. So I decided (bravely) to try them. 

First of all, I have no idea how you are supposed to eat chicken feet. It is, well, it's a freaking chicken foot. It's all bones with a little bit of skin on it. Just the way it looked was enough to make me gag. But I figured, I would probably not have this opportunity again. So I picked it up and was like, am I supposed to just bite into it? I decided not to and instead tried picking the \"meat\" off the bone. It was so tough - like rubber. I managed to get this eraser sized piece off and put it in my mouth. Blech! It was seasoned in some kind of chili sauce and was so tough, I couldn't even chew it. So I immediately spit it out. 

Then I moved onto the pigs foot. It looked like a little short rib and thankfully it didn't have the hoof still attached. But it was pure fat. I looked for any hint of meat, but there was none. So I bit into it (because you can). Blech! It's freaking like blubbery jelly. I almost lost it right then and there. The taste was like pork, but the texture grossed me out. 

I needed a minute to recover from that. But then I moved onto the frog leg. I picked a piece of meat off the bone. It's true what they say, that it tastes like chicken. The texture is like chicken too. It was almost like eating a chicken wing due to the size. It wasn't bad. But after I ate that little piece, I saw a long blue vein running through the rest of it. Then I saw more blue things inside. Just the visual was enough to put it down. Too bad because it tasted okay. 

I actually like octopus, but I've never had a whole one before. I was a little scared, but I started with the legs. It was good! So I quickly shoved the rest in my mouth and it was fine. Nothing squirted out, which I was afraid of. It was just chewy all around and tasted okay. 

So did I ever get to try any crab? Well, when they finally brought it out I grabbed a few pieces and thought finally! But when I opened the claw, there was NO meat! WTF? What the hell kind of crab is this (it wasn't snow crab)? So I cracked open a leg. Again, very little meat and what was there, was dry and tasted extremely fishy. I got scared and didn't eat anymore. 

So there was my adventure into the scary world of chinese seafood buffets. At least I got to cleanse my pallet with dry chocolate cake and some really good kahlua and cream like jello shot. THAT was the best thing I had all day!"}
{"text":"this has been edited for the visually challenged.

haha yeah, todai in the biltmore was a bust.  they began the downhill slide when they gave out birthday \"vouchers\"......good for the NEXT visit.  little did they realize is that most people who came in to eat free on their birthdays usually brought in a boat load of friends, relatives and other full paying customers that would not have probably come in at all (lemme see, 1 free loader, and 10 full paying customers x $25 ea?) duh, lemme get a calculator (for you post ti-55 borners) too bad they fell asleep in that boring marketing 101 class eh?

back to PSFB, not a bad place to go on a weekday and get all you can eat sushi for about $10.  yeah, it ain't RA, sakana or beni but it will suffice.  

we like the fact that you can have a party of like 20 family and friends and there's no haggling over what to order, glaring at the late comers, or having to eat someone elses \"favorite\" dish.  (i hope my family doesn't read this).  

back in the day, we used to have to drive 400 mi to todai in LA, then 15 mi to the biltmore, and now all we have to do is walk a mile to NW corner of elliot and AZ av. to what used to be the long time iconic eatery, bill johnsons.  

i miss the sawdust floors but i soon forget as i'm eating my 24th piece of sushi, 8th rack of korean short ribs and 4th bowl of green tea ice cream.  and as i recall the only thing i learned in econ 101, there is the much welcomed east valley competition just 2 miles west and 1 mile south (hint: it's on the NE corner sharing a parking lot with MCD's, lee lee, and caddy-corner to that dimslum place)

ok kinda sewer"}
{"text":"5 words... Do NOT eat here. YUCK......................ok a few more words disgusting, gross, and nasty.."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  I suppose its not entirely their fault.  They would have to charge much higher prices to get really good seafood in there. 

The fried shrimp was good but I didn't care for anything else.  Everybody else in the restaurant though seemed to love it."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here. It is the first and only time the app has let me down. 

Walking up to the door, the restaurant looks like it took the place of a Red Lobster. The decor is non-descript for the most part. Then you enter and are tossed into a bright, bustling lunch wagon! Goodness gracious. It was a bit overwhelming at first, partially because the entrance is right at the foot of the first buffet line.

I was greeted immediately and seated just as fast. Before I could sit, the greeter asked what I wanted. Water. Then, with a smile, she was gone. \"OK, this place is homestyle,\" I thought. No frilly lace, no fancy adornments. Just mounds of quick food and easy service. Deal! I was there on business and wanted a quick, easy lunch anyway.

First thing was to check out the restroom and wash my hands. Eck. The restroom was pretty terrible. It always concerns me when an establishment has a smelly restroom, even mildly smelly, as this one was. 

The rest of the establishment was clean, and there were servers all over the place - wiping surfaces, filling food, checking on restaurant goers. I was very pleased with the service. It's the kind of place where you don't notice your server filling your water or leaving your bill, which could be a bad thing, depending. 

*Note to patrons: If you have a cold, maybe consider not coming to a buffet. Or, if you feel compelled to, or are dragged to the establishment unwillingly, at least cover your mouth as you hack. Where are your manners? That's not cute, or sanitary. 

Sitting down, I found that the booths are quite uncomfortable. If you are above 5'-8\", as I am, be ready to use those contortionist skills you never trained for. The booth is situated in such a way that you are forced to have both elbows nearly on - or on, if that's your style - the table. It was the strangest thing. I kept looking at other tables, wondering if other folks were having a comparable experience. But, alas, most people didn't look to be over 5'-8. 

Then I scanned the buffet. The restaurant has a very broad offering, but, goodness, it would have been nice to have some place cards to let us know what we were eating. Only a few items were named.  The offerings included an assortment of dim sum, Chinese stir fry vegetable and meat dishes, short ribs, what looked to be marinated and steamed pork, fried rice, crab legs, noodles and a dessert bar, which included the likes of Jell-O and ice cream. But, in all, the food wasn't all that great. My absolute favorite dish with the sautéed spinach. Wow. I could have had that all alone. It was lightly seasoned with a hint of ginger. Very fresh and soft. Just beautiful and bright. 

Then there was everything else. 

Sadly, the sushi was beyond its time. I went for the white fish, salmon and what appeared to be red snapper. The salmon was of the softer feel, which was slightly strange because the rice was a bit too firm. The white fish was OK, but the red snapper lookalike was a bit too firm. I also tried a couple of rolls. They reminded me of the prepackaged rolls you can get from the grocery store. Awww, bummer."}
{"text":"Okay now, im not a huge Buffet fan, but this place is bloody brilliant, they have delicious amazing crab legs and a huge!! selection of different ethnic foods, such as \"frog legs\" \"sticky rice in pineapple\" amzing fresh sushi bar were the chef is right in the middle cutting and slicing up the fish.  The service was okay, but the food definitely makes up for it.  because of the high valume of guests going in and out of that place, the food is always fresh and replaced right away.

Its a big up from me and definitely go back there anytime."}
{"text":"Fist time here - it's a buffet so keep that in mind.  Food was OK if you can get past the filthy bathrooms and food on the floor near the buffet area.  The utensils were being shared between dishes (one soup ladel for 3 different soups).  The napkins that are used to wrap the utensils were like tissues so thankfully they give  you more when you sit down.   Good variety of food but could be cleaner which made me worry of getting food poisening.  One great deal is the crab legs  - it made it worth the cost.  Expect large families with screaming kids and a crowd that is less than 2 stars when it comes to eating and manners."}
{"text":"Family of 4 arrived around 6pm on a weekday. 

A 12 year old, 16 year old and two adults.

Not a lot of variety for someone who doesn't stray off the normal menu. 
From what I did try, it was very good and flavorful. 

Our waitress kept up on our drinks and cleaning of the tables. 

Price for a family of 4 was around $88.00. For this price, none of the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I had terrible service, the employees were very rude, food was not fresh and there was a hair in my cake. Me and my family got there ten minutes before dinner (which we were unaware of) and the waitress took the plate of crab legs OUT OF MY HAND! and said we weren't allowed to eat dinner foods. I wouldn't have minded paying the difference but this place was awful. Never again."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks."}
{"text":"My favorite clean open buffet ever 
Me and family enjoy the yummy sea food, sushi etc like their customer service. Very recommended"}
{"text":"The first time we went (about 3 weeks ago) was impressive. They have crab legs, sushi, Mongolian BBQ, and dim sum. They even had mackerel sashimi!  We have been wanting to go back and so tonight we did but we were so grossed out. I couldn't believe the difference!  We were sat in a rundown dining room with stained carpets and janky blinds.  I'm not sure if it was my imagination but the selection was less (on a Saturday) and the quality was horrible. I usually look on the bright side when it comes to food but this was just awful. Lukewarm. Bland. Flavorless actually. And just plain bad. I actually spit out several mouthfuls rather than swallow them and move on, which I would normally. The beef and broccoli was terrible. Weird texture and zero flavor.  Even the brownie I grabbed for dessert redemption was terrible and I did not eat it. We agreed that the best things were the jello, ice tea and Pepsi."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good this place was, in all honesty. My friend and I dropped in for lunch today, and we were definitely not expecting it to be of this quality for only about ten dollars each person! That being said, despite how it calls itself a seafood buffet, most of their food isn't necessarily seafood, and their sushi selection was decent but very limited. Also, as a side note, all of their stuffed items (mussels, clams, crabs, mushrooms, etc) were filled with a stuffing that in my opinion had way too much onion. However, overall I enjoyed the food, and definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they finally open this 2nd location in AZ.

I'm a fan of seafood buffet. I love walking into a restaurant and have access to your food right away and taking your time eating, that is until they bring out the fortune cookies.

I only look for the following at a buffet --  crab legs, crawfishes, sushis, frog legs, and stir-fry mushrooms/green beans. and this place HAS IT ALL!! They also have a nice grill area for those who like to have their vege and meat grilled.

Gotta try their Green Tea Ice Cream too!! It's great for dessert afterward"}
{"text":"Way overpriced Chinese buffet! Sorry I don't want chicken feet! Will not return. Staff was nice but $40+ for dinner with iced tea? Nah..."}
{"text":"You're seated by a friendly hostess who explains the enormous selections and various stations, promptly greeted by a waiter who takes your drink order and send you off to buffet heaven.

Even though we arrived an hour and 1/2 before closing, everything was fresh and if anything was missing, they would cook it to order. We couldn't believe the offerings set before us! 4 full buffet stations, a sushi station, a stir-fry station, a BBQ station, a dessert station, & an ice cream station. Every 15 minutes, fresh king crab legs appeared! Oh, we all tried so many different things we have never seen before and loved every one. The waitstaff is highly attentive and courteous and tended to our every need. Our drinks never reached empty.
Definitely try this place if you get a chance! Saturday lunch is a special price - almost half-price!"}
{"text":"Looked good from far, but far from good!  Dined there jan.3 for dinner&  it was our first time.  We walked in and stood at the hostess station for about 4 minutes with no acknowledgment.  Finally I asked the girl if we needed to put our names in for seating.  After not getting seated for about 10 minutes (out of order), we started browsing the buffet.  There is quite a variety of different dishes that you wouldn't see at a normal chinese buffet.  By the time you had to narrow your choices from either dry, or burnt, rubbery entrees, we settled on the safer choices.  The waiter didn't show up to take our drink order for about 5 minutes.  We didn't actually get our hot tea until we were finished with our first plates.  The tea wasn't even jasmine tea!  It was a lipton tea bag!    He never checked on us or even picked up one single plate throughout our entire meal.  I asked him how long they had been open, he said since october.  Now tell me how a restaurant that is only 3 months old can have the worst hostesses, wait staff, & cooks imaginable.  I had mentioned to the waitor how unacceptable everything was...  he apologized and then took another 30 minutes to give us the bill.  The price for an adult was 15.99 and my 4 yr. Old was charged $3.88. Plus the two bucks for the bitter lipton tea.  There was no attempt to get a manager to rectify the situation.  Clearly, nobody cares what you think.  I was so infuriated that a lack of management presence allows these\" teenagers\" and their lackidaisical attitudes run this place.  So i'm yelping!   Mediocre food, high prices, and crappy service.  Will never go back again, unless they pull their act together and start getting better reviews."}
{"text":"I called for the price and was told 8.95. A bit skeptical due to the low price.  I mean, seriously? Ok, so I went on yelp to read the reviews.  I read through the review and felt pretty comfortable.  Although, there was one which talked about a roach and showed a picture.  At first, obviously a bit unsettling, but lets face it, where is there a place that has food which does not attract roaches?  The question was, is the place disgusting inside or unsanitary?  I thought I'd go see for myself.

Place was clean.  Temp was good.  I only ad the sushi and it was moving off the table pretty fast as there was ample amount of people getting sushi.  I think the place is busy enough that their food doesn't stick around that long to spoil or incur issue.  There was a person that mentioned going there at a certain time could affect this temperature issue, I think he mentioned later on.  Not sure.  But during lunch when I went, everything looked and tasted good.  My body feel fine.  Service was good and friendly.  A very wide selection of stuff to choose from."}
{"text":"NEVER been disappointed, quality is good, food is good, great variety and the ambiance is also good. Some of my favorites are Fresh made Sushi, Fresh Oysters, love their soups, Fresh Crab meat, and Great Scallop shells, .....on the down side corn and beef ribs are always over cooked or dried out everything else is good. Deserts are plenty if you still have room. Traditional Chinese dishes are many to choose from, be sure to go there hungry so you can try everything."}
{"text":"Wonderful and fresh good. Great selection of Soups, New Zealand Green lip mussels with cheese are stellar!! Marinated pork chops are a highlight. Best lunch Value for Senior Citizens. Seaweed salad is always great and the Sushi is very good for a buffet. Get the Asian waitresses because they happy and like their job; the co-owner is usually there giving personal attention to the operation. Just a nice discovery in culinary expression."}
{"text":"This is another great AYCE sushi buffet with excellent food at an incredible price. It's such an amazing variety 
of culinary eats that it's worth the visit time and time again.  From traditional hot Asian foods to sushi, it's 
delectable at every turn. In fact, it's so much variety that you'll be there for hours sampling one dish to another. 
I love their dim-sum and desserts such as the Chinese goodluck red bean buns, the sesame balls, and the
almond sesame cookies. 

Oh, and lastly as an honorable mention, the sushi hand rolls are to die for. You have to order at the sushi bar
such as the spicy tuna roll, the avocado crab roll, the yellowtail tuna roll with chopped green onions to enhance
the buttery taste of hamachi (yellowtail) etc..... you can order any custom hand roll in any combination to your
hearts content.  I will miss this place !!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time for their unlimited sushi buffet and crab legs! This is my favorite place in the valley for buffet as they always keep great taste of the food. It never changed since 4 years ago when I first ate at this place. Loving the management!"}
{"text":"King Crab Shrimp, Halibut, Cod those are expensive to buy at the grocery store. This place has it all for one price like a high priced spread at the Vegas Casinos only for a much lower price. Go in with a good appetite and your stomach will appreciate you. Stick with the Seafood it is the speciality."}
{"text":"Food just OK, raw Oyster always empty, poor service."}
{"text":"Nice buffet with plenty of choices to include a chef to prepare your raw noodles.  They also include a fresh sushi bar.  The place is usually packed for dinner.  I paid about $45.00 for two adults and one child.  Their seafood selection is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best buffet in town. Being born and raised in Hawaii and living in Japan and Korea My expectations where high. They were met I go at least 3xs a week"}
{"text":"The five stars is because I loved the sushi buffet they have inside! (I'm sad I didn't get a picture) They have actual rolls served out and you could pick two pieces from each roll and try them all! Each of the rolls were rolled freshly and I liked everything I tried!
The regular part buffet wasn't anything special though. Service was up with our drinks. Place was clean and we were happy."}
{"text":"I am definately a fan. I have gone for both lunch and dinner .....
the sushi bar alone makes it worth the trip. The place is clean and everyone is helpful and friendly.  Besides the sushi bar they have an abundant amount of selections including a vraiety of ethnic Chinese dishes in the buffet area. There is a salad bar and lots of desserts.....
A MUST TRY! Bring your appetite cause you will EAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Its okay, I went there on a Thursday at 1pm for lunch. I paid like 10 dollar plus tax.

I don't really recommend it. I thought it was a disappointment. The sushi does not look fresh but it taste okay.

They have alot of different asian food and seafood. But quality is in question.

If you like buffet go for it. If not...dont do it...."}
{"text":"Did not like it what so ever. I had to go because of my friends. I'm allergic to shell fish by the way. All there non seafood food sucked. I use to enjoy comming here for their kbbq. But the last time I went here, there kbbq were hard as rocks. The sushi wasn't great either. However, my friends love their seafood. Crab goes by quick so wait in line."}
{"text":"This place has been here as long as I can remember. The entrance and interior leaves a lot to be desired. The buffet was interesting! A large variety of food including chicken feet! Sadly the blue crabs were covered in Old Bay seasoning making them inedible. The snow crabs as most places were frozen and tasted like freezer burn. The sushi options were good and they even offered pork spare ribs in the cantonese style! Kudos! The value is better during the week and you can easily gain a ton of weight going too often. A different dining experience looking at the variety of food they offer. I wasn't able to try a ton of stuff but definitely worth going"}
{"text":"I used be a fan for this place. and frequently be there last two years. However, couple months ago, I went there with my friends (two Asians and one Caucasian). We three were all fine. I don't know what happened to my Caucasian friend. That night he started to vomit and diarrhea, and he is the big fan for this place. After that night, we were not be this place frequently. I think they may just make some one time mistake, but we just could not remember this place when we want to have buffet."}
{"text":"Best buffet I have ever been to. 
Great selection, and large selection of Sushi too. 

Yum Yum"}
{"text":"This used to be an okay restaurant. We dined today party of two with drinks came out $42. We have to wait longer to be seated because there was no one at the reception. Food was obviously leftover from lunch - hard, dried, old. Never did get a refill for our drinks from star to finish. Did not dish out until the very end! What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Will not be returning. We decided to take a crazy chance on this place and it was worse than I thought it would be. Children running around and when they bring out crab legs you would have thought they were bringing out stacks of $100 bills. Food was terrible and the service wasn't much better. Do not waste your time or money"}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good because most buffets were dirty and lacked variety but over the years, this place is starting to decline and honestly they should start renovating the place. It's dirty and old. I've seen roaches crawling the seats."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for the first time last night.  It's a bit expensive ($40 for two) but has a good variety and everything tastes good.  The frog legs were excellent and they have really good soups.  Table drink service was excellent.  It's worth the trip if you don't mind the cost."}
{"text":"Totally Awesome Buffet!!   I love crablegs and sushi and have not found a better place to get it all at.   $13.88 is a great deal for unlimited crablegs.  Lunch is a little less since there aren't any.  They have everything from Authentic Asian food to American Chinese Food.  No need to search any further for top quality food and service.  Even if you don't like Seafood they have stuff for you too!  For all you cheapos out there, go to Long John Silvers for your seafood if you can't afford to pay $14 for a totally great Seafood experience.  The only thing I didn't like was the jerk customers who gave the cashier a hard time about the price.  People who want to bitch about the price should stay home!  One recommedation for this type of people, check the price BEFORE you stuff you face with delicious food.  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes seafood or chinese food."}
{"text":"Each week a different family member gets to pick where to eat after church. My daughter's (6yo) pick this week was Pacific Seafood Buffet, she loves any buffet but this one has left an impression on her for some reason. We have been there a few times before and they always have fresh Asian buffet style food. I like the Sushi... while it is your normal American style rolls, the chef will take special requests if you ask. They also have a few unique items that rotate at different times... and allow you to experiment.

A tip... go for a early dinner or late lunch, esp if you like things like the Crab Legs (Snow), as those things tend to go fast when the place is full (always been full when I go for dinner). And a side note - I hate it when one person takes like 20 legs full plate...and leaves none for anyone else....but oh well."}
{"text":"This place is NOT okay for me...
I have gained serious pounds eating here.

I am that person that stakes out the sushi bar and crab legs like a fiend.  Yeah, I'm that girl.  The sushi is okay for a buffet, but the sashimi is awesome.  Really.  And the crab legs are always really good, if you can get there before the hoarders move in.

I avoid the fried foods and typical buffet fare just so I can fill up on the good stuff. :)  But there is definitely something for everyone here.

Go for lunch!  Dinner is expensive and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"I was undecided on where to eat as I just recently moved to Glendale from Mesa. I must say I am pleased with my decision. The food was good and fresh. The price wasn't too steep either. The decor was a bit worn but this was expected. It's a family friendly buffet so if stellar ambience is what you are seeking in addition to your meal you may want to dine elsewhere. Overall pretty good place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the past ten years.  This must be a compliment to the buffet that it has endured this long pleasing my palate!  Indeed a place that give value, fresh food, many choices  and pleasant staff.  They continue to offer many many food items, well over 100 choices, many from the sea, with an oriental flair.  Most of the time busy, all of the time friendly and of good value.  As time has gone by I have developed my own rhythm of food choices so that now I usually know what I am going to eat there.  I head to the back and fill a bowl with hot & sour soup.  I take a second bowl and FILL it with shrimp, mushrooms, pot-stickers, calamari, pieces of fish and meat, all scavenged from the many available items on the multiple steam tables.  Back at my table I add these items one by one to the soup and feast!  Next I go up front to the sushi station and load up on sashami, preferring the slices of salmon and tuna mostly.  I ask the sushi chef for a ball of sushi rice that he uses in his rolls and I fill  a little cup with pickled ginger and another with wasabi to mix at the table with soy sauce.  I skipped over the King crab legs, the snails, the clams, the mussels but did eat a little duck with its crispy skin and a small piece of baked teriyaki salmon.  Seconds on some more sashimi, ate at least a couple dozen slices, a bit of kimchi and 5 pieces of various sushi rolls, freshly made.  For desert I ate 2 chinese sugar donuts, 3 warm sesame balls and some sesame candy.  I went home satisfied and thinking of what my sushi would have cost at a sushi restaurant!  Here with my discount I spent less than $15.  I'll be back next month."}
{"text":"The motif and layout of the buffet is deceiving, as it's nicely designed for easy buffet maneuvering. Hot & sour soup was watered down, seafood selection was minimal: clams, squid, FRIED crab legs, and cheesy variations of \"seafood\". Meat was tough, orange chicken was primarily just batter, and vegetables were cold. To be honest, I enjoyed the fruit and green tea iced cream the most. I paid $11.99 for 2 pieces of watermelon and a scoop of green tea iced cream. This place is not recommended by me."}
{"text":"Ever seen weird tv shows of people eating things we would find disgusting? I had that experience just to say I tried something unique! I have always been one to try something before I judge it and I tried a chicken foot here. Yes, chicken feet were at this buffet! Texture was like chewy chicken bones. Go figure. Breading on the chicken foot was not too bad.

This  place serves booze. 

I came here with a group of 8 people including a baby. Our server was was friendly.

We came here for dinner and it was about 17.00 per person excluding booze which I did not drink. :-)"}
{"text":"Bad seafood, bland flavors and food drenched in oil.  A couple years ago this was the go-to place for great Chinese food, and as much crab legs as you could fit into your stomach.

We went on a weekday, where possibly the dishes had been sitting since lunch.  Staff was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"This is the highest quality Chinese buffet that I have been to.  We were there at the tail end of the lunch rush, and the food was fresh and everything was well stocked.  The sushi was very good, it was probably my favorite part of the meal.  The seafood was good, but I am not much for crab legs, so cannot comment on them.  Overall the price is probably a bit on the high side if you do not go heavy on the pricier items (especially the crab legs).  However given the overall quality of the food, I think the price is worth it."}
{"text":"GORGEOUS restaurant. Wonderful server. Unfortunately, the oooh and aaahs of this place didn't match well with the food served. Sushi rice was not fresh, hard rice. The seafood: crab legs were very dry. The crawfish was even worse than the crab. It was extremely dry and I would call it out and say precooked and thawed out and reheated. The crawfish was unreal. If you know crawfish, you couldn't suck out anything. It was like tough, dry jerky. Food was flavorless and my Mother and I tried a variety of foods here. I wasn't a fan and unfortunately cannot recommend this place. My mother also agreed on the food. A great disappointment."}
{"text":"Peoria and Phoenix both seem to lack all-you-can-eat sushi places. After going to college in Tucson, where there were all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants galore, I felt really deprived moving back to Peoria. This is the closest thing I could find on the northwest part of the valley. 
Yes, as my friend once complained, it does smell like fish when you walk into the restaurant, but that's to be expected. It's an Asian seafood buffet! 
I think I have been here about 4-5 times, and I still haven't gotten sick yet. I'll be honest. There's been days where the sashimi has been really fresh like around 5pm today (a Sunday), but during the weekdays, there has been times when it hasn't been as fresh. It's just a gamble I guess, but I feel like it's best to come on a Sunday now. They seems to switch the variety of sushi rolls too each time I've been there.
Today, since it was Sunday, there was a lot of variety of cooked food too. There was stuffed crab, roasted duck, stuffed shrimp, roast beef, and crab legs. They had steak that could be cooked upon ordering. There was also a variety of Korean, Chinese and Japaneses noodles as well as some Dim Sum favorites. My dad ate mussels and fried frog legs if you can believe it. The mussels I understand, but I was pretty surprised they had fried frog legs. Disclaimer: my family will eat almost anything and everything - I guess one could call us \"taste adventurers.\" 
The variety of desserts was okay. They had carrot cake squares, bland flan, and bread pudding. They always carry green tea ice cream, which is pretty good. 
I'm praising the variety of food as you can tell. I'm not praising how amazing the food is. The food is overall just good for what it's worth. It cost about $55 for the three of us: my dad, my husband, and I to stuff our faces and go into food comas. Usually, that's how much my husband and I spend on 5-6 specialty rolls at a regular sushi bar."}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a buffet aficionado, and Pacific Seafood Buffet is definitely one of the best I've ever eaten at. They have everything from sushi to delicious Korean BBQ style spare ribs, and even some more unusual dishes like tripe and frog legs, but everything is very good."}
{"text":"Don't go after 8pm, no more crab legs put on buffet. Teppen grill not stocked, good amount of food was cold. If you go, it is a typicaly a great buffet. Off night. Sushi is fresh and teppen grill is fun. Fresh soups and crab legs on dinner side."}
{"text":"This place is great, the prices are extremely fair and the choices are dazzling you can easily come to this establishment and get FOOD DRUNK!!! 

I have visited on 4 occassions and each visit was great, the staff works hard to please you and the food is very well worth the visit, I look forward to my next adventure.....and it  is just that. So Many Choices."}
{"text":"We were looking for a buffet with crab legs and this place fit the bill.
It is a little far from home and we took the risk. 

I have not been to many Chinese buffets lately so I thought this place was a little pricier, at about $16 per person (weekday price), not including drinks.

I like trying new stuff so I was pleased with some of their dishes that I had never seen before in this kind of place (chicken feet, some sort of cow's stomach, escargot...)

Right at the end I noticed some shrimp ceviche that turned out to be very good. Most of the dishes I didn't try but they had a big selection.

I just wished they had the names for all the dishes, the sushi area didn't have them.

We didn't try the ice cream either... I was not very impressed with the desserts but they had what seemed to be an orange cake that was very good.
Also, they had these little disposable 1 oz containers whit what turned out to be like a shot of coffee flavored jello. That was interesting.. : )

Overall it was OK. Not sure if we will be back, tough..."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident. Pretty decent sushi for a buffet.

The set up has three areas:

1.  Sushi Bar
2.  Hibachi Grill
3.  Chinese buffet

Sushi Bar.  Excellent selection of your standard maki rolls.  You can ask for a special order, but the two sushi chefs were very busy and I did not bother to ask.  The selection of Sashimi was to die for.  I added a picture.  It was fresh and delightful.  The Nigiri was standard, but I did not want to eat to much rice.  They did not have any Unagi out, with bummed me out.  The spicy crab was excellent.

Hibachi Grill - Great selection of items.  I would say, there was more selection than the standard Hibachi Grill, some exotic stuff, calamari, clams, etc....  

Chinese Buffet -  Standard stuff and more.  Honestly it was so big, I did not get to all the items.  In fact, I could not identify most of the wierd creatures that were cooked and served up.  Crawfish, crab, oysters, shrimp (every variation imaginable).

Like I said, its a huge place and on a Sunday at 3 pm, it was slammed with lots of Asians, eating a lot of very weird stuff.  Since it was busy, all the food turned over quickly.  The staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Pacific Seafood is a really good buffet showcasing so much good food! They have a sushi station, hot meat station (BBQ short ribs, terri chicken), stir fry station, salad bar, dessert bars, and a wide assortment of veggies, seafood, and pasta dishes. 

The restaurant is clean and there is tons of seating so if you have a big party don't be afraid of finding space for everyone to sit together. Also, ask about a discount if you're a of a wise owl age. 

On Sunday's they have crab legs (it's a little bit pricier then other times but it's worth it if you like crab). They're pretty good about keeping the buffet food full and steaming hot."}
{"text":"Update 04/25/2018

Sometimes the sushi is 1-2 stars depending on how fresh it is.  The food is hit or miss that day depending on how fresh it is.  I was there at 11:30 AM (shortly after opening) and the sushi was nasty.  It must have been from the night before.  However at 12 noon, I see the sushi chef putting out new fresh and tasty sushi.

One day the hot and sour soup is fresh and delicious (4-stars).  Another day it is yucky and gross (1  star).  It depends who makes it that day.

Service can be horrid.  Waitress for my area isn't even there most of the time and cannot be found.  I bring it to the attention of cashier/hostess that I need service.  Asian waitress with black hair/blonde highlights finally comes for help once.  I hadn't seen her anywhere in the dining room the whole time.  When ready to checkout and get the bill, waitress is looking in my direction 4-5 times and every time I wave to her she purposes shies away.  Just trying to get decent service here.  Only time I get service is when I approach the cashier/hostess for assistance.  Couldn't even get the final check from the waitress.

So anyways, I obviously I didn't tip her as service was the worst I've seen anywhere.  Waitresses don't normally ignore you when they are looking at you and you wave.  This is the first time in 20 years of dining, I've experienced this.  I've been tipping 20%+, which is pretty high for a buffet, every time I come here except this last visit.

I forgot my phone cell there as I went out to my car as I was so frustrated trying to get someone to help me, I forgot.  I quickly came back and found she threw my phone on the floor and it cracked the screen protector and the Apple cover that I bought with it.  I ended up having to replace the screen protector and getting a new case.  Mean people here.  Watch out.

I wasn't going to even write this review if she hadn't thrown my new iPhone 10 on the floor."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Place stinks. Food was bad. Chicken smell bad. Barely any sushi. Servers were rude. Be careful. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Not Very Fresh....

The food just isn't very fresh at all... I don't prefer buffets since this is the standard operating procedure at most asian buffets... 

The sushi bar could be cool but there isn't much for labels to decipher what the rolls are. Some say one thing and then have 3 different rolls in there. That would be fine if you don't have any allergies, but for me the crab, lobster and shrimp are poison so I cannot risk it when the staff doesn't speak much English to ask. 

All in all it is what it is and lots of people like this place. 3 stars is pretty fair."}
{"text":"For a seafood buffet in the middle of the desert, this place is decent. For the amount of seafood and sushi you can eat, the price is not that bad if one stops to think about how much they've actually consumed in price. It's a clean place with more Chinese dishes which I'm not a fan of. I'm not too fond of the other customers who stock up their plates with crabs and leave none for others. Seafood isn't super fresh (as expected. We're in the desert!), but it isn't dry either. Very clean and without tacky decor. I frequent this place quite often with family."}
{"text":"I thought this place was horrible. The rest room smelled like urine and the carpet was completely worn out and gross looking. Even one of the blinds was broken. As for the buffet the food labels were mostly unreadable which was bad because I usually had no idea what the slop there was. I thought everything tasted bad except the crab legs, clams and bok choy. The NE clam chowder seemed like a warm bowl of cream with very little in it."}
{"text":"Why don't they fill up their hot plates fully with food? Much of the food looked like it has been sitting out for a long time. Saw a couple of flies lingering. Huge price hike since the 9.95 price and mostly it's for the sushi and sashimi items which were so so."}
{"text":"This is mediocre Chinese food at best.  Their sushi) I k ow sushi is Japenese)  has lettuce and celery in it WTF? Also the bbq stuff looks like it sits out a bit too long.  The food itself is less than stellar mostly mushy and bland,  whats supposed to be spicy is far from it.  Many sauces are watered down also. Some food is pretty cold even though it's i  the heat trays  

Wait staff was friendly and attentive but food is sub par.  Price was not so great either.  Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here for lunch a couple weeks ago, and we thought it was great! I'm not a big fan of buffets; but, my brother is and so he usually drags me with him. This is the first one I've been to that actually became a favorite! 

Very spacious with comfortable seating. Excellent service from our waiter. I wish I asked for his name. 

I never eat the sushi from buffets I go to, but this sushi was surprisingly tasty! All of the seafood was delicious, actually. I was more stuck on the chow mein and the variety of Asian food they served. It was a mix of goodies and we enjoyed all of it. 

... and all of this for only $16! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i live at arizona,and  like this buffet,because i love sea food.

i recommend this place for seafood buffet."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that \"World Buffet\" (it's just a few miles south of this restaurant) is a better option than Pacific Seafood Buffet.

From the hostess that doesn't look you in the eyes when speaking to the illiterate staff, the service is mediocre.  For almost $17/ person on a Sunday afternoon, the selection doesn't vary that much from what you get at World Buffet for around $10/ person.

The sushi was a bit disappointing as it lacked options with yellowfin tuna, and the crab legs and crawfish were somewhat overcooked.  Some items were also on the room-temperature side.  The Korean BBQ beef ribs were my favorite thing there.  They also offer a Mongolian BBQ area, some items that you'd find at Panda Express, soups, a dessert area, and some tubs of ice cream (including a Green Tea flavor!).  

So, again, I suggest sticking with World Buffet as that is what I'll be doing for now on."}
{"text":"I've been going to \"Pac Sea\" (that's what the cool kids call it...not really) for a long time, and even though it's quite a trek to go there from Glendale it's always been well worth the trip.

There is such a wide variety to choose from, and the food is always fresh. The short ribs are really good and they make the best cheese wontons I've ever had so far... Also, the staff is really nice too - I've never had bad service the numerous times I've been there. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Yay! Now I don't have to go all the way down to Chandler for Pacific Seafood! I'm a little late with this review....but let me tell you, I was ecstatic when I drove by on Bell and saw the \"Opening Soon\" sign on the building. I loved the Chandler location, but hated making the trek!

Glendale Pac Seafood has everything the Chandler one does, except this one is nicer, newer, and super clean! Be careful on going on Friday evenings...this place gets packed, so I'd recommend getting take-out if you're just wanting to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"This a basically a Chinese buffet with sushi and a bit more seafood choices than your typical buffet. It is good for a buffet. I was expecting a little higher end seafood selection, which it wasn't but it still was good. If you like Chinese buffets, you will like this place. It is kinda smelly though and the workers are kind of intense."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service is ok. Crab legs are just the same with crazy buffet. Dinner at 16/head adult. Quite pricey."}
{"text":"The food was good. It's not just seafood as the name suggests. It's what you will find at most Chinese buffets that have a Japanese sushi bar. The waitress was full of friendly energy."}
{"text":"My last visit was over 6 years ago and it's still going strong!  Me and 3 kids went her tonight because we were craving Chinese and we were starving.  An Ahwatukee buffet had closed down so I did a search here and decided to spring for this buffet for my kids.  They don't normally eat a lot so this was an exception to spend $8 for each.  The price isn't so bad because if we go for a casual Chinese place, it'd be about the same price, only a single entree, not the smorgasboard they had here tonight.  We went on a weekend for dinner around 7pm and although not greeted we only had to wait for 10 minutes.  So many choices. There's the dim sum (shu mai, sticky rice, bbq buns, pot stickers and more, sushi (sashimi, futomaki,oysters!, seaweed salad, spicy octupus-all made fresh in front of you), stir fry to order, pork, frog legs, salmon, sole, beef and ginger, crab legs (too cumbersome so I only had 2), salad bar with fruit, shrimp in all forms (steamed, chilled, deep fried, breaded, stuffed), lo mein, fried rice, braised chinese veggies, beef and broccoli, dessert bar ( I skipped this since I get plenty of ice cream and cake at home + selection was nothing I liked.), but I did eat the apple strudel which was a nice finish to my meal.  In all, $45 + tip.  Done in one hour.  Although the water wasn't refilled and the table wasn't cleared during our stay, I was there for the food and my kids and I thoroughly enjoyed our special meal.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes is of asian origin and excellent.  Lots of shrimp dishes.  The sushi bar selection is basic, but good for a buffet.   Grilled dishes such korean kal-bi and asparagus brings something a little different. 

Lunches are really good deal.  Dinner adds additional dishes such as snow crab legs, frog legs, snails and sashimi along with a higher price.

Staff is good with some of the wait staff working there for years."}
{"text":"Pretty good as far as buffets go. Was skeptical about the sushi station, but items are fresh and delicious! Had my usual buffet circuit : plates 1 (sushi), plate 2 (crab and BBQ meats),  plate 3 (stir fry and dim sum miscellaneous + veggies), plate 4 hot deserts), round 5 (green tea ice cream). Great selection of food.  Can be pricey for dinner, but lunches are affordable."}
{"text":"Tonight was so good. The sashimi was cut perfect again , last time it was frozen and cut bad. But the mgr made it right. 

I  get the rolls which are always consistently on point. 

They have so much delicious food I wish I could try it all. 

You won't be sorry if you give it a try."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly.  There is alot of seafood choices but I really didn't like the flavor in their food. I wouldn't go back for the price of $18"}
{"text":"My absolute go-to for splurging. Enough Chinese food to keep the family satisfied and plenty of seafood choices. Been going here for years and it is a little pricey, but the quality and selection makes it still a great value!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but I ate dinner here with some friends and the short ribs seemed so under cooked, sushi bar had flies buzzin' around it, and the service room for ever to take away the plates that we finished, they need to figure something out because  the money's ain't worth it anymore. Poor service and disgusting food!"}
{"text":"This is the best buffet I've ever been to in Phoenix.  The food was delicious, hot and fresh - row after row of tasty selections.  Items like sushi, hand rolls, crab legs, stuffed oysters and the SHRIMP!  Shrimp for days, shrimp every way you could want it and some ways you didn't even know about.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I didn't look around at the décor because I was too entranced by all of the delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress (while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant) recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet.  She was the BEST waitress we've had in a super long time and extremely honest with us when we asked her where she eats seafood and she said, \"Pacific ~ but please don't tell anyone\"..  

If you're looking for a great Asian style seafood buffet, this place is it! It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas, but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ!

I actually like this buffet better than the Rio.  It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price.  Albeit the decor isn't as nice, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, and we don't have to go all the way to Las Vegas to eat at a great seafood buffet ~ it's in our own back yard!

This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a generous and decent sashimi/sushi bar. For dinner and lunch you'll find a huge selection of freshly cooked food to choose from like snow crab, sea bass, mussels, oysters, many different kinds of shrimp, Peking duck, escargot and so much more.

Since this place is still fairly new, you don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.

This is a great place to go when we are thinking about eating seafood, sushi and/or Chinese. 

I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 stars, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Asian buffets in the area and also the only one my family goes to repeatedly.  Even my husband, who usually hates buffets of any kind, likes this one.  They have a good variety of foods, including a sushi section (sushi is decent for a buffet, but not super great), a Mongolian grill area where you pick your raw foods and hand them off to be cooked for you, and the normal hot foods/salad/dessert buffet section.  They seem to keep a good eye on the food and will refresh or refill dishes regularly.  At certain times, (I think during weekend dinner time, not sure if they have it on weekdays) they have crab legs.  Even my picky kids can eat fries and chicken nuggets (the sweet and sour chicken minus the sauce) if they don't want anything else.  The restaurant is kept pretty tidy, and the staff are friendly and usually quick to clear plates and bring drink refills when you need them.  

I do have to give a major thumbs down to the ladies bathroom because once they were completely out of hand soap (gross!, but luckily I carry antibacterial wipes and gel)  I'm convinced it was just a short temporary outage, since I saw one of the counter ladies walk in there after me, but their bathroom definitely needs to be checked on more often.  Another time the hand soap was just out in a messy giant 2-gallon container that I had to lift and tip out on my hand to dispense for me and my kids.  It would be nice (not to mention an easy fix) if they just replaced the wall-mounted dispensers or just got little hand-soap pump-bottles at a grocery store for less than $2.  

(***Seriously, Pacific Seafood Buffet, if you're reading this, just drop the 2 bucks on a freakin' soap pump!!!  And please police the bathroom more often, especially during busy times!  Thank you and good day.  PS - Your food is yummy.)

I would have rated it 3.5 stars because of the bathroom, but since I think the soap outage was temporary, and the food and service are so good, it's bumped up to 4.

One more thing, you can get the buffet to-go, but you will pay way too much for it.  They will weigh your food and charge a per pound price.  It costs extra if you choose to get takeout from the sushi section or the special seafood selection (i.e. crab legs and other specialty seafood dishes).  If you choose to only get takeout from the regular hot foods section you will be charged less.  They will tell you all of this up front when you ask for takeout, so it's not like they are trying to swindle you or anything.  Just know that you will get the best value if you only go here to eat in."}
{"text":"This is not a seafood restaurant but rather a marginal Chinese buffet with some low grade sushi mixed in.  Not sure how they get away with calling themselves a seafood buffet.  I've had better, fresher seafood at Long John Silvers if that tells you anything.  Ridiculous prices for a Chinese buffet too.  A few hours after visiting this establishment I found myself needing to spend an extended period in my bathroom, probably the sushi..."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers that this restaurant is more of a Chinese food buffet than a seafood buffet.  I liked the food well enough (you can't go wrong with deep-fried shrimp!).  I've had better, but overall I enjoyed my meal, I'd go back. The desert choices were rather pathetic, but I don't go to buffets to eat desert."}
{"text":"Very very good food.  LOVED the frog legs.  Cant really comment on the sushi because I never made it that far over to tell you the truth.  Maybe next time but wow this food is fantastic here."}
{"text":"I find it's oddly rare to discover a good Chinese buffet. In that light, Pacific Seafood is almost there. The variety is fairly impressive and dishes that are good are actually pretty good. But there enough food out there that's just dried out and not fresh to keep the rating from getting any higher than a middle of the road - OK. In the absence of a better Chinese buffet option, we'd come back if the desire was strong enough. Otherwise we'll continue our search."}
{"text":"Most of the food was ok, the Mongolian BBQ was the best out of everything. I got way too much food and didn't want to waste it so I wanted to take some home for later. I knew it wasn't going to be free, but they wanted to charge $5.99/pound plus $16.88 for dinner. That was WAY too much money for me. I don't know if I'll come back here, the food wasn't worth the price"}
{"text":"Friendly servers with perfect timing. Clean food, excellent sushi selection. Food isn't drowned in oil. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Some authentic dishes, others very bland, or next to what you could buy at grocery store.  
Price high, but I guess buffets charge high. 
Blue crab were cooked to death. 
Crab legs were ok..
Matcha ice cream worst ever.   
Fairly to moderately clean, considering the amount 9f fried food.  I grazed the wall with my arm, and could feel that oily sticky feeling."}
{"text":"Been here a few times really great food but last 3 time there has been almost no seas good at all no crab just clams and small selection of sushi and octopus but again the food is great and fresh and not too expensive."}
{"text":"There was a long line when we first got here (which is expected on a Saturday night), but I'm so glad that we chose to stay & wait ! The food was good, sooooooo much to choose from !"}
{"text":"This place truly is the best Chinese buffet in the state of Arizona.  Place is packed with customer.  They're constantly bringing out new food to feed the crowd. That means you're getting fresh food not food that's been reheated for 3 to 4 days in a row. After eating here you'll have a higher standard was going to Chinese buffet. I drive all the way from Ahwatukee just to have lunch here."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the rating is so high. I looked at the reviews before I came here, so I felt pretty safe. The crab legs were so bad. I'd love to pay more but serve me something that worth it. The legs were light, the meat was not tender and all sticked to the shells. The legs looked pretty good outside but when I ate one, tried one more, I just left the whole dish. So disappointed. The seafood buffet, everything is good except for the seafood"}
{"text":"(Read fast it's brief) I just got sick after eating the food over there!! The buffet has great category of foods. It just that silver-plates and bowls at that night were probably like predicted wasn't not rinse in a crowded night. But well again I did sipped thru the bowl my fault that I felt like that would not see another day thankfully I'm better now. But people should try to go out to America restaurant and have it for take out and eat it in their household on a cold Saturday Night like I was in."}
{"text":"They had crab legs, sushi, longan, escargot and frog legs!!!  It don't get any more hardcore than that!"}
{"text":"Dear God! It is the worst food I've ever had. The service is terrible. Only saw our waitress twice not because she was bad but because they were extremely under staffed. The sushi which is the reason someone told me to go there was disgusting. They salted the rice! Who in the hell salts sushi rice. Not to mention they barely had anything made cause the guy showed no speed or enthusiasm in making anything. Finally the crab legs. You are charged the dinner price for these premium items (sushi and crab legs) yet they are never out there to get. It was so bad I saw 2 people running, yes you heard me correctly. 2 people were running to get the carb legs and they were gone in a matter of moments. Only 4 or 5 people got some. Then you had to wait another 20 minutes for the next stampede. The worst!!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good and everyone was very nice but was it coincidence that we were both glued to the toilet that night?  Might give it another try but need to give the flora a chance to rebuild in my gut first."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant love the food there great customer service it's just perfect seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"This was really really bad, from the amount of food left behind on the plates of other guests I should've known.
I'm leaving here and I'm still hungry, probably have to grab a burger somewhere.

Im very picky, ill admit that, my wife is not, she'll eat anything, and this was the first time I've seen her leave so much food on the plate."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Chinese buffet fan.  Pacific Seafood Buffet runs somewhere in the middle of the pack.  Here's why:

The sushi is probably the best part of the whole buffet.  It seems to be always fresh and I always see someone behind the counter prepping more.  I've never been disappointed at this station.  8 out of 10

The rest of the buffet is hit and miss.  IF the food is fresh (and they have it prepared out), it's OK at best.  Some dishes are over-seasoned (too salty for my taste).  I tend to judge by the Orange Chicken.  Ususally, it's a hot selling dish and has to be prepared more often because it's constantly selling out.  On a scale of 1-10, I'd give it about a 6,  

They also have a Mongolian Grill (again one of my favorite things normally) but it's kinda blah here.  Not enough seasoning choices for my tastes.  3 out of 10 stars for the grill.   

Deserts I could care less about.  I don't go to a Chinese buffet for their desert cart.  If they have a little something to nibble on afterwards, fine.  If not, I'm OK with that too.  I really don't look for it.  

Service here is hit and miss too.  After the hostess seats you, you have to wait for the server to order your drinks.  Sometimes this can take a while.  Also clearing of the table and refills (and getting your check) could take a bit too.  I'll give the service 5 out of 10 stars.  

The place is also WAAAAY overpriced!  $18 for dinner??  I really don't care about price usually as long as the food and service is good.  Sorry guys but for that price this place has got to be much better for me to return.  

I've been here a number of times.  I just don't go 1 time and write a review.  The food and service has gotten steadily worse with each visit.  I'm not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better buffets in the valley and possibly THE best on the West side.  I've been here twice now for lunch with Rand, Norm and Mike.  The food and service have always been good.  Because they have so many items, several go off the beaten path in entrees and desserts which means everybody should find something they like."}
{"text":"We were greeted immediate.  We got seated for all 6 of us.  There are so many things to pick from.  I got noodles, rice, chicken, grilled meats, dim sum, fish, etc.  Everything was good.  The service was pretty good too.  1 con was that the tables were so close together that we keep bumping into the table behind us and vice versa."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. It is pretty good. The price is really reasonable. Discount for seniors and kids under three are free. There are so many selections. I can't complain. I would go back."}
{"text":"There are better seafood buffets at the Casinos especially Harrahs in Maricopa Fri. & Sat. nites and Casino Arizona Wed. & Thurs. nites.  
And If your vegetarian your out of luck at Pacific. Everything has pork or chicken in it.  And the snow crab isn't that meaty. Harrahs probably has the best snow crab in Ariz.!"}
{"text":"After not eating at this restaurant for six months, we decided to give them another try today. 

I wish I could give them a positive review. Unfortunately, I would be lying to you and I don't lie when it comes to your dining dollars and more importantly your health.

First the positive...the decor is boringly the same. The number of clientelle should have provided excellent service...not so.

Next the negative...the food is unappetizing at best and dangerous at worst. The food temperature on the line was below 140 degrees...that is a threshold temperature for bacterial control in food. The temperature in the food (nearer 110 degrees) is flatly dangerous. Bacteria grow very rapidly below 140 degrees.The food handler was handling the food with bare hands which provides even greater probability for food contamination.

Food quality was poor. Tasteless (did I already mention that?) Poorly prepared, inadequately seasoned and poorly presented.

To top of the above we were allowed to pay nearly $40.00 for lunch. 

My advice, unless you want to chance contracting food poisoning or have money to piss away on poor food, is to run as far and as fast as you can from this place."}
{"text":"Never going back again. This restaurant has a cockroach problem. There was one walking all over the chocolate syrup bottle by the ice cream freezer so my brother called over a worker and she immediately freaked out and swept it into a towel. She came back a few moments later and told us that they've been having bug problems and not to tell anyone"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place to eat I've been to so far in Glendale. The girl that waited on us could've cared less about customer service.  The rice, undercooked. And I'm pretty sure the crab legs were a few days past their expiration date. It's safe to say I'm not going back anytime soon. 

Update:  Went back thinking it might have changed. Nope. Still sucks."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and not one time could they keep up with the crab legs. The send 1 tray of crab legs and there are 6 people on each side waiting for them to drop the new pan. If you are here to eat crab legs.....Plan on making it an all night event. Good luck finding someone that understands \"you are out of crab legs\". All they know how to do is smile and shake their heads yes...But they dont understand. Very over priced, 20.00 for dinner and the quality of sushi is 3 stars at best. Hope this is helpful."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian buffet in the Phoenix area, especially if you like seafood. Cavernous restaurant with questionable cleanliness, but plentiful diners here insure adequate food turnover. Decent sushi, unlimited sashimi. Many offerings of Crab, shrimp, clams and various fish.  Steamed crab legs seems to be the most popular, but the law of the jungle prevails, with the most aggressive diners lining up to scoop as much as they can on their plate (or plates for the completely shameless).  Reasonable price, good value. No alcohol served ( which is probably a good thing given the alcohol fueled brawl potential at the crab station )."}
{"text":"Seafood a plenty. The quality is somewhat better than the other buffet joints. Big selection of oysters, mussels, shrimp, salmon, and crab legs. Also the usual buffet food. Small dessert bar as well, Great service will keep you coming back. Expect to spend about 20 a pop."}
{"text":"It is good if you want to do a quick cleanse.  I have eaten here twice and within two hours after leaving I was making frequent visits to my local commode.

Ironically, or not, these two occasions were on Mondays.

Are we reheating foods that have sat under heat lamps the previous day?

Their egg drop is decent."}
{"text":"i have been coming to pacific seafood for at least a good 6 years now and they never disappoint. at this point their frog legs, squid and crabs legs have become a sort of comfort food for me. i love their sushi and sashimi selection as well. sometimes the biggest issue is customers that want to take EVERY SINGLE LAST crab leg for themselves but they are pretty quick to restock the items anyway. love this place and have been going back for a while now :)"}
{"text":"My friend and myself both got sick hours after dining. Stay away folks. The hot food was cold sushi was hot. The soup was the only decent item even the dessert was off"}
{"text":"Good food and wide variation with fair price. Their place is great to hang out with family or friends. Will come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for nearly 13 years now after my beloved Chinese foreign exchange sister took me here for some real Chinese food. It's not like I live nearly this buffet either! It's just THAT GOOD. There are so many options; a whole sushi bar, Mongolian grill, and ice cream station. I am never disappointed when I dine here. I just wish my sister was still here to dare me to eat the chicken feet..."}
{"text":"Food was great. The crab is what I mainly came here for, but it was disappointing. The crab tasted very plain and unsweet, it's as if the chefs didn't cook it with some salt. The rest of the food was a bonus that made this place go from a 3 star to a 4 for me was the sushi bar which was really fresh and offered all you can eat sashimi. I also enjoyed the galbi Korean short ribs they had! I'll come back if I'm craving those things, but not for the snow crab."}
{"text":"no good at all.... not a fan of cheap chinese buffets. quality of the food and the selection are pretty bad"}
{"text":"You know I have defended this place to death, but tonight I'm sad to report that it was more than an off night for them today. It will be a long time before  we return. The sashimi looked slimy, didnt eat it. The crab was salty, tolerated it.

But the wings were raw,  and bleeding. There was no manager on site . They called him and they took a measly 3$ off the bill. No comp on his meal,no incident report.

Is that the going rate for serving raw meat?  It's a shame you don't care for your loyal customers. Neither quality or service,  I hope we don't get sick."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. This is always our go to place if we want sushi meat dishes or made to order meals, as well as drinks.  It is always clean as well and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This has been a go to place for us for many years. Unfortunately even though they've raised the prices only modestly they've also cut back on the offerings. I tried it once on a weekday. The lunch selection was disappointing to me, but only because I prefer the all day Sunday dinner selection. I love sashimi, and they don't disappoint. Gone are the frog legs and roast duck they used to have. They have a fair selection of Chinese style food for those less adventurous, and even have green tea ice cream. Don't miss the hot and sour soup, better than most places. I'd be willing to pay a bit more if they upgraded their offerings. Better than Jasmine Tokyo. I love raw fish, and if I wanted to eat rice with it I'd add rice. The staff is very efficient at clearing your plates and readily available to refill your drinks. This is a busy place, sometimes it can be just a bit noisy and it's fine for kids. There's a room up front for large groups."}
{"text":"If I want to see everyone I know and have not seen for a long time= perfect location for that awkward accident reunions. -.-

I'm a small girl so buffet is not my top pick for dinner because it's normally crowded.  I like intimate dinner with friends, especially the ones I haven't seen for a while.

The reason why my friend chose this as our dinner destination is because she love seafood.

For a buffet- this place is really good with a variety of seafood dishes from crawfish to crab legs to salted shrimps on a stick to sashimi.

Just a good combination of all sort of food.  Good fruit bar, dessert bar.

It is a clean place and both time there I had a really good experience with the wait staff.   I didn't get the rude fortune-cookies kick out so my friends and I just sat there to catch up for a couple of hours.  

Just over all good. I normally come on the weekend so this is strictly for weekenders- I'm not sure if it is as good during the week."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to do a buffet for Father's Day and choose this place.  I expected the place to be crowded and more pricey than usual for the holiday.  Correct on both accounts.  The parking  lot was jammed full of cars.  Nevertheless we were greeted and seated immediately.  Our first stop is always the sushi/sashimi area where everything is fresh.  Salmon and tuna sashimi and spicy tuna roll are good.  On the opposite side are the tempera, seaweed salad, seared tuna, raw salmon and tuna and pickled daikon.  They had roast duck which was a treat, King crab legs and crayfish.  The last two items appeared to be favorites of the dining patrons.  Plenty of seafood including steamed fish, deep fried fish, salmon, clams, calamari and mussels.  There is a small dim sum area with steamed buns, potstickers, and pineapple rice.  You can find soups, fries, chow mein and noodles, and salads.  Desserts include chocolate cake, cookies, nuts, and ice cream.  Drinks are extra.  Seniors get a 10% discount.  Very filling and good quality."}
{"text":"Food was great and tasted pretty fresh to me. I love a good buffet. On Christmas Day we went to another restaurant and didn't get our order taken so even though we ordered drinks we left that place and said C-Fu-later and went to this place. They were very busy but we were seated in under 5 mins. I took one star away because the staff forgot about our drinks until we reminded her and she promptly brought them.

The snow crab was grabbed very quick because the locals have the timing of them down. They were very fresh and easy to open up (crab is my favorite). 

Lots of great food choices including the bbq station that we took advantage of. Didn't have a chance to get a bowl of ice cream (the line was long) but I tried a spoonful of my wife's and it was good.

I shouldn't go to a buffet very often but next time we want Chinese food and a lot of it I will come here. Definitely looking forward to it next time!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet has an extensive selection including vegetarian.  The food was hot and tasty. The  reason for  3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is due to it being a buffet.  Overall restaurant was a good cheap find."}
{"text":"I love pacific sea food!! My favorite are the frog legs!! We will definitely go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Toooo pricey for the quality of food! It does have very few decent tasting food here and there but I wouldn't suggest coming here again, not even half as good for the price. Just all around pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here usually on the weekends and for a family of 3 it's about 60 dollars each time. It's not bad with 20 dollars a person.  The food wasn't too bad, it's a great place for people that loves seafood. Their crab legs are fresh and tasted good. It didn't taste frozen. The place is clean and the servers are very nice, they always came and cleaned out the dishes, gave us napkins and always filled up our drinks. They have a sushi bar there as well. Definitely worth the money if you like buffets. I believe it is cheaper to come in the afternoon on weekdays."}
{"text":"This place was clean and fairly inexpensive. There are many options to choose from including sushi, crab and Mongolian BBQ. Even my 5 year old enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chinese place in the east valley phoenix area. They have sushi and different types of special depending on the day. Staff is freindly the and The place is clean.Not really the bathroom is filthy but its the best its gonna get."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. We got there all fresh food being brought out. So much food and variety. The sushi chef is great and very friendly"}
{"text":"This is one of the better buffets in AZ because the food is actually pretty decent.

That being said, this place has really good sushi and a wide selection of seafood. Dinner on weekdays are around $16 and weekends are a couple dollars more. Drinks are not included in the price. If you want to just eat all you can eat sushi and some asian food then I suggest you only come for lunch where it's only ten bucks which is a really good deal.

I always come for dinner though because I like to eat seafood. The crab legs are not that great though. They taste old and flavorless so do not come expecting it to be awesome. On the weekends they taste a little better but there usually is a huge line for them and everyone takes it all within the first minute of it coming out. It's seriously a pain to deal with.

They also have raw oysters which are decent if they haven't been sitting out for too long. It's a hit or miss because some of them taste fishy while others taste fresh.

As for the crawfish, it's frozen and then cooked but it's not too bad considering we do live in AZ.

The sushi is the best asian buffet sushi you will eat in AZ hands down and I've been to almost all the Asian buffets in AZ.

I also like the short ribs here that they have located near the grill and they also have fresh strawberries and an assortment of typical Asian dishes that are tasty.

I generally skip this though because I come for the seafood and sushi. Some other seafood dishes are escargot, stone crabs, shrimp cocktail that u have to peel, cold mussels on ice, steamed clams, dry salmon, steamed fish, sometimes fried frog legs, sashimi, popcorn shrimp, clam chowder, and some weird baby scallop thing that doesn't really have any flavor. Everyone should try this buffet at least once to see if you like it! I really like this buffet, it's very clean and a bit more upscale than other seafood Asian buffets."}
{"text":"No Mas no mas, but Lord that was good!  Endless quantity of good variety, better than usuall local buffet quality food. Though Norm R who took me for my birthday thought they were having \"an off night\", it was the best buffet I've been to in Phoenix in some years, surpassed perhaps only by the casino buffet at I think Wild Horse Pass of a couple years ago.  Probably six variations on shrimp, attractive and tasty fresh made sushi/sashimi, unlimited crab legs (though I've never wanted to work that hard for that small quantity of meat!), salmon and at least 2 other whole fish offerings, a small \"meat bar\" where you chose your own small small steak or other and had it grilled to your specs, an absolutely perfect, mouth-wateringly juicy prime rib, numerous asian and veggie dishes of no particularly great distinction, but all well-made and satisfying.  Bonus points to the staff  who kept our water glasses full and plates promptly cleared throughout our stay, despite having a very full house to attend to.  

At I believe roughly $20 each for adult evening dining, it wasn't as cheap as some asian buffets in the area, but the quantity, as in sheer number of offerings and quality was superior to most. Considering the servings are unlimited in portion and number, it's a bargain for big eaters, and  suffering from that bent to \"get one's money's worth\" at an all you can eat establishment, I would be one BIG eater if I ate there often, as were a number of the other customers at the well-filled establishment on the night we went. 

Note there are significantly less expensive prices for lunch, for children's dining, and a senior discount as well.  You can also find coupons for additional discounts on their web site.

Avoid the temptation to try a little bit of everything - there's just too much!  But go hungry, eat heartily, and leave well-filled and satisfied, hopefully feeling as I did that \"Lord, that was good!\" Based on my experience: Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am not impressed. The so-called coconut shrimp is cold and watery with only a hint of coconut. The oil used to deep fry the fried shrimp is so overpowering that I can barely taste the shrimp and the oil used is not very tasty. The garlic bread was cold, wet and squishy. A key ingredient was obviously left out of the fried rice, soy sauce so you must add your own that only makes it cold. The calamari is like trying to eat a chunk of leather wrapped in rubber. The server took more than 20 minutes to take the empty plates and offer refills for our Dr Pepper drinks. The Dr Pepper was good at least. People that give this place a good review obviously have very low standards. Chinese food buffets used to have great food in the valley but now they all seem to be the same. I buy Chinese food from the Flaming Wok at the food court at Desert Sky mall and they have always served perfection. I measure all other Chinese food by the flavors and perfectly cooked food Flaming Wok offers. The only other place that offers food as close to perfect is the buffet at Talking Stick Resort."}
{"text":"As a carnivore, this place is great.  I usually go on lunch since it's about 10 dollars.  I always get water since I'm a fake healthy person.  Getting to eat as much meat and veggies as I want is a dream, especially the short ribs.  For that value, fast food can't even keep up.  That alone deserves the 5 stars.  Haven't found a bigger/better buffet with this quality yet.  I'm not a fan of seafood by the way and I still eat here haha."}
{"text":"Good food, way too costly.   We have been there a few times, it is a good place to eat a lot of Sushi cheaply.  The Sushi is good quality but often runs out and takes up to 20 minutes to be restocked, I guess they hope people will get full.

The last time we were there they decided to raise their prices WHILE we were eating, They don't give you the bill until you are done eating, when we arrived right after they opened that day it was the normal price, 80 minutes later when we got the bill they had a much higher price of $18 for kids and $24 for adults, I was shocked by this.  Well I guess it was a really busy day and while we were eating they posted a small hand written sign below the normal prices saying that today the prices would be higher.  There was no difference in the food.  

I told them I would not pay the higher price, that it was unfair and not disclosed.  We had a large party and it made almost $100 difference.  The workers were almost crying because they said that the owner was very mean and would deduct any shortfall from their meager pay.  I don't know if this was a ploy or if the owner was really this abusive of their immigrant workforce who did not know any better.  I told them to get the owner on the phone, they did and after 5 minutes of argument she finally relented and let me pay the normal, still very high price.

I won't be going back to this place.  I only give them 2 stars instead of 1 because a few of the dishes are really good, and they have a large selection of desserts."}
{"text":"Great buffet. You can't beat the price and the quality of the food.  The crablegs were amazing and that coffee dessert was to die for. Everything was fresh and replenished regularly."}
{"text":"Best Asian Buffet in the east valley.  Food was fresh and I had a late lunch.  2pm on a Thursday this placed was slammed.  Fresh food and believe it or not this establishment was clean, especially for a buffet."}
{"text":"The prices aren't bad, especially at lunch.  

The food overall was very good, the seafood dishes were good.  My favorite is that day they had clam chowder, yes clam chowder at a chinese buffet.  It was a wonderful clam chowder!  Add some green onions to it and it was complete.  I rarely go back for seconds on dishes but I got seconds of both the clam chowder and the coconut shrimp (shell-less) and the custard tarts.  Try adding ice cream on top of the custard tart and you'll have something that will change your dessert life. 

The sushi is only ok. I didn't try the americanized chinese food, but the chinese food was very good.

And to top if off, the server was very nice and attentive to us."}
{"text":"This is one of the best values I have found for my money in a long time. I have been here many times through out the years. If you drive by and see the parking lot is full run on in. I have wanted to go when it wasn't busy but the food did not appear to be as fresh so I left. 

The sushi is very good, limited in selection but they have my favorites so it's great for me. The crab legs are amazing! Last lime I went I had 2 plates of sushi, 2 plates of crab legs and a plate of egg rolls, pineapple sticky rice, and crab puffs. If I would have ordered all of that at a restaurant it would have easily cost me $60 for everything I ate, but I paid less than $20. 

This place is a gem and I highly recommend it:)"}
{"text":"We love this place! It has all my bf and I's favorites, good sushi, FRIED CRAB, shrimp, wanton, clam chowder, the desserts, orange chicken, baked salmon. YUM! it's nice to see that there's a sushi chef right in the middle that takes care of you, they are fast on the turns overs. Price is just affordable and great! Love coming here for dinner on a really hungry day and want a hefty meal. They also have authentic Chinese food on the side with chicken feet, pork buns,etc. Only thing I wasn't a fan of this place is the crawfish since they are not fresh. There are good days and bot so good days on the seafood. 
This place is a bit ran down with the seats/ tables but such a big \"whole in the wall\" feel for me, so it isn't really a big deal for me. Will always come back!"}
{"text":"Pass this restaurant at least once a week and finally, after 6 months of living in Phoenix, I decided to give this place a try and I am so glad I did. I came at opening and was the first person there. I was seated immediately by a friendly hostess. 

Place on the inside is very large, but not lots of space in the seating areas as they have so many tables to accommodate the crowds that probably come in here. Since I came at opening, the place was very clean and organized. All the dishes were filled with hot freshly cooked food and I had the option to eat anything on the buffet. 

They had everything that I've seen at other Chinese buffets and new items as well. They had shrimp dishes, chicken dishes, fish, soups, several different noodle dishes, steamed and fried rice, potstickers, tofu dishes, green beans, mushroom dish, wings, egg rolls, fries, sushi, grilled meat dishes, different sushi salads, seaweed salad, Mongolian BBQ, desserts and much more. They had so much stuff that It was hard to decide what to get, so I got a little of my favorite dishes. Everything was well flavored, not too overcooked on the meats, and fresh. I would definitely come back here again when I'm having a craving for a variety of Chinese dishes. 

Pros:
1. Large area to accommodate large groups. 
2. Lots of food to choose from. There definitely wasn't a lack of choices and more than enough food for the people that came during lunchtime. Plus they were constantly checking on the food and bringing out more as it was needed. 
3. Friendly staff. Even though they didn't really do any talking, when our waitress came around, she did smile and always was courteous towards us. 

Cons:
My only complaint here is the price. I paid $26 for two adults at lunchtime. This did include the tip, but since I only had one plate and my guest had two, this seemed really high for me and we didn't even get a drink. I can understand dinner maybe being that price since they offer more seafood items, but lunch was a bit high for me. 

They're open 7 days a week. 
Daily, 11 am to 9:30 pm."}
{"text":"This place is ok but not great for the price. I like the Mongolian but would like to pick out my own sauce though. The sushi is ok. I haven't had a roll there that has a good flavor. I like the different dishes on the buffet. I wish I could have tried some crab legs but its like Black Friday there. People are standing around and then they take them all. It is so rude. Then it takes forever to get another order out. They should bring orders to the tables so people don't go crazy and take them all. 
What really got me though was the dessert table. It was all Costco dessert. They didn't even take the cakes off the cheap plastic trays to make them look homemade. It just looked like a potluck where the families swung by the grocery store and picked out a cheap cake. For 15 dollars at least try to fool me. 
I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would say this buffet place is not bad at all. They have varieties kind of food from sushi, Mongolian grill to ice cream and more.

You really get your money worth it here especially the weekend one is good. 

On Saturday they bring out the snow crab legs at 4 and you better be right there in the line because people/customers often grabs as much as they can and don't care about other people behind them. 

That's annoying right? Don't worry there are plenty other seafood that you can eat like shrimps, squid, crawfish, fish and blue crabs."}
{"text":"I came for the crab legs and nothing else. Food here is pretty freaking sad. Being Asian, I do eat quite a few weird things. But frog legs...seriously...? Waitress came by and filled my sprite cup with water and a damp FRUIT FLY. This place is a joke... I can't even...omg....This place sucks."}
{"text":"Lunch time is cheap however the food was all super stale... bit into my corn which felt like hard plastic and as the rest of the food it tasted just as old.... service was all right definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"If you like sea food, this is a good place to satisfy your appetite and even add new flavors to your list like frog legs. We had the fortune to have an awesome waitress and enjoyed our meal.

The place looks clean, and you have many different choices to keep trying next time.!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled this place has very little seafood it's a Chinese buffet. The crab legs that they offer you have to fight for and they taste old or have been boiled too long. I brought my kids here for a special dinner and was severely disappointed in the quality for the price. Never again."}
{"text":"The selection and quality of the food was amazing.  The food was fresh, hot and tasty.  The restaurant is clean and well maintained.  The staff is plentiful and attentive. Some of the offerings were labeled only in Chinese which is not good for someone with dietary restrictions.  

The price is excellent but we are all seniors.

Our biggest issue is that only one bill was issued for 5 guests paying with cards and with coupons.  Checking out was a disaster.  Why not charge guests on the way in."}
{"text":"Pros:
Wide variety of options
Certain things are fresh, usually the meats are cooked properly
Offers sushi
Offers hibachi (where you make a plate and they cook it for you)
So far, good service from the wait staff

Cons:
Not in Tempe
Dirty most of the time, especially the bathrooms
The seafood is not fresh or abundant half of the time. The sushi is a hit or miss depending on time or day
Overall, quality does not justify the price but we come here out of habit and lack of options."}
{"text":"Anytime I want to go to a Chinese buffet, I go to Pacific. The sushi is good as far as buffet sushi goes. It's not as good as you would get at an actual sushi restaurant, but it's pretty decent. They have a good variety of food. My absolute favorite thing there is the short ribs. They are delicious! They have a good variety of ice cream as well! All in all, a pretty good Chinese buffet!"}
{"text":"Now I know a one star rating is harsh, and I'm sure this place has seen its good days and I am sure that I will offend and anger many people with my review but hey this is Yelp! 

OK I'm sure this place in it's glory days was a great buffet, especially for the area that it is in and the old run down building it stands in. Those days my friends are far gone, or from at least what I saw and tasted today. 

The place was not busy at all and there should not have been any reason for it to have been this messy. There were tables that were dirty and uncleaned for the majority of the time I was there. There was no place settings or silverware on any tables nor were there any at the buffet. I felt as if I were Indian Jones searching out my fork to eat. I had to fight my way through an army of random chairs that have lost their way from their tables and jump over the food that was dropped on the floor. 

As I explored the buffet, I saw numerous empty dishes, a invisible buffet or a special one for those of us who are watching our weight. The sea of low quality seafood smothered in batter and fried or swimming in butter and drying out in the lamps. It was with this a great reminder of how horrible buffets can be. Even when the empty dishes were filled and another go around was done still nothing great to report back to the mother ship. 

The hype from all the people who talk about this place makes it so much more worst since we are expecting so much more. A huge let down and sad ending to what was once a great buffet or from what I been told. Think this ship has sailed and there is no need to look back."}
{"text":"Very good good...as far as buffet style goes. Tried just about everything. Dessert is a little off and many are frozen...however the rest of the food was fresh. Service was slow and the bathrooms need a bit of attention...but it is a Friday night. This will not put me off from coming here again."}
{"text":"Most of the time I'm a little hesitant having sushi at a buffet.  Much less a Chinese buffet lol.  I had some sushi here anyway and everything seemed fine.  No one got sick so that's always a bonus.  And they have a big sushi section. 

They also have a lot of crab legs but I didn't get any of that.  I got a lot of their dim sum/dumplings, chicken, and a few other things.

I liked that they had some ube rolls.  I'm not sure what it's called but it's a purple bun.  That was yummy.  

I would come back!"}
{"text":"I am a returning customer over and over.Great place to bring your friends like I am going to do today."}
{"text":"This buffet is terrible.  I can't believe the reviews of this place.  The food tastes awful, the sushi was hard as a rock, and nothing appeared \"fresh.\"  Everything fishy was just terrible. I nearly gagged when they brought food out in those grey dish tubs to the metal \"bins.\"  It's like--really?  You can't class it up a bit?  For the price this place charges, they should be serving food on solid gold platters being carried by butlers in tuxedos!  I ended up resorting to eating fruit, as it seemed safe, and filled me up just the same.  Oh, and one last touch to this place: there is nothing quite like a buffet that has its employees announcing over a loud speaker to the kitchen staff what they need more of."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on friday with 11 other friends and had a great time. It wasnt too busy and we went at around 1230pm. The place is clean and has a goos amount of seating. It has a variety of foods from chinese to sushi to bbq everything and self serve ice cream and desserts. They also had dim sum and a variety of soups. Overall good food at a decent price!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat because of the sashimi, it's expensive so being able to get it all you can eat is great between that and the seaweed salad it's worth it. Not unless you need to use the bathroom then you might vomit all your food. It's old run down smells paint chipping"}
{"text":"This place is certainly interesting to say the least. I came here with my husband and 7 year old son who is an adventurous eater. We were greeted with that awful fishy seafood smell when we walked in. I honestly expected it, but it's still not appetizing. We were seated fairly quickly and we went and checked everything out. 

They have all you can eat sushi, American asian mainstays like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, lo mien, and fried rice. They have an assortment of seafood like steamed cod, baked salmon, fried and grilled shrimp, and crab. They have soups like hot and sour, egg drop, miso, and clam chowder. Then they have the interesting stuff like chicken feet, grilled octopus, whole fried fish, snails (in the shell) seafood dough, and more. For dessert they have an assortment of cakes and cookies along with an ice cream cooler. They definitely had a wide variety of foods and my son absolutely loved trying out the various dishes. 

So why the three stars? To be fair, Id bump it up to 3.5 if I could. First, I really didn't like how the sushi and seafood was served. The sushi was kept at room temperature and the seafood out on the buffet line didn't seem warm enough to me. It made me nervous enough that I had a hard time enjoying it because I felt like I was going to get sick. It didn't seem like there were enough people eating it to go through it fast enough to make it a non issue. Next, the food was so so. For the price I suppose that's to be expected, but I'd rather have less variety and better quality served. The desserts were terrible, except for the ice cream. However, the ice cream serving situation seriously skeeved me out. It had one scooper sitting in water and you are supposed to serve yourself. That means a ton of people grabbing this scooper and leaning over the ice cream to scoop it up. I imagine this leads to all sorts of stuff falling into the ice cream buckets throughout the day. 

Anyway, if you have an adventurous eater I would recommend bringing them here. My son had a great time! It ended up being about $55 for all three of us. I don't think I'll ever come back, but I can see how someone else might enjoy it."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I was a bit skeptical, but the food was delicious, fresh and hot.  The crab legs were great, unfortunately, they never had enough out and people where waiting by the crab dish like they were starving.  They have a great selection of food."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the Phoenix area, I usually try to eat at Pacific Seafood Buffet at least once, but it's always at the location on Bell Rd, and this time I decided to try the Chandler store. 

The experience was not as good as usual. Part of the problem was likely that we came in at around 8pm, but we still paid the same price as if we came in at 6pm or whenever. 

My first problem was that they were out of rice and didn't cook any more. They had at least one cook who was ignoring people leave stuff to be grilled for a very, very long time. One of my kids said that a server told him they were cleaning in the back. Regardless of cleaning, which I understand, you have paying customers.

The kids were loving it a lot, until they ran into some less-than-appealing stuff. 

The ice cream was great. The desserts were pretty poor, with all of the cakes dried out and fairly bland. The carrot cake was awful. 

What little rice was left was excellent, and I liked the salmon. Everyone ate a pretty decent amount of food. 

Generally, the service was OK, but as the time was approaching 9pm, they just all seemed like they wanted to leave, with the rice steamer being left completely empty and they were still open for another 30 minutes.

The other store is definitely better.

I would give 2 stars, but they still have all-you-can-eat salmon and a large assortment of ice cream flavors, so 3 stars."}
{"text":"For the price, this is my favorite seafood buffet. Since I am biased toward salmon and coconut shrimp, and I tend to fill up on these, this place is best for me.

They have a decent variety for those with broader palates than mine, including a sushi bar, stuff freshly cooked by wok, small salad bar, and a selection of desert options including ice cream."}
{"text":"Normally I try to stay away from anywhere that has the words \"seafood\" and \"buffet\" in the same sentence.

However, when we walked in my head fucking exploded.

Sushi?  Yes.
Crazy amounts of different seafood?  Yes.
Rice?  Of course.
Other food items for the seafood squeamish?  Yes.
DESSERT TABLE?  Yes.
Sweet staff?  Yes.

I don't understand how the pacific northwest doesn't have a place like this anywhere b/c it is definitely needed!  

The food is fresh, quick, and delicious and the place itself is bustling and chock full of all kinds, all enjoying a fantastic buffet of goodness!

Do yourself a favour and stop by this gem to get your buffet on.  I'll see you in line, suckers!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but we went here specifically for the crab legs and they couldn't keep up with the demand. They would bring out one pan of legs every 15 minutes and people would stand there and wait and take them all in one trip."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, I personally was not a fan. And the buffet area is a tight space, the aisles are way too tight, I felt uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Got great service, the food was excellent.  My mom got lots of crab.  The food was good.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"07/08/10

2.5 stars.  Why not round up to 3?  'Cause I wouldn't go back for dinner.  You might be able to pay me to try their lunch buffet here, but what items I I had for dinner tonight didn't wow me enough to want to return.  Indeed, the course I liked best was dessert!  And I'm at the point in my life now that if I'm going to splurge on anything, then it must be high-quality.

Our \"feast\" included crablegs (too skinny and cold); frog legs (too greasy and soggy); gyoza/pan-fried pork dumplings (wrapper was perfect in its thin-ness, but flavor-wise, not memorable); eggrolls (took one bite, thought it stale and greasy in flavor, and moved on); sashimi (most pieces were either too tough or still-frozen!); sesame-crusted ahi-tuna (overpowering fishy taste!); crab-stuffed, then baked oysters (delightful in its glorious saturated-fat goodness, and my fave out of the mains!); and clams (too gritty).  Most of the desserts were good, and my faves were the green tea ice cream and mung bean buns, especially those that were sesame-encrusted!  

If the seafood could've been just a little bit fresher and a little less fishy, and the fried items a little less greasy, then maybe dinner wouldn't have been so disappointing.  With so many dining options out there, I see no reason to return.

Well, maybe for a scoop of green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"The shumai and bbq ribs! And beef and broccoli! Even some of the sushi was decent. And they had real ice cream! Teriyaki chicken! And chicken wings! And chicken on a stick! And potstickers with the perfect sauce! This is where I'll come from now on when I want to eat greasy Chinese until my stomach hurts."}
{"text":"Been to pacific a few times and have good experiences here. Nothing too fancy but very clean and tasty food for a buffet. I've come for lunch and dinner several times. The last time I came was for lunch and was a very good deal, 20% off from 2-4, and had a great lunch! Bonus that there is a sushi chef that will take orders if you ask Nicely and a Mongolian grill too. Sushi wasn't bad, but they do use cheap Imitation crab meat, but the fish on it is actually good. I always order Rainbow and caterpillar roll both are tasty. Not 5 star on sushi but I'm thinking a solid 3. I've had better and I've had worse. But great for a seafood buffet!!

Anyways from what I remember for dinner they have snow crab legs and a bit more fish. I had such a good lunch I will probably be back for lunch only for now on."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, clean, big, open, clean modern steam tables.  Very disappointing food. Seafood is delicate and must be prepared properly. These people have never seen seafood before.  All of it was over cooked and cold ( not iced).   Calimari was like large rubber bands.  Snails were large blobs  of rubber. Totally inedible. All different shrimp were tough also tasteless.  Didn't bother trying everything. No one could possibly ever return to this joke ,  hardly could be called a seafood restaurant. Not sure I'll ever eat seafood again."}
{"text":"Horrible service and unhygienic. Server named Moon doesn't tell customers that the tip had already been included and they end up double tipping. Sushi isn't even that good, food is cold and dry most of the time. They took frog legs off the menu. Cockroaches running around and they are a bit racist. Extremely disappointed, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious! Nothing to say but a satisfied full belly. I like how they leave a full pitcher with the same drink you ordered so that way you don't have to wait and ask for more to drink. Delicious seafood! Totally worth the price."}
{"text":"Greeting at the door was great. Good food but the waitress was rude rude rude. Won't be returning here"}
{"text":"Used to be one of the best seafood / Chinese buffets around.  Has really gone down hill in the past couple months.   Several items were cold.   Crab puffs were only wrapper and frying grease was trapped inside.   Frog legs were really good and sushi selection was nice.   Weekday price of $16.88 was high.  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Although pricey, I think that this is by far the best Chinese buffet in the area. All the other ones are either nasty or super ghetto.  It's much better than it's sister restaurant that just opened up in Chandler.  They usually restock \"all the good stuff\" like sushi (and it's actually good!), crayfish, and crab pretty consistently.  They also have a Mongolian grill."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with mediocre experiences. The last visit was disappointing. My friend had a sudden urge to use the restroom where she vomited and had massive diarrhea. When we checked out and were asked how everything was, she kindly told them that something she ate quickly upset her stomach that led her to need the bathroom. The cashier said, \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" We had to quickly leave before another episode would happen. I was very disappointed in the response we were given and unable to get ahold of a manager when I called to follow up."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday to try their lunch buffet. Was not disappointed with the variety and quality of food. You can definitely give it a try on a weekday as on weekends it becomes too pricey."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is disgusting and there was a hair in my friend's food. When we informed the manager that there was hair in the food, she picked up the plate, put her own hand on the plate, and then proceeded to tell us that it was not a hair but it was instead a scratch on the plate. However, I am not aware of scratches on the plate that move when you touch them. She then tried to give back the plate to us with the hair on it but we told her that we did not want it. We ended up paying $40+ for the cold, burnt, and/or nasty food with hair on it and they were not even apologetic. We will definitely NOT be returning here and do not recommend it at all!"}
{"text":"Much better experience this time now that I know which foods I should stay clear of.  They had a lot of fresh fish out in the hot buffet lines such as sole and flounder, and our server was very attentive and friendly.  Good selection of seafood in general, and while some of the sashimi still isn't totally thawed out, I suppose if you wait long enough for it to thaw on your plate it will taste OK."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.. Great price for all you can eat crab! Unfortunately, families were swiping plates of it as soon as it came out. They were kind enough to leave a few scrawny, soggy legs for those of us who are not greedy vultures and trying to enjoy our meals. It pains me to say this, but out of an entire buffet, I mostly enjoyed the sticky buns (sweet rolls similar to donuts). I tried a little of almost everything too. Okay... And the bathrooms? Disgusting. I am glad I didn't go in there before I ate. Their saving grace was that the server was nice and seemed to know the regulars. She did take a long time to get our drinks and never explained anything to us newbies to their buffet. BUT she was nice lol. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pacific Sea Food Buffet is hands down the best buffet in the Phoenix area.  If you like Chinese food and you like seafood then there is no need to read any further.  Just get in your car and drive over to experience the deliciousness for yourself.  

They have the biggest crab legs, and you usually have to wait in line to get them.  I was impatient while waiting for more crab legs, i tried the craw-fish.  I discovered I liked them even more than the crab legs.  they are well seasoned and full of flavor.  To eat them simply break them in half then suck the head & pinch the tail.

Pacific Sea Food's sushi is very good too.  While its not as good as a high end sushi restaurant, they have a very good selection and for a buffet it is fantastic.  They have a lot of seafood to choose from: baked salmon, grilled mackerel, steamed fish, szechuan fish, salt and peppered shrimp on a stick, fresh shucked oysters, steamed clams, fish balls.  They also do the Mongolian barbecue and have Korean barbecue too.  Be sure to try the grilled asparagus, frog legs, roasted duck and snails.  (the snails are huge)

I can't think of any complaints about Pacific Sea Food buffet other than I wish it was closer to my house :)"}
{"text":"There are so many Chinese Buffet restaurants in town, they all come and go, keep changing owners, etc. This place is the only Chinese buffet restaurant that got better and better over time. 

They do have large selections of tasty food and not boring like other Chinese buffet restaurants. Overall quality is good and they do keep it up.

Do stay away from the raw oysters, just too risky. They don't have the best sushi but fairly decent as far as buffet place goes.

Prices have gone up and its not cheap.

Overall, I do vote this place \"Best of Chinese Buffet Restaurant\" in town."}
{"text":"Went here reluctantly because my mom likes this place. I'm always wary of hunters because the volume of food reduces my appetite. There is a good variety of seafood, meats, carbs, vegetables, and dessert. Edible, but not great quality. 

3 stars because it's expected of a buffet and because the green tea ice cream and egg tarts are good."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but majority of it was cold. Cold food at a buffet is a little concerning with meeting food safety standards."}
{"text":"We had driven by Pacific Seafood Buffet several times in the past but this was our first stop.  After reading the good reviews, I thought the choice would be perfect.  Well, kind of perfect considering my husband doesn't eat much seafood.  Reviews I had read indicated there was a Mongolian BBQ which is usually something that he is interested in.  

There was a good selection of food and the food was fresh and well prepared.  We were there at lunch and the senior price was just under $11.00.  The price did not include drinks.  I'm not sure what the difference if food selection is between the lunch items and the dinner items but dinner is about $5 more.

We weren't so impressed with the cashier/hostess or our server.  When walking in the cashier/hostess was fiddling with her phone.  Then, she walked over to us and stood wiping her eyes out before she spoke.  Our server was definitely not efficient.  Most of her time was standing and conversing with the bartender either leaning over the bar or with her arms folded behind it.  Our dirty plates piled as did others.  Obviously, our tip reflected it and so did the rating.  Otherwise, this would have been a strong 4-star choice.

However, I would like to return sometime and checkout the dinner offerings."}
{"text":"This is a great place overall.  Everything that I've gotten here has been amazing and awesome quality.   Relative to other buffets, dinner is a little higher than most, but not by much, and it's worth every penny.  You pay for quality so, splurge!!"}
{"text":"I usually always take a pic but this time I didn't because I was too busy stuffing my face. Haven't been here in about 2 years and it was good then but I don't  remember it being this good. We went about noon on a Saturday, it wasn't really that busy. The staff was nice as well as the restaurant. I tried sushi, frog legs, oysters, mussels, clams, octopus... well let's just say I tried a lot of a variety of things and everything was great. I will definitely be back soon and I'll take pics next time."}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in the area! The sushi is perfect and lots of variety and there is so much authentic Asian dishes that only real Asian kids who grew up with first generation immigrants can appreciate!

They are always busy but are worth it! I'm a sushi slut so I can't say enough good things about it! Don't be a jerk and please tip those busy sushi chefs! They are making edible art people!"}
{"text":"Went for the crab leg special. Had no idea it was $17.99 a person!!!'

Wow things have really gone up here. The quality of food from the side items to the fried items all were horrible. I have never seen grapes with seeds in them and watermelon that tastes like rhine.

The bathrooms were not too bad, expect for the light switch that hasn't been wiped down in 5 years! I could only imagine that back kitchens sanitary practices are like???


We were served by an American gal, she was point on with drinks dirty plates and crab crackers . If no stars existed I would give this place that, but because our service was good one star remains."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese seafood buffets that I have been to! The sushi  is fresh and made in bite size rolls. They have made to order service as well as delicious buffet selections. The restaurant and restrooms are always clean and the staff is friendly and quick. Our family loves the experience here. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised! A lot of food options, everything was fresh and clean, the service was pretty good and the area was very big! The crab legs were really good and I love that they have different types of Chinese food. I thought the ice cream would just be average, but it turned out to be really good!"}
{"text":"crab legs were very good and service was friendly and the buffet was always stocked full of good things"}
{"text":"First off, pricing as of February 16th, 2015:
Weekday lunches: $9.88 + tax
Weekday dinners: $16.88 + tax
Weekends (all day): $17.88 + tax

Okay so I kinda ditched this place for a while cause I didn't think their dinner buffets were all that great for what you're paying but since it's President's Day and I get a Monday off, I decided to check out their weekday lunch buffet.

Honestly, I don't know if everything seemed better cause of our really nice waitress Lisa, or if it was the significantly cheaper ($8 cheaper to be precise) price tag, but I finally see why people rave about this buffet.  With the exception of not having any crab legs, you get the same variety and choices at the weekday lunch available to you on the weekends.

There are about 40-50 dishes available, the food was fresh, and you can get your usual fix of orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, broccoli beef (admittedly with way more broccoli than beef), some seafood, some Korean barbecue meats, and even some dim sum.  I honestly think the quality of the dim sum has improved cause the little custard buns definitely had more custard that I remembered, and the barbecue pork buns (char siew buns) definitely had a lot more meat than on my last visit a few months back.  They also have a sushi bar where the sushi is freshly prepared in front of you, but if it's sushi you want, do yourself a favor and get all-you-can-eat sushi at Mido Sushi cause the sushi at Pacific doesn't quite cut it.

Now on to desserts.  Not impressed.  I realize all Chinese buffets have similar desserts but the cakes just don't do it for me.  They don't look great and taste like a heap of sugar.  That said, go for the ice cream right next to the dessert table.  They generally have about 8 flavors to choose from, two of which are some sort of sorbet, a chocolate, a strawberry, a vanilla, a mint chocolate chip, a cookies and cream, and a green tea.  Green tea was the obvious favorite with there being barely anything left when I hit the ice cream bar at about 1PM today.

In a nutshell: Lunch is great, at $9.88 (it rhymes!).  The crab legs aren't worth the extra $8 and that's only available at dinner.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten here. The food is good, but what makes this a fun place to eat is the variety of dishes available. I wanted to introduce my daughter to new dishes that aren't normally seen in American restaurants. They had snails, frog legs, crawfish, octopus, chicken feet, numerous fish and sushi dishes as well as all of your regular Asian dishes. As always the hospitality was great and the experience is one that my daughter says she will remember for a lifetime. (For the better) she really enjoyed the dishes and the experience."}
{"text":"So far, I tried many chinese buffet and I always going back to this place. The seafood always better than other restaurant, the taste always great! The sushi always great everytime I went back there! The oyster..awsome!!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"There was a time in my life when I would not dare step food in a buffet. Buffets were not places I would spend my money. Well, life has a way of making you change your ways and for me, making me change the places I can afford to eat at. This buffet isn't specifically a cheap buffet, but it is a good deal for the selections offered. They have a wide array of choices. I wasn't too fond of their nigiri sushi but it was comparable to some sushi joints out there and I am not even talking of the AYCE restaurants. The roll selection was decent, they had spicy tuna roll, and I was surprised by how good it was. They have a BBQ section that I didn't get to try but looked really delicious! Also they had a lot of dim sum selections which I had not seen at a buffet before, they also had your typical chinese buffet standards. I liked the fact that like their name states, they are indeed a seafood buffet! Lots of different fish options! I would invite you to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat buffet so you would expect a lower quality. The oysters here were so terrible. They do have a lot of options, but I came for the crab legs and oysters. I think if I actually swallowed the oyster, I'd be sick; it wasted fresh. The crab legs was lower quality and even had weird black dots on them?? They would refill them every hour so it was not enough for others waiting for crab legs. If you come to eat the other items then maybe it's okay, but not sure it's worth $18.88."}
{"text":"Had a good time coming here on Saturday got there as soon as it opened 11 a.m. I was looking forward to trying the snails, frog legs and their sashimi everything nice and fresh I really enjoyed the fresh ginger  I'll be visiting again so"}
{"text":"It's been over 2 years since my last review of Pacific Seafood Buffet. I've been eating here regularly since 2006, and I've yet to have a bad experience, get sick, or.. find a consistently better Asian Buffet. That's huge, as I've visited what feels like.. ALL THE BUFFETS in the East Valley. The sushi is always fresh, super tasty, and totally scarfable. The hot dishes are really good too.. everything is a notch above what most other buffets sling. They serve up an amazing Szechuan Fish.. I kinda ate 1/2 a pan of it the last time I was there... or maybe more than 1/2 a pan, and I'm actually quite proud of myself! 
Top it off with a fun selection of decent desserts (especially the Strawberry Whipped Cream cake, and those fun little square Mocha cakes) and you've got a buffet I'm eager to hit at any time!"}
{"text":"A lot of good selections

Was able to get in n out without much wait

Quality foods...

Had frog legs, sushi,

Loved the egg tart custards and the coconut mango rice too!!

Yum"}
{"text":"Decent food The desert area is not as good as other buffets I've tried this stir fri area is not as clean as it supposed to be
The service is good and quick everybody's nice.
I would expect this place to be tiny bit cleaner I mean the floors also it has tiny bit more dust that I would expect."}
{"text":"Truely awful!  Think Golden Corral with seafood!  I was imagining a beautiful seafood buffet and boy was I disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pacific has been our go-to buffet since 2006. This location consistently delivers good food and good service...especially if Lisa is your server. Id give it 5 stars but it is a buffet and the quality decreases a bit between 3-4pm when they are switching from lunch to dinner.
The sushi is great.I like the variety of deep fried to specialty to hand rolls to nigiri. Always of good quality.
The mongolian grill is a nice addition although I'm usually too busy eating sushi to take advantage of it.
Salad bar options are a little weak, but you shouldn't go to an Asian/seafood buffet for salad.
Lots of dishes with varying types of protein including tofu for vegetarians.
Great to finiah off your meal with one of their many cakes or a scoop of ice cream (they have like 10 flavors!)
Go get yourself some Pacific!!"}
{"text":"When the store bought lemon cake is the highlight of your meal you know you just pissed away 20 bucks.

Never again."}
{"text":"Ugh...I'm usually not one to give a bad review but the food was less than stellar. The sushi was chewy and disappointing. The best item on the menu was the diet Pepsi. The bbq pork was harder to chew than beef jerky."}
{"text":"As with ALL buffets, they start out good, then slip into meh, or worse.   The first time we tried this place it was nice.  (Buffets are never great, its the nature of doing cafeteria style food)
The selections this time were just as vast as the first time we tried them, but alas, the quality is so hit-n-miss that I must pass on this place in the future.  Not only was the food ranging the scale from good to gross across the various dishes, it was also doing so on the same dish.  My first trip through the line I got pot stickers and some really nice sole, after several minutes I returned to finish off with the stuff I knew was good and in just that time, the food quality dropped to... yuck!
At $20 a plate, I don't expect it to be Roy's Hawaiian Fusion, (Check that out sometime) but I do expect to be able to get through a meal without wanting to vomit.  (Yes, some things just about got me to that point.)
Look, I love to experiment with food, nothing scares me, but I do require that if you are going to present me with something new and unusual, you prepare it in the proper way to highlight the ingredient.  Epic fail on many of the dishes here.  Oh and I forgot to mention the sushi that was made from fish so old that it should not have been used for any kind of dish.  I have had pre-packaged stuff from the grocery store that was not as fishy tasting. 
All in all, I'll spend another $20 a plate and get something awesome."}
{"text":"Visited 4/21/2018
This place is a solid 3 1/2 to 4 Star Place.  Staff was very friendly and even on a Saturday night they got us in and seated rather quickly.
When you come station seafood they had a great selection of different things for different tastes.  Everything from sushi to crab legs was quite tasty.  I waitressed camper glasses full and our empty plates taken away.
All in all it was a pleasant dinner.  I will try it again next time I'm out this way.   One downfall there a little stingy with the crab legs by only bringing out a small amount about every half hour.  I was disappointed they didn't have the frog legs I've seen so many photos.  Perhaps next time.  Still worth another try.
See you next time."}
{"text":"Decent buffet I think it was $10 at lunch when we went.  They had a decent selection of hot foot and sushi type rolls. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't go to Asian food buffets often, but I'd have to say this is definitely one of my new favorites. The inside is very large and was clean when I came at opening. All dishes were set out with the exception of the desserts and fresh fruits. No problem as I don't eat those till last. 

This place isn't lacking for variety. They have so many different dishes, that even the pickiest person would be able to find at least 1 item that they would enjoy. On the norm, I wouldn't try anything new, but when I come to Asian buffets so many items look too delicious not to try. I always enjoy the noodle dishes, chicken dishes, egg drop soup, potstickers, tofu and other dishes. The food was fresh and hot. Also, the dishes I tried were well flavored and well cooked. Price at lunch for All-You-Can-Eat is about $10 a person and this doesn't include a drink. 

The staff here are not particularly friendly, but they aren't rude either. Maybe they can't speak clear English so they just don't make conversations with their customers. My waitress only asked what I wanted to drink and if everything was good. Other then that, she didn't speak to me."}
{"text":"???????, ??????!

Went to eat there with dear friends, pretty good! The place was not busy and service was good too."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. It is really a seafood lover's paradise! I have filled up on the crab legs, mussels, shrimp, various fish, sushi..just YUM! The wait staff is super nice! They have a lot of different items to choose from. I was super excited to try all the different kinds of dishes. I even tried escargot. Which I can say I had the opportunity to try it. Not a fan, but I ate it! People load up on the crab legs, crawfish, and escargot so be prepared to bump elbows with some patrons! They don't mess around! Haha. The dinner price is to be expected. It's around $17. And for all-you-can-eat seafood, I think that's a bargain! The atmosphere is pleasant. They have one of the better dessert bars I've seen and I do appreciate the hand-dipped flavors of ice cream. I am a big fan of this place and I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have visited here several times. We've never had a bad experience! They have a great selection, even for land lovers. The sushi is probably one of the best I've ever had at a Chinese buffet. 
It's also nice that they have crab legs included in the price, some buffets I've went to charge extra! 
Keep up the good work Pacific!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 3:00pm Saturday afternoon.  Thought I'd get the lunch special price with my kids.  Bad service, gross sushi, no refills, servers were more interested in helping the big birthday party than helping us, and hard chicken.  I literally had to spit out some food.   Waited 17 minutes to get my check.  Went to the front and got an attitude because I didn't have my check.  $103.00 for 2 adults and 3 kids w/ water!  Told the hostess maybe they should post their prices because the restaurant sure doesn't look like it would be pricey.  And if I'm gonna pay $103 for sushi it better be good."}
{"text":"Ok. Let's just say....   YUCK!!!   This place is one of the worst buffets in town and charges more than most.  The food is cold and dried out.  Panda Express has 5 star food compared to here and that is a bad thing given I'm not a fan of PE either.   Never will be back for this crappy food and too high of prices.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!   I see no redeeming quality for this place."}
{"text":"Not bad for the selection and price. They have everything you could think of and even raw food that you pick and they bbq it up for you. They kept the crab legs fully stocked the night I went. If you can't find something you like here you aren't trying hard enough. It's a huge buffet!"}
{"text":"Typical chinese buffet their attempt at serving a lot of seafood for your money's worth  falls short because there are heeps of people lined up like there was a blow out sale for the crab legs.  Once you do get the crab legs they are over salted so you won't want to eat more.  The sushi was super fishy and other entrees dry as they are left out on the heating pad.  The one yummy thing is the mongolian bbq & fried chinese donuts.. but $20 for that? No thanks."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan of this place. The food wasn't horrible or disgusting. The food tasted good. But the drink service was meager at best, the selection wasn't overly fantastic. 

I think I have been spoiled at the Vegas buffets. Certainly give this place a spin if you are in the area but don't make a trip specifically for it."}
{"text":"First, let me begin by saying that I am not a big fan of buffets, which means I have no high expectations. However, this place wasn't that bad compared to other buffets I had. The food is either a hit or a miss, there is usually no in between. The reason I didn't mind this place though is because of the snow crab legs. As you know, snow crab legs by the pound can add up, so having essentially an all you can eat is worth the entree of the buffet alone. If they seasoned it correctly, you can go for eighths, but if they don't season it correctly, it taste very bland and overcooked. The fish is usually disgusting as it has a weird aftertaste. I try to avoid the fish when I am there. The sushi area did not seem clean or fresh at all even though they typically have a sushi chef there. Perhaps it is the presentation. I also dislike how they keep the wasabi in a large jar which is open to the public without any screen guard. They have a variety of different food options, but it's hard to describe each one. The ice cream was probably the best part aside from the snow crab legs."}
{"text":"My husband, 2 kids, mother-in-law, and I went here because my mother-in-law wanted crab legs. We went on a Tuesday night around 7 and we were all very disappointed. The food was the worst buffet food I have had. I tried the Mongolian BBQ where you get to choose your own mix. The vegetables were brown and wilted. The beef was empty so I asked if they had more, about a minute later, they brought out frozen chopped beef pieces which were smaller than a finger nail. After it was cooked, it did not taste good. The sweet and sour pork was cold, old, and dry and my husband said his sushi was not good either. The crab legs that we went for were cold and bad quality. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The choice of food was good even though chickens feet and pickled pigs feet aren't really my cup of tea. 
Everything was good and fresh. 
My only issue was that I've ate at other restaurants just as good and the prices were much more reasonable than this place. It was almost a 100$ for our family of 4.
I'm assuming the location has something to do with the prices."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, it's a buffet and there's a lot of seafood. If neither of these sound like you then DUH; go somewhere else. 
They've got a great sushi area as well as plenty of typical Asian dishes such as orange chicken and noodles. 
I went because of the main event- crab legs!!! People who don't like crab legs can get a plate of crab legs and then give that plate to me!
The atmosphere was clean and very typical of a buffet. We were a party of 5 and waited maybe 10 minutes on a Saturday night. My two young kids found enough to eat and my wife and mother-in-law had their fills as well. 
I'll certainly be visiting again."}
{"text":"It's good food. But I feel they use MSG in their food to fill us Americans up faster and it costs a little over $20.00 an adult if you go during dinner time which is after 4pm. To me, I feel for the cost it is a bit steep for altered unorganic food. In a sense you are better off going to Olive Garden if you are trying to save a buck and feed a big family . But if you have extra cash to throw around then this is a good buffet compared to most dirty, unsanitary buffets I have observed and unfortunately ate at."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to learn that there was a Pacific Seafood much closer to me than the one I had gone to two times at the Chandler location.  I was quite impressed when I
frequented the Pacific Seafood buffet at THAT location.  The variety of items offered was ENORMOUS!!  I would rank the Pacific Seafood buffet well above your average Asian buffet.  My only complaint that the food on the steam tables, for the most part, was just lukewarm.  A comment to our waiter elicited a prompt response from the restaurant manager.  She stated that the steam tables were kept at the required (by Maricopa county) temperature and that the circulating air in the restaurant cooled the food down AFTER it was placed upon our plates.  I told her I only walked about 20 feet with my filled plate - so that didn't seem like a reasonable excuse for the temperature of the food not being hot.  The tempura vegetables probably were the most cool thing I had on my plate.  My companion stated that most all of the food that she had gotten was lukewarm, also.  Food temperature, notwithstanding, I will still go back there again since its only about half the distance for me to drive in comparison with going to the Chandler location and I did enjoy the wide variety of dishes offered."}
{"text":"4 years later still a solid spot for a lunch buffet. 
They raised their prices a bit from the $8.95 I remember to around $10.50 for lunch but it's still an incredible value. Where else can you find a great mix of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese food all under one roof.

Standouts are
- Wokked Mushrooms
- Maki Handrolls
- BBQ Area

I wouldn't come here for the $18 crab leg dinner free for all but it is a go-to spot for lunch~"}
{"text":"Went here and its pretty good upscale chimes buffet with the crab legs scene of course you better be right there for them legs they go fast and they don't fill them fast enough. The cost is decent 20 for meal and drink and servers are pretty good about keeping your drinks filled.. Good variety of items the sushi well is buffet so don't expect too much but a couple rolls where ok..."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night which was also Valentines Day. Our waitress did not speak  English which was fine but I also could not say my drink order without confusion. I got water and a glass of ice when I asked for an Iced Tea.. Whatever it was fine. The selection was great with a ton of choices. The frog legs were a welcome change. Lots of sushi and other goodies. I did try the crab legs and cracked one open and took a bite.. but it tasted like sewage. I chewed and swallowed and then I smelled ammonia. I did not end up sick from this occasion however. Overall nice for the choices."}
{"text":"The array of seafood they offer here for the price is truly impressive. You can sample sushi and sashimi to mussels and crab legs. They always feature salmon and sometimes even have crawfish! There's a whole lot to pick from and usually the price is around $20 per person. It's hard to beat the value you get for your hard-earned seafood-snarfin' dollar here!

A couple of things I noticed in the few times I've done the buffet thing here. If you arrive late, the pickin's will be slimmer. There will be some items that you know have sat in the chafing dish that aren't as palatable-looking as they were when first deployed. You have to act fast when the batches of crab legs are put out, since everyone and their mom seems to belly up for another round of these pronto! I also steer clear of a lot of the sushi past 9 p.m. It always looks a little dried-out and curious to me, not something I'm willing to take too much of a chance on.

However, I feel the dining experience here is pleasant. The staff are friendly and helpful. And there is a ton of good seafood to keep you satisfied. There are even things that I'm a little unsure of how to eat, like sea snails or something I couldn't quite recognize. This place is densely frequented by the East Valley Asian community, which to me says this is the place to find reasonably-priced good seafood. Beware though...the competition is fierce for those fresh batches of crab legs! You may have to use your crab cracker to defend your rightly-deserved, hard-fought-and-won portion!"}
{"text":"Pretty great place for wonderful asian bbq/grilled meats including cha siu, korean short ribs, roasted duck, teriyaki chicken, pork chop.  Typical chinese fare includes beef and broccoli, fried rice, chow mein, sweet and sour pork, pot stickers, sweet and sour fish, steamed crab legs, salt and pepper crab legs, steamed clams, etc.  Japanese fare includes sushi, sashimi, tempura, etc.  Salad bar, ice cream bar (orange sherbert was the best), and dessert bar (yuck) also available.  About $25/person includes tip.

Other important info:  Ample parking, long waits/lines, great array of foods, asian bbq was great, dessert was gross, floors are slick (either wet or greasy, or both)."}
{"text":"Buffets are my personal weakness. Anytime there's a buffet I have to try them out! I've been to this one about 4 times since moving to AZ. I went twice with my gluten sensitive mother (celiac disease) as well. A recent experience prompted me to write this review (actually my first ever!) because the staff here was amazing. 

What had happened was there was this table of 2 adults sending their child up to take HUUUGE plates of crab legs back to the table everytime the staff would put a new platter out, leaving none for anyone else to get. (This table quite literally had 2-3 giant plate fulls of crab legs on their table not even eaten when they sent their kid back for more.) People were obviously peeved including my mother who (since she cannot have gluten) could only eat primarily crab legs (and also shrimp etc). The staff was super nice and this one guy who voiced his upsetment was taken a plate of crab legs by (what looked like) a manager. Our waitress was super nice to my mother and let her know when the next shipment came out to try and beat the child to the crab!

We have never seen this happen any other visit so I don't think it's a regular thing but the staff handled it very nicely. The food is good and always warm. I'm a sushi lover and I have a few pieces everytime I go, NEVER have been sick. One thing to note is that their ice cream is scoopable, not soft serve (gluten sensitive people just an fyi) but it is delicious ice cream for those able to enjoy! I definitely recommend for dinner (haven't been there for lunch yet but maybe soon)!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler. Excellent! Very tasty, above average buffet! Great selection. Would recommend more veggies, however."}
{"text":"Had crab legs on my mind for two days as I couldn't make it here the night before to check it out. Being a bit later than usual (walked in around 830p) a buffet like this may have been the only thing that could properly stave off my hunger. The place was fairly jam packed this Friday night, and a decent portion were of Asian descent (good sign).

  A previous Yelp raised suspicions on whether this place would even deliver on the legs once it got late, and a few people waiting by the empty station had me worried a little at first... until a cook came through those doors wielding a big pot full of bright red steamy shells. Even being of the first pair of people to load my plate I saw how quickly the whole lot can disappear...It was gone within two minutes! I skipped the skimpy little plastic cups and grabbed a soup bowl to fill with buttery business.

  Trip report: 
- 3 plate-loads of crab legs
- Loaded shrimp/scallop stir fry (mixed in with my last batch of crab meat.. yumm)
- Sushi: This is up to your ability to discern old from new - they DO seem to leave rolls sitting there but they are constantly making new ones (to order!)
- Steam bar: Savory sui-mai, pork buns, and some sweet donut-tasting hot pastries, etc..
- Steamed mussels on ice
- Roasted duck - maybe 5-spice seasoning? Tasted good (note: no knives supplied to cut meat from bone!)
- Steamed/grilled sole fillets and (dry) baked salmon

  All in all, its fairly standard Asian buffet fare unless you consider the snow crab to be enough to justify the upcharge from the average $10-12 to $18 per adult. Until I find a better price this will remain my go-to spot for bottomless snow crab.. Though for around this price there are better buffets (See Wandering Horse Buffet in Scottsdale)"}
{"text":"Still solid. They are quick to refill the crab legs. Things are still oily. Sushi quality a bit poorer than I remember."}
{"text":"We wouldn't go back here. I watched one if the employees who was tending to the buffets use a serving spoon to scoop a shrimp that had dropped out onto the counter by someone else back into the serving dish. They do have a large selection, however, the food quality was terrible. The crab legs had a really distinct, odd aftertaste as if they'd been marinating in week old sea water or something- they were gross. My husband's stomach was feeling gross before we even made it home- he stopped eating and just sat there saying his stomach had started rumbling- and the next day I wasn't able to stray far from a restroom at all."}
{"text":"It's a great buffet. If your not sure of what you want for lunch or dinner, this is the place to try out. Sushi, Mongolian grilling, Chinese, it's even got chicken wings.  I love it and will keep going back. Lunch is good at either 11AM or 1PM and dinner is good at 5-6PM if you like to avoid crowds. Haven't been there on a weekend yet."}
{"text":"I've eaten at plenty of Asian seafood buffets in the Bay Area, and they're typically pretty bad in many ways (unsanitary, limited food selection, food isn't fresh, etc.) Considering that the Bay Area probably has a much higher concentration of Asians than Arizona, I wasn't expecting much from Pacific Seafood Buffet, but I was surprised to find that it was actually pretty good (for an Asian buffet).

FOOD: A nice variety of food (lots of sashimi, yay! As well as sushi, meats, stir fry, etc. All the typical Asian buffet foods) even on a super busy and crowded Sunday night. I wouldn't recommend the dim sum, but everything else that I tried was good. Food was replenished quickly. I love the ice cream area! So many flavors - green tea, mango, etc.

PRICE: It's a bit pricey but reasonable, given how much sashimi and crab legs I saw people consuming. Those are expensive!

SERVICE: Not bad. Dirty plates were sometimes cleared a bit slowly, but that's acceptable considering that every table was full of customers.

Overall, a nice surprise! Come hungry."}
{"text":"When I'm traveling alone, Asian buffets work out great because I don't have to sit at a table waiting for service.  I've tried Asian buffets in Las Vegas (Henderson), Los Angeles, Dallas and Denver and the Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler ranks with the best.  Food is plentiful and varied, sushi rolls are good and the place is clean.  Prices are reasonable and alcoholic drinks are available.  It beats fast food by a long shot and is just more comfortable when I'm alone.  It's great for families and was packed with a waiting line on a recent Saturday evening."}
{"text":"If you don't go at the right time. All the food is cold. Any they will tell you its about to be dinner service. And all the workers in the back or on lunch. Bit into a mussel an there was a small crab that almost chipped my tooth. They said it happens all the time. Not in any of my years of going buffets has that happened. They just worried about your money. Not the food or good customer service."}
{"text":"I thought I knew of a great Chinese buffet, but this one blows it out of the water.

I have never eaten anything from here I didn't like. Their seafood selection is something incredible."}
{"text":"This place deserves an ok.  The food I ate was good, but nothing spectacular.  The restaurant had a variety of food and replaced the food as the dishes became empty.  
It is a nice place to eat if you like Asian food and seafood, but do not expect anything extravagant.

I decided to change my review when I was watching the channel 5 news and saw this restaurant featured on Dirty Dining.  I was appalled that the Pacific Seafood Buffet has repeated health code violations.  I can consider some of the violations minor, but some of them are not so minor.  Decide for yourself: http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-17400&business=Pacific%20Seafood%20Buffet&address=8172%20W%20Bell%20Rd&insp_id=3658265"}
{"text":"Halfway through my first plate I almost puked.  It wasn't from the food, it was from the medicine I took for my cold.  I scared the hell out of my friends; they thought I was going to throw up on them and yelled for help LOL Luckily, I know how to control myself.  I went to the restroom, did my business and was back to eating somewhat normally.

Overall, the food was alright.  Price was alright, I guess (~$17), considering they had some good meats and seafood.  My friends devoured the crab legs.  Every time the chef put out a stack, they ran for them, literally.  I liked the sushi they served here, as well as the seafood, but I couldn't eat as much of it because I was still a bit nauseous.

The ice cream looked similar to Thrifty ice cream.  It was good.  I liked the cookies n cream and the strawberry flavor.

If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars..."}
{"text":"I would suggest a visit here to those in the area or traveling through. This place has nice selection and is busy enough to keep the food hot and/or cold on its serving stands. There is a good selection freshly prepared sushi. This place is worth a try. Oh yeah and everyone that works there seemed friendly enough."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices and decent food for an all you can eat buffet. The chow mein and orange chicken are my favorite items. For dessert, you can enjoy the delicious Thirfty ice cream brand."}
{"text":"Don't go there for the crab legs! They are the size of toothpicks. There is a line to get any and they bring out a new pot every 30 min. Sushi is good and egg drop soup. Lot of verity of food just not impressed at all. Pay the extra 10 bucks and go eat at a casino buffet. Thx"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of sushi. Everything else was standard buffet food but the sushi there is the best buffet sushi I've had. I would say it would rival a lot of low quality restaurants.

If I had to, I'd spend all of my money on  the sushi there and nothing else. I don't care about the crab legs or the Mongolian bbq or the other assorted things, the sushi there deserves a lot of respect coming from a buffet."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really call this place a seafood buffet; it's really a Chinese food buffet with a few more seafood offerings... unfortunately, good seafood is not really well suited to sitting on a steam table for an hour or so.  I found the shellfish tough and overcooked as were the crab dishes and crab legs.  It appeared most people come for the crab legs which, upon arrival at the steam table, were set upon and consumed like flies attacking a fresh roadkill.  The sushi bar was OK, but not really exceptional.  I really enjoy good seafood so I was very disappointed that this place did not live up to it's name."}
{"text":"It was very busy and crowed, which honestly kind of was a good sign. They were under staffed so we constantly were stuck waiting in drinks ect. But the food was very good and seemed to be fresh. Had some unique food that I haven't seen before at a buffet but it was really good."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Food was very low quality, all tasted the same.  Service was very very slow.  Don't go there!  Crab legs were so small..prime rib was starting to congeal...everything so over cooked...i have got to say this was one of the worst places i have ever been to....."}
{"text":"I love this buffet. I have been to other Chinese buffets and the food always taste very bland. This place has the most delicious tasting food. I load my plate down with lots of food and even though its all in one pile each dish has its own unique flavor and taste which I have never experienced at any other buffet. I also love coming here for the sushi. Come on all you can eat sushi for 10 bucks during the week where else can you get that. This is the only buffet I will go to now and I have been to lots of buffets in the valley before and this one hands down is the best by far. Also the fact that they have real Good Humor ice cream at the dessert table says that they are all about quality and they wouldn't dare serve nasty soft serve watered down ice milk ewww."}
{"text":"I was super excited yet  apprehensive about this place. After reading mixed reviews some where right on the money and some where maybe at one point true or I guess just the perception of my fellow yelpers either way I wish I would have heed those reviews to go elsewhere. First let me start off by saying that I went with my family on a Sunday (their most popular day because of the crab legs.)  The first thing I noticed was the messed up landscaping not a big deal whatever it's Arizona that won't deter me then the windows of the second doors inside the restaurant and the fish tank both where very filthy and looked very cloudy like they just wiped it with filthy water and no cleaner you can see the stains and will notice them too when you get there. We were seated by what looked like a very fed up waitress felt bad for her because she looked very tired  it was a large group of us and they sat us in this awful booth we were all uncomfortable with our toddler btw she noticed this because we were bickering with each other just walked way. Again whatever poor thing must be tired. I got up went straight to grab a plate and noticed all the dishes had some kind of food and were all soaking wet I must have gone through five of them before choosing one this should have been the final straw for me to tell my family to get up and head for the door. We sat down noticed the silverware had cups had hard food stuck on it as well had to get those changed. I got the famous crab legs mushrooms shrimp green beans and cheese puffs.  Crab legs were tiny low quality had a terrible after taste and smelled old now I had seafood before in other restaurants so I know how it's supposed to taste and smell not saying I'm expert or anything but you can taste fresh and old. The mushrooms and green beans were fine but nothing on the plate was hot the shrimp was just fried no taste wasn't cleaned not hot as well. The dessert chocolate cake was as hard as a rock it tasted like too much baking powder and wasn't sweet at all it was very bitter my son gagged it out.Took my son to the bathroom and the bathroom was filthy For the price of the food and drinks it was not worth it we could have gone to Red Lobster or Carrabas for the same amount and had better quality food that was filing. The last thing that did it for me was on our way out the first door we had opened besides the glass one was a brown metal one that led to the outside was sticky and had what looked like gum and dried food on it too I don't know how that could have got there but I noticed it because were coming out in the sun light and the door swung open to the light. Don't waste your money folks go elsewhere if you're going to spend that kind of money go to an Olive Garden or elsewhere just not here. Hopefully you listen to my warning and if not notice the things I warned you about you'll see."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Pacific Seafood, it was for a midweek lunch buffet. I was in college and had been at the gym with some friends. They asked if I wanted to participate in an impromptu sushi eating contest after lifting.

Well, after eating way more sushi than one should, I had a gander and taste of the rest of the place. Everything is of good quality, reasonably fresh for a buffet, and the grill has some awesome meat.

This is the best Chinese buffets in Phoenix that I've encountered - and it's one of the better ones I've been to anywhere. It's always clean, always has great service, the food is consistently good - if I'm in the mood for an Asian buffet this is the one I go to."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is also a great buffet for the pickier eater, which I am. They have the grill where  you can personalize what you want and they grill it up, lots of hot dishes, and all the food you could dream of! Like hot crab legs, tasty hot soups, and lots of sushi/sashimi.  

It's always fairly to pretty busy during the week and weekend. Staff is nice. I go to the sushi area so much, the guy behind the sushi bar always gives me extra stuff or the fresh sashimi. Great place!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Pacific Buffet. Everytime my friends described Pacific they always enjoyed the seafood. The weekend prices are higher $18.88 weekday is M-F $17.88 for adults but they have crab legs. We really  enjoyed the steamed crab legs that they brought  out pretty frequently. A lot of people here don't really wait on line for their turn at the food and will fight over food with you. But it's  okay it's a buffet. My first experience here was on a Saturday lunch it felt like they didn't refill certain items fast enough.And the sashimi tuna and salmon that day was still frozen. Coming today on a weeknight our servers were MUCH better. (The previous waitresses we had never filled our drinks or came to give our napkins.)Today, I asked if they could refill the french fries and when I turned around the french fries magically appeared.

Come during dinner on weekday here they were really good with service and the food looked more fresh. Overall, experience is like a 3.5. The unlimited free ice cream at the end is an added bonus I like the mint choco chip and matcha."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here once and that was too much!
We went in for dinner the prices were very high for a buffet and drink was not included.
I was disappointed at the selection , lots of fish but not a lot of other meat dishes.
My husband loves sushi and it was OK, the fish he ate was dry.I tried beef & broccoli very simple dish yet had no flavor and the meat texture was like rubber.
The service as OK the waiters seemed like they hated their job and didn't want to be there. For a place that charges almost 20 bucks a person you expect it to be great but what a let down it was.
Overall I would of saved a bunch of money and eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is really a Chinese buffet with a bit more seafood available than the average Chinese buffet. But at $16.88 per person on a Saturday, I think not! 

Too expensive for at most two servings."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite buffet for Seafood (Of course) The past couple years the food hasn't been as fresh. The Crab legs take a long time to get filled after everyone grabs all of them.

The mayo shrimp is another item that is decent to eat. The clam chowder is another item to try that it good. Dinner prices I believe is $15.99 and it's a bit less for lunch. 

I usually try to stay away from buffets since everyone is touching the serving utensils. Just feels like a germ infested place to eat."}
{"text":"Always good. Sushi selection is good and the food is always decent. For a buffet it's easily one of the best in the east valley."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spread of food - crab legs, sushi, sashimi, oysters (on some days), soup, dimsum, build your own stir fry plate, etc. I rate them four star because sometimes they take a long time to refill crab legs and salmon sashimi. Parking is free right outside and if you're an ASU student, you get a discount! Be sure to bring your card though."}
{"text":"We went for my Son's birthday, the service was not the best I never got my table cleaned or my drink refill. For the price I honestly can say I really was not impressed. The food was okay, some of which was cold. The only good feedback I can give is the sushi was good other than that save your money and go somewhere that won't break your pocket book and your taste buds will crave this place was not it."}
{"text":"Soursdey ya'll!

Pacific actually started in Chandler and I'm very to happy that they added another one here on the west side! Never have to wait too long here. Plenty of room and great variety of Asian cuisine. Pretty good sushi bar with tempura veggies, various sushi rolls, and a platter of sushi \"accessories\" such as pineapple salmon salad. The rolls are made fresh in front of ya. They also have a Mongolian grill, also hot and fresh after you assemble what you want. King crab on the weekend is a must. They seriously have a variety of food...from es cargo to frog legs to dim sum items. Along with a variety of desserts, they even have green tea ice cream! Haven't seen green tea cream at any other buffet here in AZ.  Oh, and you scoop your ice cream the \"Thrifty\" way from the tub...which I prefer than the Micky D's way. Anyways, come with a big appetite and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is slightly better quality than most buffet's, but the service isn't great. It's also quite expensive. There is a large selection of food."}
{"text":"The reviews for the restaurant, for the most part, are spot on. I could not believe how great everything was, the best crab legs I have had in a buffet (and we frequent Vegas more often than not!). Everything was excellent, only a few little complaints. Practically everything is un-marked, so you have to guess what it is, and since this is a seafood buffet, a little help would be appreciated. Also, they do not have California Rolls in their seafood selection, at least not the day I was there. I know I know, California Rolls are as generic as \"sushi\" can get, but I love them. Also, no Siracha (don't judge me!) Other than those few things, we will probably return on every trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"All I can say about this place is \"Disappointing\".  It is very low quality food with a very limited selection of seafood.   We came on a Friday night and paid $16 a person.  There are much better Chinese buffets in East Mesa that offer a better quality and more variety of seafood.  I would not recommend this Buffett to anyone."}
{"text":"let me break it down for ya...

PRICE: $14 all you can stuff your face extravaganza- *thumbs up*
SERVICE:: Its a buffet, do not expect much more than drink refills-
FOOD::  sushi bar with them making fresh stuff on spot which is pretty cool. a whole meat section- wide selection and pretty tasty also- you got your norms, soups won ton, egg drop etc, salads, fruit, lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp..Chicken wings..beef and broccoli..etc.. etc your normal Chinese food really. They do have crab it is cold, but you get piping hot butter which makes it better.
DESSERTS:: everything besides the \"chinese donuts\" as i like to call them i think are store bought to be honest but it's cool. they also have about 8 types of ice cream as well.
QUALITY: :If you go to a buffet i don't really think you have bitchin' rights because you get what you pay for. Yes somethings taste like they have been sittin out to long, some things run out, some are shitty and some are good..Buffets are usually a gamble. If you're hungry though it gets the job done. 
VERDICT::Good for a quick fix dinner night or for your stoner munchies( i mean you can get crab, orange chicken french fries and carrot cake all in one environment). Of course we prob all agree going to an actual Chinese, Asian ect restaurant is better but  this place does the job if your wanting to get your Chinese grub on at a cheap price.."}
{"text":"Holy $h1t 45 bucks for 2 people. Most expensive buffet ive ever been to. Food wasnt fresh and was barely warm. I should have went to a steak house for that much money! That food was worth 10 bucks per person tops."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet.  The selection is huge, unique dishes that are hard to find elsewhere, and great value.

I love the sushi, soups, salads, and variety of dishes available.  The service is great, and the ambiance is nice.

I always walk away satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood buffet by far. I love going here because the food is always fresh and their crab legs and mussels are always on point. I like that they have a wide their wide variety of Asian cuisines... not something you find at most seafood buffets here in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went here on a Sunday for lunch. They had several different types of cooked fish, dim sum and buns, different types of calamari, various chicken offerings and a few different types of soups including clam chowder. The miso soup was a bit salty, but it was still good. There was 8 different ice creams, various cakes, and a fruit and salad bar. There are several different types of crab and shrimp dishes and a huge sushi selection. A lot of the rolls were kind of spicy, but they had good nigiri. It was a bit expensive at about $20 but in my opinion this is the best buffet in the valley that I've been to at least.."}
{"text":"Think I'm giving this one 4 stars. I came during the week for lunch. There was plenty of amazing food. The spring rolls and crab puffs were both fantastic. The clam chowder was simply fantastic. The coconut shrimp was different than I'm used to as it was grilled shrimp in a coconut sauce instead of the usual type of coconut shrimp. The sushi that they had out did not contain any raw fish.... I thought one was a Philly roll but instead of salmon it was actually a strawberry. It was interesting. The orange chicken was pretty dry, but other than that the rest of the food was pretty decent. The ice cream was PERFECT. Usually it is hard as a rock but this was actually able to be scooped out. They also had a nice banana pudding desert."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese buffet by far. Tons of items you just don't see anywhere else. Quality of food is almost always at a high level. It gets crazy busy so sometimes the wait dampens the outing. Price is on par for what you get, it's not cheap but neither is the food and in the end you don't feel like you got ripped off. I don't really eat at any other Chinese buffet anymore, this is the place for me."}
{"text":"So I gave 3 years for this place to get its shit together, and it predictably failed. Something that was different was the amount of food-all the pans were refilled in a timely fashion, but with lots more gross-ass shit like snails and ground-dwelling fauna. 
Something that was the same was the ground zero-like cleanliness and appeal of the restroom. Lord. How do the employees stay clean enough to handle the food? I was pondering this when my husband showed me his fortune cookie that said \"don't panic.\" I hope that's coincidence and not their way of telling me that we now have monsters inside us or something. Oh and the bill for four of us (including child under 12), $78 dollars!! For sub standard guano that my body is terribly regretting right now. Never never never coming back here again."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, you love seafood and chinese food, and you have $14 bucks in your pocket, this is the place for you.

They have a nice variety of seafood, and they seem to restock it quickly. Everyone always complains about the crablegs being gone. It takes a while to cook them (correctly) and yes, they are popular. Go on a not so busy day, and you'll find plenty of them. The food is prepared very well, always seems fresh. Their sushi is ok. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. They have line 7 different buffet tables filled with a lot of good food, and even food your kids will like. The atmosphere  isn't horrible, but when it's busy, you can tell. I have gotten sat at a dirty table a few times. Ask them politely to wipe it and they will. All in all, I reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Glorified Chinese food buffet 


Decided to give this place a try for my sons birthday as he wanted crab legs.. to sum it up in a nut shell it was disgusting! 

The prices are extremely high for the quality and selection of food offered here. The buffet table is extremely disorganized with 85% of the food mislabeled.. If you have any type of food allergy I highly recommend staying away from this place at all costs. 

The service started out ok, we got a table as soon as we walked in the door and they took our drink order before we even sat down. We went to get some crab legs from the buffet and noticed that they were 95% gone with only a few stragglers in the bottom of the tray (the tray is marked \"pizza\").. I asked the lady that was stirring the dried up rice if they would be refilling the crab soon... She mumbled something under her breath and walked to the back to return with a small and I stress SMALL bowl of crab legs and poured them over the stragglers that were in the pan already.  There were about 8 other customers waiting for the crab as well and by the time 5 of us took a few pieces there wasn't enough to go around. We took our crab legs back to our table and cracked them open to find them smelly and a dark color not consistent of fresh food at all.  

My daughter took what was labeled as chicken and after biting into it found out that it was fish. 

After spending and hour and a half at the restaurant we never did get a decent amount of crab legs that was safe to eat and only got one refill on our drinks. Once the waitress figured out that we were not returning to the food trough she disappeared. It took 20 minutes to get our check after I asked two other servers to have our waitress bring it to us.  


$95 dollars later for four of us to eat crappy Chinese food and a few California rolls with Pepsi's to wash it all down with we were all ready to return home and pray that we weren't praying to the porcelain gods all night! 



Sub par food, poor service and way over priced earned this place one star in my opinion. Total rip off we won't be returning!!"}
{"text":"Dissapointing. 

I made the trip out to Pacific Seafood Buffet for crablegs on the recommendation of some other Yelpers and was really let down. The seafood selection was mostly fried or drenched in butter- even things i had never seen cooked that way at all like the crawfish. One type of crab was deep fried (which does not do justice to crab- just turns the meat into sawdust!)  When the steamed snow crab legs finally came out, they doled out just a few which the other patrons descended on and exhausted immediately. The boiled crab legs were not fresh- the crab meat was mushy and the shells would not break in half easily because they had been steamed for too long.

The upside: some decent surprises in the dim sum and korean barbecue section- good dumplings and spare ribs. The frog legs and pineapple sticky rice were also tasty. Skip the sushi bar though.

This place is ok as an asian buffet but disappoints for seafood. If you don't live close skip the long drive."}
{"text":"The second location (Bell Rd in Peoria)is much cleaner than the one in Chandler.  The tables don't smell like dirty rags."}
{"text":"Wow, what happened?  The place was great the first time around.  The upkeep is horrible.  My booth had a bad stench.  You know, that dirty rag smell.  The sushi is such low quality.  The food didn't look fresh at all.  I didn't even want to try the ice cream.  It was so messy.  I don't think I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We had not been there in years and this was a complete disappointment. Maybe going at 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon wasn't the best idea, but if you're a restaurant open for business, do it right. Things on the steam tables which should have been hot were barely above room temperature, The pot stickers were on such a thick pile of lettuce that they actually WERE room temperature as they were too far from the steam underneath, and the fruit was NOT cold, This is not a SAFE or a tasty way to serve food. The only things I felt safe eating is when they just brought out a new tray of freshly prepared food before it had a chance to get cold. Service was also very sketchy - and you know at that hour it's not because they were busy.

Really the only decent thing I had was the rainbow sherbet and coconut macaroon. Pitiful. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place stinks of fish, which is something I always like to mention for those who have a strong sense of smell, like I do.  Beyond that, I love it here!  On weekends, it's impossible to find a time that isn't ridiculously packed and busy.  Yesterday (Sunday), they actually ran out of ice for drinks for a brief period!!  I really enjoy the sushi here and could just eat that all night.  There is a nice assortment of Chinese food items, Mongolian-style barbecue and seafood delights, like crab legs and frog legs.  The desserts are great; the best is the variety of ice creams!  The service was fine for a buffet.  The table was kept clean and the drinks kept full.  I've brought many special guests here.  $41 for three people to eat an enormous Sunday dinner with drinks... not bad at all!  If they could do something to counteract that terrible fishy smell, I'd give this place 5 stars.  ;)  They also offer take-out prices by the pound!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Asian buffet places but this is by far the best I have ever been to. The service is very attentive and I like that the cooks go out to the floor often to check on the quantity and quality of the selection. My favorite is the barbecue pork that has just the right amount of carmelized glaze char that is indicative of being fresh off the grill. Free Wifi and all you can eat Chinese food?!?! ZOMG! My only complaint is the price but I have to tell you the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"When we got to this location we clearly asked the lady that was closing in the next hour or so if the food was still fresh and hot. Of course she lied to us half of the food was already cold and was not even warm enough to eat. And the sushi was funny tasting the fish taste so fake. I would not come back just seems like another Chinese buffet to me."}
{"text":"The food was quite amazing! But unfortunately the service was not. If you're looking for a great seafood buffet this is the place! But if you like your drink filled in reasonable manner it is not."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Very pricey for a Chinese buffet. I probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"First of all, we went here on an usual day for any restaurant. It was Christmas. Long story as to the reason I ended up with a friend at a Chinese restaurant on Christmas Day.

Staff was friendly, place was clean. A variety of boo-fay offerings. The thing was the availability of some dishes. Crab legs, which I didn't have, seemed to be as scarce as an honest politician. Same for some of the beef dishes. The dessert select was good. 

It's possible the kitchen couldn't keep up with holiday demand, but it's something the kitchen should have known would happen.

Of course, I'll come here again. See if there are more or less stars in their future."}
{"text":"My husband and I started going to this place after reading the reviews, I have to say awesome food, their sushi is the best I have ever had. We highly recommend this place, we are weekly customers and the food is fresh, sushi the best and the waiters are very nice and friendly they know how to tend to you"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the buffet.  We got there right as they opened (11 am) and they were just finishing putting everything on the buffet floor so everything was super fresh!  The waitress was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  We were pleased by the quality of the food especially for the price--just $10 each!  Loved that they had other options for dining besides exclusively chinese and seafood.  Our only concern was that the restaurant was going to be inside Arrowhead Towne Center just because their address seemed awfully close.  We were relieved to find out that it wasn't and that there was ample parking space. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"It's good at the beginning of my dinner with my mom before she moves out of town and at the end one of the workers stand there take a napkin off a dirty table that was left there when  the customers left and he then started digging in ears with his finger first and started using the napkin and after a few minutes of doing that then he started to brush is hair with his hand then I saw stand around the corner and started talking never went to wash his hands I lost my appetite couldn't eat anymore almost lost my dinner then we talked to the asst manager and she was nice at the beginning and left for a few and my mom talked to her about taking just my off because I didn't get a chance to finish my dinner oh man her attitude change from nice to really snotty about it and she started to give us attitude I will never go back there don't know what other employees do there where we can't see and don't wash their hands nasty never again will be calling manager in morning about this"}
{"text":"Pricey, but that's because of the great food selection they have there.  It's well worth the price IMO, plus it's clean, the food rotates because it's popular, and I've not heard of one person getting sick from eating here."}
{"text":"Every dish here was delicious. It had great appearances and the aurora was fantastic. Additionally, the prices were correspondingly priced with the food quality."}
{"text":"The good:  Unlimited seafood for 14 bucks.  This includes sushi and crab legs.

The bad:  Okay, it isn't bad, per se, but most of the food tastes like buffet food.  It is generally good, but after trying a little of most everything they had to offer, nothing stands out as something I just have to have more of.  They do an excellent job at serving tons of good seafood to tons of people.  The sushi was good, not great, but for the money, it was a really nice addition to the menu.  Also, see below...

The funny:  Well, it wasn't funny at the time...but it made for some interesting people watching...  I'm not sure if they have crab legs every night, but the night I went they did.  They were very busy that night, and crab legs were obviously the main thing people came in for.  It seemed like they rationed the crab legs by bringing them in in 10-15 minute intervals, so for much of the visit, the section of the buffet where they served them would be empty.  

As soon as the employees would bring out the next load of them, people descended on them like famished scavengers.  One time, I was fortuitous enough to be at the right place at the right time when they came out, and there was only one man between me and a few crab legs.  I patiently waited while he filled his plate with as many as he could carry back.  I stepped forward and all of a sudden a little girl, about eight, stepped in front of me and grabbed the tongs and said \"Can I have one?\"  I said sure (as any other respectable man in the presence of a cute eight year old with cute dreadlocks would do, right?), and I let her ahead.  

About 30 seconds later, her plate was filled higher than the man before me--and between her and the other side (you can access the crab legs from two sides of the buffet, nearly entire stock had been taken.  I did get a few of the small leftovers that were somehow left, and retreated to my seat.

As I sat down, I saw two women in a nearby booth...each of which probably had their own gravitational pull.  Their entire table was filled with plates of crab legs and the sad aftermath of the crab carnage that had taken place in the preceding moments.  As it turns out, there were three different tables of people who were all together, probably 15 people in all.  The little girl I so graciously let in front of me belonged to one of them, as did the ladies.  All three tables had massive amounts of crab legs, even the table with only young kids...who in reality probably had no real hope of enjoying them because they had no adult supervision...and no obvious way to open them.

After watching for a few minutes, I realized that the two planets, I mean, ladies, never got up.  Instead, I saw that each of the kids at the various tables was taking shifts to get to the crab legs as they were brought out from the back.  Each kid would go up and collect as many as he or she could and bring it back to be divvied up amongst the tables.  Sometimes two kids would each attack a side of the buffet, leaving little or nothing for the remainder of us.

The little girl was no little girl at all, she was but a mere sattelite charged with collecting all the crab legs she could to satiate the hunger of the mothership.

That's a long story to tell you that while the allure of crab legs is a strong one, be prepared to fight, stalk, and trick your way into getting your share of them.  Personally, while they are good, I'd rather go somewhere that charges a few more bucks but doesn't ration the product--allowing an impolite galaxy of scavengers to ruin it for everyone else.  

Still four stars for it because as an overall the place was impressive, but maybe they could figure some way around this problem by having a server bring the crab legs to each individual table as needed on a more even basis."}
{"text":"It needs a renovation desperately. Looks great from a distance but you walk up and the windows are very dirty, broken blinds barely hanging there and right at the entry way is a big pile of Bird droppings! Really?!? Clean that up!! Who wants to see that as a first impression? Very Hot and Humid inside, turn on the air. Very old inside! The back parking near the Dumpster was horrible. The Dumpster area was piled high of boxes and trash just thrown in there, boxes weren't even broke down. So disappointed as this was our first time! We definitely won't be going back and I won't recommend this Restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to they offer crab legs but it's not crab legs it's just deep fried shells the hot food was cold the cold food was hot didn't even want to eat the sushi thought I was going to get food poisoning would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I am no buffet raider by any means, but from time to time, I may have an itch to go to one.

If you roll up on a prime evening such as Sunday or Saturday, you will most likely wait.  This is not new information here, just a norm around these Asian buffets.

Based on my two experiences, thus far, Asians seem to be the primary demographic here, but that should not deter you from having a decent buffet dinner.

The nice, tiled lobby holds around 20 seats if you do end up waiting.  Once your name is called, the host takes you to your determined table and let the feast begin.

The sushi bar offers a small variety of sushi and other fresh salads that is mediocre at best. 

The rest of buffet offers a plethora of different things that you see often at just about every place.  I cannot highlight one or two things that just pops, it truly is nothing out of the ordinary.

In comparison to other Asian buffets in this part of town, I would feel confident in making this my go-to."}
{"text":"I like to come here on occasion to eat their crab and their salmon sashimi.  There are other items which aren't too bad either.  They have a wide array of chinese food, seafood, a Mongolian stir fry area, dessert and salads.  This is defeinitely one of the better buffets that I have been to.  Only thing I hate is how people hoard the crab."}
{"text":"This buffet is a keeper, good crab legs if you dare want to battle for them. 

Love the salt and pepper shrimp with the shell and head. Have to tear off the head but eat the rest, shell and legs to appreciate the flavor. If you remove the shell, may as well eat the shrimp cocktail.

Another favorite is the salt and pepper frog legs (taste like chicken) and the kalbi korean short ribs and the other dishes in the bbq section.

Just when you think you are stuffed, have to get some of the self serve ice cream that is available.

You will leave wishing you really did not earlier but satisfied.

Probably the best asian seafood buffet in town, just wish we did not have to drive 30 miles to get there, but if you are in the area, it is a must.

There is a reason why 90% of the people eating there are asians"}
{"text":"hands down the best chinese seafood buffet - salt and pepper shrimp and kalbi short ribs"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to check this new seafood buffet out and weren't too impressed. I thought we would have a lot more seafood options, but ended up being more Chinese, Korean and sushi. There were only 2 fish dishes offered, although a lot of shrimp dishes. There was also snow crab legs which were somewhat little, but nevertheless, all you can eat. The sushi bar was good, but not too many options there either. They have a stir fry bar as well which my husband liked. Overall, the food was good, but I don't think it was worth the money of $16 a person. The service was great and the buffet was clean and refilled often."}
{"text":"As of right now, this is my favorite buffet by far.
  The selection of dishes is huge and everything was tasty! Flavorful and satisfying.  
  They have a man who walks around and continually tells the kitchen what to bring out, so there is never too long of a wait.
  When the crab legs come out you will always get the \"shark\" who takes 90% of what is in the tray, so try to have someone in the line of sight so you can get some - or post your largest diner right there and beat that shark to the sweet, delish crab.  ( I shouldn't have told you my strategy)
  The shrimp shu mai was actually some of the best we have had in years, the beef skewers were super meaty and done perfectly - not dried out like you get at other buffets.
  They have a large selection of desserts, a teppanyaki counter and a sushi bar with some pretty nice selections.
  I had never seen snails at a buffet before, but they seemed to be a hit with others as I kept seeing people take them.
  The place was clean and not too loud.
We noticed that the waitress did not keep coming around to refill the drinks - another ploy used at some places to get you full- but she did keep us from going dry.  She was not too talkative, but I was not there for conversation, I was there to pig out. And I did.
  I really can not bash any one dish, everything we tried was good.
  It seemed a bit pricey, but the food was so tasty and plentiful that it was worth it."}
