{"text":"This is definitely the best Asian restaurant in the century III area.. If you want to drive much farther The Sesame Inn is probably the best.. But in the century III area this is where I always go.. I've been getting take out from here for about 5 years.. I've never had any problems.. it's a great treat.. I've checked every other Asian restaurant within 5 miles of here.. Good customer service.. I'm never disappointed.. Good prices too"}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese place in the area. Food is very good and lots of options. The vegetable lo mein is some of the best I've had, egg rolls are good sized and can't go wrong with any dish. If you are looking for real spicy, you may have to add sauce yourself. I've asked for 10 out of 10 heat on things and barely noticed, but that's my only compliant. Also, very large portions at good prices as others have said.  They deliver too which is a plus."}
{"text":"Just visiting in the area for the day and decided to try food here. Fantastic Chinese food. 3 of us ordered, and all 3 of us loved it. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect have been disappointed in almost all both large and small Chinese restaurants and take out in the Baldwin Whitehall Shannon and Bethel areas in the past few years. Tried China Ichiban today for the first time.The food was great! We had egg rolls steamed dumplings, lo mein mixed veggies in garlic sauce and of course the obligatory General Tso. Veggie egg rolls seemed to be hand rolled not the premade and the dumplings where plump and fresh. The veggies where cooked perfectly and the sauces weren't over powering the Tso's was as good as any I've ever had. After all that said the prices are just as good as the food. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Its pretty standard Chinese food. If you're looking for the most mind blowing Chinese food ever, this isn't it but you shouldn't expect it to be either. It's strip mall Chinese food. The delivery was fast and the gentleman was kind, however they did forget my entree. The egg rolls are good and the beef lo mein and beef and broccoli both were very good. The shrimp fried rice tasted just like oil to me but my mom enjoyed it. The cold noodles weren't the best. The sauce tasted more like sugar than peanut butter but all in all definitely not a bad place."}
{"text":"This the place we go to for Chinese!  Always prompt with delivery, hot food, good portions, and the price is great!  When we moved here, we had a hard time finding a good Chinese place but this now our go to!  We tried many different places, but this is the best bang for our buck.  We love this place.  I get a bit of a variety depending on my mood and have always enjoyed what I got.  They messed up my order once, but it wasn't that big of a deal honestly.  It won't stop me from ordering from them!  They usually give us a free egg roll or something so that is always a nice perk, but I would still order from them regardless."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best General Tso's in all of Pittsburgh. Fast delivery and the food isn't soggy like you get from some take out places. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite delivery Chinese food restaurant in the area. It's always good. Exactly as it should be. Crab rangoons are amazingggg. The best I can find in pittsburgh honestly."}
{"text":"Decided to give China Ichiban a try...they didn't disappoint !The egg rolls,beef lo mein,chicken chow mein,general tso's ,all very good.We had been looking for a good Chinese place and were so glad we found it !Prices are reasonanble too.Do yourself a favor and check them out ! Don't understand the 1 negative review....guess you can't please everyone.Try them,you'll like them !"}
{"text":"Great place for takeout! Ordered lunch and for just $5 I got my entree, rice and an egg roll. Some of the best General Tsao's I've had! Def would recommend again!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese takeout or delivery. I have always been happy with my meal. I wanted to write this review, as I noticed there aren't any and I have been ordering from Here for over 2 years. It is by far the best in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered from them once. I did not like their food at all. My teenage son and his friends will grab Lo mein from them but that's it."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place in the Century III area. A nice family run joint, there are only 2 tables which indicates that they are more about take out and delivery rather than waiter service. If you wanted to eat there you still could but with a 10-15 minute wait time you won't bring home cold food. I love seeing their kids running around the \"dining area.\" It's rare to see family businesses that area actually run by families.  FOOD - I love a reasonable price for a nice portion size. I have tried something new every time because I have my select favorites from my hometown Chinese place back in TX. I must say though I have not often been disappointed. To only order once and give one star is crazy, their menu is so vast I'm sure anyone can find something to try.  -Sesame Chicken: Their sesame chicken is by far my husband's favorite in PA, TX, and NY This dish is sweet, tangy, juicy, and comes with just a few bits of broccoli which is nice that they don't try to skimp on the chicken. -Lo Mein (Shrimp & Combination): This is not my favorite Lo Mein that I've had. They use large bits of celery which overpowers the nice flavor of the lo mein sauce. Pro: Even when I ordered the shrimp they were generous with their shrimp. I felt like I could have a piece of shrimp or part of a shrimp (because they are large) with every bite.  -Steamed Chicken with Broccoli: This is a tasty healthier option if you don't feel like cooking but you still want something light and flavorful.  -Wonton Soup: What can I say? Their dumplings are fill with meat and it's good. There is not much room to mess up wonton soup. -Hot and Sour Soup: My favorite H&S is in TX. That one has a hint of sweet and is super spicy. The H&S here is more traditional, on the thicker side as far as texture, and has a nice extra dash of what tastes like black pepper.  -General Tso's Chicken: I enjoyed this lightly spicy, sweet dish. -Orange Flavor Beef: The beef is breaded which I am not quite used to yet. I prefer mine non-breaded but would I worder this again? Yes, yes I would."}
{"text":"Not good.  Cashew chicken was mostly broccoli stems.  Pretty much all broccoli stems with too much sauce and like 2 cashews and a couple pieces of chicken.  My question is why the hell are broccoli stems in cashew chicken anyway?  Other dishes were also subpar.  Weird sauces and lots of fillers.  Didn't even give any fortune cookies...wtf?"}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about this place so I decided to give it a try! The food was really good-still got to me hot. But the reason I took off two stars is because they messed up our egg rolls (was supposed to be 1 pork, 1 veggie....they gave us 2 pork) so I couldn't eat mine. But that's not really a big deal. The second star I took off bc it took an HOUR to get here. We had a very small order. 1 lunch special, one extra egg roll, side of rice. That's it. We also only live maybe 5 minutes away. I ordered online so maybe that's a factor? Either way, way too long to wait in my opinion. Foods good tho!! If you have time to wait or can pick it up, I recommend it!"}
