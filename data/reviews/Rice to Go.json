{"text":"Great food for a good price.  The Szechuan beef is the best I have had in the Gta and their rice is delicious. There is a big choice of Thai and Chinese food. I love this place, and the staff are always friendly. The best take out in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you need a quick fix for North America's take on Chinese food this is a good spot. Food is always hot and has never disappointed. You won't break the bank at this place and you'll have food for days."}
{"text":"Always get the rice bowls with general tso or Thai red curry chicken. The pricing is really good and you get a load of food and quickly."}
{"text":"There is nothing Chinese about this place. Just look at who is taking your order. Food is so-so plasticky."}
{"text":"I have finally decided this is my \"go-to place\" for Chinese and Thai dishes.  The are very accommodating and will alter the ingredients (ie chicken instead of pork and shrimp) by request - no questions asked.  The Singapore noodles are awesome, and again, we ask for chicken only - no problem.  Shanghai noodles were amazing too, and as one reviewer said, massive portions.  I also love the option of having Thai or Chinese/Szechuan options.  Delivery is quick.  I highly recommend Rice to Go"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Durham! The house combo is what I love! Fast service and the food is filling and tasty."}
{"text":"This is a small shop.... really small but also you get really really good food for the price.  Their family combos make sense and food has always been tasty.  I specifically recommend the Black Pepper Beef with Fried Rice - Rice bowl combo.  Their wings are also some of the best wings I have had from an Asian Restaurant hands down.  I advise calling in your order as they do not have much room in the store front to wait."}
{"text":"Rice To Go is located in a plaza with a small store front. It has minimal seating for those waiting for their food, so it's best to order ahead to avoid standing around. They are pretty quick and often have specials! 

My favourite rice bowl is Mongolian Beef. The combination of fresh vegetables, sweet and spicy tender beef has me coming back. It was the first thing I tried there, so I have trouble trying other dishes!  

TIDBIT! Not in the mood for rice? They will replace the rice with udon noodles! My family orders them all the time!  

The food here is so fresh, I had to write about them. Everything is made to order, not ahead of time. They have a large menu, so I'm sure you'll change your mind 10 times before settling....but in the back of your mind, you've already got the dish picked out for your next visit! 

Not in the mood for cooking, but don't want to get out of your track pants? Pick it up or have it delivered.  

Never go hungry again!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is nice. Thai food not so much. Service is good, prices good, quantity good."}
{"text":"I love this place ...great value tasty food you can walk out of there for dinner under 8 bucks"}
{"text":"Parking, debit, cash and credit all available. In the plaza with KFC off Thickson. 

Only tried a few things, as I liked what I tried and ordered again! Customer service has consistently been good, all the women/girls who have served me on the various times I went for pick, were friendly and nice. This is definitely a pick up or a delivery place, little to no tables here. Good prices on the combination plates.

Food: Fried rice, general tsos and Asian spring roll I've tried and love! I've tried a few times the deep fried dumplings, but they are a bit unmentionable for me. See below for the deats.

I've tried the chicken, pork and house fried rice - both extremely good and fresh. I haven't tried too many Chinese places in Whitby, but the rice is on point here. 

I've had the general tsos, in the combo - which was also delish- crispy, deep fried and the sauce was right - little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour. It doesn't turn soggy because it isn't drowned in sauce. Which is amazing.

Dumplings are deep fried only - I wouldn't order again as I don't prefer deep fried dumplings. They do not offer pan fried or steam. I asked, they said no.

And lastly, their Asian spring rolls - love these. Try them."}
{"text":"We typically do delivery and never an issue. The food is fresh and hot...and delicious. Its hard to get good Asian food prepared and served in a clean and tidy environment. RTG is just that. If you and your family are tired after a long day and you crave deep fried wontons or soo guy, this is the spot."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Its better to call to place an order if you are in a hurry. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Loved this place. An authentic Chinese takeaway.

We were skeptical about eating here but just gave it a try and it was worth it.

My husband ordered chicken with fried rice which he said was superb. I ordered egg rolls and veggie noodles. And slurp slurp. My mouth is watering again remembering about its taste. 

The food had optimum spices and optimum oil. And the aroma was worth dying for. Plus the hostesses were very polite.

A must try :)"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It's the only restaurant I crave going back to. Try the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice. Sooooo delicious"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it tasted bad or offensive. I just found it very bland, boring and lacking in flavour."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on a weekday. Our ordered arrived 1 1/2 hour later. We ordered spring rolls, pineapple rice and crunchy Szechuan chicken. The spring rolls have way too much pastry and not enough stuffing. The rice tasted stale and the chicken was burnt! We literally threw out all the food. We will not be ordering again, nor recommend them."}
{"text":"Rice to go is a one of my favourite lunch spots to pick up one their \"Rice Bowls\" , but I have also had take dinners her as well and its quite good.

Lunch ranges from $5-7 and they have a frequent diner stamp card which gives you a free lunch after 10 stamps (I am on my third card..LOL)

Clean and tidy..worth checking out."}
{"text":"Still our #1 Chinese joint to go to for takeout!! Last week, I decided to try something new and I got the Thai Glass Noodles - YUM!!

The portion is RIDICULOUS!! We totally could have split this and there would have been enough noodles for FOUR people! This dish had a nice heat to it, spicy but not unbearable, and chicken and shrimpies cooked to perfection. As always, we added an order of mini samosas (delicious as always) and I got a thai spring roll, which I dont' think I'd get again. it was okay but nothing special and not nearly as delicious as the regular egg roll.

You won't regret coming here, great food, generous portions, ready fast!"}
{"text":"I've been eating a Rice To Go for years. It's a little place with great takeout and their rice bowls are the perfect meal. I usually can't finish one and just save the rest for lunch the next day.

I don't eat fried food and they've substituted plain chicken in whatever sauce, like General Tao or Thai Sweet and Sour whenever I've asked, really accommodating and a nice family run place."}
