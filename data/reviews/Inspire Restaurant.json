{"text":"Loved this place. Went for a friend's birthday and it did not disappoint. The salmon burger is a must try. Excellent. Make sure to call ahead and make reservations as there aren't too many seats."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today for an early lunch. Place was empty at 11:30 on Sat but quickly filled up by noon.

Food was DELISH!! I can't decide which of the items my friend and I ordered would be my favorite - Soft shell crab pakora, butter chicken serpentine and banana bread French toast with coconut and vanilla. Can't wait to go back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for couples, its fusion food menu is unique and well prepped.  IF you want to try new dishes, here's the place to be.  I would come back again with my wife for our anniversary.  Servers were pro and courteous."}
{"text":"This small restaurant on Markham Main St is a welcome addition!  I have been for both brunch and dinner, but it is often packed so I would definitely suggest making a reservation.  They advertise themselves as a fusion restaurant, and their menu certainly lives up to that claim!  The menu is limited, but delicious.  I had the chicken and waffles.  I was wondering why there were little meringues on my plate and thought it quite odd.  When I tried it with the rest my dish, I found that the sweetness of the meringue paired nicely with the saltiness of the chicken.  My fiance had the burger and it was delicious.  And those fries..yummy!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go for good food in Markham, and reasonably priced!! Only downsides are that the location is super Far East (for the people who live in west Markham/Richmond hill/north York etc.) and that there is limited seating for the dinner crowd. Definitely would recommend reserving before showing up! 

Inspire burger and fries are a must! 4/7 people in our group opted for it and we all enjoyed it! The portions were big and the flavours were delicious! 

We ordered a few glasses of wine, and two of the cups had things in it.. one had a fruit fly, and the other a remnant of food! They were nice about pouring us new glasses, so we didn't mind too much! I know some people would find that off-putting!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. A little gem on Markham Main St.  Not a ton of selection but everything on the menu is 5 star."}
{"text":"Delicious Food!!!! I had the Stonefruit salad with the spicy shrimp and finished with the macaroon. Both dishes were amazing! Highly recommend this place :-)"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! Super delicious! Nice fusion food and great service. 

I love the udon carbonara best! really creamy with lots of mushroom and bacon bits, tasted just perfect, probably the best I have ever had, really like the sauce. I will definitely order this dish again next time. 

Pulled pork frites tasted good, the pulled pork was really juicy but im not really a fries person so didn't eat much of it. My friend who ordered it loved it and said it was a good combination. 
 
pulled pork waffles - again the pulled pork was really flavourful, tasty and juicy but tasted a bit weird when you eat it with the waffles. I might try the chicken and waffles next time instead of pulled pork waffle. 

Small restaurant and it fills up fast so it's best to call in ahead of time to make a reservation. Nice decor inside the restaurant but I find it a bit too dark. Will definitely return to try out other plates they have to offer."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and service is great! Their Burger and Duck taco is amazing. Just wish they have a kids menu."}
{"text":"Loved walking in to this restaurant - I felt like walking into Japan as I walked through the curtains. The interior is unique and creative.

Absolutely loved the menu. There were so many things I wanted to try, and I really love the creative fusion.I had the Chicken & Waffle; chicken was very crunchy, and the berry compote really complimented the ginger maple sauce. My boyfriend got the Matcha cheesecake burger, which had two patties and a piece of matcha cheesecake in between - which surprisingly was very delicious. Didn't get to try any desserts as we were full, but definitely coming back to Inspire again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for brunch and to my surprise the restaurant didn't open until 1130, we walked in and the hostess immediately asked if we had reservations.  We were  seated even without a reservation as they had 1 last table for us (party of 2).  The restaurant feels nice and cozy the decor defiantly had a modern feel to it.  Service was very prompt and they came by several times to fill our water without asking.  As for the food the menu was very limited to a handful of dishes. We ended up ordering the inspire burger with the pulled pork fries upgrade and the chicken waffle.  The food portions were rather big but tasted rather average. The total came to about $45 all in for lunch/brunch. I feel like for this price range. I can go somewhere else thst offer more options. But overall I had a decent experience here and the dishes here are quite unique and can't be found at many restaurants."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great food, great service and clean. 

So good. Such generous portions. Shared both of these dishes and couldn't finish. Servers were nice (but very busy). 

INSP Burger 
- such a good burger, I think there's cheese in the actual meet 
- no ketchup and IT WORKS 
- fries that came with (regular fries) were so delicious: seasoned well, no ketchup and it WORKS 

Waffles + Chicken 
- Just delicious 
- wish there was a layer of the mango edamame in between the waffles 
- wish there were a few more berries I had one blueberry and one raspberry 

Overall, it was amazing. The flavour profiles of both dishes were so different, a little strange, but worked very well. Enjoyed thoroughly. The place is clean and intimate. Servers are great. Different waiters were helping our table, not just one. And they packed our leftovers (there was about ~35-40% left)."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. 

Between myself and fellow diners got the chicken and waffles, butter chicken penne, banana bread French toast and east Burger. 

Good chicken and waffles - chicken was spiced well and delicious, but dish overall could have used a bit more sweetness to put it over the top. Butter chicken pasta was good as well - not as heavy as expected or overpowering. Banana bread French toast was good but could have used a bit more savoury touch - too sweet for a brunch item. Burger was good - nice patty cooked well on a nice soft bun, but would have loved for the pineapple to come out a bit more. 

Overall a great experience and would come back for sure. All the items on the menu look like they've had a lot of thought put into them. Portions are generous as well. 

Make reservations if going for a weekend night as it's not a huge space."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place two of my friends of mine decided to finally give it a shot. 

The place is small and the the outside doesn't really scream for attention. However the decor inside suits the place. We were seated by the window/front door. If you get seated here in the winter like we did, I'd ask to get seated elsewhere. The cold drafts and the uncomfortable chairs at these tables were not that desirable. 

The place does get busy so I would definitely suggest making reservations to ensure you get a table. The menu isn't that extensive but I wouldn't expect it to be considering the size of the place and the smaller menu allows for them to focus on keying in on the great dishes they serve. 

The selection of beers was rather disappointing but I wasn't there for the beer. The food was the focal point. 

We had ordered the Chicken and Waffles, Duck Confit fries, and the Inspire Burger. I didn't personally have the chicken and waffles but I was told it was good and worth the travel to this place. I had the Inspire burger and wow is this burger good. The key ingredients of the seared pork belly and fried egg were excellent!! The duck confit fries were also amazing. Don't hesitate to order these items. 

I would definitely return to try the other items on the menu. The service was ok but felt like the guy was trying a little too hard. He was nice and not annoying. 

Go here and have the inspire burger!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and it was a great experience. We tried the following dishes:

- diver scallops with sweet pea puree and picked chilis
- the inspire burger + pulled pork fries
- udon carbonara
- de-constructed trinity creme

All the dishes were absolutely delish! I especially enjoyed the scallops and pulled pork fries. Will certainly be back to try their brunch menu too!"}
{"text":"I was worried this place was just overly hyped up from instagram/Yelp but it did not disappoint! A little hard to find at night all you can see is the word 'restaurant' with inspire written under in small letters.  Large parking lot in the back. Great decor/ atmosphere inside. Good idea to make reservations, there just happened to be a table open for 2 when we went for a late dinner (9pm).

Hawaiian Ahi Poke - Ahi Tuna Cubes marinated in Chili Sesame Soy + Green Onion + Crispy Shallots Served w/ Semolina Crisp ($13). I was expecting larger chunks marinated fish, it was almost minced. This is the only dish I wouldn't order again

Panko Scotch Egg- Pork + Gold Nori Egg + Spicy Berry Compote ($5). This was delicious well balanced with radish and berry compote 

Udon Carbonara - Spicy Chorizo + Braised Beef  + Honey Mushrooms in Creamy White Wine reduction Topped w/ Quails Egg ($18). If you're a fan of creamy noodle dishes, you'll love this. I didn't find the dish too spicy.

De-constructed Trinity Creme - Ginger Cardamom Custard + Hard Candy + Meringue Base ($9). Great presentation, the ginger custard was delicious!

I will definitely come back for dinner and hope to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"I tried their grilled calamari and the Inspire Burger with pull pork frites. The burger was surprisingly juicy n flavorful. I thought it would be very oily n fat with the pork belly in the middle, but the portion of that belly is just right to add the good flavor to the burger. Loved it. One of the best burger I have ever tasted. Would definitely come back for this. However the grilled calamari is average and the portion is rather small. Service was great tho. I give 5 star!"}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant at the North end of markham main St. It's nice to see places open up in this area as it gives nice food options for those in markham who do not want to travel downtown. 

Went here for lunch, had the chicken and waffles and the pulled pork and waffles. Definitely one of the better places for chicken and waffles and the only place I've encountered that has pork and waffles. Chicken was well cooked, moist and boneless! A nice plus. 
Waffles were a little soggy but not bad. 

Would definitely come back for dinner/brunch!"}
{"text":"First time there, won't be our last. 
We ordered soft shell pakora, chicken and waffles, and a salmon burger. All 12 bucks each. 
The soft shell crab was all in one whole piece so it was nice to see what you're actually getting. Good texture and mix of sauces. 
Chicken and waffles...Didn't know meat could be that moist... Okay may be I did, but you get the idea haha. Lots of herbs taste but very good. 
Salmon burger and fries, also delicious. I'd get it again, but too bad Im eyeing all the other burgers on the menu to try. Everything they brought out for others made me wish I didn't have self control. 
Great experience. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with an interesting variety of fusions dishes. Worth trying out if you're looking for something new to try! Good portions, service and fair pricing."}
{"text":"So far since they have opened up I have been here around 4 times.. and every single time I find myself craving for the pulled pork frites. There's just something about the sauce and combination of flavours that has me addicted! I have also tried most of their menu (came as a big group two out of the four times and we all took a bite of each others meals) and I must say everything tasted quite impressive. 
I personally really enjoy eating the Udon carbonara as it has a very unique flavour to it that I have never tasted before. It may be a tad creamier than what I would normally like, but hey, food can't match people's preferences 100% all the time right? The only thing I wish for is if  they had a slightly larger selection of food  on their menu. 
As for the service, as I have read in a few reviews, I don't think it's particularly 'amazing' and out of this world, but it is good. I do appreciate the regular water refills and do like how they kindly answer any questions I may have about their menu. The girl with the ponytail seems to know what she's doing. I see her quite often behind the bar and out waiting tables and she seems to do a great job. Kudos to the servers and the chefs for making this a great restruant to eat at. ~"}
{"text":"Food's pretty good. One star less and maybe 3 star for some because of a rather cold attitude when you enter. I understand it's a busy place and they don't have trouble filling the seats. However, it would still be nice to be treated like a guest rather than unwanted company."}
{"text":"Very small place but it was good enough for our party of 7 people.

We ordered the following food
Panko Scotch Egg $5 - Very tasty, but I'm not sure if all scotch egg yolks are suppose to be cooked, theirs seems a bit over cooked, but overall taste was yummy

Duck Taco $12 - We couldn't taste the duck within it at all, and there was nothing special about this taco

Pulled pork \"Grilled Cheese\" Pizza Pie $15 - I expect it to be very cheesy like a grill cheese, but the cheese was cold melted on the waffle and the pull pork was just sitting on top which made the waffle soggy and chewy

Chicken & Waffle $12 - DELICIOUS !!!! AMAZING !!!! FRESH FRESH GOOD GOOD !!! 

The INSP Burger -$15 and we added $4 for the duck confit fries - The burger was tasty the meat was juice, overall a good burger
** our serve put in a wrong order for our fries so we got pulled pork fries, after advising him we got a complimentary duck confit fries ! 
The fries were very soft, but overall the combination of all of the condiments on top the friest complimented each other. Our group preferred the pull pork, because you couldn't really taste the duck at all in the fries

We ordered another burger which was new on the menu which came with 2 patties it was very juice again, but a bit to much meat for my liking we added pulled pork fries to this order


Udon Carbonara -$18 - SO GOOD !!!! The sauce is creamy and velvety!!!

We order a daily special which I forgot what it's called it had a mango papaya slaw with fish wrapped around a crunch wrap -something that resembles a taco but it wasn't anything special

Cake cutting cost is $1.5 per person

Service was lacking, we had to keep waiving servers to attend to our needs ( water? cutlery? plates? ) They are a very busy restaurant with good food but if the service could meet those standards it would be best.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Friends always wanted to try so by chance we managed to get a reservation that same night after a tiring day at wonderland w the kids. We started out w the Duck Taco and soft shell crab. Duck Taco was delicious even though I usually avoid parsley it was a crucial part of this and I am glad I didn't pick it out and trusted the chef. Soft shell crab was good but I personally preferred the more crunchy Japanese interpretation. 
On to the main course, my wife was not too fond of the chicken waffle and hence the star reduction. I however will have to say the Inspire burger was the best burger I ever had. It was probably not what my doctor would prescribe as the oil from the seared pork belly and the yolk of the egg busted out the moment I attempted to pick up the burger so beware :D. I really should never go back again but I find myself longing for that experience again. How it all just melted away in my mouth I can't even remember the flavour/texture of the bread. Our friends were raving about Inspire burger as well as the Udon Carbonara so overall we really enjoyed our experience. The service was on par, friendly and welcoming. Maybe I make it my reward for every 10-20lbs I loose :("}
{"text":"I don't know if it makes sense to add another review to the many already here but I honestly am puzzled the ratings have gone down to 4 rather than higher.  First of all, my son (9) loves to repeat that this is still one of the top rated restaurants in Markham, and, he adds, their burger is his favourite out of all he's tried-- and believe me, he's tried 'em all!  The food is truly outstanding, not just downtown TO level, but world-class, the professionalism of the chefs is truly mind-blowing.  We have been numerous times and have never been disappointed, and were pleased on a recent visit to see some new additions to the menu, all or most of which we tried in a large group.  A huge new item is the 'flower octopus' which is basically a baby whole octopus or two deep fried a la calamari, and then tossed with a chili sauce, medium hot, some crunchy veggies judiciously chosen and a lump or two of ricotti-- believe it or not, it works!  Here the ricotti kind of serves the role of the paneer used in Indian cooking.  A pork taco is so good I can without hesitation say it's better than 99 percent of Mexican restos we've been to--  and our family has traveled all over the US of A and in just about every city had Mexican, including in Cali where they really know how to do it.  The duck taco remains from the original menu as well as the old favourites rendang curry, udon carbonara, chicken and waffles, and all the juicy burgers.  The pulled pork frites are a winning dish and hopefully will never disappear off the menu.  One interesting new addition is the sloppy joe burrito which uses rendang beef and coconut rice with the usual mexican cheese and tomato in what appears to be a homemade flour tortilla...  creative!

But wait, there's more.  These guys also have a Hawaiian connection because a salmon poke appears as app-- in the earliest days they made a tuna poke which we still talk about in our family (we visit the islands regularly and there developed a loving taste for poke, basically the Hawaiian form of ceviche or tuna tartar)-- and, in the mains sector, there's now a luau! Well, of course knowing these guys the meats are expertly done with ribs, seared pork belly, and panko-crusted duck confit, but what I would draw your attention to is the way the taro mash is utterly authentic in the correct Hawaiian manner, and a fritter stuffed with cheese and mashed potato is out of this world delicious.  That alone would be a huge hit in any ordinary resto like Joeys. I was tempted to ask for a handful more-- perhaps they could be re-entered as an app?   Again this to me shows the professional experience of the chefs.  Why aren't they working for the United Nations instead of a small place on main street Markham, with their mastery of Hawaiian, Malaysian, Han Chinese, and Mexican cooking?  There's no justice in this world.  But at least our family has our little local favourite."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and both experiences were phenomenal! I tried the poke bowl as an appetizer, and it was not what I expected. I have tried authentic poke bowls before, and this bowl was very salty and lacked Hawaiian flavour. But the entres were fantastic! I tried the triple cheese deep fried dumplings and they had the perfect combination of cheese and sauce. My all-time favourite will have to be the Chicken and Waffles. They are not your ordinary plain waffles with fried chicken. The waffle is soft, and unique with a cinnamon taste. The chicken was very moist and flavourful and the batter was not too crispy. Best chicken and waffle I have ever tried. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was very classy and comfortable. A great place for dates or just a gathering with friends. The service was friendly, although it can be slow sometimes when the restaurant is packed. Once, we ordered the pulled pork fries and never got them, even after we finished our entre. But our server was very apologetic about his mistake. 

Overall, great place with great food. I highly recommend and will definitely be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I had to book this restaurant for a Saturday almost a week in advance. It's a small restaurant but the staff there are all really friendly. 

I researched the menu before I got there so I knew what I would be getting. The food was good; the mix of Asian fusion did work. I thought my duck confit fries were really tasty. The burger I ordered was pretty good too...except I had to use a knife and fork to eat it. 

All in all I would recommend this again for people and try something new for next time."}
{"text":"Food quality is excellent and service is impeccable. Fusion cooking is a flavorful experience. Also try their Sunday brunch...eggs benedict's and Korean beef has spoiled me...can't imagine a better brunch experience.
Les"}
{"text":"This was my first time here after hearing and seeing all the great things. 

We started off with the \"Extra Butter\" coconut shrimp. This was delicious, I would definitely recommend and re-order.

I had the Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad. It was very filling and coming from a Vietnamese background, this dish was very similar to the foods that my mother makes. The beef was nice and tender and cooked to perfection ( nice medium rare).

My boyfriend had the Japanese Squid Buffalo Burger. This was something different so we wanted to give it a try. This burger is exploding with a lot of bold flavours and finishes off with some lemongrass notes. If you are not a fan of lemongrass, then I would not suggest getting the burger. My boyfriend does not like lemongrass too much but he did not mind the burger. 

The service was great. Although there were only two servers, they made sure every table was attended to and got what they needed. 

I am already planning my next visit back here!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few times. Tried many of their dishes and lived them all.
For a lighter burger, my favorite is the Far East Burger, the beef was so tender and flavorful.
My favorite would be the Inspire Burger. The fried egg and patty and every thing about it is delicious!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Will definitely go back to try other items on the menu. The luau platter, INSP burger was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Good food, great and quick service. We went for lunch during a weekday and so it wasn't very busy. Nice and clean place. I thought menu was slightly overpriced for lunch menu but was defiantly worth it and so filling. Would come again! Highly recommend the squid burger if your a fan of seafood."}
{"text":"Within the first bite of my dish, I definitely understood why Inspire was rated so highly!

I made reservations for 8:30 on a Friday evening, and the restaurant was about 75% full. Tables are kind of limited so I could definitely see it filling up quickly. 

I ordered the udon carbonara ($19) which included spicy italian sausage, braised beef, mushrooms and a quail egg. This dish was absolutely amazing and I would highly recommend it!!

We also had the INSP burger ($16) which included grade primed beef, seared pork belly, fried egg and tomato mayo. While I usually don't prefer burgers, this burger definitely changed my perspective. I loved the addition of the runny egg and the pork belly just gave it that extra flavour kick! We decided to upgrade our side of fries to the duck confit fries for $4 and it was totally worth it. They don't skimp out on the duck!

The service was also excellent. The staff continuously checked up on us to make sure we were satisfied with our dishes, and filled our waters. 

I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes!

Atmosphere: 5/5 | Service: 5/5 | Price: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"5 stars for food! But don't expect to have dinner there without a month advance booking! Bit pricey but does offer some Japan fusion dishes which is quite rare in Markham. Restaurant seems to only have one waitress working who is the bartender/cashier/server/greeter! Nice cozy place to enjoy a drink and have some flavourful dishes."}
{"text":"Plating ok. Food ok. Decor, trying but not quite there. Overall, a 3.5/5.0 as it'll be the little details that take it higher. You can tell they're trying and the staff are nice, but just like the wallpaper in the bathroom, if they take a moment to ensure they line up it'll be perfect.

Had the INSP burger and as a signature dish, it should be perfect and piping hot. Unfortunately the egg was broken as served and spilled over the serving board, also soaking the bottom of the bun. Paying attention to the little details will turn this place into the gem it's trying hard to be."}
{"text":"I walked in after reading a review and I'm glad we stopped in, the food was delicious!! I can't wait to go back! Be sure to make a reservation as its a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had in my life which makes it more than a burger. Also the noodles were amazing."}
{"text":"We had made a reservation almost a week ago for Saturday night. We drove all the way from downtown to Markham to find out that they do not have our reservation in the book. We even showed the phone log to show we called on Tuesday to make the reservation. They refused to accommodate and denied us. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. I refuse to recommend this restaurant to anyone due to this kind of service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, each time it gets better and better. 

Despite only being open for a short while, the chef's clearly have a passion for their clientele and their product. The menu is consistently being tweaked and just seems to get better each time. 

Last I attended we were a party of 7, a good chance to try a few apps without getting too bloated for the entrees.

Apps:
- Ahi Tuna Poke - great item to share, cool presentation
- Duck Confit Tacos
- Pulled Pork Fries - a favorite of the table

Entrees:
- Inspire burger (added the pulled pork fries; this stuff is like crack)
- Udon Carbonera (Another favorite of the table, so good it should be illegal) 
- Chicken & Waffles 
- Malaysian Beef Curry w/ coconut rice

The food was absolutely sublime and the service was excellent. The decor was charming, both rustic and homely at the same time; the rough end cuts that make up the wall near the window are particularily charming, and the handtowels in the bathroom are a nice touch. Seems more like a place I would find in midtown or downtown, not on the east end near the suburbs. 

Give this place a try, even if its a bit of the drive for you; totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and portions, though the server wasn't very helpful. I ordered the veg hanoi (veggie salad) and it was full of flavours and textures. Easily the best salad I've ever eaten! Extra side of fries costed $4, and my family ordered their burgers and steak salad which also were amazing with presentation and taste."}
{"text":"Everything taste the same.......
After going  back and forth a few times they were finally open one day ' we waited by the door for about 10 minutes waiting for a table  \" the whole restaurant was empty \" but the guy and the girl who were there couldn't make up there mind were to sit us ' finally we got a table  and later we found out that the guy was the executive chef ' my 1st one in baseball cap ' we ordered a few different things and they all tasted the same and I never knew french fries was supposed to be limp not crisp ' $100 later was one of the worst meals I had ....I give it 2 stats because the waitress was great and the place was clean"}
{"text":"This place is a gem hidden away on main street markham. Google maps directed us to the wrong place, its just north of Wilson on main. The waiter was friendly, fast and incredibly helpful. The food was spectacular. We got the burger and steak salad. I've never had a salad so delicious in my life!!! Perfectly seasoned. We got the caged mousse Dessert was visually appealing and a good mix of crunchy and soft. Perfect."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised for a Markham restaurant. I have had my fair share of chicken and waffles from Harlem Restaurant, CNE to Pickle Barrel...etc, I would have to say this was the best chicken and waffle combo yet! 

For$12, the chicken was boneless, tender and crispy which was paired perfectly with the fluffy waffles. There was a small dollop of butter and the just the right amount of syrup. 
 
I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great place to check out! I got the cheesecake burger and I was excited but a bit scared too - turns out there was no need for that because it was amazing! perfect balance of sweet and savory. The cheesecake complimented the savory burger patty but didn't dominate it and it was a great palette cleanse to keep from the boring repetitive burger biting routine - each bite was a surprise and a burst of flavour. I will say, though, that the duck confit fries were not much different from your regular fries and I did not taste anything different. The rest of the meal was still great, the service was friendly/helpful and the ambience of the restaurant is lively. Not to mention, the amazing decor! Even took a picture of the chef and interacted with him. Great food, amazing friendly service, lively ambience - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"The hubby and I came here for date night as we saw so many rave reviews. 

We ordered to start: 
1) Pulled pork frites - The fries weren't particularly crispy and it didn't look like there was a lot of pulled pork.  The pork had good flavour overall but it wasn't astounding.  

2) Panko scotch egg - This dish was interesting.  To be honest, the taste and textures are difficult to describe.  I can't say it was bad nor can I say I loved it (and I'm a big fan of eggs).  

For entrees we had: 
1) Chicken and waffles - We didn't quite understand the point of the meringue kisses and left those uneaten.  We appreciated how the chicken was boneless and dark meat.  It was seasoned with 5 spice which added that \"Asian\" flavour to it.  The waffles were dense and lacklustre. 

2) Banana leaf salmon - The salmon was cooked well (not dry) and came with coconut rice.  I think perhaps the rice was cooked with coconut oil because it was quite oily.  In fact by the time you got to the end of the dish there was a pool of oil. 

The service was fantastic.  There was only one server who was friendly and came by often to refill our glasses with water. 

Overall, the food at Inspire was good but not great.  Not sure if I would come back.  It's certainly an Asian fusion restaurant and had very interesting combinations.  I wouldn't say I loved it but it was decent for the price."}
{"text":"I came to Inspire with HUGE expectations - in part due to the long waitlist to eat here, and also because of the other raving reviews I had read about. 

While the atmosphere and food is great, it definitely isn't as great as I had been expecting. I went with my entire family and we each tried different things (I had the Korean Sandwich). The meals were tasty and the service was very enjoyable, but I have had better fusion inspired food before.

This is definitely a great addition to the Markham food scene, especially for those who aren't interested in driving down to Toronto. Although there is nothing wrong with my experience, I think just expected more in terms of flavour and was a bit let down. Definitely worth checking out though!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for a birthday lunch and was impressed. Booked a reservation and was promptly seated after we stepped through the doors. We started with the \"Extra Butter\" drunken Crustaceans, my wife had the Inspire Loco Moco, and I had the Inspire Burger with Pulled Pork Fries. I was impressed with all of the food and the service. There only appeared to be one server for about six tables, but my glass of water was constantly refilled (never had to ask once), and the individual hand towels were definitely a nice touch. Food prices were reasonable and portion sizes were very good as I couldn't finish my fries (I'm a fairly big eater). Very eclectic atmosphere and the seating areas and bathrooms were very clean. Will definitely be back to try the Chicken and Waffles as well as the Udon Carbonara."}
{"text":"My mom and I got food poisoning after having brunch at this place. The food tastes pretty good. I guess it's the beef that is didn't cooked well."}
{"text":"I signed up right now just to write this review, because this is very poor service. Let me state that we had reserved the spot at 8:30pm. We came a bit early and waited which was fine. We didn't mind. 

It was my friends' birthday and came here to treat him based on the reviews.  The main reason we came here was for chicken waffles. They gave us the menu and we ordered beer. Started drinking. 10 minutes later they asked if we were ready to order. We said yes and then before we were about to order, she mentioned after we started drinking beer that they ran out of chicken waffles and fish and chips.....

We came here for chicken and waffles. They could've told us this before we started to buy our beer. Or even we were waiting outside in the cold weather. They could avoided this by letting customers know when they walk in. Or put up signs. This is ridiculous. We had to pay for beer. Did not apologize or compensate us for inconvenience  they have caused. I would never come back here again. 

This is the worse experience I ever had at a restaurant.  If I can give no stars, I would. Jeez."}
{"text":"The insp burger is out-of-this-world. It's a must have. I would definitely recommend making a reservation since the place is small and most tables are often reserved. The service was great and friend. The food was prepared quickly and the price is around $15 a burger, which is comparable to other gourmet burger joints."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with reservations as I was advised by friends. The place was packed and the service was amazing. I got the Udon carbonaro and my sister got the IST chicken burger. Every bite I had of the Udon was sooo flavourful and I usually avoid red meats. My sister said the IST burger was the best burger she had. I liked the portion size because it wasn't too overwhelming and we were able to finish our dishes. Def coming back to try their breakfast! highly recommended joint !"}
{"text":"Tried it out today and everything turned out great! Loved the asian fusion style dishes especially the chicken & waffles dish. Great service too."}
{"text":"I selected 1 star because it was the minimum. I cannot comment on the taste/quality of the food. I can only comment on the quality of service. I went to the restaurant with my family and we were greeted by an awkward stare for about a minute before being told that we would not be seated. We were well dressed and well mannered. The one thing that stood out was that we were coloured. We were simply told they could not seat us without a reservation despite having several available tables. We asked if they typically required a reservation. They responded not always but due to it being the weekend they would not be able to give us a table even if we came back 2-3 hours later. If you enjoy this place I'm glad you had a positive experience but based on the experience I had I will never return."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Wish the place was a bit bigger.  Not much more to say....taking up space so yelp doesnt tell me my review is too short"}
{"text":"We had real high expectations based on reviews. For our first visit, we had coconut shrimp (nice but too salty), chicken waffle  (expected chicken breast but it was dark meat) , and burger (ok). Overall,  food tasted good but could have been better. I felt it was overpriced. The best thing was great service."}
{"text":"Today was our second visit because I couldn't get the banana french toast bread out of my head from the firs time we were there. It is not every day you stand outside the door for a brunch place. Inspire has a great vibe and atmosphere for dinner or brunch. The food is simply delicious and crave worthy considering the price. If you are in the area this is an unpretentious yet stylish, good, and quick service with plenty to choose from. DO make a reservation before to get yourself a table.

I want to go there again next week.:) 

P.S: Duck Taco is really good. The meat is tender and the sauce is not overwhelming at all. Perfect size to be full without the feeling of overeating."}
{"text":"Went: 1:15 pm Sat May 9 2015
Ordered: INSP burger and an appetizer
Cost: incl. tax and tip $30-35
Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies.
The ambiance was different. I think the premise here is to have a changing menu of unique food combinations. Maybe it was our choices, but I don't recall being blown away by the food, even though what we had was very well done. For a a name like Inspire, I was hoping it would be more memorable.
Bottom line: Perhaps I had high expectations of uniqueness and quality, and those were not met. Still the food was very good and I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Love this place - a rare find in Markham. It's small and gets busy so reservations are always recommended. At dinner, I love their burgers and chicken & waffles. Brunch was good too but I prefer their dinner. Great service, everyone is really nice."}
{"text":"I won't bore everyone with an long review but keep it short and sweet! Amazing ambience, great service and delicious food! These three things come to mind when I think of Inspire Restaurant. Will definitely come back for more!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try if: A - you're really hungry, and B - you want to try some really mouth-gasm type  takes on classic comfort foods! Seriously! The chicken and waffles were INCREDIBLE! Pulled pork fries?? My gawd, the flavour! The house made ingredients, the quantities, all add up to a wonderful experience. Must try if you're in Markham. Always a line up so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come to this location for a while. I finally got in and was Very underwhelmed. 

Pros: 
Friendly staff.
They're straight up if they can't seat you. None of that come back in an hour stuff. 

Cons: 
The location is small.
Like very narrow. 

I tried the Chicken and waffles. 
I hated it BUT if you like dark meat pieces try it. 

If I go back(probably won't) I'm going to try the burger, I heard it was good."}
{"text":"First time coming here having the chicken and waffle it was great~! Second time around, a little birdy told me that the owners were on vacation for a bit and during that time we decided to go and try it again. The food was awful, inconsistent to the texture and the sweet and savory taste. We tried their Hawaiian platter or Luau Platter and the pork belly was dry and overcooked. What's going on Inspire? Should be Inspiring other restaurants with your art like food. :("}
{"text":"This is a great little place on Main Street Markham to eat. The dining room may be small but its only because they have amazing food and take great care of their customers that makes it such a treat.

The last time I was there I ordered the Hawaiian share plate and shared it with a friend. It was 30 dollars but it was so worth it. The ribs are something that should be only the menu on their own. They were fall of the bone and worth it.

The chicken and waffles are also very delicious with a combination of sweet and savory.

While the restaurant is on the expensive side it is worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! The portions and plating are beautifully done. When they say modern fusion, it is definitely next level! I would give them 6 stars if possible. One of our dishes took a bit longer, so they gave us an appetizer on the house. Also, the whole restaurant vibe and bathrooms are clean. Love this place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places to go when we have a date night. My boyfriend is in love with their maple chicken and waffles,  no where else will ever do if he has a craving for them. Having tasted them I'll admit their flavor profile is more advanced than your average chicken and waffles and they are really good, but my personal favorite is their salmon burger. I was expecting a dry salmon patty but the patty itself was amazing even if it came without anything on it. The toppings on it blew it out of the ball park for me. It was so good that it's hard for either of us to order anything else but I did coax myself into ordering something new last time and i got the duck taco which was just as amazing as the salmon burger. I firmly believe anything on their menu with taste amazing. Their service is excellent. They always fill our cups before they empty and are very attentive and accomodating. One of the best restaurants we've ever eaten at."}
{"text":"We discovered this amazing little gem a couple of years ago and have visited to on multiple occasions since. Their food never disappoint. They serve some creative fusion food but not pretentious. Portion is very substantial. Their chicken waffle dish has always impressed. One of our earlier visits, they had chili cheesecake, the hot spicy flavor balances the cheesecake richness so well. My only complaint is they are so busy, always have to plan ahead with reservation."}
{"text":"Someone throw me a rope because I was blown away with how satisfied I was with Inspire!!!

Located in the heart of Main St. Markham, Inspire was a stupendously delicious Asian fusion spot that my friends have come back to many times. This was my first time and it will definitely not be my last! 

We came here with a group of 7 and were accommodated promptly (made reservations). The servers were very kind and knowledgeable. Glasses were filled very often and I never had a time where my glass was empty. 5/5 for service.

I ordered the pulled pork fries as an app to share, as well as the Chicken version of the Inspire Burger (forgot the actual name). A couple of my other buddies had the Inspire Burger and they liked mean a lot more, I agreed with them. I also upgraded my fries to pulled pork fries for only $2!! (Double pulled pork fries I know, I live life like a king) 

The fries were so so so so good! The pork was super tender and the flavours were spot on. The mix of that mayo-Ish sauce was so good with the fries. The chicken inside the burger was super crunch and juicy. Each bite was a taste of heaven. The fresh veggies were also very pleasant and everything just worked really well together. Wonderful burger. I order burgers often and rarely do I get full, with this burger I was beyond full and I was so so so happy. 

If you're looking for good food, come. 5/5! 

P.S. The food is presented very well for all you picture manz."}
{"text":"I haven't a clue why this place gets such high ratings.  Maybe because it's in Markham, where it's food is unique to the area.  But the food is average at best.  The service is average.  They are overpriced and they nickel and dime you as much as possible.  You want extra mayo?  You will be charged.  They count newborns as part of the party, so the can auto gratuity you for 18%"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. The portion was huge ! It's surprisingly quiet on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Lunch is sooooo worth it (didn't enjoy coming for dinner maybe cause of the price factor)!  Burgers were done to perfection.  Don't forget to make reservations and go when the weather is warmer (cold air from front door definitely dampers the mood).  This restaurant is hidden but it's definitely a place to try at least once for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food! the flavours are off the hook! never ever expect a bland flavourless dish here! If you're looking for something to truly get the inspire, asian fusion flavours, be sure to try out one of their burgers. the waiting staff are also really friendly and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"This is a delayed post from about 3 months ago, but thought this was was worth writing about. 

First, the location is awesome. It's on Main Street markham, and really close to other bars and cute shops. 

We walked in without a reservation. We didn't wait long and feel we got lucky because the place filled up quick (around 7pm on a Friday). 

The staff was attentive and helpful to answer the bunch of questions we had on the menu. We ended up going with the the baos to start, the burger, pulled pork fries and the udon carbonara. The baos were not exactly what I had in mind - I was thinking of the steamed buns but the bread was more like a milk bun. Still delicious though!  The burger was awesome - cooked to about a medium with yummy pork belly and an egg on top. It's messy, but worth it. I wasn't as impressed with the pulled pork fries as some others were, simply because I like my fries crispy where these were on the soggier side because of all the sauces on it. The udon carbonara was awesome as well! A nice twist to a traditional dish. 

I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The food quality is very good. Interesting ideas on burgers and fries. Be wary almost all the items have a spicy zing to it so it adds flavour but may not be liked by children. Also, not many seats so reservations are a must."}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner on a weeknight, its better with more people so you can try more dishes! :) 

Starters:
Panko scotch egg -crispy and juicy pork on the outside separated with nori and an egg mmmm 

Pulled pork frites -yummy comfort food 

Hanoi chilled beef salad - nice tangy salad with vermicelli, the steak was nice and tender

Chicken & waffle- crispy chicken was juicy and salty and paired deliciously with the sweet waffle

Entrees:
The INSP Burger- tasty and flavorful, beef was juicy, fried egg was a nice twist to a burger and it came with a nice mountain of fries :p Mmmmm

Udon Carbonara- need to eat this daily, so creamy and tasty

Banana leaf salmon- coconut rice was light and sweet, salmon was fresh topped off with some veggies

Indonesian chicken Rendang- coconut curry with coconut rice and roti, curry was flavorful and thick

Dessert:
Caged chocolate mousse- beautifully presented, creamy and thick and not too sweet I like the added crunch of the sugar cage :p

Green tea mousse with coconut cream- another delicious dessert to complete our meal not too sweet nice flavors and textures mended well together 

Overall had a nice dining experience, service was friendly and fast, water was refilled regularly. Food was delicious and restaurant was nicely decorated. Will recommend to friends and family and will come again :)"}
{"text":"One of the places I've been dying to try and finally had to opportunity this weekend for a friend's birthday and it was pretty worth that (long) wait.  

\"Extra Butter\" Drunken Crustacean's - Beautiful presentation. Not too much flavour but just enough to start the meal off right. 4/5.

Pulled Pork Frites - Absolutely delicious.  Also a really good portion, that it's shareable or even large enough to be a main if you're feeling peckish. Not only were the fries nicely crisp, the sauce was very tasty and the pulled pork wasn't too saucy.  I'm sure when you hear \"pulled pork\" you'd automatically think \"bbq\"; this wasn't the case.  Had enough moisture to give it a nice flavour. I'd definitely get this again. 5/5.

Chicken & Waffle - Very generous portion and had a fusion of flavours.  One little concern I had was how some pieces of chicken seemed a little undercooked with it's colour BUT I'm still alive.  I'm guessing it was more from the brine.  The berries in the description were merely a couple of pieces (I wouldn't have bothered adding that to the description, to be honest).  I absolutely love the ginger maple butter, though.  Had just the right amount so it wasn't overpowering.  This was one item on their menu that I've been dying to try.  Was it satisfactory? Yes.  Would I order it again? If I had a hankering for C&W without having to drive downtown, yes.  4.5/5

Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad - Very generous portion that Elaine would be very happy (only Seinfeld fans would get that reference).  The beef was nice and tender; the dressing was light yet very refreshing.  5/5.

The INSP Burger - One of the best burgers I've ever tasted.  The patty was so incredibly juicy and had so much flavour.  If you like burgers, this is an absolute must-get.  I would go back for this any day. 5/5."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't posted a review earlier for Inspire, as it is my absolute fave restaurant in Markham. My husband and I are regulars at this restaurant - we still come back even though we do not reside in the area anymore. 

We've tried many of the items on the menu, from the Udon Carbonara, to the Indonesian Rendang, to the Matcha Cheesecake burger and none of them have failed to please. My husband highly recommends the Inspire Poulet Burger - this is his fave burger at Inspire. They are always coming up with innovative dishes and changing up the menu. So, even though they have removed some of my previous fave dishes from their menu, they always replace them with something just as (if not more!) delicious and creative. 

Service is consistently on the ball and friendly. We love chatting with the owner, Vanessa (same name, yay!) and the rest of the staff. 

This place is pretty popular though so reservations are highly recommended. 

So, if you're in Markham, get your butt over to Inspire!! You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious foods but can be tricky to get a table during popular times. call in advance to rsvp."}
{"text":"I found this place a bit overated. They have limited kinds of dishes. Food weren't that special. Service was okay. Too expensive I think"}
{"text":"This neat little place is located on Main Street Markham. Went there on a Sunday night with 2 other friends. Upon walking in, we were greeted by the waitress. It's a rather small restaurant. But the decor gave a very homey feel to it. 

They have the cutest menu ! We ordered the INSP loco moco, that sweet chick, and the waffed out. The loco moco was a small mountain on a plate ! Bottom up: coconut rice, angus beef patty, shrimp, shitake mushroom, topped with fried taro. The coconut rice was rich and creamy paired with the other ingredients. \"That sweet chick\" was a chicken burger served with fries, it definitely had the whoa factor when they brought it out on a small cutting board. Now behold, the WAFFED OUT! It's basically fried chicken with waffles and steak. What a wicked pairing ! The chicken was incredibly crispy, the blueberry waffles adds a hint of sweetness and bite to the chicken. The steak had great seasoning on it, it was super tender. 

The whole experience was great! Will definitely come back here to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Inspire is a pretty neat small little restaurant and has a cool atmosphere but I wasn't blown away by the food. It was extremely well put together and aesthetically pleasing but nothing delicious. Everything we ordered was fried (or a part of it was) and when we left the restaurant, we were all really oily from just being in there. We tried the lettuce wrap, pulled pork fries, INS burger, and thai meat balls. I probably wouldn't come back and I don't really recommend this place."}
{"text":"This mouth has tasted alot of burgers... But inspire is on point with there burgers! Inspire is my spot definitely when I got a burger craving! Also, I believe her name was geleena, she was one of the servers. She was great. We loved the team service aspect of our experience. The chefs... = A1.. If you don't know that meaning.. They are an inspired group of guys putting out quality Inspired food, and having fun and laughing while doing it! They stick to the name at the front door! Inspire got me Inspired!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you read the menu online and aren't already drooling over the descriptions, then you must not have a pulse. 

I came here with a couple of colleagues for lunch and it was a great experience. The restaurant is small, but stylish. And there's plenty of free parking, which I love. 

A colleague and I ordered the INSP burger and the chicken and waffles and split both meals. We both agreed that the burger was by far the better of the two choices. The patty was juicy and not overcooked. The runny egg was perfection. Everything about it worked harmoniously to create a succulent, tasty burger.

The chicken and waffles were good but they were a tad too sweet and syrupy for our preferences. If I order that dish again, I would probably request the syrup on the side.

Just a tip: My colleagues said the coffee was the worst restaurant coffee they've ever had. In fact, they said they'd rather drink our office coffee (which is not good). Inspire might want to get a better blend of coffee or a better coffeemaker or teach the kitchen staff how to make better coffee."}
{"text":"This hidden away restaurant on Main Street in Markham really surprised me!
They take reservations as well, which is good because it was packed.

The food was an interesting Asian twist to classic comfort foods.
I really liked creative and \"inspire\"d presentation of dishes!  

We couldn't resist the fried chicken and waffles with ginger maple sauce.
The chicken was juicy dark meat served on a fresh and heavy waffle.
You could really taste the ginger in the syrup which complimented the salty chicken nicely.

The pulled pork poutine was a good choice of appetizer!
The pork was fall apart tender with five-spice seasoning.

The seafood pasta was a huge portion!  There was lots of seafood, mussels, fresh shrimp, salmon, and the pasta was chewy and perfectly cooked.

The INSP burger looked impressive.

As for dessert, it wasn't bad but I will probably order something else next time.  
We had the chocolate tulips with pastry, custard, and fresh berries.

Overall, the service was attentive, the food was well...inspired.
This place is worth a visit if you live in the Markham area!"}
{"text":"Everything ordered was delicious, and presented well!  Came here with two friends and had oysters casino, duck taco, scotch egg, insp burger, udon carbonara and seafood paella and banana bread waffles for dessert.  Only took pictures of the burger and the dessert.  Killed off the appetizers then remembered.  Good service! would definitely come back here.  Can't really pick a favourite dish. I liked everything lol"}
{"text":"No so inspired by the lunch.

i had high hopes for this restaurant before I go. I went there for lunch at a 2 degree day. It's a small restaurant with only 1 set of door, the cold draft is very unpleasant when there were people enter or leave the restaurant. 

They had 1 server for lunch hour, who does not seem too unenthusiastic, and service is on the slow side for sure 

I should have looked that the yelp pictures before. Burgers and pull pork fries were drown in Mayo and way too sweet to my taste. 

After I paid, I got short changed at the end. The waitress gave me a care free \"OK\" and the change.."}
{"text":"Must have: udon carbonara and duck taco
Both exceeded expectations

Fried crab was okay
Would not order it next time

Service was attentive and the environment was decent. Good spot for a date."}
{"text":"The pros:  Inspire is a cozy little mid-priced spot that would be a good pick for a date.  Food is OK, can be a bit small in the appetizer portions but over-all still decent.  

The cons: You can basically never get a seat unless you've made reservations a couple weeks in advance - we once tried to walk-in for a table of 4 and was promptly turned away at the door, being told \"We don't even have seats at the bar today.  If you don't have reservations today, you won't get in. Don't bother waiting.\"  (Erm, I found this a little abrupt - no \"Sorry, we're fully booked out for the night\"?).  The thing is, I think the major reason of popularity of Inspire is that there's not much competition of the same food type/ambiance in the area.  The food's OK, but it's not *amazing* imho, and the prices are similar to what you'd pay for downtown."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Chicken and Waffles, INSP Burger, Udon Carbonara, Pork Carnita Tacos, Duck Taco, Pulled Pork Frites  

|| Rating: (10/10) Food (10/10) Service (9/10) Value (9/10) Ambience (10/10) Presentation ( 10/10) Cleanliness

|| My Experience:  

Each experience has somehow managed to best the previous outing to Inspire. What is great about this restaurant is it's continual desire to innovate and improve. Keep some key staples in the menu (outlined above), the restaurant steers away from daily specials, option to have the menu rotates frequently. 

For brunch, the fusion Eggs Bennie (with Pork Belly and chili hollandaise sauce) and Peking Corn Pancakes are my two favourites. The menu is a tad smaller, but manages to find something right for everyone in the table. 

For dinner, Chicken and Waffles, INSP Burger and Udon Carbonara are the de facto staples of this establishment, with the tacos and pulled pork frites rounding off the menu. At the time of writing this review, I would recommend the Salmon Poke Puchka and Flower Octopus as appetizers. For the Burgers I would suggest the Pork Belly, Korean or Far East Burgers, as they are a twist on the traditional burger dishes. 

Aside from the delicious consistent dishes, another standout part of Inspire is the service. Extremely attentive, friendly and helpful, I would rate their servers as one of the best I've ever had. Authentic and hard working, they're the real heroes that easily add an extra star to my rating. 

With amazing food and quality service, there's no wonder why Inspire is almost always a packed house. Plan ahead and make those reservations or you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I got the inspire burger and duck fries. A really chill environment for family and friends! Might sound silly but I loved how their water had cucumbers and lemon in it. Makes me feel like they pay attention to details."}
{"text":"I had the Waff Out Loud and it was so good I want to eat it all over again right after eating it all. The portion when it was first taken out seemed small but halfway through I almost wanted to tap out. 

It was so yummy! the service is really friendly and we had asked for recommendations. James (our server) asked about our preferences before making his recommendations. And boy was he right! 

I think based on the food and experience you're getting the price is reasonable. 

Really great experience, get a reservation."}
{"text":"This place was very cozy and quaint. Enjoyed the set up. I got the coconut salmon and was in love with it. My bf got the steak. It was pricey for what it was so I would recommend NOT to get a steak there (go to a steakhouse for that) but overall experience was great! Can't wait to try their other food"}
{"text":"Visited for brunch on the weekend. Tried the Inspire burger and it was amazing! Highly recommend it and well worth the price. Minus one star because we had brought our baby who decided to do a number 2, and when we took him to the washroom realized there was no changing station. We had to change his diaper on the floor. The restaurant is also quite small, so I wouldn't recommend bringing a stroller either."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Clean. Service is prompt. Prices are fair. Can't go wrong here. And did I mention the food is fantastic?"}
{"text":"EVERY item I ordered here was AMAZING. 
Yes it is a little pricey for brunch but my husband and I both thought it was well worth it!
We had Chicken & Waffle, Korean Steak Bennies, The INSP Burger,  \"Extra Butter\" Drunken Crustacean's. I just simply cannot pick a favorite because everything is amazing and flavorful especially Drunken Crustacean's. I love the lemon grass and garlic sauce, we wouldn't let the waitress take the plate away because it was soo good we had to scoop up all the sauce and put it in the fries! 

The Pull Pork fries is def to die for, and you can add money to get that with your burger!
Overall the meal was GREAT and will def come back to try dinner for special occasion. Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Inspire is such a pleasant surprise!  You will find Inspire with a little dark entrance along Main St.which isn't initially eye-catching.  There is parking along the street as well as in the back of the little plaza.  

The restaurant is quite small - probably about 15 tables.  A reservation is recommended even for small parties as they can get busy, and particularly if you have a larger party.  The restaurant is well decorated with warm colours and very comfortable.  

Regarding the menu - it's not extensive, but boy, all of them sound very delicious. We had a burger with duck confit fries and coconut curry meatballs on rice.  I was hesitant because I normally don't particularly crave for rice, but this was very, very savory.  The dish comes pretty compact in a little ball so you don't feel like it's a lot of food, but once you start digging in, it never ends.  The sauce is done just right so the rice is neither too dry or too saucy.  The meatballs are really juicy, and there are little octopus pieces throughout. Just when I thought it can't get any better, I tried some of the duck confit fries, and it's amazing!

It is now one of my favourites in the Markham area and I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I was over hyped about the chicken and waffles after seeing some of the delicious photos but after tasting the food it didn't live up to the expectations.

I ordered the duck taco appetizer which was a good fusion of western and eastern foods. I enjoyed the taco but just wish the duck was warmed up before being placed on the dish.

For the main course I got, what I mentioned above, the chicken and waffles. At first sight, I was felt pretty good about the way the dish was plated. It looked pretty just like the photos. The fried chicken was the main selling part of this dish, it was seasoned, juicy and crispy. The chicken is seasoned with a bit of ginger which I think elevated the taste of the heavy dish. 

But the waffles was a huge disappointment to me. It was soggy and had this weird texture to it. It tasted like something too healthy to be together with the awesome tasting fried chicken. The syrup for the waffles tastes good too.

If they can fix the waffles then this will be a five star dish."}
{"text":"Bookmark complete. After saving this spot for a very long while I have finally checked it off.

I am not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants but this one is an exception. The dish I ordered was the Korean steak bennies and the chicken and waffles. 

We came for brunch and made reservations for 1130 (opening time) the night beforehand. It went pretty smooth. Our table was prepared and the wait staff were excellent. Always very attentive and polite. 

The only reason I did not give the full 5 stars as there is a nasty draft that comes in every time someone opens the front door. It was quite cold and we were pretty deep into the restaurant so i m pretty sure everyone felt the same way in there. 

Storm door perhaps? 

Anyways it was quite a pleasant experience overall.

TIP: the place is very family friendly! Every table had babies when we were there lol."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch spot!

Food: 4/5 Prepared well. Interesting mix of items.
Service: 3/5 Okay but not very attentive.
Environment: 3/5Modern but cluttered. (Milage may vary)
Washrooms: 4/5 Okay.
Worth it?: 4/5 Pricy but okay for brunch.

Top top: Make a reservation. This place is very popular for weekend brunch.

I tried their brunch burger. It comes with a friend egg to remind you it's a brunch burger not just bar food.  I wish it came with crunch fried onions but maybe I'm asking for too much. Lol

I will sure to be back to try the chicken and waffles. I find few places do it well but it certainly looks very good."}
{"text":"Adding a few new photos from tonight's yummy dinner!

The Udon Cabonara is always great, a very hearty and filling dish.  It comes with a raw egg so make sure you mix it well! 

The Loco Moco dish was yummy and unique.  Sweet coconut rice paired with a hamburger steak, shitake mushrooms, tiger shrimp, and my favourite taro crisps! 

Wish we had room for dessert tonight, but we were way too full from dinner. 

Only suggestion would be to incorporate more veggies into the dishes."}
{"text":"Inspire has gotten better since the first time I tried them a few years ago.

I ordered the Salmon corn pancakes cheese scrambler
(Maple glazed charred jalapeno filled pancakes + spiced pork belly, aged cheddar, scrambled eggs, torched salmon and tobiko $19) and it was delicious! My friends really enjoyed their meal as well. The restaurant is a little small/cramped so be sure to make reservations when going with a larger group. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Yum! I was pleasantly surprised! The service was great here!! Make sure you make a reservation first, especially for the weekends, because I was turned down on a Friday night since they were fully booked until 9pm. Their menu is pretty good. I ended up getting the INSP burger that had pork belly, a beef burger and fried egg. It was really good! There was deep fried onion slices (they were very thinly sliced) inside that added a very nice crunch to the burger. I also opted for the more expensive duck confit fries for an extra $4. The spicy mayo sauce on the fries was good, but the duck was a bit too salty for me. The portion was really big, so whatever food you have left they allow you to take it back home. I was too full for dessert, so I'm probably going  to come back for their dessert! Overall there is a nice presentation of the food and I love their cucumber and carrot infused water! It was decently priced, the bill came up to $26 including a 15% tip."}
{"text":"Wow!!  What a surprise. This is the kind of place you expect to find downtown.   Asian fusion with a super inventive twist. I  am so happy to see great chefs taking up residence in the burbs. 

We started with the duck confit fries with kamichi sauce.   Was very nice , good size portion. Great for two . 

For a main I hade the udon carbonara.  Being Italian this is a dish I grew up on and was curious to try it. Well, let me tell you it was amazing. It was carbonara but different. The noodles played well against the creamy sauce the braised beef added some substance and the  underlying spiciness added kick. Oh yea.. Did I tell you it was spicy!!!

To end things off I had the green tea cheese cake. Again a wonder mix of unexpected flavours: sweet and spicy, that worked amazingly well together. 

All in all, a great place with a super inventive menu, great ambiance and free parking. Take that Toronto!! 

If you are into trying new things, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Very good food. I didn't make reservation but ordered take out. It taste amazing ! Their menu change all the time. It's really worth going"}
{"text":"Awesome find in Markham! Picture this- food from France married food from Asia and had a baby. Yea, it's as good as it sounds. Everything we've tried we loved. You honestly can't go wrong with whatever you order. One of my favourites is the Peach Coconut Curry meatballs and octopus on coconut rice. It has so many different flavours (including peanut sauce) that work surprisingly well together. Another favourite is the Chicken and Waffles. If you're going for brunch, they'll add a scrumptious egg on top! This place is the definition of fusion!

Dinner reservations are a bit hard to get unless you're okay with a 9:30-10pm slot. Reserve ahead! Brunch is much easier to book, even if it's the morning of. I'm assuming they just started doing brunch and not many know yet. Cuz I can't imagine why this place isn't a popular brunch spot (hope I haven't jinxed it)."}
{"text":"Its really no wonder why this restaurant has such high rating... Everything from start to finish was superb. 

I called at 6:30 pm for a reservations, the guy who answered said they were fully booked and I inquired about walkins and he was honest and advised it was a small restaurant but there might be something available around 9:30. So he took my name and number. Around 8:30 he called back to say someone canceled and there's a table reserved for us. I know to some this might not seem like a big deal, but quite often the person on the other end of the phone lacks customer service. 

We got there, ample parking in the back. Its easy to miss amongst all the other businesses on main street but a simple u-turn solves that issue.

The food... My oh my...

I got the udon carbonara. Creamy and delicious. Lots of mushrooms and sausage. Plus beef. It came with an egg. It arrived at the table steaming hot, but i really couldn't wait. It smelt so good, I had to dig in. A few burns later, some mishaps of noodles on my face. It was a large portion and I'm still stuffed 3 hours later. 

Dave got  the INSP burger. The burger was cooked to medium. Fried egg on top and what to me sets it apart from the rest, the pork belly. He ordered it with a side of duck confit frites. Everything was served on a wooden board. I asked him for his review, he said really good. 
During dinner we planned our next visit, so that means we really did enjoy the food.

The bill came to $50 including tax and tip.  It bad for low key, don't want to go Downtown kinda Saturday night."}
{"text":"This cozy little restaurant is situated on Main Street Markham.  It's a nice area to visit if never been.  We came here for mother's day and only found out about this place on Yelp.  It did not disappoint!  I can't really describe what kind of food they serve...I guess it's a mix of Asian, Italian, Indian and and American comfort?  What ever it was, it was delicious.  The chicken and waffles was savoury and sweet. The chicken was crispy and not dry.  The syrup had a kick of ginger...I think.  The pulled pork waffle pizza was interesting.  We didn't know how that was going to turn out, but once again the taste worked.  The pulled pork was a little dry though.  One thing I wish they did, was indicate on the menu that the food had a little spicy kick to it.  Not that I can't handle the spiciness, but my niece didn't like it too much.  If we knew there was a kick to it, then we may have ordered other food for them.  We also had the udon with italian sausage.  The sauce was like a cream sauce mixed with mushrooms.  Maybe a tad too much sauce.  I never had udon noodles like that but it was great!  The sauce also had a hint of spiciness to it.  Overall, we had a very good experience and the food was delicious.  A friendly staff and a nice location made it even better."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant when I came here because one of my best friends highly recommended it as one of her favourite restaurants.  However, I didn't really like it. 

We had the chicken and waffles, and the butter chicken pasta. The chicken was not as crispy as I would have liked it and the waffles were a little soggy and underdone. The butter chicken pasta was just not as good as I had hoped either."}
{"text":"Loved the udon carbonara I had for dinner here with my gf, so I was really excited to try out their brunch (my favourite meal of the day obviouslyyyyyy)!! I ordered the Eggs Bennies which had two soft poached eggs, spiced pulled pork belly with a chilli tamarind hollandaise sauce on a garlic buttered toast. The eggs were perfectly cooked, but I found the hollandaise sauce to be a tad too sour. I love sour foods, and I love tamarind in my Vietnamese sour soup, but the amount of tamarind flavour was actually too much for the delicate dish. The pork belly underneath was also really hard and sorta over cooked. I was really disappointed in this dish...

The FHubs will always order waffles for brunch if it's on the menu. So obviously he would go for the waffles  
Death by Waffles & Co has aged cheddar cooked inside the waffles, pulled pork, braised beef, berry compote and a fried sunny side egg on top. 
He felt like they should have stuck with just the pulled pork instead of having both beef AND pork. There were a lot of layers of flavours going on but they weren't blending together very well. The aged cheddar on the waffle was a bit much and felt more like a filler than a compliment to the dish, also the cheese was cold and made the waffle a little bit too chewy. Overall the dish was ok, surprisingly the berry compote really pulled the dish together but unfortunately there was very little of it. He wished there was more of the compote on the dish. 

I feel like the restaurant food quality has gone down since the first time I've been there...I hope they don't change anything else, because I loved their dinner me"}
{"text":"Really good restaurant, get the chicken and waffles or the insp burger! The downside is that for someone who doesnt like seafood i have limited options, the portion size is also really great which is not necessarily a bad thing but you're going to want to eat a light lunch before heading here for dinner.

p.s. i really like their fries"}
{"text":"Where did this place come from? Nestled in quaint Markham main street this Asian fusion place has a feel that belongs downtown. A limited menu but all  big on taste. I had the far east burger and duck frit fries. Delicious. Haven't tasted this fusion flavor outside of a trip downtown. Fairly priced and convenient for those in the suburbs I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went there for the chicken and waffles to see what the hype was. It was really good but in my opinion I didn't enjoy the finer syrup as much. My boyfriend had the INS burger and THAT was really good. Great food and good service :) definitely want to come back to try their other features."}
{"text":"Yummy food in my tummy! Udon carbonara is so good. Next time I will try the chicken and waffles :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times before, the service isn't always consistent, but overall it's not too bad. The food is absolutely delicious (which is the reason why I come here often to dine). I always order the udon carbonara - it's really creamy and the flavour tastes right. I find it cool how we mix the quail egg with the pasta! The INSP burger is really flavourful and the egg inside the burger always tastes perfect with the burger. The fries are just any regular fries, but you can always switch it to something else. I would say that this is a nice place to take your date out for dinner - just remember to make reservations beforehand because it gets packed!"}
{"text":"I'm late to the hype of Inspire, my friends have been frequenting the place for years without me! I came in with high expectations and was not disappointed at all by their brunch menu. Typically I am partial to Asian fusion because it feels like Canadian/American food with some stereotypical Asian feature thrown in, fortunately Inspire's creativity allows them to blend the two cultures together in a complementary way. I consider their food to be more Canadian than Asian, but one can see the influences in flavour profile and ingredients quickly. Good to note is that the quality and quantity I felt was worth the price paid.

The meal kicked off well with their refreshing mint, cucumber, and carrot infused water - a unique combination that wasn't excessively flavourful but offered something special.

My Death by Waffles was just that - flavourful and moist pulled pork, and authentic tasting coconut curry chicken, a sweet berry compote sitting on top two perfect sunny/over-medium eggs and melted cheese, and a soft fluffy waffle that acted as a velvet cushion and sponge to all the flavours. The dish came deceivingly small, as a chowed in it was endless and satisfying to the last bite. If I had to complain, it'd be that the dish was on the heavy side and didn't wake me up as I sometimes expect my breakfast to do. If I could change one thing, it would've been to have the option to choose either pulled pork or curry chicken (or half and half I guess) - getting both eliminates having to choose but the portion more than satisfies and everything was happening all at once with all the flavours to the point I couldn't differentiate them near the end. I guess the name Death by Waffles was fitting for that reason.

My friends and I were there for birthday celebrations and when the waiter heard he warmly urged us to stay despite they were closed up for the afternoon before dinner rush. Out came a highly stacked ice cream waffle sandwich - topped with banana purée(?) and the ice cream thoroughly blended with crushed pecans and other nuts. It was a funky monkey ice cream waffle sandwich if I ever had one! I hope it's something I can order again, because that alone was worth five stars."}
{"text":"These pictures come from my fifth visit to the restaurant. I would give this restaurant a 5/5 for their the INSP burger alone. AMAZING. By far, one of the best burgers that I have ever had in Toronto - actually in all of Ontario. It is succulent, juicy, it is cooked PERFECTLY. It is leaking with juices when you eat it and it combines wonderfully into your mouth. It's juicy but not overly greasy. 10/10. Come get the burger. 

The other dishes that I've tried: udon carbonara, chicken and waffles, duck confit fries. The things that I've tried that dont' seem to be on the menu on their site: salmon poke bowl; korean breakfast pork belly hash type of dish; breakfast burrito; red velvet ball dessert. 

I would say of all their other dishes that I've tried, they're okay. The breakfast burrito was BOMB diggity as well, the flavours were fused together beautifully but I haven't run into it since. All the other dishes are okay, they're definitely not bad, but they're definitely not homeruns either. It's like they're all close to getting amazing but all missing something as well. They dont' fuse together amazingly. 

Make sure you call in or e-mail ahead of time to make reservations as it's a small space and they get quite busy. Their service is also great! The people there are very friendly, very easy to get along with and care about whether or not you have a great dining experience.

Definitely go. Definitely get the burger."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5. Inspire is a the type of restaurant that I would see downtown and wish that it existed in the GTA. Well Inspire was my dream come true offering excellent and creative asian fusion dishes at reasonable prices given their prime location at Markham main street. I came with a group for lunch and I ordered the far east burger and upgraded to duck confit fries. The burger was cooked to medium (waitress was kind enough to let me know in case I didn't like my meat pink) and came with pineapple mango mayo. I always loved the combo of sweet and salty and this burger was not exception. I did wish that the mango in the mayo would stick out more though. Also duck confit fries leaned a bit on the salty side but was good nonetheless. 

I also mooched off of my mom's chicken and waffles and it was delicious! Chicken was crispy on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. Waffle was well made and the ginger maple just brought the whole dish together. Glad to have found a good chicken and waffles joint up in the burbs. Will definitely return for lunch and possibly dinner too if I feel like treating myself to a great meal!"}
{"text":"Would rate this place a 3.5 if possible. I was really excited to go here, so we made a reservation the day before for Saturday. We got there at around 11:45 am and most of the tables were already taken. The restaurant is trendy and clean inside. We ordered the pulled pork frites to start, Korean steak bennies and chicken and waffles. 

The fries were delicious! However, the mains were both just okay and we both felt sick after. Service was decent. We were checked up on a lot and our waters were refilled quickly. The only thing was our wait for our food was long and the food did not live up to the hype. 

Overall, for our meal, including tip, it was around $50 and we both left.. Uninspired."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion. Love the environment, the services and the food. Udon carbonara is the bomb. Shredded Pork fries must try..."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday, 

 Well... its not as good as i thought it would be. I probably won't be back. 

The fried chicken wasn't my liking it had too many different  flavors  going on and just tasted gross. The waffle also had a weird taste like curry, sweet butter, mixed with some other spices that didn't taste great. 

The burger on the other hand was good, very juicy and perfectly flavored. The fries were meh, they were decent cause of the sauce. 

Service was so-so. Waitress doesn't look very happy. 

Price is: $30 for 2"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of all the 5-star reviews, but boy was I wrong!

As someone else mentioned, the uninspiring exterior belies a pretty fantastic little restaurant. I kind of figured this would be another \"fusion\" restaurant that's doesn't really do much in the way of fusing anything and just serves dishes from more than one cuisine. But this menu is really ambitious, and I already want to return and try more dishes.

First of all, it's a narrow space in a plaza on Main Street Markham that was vacant for a while. Thankfully, this plaza seems to be doing much better these days, and I hope this means more restaurants will continue opening along Main. 

The room was packed, which is always a good sign when a restaurant has only been open a few months. The staff were very friendly as we waited at the bar for a table. They have Sapporo on tap and a few decent domestic beer options in bottles. They also prepare some tasty cocktails. We had a starter while we waited, the pulled pork frites. These were amazing! It had aioli on top, which really added to the dish.

The first item on the entre list was pulled pork waffles and I knew I had to try them. This was not something I expected at all from a restaurant with Chinese characters on its sign. I've had fired chicken waffles before (this restaurant also has that on the menu), but I was hungry for more pulled pork at that point after the starter. And, well, it was as delicious as it sounds. In addition to the obvious two main ingredients, it also has apple chutney and honey. I'd be very tempted to try this again, even though I want to explore the rest of the menu.

Excellent food and service! This is another win for main street."}
{"text":"I've heard quite a bit about Inspire since it opened and I finally gave it a try a few weeks ago for brunch on a Saturday.

The place is quite small and the private lot entrance was relatively hard to find. I missed the entrance twice because of the heavy traffic on Markham Road! 

We ordered the pulled pork frites to share. This was definitely a good start to our meal and it left us satisfied without feeling too heavy or greasy.

My friends ordered the chicken & waffle and the eggs bennies. The portions were just enough to fill you up for brunch/lunch! Both my friends enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the INSP Burger which was quite good and not as messy as I imagined. The egg was cooked just enough so the yolk wouldn't go everywhere when I broke into it. The burger came with a side of fries with their special mayo. I was so full that I took half my burger home! 

I am quite intrigued by their udon carbonara that is offered during dinner so I will definitely be back to try that!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Highly recommend the Inspire burger and Chicken and waffles. Price is very reasonable. Make sure you make reservations on weekends!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My go to place when I am craving American comfort food. Love that the menu is Asian inspired.  If you are planning on eating here, you must reserve a table. I've seen customers get turned away because they didn't make a reservation. 

The Chicken and waffles is a must try but it is heavy, so it is better to share. The chicken has a nice bold flavour of Chinese spices and hints of ginger.

The salmon burger was delicious, but it was an oily mess! The bread absorbed all the oil and the toppings were slowly sliding off after each bite, so I ended up eating the toppings and patty near the end.

Also, if you come here on certain special days like Valentine's day, they will mostly likely have a set menu you can choose from. Visited this place for the first time on Valentine's day and I was looking forward to trying the Chicken and waffles but it wasn't on their menu."}
{"text":"Finally got to fulfill my cravings! Met up with one of my friends visiting from England and selfishly chose Inspire so I could have chicken and waffles. After reading reviews online, I thought it was going to be packed but it was dead. I had made a reservation but it apparently wasn't necessary. However it was one o' clock on a Tuesday so that probably explains it. 

I already knew what I wanted and my friend had to take some time. The lunch menu I find doesn't have the most diverse selections but it does have a good amount of burger options. He got the far west burger. His burger came with a salad and he loved it all. He doesn't always eat meat but he said it's one of the best burgers he has ever had. He loved the fried pickles inside and said the meat was cooked very well. Apparently it's Angus beef which is the good stuff. 

My chicken and waffles were very well sized. It was really delicious! The chicken was perfectly spiced and crispy. The syrup they use was a bit on the sweeter side and a bit drenched so it made the waffles kind of soggy but regardless it was still very tasty. Next time i would just ask them to put it on the side. 

The service was really nice and friendly, and they didn't rush us to head out even though we were finished for awhile. I would come back and try their dinner menu for more options."}
{"text":"TL;DR The BEST Asian fusion/friendly menu created by the best chefs in town. You get burgers to console your unadventurous bland white/washed friends that are created beautifully and the rest is a ride. Whether you're from Vietnam to the Philippines they have it all. As well as perfect cocktails and non-alcoholics.

CREDIT CARD #s FOR **OVER THE PHONE RSVP**
A fair warning to people who reserve over 6 ppl you have to put your credit card number down because it is a fairly small restaurant. DO NOT LET THAT DISSUADE YOU FROM COMING HOWEVER because you can come in person put down a tiny cash deposit of 10 or smt and they'll give it back once you guys show up.

Service (5/5)
Why? Because the server will always refill your glass before you even think about asking them to BUT you were about to ;) They have great recommendations and describe the dishes with great endeavors to push and shove you in the right direction for what you're feeling tonight. Thank you so much for always having me and my friends come.

Atmosphere (5/5)
Music isn't too loud, people aren't too loud, dimly lit, decor is fitting (imo my friends say otherwise), bougie but caual bougie. You don't have to wear a suit and can opt for sweats and sneaks but if you do you still fit right in. All are welcome!

Food (69/6)
Listen to the orgasmic sounds these photo's I've taken create. The symphony of flavours ranges from old style country to remind you of your roots to bold flares of contemporary hip hop to suit mainstream trends and up above just simply harmonc heavenly strings being pulled by the chefs themselves.

Must Try Recommendations: 

Food:
Udon Carbonara for a creamy comfort.
Octopus Curry with Blueberries for the adventurous, you won't be disappointed.
Chicken & Waffles for all you basic people out there ;)
Loco Moco for people feeling homesick.
The Duck Fries for sharing.

Drinks:
All of the cocktails are to die for and they're not all 18+$ like literally every bougie restaurant has. My personal favourite is the Fashion Killah because bourbon and whiskey are my two best friendsssshhhhh it's a secret.

If you'd like non-alcoholic their tahiti fruit punch is apparently EVERYONES go to even though you can clearly tell it's just carbonated fruit jus (its not me though but they do recommend it) but carbonated fruit jus that is ALWAYS SOLD OUT past like 6 or 7 pm. Besides that I love the Mango Berry drink give it a go if you're not a carbonic acid fan :)

Thank you again for having me and I hope to come again for the new dishes created and being created since I've been last!"}
{"text":"Delicious place for brunch! Reservations are recommended but not necessary - you may get lucky. We came for a birthday celebration and enjoyed a delicious meal.  With a huge assortment of food to choose from, it was really hard to hone into one choice. Luckily, we all chose something different so we could try many of the brunch dishes. My favourite by far was the salmon burger. The chicken and waffles also looked super yummy and filling. 

Overall a great place with friends and dates!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic fusion restaurant. It's not too spacious but they take reservations, so do try to book in advance. I've heard from a couple of friends that have wanted to try this place out that they haven't been able to make it cause it was always busy or the tables were already reserved. I sent them an email the day before and was able to reserve a table for two on a Friday afternoon for brunch. After we were seated, we saw people leaving as the wait time was too long so reservations are key for this place. 

I personally thought that the customer service was excellent. We were served quickly when we arrived and I had no issues with making the reservation beforehand (sent an email and received a reply back right away). 

The choices on their menu are so unique, I wanted to get everything! Some previous reviews have stated that their INSP burger is a must get. We ended up ordering the Korean Steak Bennies (Grade Prime Strip Steak + Soft Poached Eggs + Butter Garlic Toast + Chessy Soy Bechamel + Turmeric Seasoned Fries + Shallot Aioli) for $18: WORTH IT, and the Salmon Corn Pancakes Cheese Scrambler (Maple Glazed Charred Jalapenos filled Pancakes + Spiced Pork Belly + Aged Cheddar + Scrambled Egg + Torched Salmon + Tobiko) $18; DELICIOUS. Of the two, I would definitely recommend their Steak Benny!"}
{"text":"Man, with mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect going in. I was definitely blown away though! The food was very delicious!

Walked in and told them I had a reservation, but something went wrong, as they didn't seem to be able to find me name. We still got a table, and took a look at the menu. The lunch/brunch menu were quite limiting in terms of main courses, but there were many sandwich options. We ordered some drinks first, and got some Pomme Cider and a Sapporo (on tap). Amazing cider, definitely worth trying. 

For lunch, we ordered the Korean, INSP Burger, Chicken & Waffles, and Butter Chicken Serpentini. Each one was amazing, and definitely worth mentioning.
My cousin said the Korean sandwich was amazing, and was literally raving about it hours after! Delicious cuts of beef on a French baguette. 
The INSP Burger was amazing as well, with 2 cuts of meat and an egg, it was messy, but delicious.
Chicken & Waffles were amazing, and glad they made it with dark meat! 
Lastly, the Butter Chicken Serpentini was flavourful and light. With all the full flavour of a butter chicken, but beautiful adapted into a pasta!

Service was quite good, and quick despite only having 2 servers working. They both checked up on our table and were friendly. 

I would highly recommend trying this place out, but also recommend making a reservation. Seemed quite busy throughout the lunch hour."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here, it was such a great place! 

I had the Death by Waffle, it was waffle with aged cheese, topped with curry chicken, pulled pork, poached eggs and blueberry jam. I was worried about this combo of mix, but turned out that it tasted so good! The waffle was fluffy, with the cheese melted in, plus the savory chicken and well-marinated pork, and the jam's sweetness brought the whole thing to the next level. Overall it was amazing.

My friend had eggs benedict. Instead of using English muffins and bacons, they used garlic toasts as base and pork belly for the meat part, made the dish much more special. They put curry into the potatoes too, very creative.

Apart from the food, the decor was special too, and the service was great. Will definitely go for a second round soon!"}
{"text":"Found this gem after visiting a farm in the area. I had the eggs benedict, which was so delicious and my husband had the chicken and waffles, which was amazing as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles were delicious!! Just the perfect amount if sweet, spicy and crispy.  I only wish I had enough room for dessert! I will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"Inspire Restaurant is one of the few fushion restaurants that make the food right. My friend and I tried two dishes from Inspire and they were both done perfectly.

This location is rather hidden, but it is part of the big 144 Main Street complex. It is located at the far north end of the complex. The restaurant requires reservation in advance. However, when we arrived the restaurant early, there were many empty seats. This may tell you that reservation is sometimes not required.

The two dishes that we ordered were the udon carbonara, and the chicken waffle. I think these two dishes are the specialty signature dish of Inspire Restaurant. Though the selection on the menu was very limited, it may signify that the restaurant focusing on perfecting the dish that they serve.

Udon Carbonara: Creamy dish that normally go along with pasta, but with udon instead at Inspire. This dish has spicy Italian sausage, and braised beef honey mushroom. I'm quite happy with this dish because the portion is decent, and the udon blends very well with the Italian sausage. Not to mention that there is also alfalfa sprout on the side which makes the dish very presentable.

Chicken Waffle: The chicken waffle dish is also made well, if not, showcasing an even bigger contrast between western and asian food. The chicken and the waffle are presented side by side on the dish (not stacked together like a burger). You're supposed to eat a piece of the chicken and waffle together. When I tried it, the taste is very distinct where the sweetness from the waffle comes out first, and then quickly died and overshadowed by the strong salty taste from the chicken. No matter whether you put the chicken or waffle on top, the taste result is the same. This can be due to the fact that sweetness is detected at the tip of our tongue in our tongue map. 

I definitely recommend this place if you are up for an adventure to try fushion style cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is still pretty good, but it feels a bit like they are struggling to keep up with their capacity (it isn't that big inside). There was at least a 30-45 minute wait between when our party of three sat down and when we got our first dish. They cut a few corners, like removing the dried/fried (I have no idea what it is) bananas that used to be on top of the banana bread french toast. It's a shame because that's what made the dish look awesome. It still tastes really good, but it looks very plain.

They've since updated their menu and got rid of the ambiguous \"After Lunch\" and \"Before Dinner\" categories, which is great news because what were they even thinking.

The food is still really great though and that's the most important part."}
{"text":"I ordered INSP burger shared with 2.5 year old son. A tasty burger with full of surprises. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday brunch with the fam and read great things about it so decided to check it out.  Free street parking was a nice bonus!  Food was excellent and great portions.  I had the Chicken and Waffles - 4 huge pieces of Fried Chicken & 5-6 small waffles all stacked up with a seasonal compote on top.  All the flavours really popped, was very good.  We also got the Butter Chicken Parmesan, which also didn't disappoint - also a huge portion and came with some tasty naan which tied it together nicely, a good fusion of tastes in that dish.

It was also super family friendly, came with a 3 & 5 y/o and they had a high chair for the little one, were really friendly and accommodating to the kids, which you cannot always say about every restaurant

We will be going back for sure next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Brunch at this place, it was quite surprising how flavourful everything is! I had the waffle with fried chicken and my boyfriend had the burger. I loved the fried chicken waffle and he loved his burger. 

We had the panko scotch egg as appetizer, it was so good! I wish it was a gigantic egg so I can enjoy it longer! Definitely something I'll eat again and again.

Waffle with fried chicken, waffle was crunchy outside and soft on the inside and the chicken was a blast of flavours! I believe they used various spices which I cannot pinpoint but it was much more flavourful than other waffle fried chicken I had before.

As for the Far West Burger, beef was good quality and juicy, again very flavourful. Their burger bun is also very soft which I like, seems to be a brioche bun or something along the line!"}
{"text":"I let it be known that I was scouring the city for a new dining experience. In came a friend raving about Inspire Restaurant; a relatively new restaurant on historic Main Street Markham that apparently served up exceptional meals. I had to investigate.

Though there is group seating, the restaurant is not all that large. If you're going to head to Inspire, get a reservation, because I certainly could not just waltz in. When you enter the restaurant you'll likely have the same trouble that I did trying to categorize its interior. It's somewhat dimly lit, with a mellow colour scheme, and decor that you can't really place your finger on. You might even say \"inspiring\". (I had to. No shame.)

When it came to the food, I kept with my current obsession; Chicken and Waffles. The chicken and waffles at Inspire is listed as including: chicken, homemade waffles, spicy berry compote, ginger maple butter, and berries. Though this is accurate, it does not at all explain the unexpected experience of this dish. The thick waffle is served with 3 pieces of chicken that hit the crispiness sweet spot. Not too giving, not too crackling. The waffle has a slightly green colour inside, that I can't really explain, but regardless, its doughy flavour pairs quite well with the spice of the chicken. Things get weirdly special with the spicy berry compote. Like the decor, I can't quite place my finger on what they were going for. You'll taste the sweet berry flavour that matches the syropy waffle theme, but right along with it you'll get a hit of curry-esq Indian flavour that supports the chicken. It was a welcome addition that I would have loved more of.

Though I didn't personally have the Dbl Bacon Cheesecake Burger, my friend did, and he loved it. The menu lists grade prime beef, matcha cheesecake, apple wood smoked bacon, pickled onions, and minced picked ginger aioli. Though we both saw cheesecake listed in the ingredients, we were thinking \"OK, so they're going to maybe incorporate some cheesecake sweetness into the bun\", or \"maybe the cheese itself will be cheesecake inspired\". Nope! They actually just toss a slice of cheesecake on top of the burger! His words: \"Weird\", \"It actually works!\".

Get a reservation. Go to Inspire. Try some inventive takes on food that you think you know. But don't go so often that I won't get a reservation ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! The salmon burger was unreal. Tender salmon, cooked to perfection with crunchy fries drizzled with spicy mayo. Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm. The restaurant is pretty small, and usually pretty packed, so make sure to make reservations ahead of time! There's parking alongside the back of the restaurant. 

Service was pretty good. Seemed like there were only two waiters working the day we were there. However, they were rushing around the entire time, and I felt well taken care of. My friend is a vegetarian and asked about the veggie options. The waiter helped us ask the kitchen, and came back with a very detailed rundown of which menu items were already vegetarian, and which ones could be altered to be vegetarian. I had ordered a coffee, and the waiter always came by before my cup was empty to see if I needed a refill.

I had the chicken and waffles, which was absolutely delicious! The waffle was freshly made, and it was nice and warm and soft. The boneless chicken was fried, and was crispy on the outside but tender upon biting into it. The whole thing was drizzled in syrup with a slightly spicy kick to it. The portion was huge. I managed to finish all the chicken and most of the waffle, but was super stuffed afterwards! There were several other items on the menu that looked very interesting, I can't wait to come back and try them!

The only negative about my experience, and why I gave this review a four star instead of five, is that we had a seat right by the window, and I thought it was a bit cold even though I was wearing a sweater that day. Hopefully they turn up their heat more in the winter..."}
{"text":"I've been to Inspire twice now, once for brunch and a second time for dinner. They have innovative Korean fusion dishes - any excuse to have fried chicken waffles and pork belly anything is a fun meal to be had! I don't typically like to eat fried food much because of the oily-ness but Inspire does a good job on that dish. The restaurant itself is very intimate and is the perfect spot for a first date or catch up session with your girlfriend. It's a great neighborhood spot and a lovely addition to the restaurants along Main Street. Give it a try and let me know what you think of it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Extra Butter\" Coconut Shrimp as an appetizer.  The dish had beautiful presentation and the butter ginger coconut sauce was divine.  I just wish it had more than 6 pieces of shrimp as you are paying $14, so I don't see the value in ordering it again.  

For the main entrée, I got their signature INSP Burger with duck confit fries.  The burger was absolutely delicious.  It had the juiciest prime beef patty I ever had. the ground beef was well seasoned. The burger had so many dimensions of flavour, the tomato mayo slathered on a super soft brioche bun and was further enhanced by a generous slice of smoky pork belly and the creaminess of a fried egg.   For the side, I upgraded to the duck confit fries, the fries were dressed with kimchi mayo sauce, red chilies, green onions and shredded duck meat were also tasty, but the only thing that concerned me was the Yukon gold potato fries were too salty.  

I would come again next time to try Inspire's other highly recommended Udon Carbonara.  Too bad, I only have room for one entrée at a time."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time to inspire restaurant and I wanted to try their brunch menu. We ordered \"korean beef\" and \"curried crab met pork and eggcellent\". We really like the korean beef and we came to a conclusion that their beef items are the best.

We felt the Curried crab met pork and eggcellent is too salty, and too much spice. But it js still worth to try."}
{"text":"We drove two hours to get here (from downtown Toronto) so anything would of sufficed. First of all, no where did it say we had to make reservations to be able to get a table. We walk in and it's a full house. Hostess says we do not have anymore tables for the whole night but will take down our number if any cancellations come up. We leave and 5 minutes later we get a call. We are seated and are told we have an hour to eat. We placed our order pretty quickly and the food came within ten minutes which was pretty awesome. I ordered the Udon Carbonara and Duck Confit fries, my friend ordered the Inspire Burger. I found the Carbonara pretty good but would not order the fries again. My friend didn't enjoy her burger but would order the fries again. Even though the hostess said we had an hour, there were 5 empty tables behind us which were more than the people that were seated. One thing that we found annoying was the cucumber water. Who wants to have flavoured water with flavoured food? They didn't ask us what kind of water we wanted. They just assumed we liked flavoured water. The flavour was so overwhelming it overpowered the bitterness of the burger. Would we ever drive there again? Probably not. Based on the comments it seems overrated and the food is mediocre. I think the only thing we agreed upon was the Carbonara. Would you drive here just for the Carbonara? Probably not. The portion size was small (it looks like a lot). If you don't live within a 15 minute radius, we wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4 on Saturday for brunch. Amongst us, we ordered 2 corn pancakes, an egg benny, chicken & waffle and a pull pork poutine to share. The portions were really big! We all have pretty big appetites, but we struggled to finish the food. Portion-wise, a dish per person is more than enough food.

Out of all the dishes, my favourite was actually the pulled pork fries. The subtle BBQ pulled pork flavour complemented the creamy aioli. There was an interesting addition to what I think were cucumber shreds. It helped cut the greasiness of the dish. 

I got the cornmeal pancake for my main. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed at the dish. It looks impressive, but the texture and taste was lacking. The pancakes were dry and quite dense. I think they can improve the dish by poaching the eggs instead of scrambling them. The salmon was quite fishy...The pork belly slice was decent. I would suggest they omit the salmon and put another slice of pork belly in the dish.

I got to try the chicken and waffles too. Like what the other reviewers have mentioned the waffle was soggy. It seems like their batter contains too much moisture and they did not let the waffle air out on a cooling rack before serving. On the other hand, I enjoyed the fried chicken. It was flavorful and the meat was juicy.

Since it is quite a far drive for me and the food is just average, I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Super cool fusion menu with twists on classic dishes! I had their chicken and waffles. It cost $18 but it was a very large portion and presented very well. The chicken was for the most part very juicy and crispy, but I found some of the edges a little too fried. The waffle was sweet and complimented the chicken nicely, however my waffle got a little drowned in the syrup and became too sweet for my liking. I also got to try some of my friend's piled pork fries as a side, and they are absolutely delicious! Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"4.5/5

I came with a group of 8 and made reservations couple weeks in advanced. The restaurant is not that big so a reservation is a recommended for large groups. The setting has a rustic hipster vibe but dimly light for an intimate feel. 

I had the INSP burger and upgraded to the pulled pork fries. The burger was stuffed with tons of toppings, including a juicy patty, greasy pork belly and a fried egg. Definitely a hearty burger that was on the greasier side. 

Pulled pork fries were amazing! Definitely recommend as the meat melded with the fries nicely. 

I took a bite of my friend's chicken and waffles. Great combinations of savoury and sweet flavours! 

Our waitress was attentive - filled our water often and came to check up on us in good timings. 

This fusion restaurant is definitely a great place to try but due to the price, I don't see myself returning often - only occasionally."}
{"text":"Love the chicken waffle! Maple syrup adds extra flavor to the fried chicken! Pork bun is less likely recommended as the bun is quite had to bite.
Love the side fries with mayo and pull pork fries are quite good, but it would be perfect if there is sauce to it!"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting concept. It has the \"toronto downtown\" vibe we are missing in GTA. I love this! The place is cute and cozy, the server was really friendly - even though he messed up our bill.... multiple of times. But it's all good, I get it - he was prob exhausted from the weekend.

Everyone got the chicken wings waffle - personally I didn't see all the hype around it.... I find it kinda odd having waffle and chicken wings together. 

I got the pasta! A little bit small, but loved it! I would def be back to try other things on the menu. They also have a pretty good drinks menu as well - a little bit pricey in my opinion, but it was pretty damn good.... so I'll let it slide! 

Overall, good vibe, good place, amazing food. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check out the restaurant for sometime so we opted to dining in at lunch. The overview of this restaurant is that Inspire is a solid place to dine, but in my opinion just wasn't that memorable.

Food: We opted to try 2 staple items, the first being the Inspire Burger (paid extra to upgrade to the duck confit fries) and the second being their chicken and waffles.

The Inspire Burger was definitely more of the highlight of my dining experience. The burger itself is juicy and the added egg to the burger was in and of itself a component that I enjoyed. The duck confit fries was on the other hand was a regrettable choice. I found that the duck confit lacked taste for one and was definitely on the dry side, slightly overcooked might I say all in all wasn't a fan. 

Chicken & Waffles was okay. Felt as though the balance of savory and sweet wasn't there and it just felt overly sweet to the palate. Other then the imbalance, I didn't hate the dish itself, rather it could have been better. 

Service: Attentive and friendly nothing that really wowed me but got the job done. Also it was a quiet afternoon and we were just chilling for lunch so my expectations is at a minimal anyways. So to sum it up, service was great. 

Ambiance: I do really like the setup of the restaurant, feels nice and cozy. The intimate feel of dining area is perfect for small get together. 

In summary, I would recommend Inspire to people, its good restaurant that has lot of good things that work. However its just not my cup of tea, but I'm not opposed to never come back (maybe to try some cocktails and their Udon Carbonara)."}
{"text":"If you want a chance to dine at Inspire, you definitely need to plan ahead and make a reservation during busy periods. I went once spontaneously on Sunday and was told by the waitress that they were fully booked until 9:30pm. This restaurant serves incredible food for a good price, which might just be the reason why it became so popular. 

I've been to the restaurant once so far for lunch because many people were recommending the chicken waffles there. Unfortunately, they did not serve that during lunch hours so I ended up getting the Korean beef sandwich, which exceeded my expectations. The sandwich itself had great flavour, and they don't skimp out on the meat. I added a few dollars to upgrade my side to the pulled pork frites and it was worth every penny. The frites were cut thin and packed full of pork and other flavours that made it so delicious.

 Overall, I had a good time at Inspire restaurant. The place is small and quaint, great for date nights or with small group of friends. I will definitely go there for dinner and try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants to bring family and friends to try something delicious and different.  However,  being a vegetarian,  there is only 1 main option -  udon cabonara.  I've had that about 5 times now.  Every time i go there,  I'm the one picking up the cheque and the last dinner was $300.  While worth it for my guests to be happy,  I wonder how many times I can come and eat the same $20 meal.  I honestly think the chefs can invent something else that's vegetarian.  Although,  vegetarians are typically the exception,  sometimes they are also the ones deciding on what restaurant to go to and the one paying the the bill.  I hope this is helpful feedback for the restaurant.  At least this restaurant does have a veggie option,  a lot of others do not."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat here for awhile after reading fellow Yelp reviews.  I brought my husband here for our Friday night date.  The restaurant was very nice, great ambience, cozy nice decor just something different for Markham.  

I ordered the udon carbonara and it was amazing, tasted so good while originally concerned it may be too rich and salty but the flavour was perfect.  The meal came piping hot which meant they cooked it fresh.  Although it did get very rich towards the end.   My husband had the body builder burger with pulled pork fries and the burger was gigantic. He barely finished it ESP if you upgrade it with the pulled pork fries. I found the fries to be nothing too special but the burger was definitely flavourful with that charcoal smokey taste, yum.  

We really enjoyed the restaurant and the food and would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Atmosphere and service was great.  The drinks and food were very flavourful. Great fusion of many flavours. The only minor negative is the food was a bit salty for my taste, nonetheless, I would come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a weekend, and really enjoyed it! The restaurant is fairly small, so coming here for brunch without a reservation is probably hectic.

The benedicts are average, but would highly recommend the chicken and waffles, and come hungry! The portion size was large! 

Would definitely come back and try other items on their menu, and perhaps even their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Overview: Top notch burger,  subpar ribs
Came here in a Friday night. They were fully booked but 3 seats at the bar were free. Our Waitress was really nice and told us about the menu when asked.  We ended up ordering the inspire burger with the $2 add on of the pulled pork fries and the inspire Luau. I must say their burger and fries were top notch. It was juicy,  and flavourful and all around a good burger. The luau platter was good aside from the ribs. I was disappointed with how dry and little they were.  No bone which is why they were probably dry. Hence 4 instead of 5 stars. But everything else almost made up for it.  The cheese fritters, pork belly,  taro mash, and panko duck was really good.  The sauce on the side made the dish.  I have no idea what it was but it was such a good complement. I think the waitress said it was a fennel cilantro Aioli. Lastly we ordered the green tea chili cheesecake.  Again, great choice.  The cheesecake wasn't overpowering with a hint of green tea.  The chili and candied ginger added a great kick.  Overall,  I would definitely come here again.  And with a changing menu how could I not!"}
{"text":"Nestled among many small shops and restaurants on Markham Main Street, Inspire is a French / Asian Fusion restaurant that offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Weekend Brunch Menu. We must come back for brunch sometime!

Simple menu with a good amount of selection yet isn't overwhelming. Unfortunately we didn't get to try out the dessert because we were so full after the main course!

Duck Confit Frites
Between Pulled Pork and Duck Confit, it was a tough choice but we decided to go with the Duck Confit, which was more unique.  Topped with sweet Shallot Aioli and ground pepper together with freshly fried Yukon Gold Fries, this appetizer was very appetizing and surprisingly filling. Once the dish reached our table, we were captivated by the rich deep fried smell. The fried garlic slices gave it a very strong flavour. However it did get a little dry midway through eating.  

Udon Carbonara
Spicy Italian Sausage, braised beef, honey mushroom in creamy reduction topped with quail egg. Fusion of Japanese and French cuisine. We found this dish very unique as the use of udon instead of pasta made it a much lighter main course. The cream sauce was very rich with braised beef, sausage and bacon bits. The freshness of the alfalfa and mushroom certainly balanced out the creaminess of the sauce. Where did our quail egg go though ?

Chicken & Waffle
Chicken & Waffle is a signature dish here at Inspire. We all have to agree that it looks amazing. This dish is basically deep fried breaded chicken pieces with home made waffles topped with fresh blueberries and syrup. It is slightly spicy with chilli pepper and ground pepper. The ginger syrup goes extremely well together with the waffle. the waffle was so very soft, rich and buttery and is the highlight of this dish. Only complaint is that the chicken breast was slightly stiff. Sweet, salty, sour and spicy all in one dish!

This small restaurant has a very modern looking interior with unique decor everywhere. However, it was VERY stuffy and did not have enough ventilation. Perhaps they didn't turn on the AC? We were seated at the window seat and half way through eating, and we were sweating.

We had a great experience at Inspire and enjoyed the food very much! We would definitely return again to try out other unique fusion items on the menu. We definitely recommend this location for everyone who likes to try new quality fusion food items. Since it is such a small restaurant, you really should make reservations as they are very popular and constantly packed during dinner hours. Have fun and enjoy !"}

I came here twice, once with family and once on a double date. The first time, I was so unimpressed and disappointed that I almost forgot about coming here. Second time, I was thoroughly impressed not only with the quick, reliable, and respectable service, but also the food quality. We tried the chicken waffles, the inspire burger, a japanese squid buffalo burger and INSPIRE Luau. Both burgers exceeded expectations in size and taste. Definitely not what I expected, since it's been 1 year between my last visit. The chicken and waffles went really nice with eachother and the chicken wasn't dry at all. It was pretty juicy and tempted me to want more. The pure meat dish was just pouring out of meat. I just expected a duck leg with little drizzles of other meats and sauces here and there, but that was not  the case! Definitely super full after that meal and didn't even need dessert or an appetizer. I definitely thought the second chance was worth it and worth the time and effort to travel up north to here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with 4 others. They originally said they don't take reservations for groups of 5 but they'll make an exception for us. Weird. 

I ordered the fried chicken burger and upgraded to duck fries. Also got the pulled pork fries on the side. My SO had the insp burger.

Overall, fries were tasty - but don't order this expecting the typical fried fries. These are more soggy and drenched with yummy sauce. The texture is more as if the fries were stir fried. The pulled pork fries had minimal meat. The fried taro they topped it with made it extra special. Love that crunch! 4/5

The fried chicken burger was good - not soggy (tried to gobble that down asap). 3.5/5 Shared it half and half with my SO. The insp burger was nothing special. We both agreed the egg was weird. He liked the quality and preparedness of the meat though. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to come here twice thus far. I came got brunch and dinner. 
The place is quite small to expect to wait during busy hours, unless you make a reservation. Staff were all very friendly and had a good knowledge of the food. One waitress was even able to provide input on a drink to customize to the customer's tastes - well done. 
We started with the pulled pork fries. Delicious. If they ask if you want pepper, say yes. I'm not a huge black pepper fan but it enhanced this dish. I can't say I've had this type of fry experience before meaning, it was delicious and unique and I would order it every time as an app.
I then went for the infamous chicken and waffle. The first several bites were delicious! So many flavours to enhance your plain old fried chicken and waffle. And it was HUGE. is recommended sharing it as it was quite heavy. The only downside to it was the fact that the waffles got really soggy from the sauce and flat, ie. No more fluffiness.. I'd suggest perhaps subbing the syrup/sauce in a container on the side and have the customer drizzle it on themselves to avoid this one minor issue. 
Dessert! We ordered both their desserts to share because they sounded so freaking good on the menu. First was the matcha cheesecake. We were VERY disappointed. But we did appreciate the effort and the labour put into it. It's basically like an uncle tetsu cake but 4 times smaller. It was the size of a cupcake for $12! And the matcha flavour was very subtle. There wasn't anything special about it other than it was served in a dim sum container. Luckily we ordered the other dessert which blew us off our seats. SO delicious and a must order!!! This was also $12 but it was 7 times bigger than the cheesecake. And so many flavours! It has banana bread waffles with delicious ice cream topped with capt n crunch. Yum yum yum. 
Overall, I enjoy coming here and would return."}
{"text":"Has a downtown feel even though its located in the burbs. Very unique menu with funky items you just want to try.  Price isn't bad for the burbs. Seating is limited so be sure to make a reservation. They also close a bit early. We went here for my friend's birthday, got a 8:30pm reservation since it was the only one available for a Friday night. We chatted till they physically had to ask us to leave since they were closing. LOL. Overall, great food and friendly staff that served us."}
{"text":"i really like the duck fries. Udon tastes good as well, it is very creamy but might be too greasy. my friend's chicken waffle is a bit too dry. I prefer more sauce."}
{"text":"BEST FUSION FOOD I've ever had!

Quality of food vs. price point is excellent!  

We ordered 
Pulled Pork Frite $8 - Very unique tasting frite!  
Panko Scotch Egg $5 - O so yummy for $5
Chicken & Waffle $15 - I've never had waffle with chicken before, and I'm not sure any other time would beat this one!

Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad $15 - Excellent light dish.  Definitely a top or second top dish at our table!

The INSP Burger $15 - Wish I could have asked if the frites that came with this dish could be changed to pulled pork frite, so that we could have spent the money to try one more dish!  Definitely among the top burgers I've ever had!

Udon Carbonara $18 - a little too spicy for my liking.. the raw quail egg really helped to  tone it down

Seafood \"PAELLA\" $26 - A favouite among two of the people at our table, but I was so-so on this dish.  

Atmostphere really suited the fusion style.
I noticed in the washroom they had different types of coloured wood.. which really suited their fusion theme!  Modern and artsy, romantic restaurant!  An excellent date selection!  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely shit,  we did not get a table because it was reservations only which is fair but I drove 30 mins and needed to use the bathroom I wasn't allowed to use the washroom because its for customers only. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Nice flavor profiles. Something for everyone. Udon was my favorite. The Chicken in the Waffle was tender and moist. The Hanoi salad was a little under whelming, with very little flavours resembling Vietnam. Attentive service. Would go back to try more."}
{"text":"Super duper impressed with this restaurant.  Came here with a group of 7, we had a reservation, they kept it and we didn't have to wait (this doesn't happen as often anymore).  Great service, both ladies were super friendly, took our photos happily when asked and we always had our water filled.  I ordered the INSP burger, which was DELICIOUS.  It was cooked medium (just the way I like) and was super flavorful.  I'm a huge fan of having an egg in the burger and I'm glad it came with it.  The fries were also very flavourful and they give a HUGE portion.  If you haven't been, go make a reso and head on over!"}
{"text":"Great place to get decent quality food for the price paid
Nice atmosphere 
Good service
Clean washrooms 
One of the best places to eat on main street markham
Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork poutine, topped with fried taro bits and a sauce - make sure to mix this together as per the menu instruction. Pretty presentation and quite a large portion of fries, the plating makes it look smaller especially under all the fried taro shaving. I enjoyed the less bbq sauce doused pulled pork that was still super savoury. Blended nicely with the almost non existent taste of taro bits. The sauce was similar to an aioli mayo to me.

The girls ordered loco mocos to korean bennys to tacos and salads. Most enjoyed their food, no complaints aside from the fact they couldnt finish their meal. Quiet for Saturday lunch time, although we arrived as soon as they were available at 11:30am. Service was good!

I loved visiting Markhams' Main Street (I only knew of the Unionville Main Street, also in Markham, prior to this weekend), small but dainty and cute, especially do take a visit to see their Saturday market of local food and craft."}
{"text":"Taking two star off for their service. We were seated at the back of the restaurant for Friday lunch. Tried to get waiters attention several times to get water however, he didn't even look our way. We would watch him look around the restaurant then go back to the bar, completely missing us waving at him and trying to call him over. This continued when we were trying to order, get re-fills of water, and pay bill. The food itself was great (chicken waffle = best!) but very disappointed by the service. It could just be that one waiter, or just not his day, but have to say, it made the entire experience unpleasant for us :("}
{"text":"WOW! Is all I can say about our experience at Inspire. 

I've been meaning to try this place for a while and finally found some time to go. 

From the get go, our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and gave us some good suggestions. We ordered everything she told us to.

We got the duck fat fries as an appetizer and it was really good. The kimchi aioli really went well with the fries. It set the bar for the rest of dinner.

We also got the chicken and waffles as it was highly suggested and the smoked ribs with fried cheese. We didn't know what to expect of the chicken and waffles and were pleasantly surprised with how well the berry compote complimented the well, chicken and waffles. Sweet and savoury done perfectly in one plate. My one complaint is that there were chunks of star anise scattered all over the food and I wasn't a huge fan of getting a bite with some of it. The smoked ribs and fried cheese dish was also superb. The ribs, although not saucy, were super juicy and flavourful. The fried cheese was made in house and super yummy too.

Can't wait to bring our friends here and try the rest of the menu :)"}
{"text":"We highly recommend this place!

Went here for lunch on a Sunday. Place was not busy at all. Service was excellent. Seating space was small so it will probably be best to book reservation on peak time.

Hubby's obsession with chicken and waffles was highly satisfied. Star-anise flavour with blueberry compote was great mix. Wifey tried the salmon poke bowl and it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"A small local restaurants that serves an Asian fusion flavour and/or ingredients combination. I have meant to try this place for some time. A friend of mine came to visit, I recommended we go to this place for dinner. So I made a reservation the day before, and glad I did. Because even on a Tuesday evening, this place was a full house. One suggestion I would like to add is: perhaps an online reservation system? 

Onto the restaurant. The decor is simple yet stylish. Simple wooden chairs and tables that are very functional. Also the lighting seemed a bit dim at first. But once we sat down, that wasn't the case. On top of that, the staff are friendly and efficient. Once we placed our order, food came out not too long after.

Onto the food. We ordered the following: Duck Confit Frites, Chicken & Waffles and Udon Carbonara. After seeing the pictures from other posts, I gotta try these. And these didn't disappoint one bit. The frites had some 5 spice added along with some chopped chilies. They aren't overpowering in terms of spice flavour. Instead the spice complemented the frites and duck very nicely. The chicken and waffles had a compote with beans and mango that went with the ginger maple butter. This combo of flavour came in layers and it was like WOW. The chicken was a bit crunchy yet the meat was still juicy. I was pretty amaze with the flavour. Then the udon carbonara arrived. Don't expect this to be same as other carbonaras. It's far from what I have tasted before. There's quite a bit of black pepper to go with the steak, also the Italian spicy sausage is a nice addition. The udon was just al dente and that's how I like it. Can I even use al dente with non pasta?? hahaha! Flavour for this dish can be on the peppery side. So just a head's up. But overall taste of the udon carbonara is excellent. 

Just a summary, if anyone wants to come to Inspire. Please do make a reservation. Food is great, got lively music to match with the mood. Serving staff got great attitude. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best unconventional restaurants in Markham in my opinion. Everything on the menu looked pretty appealing, I didn't know what to choose!

liked: duck tacos, udon carbonara, chicken steak waffles (loved the mix of sweet and savory)

didn't particularly like: pomme cocktail (tasted alright nothing special), pork taco (I thought it was too saucy and wet for a taco) 

Nice ambience as well. A nice little spot for a date!"}

Absolutely delicious and extremely original and unique food...
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! I went here with my husband for our anniversary and we had an amazing time. The place is romantic and quaint. Staff were very polite, knowledgable and quick. And most of all the food was epic! We had the soft shell crab, inspire burger and ceviche. Love all the creativity I.e. colours, textures and flavours put in our dishes. The presentation was very artistic and beautiful. Would highly recommend to anyone!!f"}
{"text":"Last Friday, we arrived at Inspire Restaurant at 2:35 pm and was greeted with a silent stare. The hostess behind the bar looked at her watch, then up at me and said nothing. I asked if we could be seated and her response was a very rude \"we close at 3 and last call for seating was 2:30\". 

She continued to look at me without saying another word and I was flabbergasted that this kind of terrible service would be considered acceptable in this day and age where service is just as important as the meal experience itself. 

Had the hostess been a little more friendlier in telling me I was just five minutes shy of last call or to come back and visit another time, we would consider going back as we were excited to try out the restaurant. 

Sadly, I think my family and I would prefer to drive mid or downtown for similar style restaurants where we are normally made to feel welcome."}
{"text":"First let's get the important thing out of the way: the food is spectacular! It is such a unique spin on very classic dishes, and there are some dishes that you can't really get anywhere else. They have some very innovative uses of spices and flavours that can be a hit or a miss with people. For example, their chicken and waffles leans towards the sweet side. I thought this was interesting and quite enjoyed it but my best friend was not a fan. 

The service here is good. They've hired young people to go along with the trendy feel of the restaurant. The only issue I had was that they lost my reservation once. I had called ahead to reserve and received confirmation, but when I got there, they did not have me listed at all. Because this place is always packed, not having a reservation could be a problem. They managed to squeeze us in and gave us a complimentary pulled pork frites for the error. Now this is customer service done right!

The decor is lovely. Like its food, it has a modern Asian fusion feel. Though the place is not very big, it still feels quite cozy. Portion sizes are great and prices are reasonable. Overall, a very successful dining experience."}
{"text":"My family and I were here during the Victoria long weekend. It's a fairly small restaurant about with only 2 larger tables that seat between 6 to 10 ppl). The rest of the tables are either 2 seaters or table for 4 or less. They had a couple of seats by the bar. I would suggest making reservations. The service was good. The server brought water with mint right away and they came back a couple of times to see if we had any questions. They are known for their gourmet burgers and we were not disappointed with the selection and taste. Our boys (ages 8 and 4) shared a plate of regular hamburger which was still a very good size with regular fries on the side. The meat was very juicy and our 8 year old loved it and cannot wait to have another one. The burgers are server on a cutting board with a piece of paper on the bottom.  I had The Insp burger and that was definitely one of the best burgers I have tasted in a long time. The burger came with prime beef, seared pork belly, fried egg, american cheddar and tarragon mayo for $17.00. The sauce was to die for.....I added the duck confit fries on the side for extra $4.00. The fries weren't bad. It wasn't hot enough tho (felt like it was sitting at room temperature for a little while) and I find there should probably be more sauce to top off the fries - they were a tad dry.  My hubby had the Inspirer Poulet Hamburger for $16 and he thought it was really good. The fried chicken was juicy.  His confit fries were not hot enough either and he wanted more sauce on the fries - maybe some type of gravy or something similar. The ambience is casual and the staff is friendly. We will definitely come back the next time we want a great burger!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is amazing and portions are worth it. Best items are duck pulled pork and paella!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor is so cute and the service is excellent. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles and the duck poutine fries. The mango chutney that comes with the chicken and waffles is so good and has such a unique flavour. All good things aside, I don't recommend the chilled beef Hanoi salad because the protein portion is SO small. It was literally 4 thin slices of pho type of beef. The salad wasn't bad and it was huge but probably to compensate for the small amount of protein . Make sure you grab reservations and try to get the window seat - it's the best seat in the house!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars. The service and food were stellar. I'd recommend trying the udon carbonara and INSP burger with the duck fries. Amazing. 
The owners clearly put in a lot of effort into their menu and their chefs deliver. I'm a huge fan of Asian fusion and they definitely satisfy. Reasonably priced...make a reservation however they are almost always busy."}
{"text":"This place is so romantical (yes, that's a word). Two thumbs up for atmosphere. From the (very) dim lighting (honestly, I turned into a possessed Yelpie, shining a flashlight on my food for a picture), drapes, and cozy atmosphere, it's a charming spot to take a significant other. But don't get me wrong, it's great for small groups as well. The atmosphere is welcoming and hosts a diverse menu - overall, a nice little gem in the 'burbs of Markham.

We ordered: a) chicken and waffles, b) udon carbonara, c) and for dessert, the caged chocolate mousse. Admittedly, I expected a lot more from the meal. The food was pretty average to us - while it was beautifully presented, it was all flash, no substance. The chicken and waffles were a bit too sweet for our liking, same with the chocolate mousse - it was all sweetness and monotonous in body with no real complexity in flavour. The Udon carbonara was probably the highlight of the meal - a delicious and unique take to a classic favourite! 

Overall, despite pretty average food, we still enjoyed our time here. It was a nice Friday-night-dinner kind of spot, atmosphere was pleasant, and service was attentive. 3 stars for the food and pricing. 4 stars for atmosphere and service. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we spent around $54.00 (keep in mind, that's without drinks). Note that a parking lot is located just adjacent to the restaurant, so no need to hunt for street parking."}
{"text":"Its a small, but nice place with great food.  The service was ok, nothing amazing or out of the ordinary.  We went there with a party of 5 and we didn't realise most of the food had something spicy in it.  There wasn't any indication on the menu.  4 out of 5 of us ended up with something spicy and didin't expect it.  Needless to say some of us drank a lot of water that night.  Food did taste good, but it would have been nice to know what was spicy or not.  Please put it on your menus!!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with my boyfriend and got seated near the bar seats table.

The decor was decent and lighting felt comfortable. There was only one waitress that was working but she was able to provide quality service and attended to all tables.

We ordered the pull pork frites as a appetizer and it was decent, nothing special. The fries weren't crispy enough.

I ordered the famous chicken and waffles and my boyfriend ordered the inspire burger. Both had very nice presentations. The chicken was great, crispy and tender on the insider. The only downfall was the waffles, it was drowned in syrup and became too soggy for my liking. The burger was well seasoned n medium cooked, which was nice. 

Overall, no complains but really nothing special. I really wanted to give higher and brought into all this Yelp hype but was left feeling it was just mediocre. 

I would come back on a day of wanting comfort food but definitely not on a regular basis as it gives you the nasty filling of doing something terrible to your stomach and health."}
{"text":"The lettuce pray and chicken waffles are amazing!!  Atmosphere has gotten much better as well."}
{"text":"We came here for friend's birthday dinner. it is my first time here and I was surprised to find a cute little asian/fusion restaurant located in markham Mainstreet. It is not really a 'stand out' kind of restaurant when you pass by. It is quite small when you go in. it has 2 large table for bigger parties (we had a party size of 7) and a few small tables on the side. It is no wonder you'll need reservation because this place will get crowded. 

As a usual yelper, I would read all the reviews to see what to order. 
My review is based on my own personal dishes that I ordered (Which I absolutely enjoyed). Other dishes were complete misses for me --- so I probably wouldn't come for awhile

I really enjoyed the UDON carbonara - it was chewy, flavourful and very filling. 
Enjoyed the duck fat fries! Who doesn't??! 
Also enjoyed an appetizer we shared, the Scotch egg! REally lovely batter surrounding the egg and a nice way to share and start the dinner. 

Since it was a birthday gathering, we ordered all the desserts to try. Some were beautifully and creatively plated and served. However, I don't remember too much about the overall taste.

I did not like the chicken and waffle. The taste of the chicken had a hint of spices that reminds me of curry. It is not the typical flavour of chicken and waffle that makes it go well together. It was also very dry chicken as well. A little too dry for my liking."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom for Lunch.  I had the chicken and waffles.  It was delicious.  The chicken was well marinated before it was friend.  The coating was crispy.  Everything about it was delicious.  My mom had the Inspire burger.  It was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Inspire was recommended to me by a few locals who live in Markham. The restaurant is located on a cute street that has a very date like vibe that you can walk along and enjoy the weather! On the weekends there are free street parking so it is really nice. 

The service was really good! They greeted us right away and showed us to a table of 6 that we reserved. The restaurant is very small and has mainly tables for 2 so we were told we should make reservations.

The menu is small and has just the perfect amount of selections so we are not so overwhelmed. Each of us got a different dish and everyone was super pleased! I got the vietnamese beef salad and it was a generous portion. It was fresh and light and the sauce was delicious! 

Others got the salmon burger, loco moco (amazing), chicken and waffles (one of their signature dishes), udon carbonara and the INSP burger. ALL DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Having heard about this place on Instagram, I've always wanted to try it out. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I loved the dish. The highlight was definitely the fried chicken. It was a bit crispy. The waffle was okay.  Overall, I was very impressed.

My friend also ordered the inspire burger with the confit fries. The fries were amazing and I definitely recommend ordering it. I'll be looking to get this the next time I go.   

I definitely recommend booking ahead of time, as it is a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"I have revised my review to 3.5 solely due to consistency within the last year. I have been here at least 5 times and notice a difference in the quality of food. I believe there has been a change in staff. Nonetheless, it is located in Main Street Markham where you can go grab ice cream after or walk around the street. Recommended dishes: chicken and waffles and the carbonara udon. The udon is good, super creamy and rich in flavour. It comes with sausage bits, mushroom and an egg on top. There is definitely heat to it. Again mentioned above, throughout  the year, it has changed a lot in quality time I probably will not be back for a while. If you do go, I would recommend either booking online as the restaurant is quite small. If you call the day (Friday/sat) most likely you won't get a reservation until after 8. The staff members are pleasant and super helpful when it comes to recommendations."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant a few weeks ago. Parking was difficult to find, with the restaurant being on Main St. Markham, but eventually found a spot in a parking lot behind the restaurant. 

This place was packed and the layout is rather cramped with most of the tables being in a row, 2 feet from each other - you could easily hear the table-beside-you's conversation aka not the best place to take a date or nefariously scheme.

I ordered the Udon Carbonara, as it is one of the most talked about dishes on Yelp. It was pretty good, but not life-changing. I'd give it a 7/10. It tastes like normal pasta but with the thick udon noodles in a cream sauce. I guess the texture is unique, but it was only slightly better than the kraft dinner I make at home.

The service was pretty standard as well. 

Overall, this place is pretty overhyped. Still good, but failed to Inspire me."}
{"text":"On the north end of Main Street Markham, Inspire is a cozy place in Markham. They have a lot of parking spaces located on the right side of the shop. Walking into the store, I felt like it was well designed, with a fusion of asian and caucasian feel - the fireplace and the touch of wood really made it. 

The waiters/waitresses are all very nice and patient, kindly explaining what was on their menu for those who have never came before. Their chicken waffles were great the first time with fresh meringues, pomegranate seeds and fennel seeds. However, the second time, the waffle was a bit smaller, had melted meringues and tomatoes were used to replace the pomegranate seeds and the appearance did not match up to the first time I went. Their other foods are still great, their INSP burger being a fulfilling specialty.

I really want to come back and try their creme brulee dessert - if they still offer it."}
{"text":"So this is an update to my original review and I have to say maybe after my first experience my expectations were super high.

I sat down as we had reservations and were promptly seated at the window table which was nice.  They handed us 3 different menus which included their drinks, regular menu and brunch menu.  Right away I noticed that my knife was dirty so I asked that I get a new knife.

I ordered the duck tacos and the Korean sandwich.  Considering the prices which are fairly steep we got two duck tacos and they were just average.  Nothing special that warranted $6 a taco that's for sure.

My Korean sandwich came out and I got the pulled pork frites.  I quite enjoyed the pulled pork frites as it was flavourful and had just the right mix of sauce and fries.  The Korean on the other hand was a little bit disappointing.  Again for the price you would hope to get some quality cut of beef but this one was grisly and made eating it very tough.  

After our meal we asked for the dessert menu and instead were presented with the bill.  Again asked for the dessert menu and had the chilli green tea cheesecake which was surprisingly delicious and had just the right combination of green tea and a bit of a kick to it.  Probably this was the highlight of my visit.

Overall, it definitely did not live up to my expectations and for the price I don't think the quality was there but it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday during lunch and the place wasn't busy. They have a small menu but I definitely find the items unique and I felt like I must try them all! I came here today, however to try their Chicken and Waffles.

We waited at least 25 mins for the food to arrive, so be prepared to wait that long for food. But I was impressed by the chicken and waffles! It was delicious! The chicken wasn't greasy and the amount of syrup was just perfect! I recommend getting that for sure.

Service is pretty fast but I suggest making a reservation as there is very limited seating in this small place.

Would go back to try their pasta next time."}
{"text":"Summary: modern look, pleasant atmosphere, and convenient location makes it a nice place for a date, but food was somewhat underwhelming

Top Must-Get: ...I have to come back and try some more things first!
Top Regret: chicken and waffles**

**Yes, the famous chicken and waffles... They were alright, but not nearly as outstanding as I anticipated.

A friend and I made reservations here for lunch, and had really high expectations. We got here promptly at our reserved time, and were greeted and taken to our seat. It's an intimate spot, with a slightly dim decor, and a hint of old-fashionedness. The tables and chairs are a bit small, but overall, it's got a good vibe. 

We had a hard time picking what to eat, because while the menu is simple and straightforward, it has a LOT of delicious-sounding foods. We ended up grabbing the INSP burger, the Udon Carbonara and, of course, the Chicken and Waffles.

The burger was, in fact, pretty solid. Juicy, tender meat, egg, and mayo - mmm yeah, I was originally going to write that no burger is going to be worth $16, but thinking about it again is giving me second thoughts....

But if I really, REALLY think about it, $16 IS really pricey for a burger, albeit one with two different kinds of meat (pork slices in it too). Was it good? Sure. Would I rather have three Harvey Angus burgers for the same price? Probably.

The Udon Carbonara was fairly saucy and was deemed \"good\". 

Which brings us to the chicken and waffles.

Oh, the highly anticipated chicken and waffles.

I'm clearly going against the grain here, but I didn't love it. 

Now, I don't mean to say the chicken and waffles HERE weren't good - I think that I simply don't enjoy the taste of chicken and waffles together. I like my waffles crunchy-ish, and after a while, the syrup sort of makes the waffle skin a bit soft and it just doesn't... feel right?

Anyway. Each to their own. If YOU think you like chicken and waffles, you might like this! But for me, it's sort of like beef tendon and green tea ice cream. Independently and separately, they're great - but together, it just didn't work for me.

Both my friend and I felt not-so-good after lunch, but that might not have anything to do with the food - just something I'll be paying attention to when I come back.

And I WILL eventually come back, because I really want to try the duck taco, duck frites, and pulled pork - however, my honest feeling is that my first visit was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I was so ready to tackle their huge burger + fries combos after a 6km run in the morning with no breakfast. We came here around 11:40am on a Friday, and the place was nice and quiet then, but the noise certainly picked up as customers started flocking in around past noon. The Japanese Squid Buffalo Burger had a lot of textures, though the squid and crunchily breaded buffalo were too hard for my liking. The INSP Burger, on the other hand, offered a good balance between textures and flavours, probably because it had a runny fried egg and the fatty pork belly, which helped retain moisture in the burger.  

Between the duck confit fries and the pulled pork fries, the winner is definitely the pulled pork fries; the duck was a bit dry with the hot chili. Also, the pulled pork fries had taro strips on top, so it was aesthetically more pleasing and added more dimension to the fries. 

Service was good; waitresses were attentive and kept on pouring water for us."}
{"text":"Came as a group of 5 for lunch.  Was definitely impressed. Had the salmon burger and it was good! Would definitely come back to try other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one Sunday without making a reservation. At first they told us it was going to be a 30-40 min wait, but I think we ended up waiting for fifteen mins. To air on the safe side, make reservations.

Really liked their decor. However, because we were sitting right across from the kitchen, my clothes had a pungent kitchen/oil/fried food smell afterwards.

Food was a decent portion. We ordered the pork belly Benny and Korean beef with eggs. Pork belly Benny was awesome but the beef and eggs was just mediocre. Their home fries has a hint of curry taste too. 

Price-wise, definitely on the expensive side. Our bill came up to $40+ for not a ton of food."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this restaurant. My family and I did not have reservation for dinner but we were early enough that managed to get a table for 3. The server was pleasant and friendly enough to tell us that we have an hour as the table was reserved. I have the Inspire burger with duck fries. The presentation of the food was outstanding and the taste of the burger with Canadian bacon was as good as it look. The duck fries was a pleasant surprise as well. Fries mixed with duck meat and special sauce. The decor, the great service and food makes it worth every dollar we spent at this place. I will sure to recommend to my friends and will return very soon to try out the rest of the menu items."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly easy to miss. It's a tiny little restaurant that almost looks like a part of a house. It isn't very well lit. Upon entering, you  have to go through what looks like curtains. I can definitely say it didn't look anything the way I was expecting. The tables are wooden and simplistic. The decor is very much east meets west. There are about 30 seats in the entire restaurant, and only 2 servers. Service was friendly, although it could be a tad slow. It seems as though some of their menu items get changed periodically, as there are foods I saw in pictures on Yelp that they no longer have on their menu, and new ones that have not been added to their online menu.

One awkward thing about their place settings is that if you intend on sharing food, the dishes on which to do so are the dishes that they place your cutlery on. They're these long oval dishes that are usually for serving appetizers (like our shrimp). They're incredibly awkward to eat on because it's so easy for food to fall off of them.

Had:

Sea-wings ($12) - 6 mussels and 3 flower octopuses with some kind of breading and some hot sauce, topped with thinly sliced red onions and a sprinkling of herbs. For the portion, the price was not bad. The mussels were a pretty good size, and I can't complain about the way they were cooked. The octopuses were tender, but still needed to be chewed for quite some time. This dish was a tad salty. For those who are into buffalo wings, this will probably be your kind of sauce. I'm not a buffalo wing person, so this was not my kind of sauce.

Coconut shrimp ($12) - 6 decent-sized shrimp. We expected these to be deep fried. They were not. The coconut sauce was light, but very flavorful. My favorite dish of the night.

Pulled pork frites ($8) - decent portion for the price. Fries could have been crispier. Pulled pork was quite tasty. Presentation was interesting. Sometimes, Asian restaurants will put rice in a bowl, then flip the bowl onto the plate to give the rice a bowl shape. They did this with our fries. It looked like a bowl when it came to the table. When you squish fries, sad things happen. I quite enjoyed the large mound of fried taro shavings they placed atop my fries. Actually, I enjoyed the taro shavings more than the fries themselves.

Chicken and Waffle ($16) - this is the dinner portion. When I have chicken and waffles, I'm expecting really crispy fried chicken. At Inspire, I got really tender chicken that wasn't breaded very well. There were large sections of my chicken that had no breading. The menu description says that it's \"crisp chicken\". My chicken was not crisp. I could not find the cinnamon whipped butter (but for all I know, it could have melted). The spicy berry compote had star anise in it, and thinking they were berries, I actually bit into one. I couldn't taste much anything for a while after that. My suggestion would be for them to strain out the star anise before adding the berries, if they want to get the flavor of the anise but not kill their customers' taste buds. The maple in the ginger maple sauce was definitely there, but it could have done with a tad more ginger, if they were going to call it that, because I had to search really hard for those ginger notes.

The dbl bacon cheesecake burger ($20) - comes with fries. I believe it was peameal bacon (and I'm not sure what was double about it). This was supposed to have matcha cheesecake in it. I mean, we got this for the novelty of the cheesecake. What we received was a really delicious burger (served medium and super juicy), but the matcha cheesecake was a letdown. I was expecting a good sized portion of cheesecake in my burger, and not just some tiny cheesecake crumbles. It looked like burnt avocado crumble. If you didn't know it was there, you'd probably not realize what you ate. I had some of the cheesecake by itself, and it definitely tasted like cheesecake. My brother's girlfriend said she could definitely taste the matcha. I could not. I would definitely get their burger again, but not for the cheesecake.

Udon carbonara ($18) - got this one because Yelp said this is the one to get. It was pretty good. Very creamy sauce. Loved the mushrooms. Lots of Italian sausage. I got maybe one piece of braised beef (and I didn't know it was braised). The portion was okay. I'm guessing the fusion aspects of this were the udon and the honey mushrooms. The honey mushrooms were a delightful addition to this dish, but I think actual pasta would have worked better than udon here.

Shiitake New York ($32) - I have no idea why this costed so much. I can get steaks at steakhouses for cheaper. The menu says deconstructed. They deconstructed the steak by slicing it. Pft. Bacon corn replaced by baby bok choy without informing us. Sweet potatoes were good. Wellness of the steak done properly. Wouldn't get this again.

I enjoyed my dinner, but I'm not quite a fan. Price to value ratio wasn't good enough. I feel a tad let down."}
{"text":"It is recommended to call and book a table at least a week before you decide to come. I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday for Sunday brunch. My friends had chicken waffles and Korean beef / eggs.  They enjoyed their meal.  I chose the salmon burger for a healthier option.

The place is pretty small with a dozen tables.  The seat time is max 2 hours during the brunch session. The service is excellent as the servers stop the the table several times and fill water. The place may be hard to find as the front does not stand out.  There is parking at the back."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant tucked in an out of way corner of its building. Be careful because it's actually really easy to miss. Atmosphere is nice, staff are young, friendly and helpful. We went there on a Saturday night, where they have 2 sittings that are 2 hours long. Plenty enough time to eat. Portions are good size and price is very fair. I had the chicken and waffle which was pretty good except that I felt there wasn't enough sauce and it was a bit too oily. I started picking the fried bits off my chicken because it was starting to give me a headache. Also, I only got one tiny bit of the cinnamon whipped cream which filled one square of a waffle quarter. We also ordered the pulled pork frites which was also really good, but felt was lacking in sauce and didn't have much pork pieces in it. 

I would definitely come try again for some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Food is so delish!  Great food portions that you actually get to walk away with a doggie bag.  I've been here twice, once for dinner and the second time for brunch.  Can't wait to go back a third, forth and fifth time!"}
{"text":"3.5 star rating here. Came here for lunch with a large group to celebrate two friends' birthdays. I should prefix this review by saying that reservations are strongly recommended at least a few days in advance (more like 2 weeks for our party of 16). The hubby and I attempted one Friday night last autumn to get a table by walking in but were turned away due to the restaurant being fully booked for the night.
My first impressions were that the restaurant has a cozy intimate feel. The menu is limited to about 20 items total. I ordered the chicken and waffles with ginger spiced syrup. The chicken pieces (dark meat) were moist but covered in a nicely battered crunchy coating with a bit of heat. The waffles were fairly standard but elevated with the blackberry (?) preserves that were served with with them. If you don't like your chicken too sweet, you can ask for the syrup on the side. While the chicken and waffles were good, I personally prefer the more classic flavour profile of chicken and waffles from places like Dirty Bird in Kensington Market.
Despite the fact that I was not wowed with my own meal, I did enjoy the pork sandwich 3 ways that my hubby ordered. The outside of the white sliced bread was toasted in a manner reminiscent of grilled cheese sandwiches, and the pork was flavourful and not dry. This dish came with a choice of fries or salad, or for a small surcharge, you can upgrade to duck confit fries or pulled pork fries.
Because of the delicious pork sandwich, my hubby and I agreed that we would like to return here to try some of Inspire's other inspired offerings, like their signature burger and short ribs as is.

{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the years, and I've got to say that I definitely am a fan. Solid quality, cute interior, and intimate ambience with options for groups or a cute date. Pretty versatile! They also have different menus for lunch and dinner. 

Their frites are to die for. They're super skinny, slightly soggy, meaning they absorb any sauce perfectly. I had the duck frites and it was worth risking an exploding blood vessel. 

Their sandwiches were amazing too. Buns were soft and the inside and toppings were very filling. The assortment of veg in their burgers complement well with the heaviness of the chicken. 

Service was a little meh. Nice, but not super attentive. I didn't mind though as prices were the norm for places like these. Parking is much better at the back. 

I really liked their cucumber water. It's super refreshing. :)"}
{"text":"\"Omg inspire is the best place in markham omgomg, it's SOOOO good\" Just kidding. This isn't every other review on this page. Maybe I expected a bit too much, but I didn't fall head over heels for inspire like every other girl. 

When we walked in, we weren't really greeted by the server. She looked at us and said \"do you have a reservation?\" and kind of grimaced when we said no.. then without a word, she led us to the back of the restaurant and gave us menus. Her mood probably got better, because she was a lot more tolerable and friendlier as the minutes passed. The server assigned to our table, however, was amazing. She was super quick, friendly and caring- kept checking up on our water levels every once in awhile so there were no shriveled up dehydrated bodies left in the restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered the pulled pork frites to share and OMGGGGGGG THIS IS WHAT LOVE FEELS LIKE!! I don't even like green onion but it worked SO well for this dish.. to be honest, I didn't want to share with my boyfriend anymore... I would've taken the whole dish for myself but he drove me here, and I don't want to be left behind. We each also got a chicken and waffles (super famous here) after we couldn't find the udon carbonara on the menu.. WHAT HAPPENED? The serving was huge and it was presented nicely but I've had better fried chicken from KFC. The waffles were yummy, but too much syrup.. I would've preferred that we all get control of our own syrup next time. It ended up being too much and I finished just around half when I got it to go and gave it to my boyfriend, since he devoured his even though he said it was too sweet as well. 

It was nice to try! I'll probably be back and try other dishes! Somebody please let me know if the udon carbonara comes back!"}
{"text":"We came here after church for a nice brunch after hearing good things about it  online.  Inspire serves amazing fusion food - with inspiration from both the east and the west.  The location on Markham Main Street is perfect because it's convenient to walk in and then walk out and around after a good eat.  Because we came around 1pm on a Sunday, it wasn't very busy - there were two other families in the restaurant besides us.  There were four of us and we were able to order from the brunch menu which is only available on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:30 to 3pm.  

We ordered two starters - the Sweet & Sour Pork (sapporo pork tips, tamarind glaze, apples, and togarashi) and the Pulled Pork Frites (braised pulled pork and sweet shallot aioli on hand cut yukon gold fries).  The sweet and sour pork was really good - unlike your typical Chinese takeout.  Cripsy, juicy and tangy - a tad bit salty but good nonetheless.  The pulled pork frites were an instant favourite among our group - and we all have different tastes.  Their fries are the perfect blend of crispy and soft and the flavour was amazing - the pulled pork, the light drizzle of sauce and the crunch and textures made it really good. 

We ordered one item from the \"Think Inside the Bun\" section (sandwiches).  We got the Korean - grade prime rib steak, kim-chi slaw, and pickled cucumber on a French Baguette.  When you order it, it comes with either fries or a salad.  We got the fries.  The fries are the same kind you'll find in the pulled pork frites but they come drizzled in a sort of kimchi-mayo sauce.  The sandwich was very hearty - you can really taste the quality of the meat and the veggies and the baguette made it a well-rounded order.  

All our other orders came from the Brunch menu.  We got the Eggs Bennies, Korean Beef & Eggs, and the \"Peking\" Corn Pancakes.  The Eggs Bennies is: soft poached eggs, butter croissant, honey glazed pork belly, chili hollandaise and bacon hash potatoes.  It was really good - hearty flavours that combine for a filling brunch dish.  The Korean Beef & Eggs - grade prime beef, sunny side up eggs, and bacon hash potatoes was also really filling with great flavours.  I had the \"Peking\" Corn Pancakes - maple glazed charred jalapenos-filled pancakes, spiced pork belly, and aged cheddar.  What drew me to them was the idea of a spicy and sweet combination.  The pancakes were really good but I wish they had a side of maple syrup because it got a bit dry.   They were also thicker than your average pancake - reminded me of cornbread.  I loved this dish - the sweet and spicy flavours went really well together, it was another food experience, and added to that was the aged cheddar and the spiced pork belly making this brunch dish quite the delicacy.  

I would definitely come here again and I hope that people passing by on Markham Main Street step in to give it a try.  The food, its presentation, the atmosphere and the service is amazing.  Fusion food at Inspire is a definite must try - classy, fresh, innovative, and, of course, delicious."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend on Saturday October 16. 

My friend had made reservations to celebrate my birthday. I have tried to dine here before but unfortunately the other times I have came they were packed and the wait was 30 minutes to an hour. This time we didn't wait at all we were seated by the window. I did you know that the wall around the window is actually wood made to look like the NYC city skyline. Me and my friend were both very intrigued. 

I had the inspire burger and she got the salad. I couldn't try any of her salad because I have a nut allergy but it's smell had a lot of Thai flavours which is what said on the menu.

The burger was soooooooo good! It was cooked to a medium rare. The flavours were really interesting, I liked the Asian style pork belly fused with the American burger flavour. And also the brioche bun was soooooooo good. 

The only negative I have is that when we were trying to pay a lot of the servers had their heads down, so it was hard to get their attention. 

But a solid 4/5! Will come again!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about the restaurant and finally decided to try this place out. It's a nice cozy small restaurant in Main Street Markham. We went for lunch and my friend recommended me to try the Butter Chicken Pasta. It was absolutely delicious and the butter chicken was definitely top-notch with the unique spices and flavours. Definitely would recommend that especially those trying the restaurant for the first time. The price for lunch was pretty good. The restaurant highly recommends making reservations. Will return again and try other delicious foods."}
{"text":"Inspire cooks up a great unique menu that is a welcome change in Markham. We came here on a weekday for lunch and I had a much more enjoyable experience this time around than my first (which was for dinner). 

I'll start off what impressed me the most: the INSP burger and the pork three ways sandwich. There's not much to say about it, the burger was juicy and delicious. There was a fried egg and pork belly in it with some special mayo. It just worked perfectly together. And so did the sandwich, it was smoky and sweet, brought together with the bacon ketchup. Their fries are pretty good too. 

I was impressed by the stone pecan salad actually. It was light and refreshing, and I loved the kick of heat from the jalapeños there, which contrasts the sweetness of the dressing and fruits. 

The item I wanted to try the most disappointed: I felt like the chicken and waffles were average. The fried chicken wasn't anything special. It was crispy but wasn't juicy and lacked spice/flavour. I think it needed some tang in the form of a sauce. Maybe we should have just asked for ketchup. The butter chicken serpentini was good in small amounts, it was really creamy in a good way! If you've read my reviews you know I'm not a fan of heavy foods and I felt like I just couldn't eat too much of it due to the butter and cream. But without a doubt it is legitimate butter (tandoori) chicken.

Service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. Just don't forget to reserve!"}
{"text":"After finishing exams, Inspire seemed like the perfect place to celebrate because of its delicious food and cozy atmosphere. Although it would definitely be ideal to reserve a spot beforehand, I thought it would be worth mentioning that I was able to dine twice at Inspire - both without reservations! So if you have a last minute craving, dont be discouraged by not having a reservation in advance :)

I ordered the chicken and waffles ($18) while my parents ordered a thai chicken burger ($18) and a rice dish ($25). Although wait times were a little long, the servers kept all of our glasses filled with refreshing cucumber, lemon and basil water and I enjoyed the comfortable vibes! My chicken and waffles were PHENOMENAL (one of Inspire's staples), my dad enjoyed his burger but my mom found her rice dish a little disappointing. With that being said, it was a great experience overall and I'd come again for the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"6pm on a Sunday and Inspire was packed. Unfortunately I did not have a reservation and our wait was estimated to be 2 hours for a table. We asked if we could make a reservation for the bar, which they kindly accepted. This shortened the wait to about an hour. 

Upon being seated shortly after 7, we were given our menus. Having seen countless pictures of Inspire's dishes on Instagram, I had already prenarrowed my options down to the INSP burger, the Chicken and Waffles, and the Udon Carbonara. I ended up choosing the INSP burger, while others in my party chose the Chicken and Waffles. 

The INSP burger was amazing - nice and thick, it included grade prime beef, seared pork belly, a fried egg, and tomato mayo. It was incredibly juicy. As a side, there was a generous portion of lightly salted shoestring fries. The presentation was equally as good as it was nicely arranged on a wooden board. One of the best burgers I've ever had. 

I tried a few bites of the Chicken and Waffles as well, and was also impressed. Nice, sweet, and tender, it's a shame I had to pick between the two.

I know I'm sounding like a broken record now, but the service was top notch too! There was a TV right in front of the bar that was just showing a simulated fireplace..... So we jokingly told the waiter that the only way our experience would've been better was if they changed that fireplace to the NBA Finals game at 8. She actually did!

All aspects of my experience at Inspire were great. Now I only wish I had more reasons to visit Markham, just so I'd be able to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Friday night for 2 people. We called to make reservations around 6pm and got a table around 8pm. I have tried walking in a few times and wasn't able to get a seat. It was dim where we sat and it was quiet enough in there for a conversation, unlike other trendy restaurants in the city. 

There were a few tempting options, but I settle for the chicken and waffles. It came with a blueberry compote and a slightly spicy and sweet syrup. The portion was very large the chicken felt freshly fried and the waffle was still hot. The chicken was tender but had a bit too much breading, it was still good nonetheless. My friend got the burger with pork belly, again the serving was very large, and it came with shoestring fries which were alright a bit on the soggy side. 

The service was pretty good and its a great addition to the markham neighborhood there's not many places to get this kind of food uptown."}
{"text":"Loco moco - coconut rice yummy and the beef reminds me of angus beef patty taste of mcdonalds. Not bad and worth a try if you like gourmet-like burgers

Korean Steak - medium rare steak tastes good but not better than Baton Rouge

Chicken waffle- chicken was marinated very well. Waffles are ok

Salmon with corn pancakes - not enough salmon for me though - 3 small fillet pieces + pork slices. . Pancakes were very good"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see a new restaurant open on Main Street. We were there the first day they opened and there for the grand opening. We haven't ordered anything but take-out, so I can't rate them on dining service. 

Here is what we've tried:

Pork belly sandwich (our fav item - order it ALL the time!) - nice french bread, delicious sauce that complements the well seasoned pork belly - I could eat this sandwich EVERYday!!
Korean - seasoned well, fresh ingredients, good quality meat
Far East Burger - cooked to perfection, the grilled pineapple really completes this simple but flavourful burger - love the mango mayo! If you don't like medium rare - that's how all their burgers are prepared based on the high quality of meat they use - make sure you let your server know.
Duck Taco - my least favourite item - didn't find that the duck tasted all that great & wasn't a well put together dish for me. Also didn't find that there was a good amount of duck vs cucumber orange salsa - couldn't taste the aioli either. Very bland - would not try this item again.
Pulled pork frites - pulled pork with fries - can't go wrong!
Hand cut fries with aioli - another one of my fav menu items - we always order extra fries and be sure to ask for aioli with your fries. If you're unsure about it on the fries - ask for it on the side - you won't be disappointed.

I wish the burger & sandwich would also be included on their dinner menu. They have been pretty by the book about not allowing those items to be ordered at dinner even if it is for take-out. Also they have a cut off time to order lunch for take-out and pretty strict about it too. Maybe one day we'll stop in for dining. :o)"}
{"text":"We went to Inspire for brunch, we went there because it has good feedbacks from friends. Nice food and cosy atmosphere. Servers are very nice and served well. I would definately come back again to try for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Apparently everyone has been here already time for me to try this place first of all parking was great there's a side lot with lots of spots the restaurant is small but very nice and cozy the server was really nice and friendly always checking on us.  We started with  duck confit fries very big portion and very good also enjoyed the short ribs for good food definitly worth a try"}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner and ordered the salmon burger. It was surprising because I ordered salmon as a healthy alternative to beef, but it turns out, with the combination of toppings like the creamy avocado, its even more delicious! Hands down one of the tastiest burgers I have ever had."}
{"text":"Pretty decor and nice music, face towels in bathrooms to dry hands, overall environment is pleasant. 
Food is average however, below average even. The place is overrated and very overpriced for the food quality - there is nothing special about it.
We had duck confit fries and Korean sandwich. The fries were so salty, it was difficult to swallow. The sandwich was just average, don't see what is \"fusion\" about it. The chicken with waffles may be considered fusion, but many places serve that, for a better price too. 
Won't be coming back and won't recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Inspire about 3 times now and I must say everything keeps getting better and better. When I first came here in 2014 there was only one server and she was not very helpful or friendly. Thankfully things have changed (probably due to popularity) and there's more staff,  friendlier might I add. 

The food has stayed consistently good, but the menu has definitely changed for better or for worse. Consistent goodies are still here: Udon Carbonara, Chicken and Waffles, Banana Bread French Toast, Burger and Fries. I have tried the Butter Chicken Serpentini and it was spicy and delicious but quite a heavy meal. Meals are pricey but not any pricer than Joey's or other generic restaurants. I would say keep supporting your local restaurants that strive for quality. 

Inspire actually takes reservations so highly recommended you make one since it is a small restaurant and always busy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a party of 5 on a sat morning. We tried the chicken & waffles, bennies, and the loco moco. Everyone loved the bennies and loco moco, largely thanks to the delicious flavors and well cooked steak. The presentation was pretty too.

I enjoyed the chicken, which was very juicy and crispy. The waffle was just meh tho - became soggy quickly and mushy. I also wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was just a bit too tangy.

Overall, a great brunch experience and the waitresses were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had REALLY high expectations of this place.. Heard it was amazing. Heard it was hard to get a table. Heard it was soo worth the money...I guess it just didn't live up to expectations.

Went for Sunday lunch and it wasn't busy at all, so easy to grab a table. I got the inspire burger with pulled pork fries ($20). Sad but true, the fries were way better than the burger! 

The burger was average. The pork belly was just way to squishy and hard to eat, and the fried egg was poorly cooked. Although, the fries were amazing! Pulled pork was super crispy, fries had amazing sauce drizzled over it, and it definitely made the meal.

As for decor, A+! Super cute on the inside for such as small place and servers were all super friendly. 

Overall...didn't measure up to the hype, but I heard the chicken and waffles were good, so might return eventually to try that!"}
{"text":"Summary
This is a great restaurant. It's mostly western foods with a bit of Asian fusion inspiration added. The selection isn't huge, but the quality and flavours are great, with a nice ambience and great service. Reservations are recommended unless your having a late brunch or early dinner. The cost is fair ($15-$20 per dish) and the portions are generous. 


Environment
Decently lit, so it's quite easy to see everything. There's nice decor, and a custom playlist with electronic-chill music. 


Service 
Fast and friendly service. They were quite busy when we came in so the food took a while to arrive (we were a very large party, so it was understandable). They also gave us complementary pulled pork fries, which were great. 


Food 
The INSP burger was one the of best burgers I had in my life. It was very filling, delicious, and not too large. The pork belly added some amazing flavour, while the egg provided additional creaminess. 

The pulled pork fries were great, and the taro crisps on top brought them to the next level with the texture (after mixing). 

The Chicken Waffles had some amazing fried chicken, while the waffles had an interesting spice flavour, but was still great. The texture was a bit softer compared to traditional waffles. 

The Drunken Crustaceans were creamy and full of flavour, and would be recommended for a lighter meal as it didn't have any carb component."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken & Waffles at Inspire and I gotta say: I was impressed. At 15 bucks, you'd be hard pressed to find Chicken & Waffles this good. They garnish the dish with blackberries and raspberries which give the fried chicken a hint of sweetness. The portions are great too! I tend to eat a lot and after this particular meal, I didn't have room for dessert.

I also have nothing bad to say about the service I received. The waitress who was tending to my table was very kind, friendly, and had lots of great recommendations for my friends.

I was very happy with my experience at Inspire, and the next time that I'm in Markham, I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I had heard amazing things about Inspire before coming, and I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed - in fact, Inspire exceeded my expectations tenfold. 

I had a difficult time with their menu because so many of the items looked AMAZING. I don't know if I've ever had such a tough time choosing an entree at a restaurant. I ended up deciding on the Chicken and waffles, since I have yet to try this popular dish at any restaurant up to now, and it was exceptional. The fresh fruit, mango edamame, and ginger syrup was an amazing combination with the fried chicken - an awesome balance of sweet and savory. The breading on the chicken though also had a bit of a sweetness too, and was very good. 

The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is very cool - would go back again and again, and would recommend to anyone.

One tip, that I will also share below - make a reservation! This place is hopping, monday through sunday, and twice before coming today I tried to walk in and found them completely full and booked up. Take the time to reserve your table - it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"From the lunch menu I had the Pork Belly sandwich for $13. It was great, however I would have preferred the baguette to be a little thinner so I could taste more of the pork and less of the bread. I upgraded my side of fries to pulled pork frites for an extra $2... an exceptional value IMO. The pork was delicious and was topped with a shallot aioli and potato haystack. Next time I'm going to try the duck confit frites for an extra $4. Wife had the $15 Korean sandwich (which I had on my previous visit) and the dish still impresses."}
{"text":"Came here for a night out with Jen.
Note, that this place changes their menus every so often to keep the inspiration alive.  Known for its fusion dishes such as Udon Cabonara, butter chicken pasta, it's quite an enjoyable culinary experience in a bohemian ambiance full of lovely decor.  
Their service is great and their menu has the perfect amount of choices whether vegetarian or non-veg. Portions are sufficient. 

For starters we tried their 
Drunken Crustaceans: Presentation was superb, and the sauce was delightful.
Duck confit with fries: Mountain of frites with pieces of ducks smothered with cheese, dish was okay, presentation was lovely.

mains we tried their Udon Cabonara to share
all complimented with a glass of red.

Overall Inspire is a great culinary adventure that always has a think outside the box fundamental which will always keep its customers coming back for more."}
{"text":"All things good chicken and waffles, and matcha coconut trifle with phyllo.  Everything was dish coming back again for the soft shell crab and duck confit fried rice.  The staff are very friendly and accommodating we didn't know it had gotten so popular we had to make a reso but the found a table for us after not too long.
My main was delish but I forgot to take a pic of my dessert after I tried a piece of the phyllo yummmmm"}
{"text":"Awesome unique menu. Have gone three times and can't wait to go back again. I dream of the Udon Carbonara. Once you have it, the original Italian version seems like nothing. Place is kind of small so you can't do walkins - reservations are a must."}
{"text":"After a year of trying to get over the bad service, I finally had the opportunity to try this place with my friend. Made reservations on the day of and actually got them, surprised me a bit, I guess it's popular but not like when it first opened its' doors.

The menu was interesting with Asian fusion choices, the combinations were interesting. Udon Carbonara, Chicken Waffles and etc..

I ended up ordering the Udon Carbonara, same as my girlfriend. The food was good but I can't say it was very delicious to a point that I'm desperate to come back tomorrow. Service was attentive. All in all, a place that is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Having been here twice, I've come to like Inspire Restaurant for what it is.

It's essentially a fusion restaurant, merging flavors ranging from deep fried chicken with Asian flavors, or pulled pork with chutney and honey.  

Their duck tacos from the appetizer menu is a must try, with its sweet, tender duck meat capped off with their cucumber orange salsa! Yes, orange salsa!

The udon carbonara was creamy white wine reduction, with a bit of a kick highlighted by the chorizo.

The drinks menu is pretty simple, not much in the way of beer selections.  Sapporo was one of the top choices, a preferred of mine.  A pretty decent but short wine list from red to white and bubbly. 

Ambience wise the place is simple, reminiscent of a bar.  Spot lighting fills the wooden accents on the tables.  Word of advice: in the winter months, ask to be seated away from the windows as the restaurant as a whole is quite drafty and can be cold, especially if you're sitting in the front areas of the restaurant.  Front door needs more coverage as anyone coming in out results in a cold blast filling the restaurant.

Definitely have their INSP burger, with its pork belly and fried egg - definitely a top grade burger for burger lovers out there like myself!

Service is overall good, waters were refilled without being asked. I think one of the servers is actually the owner, which is great because you seldom see the main person in charge ever around!   

For now, 3 stars until the temperature issue is kinked out.  Especially for the upcoming winter months! I'll revisit for brunch, dying to see what the butter chicken penne is like!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends a while back and got the duck confit fries and a burger. Definitely worth it on the flavor angle, with the burger having a complex dynamic of being fresh and satisfying. I would recommend the fries to anyone coming here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Inspire Restaurant - I liked it and will be back to try out other items on their menu!

I've heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and have been itching to try it out. I made reservation for 6PM for 2 on a Saturday and good thing I did because the place filled up pretty quickly (so don't take a chance! Call them in advance and make reservations to avoid disappointment). 

We shared the Duck Confit Frites ($12) as a starter - the frites were topped with mayo & Thai chilli and was very savoury! The chilli added a slight kick to the frites and the sweetness of the mayo balanced things out nicely.

I came here mainly for the chicken & waffle ($17) and was not disappointed! The chicken was crispy on the outside and the meat was juicy. The waffle came with spicy berry sauce and it was tangy on the tongue!  

Service was great - the waitress kept coming back to check on us and refilled our water. Overall I think this is a cute little place and you can always end your meal with a nice stroll along the historic Main Street Markham!"}
{"text":"Decided to come last minute from reading the reviews. 25 minutes away from where we live but well worth the drive. Note: Make reservations on the weekend. I called for a reso while in the car driving there. I got lucky and had the last deuce for 6:15pm spot. 

Ordered the duck confit fries to share as a starter. Perfect quantity to share for two people. I was expecting more bursts of flavor but overall great dish. 

Entrees ordered were udon carbonara and Indonesian
Chicken rendang. Both were packed full of taste and the portions were large so you have some to take home and enjoy the meal a second time. :)

We opted out for the dessert because we were so full. Definitely a place to go back. Since its a bit out of the way we'd go back for a special evening for us or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out a new place for a late brunch and this place did not disappoint.  We ordered the Chicken & Waffle with egg, Korean Beef Sandwich, and the INSP burger with cheese. 

Chicken & Waffle came with a nice crispy waffle with a generous portion of 3 juicy, crispy large chicken pieces (3 whole boneless thighs?), ginger maple syrup, spicy berry compote (could not taste the spice at all but nice nonetheless and not overly sweet), and a fried egg.  I really enjoyed this dish but it felt like something was missing... maybe a little kick in the fried chicken or maybe a little thick gravy to contrast further with the sweet and salty - I'm not sure but I would still recommend that you try this though... the amount of juicy protein in this dish is incredible! 

INSP burger - prime beef, seared pork belly, fried egg, & tomato mayo.  I had a bite of this and the prime beef was perfectly cooked and well seasoned; the pork belly had a nice sear without being dry and the tomato mayo was nice.  Decent size with fries on the size. Another dish where a little kick (maybe deep fried jalapeños?) would be welcome but still great on its own.  This was the first to disappear from our table - it was fully inhaled within minutes! 

the Korean - prime rib steak and pickled cucumber on a french baguette with duck confit fries... The duck confit fries was a decent size (small bowl worth) and the French baguette was reasonable even though my companion kept raving about how good it was to where they wanted to order seconds but was too full to move. 

For dessert, we had the Sweet Toffee Pudding with oreo topping (silky and creamy; not overly sweet, with the oreo crumbs adding texture) and the Capt'n Crunch banana bread... not overly sweet; I don't know what I was expecting but it was pretty good... come check it out!"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and decided to try this place since its close to home.  Had the Osyter Po'Boa for starter, the bao was nicely fried and the osyter was a great pairing with the cabbage. I had the Chicken and Waffles which was lightly battered and the waffles werw soft with a light drizzle of syrup. The hubs had the King Osyter Steak which was cooked prefectly and had a great sauce. Would def recommend this place if you want to try something new and great to support small businesses."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I've been here twice now within a months time. They greeted me with such care and it was nice to see genuine people working there. I got seated ASAP and the place was absolutely beautiful! The décor was very artistic and used regular items like wood (for their tables and wall and their ceiling decor).  

Can't even begin to rave about the food. It's amazing!!!! Every single herb and spice in their food, you can taste all the flavors and its so different from other restaurants. This restaurant is definitely inspiring. 

Just had their chicken (2pc) and waffles with steak (1 strip) and omgod that steak... Totally worth the $10 extra from plain chicken and waffles (which comes with 3 pieces of chicken). I then had the salmon poke bowl... It was such a good appetizer. I had to eat it as an entree because I'm on Detox ha-ha! But I really do recommend people to try it. I'm sure you will love it too!!!"}
{"text":"Inspire remains to be my favorite place for fusion food. I love the chicken and waffles, burgers, and brunch items. I love the food here. The downside is that it is a small restaurant so it feels a bit tight. 

Highly recommend making reservations !"}
{"text":"Came at opening. Reataurant said they had reservations that they needed to hold for 15 min.  We said we would wait.  After 15 min we came back and they changed their story, now saying had the reservation at 6:30.  It seemed they just didnt want us as clients since we had my daughter with me."}
{"text":"This place rocks. 

it's always busy when you go, but the food is worth it - nice twist on asian fusion. Their chicken and waffles are the most unique i've had..but in a pleasant way. Their menu is quite small, but quality over quantity.

they also do brunch on the weekends..nice to know there is a decent brunch place in Markham"}
{"text":"In a league of its own.

During your orgasmic meal, you feel like you've left the dread of Markham & been transported to somewhere cool. . Trendy interiors matched with its outstanding service, but the real star is the food! Fusion cuisine at its finest...We had the duck tacos, pulled pork poutine & chicken/waffles. All 5 star dishes! This place is EPIC"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and really enjoyed it. This is definitely where east meets west at it's best. The flavours are bold and not for the weak. If you're fan of subtle flavours and finer things then this is not the place for you. They sure don't use spices sparingly here but somehow it all just works.

I have only been here twice so I can't speak to the entire menu but somehow I have the utmost confidence you won't go wrong with anything. Chicken & waffles is always a crowd pleaser but I did find that the burgers (meat and fish) are a tad on the dry side but it's a common problem we have here in Toronto (overcooked burgers). Salads are refreshing, light and quite tasty.

Service is attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This place is unique, busy and delicious.  My wife and I sat at the bar because it was a busy Sunday morning. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles, and the Lettuce Pray (Lettuce Wraps).
The Lettuce wraps were really tasty and full of different flavours and textures. The Chicken and Waffles was also very appetizing, however, the waffles were soft and a bit on the soggy side. (I would have to defer to Alchemy coffee on this one).
The waitress was kind and attentive to our needs.
We look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Excellent and creative food. Always a good place to take anyone to eat. Be sure to make reservations first."}
{"text":"What we had: the chicken and waffles, the INSP burger with duck confit fries, the banana bread ice-cream sandwich

Taste: 7/10

Steven's friend recommended this place to us and we had high expectations, so we weren't too impressed with the food here. 

The chicken and waffles were decent. The chicken batter was seasoned nicely, and it was crisp. There were two things that totally threw me off from this dish: one was this small pile of berry compote that was suuuuuper sour and did not go with anything, and the other was the licorice flavour they added to the waffles/syrup. I know they're trying to be innovative but these flavours totally don't make sense.

Steven liked the egg that they put into his burger. The burger needed some cheese and the meat needed some more seasoning. Decent burger. The fries were OK.

Banana bread ice-cream sandwich was yummy and great for for sharing. Ice cream was store bought tub ice-cream. Banana bread was made in a waffle shape which was neat.

Value: 6.5/10

Chicken and waffles were $16, burger was $15 (+$4 for the duck confit fries), and banana bread ice-cream sandwich was $12. On the pricey side for what we're getting.

**Average cost per diner: $29 after tax and tip 

Service/Convenience: 7/10

Even though their restaurant faces the street and there's a sign, it looks a little inconspicuous especially at night. We had to travel quite a distance and didn't find the taste here worth the travel time.

Our service was polite and efficient. There was one server that loved to chat up other patrons but he was very loud and we overheard his conversations even though we did not want to. (The place was small enough already and his voice projects very far.)

Would go back? Too out of our way and we'd rather go to Smash, so probably not.

Would recommend to friend? Nah, unless they live in the area, we wouldn't recommend any of our friends to drive the distance.

Similar places: Smash kitchen & bar

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"First time at this location.
Dam it was amazing! my number one western food by far. 

INSP burger was fantastic! full of surprise! 


will be back next week, bring some friends!"}
{"text":"My new favourite! Inspire restaurant is a small and cozy place. I came here for a friend's birthday and tables were pretty packed. Remember to reserve a table before coming here!

PULLED PORK FRITES 4/5
I would've given it 5/5 if they added enough mayo (sauce boss here). 
The pulled pork was very juicy too. Yums!

CHICKEN & WAFFLE 4.5/5
This was delicious! I loved how they added bits of pomegranate with the dish. The waffles were sweet and the chicken was very tender.

UDON CARBONARA 5/5
I'd highly recommend this.. This was the best pick out of the dishes we ordered. So creamy and flavourful.. We're definitely coming back for more of this!! :)"}
{"text":"First time I came I enjoyed Inspire from the atmosphere and decor to the service. The food was average and returning 2 years later their menu doesn't seem that much inspired. It's the same menu, American food with a pinch of Asian. 

It's more American style FOOD than Asian because it's so incredibly greasy and buttery. Any Asian flavours don't really stand out because of the fat content. In my opinion, their menu needs more balance, more acidity to cut the fat and less richness. I've been to Inspire twice with large groups each time and no one was especially excited about their food except their fries were better than most. 

Their BEER menu is limited to Sapparo or \"mystery beer,\" which is basically a tallboy of a craft you can find in LCBO. I tried their mystery beer it was Red Racer IPA. In my opinion this mystery beer isn't a good idea because most people who drink beer want a certain type a beer with their meal. For avid craft beer drinkers, they know what they want for what type of food they eat. For new comers to the craft beer scene it could be a hit or miss depending on what they eat. They could just find out that craft beer in general is awful because of the bad combination they had with this \"mystery beer\" and Salmon. At least let the customer know what type of beer it is.

Their SERVICE is good though. Can't complain about that, nothing was out of order and the waiters were all courteous and attentive. 

Their DECOR/ATMOSPHERE is great too, that's where all the inspiration went."}
{"text":"I haven't seen a menu this creative and appealing in a long time. This is what fusion cuisine is supposed to look like. You take a traditional dish like fish n chips and add something unexpected like matcha tea. Or you start with spaghetti carbonara as an inspiration and you totally reinvent it using udon instead of pasta. Great job! This place blew me away with their food. But they deliver the whole hip restaurant package complete with cool ambient music, modern artsy decor, pleasant, helpful staff and reasonable prices. Best part is you don't have to drive all the way to downtown Toronto which is where you'd expect to find food like this."}
{"text":"This was our third time here and the menu hasn't changed much. Same items just keep disappearing and reappearing another time. Need to break away from the frites ( doesn't matter what starch you use. A frite is a frite) although will admit that it's a great filler for the dishes. The krispy cream doughnut bread pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"Started with the lettuce pray which were amazing!

The entree was the fried chicken waffles with a whiskey sauce on top, which was also incredible. 

We finished with the waffle/ice cream sandwich which was fantastic. 

The atmosphere and staff were amazing. Staff were extra friendly. 

First time at this restaurant which was randomly found. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Markham? I don't think so. I had the INSP burger and found it to be extremely heavy. I mean it was good for the first few bites, but afterwards eating got really messy as it was soaked in fatty oils. The fries were also extremely oily. Would go back to try the carbonara though."}
{"text":"Amazing asian/American fusion restaurant. Fusion done right. This place has some French inspired elements as well. Has the burger and some of the salmon burger. I have to say that this is the first time I have had some good fusion. The menu is small, the way it should be. Pick dishes that are popular here and you won't be disappointed. 
Some great drinks here as well.
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No doubt Inspire has a solid menu and consistently good food. For brunch, I love the chicken & waffles - so soft & fluffy, paired with berries sauce. The loco moco is also delicious - can't resist coconut rice, taro and fried egg. The beef is a burger patty with a hearty gravy.  Definitely itis-inducing brunch!"}
{"text":"Made plans to go for dinner on a Saturday with a friend. The only spot available was 8pm so definitely make a reservation in advance. We felt kind of rushed as the waitress just came by with the bill and we hadn't asked for it but this was definitely because of the limited space. I think if they had a larger dining area I would have had a better experience. 

Everything felt very squished- you don't really feel like you have privacy. My friend and I were seated in the aisle for 2 which was fine. I'm rating Inspire as 4 stars because the food was delicious. 

The prices are slightly higher however not out of the ordinary compared to other restaurants on main Street. My friend ordered the duck tacos which came with shoestring crunchy potato-like toppings that added a great texture. She then got the carbonara which was really good. 

I don't eat beef or pork so I really only had 3 options : the sweet chick burger, chicken and waffles, or Dr. Shroom. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles and it was a great choice. It comes with a mango raspberry  edamame chutney which sounds like a strange combination but worked soo well! Iasked for the chutney on the side because I don't like it too sweet. I liked how the chicken and waffles weren't drenched in the syrup it was on the base with everything else on top. The waffle itself wasn't sweetened and cooked very well - light and fluffy. But the chicken was delicious!! It was fresh and hot and when eaten with the chutney and waffle and syrup it became the perfect bite!

I wish they added more vegetarian options on the menu as it really restricts vegetarians to one option. I would come back just to try the sweet chick burger."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped by here on our way into dt Toronto from Ottawa for brunch. Since we are both Chinese, we really enjoy Chinese food and thought we would try out this Asian fusion place. The interior is pretty small and not very well lit, but the food was fairly good! We got the chicken waffles, duck confit fries, and Korean steak bennies. It was all very filling and we had to pack up some of the chicken waffles. The chicken waffle presentation was pretty impressive and I really liked the Korean steak bennies. However, the duck confit fries were a little lacking... there wasn't much duck in them so I probably wouldn't order them again. The prices were a little high unfortunately."}
{"text":"There is something inspiring about inspire. Not talking about the food but rather its ability to build hype. Don't get me wrong the food is great...but great for Markham. Honestly it's an average downtown spot blessed because it's actually located uptown 

Service is fire. When you eat here expect to be pampered. Waitstaff was easily accessible and humble. However the hostess never called me back. I'm not bitter it's just that when I'm told to hold when I'm making a reservation, 30 mins is a long time to be alone with my thoughts. 

The food itself is pretty good for a fusion place. Being Asian I was raised never to upgrade anything on the menu. \"How much extras is the side of guac? ...Bitch please I aint that rich\"But those duck confit fries with the INSP BURGER are blessed. Honestly my mouth had a mini orgasm. And not like ur boyfriends one shot and done orgasm. But multiple tiny ones over the whole meal. The.burger itself was good. But honestly if you add an egg and pork belly to your already juicy burger were gonna have a good time. 

Was disappointed by the udon carbonara. 

It's a decent pasta dish but it's literally just udon in a standard carbonara sauce. I mean it wasn't bad it just wasn't inspiring. Same with the chicken and waffles. The serving size was good and the waffles were crisp. However the chicken itself, while juicy was over seasoned.  

That's the thing about fusion places is that there needs to be creativity and imagination. Subbing out one carb for another or adding an egg isn't fusion. Western and and eastern styles need to blend and bring out the best in each other. However INSPIRE just settles for meh. Maybe I'm a bit to hard on the place. However it calls itself a fusion restaurant, therefore I was promised creative and inventive new foods. What I got was pretty standard fusion fare. I'll be back but with lower expectations"}
{"text":"Great burger and salad. Funky surroundings/music. Hipster staff without being preachy. Would go again."}
{"text":"My friend booked out the restaurant to surprise his fiancee. We were given a set menu to order from, not the regular menu, which was a little disappointing. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles. 

Tried the duck tacos for appetizer. These were pretty good. This was the most impressive dish of the night.

Tried the striploin for main. The steak itself was only meh. For $32, I expected more. There was a huge tendon running through it that made it really chewy. It came with a side of taro fries?!?! This was a HUGE question mark. It was gross. Dry.. didn't come with a sauce. But not even sure if a sauce would have saved it. The pea puree was bland. Disappointed in this dish.

For dessert, it was a cheesecake with some candied bacon and chili on top. Not sure how I liked the spicy, sweet and savoury all at once.. 

Overall, some items were worth it. My fiance had the burger which tasted pretty good for only $15. The duck fat fries - I've had better. 

Not sure I would be inclined to come here again."}
{"text":"April 20, 2018 - I give this place a 1/5 
I ordered Chicken and Waffles (crisp chicken, homemade waffle, edamame raspberry chutney, ginger maple butter and fresh berries).....  my cousin ordered Lettuce Pray (crisp chicken, bacon and cheese, tarragon aioli, and kbbq sauce).... the waiter and waitress were very polite and getting our food didn't take too long. (The portions are a good size).

I tried the lettuce pray, it was really good.
But I didn't really like the chicken and waffles it had a strange taste. Not sure how to really explain it. But for some you'll probably love it. Unfortunately we didn't. Btw.. It's 1am and I'm at home trying to write this review and then sleep. But I can still taste the weird flavour of the chicken and waffle  :(

Anyways..... After eating the waitress come and took our plates away and got me a take-out box for my leftovers. We then asked for the bill... after some time of waiting for the waitress to come back to take our payments.... (by the way she was serving the table right beside us, and attended to them about 3-4 times. I am 110% sure she noticed my bank card and the cash on the table). I was willing to see how long it would take for her or anyone to notice us sitting there waiting to pay, I think we waited 15-20mins before my cousin said something to get her attention.

But instead of the waitress coming, I believe the manager came and said the internet wasn't working and she can only take cash (I'm a tap kinda girl. I love tapping my debit card and I never walk with cash. My friends don't like that since we do go to a lot of places that actually have a cash only sign.) So, I advised the person that I only have debit and in a RUDE response she said \"you can go to the atm over there, there is nothing I could do, the internet isn't working\".   ..........lmfao, Like what!!!?!!!!? There was no \"I'm sorry we should have stated that earlier or I apologize about the inconvenience\". Nope none. So I left my cousin in the restaurant and started to walk in the direction of \"over there\" (I turned right heading south on Main St) and walked to Scotiabank (I bank with Simplii so I had to pay a $3.00 fee). 

The bank isn't far it's just one light away. I'm just so disappointed in the service there (when the manager came and spoke that way, I knew the waitress and waiter ignored us for so long because they saw my bank card. They probably didn't want to let me know what was wrong). I still tipped 10% because at first the were so nice and attentive. BUT, I will not be going back there ever again. You guys suck! And need some customer service skills. lettuce pray for those without customer service skills so that they can get it ASAP!!

Still everyone should check it out, at least once (I will not recommend the chicken and waffles) and bring cash!  just in case.

If you want chicken and waffles go to SMASH Kitchen (  funny thing is we went to SMASH first, but there was a wait...and the hostess at SMASH called me just as we sat down at Inspire.  :'(      )"}
{"text":"Summary: Inspire Restaurant is Asian fusion done right. The menu is extremely creative. The food delivers the fusion promise. It's innovative, creative, yet simple. One of the most palatable experiences available on the Northeast end. 

Value: 3/5
Quality of Food: 5/5
Cleanliness/Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Innovation: 5/5
Overall: 4.3 

Value: There's not much to be said of value. The price range is fair, but it's not cheap nor expensive. The servings sizes are fair but not large nor small. There aren't a lot of special deals available.

Quality of Food: The most impressive thing about Inspire is the dishes the chefs have created. The INSP burger, the Chicken & Waffle, and the pulled pork Frite just to name a few, have left a big impression on me. 

Cleanliness/Atmosphere: Despite being small, the dining experience rarely feels crowded, but borders cozy. The place is very clean and well lit. Decorations are modern. A flat screen TV hangs above the bar showing loops of a fireplace. It is a pleasant experience. 

Service: Service here is excellent. Waiters and waitresses are flexible to seating requests. Despite not having reservations one time, the waitress was very accommodating and offered us alternatives to simply waiting. 

Innovation: Being a fusion restaurant, innovation is a huge factor. In the case of Inspire Restaurant, it is a huge positive factor. What i'm most impressed by their dishes is always the simplicity. The idea behind fusion food is of course, the combination of two worlds. The purpose is to create new from the old. This means at least double the possibilities. Yet in the mist of all those choices, Inspire manages to keep things simple, and easy to appreciate, all the while demonstrating utmost creativity."}
{"text":"I came for the chicken & waffle, which is as good as expected. their menu is so creative, no alike anywhere else. duck taco is delicious appetizer as well. will come back for more adventure!"}
{"text":"Okay I didn't love this place. Cool vibes, interesting concept but I didn't love the food. Like it was trying to do too much maybe? The mix of flavours didn't appeal to me. Granted I wasn't feeling great to begin with when I came here so when I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken came doused in something, it was too much for me and I don't think I had more than a bite. Great for drinks, however if I recall correctly they were quite pricey. Good spot if you're tired of the same old and want to try something new but if you're a traditionalist when it comes to your food, I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is easily the best restaurant in Markham.  With some fantastic fusion combinations, excellent desserts, Brunch on Sunday is a must!  Love this place.."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night for dinner. The restaurant is pretty small so reservations are strongly encouraged.

Everything looked tasty on the menu, but on the server's recommendation I ordered the short ribs with mushrooms. And as a starter, split a Taro Tots.

The Tots were these crispy fried balls of Taro (I think), topped with cheese, chilies and dried cranberries, and with a mayo sauce. Textures were great, and the taste was good.

The short ribs came topped with fried shredded potato and over some mashed potatoes. Once again the contrast of textures was well done. The dish was very infused with the mushroom flavours. Maybe wish there was just a bit more actual short rib.

Prices were reasonable, and service was great. Very friendly and checked up on us multiple times."}
{"text":"A second visit to this restaurant proved that everything good (it was all good) from my first visit wasn't a fluke. The food, presentation, and service were all excellent! These guys got it right!

I'll have to keep coming back until I try everything on the menu! Maybe next time I'll have room for dessert."}
{"text":"I really like Inspire's Asian take on comfort food. I had the udon carbonara; the noodles added a different dimension to this classic Italian dish. Chicken and Waffles was also very good, liked the addition of star anise in the syrup! Lastly, we also tried the inspire burger and loved how the patty was very juicy, this also came with fries which were thin and crispy! 

Reservations recommended!"}
{"text":"A great little restaurant for interesting food combinations. Limited seating so call ahead for reservations. Interesting decorations and lighting makes for a intimate and cosy atmosphere. If you are sitting next to the wood pieces, be careful of protruding nails. All dishes came piping hot, which I really appreciate. Pulled pork poutine came piled high, on the sweet side but nice app to start the meal. The best dish of the night was the udon carbonara, creamy with a bit of a spicy kick. Nuggets of sausage and chewy noodles. Macha fish and chips was okay, crispy but couldn't taste the macha."}
{"text":"The best Chicken & Waffle in town.  The chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside.  Waffle is perfectly made, with nice touch of their syrup~ YUM!!  The portion is kinda big for me, so I usually pack the rest home.  And it's still very good after I reheat it in oven at home~ LOVE IT!!!

Udon Carbonara is also my favourite, and the INSP burger.  Don't forget to have their Pulled Pork Frites~!  OMG, I've too many favourite dishes here... 

Service is good.  Their waitresses are always busy with many things, but they are very friendly and nice.

Must make reservation :-D

Heard that their Brunch menu is very good too... Definitely will come again for it!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite fusion restaurant around Markham. The environment is pretty cool as it is sophisticated but also have a twist to it cause of their decor. Love coming here and their udon carbonara is a must try dish!"}
{"text":"I like the name; INSPIRE!  Not sure what has inspired the chef to be that creative, but the dishes here have inspired my taste buds.  The udon carbonara divulges the most inspiration; thick chewy udon in rich creamy sauce.  The udon has turned the classic Italian dish into a bit Japanese; a perfect fusion carbonara.  The short rib as-is is extremely juicy and the meat comes off the bone easily.   It is more than tender, the fat that woven in the meat gives it a gelatinous texture.  The Chicken and Waffle has the most generous portion; four pieces of waffle together with three pieces of fried chicken stacking high.   The chicken is crispy, moist and it is not greasy at all.  The ginger maple syrup has given a spark to the chicken. Our server is cheerful and attentive. Great service! Everything here deserves a solid five star!!  Come here and be inspired!  **Lunch is less packed, but for dinner; reservation is a MUST!**"}
{"text":"I was skeptical due to hype of this place but I went and tried it anyway. Sat/Sun can expect a line up as the restaurant is small.  It is an asian fusion restaurant, so the menu doesn't have alot of choice, but you could see they put thoughts into it as every item comes with an asian fusion theme.  I had the waffle chicken for $15, and I don't normally eat greasy stuff, the deep fried chicken is crispy and juicy, greasy but delicious and tasty. The waffle was mediocre but a good combination with the fried chicken in my opinion.  They put a little meringue on the side which i tho was a nice touch but some ppl might find it unnecessary.  My friend ordered the Korean beef with eggs which looked really good and the beef was very tasty.  A cool new addition in the neighbourhood and definitely the place to go if you want to step away from the bar food restaurants nearby. A refreshing experience."}
{"text":"Second time here but I did not write a review for my first visit. 

The restaurant is small with few tables - I echo all the other Yelpers to call ahead and make reservations. 

I came here for brunch with two friends. No problem getting my reserved seat. 

To share: PULLED PORK FRITES Time Honored Braised Pulled Pork + Sweet Shallot Aioli + Hand Cut Yukon Gold ($8) 

Shoe tip: As you can see in my picture, the dish is constructed in separate layers so before eating, make sure to mix! You want all the components in each bite. 

-This dish comes topped with a mountain of what I believe to be fried thinly sliced taro pieces? In my opinion, it doesn't have much taste and serves to add crunch and visual appeal. 
- The pulled pork isn't doused in a barbecue sauce so it isn't sweet and you can still taste the \"porkiness.\" It was really tender. 
- The sweet shallot aioli is so tasty, it is creamy and sweet and you get that hint of onion flavour. It adds another element to the dish.
- The frites aren't the crunchiest maybe because of how it is cooked or how thin they are? Only the ends of the frites seem to retain their crunchiness - but as noted above those fried bits provide crunch.

Overall, this is very tasty and easy to share. 

My dish: SALMON CORN PANCAKES CHEESE SCRAMBLER
Maple Glazed Charred Jalapenos filled Pancakes + Spiced Pork Belly + Aged Cheddar + Scrambled Egg + Torched Salmon + Tobiko ($18)

The dish is not spicy, despite the charred jalapenos in the pancakes. Again I tried to get a bit of everything on each bite. 

There was so much flavour in each bite: 

- The salmon is charred on the outside and pretty much raw on the inside - you can definitely taste the salmon 
- Tthe spiced pork belly is tender and has a little sweetness (from a light glaze?), very good. 
- The aged cheddar in the scrambled eggs were nice (one of my favourite cheeses) 
- The pancakes I remember were easy to cut, haha. 

Great dish, nice play on salty and sweet. For the price of the dish, I think it delivered the quality and quantity. I only wish the jalapenos came through with a hint of spice. 

I also tried my friend's chicken and waffles and the korean bennies. The chicken and waffles were good, especially when you mop up some of that maple syrup. The Korean bennies were okay, I wish the steak had more of the korean marinade. The hollandaise isn't your typical hollandaise. It's different, but still good. 

Service is good, they check up on you, re-fill your water, can split your bill etc. Found the music volume a bit loud but I'm sure I could have asked to lower the volume if I wanted to..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about the food here.  We ordered a few items off the lunch menu.  Did the food taste bold?  Was there care shown in the craftsmanship? Yes to both questions.  Were the flavors unique or at least good?  Some for the first half of the question; depends for the second half cause some might find the food too salty.  

The nagging feeling I had through out the meal was I was eating a collection of appetizers.  The perception was not due to the portion, since I knew this was a tapa restaurant walking in.  The issue centered on the lack of flavors balance.  Each dish was a punch to my mouth of one bold flavor.  Each dish screamed for a balancing dish.  I took full responsibility of not balancing the flavors I chose.  Yet the organization of the menu didn't make it easy for customers to balance the dishes.  Obviously this highlights the shortcoming of tapa style dining: unlikely main entrée style or tasting menu, the onus is on customers to plan and balance the meal, whether it is ingredients, flavors, size or texture.

I say this with sincere intention to suggest improvements: reorganize the menu, highlight the mild and bold flavors separately or at least obviously, make it easier for customers to organize the meal well."}
{"text":"Great service with decadent options. Drunken crustaceans and duck tacos recommended, while coconut scallop ceviche could be improved. The fried chicken and waffles are great, but can very quickly become too rich for some (like myself.) The black bowl carbonara udon is outstanding and we will return just for this. Ample amounts of perfectly cooked protein mixed with a delicious cream-sauce udon. Tiramisu cheesecake is average while the donut ice cream waffle shines."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time dining at Inspire. I would agree with some yelpers that the restaurant was hard to find- they are located on the right side of Main Sushi. They have a little burgundy flag banner at the front of the entrance with the restaurant name.

Now let's get to the food! We ordered the Tom Yum Mussels to start, then moved to the Chicken and Waffles as well as the Udon Carbonara. We finished off our meal with a caged chocolate mousse.

The mussels was a perfect starter as suggested by our server. The broth was light but flavourful with a perfect accompaniment of 2 pieces of crispy garlicky toasts to dip into your broth. The broth had slight kick to it but not over powering. The mussels itself was juicy and fresh.

The chicken and waffles were delicious! The crispy outer skin with the juicy succulent meat.. As for the waffles it was topped with a little dollop of herb butter and drizzled with a spiced maple syrup. I can see how some people may think that there are too many flavour profile in this dish however once I had all of the components together they worked harmoniously. 

The UDON CARBONARA!!! This was a dish I could eat day in and day out! The creamy sauces balances with the savoury flavour of the chorizo and bacon! Who can say no to that! The dish also had a hint of a kick which was a nice surprise! 
 
We finished off with a caged chocolate mousse. It was a tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. If I wasn't so stuffed I would probably try their banana bread waffles. 

I definitely will be back. In fact I made a second reservation prior to leaving. 

Why I am giving this place a 4 out of 5 because service for our food was somewhat slow and the restaurant was not busy at all. Including us they only had about 6 tables. I will be trying different starters and dessert when I am back again next week. Hopefully these will change my rating slightly."}
{"text":"Very nice young people. Great food...alright al ya Tennesseans try this place when you  visit  Toronto, Canada.  Check out their Insp Burger and ribs."}
{"text":"Back today to give it another shot.

This time we ordered the INSP burger with pulled pork fries ($16+2) and the Sal and Blin (12).

According to the menu, Sal and Blin is \"Salmon Torched + Jalapeno Cheese Mini Pancakes + Papaya Slaw (lil'spice+soy mayo) + Amaranth\". It was light and delicious - an excellent appetizer. The torched salmon was excellent - could be the best I've ever had. No fishy taste, fresh and so soft. Again, Inspire likes to play with a whole lot of flavors in its food. I actually liked it better without the jalapenos. I was able to taste the different flavors so much more. They don't mention it, but there is tobiko, scallion, and fried lotus root as well. The Asian in the Asian fusion food here is in the details.

The INSP burger is a burger with tomato mayo, burger, seared pork belly, and fried egg. Surprisingly light tasting for a burger but it was good still. Only thing was our pork belly was more like pork jerky, it was tough and chewy. We mentioned this later to one of the waitresses and she was very nice about explaining that if we had told her when we found out, they would have brought us a new one. Pulled pork frites were the same as last time. Still delicious. Probably the thing I liked most.

Service felt a bit slow today - we decided quickly what we wanted but still waited at least 4-5 minutes while there was the one server for the whole restaurant right next to us just waiting by the chefs' window for another table's order. Depends on who you get for the quality of service I guess.

Still a 3.5 for me. The food was nice and interesting, but I've decided it's not quite my taste but that's just my personal preference. Definitely give it a shot though, you might like it better than I do :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Have been here a couple times now and I am impressed by the creativity and flavours here. Literally the best French fries I've ever had. Had a great burger once, and the chicken and waffles are amazing - i think they use star anise and coriander to flavour it. Only improvement could be slightly faster service as they had only one waitress working the entire room at lunch. But she was very friendly and doing her best! 

Overall excellent spot."}
{"text":"First of all, the name is perfect.  Every dish is truly inspired.  

Chicken with waffles was awesome.  There is a great flavour (I think there was fennel seeds in the crust which worked really well) and tenderness to the chicken and the waffles were good.  The Inspire burger with cheesecake was soo good...high quality beef gets paired with peameal bacon with a subtle hint of cheesecake...Decadent!  And the upgrade to pulled pork fries is well worth it if you like deliciousness.

Friendly and attentive service....like Arnold said, I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner last night and returned today for brunch.Top notch service and attentive servers.the food is amazing and make sure to try the desserts."}
{"text":"If there was a 4.5......Excellent Food. Service is OK

I read a number of reviews before going to Inspire for the first time. As I walked in the door, a candle on a small wall shelf fell and just missed my head. That surely is a sign of good things to come. After negotiating my way through the main drapes I was surprised to find an intimate zen-like experience inside.

The design is modern, warm, (except for the table near the front door), small and quaint. The left side of the space is the open kitchen and right side has wall table seating and a few small 2 tops near the kitchen wall. The hostess/waitress was pleasant enough but not exactly what I would call \"warm\". But I wasn't there to make friends with the staff. I asked for a table change and she was very accommodating. However there is s light \"edge\" on the personality side.

The food is indeed amazing....at least for the INPR Burger I had. After explaining to the waitress that it was my first time there and asking \"what should I have\", she recommended the INSP burger without hesitation. So the Chicken and Waffles had to wait for another visit. The Burger was excellent with Prime Beef, Seared Pork Belly, Fried Egg and Roasted Tomato Mayo. The combination was heavenly and not as messy as I would have thought, to eat. I selected the salad over the fries for the side and it was also excellent!

My guest had the Duck Tacos and while they are filled with Duck Confit, Cucumber Orange Salsa, and Cilantro Fennel Aioli, the reaction was somewhat less inspiring that the description. They were \"ok\". We didn't try the desserts however at $50 for two with two entrees, 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio and a tip, I thought that was great value relative to the quality of the food.

The service overall is a bit slow however there is a correlation between the quality of the food and the time it takes to prepare. If the food comes out too quickly, you might question its freshness and if its too slow, you might question the service. Overall the food delivery was acceptable. If you're in a hurry, you might be disappointed. This is not a fast food joint.

The crowd is mixed between older local diners and hipster Asian fusion foodies and perhaps the most disturbing part of our meal was the elder lady at the adjoining table that kept looking over at our meals. Perhaps that's what happens when everyone is curious about what everyone else is having. The 2 tops next to the kitchen would provide a bit more privacy.

I will definitely go back to try some other dishes. As with many good restaurants, its best to try this place when its not so busy. Reservations are must if you are intent on eating there. My recommendation on the the design is to add mirrors on the wall that guests are looking at when they sit at the bench tables. It would be great for everyone to have a full view of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Second time here but this time for dinner.

Started with the duck taco for $12. Pretty plain.
Second appetizer we got was a side of fries for $4. Just as good as the first time I remembered and probably the best dish we had all night. Yeah....the fries were the best part of the night....pretty sad.

For the entree we got the pulled pork waffle $15. Tasted okay but got boring fast.
Second entree was the udon carbonara dish for $18. Once again it tasted okay but nothing that got me excited. Very creamy and nice flavours.

Finally we were hoping the dessert would cheer us up but they took away the mini baklava cheese cake I had last time. So we settled for the cage candy chocolate mousse for $9. I thought it would at least be a mousse cake but it was literally a pile of mousse which looked like a pile of you know what. The candy shaped like a cage tasted really good though. 

Overall, not as impressed as the first time. 

Service was excellent. And for you guys out there. Attractive waitress alert. Even my sister though she was pretty :)"}
{"text":"When we went in, it was pretty empty but we decided to try something new. There were 8 of us... And how often would everyone agree that their meal was delicious? Everything was so yummy and pretty! You can tell that the chefs takes their time and put lots of love into their cooking. 

Must try their pull pork waffles $12 and pull pork fries! 
Everyone can only complement their dish and said this is by far the best place to eat Asian fusion cuisine in Markham! 

Perfect place for brunch, lunch and dinner for couples, families & friends. 
**It's really a great place that needs to be recognized. 

There was only one waitress in the restaurants but the service was still great.

 The wait time was a bit long but there's 8 of us so we can't really complain. Downside is the air vent, when they cook it's pretty stuffy."}
{"text":"Be sure to make a reservation to go to this restaurant. It is quite small, very dim but nice vibe.  We got the poutine which was very yummy. I had the udon carbonara, very tasty. My husband had the loco moco and he enjoyed it as well. Hoping to come back for chicken and waffles soon!  I am writing this review after going a few months later so my memory reminds me still the food was good!"}
{"text":"I think it's a little over rated. My cousin recommended to me so I came as I live nearby. U need to book at least a week in advance so my husband and I had high expectation. Food is not bad but not as grand as we thought. We ordered waffle chicken and the udon carbonara I like the latter one. The waffle was soggy as they soaked with maple syrup, maybe it was meant to be but not my favor. We ordered the mango sakinini and the apple cider drink both r so so. The dessert was better. We ordered the banana bread waffle with peanut butter ice cream and some chocolate thing. It's heavy must share. Will I come back? Highly unlikely."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was great! Restaurant was beautiful! Chicken and Waffles are a must!!! The menu is amazing! Fusion at its finest! I recommend this place to anybody looking for great food with a cool twist!"}
{"text":"Having read great reviews on Yelp about Inspire, we decided to give this place a try for Saturday brunch.

Call me a hipster but I love cross-cultural fusion when it is done right, which is definitely the case here. I appreciate their creative uses of ingredients. Who knew that cumin and saffron could go so well with hash potatoes and that pork belly and poached eggs make a great duo.

I had the Eggs Bennies which I devoured with gumption. My fiancé, following my recommendation (mainly so I could steal his fries), ordered the INSP burger with duck confit fries. My fiancé found the duck confit to be too salty but I choose to overlook that because our waters were filled regularly. He loved his burger though!

We were quite full after that so dessert was not an option which is unfortunate because everything on the menu seems unique (including the desserts). It's not crazy to want to try everything on the menu eventually. I got my eyes on Chicken & Waffle, as well as Butter Chicken Serpentini for our next visit."}
{"text":"Inspire restaurant is a unique little gem in Markham. There's really nothing like it and I appreciate the restaurant for it's Asian Fusion menu as they have some interesting items on the menu. The restaurant itself isn't too big but the atmosphere is nice and cozy. The food itself is another story. I think the dishes are hit and miss. Some dishes are really good and some I could live without. The pricing seems a bit high for the portion size as well so hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Oh finally and awesome brunch place in Markham!  Everything here is uniquely made and has a fusion/creative touch to it!  The service is very friendly the two times I've been here and food is excellent. 

The pulled pork frites are a must try and the chicken and waffles are a must as well!  Everything else that I've had there has been very tasty as well.  Their INSP burger was a bit on the oily side but I'm very picky about how my bun is after the meat touches it and I personally found it a bit too oily and soggy for my liking.  However, everything has been absolutely delicious.  

I definitely want to come back here to try dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a large group here a couple of weeks ago. We got there a bit before noon as it is a small space. It's cozy though, with nice clean washrooms.

Service was good with our water glasses constantly replenished and no issues. Lots of excellent food at our table. We shared some of the butter crustaceans which were delicious. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles which was a huge lunch portion and a great value. The chicken was excellent and the waffles good.

Most of the lunch portions were huge. Next time I may try the beef salad as it looked and apparently tasted great."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Yup, the second highest rated restaurant in Markham has reasons to be so. Inspire is definitely one of the most unique restaurants I've been to, and honestly given the price it was definitely not as costly as I thought.

I visited Inspire with my parents during Fathers Day, and booked a reservation at 8pm. I honestly didn't need to have reserved, because throughout the time I was there the place never reached full capacity.

We ordered the duck taco, seafood paella, udon carbonara, banana leaf salmon, Indonesian chicken rendang, and the caged chocolate mousse. Each dish was uniquely crafted, and each had their excellent unique taste as well. However, I did somewhat wish the flatbread used for the duck taco was thinner, because it was quite thick. The caged chocolate mousse was definitely one I didn't expect in terms of its creation, and one that I highly recommend for dessert.

Service was really good, and the waitresses kept refilling our glasses of water, as well as asking us whether our dishes were up to standard. I also noticed looking at other reviews that the menu changes often, so I would definitely revisit here to try some new unique items!"}
{"text":"A fun little place in Markham on main street - just north of highway 7.
Make reservations for busy periods.

Arugula salad wasn't great - pulled pork waffles are decent.
Banana bread waffles tasted good and the pepper cheesecake was also great!

Staff and interior was pretty nice.

Overall worth a visit."}
{"text":"Small local restaurant on mainstreet Markham. They serve a great menu of fusion dishes, and have excellent service which makes Inspire an awesome eat. 

We had the udon carbonara and the duck fries. The duck fries came as a generous portion and were topped nicely with strips of duck meat. The udon carbonara had lots of flavour and the toppings were stellar. I'd come back just for this dish! Service was fantastic, I felt like I was in a higher end restaurant because of it. They also have quite a drink selection.

I'd come back!"}
{"text":"First to start off the place is really small. I wanted to try this place for a long time so finally I came. I had the inspire burger with duck Confit fries. The burger was so crispy with a spicy kind of sauce and it was seasoned perfectly.  The fries were probably one of the best fries I ever had in my life.  They actually had duck meat in them. It is bit on the pricey side but the food was absolutely delicious. I like the fusion kind of concept definetly make reservations if you will go to this place."}
{"text":"Inspire was widely recommended by friends and other Yelpers so I decide to choose this place to eat for my anniversary dinner. When entering restaurant, we noticed that the restaurant was really small and tight. I noticed the decor in the restaurant felt really cheap and they tried to imitate the feeling of a loft with exposed pipes. Came on a Wednesday night thinking it won't be super busy. Turns out all tables were reserved except two small tables near their counter area. So we got seated at the small tables. It was a tight space but it functioned. The waiter was nice and brought us water right away. The service was so far so good. What really drove down this rating was the food. 

Ordered: Chicken and Waffles, Indonesian Chicken Rendang and the INSP Burger. Did not order desserts because we felt sick after our entrees. The best part was the chicken and waffles as this actually tasted decent. But the burger was so oily that it made my partner almost throw up. Also, my Rendang dish tasted so mediocre that it tasted nothing special. It was also very oily. 

All in all, everything except the Chicken and Waffles was so oily that it gave me and my partner heart burn. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't return to this restaurant ever again. This restaurant is just mediocre in my books and now I realize how overhyped this place is. Highly do not recommend."}
{"text":"Totally surprised by our visit vs other reviews. Had reservations for brunch on a Sunday and had to wait for 15 minutes for our table despite the reservation. 3 of us shared chicken and waffles, uni pancake and Hanoi beef salad. The chicken and waffles and the uni pancakes were both disappointing. Pancakes were just too dry and the chicken was way over cooked in the waffles. Portions for the waffle were also quite small. The Hanoi salad was actually quite good. We had heard so many good things about this place we drove up from downtown. Not worth going to if u lived next door."}
{"text":"Very inspiring food for Markham!! This place gets very busy on weekends and rightly so. The food is very very good, and it is fusion (for the purists out there). We ordered as much as we could for six people and almost every dish was yum! The highlights for me were the udon carbonara, the poke bowl, and the duck tacos. We were incredibly full after. Friendly staff, good service, cozy atmosphere. The place is small so you must book in advance. 

My only problem was actually making it there. They made it very difficult for a group of 7 to book a reservation. It took about 4 phone calls, to the point I almost gave up. Couldn't book with the person who answered the phone, 7 (6 adults + a toddler) were too many people, I was told the manager would have to call me back. Then the same person called me back and said that I had to come by in person ahead of time, meet with the manager, and use my credit card to book a table. I have no problem using my cc to reserve, but they could not do it over the phone. And of course the manager is the only one authorized to use the cc machine! I was told many unnecessary stories about why they don't book \"large\" parties such as they're being sabotaged someone who cancels big bookings. As well as \"because they're No. 1 in Markham\" someone is trying to ruin them. All things I didn't need to know, I just wanted to book. Eventually the next day the manager called me back and I was able to book over the phone with my cc. Never had to do this before in any restaurant in the GTA or downtown. Very disappointing before even getting there. 

Lucky for them the food was amazing and it saved them from a bad review. Maybe I am an idiot for giving them a chance but being in Markham I really did want to support them. Hopefully this review will make them manage bookings a little better, and train their staff to handle phone calls in a more professional manner.

To the chef: keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"I don't get why Smash gets all the love for good spots in Unionville because Inspire is much better. It's quieter than Smash (i.e., easy to miss with its simple sign, a much smaller - and cozier - space), but its food speaks volumes. We got:
- Chicken and Waffles: I looooooove chicken and waffles, and this one was really good. They were pretty generous with their serving, making it a waffle sandwich (i.e., waffles on both the top and bottom of the chicken), and had 4 sizeable chicken pieces. I usually like mine simple with just maple syrup but Inspire had it with a berry sauce. I had my doubts whether that would work, but it definitelt did, with the tartiness complementing the chicken and waffles really well. 
- Inspire Burger: The burger was huge and the taste was pretty good (pork belly and fried egg on it were nice touches), so overall an ok dish and you get value for money. The interesting thing was the pulled pork fries we got with it. The pork was standard but they put this veggie slaw thing that made it interesting. Can't decide whether it made it better or worse actually, but interesting for sure.
- Kahlua tiramusu cheesecake: So good! If you're the type who likes to taste the cheese chunks in a cheesecake (versus it tasting just like smooth cream), go for this. The Kahlua flavour also definitely came through. 

Other notes: Service was fine, place had the right mix of an energetic vibe but quiet enough to have good conversations, and parking on the street and in a backlot are readily available. Highly recommend trying Inspire out."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation for two for 6pm and realized restaurant opens for dinner just then. It was a bit weird to have to wait outside to go into restaurant given we had arrived and expected to be seated at 6pm. Seating is limited here and service was slow. 

However, food was delicious. The taco appetizer was a great recommendation by the server. We had the udon carbonara and chicken and waffles as entrees which were very nicely plated and tasty. 

Overall, food was great but experience could have been better."}
{"text":"Came here due to a recommendation by a friend. It's a bit out of the way from my usual spots for food but I am glad I made the small journey.

Situated in the beautiful Main Street Markham, this restaurant is nested among historic buildings and boutique shops.

The food here is visually stunning and extremely tasty. They have a great fusion theme and they combine ingredients that you don't normally see together into something truly special.

A cute side note, they buy special beer and sell them as \"surprise me\" - a nice little differentiator that is a testimonial to their core value to be innovative and delightful."}
{"text":"That time we ordered 2 appetizers and 5 entrees for a birthday brunch for 4 people! Haha I love this place! While wait time for a table is usually a problem for this place, but we made reservations so we were seated right away today. The highlight was the panko scotched eggs, spot on as per usual. My entree, the eggs bennies with chili hollandiase sauce and honey glazed pork belly was very good. Though a little too many flavors, the soft poached eggs were cooked perfectly. And we loved the chicken and waffle, banana bread French toast, and Korean steak and eggs as well! Would go back for brunch again!"}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT 10/10.  Small location with limited seating,  must book in advance.  Chicken n Waffle, the chicken is not as crispy as I like but still amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times so here's my overall review for all the times I've visited. 

In terms of location, it is very small and tiny - probably holds about 10 tables. Seating is pretty confined since tables are so close together. Make sure you book reservations*

The first few times I've went here, they had great service (probably because they were still relatively new) but over the months, their service has been declining... slow service and inattentive staff. There was this one time, my friend and I were finished lunch so we asked for water and the bill and it took 4 requests... not impressed. 

I will say that the food definitely outweighs the service which is why it is one of my favourite places to dine at. They offer my favourite foods under one roof - fried chicken + waffles, burgers and Asian fusions. It's hard to pinpoint which is my favourite dish as all of them taste SO GOOD. Each person I've brought to this place has not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of fusion but I will make an exception for this place.

Pros:
Food is prepared very well
Excellent service

Cons:
Menu is a little limited

Another place my GF has wanted to try for a while.  Like I said, I'm usually not a fan of fusion so I had my reservations about the place.  Sometimes though, it's a good thing to be wrong.  

This place is a great place to take a date.  It's dimly lit and has a warm feeling throughout.  There are limited seats and the place is pretty busy most of the time.  If you're coming on a weekend, definitely make a reservation.  

The menu is fairly simple, everything fits on a double sided sheet of paper.  They have some appetizers to share, a couple of mains and burgers.  My GF got the chicken and waffles and I go the INSP burger with a side of duck confit fries. 

My GF really enjoyed her chicken and waffles. The chicken was done very well.  It was a little syrupy for my liking but I did like the taste of the chicken very much.  The INSP burger was amazing.  They cook their burgers here medium rare but that's a good thing for me.  The burger comes with pork belly and a fried egg which makes for a bit of messy goodness.  The duck confit fries were amazing!!  Some of the better fries I've ever honestly.

The service provided here was very good as well.  The waitress (I think her name is Vanessa) was excellent.  She is well known to the other patrons who are most likely regulars.  She was very friendly and makes you feel like you're one of the regulars even if you aren't.

The only thing with this place is the limited menu.  If you don't like burgers and not a fan of the 2-3 other entrees they may have, you're a little out of luck.  The menu doesn't have too much variety but what they serve, the do very well.

I'm defnietly a fan of this place.  It's been a couple of days since I had those fries and I've been craving them since."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try out this place now I finally did!!! Good choice! (Pat on the back)...Food are amazing! My family and I ordered the Insp burger which is trully delicious. It has prime rib and pork belly and fried  egg, really good combination. We also had the double bacon cheeseburger that has the matcha cheesecake which at first we were hesitant to try, this is really good too!!! The chicken waffle very tasty and crispy. Not a fan of spicy berry compote though...and waff out loud has waffle with steak and chicken, the steak was cook to perfection. Finally the Insp loco moco, love love the coconut flavored rice and prime rib steak mix.

Ambience is cozy and nice. Staff are very friendIy. Food serving are huge. Seems like a restaurant in downtown Toronto but its close to home.  Glad i made reservation ahead of time. I would defintely come back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night around 6:30 pm and we were promptly seated. Before coming here, I went through the reviews and I already knew what I was going to get before looking at the menu.

We started off with pulled pork frites (time honored braised pulled pork + sweet shallot aioli + hand cut yukon gold) - $8. I thought that this dish was delicious especially with the aioli sauce but it wasn't something I've never had before. Nonetheless, it was still a very delicious dish.

Next, we tried the udon carbonara (spicy chorizo + braised beef + honey mushrooms in creamy white wine reduction topped with quail egg) - $18. The waitress kindly offered some fresh cracked pepper on the noodles but good thing I declined because it already had a lot of pepper in it! For the first half of the dish, it was very good but near the end, it got incredibly salty. Overall, the noodle was a perfect consistency and I liked the sauce.

Lastly, we had chicken and waffle (crisp chicken + fresh homemade waffle + fresh berries + meringue kisses + ginger maple) - $15. To me, I thought they used regular maple syrup; I didn't realized they used ginger maple. The chicken was boneless and perfectly crisp. The waffle was on the mediocre side.

I wanted to try their desserts but we were too full! I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"So I'm usually not a fan of \"Asian Fusion\" restaurants but upon reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  This was all a part of what my friend and I call our \"Food Adventures\".  The two of us love, I mean LOVE food.  We happened to be in the area, so we needed somewhere to eat and this is one of the places I came upon.  I was intrigued by their burgers because they looked and sounded delicious.  My friend ordered the Far East Burger (prime beef patty, pineapple salsa, tomato mayo and the usual burger fixings on a brioche bun) with fries and I ordered the Korean burger (prime rib steak, pickled cucumbers on a French baguette) with pulled pork fries (it also has crispy taro sticks, green onions, cucumber and mayo on top).  Let me tell you...we were starving and couldn't wait to get out food, but it was definitely worth the wait!!  My friend and I cut our burgers in half so that we could each try the other's.  The brioche bun was toasted to perfection!  It was crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. Everything about her burger was amazing and tasty!  I absolutely loved my Korean burger because all of the flavours came together nicely.  I especially loved their pulled pork fries!!! The fries are thin and crispy and I love the toppings!!!  My friend and I wanted to finish everything on our plates, but we were just too full.  Next time, we definitely want to try their chicken and waffles because everyone seemed to be ordering it around us. We just need to remember to bring some more friends because the portion is so big (4 waffles and 4 pieces of fried chicken)!  This is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Hard to get a table, but food is innovative and very good value. The coco raspberry is a must try (cocktail), really good brunch, love the korean beef sandwich. Fries with toppings are good, both the duck and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Hey this is probably one of the best place for an asain fusion meal. Great food and relaxed place"}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday afternoon right when it opened and we were the first ones there. We ordered from the lunch menu, and the food was incredible! We had the loco moco, and the beef patty was cooked just right. The shitake mushroom sauce paired perfectly with the patty and the coconut rice. The salmon in the salmon pancakes  melted as soon as I put it in my mouth. The jalapeño pancakes were interesting, but I wasn't much of a fan. Parking is pretty hard to find, so its best to come on a weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to come here for some time. Told my friend this place had amazing reviews so he came too! Made reservations as suggested. When I called, they only had the bar left. Upon walking in, there were 3-4 tables empty. I asked if we could be seated at a table, but they were all booked! 

Started off with the duck fries because upon reading reviews, it's a must. However, we did not like it. Since the fries come in a ball, they're soggy. I also dislike how they're thin but brown (like well overcooked instead of a perfect golden). The fries were just not good... The toppings on it were good. We both agreed that they should have put more sauce since that was really the best part. Also the duck in the center was not oily/greasy like duck usually is so that was a pleasant surprise. Our suggestion to those getting the duck fries: mix before eating. All the yummy stuff is on top, and a dense ball of duck meat is in the center.

I got the INSP loco moco. I was expecting the beef to be a steak like cut but it was like a hamburger patty. A plain, dense/lean, and burnt hamburger patty. I felt as if there was no seasoning at all in it and did not enjoy the char, texture, or anything about it at all. I wish it wasn't there but it was supposed to be the star of the dish??? Aside from that, the rice underneath was soooo good. I loved how juicy the shitake mushrooms were. The flavour of the sauce was smooth, complex, and rich in flavour. I really enjoyed that. I also liked the crunchy taro chips on top! It was unique and a great compliment to the creamy rice. The shrimp were also huge and juicy!

My friend got the udon carbobara which I got to try. The noodles were thick and wonderfully cooked. The creamy sauce held each noodle well, making it very flavourful. I would choose this dish over mine and say it was the best one we got.

Even though I came in really hungry, the food filled me up quickly. I took a lot of leftovers home. The portions are large and I found the price to be quite fair for the quality! I would come again on a special occasion to try other dishes.

They also have a dessert menu but I didn't take a look.

The cucumber infused water is better than lemon!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing some solid reviews about the dinner, but left a bit disappointed. 

We arrived at our reservation time and was seated quickly at a small table near the bar and got the duck frites, duck confit tacos, and the hunter gatherer sandwich. 

The duck frites ($8) were good, even though it was evident that it had been sitting out for a bit (the fries were cold and a tad stale), but they were dressed well with mayo, spring onions and crispy chips. Pretty filling, and at an alright price for the portion. 

The duck confit ($12) was a little disappointing. The two tacos were soggy at the bottom despite arriving well before anything else, and had probably been sitting at a counter. The duck was cold, chewy, and had difficulty staying together. I don't mind a good duck taco, but duck confit has the duck poached whole for 4-10h, and the taco shouldn't be advertised as the French dish when it tasted like simple roasted duck. The tacos were advertised to be seasoned with an 'orange salsa', but was mostly chunks of pear/apple with a few pieces of clementine that had been crushed and bled onto the soft shell taco. The flavours weren't too bad, but the dish was underwhelming. 

The hunter gatherer ($20) is a sandwich with egg, a pork patty (seasoned with lemongrass and similar flavours), and a curry soft shell crab. Crab was breaded and fried in a curry batter, which is disappointing considering how delicate the flavours of crab are, and how they were drowned out by lemongrass (the main flavour of the sandwich), and dehydrated from the batter. Portion of the crab itself was also small, and I felt like I was paying for the sake of having crab in the sandwich instead of a sandwich that was deliberately crafted around the seafood. Price was overinflated for the sandwich. 

The restaurant had nice decor and great service, but the food was underwhelming. It felt as if all the food trends were on the menu for the sake of being there instead of serving good food. Left disappointed. 

TL;DR: Restaurant seems to serve trendy ingredients in a single dish for the sake of it instead of serving complimentary flavours in a dish and felt pretentious and overpriced. Good service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't give this the best of ratings. We waited a bit to be seated even when they were several (unreserved) tables. The waitress stood at the kitchen food pick up for a good 5 minutes before noticing us. After we were seated we ordered the salmon pancakes and the signature burger with pulled pork fries. The fries were really good, the pancakes were overpowered by the spices (the torched salmon on top was nice though). The burger was good too, but the pork belly that came inside it was incredibly dry, to the point if was actually on par with jerky."}
{"text":"If you love lattes, don't order one here - it's not that special (minimal selection of sugars and only 2% milk). I think their specialty is the cocktails but I didn't feel like a drink this morning. On the other hand, the scotch egg is to die for. I like it over the one I had at Four Seasons anyway. The breading has juicy minced meat within which makes it so savoury with a piece of seaweed between egg and meat, and the sauce it's served with is great (a bit sweet a bit sour). There is some shredded radish for texture and we think some marinated blueberries. We came here because they offer chicken and waffles, so let's get to that. I personally prefer my waffle a bit crispier but here is a bit softer. The chicken is quite breaded, I prefer a lighter breading. My partner really enjoyed this dish so maybe it's just my preferences. The syrup is already on the plate all over, I prefer less sweet so I would order it on the side (I love the one at Moroco Chocolat in yorkville which has a bacon infused maple syrup). Also got the butter chicken serpentini (swirly macaroniish type of pasta). This one killed it for me. It has a robust flavour and a mild gradual heat to it, served with fennel as a garnish. Plenty of sauce, some veges in there too. Chicken is tender and juicy. I would definitely return to try other menu items. Reservations probably a good idea - we walked in and got a table but might be luck. I love the ambiance.. for a smaller place the decor is nice and the music is sexy (soft edm/lounge). The server didn't know how to describe the items in too much detail so this is not their forte. Food is great. Go."}
{"text":"Inspire has been on our radar for a while now and we were able to check it out finally for our Friday night date night dinner .

Its a casual, hip Asian fusion restaurant combining popular Western pub food with an Asian twist.

The standout for us was the Inspire Burger.   A fantastic juicy chopped beef served with a spicy mayo, Asian slaw and a fried egg on a lightly toasted bun.  It was absolutely delicious and I could have eaten this all night long!

The chicken and waffles was really nicely done as well as the drunken crustacean and the pulled pork poutine...but seriously I keep on thinking about that burger!!

Service was fantastic as the staff are constantly filling water and asking how everything was.

Definitely a great place to check out on Markham Main Street.  I've definitely been \"inspired\" especially after that burger!"}
{"text":"You need reservations to come here!
Im thinking, how busy can this place be?? What is so good about this place? Why do i need reservations a week or two in advance??

I found out last Saturday!

I went in with some higher expectation because of the reservation part, and this place sure lived up to it.

Awesome customer service!! Not once did i have to ask for water refill. This was over a 2hour span.
The water served is not plain water. Its with cucumbers and mint. What a nice surprise that was!!

I tried the chicken and waffle. The chicken lived up to the hype!i had the inspire burger and duck fries. The burger was good! There was suppose to be seared pork belly in the burger, it looked a bit more like white meat chicken which kinda threw the texture off. I didnt like it. They may have to delete that ingredient from the burger. There is something about a juicy great tasting burger, and biting into something that taste like chicken white meat kind of ruined it. So i picked it out of my burger.
The duck fries, looked great, the duck shavings were a bit dry. So i didnt enjoy this as much as i hoped.

The little things count! Just like the single hand towels in the washrooms. Wonderful idea!! 

Overall was a great experience!
Once again, the service was superb. All 3 wait staff came around to fill my water, i didnt just get 1 server, i got 3 servers that night.

5stars for sevice!
4 stars overall."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out for a while. Ended up being a solid 4 star restaurant. Great place for a dinner date or a small foodie gathering.  

I like this place because the menu isn't standard. I believe it changes slightly from time to time and this place has a good kitchen and operation team.

Made a RSVp for 5 at 8:30 on a Tuesday night.  Place had a cozy ambience and attentive staff.

Started off with 4 appetizers.. duck taco, coconut shrimps, panko eggs, and pulled pork fries.  I must say all the appetizers were great, our favourite being the pulled pork fries. Super flavourful and nicely plated. I also really liked the panko eggs but all were very delicious!

My main course was a Bacon Burger with Cheesecake. Super tasty!! A nice size homemade beef patty, peameal bacon, and cheesecake in between a bun!  Peameal was crispy, Cheesecake remind me of turkey stuffing, beef was juicy and the marinate/spices stood out.  Pretty good!

The steak waffle and pulled pork waffle was okay in our opinion.."}
{"text":"I suggest booking via phone or leaving a message. I've emailed them before to reserve and they never got back to me. Other than that, their food tastes delicious. We ordered the chicken and waffles, udon carbonara, and the pulled pork fries. I would highly recommend any of those dishes. The waitresses were nice and attentive throughout dinner. This is our second time here and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch n it wasnt busy, seems only one chief n one server. We ordered insp burger with pull pork fries n chicken waffles. The food came fast n taste good. They do care details on everything even water with a mint leaf in the water bottle which impressed me because it goes well with the food better then lemon which I agreed as well."}
{"text":"Food is great, service and atmosphere is great. Restaurant is small so make sure you make reservations during peak hours."}
{"text":"That sweet chick is delicious! I like the water too. The menu option is little, only 2 pages."}
{"text":"Arrived at Inspire for a quick brunch on a weekend and it was already half occupied within 15 minutes of the opening time. 

We got the Duck Confit Frites, the Beef Salad, and the Chicken Waffle. 

The Duck Fries were so good! It was also recommended by our waitress. She mentioned that it was one of the signature dishes. Chicken Waffle wasn't bad either. The Salad was surprising filling and delicious. 

Want to come back to try their Udon on their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Make reservations???

Disappointment!! 
We had made reservation for 6 people for 8:15pm
On a Saturday! Showed up at the restaurant.. and told us they don't have us down.. than sent us away because they are fully booked and won't make any arrangements to fit us in.

Please triple check with them in the future if thinking of eating here!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing! I was a bit hesitant because the menu was very different but after eating at many of the local places around Main Street I can say this is the best restaurant in this area by far. The quality, taste and portion size was all perfect. Definitely a place to try for something new. I had the butter chicken penne and my husband had a burger. They were both awesome."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been meaning to try Inspire out for awhile, and we finally were able to do so. I ordered chicken and waffles for main and their pok? salmon bowl for appetizer. Since the pok? bowl was only an appetizer, it was expected that it would be small, but for $13 I do not know if I'll do it again, because I have had better pok? bowls elsewhere. None the less, it was still fairly well made. As for the chicken waffles, I will more than likely go back just for that. IT. WAS. SO. GOOD. Something about the spicy berry compote with the ginger maple and the waffles made me want to lick the plate. I definitely recommend this place for their chicken and waffles, my friends also got the INSP burger which looked and tasted really good too - so if I do ever come back I'll probably try different things on their menus.

If it's one thing you have to keep in mind before going it would be making reservations especially if you're a big group because it's not a huge restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy chicken kung pao spicy cinnamon chow mein meng!!!!!!! This place was da bomb!!! Chicken and waffles all day errrrday!!!!! Will be back for the inspire burger and fries next time. Thought I could get it as well but was stuffed with scrumpCHHHHEEEdoooodaLeeeEEEEE!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it here. I cannot wait to be back again even though it's so damn far. Reservations definitely recommended. I would say book at least 2-3 days prior for a table of 4. 

Pulled pork fries: Shared this with my group. Very tasty and yummy. I'm not even a meat person but it was delish! 

Udon Carbonara: This was my main and it was absolutely amazing. Super tasty and creamy and got a little kick of spice. Yummm!! Not sure if the price was worth it ($19) but it was certainly filling. Though not filling enough to need to pack home. 

Chicken & Waffle: Sampled a little of this and imho it was better than the kind I had in NYC. I loved the syrup for this. Chicken was nice and crispy. 

Hope they open another location soon. Service was great and we didn't have a problem. They kept refilling our water and asked if everything was alright."}
{"text":"Inspire is a great restaurant located on Main Street Markham. Their menu is very unique by taking a fusion of many different cultures. Service is prompt and friendly. Food is absolutely delicious. We came with a group of 5 so we were able to try a good portion of the menu.

We started with the Duck Confit Fries with a kimchi mayo and chili peppers. This was so good. The fries tasted like duck and the mayo complemented the fries really well. 

Next was the Soft Shell Crab Pakora. Being a fan of pakora, this was an interesting take using soft shell crab. The crab was nice and crispy and came with a hot sauce and mint jelly. The sauce was pretty spicy and the mint jelly really helps to offset the heat.

The entrees we got were the Udon Carbonara, Banana Leaf Salmon, Salmon Burger, Chicken Waffles and Pulled Pork 'Grilled Cheese' Pizza Pie.

The Chicken and Waffles and Pulled Pork Pizza pie were very similar. They both contain a good balance of sweet and salty. 

The Udon Carbonara was really good. The cream sauce wasn't heavy and using udon instead of spaghetti was a simple substitution.

The Banana Leaf Salmon and Salmon Burger both have a fresh piece of salmon and are nicely seasoned. 

Overall a really great restaurant in Markham and highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's a nice little restaurant tucked along Main Street. I went there in mid November on a date and it definitely impressed her (more than me). I ordered egg benedict while she ordered a burger. The food is fine and priced reasonably but the atmosphere is just ok. Even though we were sitting quite far away from the entrance, we could feel the cold air coming in whenever someone opens the door. The seating inside was a bit cramped. When we arrived at 12pm, the server said we could only sit for 90 mins because someone reserved our table afterwards. While we didn't get asked to leave, it definitely ruined the occasion a bit as we both felt somewhat rushed. The decor inside seemed to lack consistency and appeared to be hastily put together"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about inspire and its lived up to its reputation! 

We had the Salmon burger which comes with Atlantic Salmon, minced pickled ginger aioli, shallots and avocado for $18 and $2 for the upgrade of my fries to the pulled pork fries. The salmon burger was pretty delicious and you can taste the ginger wasn't too over powering which was good. The salmon was fried just perfectly so it wasn't dry but still juicy and didn't fall apart too much in the burger. I enjoyed the pulled pork fries more because it came with some mixture of a mayo sauce and some topping that resembles raw instant noodle and it was AWESOME.

We also had the Indonesian Chicken Rendang which comes with coconut curry and roti for $22. The roti was cooked perfectly, thought the rice was somewhat dry and crunch which I didn't like. Everything else was made perfectly like the curry and the chicken, wished they had a spicy option for the curry though!

This is a small asian fusion place that was slightly busy when we arrived but we had reservations. The service is pretty good and I'll definitely be back here again to try something new on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'd give this 4.5 stars but because it's not often a cute yummy place gets added to Main St. Markham, I'm rounding up! Very glad this cute place is so close to where I live! 

I came here for Sunday brunch and got a chance to try their Peking duck cornbread pancakes for $14. Mmmmm. The plating was pleasing to the eye and the dish itself was yummy. Cornbread was great and not too overpowering, perfect mix between cornbread and pancake. The duck is not actually like how Peking duck should be, and was more cooked like a pork belly kind of way, but I think I like this more on top of pancakes. Asian fusion done at its best. Can't wait to try the chicken and waffles (my friend ordered this and it looked amazing and had said it tasted just as good) and the baklava cheesecake the next time I come! 

It gets pretty packed right when they open at 1130am on Sundays, so try to make reservations if you can to avoid a wait, especially since the place itself cannot seat too many people. 

There's also a mini parking lot right beside the restaurant to the right (it may be hard to find for those coming from hwy; my friend didn't know about this and street parked instead)"}
{"text":"Cute little Main Street Markham restaurant lives up to the Yelp hype. Went for breakfast with my sister. Service was fast and friendly. We asked for green tea to start. It was served in the most beautiful tea cups I've seen in a while (I should have asked where they obtained such lovely wares). 
The meals were plentiful, eye-catching and best of all - delicious. I've been on a real chicken and waffles kick as of late - so I ordered that. The chicken was brined and battered to perfection. Waffles were savoury. A great choice. 
My sister enjoyed the Panko Scotch Egg and Duck Taco. 
It's a great little place for brunch. I'll be sure to return to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Service and food has always been slow everytime ive been here. A party of 6 had to wait 40mins for out entree which i dont understand because the restaurant was half empty.
 Food looked nice thank god. 
Ordered the striploin, i dont get the cold puree, udon carbonara was really good. The surf and turf meatballs horrible, tasteless and just a waste. Scoth eggs hard boiled egg overcook but good flavor, softshell crab was ok. Duck taco is good."}
{"text":"Interesting combination of international cuisine in a dish. Chicken waffle was nice. Deck taco and udon carbonara was very good. Nice service. But would be better to bring some new dishes in"}
{"text":"I came here on Dec 30th for my birthday dinner. Sadly, this restaurant was a disappointment. I had high expectations for Inspire, so maybe that's why it fell short. I was excited to eat here, specifically for the cool looking desserts and delicious pastas. I was looking at photos here on Yelp and on Instagram, and let me warn you - their menu is small and apparently always changing. It was probably my fault for not checking beforehand what was available on the menu the night I went. We came exactly 8 minutes before our reservation, and felt like the waitress wasn't as friendly as she should've been... She told us we were \"early\" and they have not set up yet. We didn't have to wait long, but I felt like the worker was not very welcoming. Anyway, I ordered the udon carbonara, which was AMAZING. One of the best udon dishes I've ever tasted. Besides that, I wasn't really interested in anything else that was on the menu that night. I wanted to get the butter chicken pasta but that was not on the menu. There weren't many drink options, and the waitress was not helpful when I asked her for a recommendation. 

So the main reason why I'm giving this place only 2 stars is for the service. Me and my boyfriend were waiting for our main dish to arrive for AT LEAST 35 minutes. When we placed our orders (2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 mains) the drinks and appetizers came in a timely fashion. The waitress asked us if we needed anything else or if we were okay for now, and my boyfriend asked her if we could have ALL the food together. We wanted to wait for all the dishes to arrive before eating & taking a photo of the food (lol). Regardless of how silly my reasoning is for wanting the dishes together, we were clear when we told her we wanted all the food together. What made the situation worse, was the fact we were obviously waiting but she didn't know we were. We were literally sitting there for over 35 minutes doing nothing, not eating. We had no clue that our waitress didn't understand us when we said we wanted all the dishes now (rather than waiting for us to finish the appetizer). We kept looking around and were increasingly getting impatient. Our appetizer is STILL untouched, making it quite obvious we were waiting for the other dishes... Me and my boyfriend assumed it was taking long because he had ordered a steak, but no. It was because she didn't understand us when we said to bring the rest of the food. I completely get that it's a longer wait for the mains, but she literally did not get the memo that we wanted the mains and was waiting for us to finish the appetizer. When the waitress finally comes to us she asks if we wanted the chef to start making our mains. Um... YES..? I thought that's what we were just waiting 35 minutes for! So after some more waiting we got our food. My boyfriend's steak dish was average and the udon was fantastic. 

The dessert was the last disappointment. They only had 3 desserts on the menu and none of the ones I was eyeing online were there. No big deal though so we ordered this white dessert with caged sugar, and were still looking forward to that. A few minutes later she comes back and tells us it ran out. The restaurant wasn't even closing soon; major let down that the only dessert with the sugar cage ran out. The other options did not appeal to me so we didn't order any dessert, and got the bill instead. The service wasn't good in my opinion... I felt so bad for my boyfriend because he told me he asked the waitress to put a sparkler for my birthday, and she agreed - but then we didn't even end up getting dessert at all. Overall this place was a disappointment, although the udon noodles were spectacular. Good job to the chefs."}
{"text":"Made the trek up to Markham with my mom for a nice brunch

My mom and I noticed that the interior had no real theme to it. It felt like it was a bunch of designs pieced together with no real thought.

We started off with a Hanoi Chilled Beef Salad, which was not very good. The beef was extremely tasty, but the salad itself was below average. My mom got the INSP Burger and she said that it was average. However, the fries with the mayo sauce was extremely good. I got the Chicken and Waffles and it was probably the best version of chicken and waffles that I ever had. The waffles were fresh while the chicken was hot and covered in maple syrup. On top was a berry jam which was also tasty.

Overall, nice little brunch place, but nothing special. The other menu items looked interesting and I would come back and try them, but the trek up to Markham is just too far"}
{"text":"My bff recommended me this place so I decided to go check it out. We arrived there at around 10pm on a Friday and it wasn't busy.

We were greeted and seated promptly as soon as we arrived. The waitress asked us if it's our first time here and introduced us some popular starters and main dishes. She was very attentive and checked up on us every once in a while.

We got the buttered shrimp for appetizer ($14). The shrimp was buttery, not too much that overpowers the taste of the shrimp. 

For main, I got the udon carbonara ($18/19). To my surprise, it was pretty small. It was a bit of disappointment as it's not worth the price. On a positive note, it was pretty good - there was a quail egg on top! 

This restaurant is a cozy place to eat and hangout. Food here is mid priced so it won't break your wallet!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for friend dates and date dates...but make sure to call ahead. Don't expect walk ins. I've been turned away 2-3 times because of waits over an hour. The INSP burger and pulled pork fries are my fix. I'd say inspire is probably the best fusion restaurant in Markham. I'm glad there is somewhere to go after living in Chicago."}
{"text":"I saw the great reviews on Yelp and decided to come check it out but were a bit disappointed. We order the duck confit fries, steak salad and the chicken curry with roti and rice. The fries were not bad, would have preferred to be a bit crispier and more flavourful. My Husband's steak salad was really good though. The steak was medium rare, very flavourful. It went really well with the mango salad. My curry chicken on the other hand was a bit of a disappointment. The flavour was a bit weird to me. We also tried the banana bread pudding, sooooo good and the Matcha cheesecake which no one like. It was a bit salty. The price was a bit on the high side also."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I was initially skeptical because I'm not a fan of fusion. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken and waffles were the best I've had. The spices used in the syrup were delicious and fragrant. Chicken was tender on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice meal in Markham. Not alot of fusion restaurants so definitely am a fan. I've been here a couple of times of the years and I believe its gotten better. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved there chicken waffle and it was amazing. Lots of people when we were there around two but the two servers were super attentive so great customer service !! Would recommend it portion sizes are large but price is a bit higher too but worth the bucks ! Friends have said its a hit or miss haven't been there second time to know (they say second they went good were really salty and the third was meh)."}
{"text":"I'd rate it a 3.5 but I'm rounding up. The lunch menu looked amazing, so it was difficult to choose what to eat. Very nice place in the middle of main st. 

Ordered the far west burger with duck confit fries $13 + $4 extra -- the burger was on point! You can tell its made from scratch. This was my first time trying duck confit fries and I wasn't too blown away, although my friend loves it. Guess I'm not the biggest duck fan, that's not to say they weren't good. Just not mind blowing. They didn't have the pulled pork fries which was disappointing, only for dinner I guess :( 

Friend ordered the chicken and waffles $12 which she really enjoyed. There's some spice in the chicken, kind  of has a curry taste to it, so be prepared! The syrup was delish! 

Overall a good experience, I'd love to come back and check out dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here, beautiful restaurant. I came with a group and we got to sit in the alcove area in the front near the window and it's just a perfect place for a small party. We tried a bunch of the burgers and the udon carbonara, all of which were perfect. The service was pretty good, no real complaints. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu is pretty awesome.  Everything we ordered tasted great and the service is top notch.   Salmon burger was very tasty and pulled pork frites were awesome.  We checked out the weekend brunch menu and will come back to try that out as well."}
{"text":"Second time here and still satisfied. We had the chicken and waffles and the INSP burger with pulled pork fries. Portions are large and great for sharing and each dish is packed with a fusion of flavours that work well together. 
Service was friendly and consistent with my last visit. Love the eco friendly touch they have with the hand towels in the washroom instead of paper towels. Free parking can be found on the right of the restaurant. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Markham Rd and Hwy 7. There were a couple parking spots outside the main entrance, but we parked at the lot at the back of the building. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Our server was amazing. She continuously checked on our table and ensured our glasses of water were full at all times. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Romantic, cozy, and modern. One of my favourite spots for ambiance in Markham and great for celebrating special occasions! 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
Chicken was high-quality, beef was prime-grade, and all flavours were pleasantly multidimensional. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Chicken and Waffles - $18:00: deep fried chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Homemade Waffle was fresh and soaked up the ginger maple butter so well! Edamame mango raspberry chutney and berries refined and added lightness to the heavier chicken and waffles. 

- INSP Loco Moco - $22.00: prime grade beef was juicy and literally melted after each bite. Coconut rice was soft and aromatic, and went well with the creamy sunny side eggs. Shiitake demi and shrimps were fresh. Crispy onion and taro garnish was kind of overwhelming because there was a little too much of it and didn't go too well with the hearty rice, beef, shrimp, and eggs. 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
Definitely a phenomenal experience, a little pricey, but every dish was infused with such wonderful flavours. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for the refined Asian Fusion food and ambiance."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find if you're not from the area - there's not a huge sign outside and the door isnt really noticeable, BUT there is a public parking lot literally right beside it. Theyre also located right at the lights so be sure to signal and turn quick. 

Their ac is on the weak side. And in 40 degree weather like these days you'd expect them to crank it up a bit.. lets just say there was more of a breeze outside than the inside.

The restaurant was a bit smaller than I'd expected and there is no patio available. It is a decent size though, and for the area they're in its pretty much what you'd expect for most of the restaurants there. Decor feels almost a bit rustic, with lots of wood furnishings around. Ambience is relaxed but not too casual, and staff are friendly.

Their lunch menu isnt huge but it offers what the place is good at, which is what really matters if you think about it. Tried 2 things today: duck taco and their sig Inspire burger. Both were yum! The duck was tender and juicy, not chewy at all. Comes garnished with fried taro and cilantro or parsley (whichever you wanna call it), which adds some unique flavours to the taco. Flavours were also on point and not overly salty. The burger (with your choice of salad or fries) was the perfect size. With the pork neck, it really gave it an Asian feel, which is something different with fancy burgers these days.

Prices arent bad but definitely not what you'd expect at Hero's or Wendy's. Keep note of their hrs too - they close for breaks between lunch and dinner. After your meal, why not try going across the street for some gelato."}
{"text":"Love their Chicken and Waffles! Crispy juicy chicken and perfect waffles.  This place gets busy on the weekend, make reservation! A great hidden gem in markham!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Chicken and waffles are so flavourful, and the chicken pieces are moist. Also had the pulled pork fries and the Thai meatballs. Oh my, so much food! Portion size is good (should have ordered less haha).  For me and my husband, we were stuffed and didn't have room for dessert. Will visit again but will order less :)"}
{"text":"Thursday date night dinner! Sometimes walking in is easier than a reservation. 

We had the duck tacos as the appetizers and although they were very good, at $12 it's probably going to be a one time thing. 

I had the Golden Duck Malaysian Fried Rice for my entree. I didn't know what to expect from the description, but WOW it delivered some flavour. There's a lot going on in this dish but it is delicious! 

My girlfriend ordered the Udon Carbonera and it packed some punch. Its a very rich and thick flavour, and is also a lot spicier than you would think. The flavour gets a little overbearing towards the end of the meal, but that shouldn't discourage you from trying out the dish. 

Just wanted to mention that the service was excellent! Friendly staff who are very attentive. 

All in all, great place and great food. Can't wait to try their ceviche!"}
{"text":"came back here with my boyfriend for dinner and was slightly disappointed. 

Panko EggScobar ($10)
Mashed devil egg topped with chopped pork, bacon, and tobiko mixed in Soy mayo. The chef accidentally mixed it in mayo instead of Soy Mayo so they took this item off our bill which was nice and I appreciate their honesty as I personally wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between Soy mayo and normal mayo. The toppings didn't have much flavor, or at least the flavors didn't blend well - nothing special. Essentially the egg was like a fried boiled egg with bread crumbs on the outside - i would have expected the yolk to be mashed but not fully formed so that was disappointing. Overpriced considering the whole dish really is just one egg, $10 for a boil egg...? 

Double Bacon Cheesecake Burger ($20 + $4 for Duck Confit Fries)
They had me at cheesecake. Quite innovative and interesting for them to add a layer of matcha cheesecake into their prime beef burger, topped with bacon bringing in a sweet and savory taste. However, don't think it translated too well. Not sure if it was because it was a matcha flavored cheesecake, it wasn't too sweet and you could rarely taste the cheesecake flavor in each bite. The fries were disappointing. I remember last time I came the fries were amazing, but this time it lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce on the top was just a tiny drizzle. This dish definitely sounded better than it tasted.

Cry me a River ($35)
This was probably the best dish of the night. It was like a large bowl of seafood stew flavored in butter ginger coconut. The flavor of the stew was really good - really rich in flavor and quite sweet because of the coconut. Tasting the soup alone is a bit much, so having bread on the side to dip it in was nice. Lots of fresh seafood including shrimps, mussels, octopus, salmon, baby scallops and raw uni. Quite generous on their portions which made it more worth the price."}
{"text":"Very impressive fried chicken. Juicy?soft and crispy. The complex tastes of berry jam and spice  are so unique. It's a so creative restaurant"}
{"text":"I love their udon , it's delicious! So far everything that I've tried on the menu is amazing. It's always busy so you'll almost always need reservations. A lot of their interior decors are handmade by them, it's beautiful and unique. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"came by for lunch the other day.
ordered the far east burger with duck confit fries and tried some chicken and waffle.

far east burger was made 'medium' and the highlighted points of the burger were the pineapple and mango mayo. i like the pineapple flavour in the burger, it's not the first time i've had pineapple in the burger, but i wished for more pineapple. but then that may have been overpowering for the other flavours. which leads me to the mango mayo. i couldn't really taste the mango mayo unless i was eating that separetly from the other ingredients. but it was good when i could taste it. burger was juicy. pretty good burger.

the duck confit fries were a punch to my taste buds. lots of flavour, but a little salty. the fries were a bit salty and then the duck has it's own salty taste to it too. it would've been ok with either less fries, so u aren't consuming so much salt, or with less salt and same portions. the duck was pretty good and the sauce was good too.

the chicken and waffles. chicken was juicy and tender. no dry chicken breast pieces that i hate so much, like from kfc. the waffles were also softer than what im used to which made it easy to eat with the chicken. the syrup wasn't overly sweet and was a really nice balance in textures and flavours all around. obviously, not the healthy choice."}
{"text":"This place was tiny. You have to make reservations well in advance. We did it last minute and was able to get a table by the bar. This restaurant was recommended by my sister. It did not disappoint!  My favourite was the beef salad so flavourful! The other dishes we're great as well but it was very filling. We order a few dishes and shares it amongst 3 people. It's worth a try! The burger with the pork belly and egg addition was a bit much but still very good. The udon was a bit creamy for my taste but nonetheless not bad. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing place with amazing food! The servers were nice and the menu had many different things on it. When I say different, I mean things you wouldn't normally see. Squid burgers, duck frites, and a dish with both medium rare steak and fried chicken. Must go guys!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while after reading some great reviews on Yelp. It's my second time trying out an Asian Fusion restaurant (with the first time being at R&D in Chinatown) and I was quite impressed. Menu items are eye catching and intriguing. I'll definitely make time to come back to try some other stuff on their menu.

Service:
My friend and I came during the evening on a Thursday and were told that they were completely booked. Luckily there was one spot left at the bar where we were welcomed to sit at. So make sure you make reservations! :)

Food:
Chicken & Waffles
The whole dish was very cohesive. The seasoned crispy chicken and semi sweet waffles were perfect together as every chicken and waffle dish should be. It also came with a small side of blueberry sauce. 

Salmon Burger and Duck Confit Fries
I think this was probably my favourite dish out of the two that we got. Fries were amazing - skinny cut fries seasoned with kimchi mayo and thai chilli with helpful servings of crispy duck = yummy. It was my first time having a salmon burger and it was quite a memorable experience haha. The juicy salmon was cooked perfectly to a medium-well to well done. The sesame mayo, shallots and pickled ginger made the burger overall very tasty and flavourful. This dish was a home run."}
{"text":"I was very optimistic when I came across the Yelp reviews and photos, but our experience was sub-mediocre to mediocre.  I will give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt that perhaps we came in on an off-day on a Friday night.

Seating: We were the last to be sat at 6:30pm, but the first to be served. Not a good sight for the other patrons with drinks and no food I'm sure.

Staff: Understaffed.  Tried to sell appetizers hard, but we didn't bite. Didn't know why such insistence at first, but then we knew why... (see next section).  When we left, there wasn't a goodbye, thank you, or anything. No words.


Food prep: Inconsistent. My partner ordered identical item, but he had no issues with the flavouring of spices.

Wait Time for Food:  Long.  Was in the throes of getting up to put on my coat 30 minutes later when suddenly arrives...

Chicken and Waffles: The flavours did not work well together.  I am NOT speaking of the chicken + waffle + syrup---I am referring to the spices, flour batter, kiwi bits, and meringue dots.  My first impression when the plate was set down was, \"This portion is fantastic and large but Oh my God there is a whole, 8-pointed anise sitting on my plate...I better not be biting into whole anises throughout my meal or my tastebuds will suffer greatly\".  

Batter - premixed batter for deep fried chicken that is used at lots of bubble tea shops' snack menu
Spices - didn't go well with batter, every bite was a different, upsetting taste experience of cloves, anise, pepper flake, if you are really insistent on using these spices, try a pestle & mortar. But flavours are uncomfortable and shocking. 
Kiwi - did nothing to compliment anything. It's like this kiwi was the last kid picked in a gym class.
Black half-cut fruit shapes - I couldn't figure out what fruit this was. My guess is grape or blueberry cut in halves.
Waffle - pre-made.  Not fresh.  I am -almost- tempted to say they tasted like they had been pre-made, frozen, and then warmed up again prior to serving.
Meringue dots - cheap pink and white meringue cookies that tasted like...not meringue but more like...flouride...the cheap ones they sell at chinese bakeries.

To be fair, I will try Smash Kitchen & Bar's chicken and waffles and write a review later on to make a more proper comparison.  But this review was definitely not a comparison, but simply my honest thoughts about my own dining experience.  Brutal honesty may be better than saying nothing at all and watching this place crash and burn."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 6pm and arrived around 10 mins early. However, the restaurant does not open its doors until 6pm for dinner so we were stuck wandering around outside until doors were opened. Once we got in, we were seated immediately and served promptly.

Overall food was really good. Here are the things that stood out:  

INSP Burger - messy to eat, and the processed cheese really stuck out from the other nice flavours of the burger. The fries that were served with it were tasteful but too soft for my liking. 

Chicken & Waffle - chicken was perfectly done (crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside). Seasonal compote was too sweet for my liking and almost tasted like it came out of a jam jar."}
{"text":"Inspire Restaurant is the only reason why I would ever wish that I was an uptown girl.

*Make reservations for dinner!
*Super convenient parking just behind the restaurant

Sitting in for lunch, this spot is a must-try. I fell in-love with the menu immediately. The Chicken & Waffles couldn't be THAT good, could they be? Quit your doubting.They are fantastic. They must have really made some change ups after reading past reviews as well, proactive on their improvements! 

Whhad' we get? 
- Panko Scotch Egg ($5)
- Oysters \"Casino\" ($4)
- Far East Burger ($13)
- Chicken & Waffles ($12) 
- De-constructed Trinity Creme ($9)

And, what should you get?...
SCOTCH EGG ($5)  Yes. yes. yes. yes. The mystical \"Scotch Egg\" has been peaking my curiousity since my good ol' Neopets days. Presented with the most Asian twist, it was fantastic. The rubbery egg (eh) was not what we fell in love with - it was the encasing of Nori, and then the crisp Panko-crusted Pork evenly coated around. It was savoury, and with the lining of Berry Compote along each bite, it sure made a surprising fork-full of beautifully balanced flavours.

FAR EAST BURGER ($13)  On point with it's heavenly sweet bun, and juicy, juicy Prime Beef Patty, and to balance all of that out, Grilled Pineapple pieces and Mango Mayonnaise. Gosh. Nibbling throughout, there are also shreds of crispy Taro Chips which escalated the bites further more, A true beauty.

CHICKEN & WAFFLES ($12)  We are all in luck. This mouth-watering darling is available for both lunch and dinner! The beautifully crisp Chicken is brined and battered in almighty goodness; it was full of flavour and had a light crunch! The Waffles were also perfect, sweeter than your usual, it also had an interesting lightly spiced batter. The two drops of meringues actually complimented the dish so well.

DE-CONSTRUCTED TRINITY CREME ($12)  It felt like the expected torched topping of the Creme Brulee came up to play with us (but, got stuck there). This was delicious. The Creme Brulee had a lovely texture, very light in both Ginger and Cardamom spices. 

A near-perfect lunch. 4/5 orders were a success. Already, a favourite of 2015! 

I'll be back for dinner... and a brunch, then again for a lunch."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Inspire Restaurant since July 2014. And it took me so long till I finally here for dinner.

Saturday Reservation: Either 6:15 or 8:15 pm. We are cool with late dinner as we can take our time without being rushed.

4 Star for what Inspire Restaurant brings to the Markham, a \"Downtown\" quality restaurant in the suburbs. Interesting and unique offerings compares to other in the area.

We ordered a few things to share:

Short Ribs As-Is ($10) - Meh
Wonton Au Gratin ($12) - A-OK
Chicken & Waffle ($16) - A-OK the boneless chicken was so juicy! I love ginger maple syrup too!
The INSP Burger ($15)  Duck Confit Fries (+$4) - Burger was good, Fries were soggy!
Udon Carbonara ($18)

Banana Bread Ice Cream Sandwich ($12) - Best Item of the Night! Banana Me!
Green Tea Chili Cheesecake ($10)

Food is 3 Star in general. Most of them were not too memorable aside from the Banana Bread Ice Cream Sandwich as I have this thing with those mini peanut butter cups!

Service. Service might be the biggest issue of the evening. Waitress no where to be seen when we wanted to order dessert or get our bill. Mind you, the restaurant was almost empty aside from another table. I hate doing that, but I have to yell out and wave one of them down so we can get someone to take our order. The service here is equivalent and remind me of BBT joint. On the other hand, the bus boy was really nice always making sure that our water glasses never empty.

I am happy to have Inspire Restaurant in my neighbourhood. I will probably be back and hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"Came here twice (once for lunch and a couple days later for Saturday brunch), and both times I had great food and service. The food is original and creative; fusing Asian flavors seamlessly into traditional favorites. I found it to be great value as well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Inspire Burger is the best! Comes with a fried egg inside the burger and the fried are amazing! The portions are huge. I wish I had enough room in my stomach to finish the fries. There's also the option to upgrade your fries to a pulled duck poutine which is definitely worth."}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bite!! Highly recommended. Can't believe I waited two years to try this restaurant. Definitely one of Markham's gems."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!

I've tried the chicken and waffles, and the INSP burger a few times. My favourite is the pulled pork fries as a side. The food is very inventive and tasty, plus the restaurant is very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype. I tried the pulled pork fries and INSP burger with duck confit fries, both delicious. Make reservations, this place fills up. Unique flavours blended together-must try in the North End."}
{"text":"This was my very first time having chicken and waffle. I had always wanted to try it because everyone made it sound like it was a match in heaven, and people were not wrong about it. It was really good together, the salty chicken and the sweet syrup with the soft waffle actual went very well together. I am still searching for other chicken and waffle places to compare to this restaurant. I forgot to mention that I added a fried egg on top, which improve increased the texture and flavour even more.

One more thing, for those who like spicy food, do not forget to ask for their homemade hot sauce, because it was really good with the chicken. And, for those who have a second stomach for dessert do not skip out on it because it was really delicious. Overall, my experience here was great, the restaurant is not big so it would not be able to hold big parties, and always make sure to make a reservation if you have 6+ people. 

Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Environment: 4/5

Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb. The INSP burger is delish along with chicken & waffles.  A must go for sure if your in the area"}
{"text":"I came here in May as a party of 6 for dinner.  I had the INSP Burger ($15) and shared a pulled pork fries with the table.  The burger was juicy and the fried egg was a nice touch in the burger. The pulled pork fries were good. Our waiter was friendly and we didn't have any problems with service. Overall, it was an enjoyable dinner.

Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"Great place for every meal time, would highly recommend their pull pork fries and INSP burger but all their burgers are great. Great flavors and taste for a reasonable price and fairly large portions. Service was great the few times I've been there, our cups were constantly filled, made sure we enjoyed everything and made great conversation. Since the place is a bit small, I would recommend making reservations as there are some nights where they are packed."}
{"text":"Reservations are a must, my boyfriend called in on a Monday (6 days before) and we could only get a 8:30pm time slot. The restaurant isn't very big but the space is quaint and comfortable. The chicken and waffles were a must try - it was a good balance of sweet and salty. The INSP burger was huge but nothing too special, it was heavy given the combination of a beef patty and pork belly. I would definitely recommend upgrading the fries to pulled pork or duck confit! Service was on point and food arrived quite fast, I would come back to try other stuff even though the menu is limited as others mentioned."}
{"text":"Interesting fusion restaurant. 
I enjoyed the waffle and chicken (skinless and boneless). Chicken breast was well seasoned , not dry at all 
My hubby had the tandoori chicken pasta. It was an interesting fusion dish, however it was too salty, wont order it again.

Pork belly sandwich was quite flavourful, the side of French fries was delicious 
Will come back"}
{"text":"They know how to make you dance in your seat with the kind of food they make. I don't even understand how they can make it so damn delicious. Pricey, but I definitely think its worth it. Satisfaction guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Fantasy fusion foods, great service and ambiance.  Highly recommended.  Lettuce Pray, genius."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out inspire restaurant brunch menu.

Inspire Restaurant has a mellow ambience with a vibrant flow. It is a restaurant where you can take your family, significant other or friends when you want to indulge in flavourful meals different from the usual places you would taste in Markham.

Ordered the \"Peking\" uni-corn pancakes cheese scrambler which is pancakes filled with maple glazed charred jalapenos topped with a juicy pork belly, aged cheddar, scramled egg and uni.

The uni-corn pancake went above my expectation. The combination of the juicy pork belly + jalapeno pancake + scrambled egg had succulent savoury but yet mildly sweet taste to it. I can now see why they are always booked up for brunch. Great service, food and environment overall!"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype on Inspire restaurant for the past few months. Usually, when I'm uptown, I stick to Asian food, but it's nice to have something a little different in the Markham neighbourhood.

My favourite here is the udon carbonara. I've ordered this both times because I just couldn't get enough of it! It's rich, creamy, flavourful, and everything you want for a cold day. I've also sampled other dishes - chicken and waffles (which seems to be a customer favourite), the INSP burger, and the duck confit fries. The portions were fairly generous. The udon carbonara is still my favourite, and the only thing that I wasn't a huge fan of was the poutine, which was a tad dry for my liking. 

All in all, I am a fan of the place. Usually the word \"fusion\" scares me, but Inspire Restaurant execute the food well. I will be back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Found ants in my burger bun and they acted like it wasnt anything bad and said oh we leave the back door open."}
{"text":"I've come to Inspire a few times and it's definitely one of the recommended staple restaurants in Markham. I went recently for dinner and I now have a solid rating of 3.5-4/5. 

The first time I came for lunch a few years ago, the high price and the meal was not that amazing to me and if I rated it then, it would have been a 3. Now that I've came back, I've bumped it up as I think it was a great visit. The interior of this place is the modern Asian aesthetic. It's definitely a great place for a date if you like Asian fusion dishes, but make reservations as Inspire is small and a large group that walks in most likely won't be able to snag a table. 

We ordered the pulled pork fries appetizer to share, but really I just recommend you ordering something and if it comes with fries, pay the extra $2 to upgrade. I ordered the INSP burger which was quite massive and it came with a large side of fries. While the fries were great with the pulled pork as the combination of stuff it came with balanced it out, the fries that are on its own were greasy and became too much half way through. The burger was also a touch too greasy as well, but I really enjoyed the combination of ingredients and it is a monster burger. My boyfriend gave me a bite of his That Sweet Chick (chicken version) and I found his burger to be lighter but still really tasty as well. I think I'd order the chicken instead next time. Our table ordered a variety of dishes, ranging from the Hanoi Salad, Chicken and Waffles, and a variety of burgers. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dishes without any complaints (aside from the greeeezyness from the INSP burgers). 

In conclusion, Inspire is for the special occasions or bougie moments as it is a little pricey with dishes mostly starting at the $16 mark, but you're paying for quality dishes, a great atmosphere, and you'll definitely be full with whatever you're ordering."}
{"text":"Came here last night and after reading the reviews i expected a great meal and i was not disappointed. 

I made reservations for 8 which wasnt that necessary for a wednesday but the service was great.

Our server was so polite and patient even when we were indecisive and changed an order. 

I ordered the Hanoi beef salad which was wonderful. The beef was cooked perfectly and the flavors were well balanced and not overwhelming. This is a great option for someone looking for a light yet filling dish.

My friends ordered:

The chicken & waffles - a signature dish which he loved! 

The udon carbonara - very creamy and delicious.

INSP burger - juicy burger and fries are rly good!

Indonesian rice (dont remember the name) - really flavorful! 

Overall an awesome dining experience and i will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here twice, both are for lunch. Didn't know this place until my friend recommend me here, surely it's the right choice. They have tasty burger and chicken and waffles, leave my mouth drooling for more every time just thinking about it, parking is easy. Pretty cozy environment, order the chicken and waffles, immediately found myself in heaven, portions are huge... can barely finish. The burger is amazing tasty."}
{"text":"This is my fav restaurant in Markham, food is always delicious and service is awesome! Their short ribs is to die for!  They cook their food with heart and soul, highly recommended!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Inspire; service was great, waitress was attentive and friendly even though we came five minutes before last call for lunch. 

I got the Korean burger which was decent but their lunch menu doesn't quite do justice for their dinner menu. 

Meat was tender, great. Only thing I wasn't too pleased about was that the meat was a little too raw for me in the middle. Would've liked it better if the waitress asked me about my preference but no big deal.

Fries were great as usual and luckily we didn't have a line up like they usually do for dinner."}
{"text":"Fusion restaurants usually have me running for the hills BUT I decided to try it out. Unlike most restaurants that serve westernized versions of Asian food, we have Inspire that serves western food with an Asian twist. :S

I was looking for a place to stop by before heading to this bookstore and I saw chicken and waffle on their menu.How can it go wrong? 

Well... there was definitely an Asian flair...or rather taste to their chicken. I believe it was white pepper but I could be wrong. It just didn't go as well as I would have hoped with the maple syrup. The waffles were flat but I guess they were Ok. Their saving grace was that if you ate the chicken on its own, it was pretty good and tender. I was half expecting it to be raw....but looked cooked to me. 

I really could do without the meringues though. It was just heinous in combination with the rest of the meal. 

On the plus side, we were able to watch the Food Network while we ate."}
{"text":"It's good. The chicken & waffles; good portion and fusion of flavors.  It's anise and ginger syrup for the idiot that called it \"weird curry taste\".  Friggin 12 year olds on yelp..."}
{"text":"Udon carbonara - the sauce is fantastic, not too creamy, and comes with plenty of meat. I love udon dishes and this is one of my all-time favourites. 

Chicken and waffles - good portion size. Chicken was cooked wonderfully, was not dry at all, and tasted slightly Asian somehow. Waffles were good but I would have preferred them to be more crunchy. I thought the berry sauce was unique and tasty.

The food is high quality and reasonably priced. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Today is Valentine's Day 2018.  Though not a romantic at heart, I've decided to write some reviews today.  Particularly, spots that I view as probably the hot bed of activities on Valentines.

If by chance you are a hapless romantic and should you be reading this today, you're probably out of luck!  Most places would have overbooked-itis.  Some might say I should have written this sooner but that would defeat this as a Valentine's day 2018 review.  Catch 22 my friends.

Inspire seems to be a very popular place for many.  I have been meaning to go for years, but it's a little out of the way for me.  From what I know, Chef John Hoy Ouk (from my days at Marlowe) opened it and I wanted to try it.

From day one, the reviews have flooded in, as their Chicken and Waffles, Inspire Burger, Duck Confit Fries, Udon Carbonara, and other clever menu items, garnered excellent write ups.

Having an evening free and coming back from the east end of town, I decided I must try this place.  I was recommended to get a reservation.  I did, and for those who didn't - the restaurant was not that busy at 6PM.  You can guess that on a Tuesday night with bargain movie dating that they won't fill up until about 7PM onwards.

Dinner was Chicken and Waffles, Inspire Burger, and some wine.  I had a small piece of the chicken and it was ridiculously infused with sweet flavours but remained crispy.  The Burger was piled high and I had to deconstruct it a bit to make it worth eating without embarrassing oneself.  Really messy to eat, but packed with flavours.  

Both dishes are a large size so I would encourage sharing of the meals.  Perhaps some of you will have a \"Lady and a Tramp\" moment with the Udon!

The restaurant is small and cozy.  Decor is nice and a pleasant place to have a meal - whatever the occasion.  Plenty of parking in the lot - depending on what time you get there.

Watch for the hours of operations.  If you are coming for dinner, expect the doors to remain locked until 6PM.  That was a bit of an unexpected lack in customer service, as people waited outside in the cold.  I was entertained by watching and listening to the cooks who were \"smokin'something\" at the side of the building.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was very good here. Been here 2 time and both time is very good . Must try place but make sure you call in to book a table because they are always busy and it a very small place"}
{"text":"This restaurant is cute, small and trendy. I ordered chicken waffles with berry sauce. And I loved it. Definitely going back .The staff are friendly. It was 9pm when we got there and still full of people. Lots of parking on the side"}
{"text":"I came here for an anniversary dinner with my husband and enjoyed the food. I highly recommend the INSP burger because it is one of the most creative, delicious burgers I've ever had. The servers were excellent and were very friendly. This place is a bit small but very unique and artistic, with different walls of artwork and relaxing music. 
The INSP burger had pork belly, taro chips, egg and a huge piece of meat that I must say is better than Burger's Priest. You could order duck confit fries which has a delicious mayo with it as well. The fries are the stringy kind that I love and the portions are very generous. The fries were a bit dry when I went though this time around.
The Udon Carbonara was freshly made, the sauce was very delicious and I liked the texture of the udon. It was very filling and tasty, but I think that the burger is the best thing offered at this restaurant. The price is also very reasonable for a high quality fusion restaurant in Markham."}
