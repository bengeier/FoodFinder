{"text":"Was looking forward to try this place tonight. To our disappointment, they're closed!! On a Friday night they're closed! We should've known something was up cause their phone was invalid! Arrival time was 6p.m.!!"}
{"text":"Good food! Good friend!  The food is really tasty and the service is great!it is really nice place to dining in! I will definitely come back for more..."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my husband recently. Basically, it does have many spicy food here. People who love spicy food will love here. The waitresses can speak English and Mandarin Chinese here.  We ordered four spicy food since I love love spicy food. These food were awesome. One waitress called Amy was very nice. The environment of this restaurant was very clean.  We always come to Vegas for trip, and we are so glad to find this restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 5 stars because the service is really good. But the food was not really authentic. Mala means numb and spicy so I was looking for this kind of spice level. Maybe I didn't order the right kind of food, I will try this place again to give them a second chance. I have a feeling they cook to American taste buds...."}
{"text":"I hate giving low stars on a new restaurant but there's a couple things that caused this. It's a newly opened place yes, everything looked nice and clean.   Cons are, the bathroom has a new paint smell, and it's really bad, I know it's normal but they should at least keep the door open at night, because it's really really bad when I was there, I literally couldn't breath, I rushed in washed my hands and ran back out, the smell.  The food: like all other spicy foods, pretty good, but I ordered some fried chicken wings that are not fully cooked inside, I saw red blood after my first bite so that was it for the wings.  The price: Price SEEMED normal, but I got a way higher bill than I expected ( twice as much ), how did that happen ? I wasn't sure, I was in a rush so I said forget it. So make sure you check your bill before you leave, maybe compare to a menu?   Pros: Clean, waiter/waitress checked on drinks constantly, very good service. Big bun with soup inside, very good, ate it all. Menu has a lot of appetizers dish, not as much entrees. Ate a big balloon shaped pancake? Deep fried, empty inside, looks really cool, taste good too. Chicken wings has this amazing crust, only crust tho, I didn't eat any meat.  Anyways I probably will give this place another try after couple of month and let them get familiar with the new business."}
{"text":"Mala is a new Szechuan place, specializing in more traditional dishes, with a small selection of dim sum items. I stuck to appetizers and smaller tapas-style bites on my first visit but was pleased with the quality and service.  BABY WON TONS IN HOT CHILI OIL: The best! Tiny, delicate pouches with a pinch of filling, swimming in a fantastic chili oil with bits of garlic. This was my favorite dish, and one I'll be coming back for. FISH ROLLS: Skinny rolls filled with fish and cilantro, wrapped in crispy won ton skins, reminded me of a fresh take on lamb cigars in Mediterranean cuisine. These were simple but good. WOODEAR MUSHROOMS: BF picked this dish, and he liked it. I did not care for the jellied texture of the mushrooms. These were seasoned with a slightly-spicy sauce and a lot of lemongrass.  CRISPY SHRIMP IN GARLIC OIL: Five crispy shrimp,  with a savory chopped mushroom topping, nicely cooked. I did not care for the \"garlic oil\", as it did not have much flavor and lent the dish a greasy feel.  PORK AND SHRIMP SHUMAI: These were served in the steamer baskets, and had thicker skins than I am used to. The dipping sauce was a bit bland, but the filling was generous and balanced.   Throughout our meal, service was attentive and polite. They are still in the grand opening stage until the end of the month, and have several promising-looking entrees and hotpot dishes."}
{"text":"Brand new open restaurant! The food is really tasty, and the service are nice also! I will definitely come back again! If people like spice food, this is the place to try! Trust me you will love it."}
{"text":"I Wil be back again..because I really love the food ,like Chines bbq pork it has mild spicy and crispy pork  colorful ,smell good ,make me mouth watering.O will come back try other dishes.Go Mala!"}
{"text":"so, this joint is good! i've always been a fan of szechuan food. if you've never had szechuan style chinese food, you're in for a treat. they use a lot of szechuan peppercorns in their dishes and red chiles. most everything is a deep dark red color and everything is spicy. but it's not the kind of spice that lingers. it typically subsides within minutes but the flavors are pretty outstanding while you're eating.  mala does some good stuff. the chicken wings are pretty delicious. the string beans were tasty but a little soggy for me...i want them crunchy still. the spicy wontons were decent but at 1 pepper, it was a lot spicier than i thought it would be. the scallion pancake balloon thing was really good and kinda fun to eat. the dan dan noodles were very good. the hot pot thing we had with a bunch of seafood and other meats was very good as well and not as spicy as i imagined. it's a 3 pepper dish but seemed about the same level of spiciness as the wontons.  this is a place i'd return to for sure. there's so much on the menu to try and the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount of food that is served. just remember, rice is definitely your friend here. you're gonna need it."}
{"text":"We we're really exited to try this new place out l. However wasn't what we expected. We order the spicy wing and the tooth pick lamb. The presentation was very good, but food was terrible. My wings came out still raw and cold. I  told the waitress about the raw chicken, she let us know that she will talk to the chef.   I was so mad that they didn't offer to redo it and they still charge me for it. I only taken a bite of it. Will not be coming back here, they were not ready to open a restaurant. I have read pass review that the wing was raw, they still didn't put an effort to change it."}
{"text":"Amazing place to dine and try something new. The atmosphere is welcoming and serene. They entail a private room for intimate group parties as well as a back room for larger parties. The food is absolutely delicious and very apparent on its traditional preparations. Something different in the Vegas area that I believe many have been wanting but did not know. This is definitely a try before you die place!!"}
{"text":"We started with soup which was unique than any other I have tried at a Chinese restaurant.  The huge portions of fish which looked like dumplings which complemented the slightly sour broth well.  Their appetizers are a high point. The dry fried eggplant and the fried pork cane in bamboo baskets which made the presentation quirky yet elegant. Tastes like fries but 100 times better.  The toothpick Lamb was another high point. Each morsel of lamb is skewered by a toothpick.  Standard Chinese fare also stood out above most other Chinese restaurants.  The Mongolian beef tasted as good as the fancy strip casino restaurants, the mapo tofu had the unique hot oil taste which makes your tongue burn just the right amount.  Service was attentive and quick. Even the owner came and serviced out table.  That a good sign the management really is trying their best. A must try for spicy food lovers."}
{"text":"Pretty good schiuan restaurant in Las Vegas. I usually go to the other one called J&J but this place is pretty good especially the fish fillet fish in a sour cabbage soup.  The cabbage still has a little of freshness eventhough it was blanched in the soup!  I also tried the mapo tofu which had a bit too much of the black bean taste for me.  Overall it was good and decent!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already, very impressive with the taste of their food and the environment. I like their spicy intestine in hot plate."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Delicious food ,clean place, and people friendly.The name MaLa just like some dishes taste hot and numbing,good thins about this restaurants re customs can chang spicy level as they want, I can't eat very spicy food, but I can lower the spicy level, this way makes me very happy and feel comfortable.People who loves spice food or small plates ,you must go to MaLa to try it out."}
{"text":"very good,so tasty,the heavenly shrimp and the lamb chops are so good!!! the bubble pancakes is so creative"}
{"text":"Grand opening.. The food is really tasty and the service is great!it is really nice place to dining in! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Only a month new this restaurant is outside of the Chinatown area but has convenient parking which is shared with the business next store.   The establishment specializes in spicy Szechwan entrees and the interior is decorated tastefully. I started off with a cup of wonton soup and followed with the seafood  hot pot which was loaded with fish, shrimp, calamari and veggies. The hotpot was so large I couldn't finish the entree but was satisfing.   I'll be returning here next time I'm in town and try a lamb or a spicy dish."}
{"text":"Szechuan game is not too shabby. I was lured by some fellow yelper's photo of a ginormous dumpling with a straw, and decided to dine here with a group for dinner.  Big soup dumpling- 3 stars.  This thing is pretty to look at, but the flavor was OK.   Spicy dry fried chicken- 5 stars.  REALLY good. Perfectly cooked and crisp on the outside. We had to get an additional order since we loved it so much!  Spicy numbing hot pot with chicken, fish, shrimp, and beef- 4 stars. I wanted more spice and szechuan power in here, but it's all good. A definite must-try.   Spicy fried green beans- 5 stars. I really enjoyed this dish. Nice way to feel semi-healthy cuz it's GREEN.   Green onion pancake- 5 stars. This stuff is booooooomb. Their curry sauce was a bit of a surprise for me at a Chinese restaurant, but nonetheless, it was delicious!   Dandan noodles- 4.5 stars. This was really good as well.   I'd definitely be back for several of the items and try a few other dishes while I'm at it!  GOOOOOOOO SZECHUAN!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended me to come here for a dinner. This is a new Szechwan restaurant. My wife and I came here during our trip. We ordered three food, Mala chicken, pork and shrimp dumplings. They were pretty good. My wife liked them very much. We will come back again."}
{"text":"Initially, we had high hopes for this new restaurant, but after a lunch, Mala proved to be disappointing. I would have given them one star, but they had good service hence two stars.  Mala means numbing and spicy. We ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to be numbing and spicy; however, the dish wasn't numbing nor flavorful, only the spiciness was apparent. We told the manager, and she was quick to fix it by offering to redo the dish again. The second time around, the dish was more spicy but still lacked the numbness. Perhaps the peppercorns used weren't fresh enough to bring out the numbness.   Our second dish was a seafood hotpot. Again, we had to inform the manager that the dish did not taste right because the shrimp was not fresh enough and had a very apparent bad taste to them. The chef redid the dish again, and everything tasted fine the second time around.   We also ordered a soup bun. The soup was average, but the pork inside tasted a tad sour. We didn't inform the manager of this.   It was quite disappointing to come try a new restaurant only to experience food that wasn't fresh. I hope this won't be a regular occurrence."}
