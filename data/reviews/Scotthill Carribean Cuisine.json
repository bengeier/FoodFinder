{"text":"A wonderful addition to the neighborhood! Warm atmosphere, family-owned and operated, and the food is fantastic!!! A great deal too, used them for takeout , had 2 dinners, 2 extra side orders of plantain, and 1 of coleslaw, and it was $37 incl. taxes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Portions are huge - you can easily split 1 roti between 2 people.  Chicken wings are delightful - tender and flavorful. Beef and chicken patties are a real treat.  My fav is the chicken curry roti. Tender chunks of chicken flavored with curry sauce all wrapped in a roti blanket."}
{"text":"Oh, excuse me?!?! Large portions, delicious home-cooked food, fair prices, friendly service... this place has all to meet my heart's desire!!!  We had the curry chicken roti and the escabeche king fish. The roti was flaky, flavourful, comforting, and GIANT. The king fish was perfectly cooked, and very fresh. The plantains, rice and coleslaw were so tasty too, I could have had a whole bowl of those!  I highly recommend you come here. Like now, stop reading. Go."}
{"text":"ordered the jerk chicken roti meal incredible flavors incredible service waiter also gave us soup on the house while we waiting for the meals to be made will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This review is based upon uber eats.   I was so excited to finally see a Caribbean restaurant in the area, as it really is lacking around here. I ordered the jerk chicken meal and a patty. Everything was dry and cold! The jerk chicken was dry and almost burnt to a crisp. I also added to put extra gravy, but not a drop. The plantain was hard and barely edible. The patty could have been the saving grace, but it was so cold, that I couldn't enjoy it. I am so disappointed that this did not turn out to be a positive experience. It looks like my search continues."}
{"text":"Really good jamaican food in an area with nothing else like it.  Friendly staff, good portions, just as good as any other jamaican place in the city I have been to."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Jamaican food I've eaten. Granted I've only had the jerk chicken; that said, the care and love in this food is remarkable and unmistakable.  Perfectly seasoned and done with care.  I could drink the gravy in a mug.  Hot sauce is homemade and adds to the food."}
{"text":"If I didn't walk up Avenue, I would have never discovered this place. My friend and I were debating between sushi, pasta, oh a bistro...oh what's this...Carribean cuisine...why not? I've been wanting to try Carribean food for a while but places like Ritz and Tasty were too far and I would never have anyone to accompany me...lol.  We came here on the first day of their opening and there were already many take out orders. In comparison to Yonge Street, I find this restaurant to be family-oriented and a date spot. I see it becoming a local favourite, more so due to the lack of dine-in Carribean restaurants. In terms of parking, I recommend parking in the neighbourhoods and walking over if you don't want to pay.  Before this, I've been to Rhum Corner on Dundas with my Haitian friend. I've had plantains and rice and beans there and this was what I based my review off of.  Since it was the first day of its opening, we were unable to order some items on the menu. We ended up having Jerk Chicken ($10) and BBQ Chicken ($10). Both came with a side of coleslaw and rice. Everything tasted fresh and service was great. We also talked briefly with who I assume was the owner - he asked about how we found the food and all. My impression was that this restaurant wanted to steer away from the \"grubby,\" heavy meals being served in white styrofoam containers and instead, allow individuals to enjoy these meals in a different setting. At the same time, it wanted to preserve Carribean culture and foods. However, at the same time, I was expecting larger portions. A recommendation I have is for a complimentary appetizer to be served beforehand. This would also allow customers to have a better idea of the food as there are not many Carribean restaurants in the area...just a recommendation though. :)  Overall, a good place for a dine-in Carribean experience."}
{"text":"Great service! Everyone is so friendly. The food is fantastic! So authentic! I had the jerk chicken dinner. The portion for one is massive! Definitely of value. The food quality itself is amazing. The plantains are out of this world! It's so rare to find a quality Jamaican restaurant in the Avenue/Wilson area - so this is awesome!"}
{"text":"An exciting and refreshing experience in Jamaican cuisine. The Menu is packed with all the familiar flavours and delights that Jamaican Cuisine Lovers have come to expect plus those sweet delicious fried plantains are included as standard, no need to ask!  The Restaurant is well positioned on Avenue road nestled in among all kinds of respectable businesses which contributes to a delightful shopping experience for everyone. Whether you choose to pay a brief visit to order and take out or stay for a served meal in the cozy atmosphere which will transport you into Scothill Jamaica itself, I'm sure you will me pleasantly rewarded and satisfied with your experience."}
{"text":"Just noticed this place while walking up Avenue. All I have to say is if you are a fan of Caribbean food, you need to come here now.   We started with the complimentary vegetable soup which set the mood with its spices and flavourful broth.   The curry shrimp appie was light, fresh, not over spiced and just delish.   I have the oxtail entre....I cannot type as fast as I need to in order to get back to this meal. Yes. This is so good I had to write my review now.   My wife had the jerk chicken.  Another amazing dish.   Everything was seasoned so well and nothing was over salted which sometimes is the case    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Looks like a place I would want to hang out and listen to music. I saw instruments when I went to pick up food.  Not sure they have designated parking, however there is parking on the street and it is limited.  I have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant, so I was really looking forward to seeing what they offered.  Very hesitant to say as I was really looking forward to their food.  Ordered BBQ jerk and oxtail both came with rice and peas and complimentary plantain. The BBQ jerk chicken and rice and peas were drenched in a very thick sweet sort of tangy bbq sauce. Not sure where the jerk part was, but it was not tasty. The sauce was over kill. The oxtail was sweet as if someone added sugar. The plantains were rock hard... couldn't chew.  I may try another dish, but if it as bad as the first two I won't be back."}
{"text":"My new favourite place to eat on Avenue Rd, north of Lawrence. Nice setting inside, and friendly staff. Food came quickly, and our jerk and curry chicken were nicely done."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration and I was impressed. There was a live band playing old school reggae music. The waiters were very friendly and accommodating. Less than 3 mins after I sat down, a waiter brought me a bowl of delicious homemade chicken soup.   The food was absolutely delicious, rich and well seasoned. The portions are generous, all meals come served with plantains, coleslaw and vegetables.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Greetings!! Went here today and we had the oxtails and jerk chicken which both were delish.  Also the soup was outstanding!! We also ordered a Scotthill and two beef patties which the lady forgot to bring out to the table. However, the atmosphere and food made up for the little mishap!! Definitely would recommend and return!!"}
{"text":"A wicked spot. Service and staff is awesome, decor has a nice cool vibe to it, and the food was delicious, lots of flavour, I suggest the jerk chicken. Perfect for a date night, or a nice relaxing evening with some good food and good vibes!! Get on board and check out scotthill"}
{"text":"We ordered this via UberEATS because it showed up as nearby. We did not expect a dinner as good as this one! Likely my best meal in recent memory. The jerk chicken and veggie channa were spectacular. This place is so damn good!! We'll be back. So glad it's now in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Have taken out from here several times - love their jerk chicken.  They have quite a few tables if you prefer to eat in.  The food takes a little while because it is freshly made.  Their callaloo soup is also delicious.  Owners are very friendly."}
