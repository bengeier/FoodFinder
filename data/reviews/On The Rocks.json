{"text":"I have been to On The Rocks for both lunch and dinner. Food is good and I found it cheap too.

I liked the environment ."}
{"text":"A group of us from out of town celebrated my wife's 50th birthday here on Thursday night. The atmosphere was amazing as well as entertaining (Cat, Dave and T-Bone) and the food and drinks were affordable. I have never been to a karaoke bar, but I am now a big fan. I didn't get our waitresses name, but she was very good. Kudos to the Thursday night staff at On the Rocks. Our group had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's a dive bar full of colorful personalities and a very mixed clientele. There are a lot of local regulars and different groups of people of varying ages. I've seen anyone from Bay st. suits, to little people, to a guy dressed in a banana suit, to Eric McCormack (from The Will and Grace tv show) to fire fighters come into this bar to partake in the karaoke nights. This place is random and that's what makes it so amazing!

Everyone is so friendly here, that you always feel welcomed by the staff and the regulars.

Although the \"late night\" food menu isn't anything special, the daytime menu is pretty good. I LOVE their YPT soup!

I love it here and recommend it to everyone, but I know it's not for everyone. Just sit back and laugh at the karaoke entertainment."}
{"text":"I'm not being cheeky here, but if you like dives, and you like karaoke, this is the place for you! 

It's a Chinese restaurant that turns into a karaoke bar at night. You won't hate the food but you won't love it either.  Now for the real reason behind this review... 

It's been a while since I've been there but from what I recall, they have a number of drink specials - tequila and jager shots for $4, think bar rails are $4 or $5, amongst others. The crowd is a mix of weird regulars, local students, and random working professionals like us who enjoy making a mockery of themselves in a dive where you're unlikely to encounter people you know. That said, I've ran into work colleagues here more than once, so perhaps people actually do enjoy this place but are not wiling to admit it due to the dive factor. I have no such reservation.

The karaoke equipment is outdated but for the most part sufficient, and song selection is what you'd expect at a dive.  There's a small patio in the back. Honestly there's not really anything great to say about this place other than that we ALWAYS have a blast here. Probably thanks to the amount of alcohol consumed. The people watching is pretty good too, actually."}
{"text":"By the gods I miss this place. Not only do the make the world's best Long Islands but the karaoke is to die for. This was a haven for the world's worst singer (namely me). The song selection is off the charts and the environment can't be beat. Its definitely one of those hidden gems but I'll take it over ANY nightclub in Ontario."}
{"text":"A bar with Firkin prices and  dive bar ambiance.

We went here for St. Paddy's day yesterday. The place had maybe 20 people in it and there was karaoke (every Thursday) happening. It was a mix of old, creepy regulars and cheap youngish people. Domestic beers are $4 a bottle, but everything else is $5 plus. Service was slow, as they only had one guy working.

My friends who have lived in the area for years admitted to only going there twice. There are way better bars in the area to waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. What a fantastic and warm place. Eclectic menu of Asian, Chinese and American food. All hand prepared and delicious. Parking nearby too. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Pros: Tasty food.

Cons: Tiny, tiny portions for the amount paid. We feel ripped off. 

Verdict: Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!!!!! Disgusting!!!
Sesame beef was disgusting! Chicken basil!!! Ewwww the chicken was full of cartilage and disgusting tissue..
Sweet and sour chicken was decent... But not good...  
Ew!!!!"}
{"text":"Best hidden little karaoke in the city!! 
Great food and 1000's of updated songs to choose from!!"}
{"text":"The fundamental flaw with this place is that they don't give a fudge.  Every time I eat here with co-workers, the general consensus is that it sucks monkey balls.  We always end up going back after a couple of months JUST because they have a patio.  They sell Chinese food and it just isn't good.  The wings are sub par as well. They wing sauce is watered down more than McDonald's fountain drinks  Its not BAD but it definitely ain't GOOD. The plain fried rice is just rice and soy sauce so I don't understand what makes THIS food, Chinese food.  Is it because a Chinese guy named Wang is the chef?!?!  The servers are usually nice and the food is cheap but... I mean, does that even matter if people say it 'sux monkeyballs???\""}
{"text":"I only ordered take out for this place but the atmosphere looked pretty dismal. Although it was a Monday night. Looked like it could be a place you can just hang out. 

I was hungover and searching for nearby Chinese food. This was not what I expected. It was even more westernized then \"Chinese\" food already is. Not what I was looking for but still good. My sweet and sour pork was done with a cornmeal coating which was tasty and not too \"MSG\" like. 

I'd get it again, knowing what I was in for."}
{"text":"We got delivery from this place last night, and honestly was the worst Pho I have tried.
The portion was so little, the broth was taste less, very little meat, tons of sprouts, little noodles. Super disappointed!
It was a very expensive Pho for the little amount and quality of food we got.
Never again!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh - divey karaoke bar serving Westernized Chinese food.  All their specials are not available while karaoke is on.  Don't fall for the bait and switch.  Selection of alcohol fits the 'diviness' but the prices don't.  Though admittedly, the song selection is quite good here."}
{"text":"Love this bar. The food is amazing and the karaoke is so much fun.  Super comfortable atmosphere and great clients. Would definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"great neighborhood bar down the street from our condo rental we went here several times during our vacation,  the first night there was no kareoke, however we ate with gusto.  we had the chicken wings, we only order 6 wings because we were not hungry, but we were so  impressed we decided to come back the next night for wings, but kareoke was included, and we had a good meal in addition to kareoke.  my chicken wings were great, i ordered them with medium sauce and they were on point, tender on the inside, crunchy on the outside and the sauce was spicy and slightly sweet.  my sister and our friend mary was dissatisified with their sauce they thought they had plain bbq sauce, but they thought the chicken was cooked just right.  we also ordered fried rice which was fresh and flavorful. just delicious.  we will end our trip here because we love the wings.  they are the best."}
{"text":"Was late at night so I opted for delivery via Uber Eats. Portion size is very small for the price. The rice portion was so small that it didn't fill the small container they put it In! I expect more when they charge extra for rice! There are better options in the city. The taste of the food was more like a food court experience than a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and reasonable. This is the best reason to go there. The place does not have a pleasing interior, but it is clean. Small patio out back. 

Karaoke is popular there and a very good diverse crowd normally attends. Limited number of staff but they manage and are very customer service orientated."}
{"text":"Probably the best chowmein and wings in the city-- crispy style, different from the hot wing categories you'll find at pubs
I grew up here getting delicious food and fun pg13 times 
Now as an adult I can't wait to come back and sing more karaoke and rock out on the new amazing patio!
Can't believe it's still such a favourite but it's just awesome !
Make sure you call and make sure the kitchen is open!
And hopefully karaoke is on when you come!
Cheap beer sometimes too woo hoo
They do Thai dishes too surprisingly nice!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came for karaoke on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. She has a couple other friends with birthdays close to hers so they all teamed up and brought their friends here. This made for a somewhat full bar. It would have been pretty sparse otherwise. I had fun, but it was because of the group I was with. If we had been with a smaller group I'm not sure this is the place I would want to hang out at for karaoke.

The drink prices are average. $4-7.50 for your standard beers and highballs. Tequila shots were $6. For such a dive-y place the drinks weren't cheap enough.

Some guys at the table next to us ordered some wings which looked and smelled really good. They highly suggested we try them. Unfortunately we did not.

To sum this place up: If you have a good sized group of people then this is a great spot for karaoke because you'll have no trouble finding a seat and having everyone get a turn at the mic. If you're just looking for a cheap place to hang out with your buddies, skip this one.

Oh yeah, they have a patio too.

{"text":"Kareoke on fri and sat. It gets busy. Surprisingly. i was here on a saturday and the place was packed with 4-5 groups of people/parties. the songs kept on going, and the drinks kept flowing. The song selection is a bit confusing and disorganized though as a friend of mind waited over an hour to go up while 3 people continually went up. the screens don't all work, and the ones that do are a bit fuzzy. it definitely has this divey kind of atmosphere, and seems like a total local hangout. I'd go back for someone else's birthday or something but probably not with my own devices."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Evelyn. I love weird, divey places. Nice to meet you. Hooray. 

I don't want to mislead you into thinking this place is great if you don't also like weird, so I'm going to go with three A-OK stars for On The Rocks. It seems to me most every night is Karaoke night, and it's pretty empty but the drinks are cheap, the whole place smells like delicious mozza sticks and the servers are very pleasant. 

Get riled up, and if you're on an accidental drink crawl in the east end, be sure to add this to your list, and bring the house down with some Oasis."}
