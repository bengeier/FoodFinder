{"text":"Inbetween a and b terminal 

Happened upon them as flight was in terminal a and usually grab food in main area.

Surprisingly the burger was great for what I thought I would get ....def recommend.
Even more of a surprise was the French onion soup.
Broth great.
Could have been number 1 or 2 overall if bread was better and cheese good not great. Broth dark and rich w plenty of onions , number 2 on my rank of best North America  for broth , number 3 overall."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this airport restaurant.  On June 16th, 2017, I stopped here for a quick slice of pizza.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni, but was charged for a \"Brnx Bombr,\" whatever that is.

At first, the cashier told me my total charge for the slice of pepperoni pizza and a small water was $8.00, but then she rang me up with a different total that came to $10.05.  When I inquired about the difference, the cashier became irate and ridiculed me for my question.  I was shocked and offended by the cashier's behavior.  She was very unprofessional.

The slice of pepperoni was $5.29 plus tax and was very greasy.  It reminded me of a $2.00 NYC slice.  The small Fiji water was $3.99 plus tax.  

Between the price, bad service and bad quality of food here, I do not recommend this airport restaurant."}
