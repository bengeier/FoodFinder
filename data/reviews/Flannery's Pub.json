{"text":"All good here...GREAT music playing, shepherds pie was out of this world and of course a great selection of whiskeys and bourbons. Bartenders were attentive and helpful. Keep it up and will definite be back"}
{"text":"Flannery's just updated their menu. I came here with my mother - a native Englishwoman - and she loved it. Smithwick's on tap is to die for, and their beef pie is incredible. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will definitely be making a return visit!"}
{"text":"Called to see if a table was available and the hostess was very rude. Didn't end up going because her attitude was so off putting."}
{"text":"Best bar for preface food and drinks.  Even on a busy night they we have been able to get a table.  Good food and close the progressive field and The Q."}
{"text":"Messed up on my order completely  Burger was not well done cooked as asked .  Got the wrong drink twice ! Had to get up and ask for fries which came with my order .  Bad experience"}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner seeking to watch the NFL playoffs somewhere other than my hotel room, the concierge at our hotel suggested Flannerys.  Nothing fancy (as expected for a sports bar), but server was cordial and timely, there were a great variety of beers and the blackened bleu cheeseburger was one of the bests I've had in a long time -- it had a heck of a spicey kick to it."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing to say the least. Uninspired pub that felt like they just didn't try to put forth some effort. Got onion rings and then the recommended fish and chips. Both dishes were coated in grease and that left an un-appetizing feel and taste overall. Rings were just standard fare with nothing special and the fish was just whatever. Fries were an absolute afterthought and that's one of my pet peeves. I can't stand it when restaurants mail it in on the fries. Nothing was absolutely horrible and that's why they got the 2 stars instead of 1. However, I was hoping for so much more from the other reviews and definitely recommend checking out the other restaurants in this neat area."}
{"text":"Nice place, nice atmosphere live entertainment in the evening.  Good selection of beer and Irish Whiskey.  Food was the normal Irish Pub stuff.  Shepard's Pie was below average."}
{"text":"This restaurant was close to our hotel, and after looking at the menu online we walked over for dinner.  The pub decor is nice, and lots of TVs for sports fans.  However, the food was disappointing, and the service was rushed.  I ordered the Lamb/Beef Stew, and it was okay.  My husband ordered chicken in lemon and wine sauce, which he described as mediocre, but did say the mashed potatoes served with it were good.  When we finished our meal, our waitress was ready for us to leave and said she 'assumed' that we didn't want dessert.  Actually, we did, and we ordered the cookies and milk ($4.99) and said we didn't want the milk.  We were charged the full price for the dessert on our check, and when we asked the waitress about it, she blew us off and said that it the price, regardless.  We felt like she was simply too busy to bother.   We definitely would NOT eat here again."}
{"text":"Huge space, nice patio and great beer selection.  We had Amy as a server and she was AWESOME!  So friendly, quick and she was able to offer up some suggestions for things to see on our trip to Cleveland. The pan-fried Mozzarella app is AMAZING.  I had it twice while there on the weekend ;) Different days, I promise ;) I also ordered the Penne and Cheese and it was delicious!  Smoked Gouda goodness!  Great pub! Great location! Great people!"}
{"text":"After many incidents that made our experience less than thrilling a conversation with the manager was requested. No solution was reached and the same 3 excuses were reiterated 3 times. After being tired of hearing the same excuses I had heard enough. No attempt to rectify, just excuses. This will be the first and last experience at this establishment."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I sat at the bar for ten minutes and wasn't waited on. I had to flag a bartender down in a bar that was not busy for a drink. I also asked to see a menu because I wanted food, not only did the menu sit in front of me for thirty mins, it was taken away and I was never asked if I wanted to order anything. Maybe if the bartend wasn't doing shots with her friends or running her mouth she would have seen me and acknowledged me being in their place of business. I'm a bartender myself and anytime I have new face at my bar I notice them no matter what!!! I'm highly disappointed and I promise to never return, I'm also going to call the manger and complain as well."}
{"text":"Myself and some others visited on a busy Saturday night, packed house.  Fortunately we found some seats at the bar.  I didn't get the Irish pub feel that is advertised. The service and food were ok, not a bad experience and average bar quality food."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Service was a little slow, but fortunately we were not in a hurry.  The Guinness Beer Battered Fish sandwich I had was excellent."}
{"text":"It seems like Flannery's is one of the last \"regular\" places downtown where you can go in, have some pub fare and a few drinks and leave happy. I've been to the bar many times, with all types of people, at all different times, and it always feels comfortable. The good is fine (nothing fancy), the drink is good and there's almost always a new friend to make. The live music on weekends just sweetens the deal."}
{"text":"Had Irish stew, superb. Corned beef & cabbage, awesome. Pint (or two, 3) of Guinness, perfect. If you're fortunate enough to be seated in Mary's area you will definitely have a great time!"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour and lunch!  Great fish and chips and the Old Bay wings are awesome!  Good atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Just tried to have the wings. They were gross.   I feel like this is the kind of place that you come to drink, not to eat.   You know what? Irish bars in __(inset city____ are generally rubbish.   I'm happy to not seek them out any longer."}
{"text":"This bar was in close proximity to the hotel we were staying in. It was a good place to grab delicious food or good beers. I had a burger one day, and went back and had a chicken sandwich the next day. My wife really enjoyed the homemade mac n cheese. If I'm ever back in CLE, I'll go back and enjoy another meal here."}
{"text":"Perfecte plek voor een drankje of een snelle maaltijd voor of na een bezoek aan een wedstrijd van de Indians of de Cavaliers. De fish & chips waren goed. Ze hebben veel verschillende soorten bier, zowel op tap als in fles."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service ever. If they set out to try to be awful, they could n or be worse."}
{"text":"This place has horrible management. Stopped before a Indians game. Food took FOREVER. In fact we never received our food. Explained to waitress when we sat down that we were going up game, no problem...we will have you you out in no time. Had a beer each and ordered onion rings which came out 1/2 hour into sitting down and tasted like that had been sitting for awhile. 45 min later and still no food manager comes over and offers to do NOTHING. We told him we did not want to wait. Our bill came and it looked like he comped us, well just looked at bank statement and they charged my card $22.00. What a horrible way to run a business. Would never return. And will tell all I know the same."}
{"text":"Ahhhh this place was perfect right before the Tribe game. It was July 4 and not many places were open, and Flannerys had the lowest wait. Figure it was worth a try. Loved the classic Irish potato salad and the Reubano sandwich was great. Worth taking a look at if you like good Irish cuisine on 4th street right before a game at Progressive or the Q."}
{"text":"I normally don't do anything like this, but I felt compelled to post that I had the absolute worst customer service experience I have ever had at this bar, this evening.   While the majority of the staff were extraordinary helpful, one of the bartenders, Jen, was the rudest person I have ever encountered. She literally went out of her way to be rude to my friends and I, and because of her this bar has permanently lost me as a customer.   I am extremely disappointed because when I complained about how rude she was to the bar manager his response was \"I know.\"   I will never be back."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for 10 minutes while 3 bartenders kept walking by without acknowledging me. Horrible service but the food was alright"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Sunday before an event at Quicken Loans Arena. I looked up places in the area and this one sounded like a good place for a drink and food beforehand. I ordered the Bloody Mary on the server's recommendation that it was the best in town...no. It was not good, at all. My fiance and I both ordered food and after about 10 minutes our server came back and said they were out of both things that we ordered. He then acted a little annoyed that we didn't want to order anything else, but never came back so we left some cash for the drinks and left. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went there on a weeknight and it wasn't really busy. The patio is roomy and includes a smoking section.I had the teriaki wings that were good and the server was friendly. However I was kind of annoyed that after I ate he immediately brought the check, umm maybe I'd like to have another beer?  (And no, it wasn't like they were closing in 5 minutes). Overall, I would come back but just with that minor improvement."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Real Irish bar setting.  Fun watching games there!  Have to try the rueben with tater tots."}
{"text":"Called in a last minute large party of 20 late on a Monday night. Managers Nikki and Chris were MORE than accommodating. They were great hosts, organized, and made us feel very welcome. We arrived around 11pm, stayed until close and we didn't get a hard push to get out of there."}
{"text":"No Shock Top, out of Samuel Smiths completely, and get this, NO GREAT LAKES DORTMUNDERS!  Hello, we're in Cleveland! Place is really going downhill man..."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my sub-par experience here at Flannery's Pub. I was taking my date to her first Cavs game and was looking for somewhere to wet our whistles before going to the game. We spotted Flannerys and noticed several other Cavs fans going there, so we decided to give it a try. I think one word can sum up our experience here: ratchet. We ordered some beers and a flatbread pizza to start off. The flatbread left much to be desired, it was room temperature, the chicken tasted of charcoal, and the sauce was a poor attempt at a chipotle BBQ. But the real crime here wasn't the flatbread, it was the appearance of the staff. One waitress in particular thought it would be ok to let her cans hang loose and free. I watched in horror as she took the order of a family sitting next to us, dangling her breasts in front of a small child as he was trying to decide what to drink. I thought this was supposed to be a family-friendly atmosphere, but the staff dressed as if they were working at Hooters. One last thing, my date considers herself to be a wine aficionado and when she ordered a glass of the house red she was disgusted. I tried a bit of it myself, the legs were atrocious and it tasted like they watered it down. Needless to say I won't be going here again. Next time I think we'll try the Happy Buffalo."}
{"text":"Flannery's has the best meatloaf I think I have ever had. Must be ordered with a side of corn beef. Garlic mash complimented well. Fabulous dinner with a great atmosphere. Great service, great food. When in town, it's a \"have to go to\"."}
{"text":"I'm a Cleveland gal who used to follow the New Barleycorn (Irish band) around, so naturally I've spent my fair share of time and money at Flannery's. I want it all back!!!  Time and money, that is.  We live in Chicago (hubby, baby and me). We invited my in-laws to Cleveland for the Feast, and some NBC at Flannery's. We were discouraged 3 times on the phone from coming in, stating they were booked solid, we could walk in and take a chance, or we could try and stand in the bar area, but at 8 on a Saturday it would fill up. Well, with baby in tow, we made the trek in taking our chances. The bar was empty. There were empty tables in the dining room all over the place. The hostess told us she could seat us in a snug, but we wouldn't see the band.  Did they even want the business?  We could see the band, so it all worked out until we met our server. The extra lemons we asked for took two requests. The HP sauce was asked for 3 times. (Naturally the mediocre food is now cold waiting on the HP), and the salad was delivered without its star- the chicken. What is going on here? The food was bland and service on the verge of annoyed that we wanted to spend money there and tip them.   I don't get it. And Flannery's won't either. My time and money, that is."}
{"text":"Had a cobb salad that was quality. The bar is spacious. Its constantly busy, however, and the view out the window is of demoed buildings.  OK, that's not totally fair to the place, but what are you gonna do. The sheer amount of people in this bar is staggering. There were so many people I was elbow to elbow and constantly hitting people. Its not my type of place, way too energetic. But the beer selection is good. Overall, its a nice place to get a table at and nurse a beer for a while over food with friends and not the place to go drink late night and watch a game if you actually want to pay attention to what's going on or hear your friend sitting 3 inches from your ear."}
{"text":"The fish and chips & Long Island iced tea I ordered weren't great. I had left a 10% tips - CASH on top of the bill and yet they still charged me a 20% tips extra to my credit card. I would rather donate the $ to the needy ones, like charities. If the pub needs 'charity' , please improve on the standard of their food and drinks. This is unreasonable. I WILL NEVER STEP INTO THAT PUB AGAIN."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pub-type restaurants I've been to. The food was extremely good, they had plenty of drink options, and the service was very good as well."}
{"text":"stopped here before a show on playhouse square and it was great,. staff was very friendly, food was good and the outside patio was nice. the only reason i didnt give it 5 starts is that the bathroom was not clean. I just a had a burger and fruit and my husband the fish and chips we were both happy with our meals."}
{"text":"Went here around 10:45 on Saturday night. It was pretty busy, but we were able to grab a seat at the bar. The bartender came right over & we had our drinks within 5 minutes. Good atmosphere & crowd. Nothing fancy but they have a gold beer selection & full bar. Not too expensive by downtown standards either"}
{"text":"Good: Love the authentic Irish pub feel. The taps and pouring of a Guinness stout is perfect. Wood bar is respectful. Great overall atmosphere. Great bartenders.   Bad: I'm shocked - people can't even have a conversation with the annoying banging noise of ske-ball right off the bar. Seriously?  Is this an Irish bar or an arcade?  Might  as well peddle Cotton candy and stuffed giraffes. Disappointing. Time to find remember your Irish roots guys.   Also - where is the music?"}
{"text":"I have been going to Flannery's Pub for about 20 years, at least. I have gone for lunch, dinner, late night snacks and for good, old fashioned drink-ups. I have also spent many St. Patrick's Day's at Flannery's.   The bar staff are very friendly and pour a nice pint of Guinness. They also make really good (by good, I mean strong) mixed drinks. Of, course they also have many options for beer on tap.   The food menu offers many options from soups/salads, to wraps and sandwiches. They also have more traditional Irish food entrees and American fare. As a vegetarian, I never worry at Flannery's. The chef, Willie, is always willing to alter a recipe to accommodate what I am in the mood for.   Flannery's is a nice size pub. They have a nice big bar area, an area for live mi sic, and plenty of tables. I have been a part of very large parties at Flannery's and they were able to serve us all with ease."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices, true Irish pub. Knowledgable staff that know this Irish liquors! Great appetizers and desserts too! Nice after work stop"}
{"text":"Had a couple of burgers. They were great.  Had a couple of great draft beers.  Service was great.  Recommend a visit."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland. We went here after a comedy show and they weren't busy... yay! However,  couldn't get anyone to serve us. Not even a hi"}
{"text":"Wow this place was great. I had the spicy garlic wings. They were delicious and they were a nice size and juicy too, not those little pigeon ones, We often find.   I had the garlic burger it was also delicious and cooked to order. Here is why only 4 stars. The burger did not reach the edge of the bun! This is a pet peeve of mine. A burger should get to the edge all the way around. Nothing worse than an empty bun.   They have a great selection of draft and bottled beer.   The staff was prompt and courteous, for a Thursday they were quite busy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during a business trip, and it was terrible. I had the lamb/beef stew, and it was mush. Our server was rude about giving us separate checks. The whole restaurant was empty, so he wasn't busy at all. I'd definitely skip this place if I ever go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it 4 but it had some issues. Visiting from Las Vegas and Cali in our group. Came to watch worl cup while on our trip. Great bartenders but sad they we're out of a lot of beers on tap and bottles. Especially local brews.  Bartender informed us they had a big night the day before because of the Indians game against Detroit. If you know that's such a big game for you management have enough to handle the excess. It's not fresh produce that will go bad. Had the mushrooms those were pretty delish. Their version of skins not so much.  Enjoyed the some pool until we were told the bar was closing early because they were out of too much product!?!? Uh what kind of Irish pub runs out of booze......again great bartenders  not their fault management."}
{"text":"Flannery's is NOT, i repeat, NOT open till 2am. My girlfriend and I just went there before 1am and it was closed. Seems all of downtown Cleveland shuts down at midnight, but they CLAIM to be open till 2."}
{"text":"Jen stabbed me in the ass with the Fat Head tap handle. If you like getting stabbed in the ass Flannery's is the place to be, just ask for Brad!! Love you Jen."}
{"text":"Went in for a snack on a sat night.   Bar area was pretty pack, restaurant side was pretty dead.   Sat in the restaurant side.   Service was non existent as the section was dead and the server would disappear after bringing the food.   Typical bar food,  nothing special."}
{"text":"Great service by Tim. Food sucked. Overcooked pork, shoe leather is easier to eat. Cobb salad had green eggs and brown avacados.  Yum.  The pork was a recommendation too. Sad."}
{"text":"Flannery is a name that any real Clevelander will recognize! This place is close to The Q and Progressive, which makes it a good game watching bar/restaurant, as well as a good before game/after game hang out. It's also right in the middle of tons of other restaurants and bars, which makes it a great location if you're wanting to bar hop. The food is pretty great as well, especially the fried cheese. The drink selection is standard, yet large and prices are fair. This bar also has an outdoor area where they serve beer for busier days. It can get rather loud inside, but obviously this is relative to what time you go to the bar and if there is a game going on downtown. Additionally, it is really spacious and they have great hours!"}
{"text":"Tim the bartender was amazing. However, we're extremely disappointed that you got rid of wings. Your buffalo sauce is the reason we came to get drinks. Bring them back!! Every please needs wings!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland and initially had a hard time finding anything open.  When we found this place it was... fine.    We each had two good beers, served cold with minimum interaction from the bartender.  We also ordered the prime rib skewers.  The were tasty and the horseradish cream sauce that they came with was quite good, but not remarkable.  We were just underwhelmed by the entire experience.   I am sure that this is a place that has plenty of regulars and if we lived nearby it might become a place that we would visit frequently, but for this trip, it was just a good place to waste an hour."}
{"text":"Have always loved a beer or two at this wonderful pub. Today was the first day I've not had a liquid diet at this venue.  Stuffed mushrooms \"shrooms\" on the menu - holy fried and breaded thrice. Not something I would order again - very flavorful but anything this fried would be good.  Three thumbs up for the Irish stew - lamb stew that warms the soul.  Fish and chips - too much breading. Fries tasted like they were fresh out of the freezer with the freezer burnt flavor to add. Disappointing from a pub.   Ruben sandwich - dripping with grease- friend who orders always finishes, but left half the sandwich on lonely island.   Rarely will I leave without a box to go when food is leftover .... When asked if we wanted a box definitely declined.  Service very amazing. Great place to drink. Eat if you want stew. Leave if you want something not involving liquid."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have a large bar with lots of beers on tap, as well as a great menu.  They also have a nice outdoor patio.  It's close to the Cavs and Indians and there are lots of TVs.  Definitely a good time."}
{"text":"Part of my Cleveland NCAA experience.  Adjacent to the Q with all the bar amenities.  Plenty of TV's at any angle, plenty of beer at good prices, plenty of food stuff at good prices, plenty of sandwiches at great prices, and plenty of action.  What more could a fan ask for?  The bathrooms were clean and you can tell have been maintained; you can imagine how much action they get.  There are plenty of places to go in the area of the Q, and this is one of them."}
{"text":"You won't find a better Irish Pub without hopping the pond and visiting one in Ireland. It's the perfect place to grab a bite or just hang out and watch a game.   The bartenders here take pride in their work and can pour a Guinness properly. Even though I prefer the Yuengling here, I did notice and try the Guinness. I can't say enough good things about the staff here. I got to know a few of them, fantastic people.  I've had a few meals here and was never disappointed. Fish and chips, Irish stew, and the Guinness mushrooms stand out as favorites for me. Keep in mind this is pub food so if you're craving gourmet, eat somewhere else and come here for a drink afterwards.   This is one of my favorite pubs to hang out in while in Cleveland. It's walking distance to Progressive field so expect a large crowd when the Tribe plays at home."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of people before a concert at Progressive Field. It is a great location for a pre-game to Progressive, the Q, or even the House of Blues.   The place is large but gets packed. It's a popular spot. We were able to snag an empty table and even had a very attentive server despite all the pre-concert chaos going on around us.   Between 8 people we ordered 4 apps: stuffed mushrooms, Irish loaded nachos, a cheese board, and Irish fondue.   The stuffed mushrooms were TO. DIE. FOR. They are stuffed and then deep fried. Crunchy on the outside, creamy and full of flavor inside. Everyone agreed they were phenomenal. The Irish loaded nachos were also delicious. Thin cut potatoes acting as tortilla chips, bacon, cheese from the fondue, and scallions.   The other two apps were just okay but I would absolutely eat the mushrooms and nachos again.   After several rounds of drinks for all 8 of us, and our 4 apps, we got our bill which was remarkably reasonable for being at a restaurant so close to the field and ordering so many drinks, which are usually overpriced in areas like this. We were all surprised and pleased.   This place is definitely a win!"}
{"text":"The bar offers strongbow on tap.   I love to come to Flannerys on St. Paddy's day on Cavs game nights. There tends to be men there!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a couple drinks and food. The staff was friendly and nice environment. I had the Reuben which was very good."}
{"text":"Great pub to hit up when you're downtown for a sports game, but I went today for lunch and just wasn't super impressed. The signature dish, Fish and Chips, was insanely over breaded to the point that I had to pull it off and eat it in pieces with the fish. Apart, both parts were very good, but it was just so thick I couldn't enjoy it as much. On the bright side, they do great layered beers (Black and Tans, Black Velvet), and my boyfriend loved the bangers and mash (he said it needed more mash though - too many veggies)."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here.  Staff was extremely friendly. It was so nice to see everyone who walked through the door was welcomed.  Prices are decent, had a beer and BBQ chicken tenders and potatoes which were sooooo yummy!  Next time I come Back to Cleveland I will be back!"}
{"text":"It's an Irish bar.  One would think the guitar player would sing Irish themed music...not your average cool guy with a guitar type songs.  So, strike one there.  Strike two, the drinks are way over priced for the size of the glass.  And strike three, worst bread pudding EVER.  It was dried out, tasted SOUR of all things and the giant white lump on the top it's not vanilla ice cream, my friends - it's pure butter.  Yes, I was the one to discover that."}
{"text":"This place is crap. A couple of friends and myself wandered into Flannerys around 9pm on a Saturday night. We couldnt tell if it was still a restaurant or bar at this time. We seated ourselves at a table. From 9pm-10:30pm we had no one come and greet us. We had to go up to the bar twice for our own drinks. We had several waitresses walk past us with cold looks on their faces. It was obvious they wanted to be somewhere else. We over heard a table next to us complaining about the service as well. I guess apparently the kitchen was closed. A manager approached the table next to us, I asked if we could get a waitress... and he responded \"Yea yea I'll send one over.\" No one ever came. This place sucks. Stay away... sucks I even have to give 1 star."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience (Courtney was awesome), the food was good and the street patio is a great place to eat this time of year. On to the Playhouse Square for Motown!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice when I was in town for my cousins wedding.  Both times the service was fast and friendly, and the food was excellent.  Also loved the decor, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, however the service was absolutely terrible. Don't go there on a busy day."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink prior to an Indians game and had a great time relaxing on the patio and enjoyed one of the many great beers they had on tap. This faux Irish bar in the epicenter of downtown Cleveland  and has decent prices for a before game beverage."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Friday afternoon. Sat inside however you can sit outside as well. Service was really fast and friendly. Had the garlic burger which was phenomenal. My niece had the fish and chips which she loved. Other family members had sandwiches and salads and everything was delicious and the portion size was decent (you could definitely split a sandwich)."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional Irish food.  Has the Harp cheese soup, rueben and banger and mash.  All of them were great.  Many beers on tap.  Although I forgot our servers name,  probably dur to all the beer.  She was great!!!  Necer had to look for her, she even brought out the cook when we were asking about different dishes."}
{"text":"oh-ho-ho!!!!!  Yes, this is the place to start it all off!  Part of a self-directed Pub Crawl in Gateway District,  Flannery's was the start of the crawl and a very worthy opening pint it was!  I had the guinness (of course) and really enjoyed everything about the place.  Food was very good, service was excellent, atmosphere was fun and lively.  This is a perfect start to a wobbly evening on foot!"}
{"text":"I ended up twice here in one weekend because it was in walking distance of where I was staying, and because this place pours a good Guinness. Some of the best Guinness I've had in a long time. Probably too good, because I definitely drank too much of it.  I had the portobello sandwich, which was also good. A decent bar in a fun area, it's worth stopping in for a pint or two."}
{"text":"A decent experience offset by the bland food.  With that said, I still had a good time.  The bangers and mash were bland, with the highlight being the bangers themselves. Everything else was horribly bland! The beer prices were fair, and the staff was pretty awesome.   This has potential for 4 stars if the food were better.  Maybe it was just an off night?  **UPDATE** Went back the next night to try a burger.  It was awesome.  I am officially moving it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner and drinks here on a Sunday night. Food was good, friendly service, and prompt. We will likely come back next time we are in town. Solid."}
{"text":"Went here after a day at the Rock and Roll HOF.  Hostess seated us immediately in a comfortable booth.   My wife and son ordered the Shepperds Pie which was good , but with very little meat in it. It,came with a large portion of broccoli  I ordered a Ribeye soaked in Guiness with a sauce on top that was skimpy. It came with delicious Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli.   The drinks were good and the service was, also.    Surprised no rolls or Irish Soda Bread was offered with dinner.  I would return because of the location, but the food could improve a little bit."}
{"text":"We went there for a cold one or two and the selection was great. The place was dead that evening, but that gave us time to converse with the bartender.  A scary guy with a briefcase was sitting nearby for a while and he made some strange comments.  Thankfully he left and we didn't have to be looking over our shoulder.     The highlight of the evening was the black man in the bathroom. He stood watching me and handed me a paper towel and put his hand out.  He was dirty and he had no colognes or gum or other items, just standing there.  I apologized for not having any cash (which is what everyone should do in those situations unless the guy is well dressed and well stocked with useful items).  I told the bartender I didn't understand why they had a homeless looking bathroom attendant on a dead evening and he jumped up and ran the man out to the street.  I guess this is to be expected in a downtown bar.  A great old bar with a good selection of beers is worth checking out, I am sure the crazy people are not always so obvious, I tend to attract them for some damn reason."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Cavs game.  At first was annoying cuz the TVs were not in sync and the bar was cheering about 5 seconds before we knew what was going on.  But with enough nudging they fixed the problem.    I just kinda wanted to say I got chicken tenders here (or chicken phalanges as I call them) and they were really good.    Oh and Lebron with that miracle shot was awesome and to watch everyone leaving the Q and celebrate was entertaining.  Prime people watching spot."}
{"text":"So, one evening on our way to Hilarities we decided to take in the culinary sights nearby, and we happened into Flannery's.  I'm glad we did:)   Flannery's is a large-scale version of the traditional style Irish Pub, with a fine selection of whiskies and beers on tap that will satisfy a variety of tastes (my wife likes their Guinness.)  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and that leads me to the food.  My wife got the fish and chips, which was MASSIVE, and she really enjoyed it. I got the Bangers and Mash, which I'd never had before, and was really impressed. You'd expect sausages to be heavy, but not these; they were light, and on a bed of peas and corn with a wonderful centerpiece of garlic mashed potatoes. It was great:)  The prices aren't bad, and for parking, there are a few local garages nearby, and the restaurant is close to downtown (by foot if necessary,) so if you want to get a taste of the Irish before a show, a game, or just on it's own, give Flannery's a try for a real Irish Treat!"}
{"text":"my friend and i got the ruben.  he got fries.  i got onion rings.  ruben was very, very good.  didnt have any sauerkraut on them though but still very tasty.  his fries were nice and crisp and my onion rings could legally qualify as hand fruit.  enormous. and they bit apart nicely.  didnt pull out the whole onion out of the breading in the first bite.  sad part, only 3 of them.  sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather that day.  good service."}
{"text":"liked this place a lot. strong drinks, good service. the mac and cheese w/ chicken was delicious. I'd love to go there again :)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and affordable. The Irish coffee is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I was afraid that I'd get mediocre food and service at first glance, considering it's near the House of Blues bar/pub strip and usually these places focus more on drinks than dining. However, I was pleased to find that Flannery's delivered positively on both my concerns.  I was seated immediately on a Friday evening, early enough to not be stuffed with bar patrons, but still well attended. Service was spot on and quick - almost a little TOO quick. I ordered the ham and cheese soup and the corned beef and cabbage and no sooner did my spoon hit the soup then my entree was out. Luckily it was steaming so by the time I got to it it was at the perfect temperature. The waitress, Rosa, apologised for it coming out so quick, she said she put them in separately, but I guess the kitchen was just that quick.  Anyway, to the food - ham and cheese soup, exactly as it sounds. Good sharp cheddar broth enhanced with a good beer, nice chunks of potato and carrot with super delicious smokey, salty ham. Perfect balance, soup was not too thick nor too thin and everything cooked perfectly. Also loved the crisp parmesan crostini - only thing better would've been a chunk of Irish soda bread.  The corned beef was flavorful, thick, and tender with just the right amount of fat cap left. The cabbage and carrots were bland - when I cook my veggies I do so with the beef so it gets some flavor - wish they would have done the same. At least they were well cooked, firm but not mucky. The smashed redskin potatoes were excellent, THERE was the flavor I wanted, and nicely accented with scallions.  Good portions - $5 for the \"cup\" of soup which was really a bowl and $11 for the corned beef which was easily taken home for another meal. I think if I get back there before I leave town I'll have to try the fish and chips, anything battered in Guiness has to be good."}
{"text":"The food was great and the drinks however the $50 preauthorization when I handed over my credit card, the $17 receipt and waiting for five days to get the balance back into my account was the worst service I've ever come across around the country. I HAVE NEVER in 39 years of eating out had to pay ahead of time....unless there was that time in the South when u jnew they were being racist! Never going back!"}
{"text":"This is another \"American Irish\" bar. This does not resemble a traditional Irish pub, and the food isn't authentic either, for example: Shepherd's Pie is made with ground lamb not beef. And since when has Chicken Marsala been a traditional Irish dish? I know I'm being picky but still... I opted for the fish and chips, and was disappointed with the quality of the fish and the over-cooked FRIES, not chips. The reuben was \"just ok.\" The service was good, and the place had a nice atmosphere. Extensive beer list too."}
{"text":"It's solidly average, with the appropriate wood, flat-panel TVs and pop music playing.  My visit was pleasant enough, though it was quite crowded for my tastes.  I'm not a fan of being crowded out so much.  The fare was fair, and rather americanized;  but that's hardly shocking.  I can't say that I'm eager to return, but their location is difficult to miss and reasonably convenient all things considered."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything much more than an irished themed Applebee's...but I was wrong. The food was very good (I got the corned beef dinner, and BF got Sheppard's pie). And I washed it down with a slice of chocolate cheesecake. Service was great, too."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, because I'm so bedazzled by the rest of 4th street.  However, can I say this place is typically good food, good service, good beer?    Lots of comfort food.  Oh yes... mmmm.    I really like this place.  I wish I could remember it fast enough, and not get sucked into the Pickwick and Frolic/Hilarities buzz everytime I'm on 4th street.   Actually, I've spent many an evening here instead of going to an Indians game.  Well, really... who wouldn't?  Kidding Indians fans... Kidding!"}
{"text":"This place is always a great time.  Great location and great beers!  I jump at the chance to go here."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the first USA game in the World Cup. It's an official world cup pub, so I recommend this place if you want to watch with other fans!  When downtown is busy (Indians games, Cavs, etc), I would suggest walking/biking/uber/lyft to beat the expensive parking and traffic since it's at a pretty popular spot downtown (E 4th and Prospect).  Onto the pub itself - it's an Irish pub with lots of options for Irish-y food and sandwiches. We got the fish and chips, which was PLENTIFUL for the price. Shared it with my husband. It's pretty oily though - just an FYI. It comes with fries (chips) and coleslaw (just ok - not too much flavor.) It was decent-above average pub food.  They have a pretty good selection on draught too. Unfortunately, they ran out of newcastle that night. Sad.    I would come back for sports but not necessarily because of the food."}
{"text":"We only had drinks here before the baseball game so I can only rate on that. Service was great, very attentive. They have a very wide variety of different kinds of liquors and luckily, the ones we were interested in. The atmosphere was cool too, very Irish pub, like their name suggests. It was crowded because it was a game night it we ended up finding a spot at the bar, which was nice. We'd go back if we are ever in the area again"}
{"text":"Not good enough to rave about and not bad enough to pan.  Food was so-so, although my hubby did enjoy his fish and chips, service was OK, and atmosphere was pretty average. Not saying I would not eat there again, but I wouldn't be seeking it out either."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch with friends. Service was spot on. My bourbon cocktail was nice and strong. I loved the prime dip sandwich with both au jus and horseradish sauce. Great steak fries too and perfectly done. I wanna go back!"}
{"text":"This place is less than 500 feet from my apartment so simple proximity makes it A-OK in my book.  The drinks are average and cheap, and I'd say the crowd is the same.  This is a place where people come to just have a good time.  I have to say, Flannery's has yet to disappoint.  I love that you can roll in here in some designer jeans, a killer shirt, a cropped leather jacket and some to-die-for heels and look  like you're supposed to be there, even if the person next to you is just hanging out in a Browns shirt from 1986 and some faded Wranglers.  What also boosts this place from three to four stars is the fact that is has a proper pool table set away from the crowded main area that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to use.  Also, their patio offers up a pretty prime location for people watching."}
{"text":"Stopped after the pink concert and left after waiting 25 minutes without anyone stopping at our table to even get us a drink.  Never ever had that kind of horrible service ever and I travel a lot"}
{"text":"Wish I could do a 3 & 1/2. Great service, atmosphere, and beer selection on tap.   I only had the corn beef and cabbage but it was the driest I've ever had. At an Irish pub this should be spot on. Other than that, I would come back to try some other entrees!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an evening drink , we sat outside so as to enjoy the sights and sounds . Our wait staff was very friendly , recommended several things to do while visiting . Did not sample the food, but from the menu it appears to be standard pub grub .  Great grab a drink and hang out pub ."}
{"text":"Great, fun place! I came here on a Wednesday night around 6pm and it was hopping. I was also with a group of 9 and we didn't make reservations (not sure if they do reservations though). We waited for about 40 minutes, but ordered drinks at the bar while we waited. It wasn't too bad. We ended up being split between two tables that were next to each other so we could be seated faster. Our waitress was great. She was friendly, funny, and sassy in a good way. She helped recommend a new beer for my friend and I which was the Magnolia? I think that's what it was called. We then ordered right away and I got the Fish and Chips. YUM. It was perfectly cooked and the fresh potato slices made it even better. This place has a very cozy atmosphere, and everyone looked to be having a great time. It's also right next to East 4th street and Public Square. After we ate, we walked around downtown and saw all the Christmas lights. Great restaurant, but can be very crowded."}
{"text":"I went to Flannerys pub recently and ordered a steak...I asked for it to be cooked medium...and when we got our food, the waitress walked away before asking me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked to my liking and it was definitely over cooked and dry...and I should have sent it back but our waitress didn't come back in a short amount of time, and I was hungry....im not hard to please as long as my order is correct...so I will go back there...but ill never order a steak ever again..."}
{"text":"Have to say I wasn't impressed. Hubby and I went here after expressing a craving for a really good burger. He got the chili cheeseburger, and I got the black n bleu burger. My husband thought the chili didn't have enough flavor, and my burger just didn't have anything to really make it stand out in my opinion. We both agreed that this place seems a bit safe... A place you can go if you're too scared to try the more gourmet offerings in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Place is OK.  Definitely not a traditional Irish pub--more of a sports bar.  I had the Flannery Burger that was pretty good.  Not overcooked and had a nice smokiness coming from the Andouille sausage.  The Caesar salad was forgettable--aside from being misspelled in the menu.  ;-)  Overall, for the price, not a bad meal but not so memorable that I would return."}
{"text":"My visit to this classic Irish pub was a winner!  Inside Flannery's they've got a lot of space in classic polished woods but my visit brought me outside to their sidewalk patio.  With a nice selection of beer here, quaffing a Speckled Hen on a great Sunday afternoon was a little bit of heaven.  Flannery's menu is typical Irish pub with a bunch of hearty sandwiches and appetizers.  I went with the beer battered onion rings and the honey-mustard chicken sandwich.    The onion rings were a great starter.  A large platter of well, browned puffy rings served with some suitably spicy sauce!  Some of the best rings I've had in a while and a touch greasy but very well-fried and delicious.  The chicken sandwich was quite good with thick-cut bacon and nicely melted cheese along with some decent fries.  Overall I think Flannery's is a solid Irish pub with a classic food menu and excellent beer list.  But after eating at so many of these places it's hard to separate one as being better than others.  So 3.5 stars for Flannery's and unfortunately I won't be back for another visit anytime soon to round it up..."}
{"text":"Went here to grab some food with a friend of mine. Decor is defintely an Irish pub, great selection of beers. Warm, cozy feeling, if you are looking for a place to chill with some friends then this is the place for you. They got plenty of tables, booths, and room. My friend ordered their German Beer called Weihenstephaner. I just had a Leinenkugels. Both tasted great. For food, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip plus their turkey club wrap with fries. The dip had the right amount of spice and tasted great but the chips were a bit old. The turkey club was also okay and it wasn't a wow factor for me. It's mediocre. The coleslaw that came with it was very watery as well. The fries tasted alright as well but not as crispy as I like it to be but tolerable.   I give it a 4 stars because we were sitting out by the patio which was closer to the guy that was playing acoustic guitar. The music wasn't as loud and it was actually perfect for the ears. The only bad thing is that when we first walked in, there was no hostess so we sort of just walked in ourselves and sat ourselves. Well that didn't really help much because we didn't get service so we actually looked for the hostess.   The location is convenient, it's right across from the Q and by E 4th Street which has other selection of bars. Parking across the street is about $5 or you can do valet by e 4th."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time ever going there and here's my experience:  * SO many amazing beers on tap I had never heard of before. Got a phenomenal hard cider from Ireland.  * Had their stew, and honest to god, THE BEST stew I have ever had in my entire life. The taste was phenomenal and all the meat and veggies were perfect and tender.  * The bar staff was SUPER attentive to myself and lady friend. They were semi-busy but I never had to stand at the bar for more than a few minutes to get help.  * My bill was $31.00 for: a beer, a burger and fries, a huge bowl of stew, and a side Caesar salad. AMAZING price. I rarely ever look at the price of food before the final bill comes out and I was more than pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and attentive, good bar atmosphere.  Had the bangers and mash, but was disappointed.  Overall nice atmosphere and a nice place to watch sports."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Flannery's in years.  I opted to meet a co-worker here for lunch.  Nice lunch selection, including a pick \"2\" option for $8 or \"3\" for $11.  I chose the 1/2 Turkey Club on Ciabatta bread and the Cranberry Walnut Salad.   The Club sandwich was just ok, the salad was pretty tasty with chicken, nice mix of spring greens and white balsamic dressing, lots of cranberries and candied walnuts.   I would absolutely return for the salad selection."}
{"text":"While I did not have any of the traditional Irish food, i did enjoy my meal. I enjoyed the Black and Blue burger with a cold pint of Boddingtons. It does not get much better than that."}
{"text":"Food was great and filling! Exceptional service as well! I recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink or two--not so great place to order food. If it were based solely on drinks, I would give 4 stars. Nice casual spot on E4th that has your typical Irish feel. Nice wood word, nice drink choice. Flannery's is that perfect place to either start or end your night."}
{"text":"Downtown Irish pub across the street from the Cavaliers stadium. Had the usual Irish dishes plus American deli sandwich staples, salads and a few hamburgers. Chose the Colcannon soup--something I hadn't had before so no idea if Flannery's is authentic. Potato-based with chopped kale, cabbage and leek cooked in, it was tasty though the potato abundance made it as thick as oatmeal.  My shepherd's pie was more like a hamburger gravy with a thin layer of mashed potatoes atop.  Chose Guinness chocolate cake for dessert. The small brick of cake had a heavy cocoa flavoring and rather dry taste, with a paste of chocolate icing that didn't quite mate with the cake.  The meal was just lackluster.  Turned up here as the Cavs were warming up and commented on missing the Tuesday rush. \"Yeah, but we weren't very busy,\" the hostess replied."}
{"text":"Terrible.   Service: We saw our waitress 4 times in the hour and a half we were there; for our drink order, food order, food, and check. Our drinks were empty the whole time. Then she shorted us change at the end on top of it. To ask for the proper change would have meant waiting for her for another 20min.   Food: Boyne Valley Rolls were good, but nothing I'd go recommending the restaurant for. It took us an hour after the appetizer to get our 2 meals. We were starving by then, and ended up with fast food quality food. I got a steak sandwich that I ordered medium rare that came well done and tasted like a whopper from BK (only it cost $10 more). Everything came out cold, but our waitress never came back to check on us, so my starving boyfriend just sucked it up and ate it anyway. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place seems to be the gathering point before every Cavs game and it is always packed.  Despite the high beer prices and the crowds, they never have enough staff and you'll be lucky if you can get in more than one beer in an hour before the game.  They seem to have taken advice from the comedians down the street and leave them wanting more but I don't know that it is the best approach in this situation."}
{"text":"Awesome chill spot.....loved my drinks good prices at that!! Gin & Tonic . They serve food as well my cousin had the Mac- N-chicken."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland for the evening and wanted to get a quick, but tasty bite to eat before the Indians game. We were afraid that there would be long waits at places near the stadium, but walked into Flannery's and were seated on the patio, almost immediately. Our server Sarah, was great.   Great beer selection. Locals, as well as your typical domestics and imports that you'd find any any Irish pub.  Fish and chips were crisp and steaming! Would definitely order again. The coleslaw was also great (this coming from a girl who normally doesn't like slaw). Would definitely pop in again, if we're ever in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We visited Flannery's twice over the weekend and had a great time.  It is close to the ballpark, has a great selection of beers and great service.  Friday and Saturday evening that had fantastic live music that drew a good crowd of people.  great pub!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is a lot here. The food is high quality pub fare. Locals having fun after five is normal and the Cavaliers  and Indians play next door so expect a crowd on game nights.   Servers are friendly and quick and the beer is cold.   Don't stay downtown without giving this Pub a try!"}
{"text":"We stopped into Flannery's to feed our belly's before our gambling habit at the Horseshoe. This was my first time here. We've tried in the past before games but didn't want to wait for a seat. I had the french dip, and it was good. The bread, you can tell was fresh and it was great. My only beef about the sandwhich is that it was all bread and very little meat. I like my french dips thick and soaked in au jus!   The place is cool inside and if you score a window seat it makes for some really good people watching. We will go back again but not for the french dip."}
{"text":"Authentic Irish cuisine with a great environment. Decor was excellent as well as CLE sports on every wall! Shepherds pie was excellent and worth a try if you're down on 4th. Draft selections were awesome! 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"Needed a place to grab a bite to eat and a beer.  The hotel recommened this place and I was nut disappointed. The bar staff was attentive, friendly and personable.  The fish tacos were delicious and the beer selection was excellent. Next time I'm in Cleveland I know where I'm going-Flannery's."}
{"text":"Service was timely during game day. The cheese fondue app was awful. The pretzel was extremely dry and cheese dip was bland. The burger and prime rib sandwich was very yummy though."}
{"text":"Went here before a Browns game this past season. Good atmosphere, decent prices, and not too crowded (enough to have some good Browns pre-game spirit, but certainly not shoulder to shoulder crowds)."}
{"text":"Stopped by right before an Indians' game for a quick bite to eat and a 'snakebite' that hit just the right spot.   My parents were also along for the meal and we found all dishes met our palate.   My favorite thing though is they really know how to make a 'snakebite'!  Perfect blend of beer and hard cider.  Brings me back to my days of traveling through Germany and the is favorite Irish watering hole in Stuttgart."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about a half dozen times, probably because I really want to like it, for whatever reason. They just aren't giving me any good reason to.  It's in a pretty solid location. On the southern end of the East 4th Street strip, but also right across from the Q and the Jake. There is plenty of space inside, pretty decently sized bar, and in the summer, a nice outdoor patio (more on that soon).  Most people don't know that Flannery's is now owned by a small corporation (Trifecta Management Group) which also owns two other restaurant/bars on East 4th (Corner Alley and Zocalo). Once you know this, it's easy to understand why the atmosphere in Flannery's feels so much like a run-of-the-mill corporate chain.  The prices aren't cheap but aren't expensive; they're on-par for what you'd expect from East 4th, but not for the quality that you get. The Happy Hour is a dollar off drafts, which seems like a good deal until you realize they're merely taking $1 off a regularly priced $6 pint (sorry, imperial pint) of Guinness. The food is ok but nothing spectacular in my book.  The service is hit-or-miss. They are not fond of people who just want to sit out on the patio and relax with friends and drink. I got pretty rude service from a outside server who wasn't happy that my friend and I weren't planning to order full meals."}
{"text":"Great location next to the arenas. Great selection of beers. Had the Rubano {Ruben/Cuban} sandwich. It was delicious. Provides seating for parties of 1 or more. Has a cigarette dispenser, $10 a pack. Random kids came in trying to sell candy for fundraising, it seemed a bit awkward allowing kids in a pub or even soliciting. Otherwise, good for food and beer."}
{"text":"Long time patron(97?).....now I visit once a year from out of town. This place keeps getting better.  Service always, always hustles even during game time crunch. Food is a couple levels above typical Irish bar food.  Still best pregame spot or even better on an off day. Go here!"}
{"text":"Went there to grab lunch in between movies at the CIFF, because most all the good restaurants were closed on East 4th for lunch on Saturdays.    Ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an app   to share (waiters rec.), Fish and Chips, and a Guinness.    Sister ordered the Grilled Cheese and fries, and girlfriend the Chicken Tortilla soup and Cobb Salad.   All the food sucked.  Hard.  Appetizer was not very good. Greasy and fell apart as soon as you cut into it. The fish and chips were so greasy I've been sick since eating just a small portion of it. Don't think their grease was right temp as everything looked dark and wet. (You know you got problems when the fish and chips at an Irish joint is bad.)   The soup was not soup, but a super thick chowder that looked like a firm meatloaf, and was totally tasteless. Toasted cheese with peppers was horrible. Salad was nothing special but easily the most edible food on the table.   Waiter didn't seem even slightly concerned that nobody ate their meals as he cleared the table, but kindly offered us dessert.  Ugh.  The Guinness however.... was perfect.    Lesson learned?  This is a drinking establishment. Get your food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a few drinks. We sat in the main bar area at a table. We could only stay for one due to the stench. I don't know where it was coming from. I refused to use the bathroom there in fear of the condition it might be in.  Poor sanitation perhaps. I'm not sensitive to scents at all - it was bad. It even bothered my husband who has a bad sense of smell."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Colcannon soup was bitter and gross. Waitress not especially friendly. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"We were hungry after losing our money at the nearby casino, and none of the places on my list to try were open for weekday lunch, plus it'd started raining so we ducked in here.   I think the location is excellent.  The space is also great.  Nice beer and boozy drink selection.  I just wish the food was better.  I will recommend the Boyne Valley rolls appetizer.  The 4th Street Burger was OK.  The Fried Cheddar appetizer was OK."}
{"text":"pretty nice little Irish-style pub. we rolled over here around midnight after leaving 4th Street Bar and were able to secure outdoor seating.  prices are not fantastic, but not expensive either - for 8 of us to have 2 rounds of drinks, plus some shots in there, came to about $160.  they have Strongbow on tap, but I was eager to try some brews from Great Lakes Brewing Company, and as such, enjoyed a glass of Lake Erie Monster...and a gin and tonic...and half of my cousin's Sam Adams...and a shot of Captain.  fuck you, I do NOT have a drinking problem.  also, I went up to some cute girl who liked my Brooklyn accent and kissed her, saying \"THIS IS FROM FUCKIN' BROOKLYN TOO\". Cleveland, and that girl, will never be the same."}
{"text":"Yeah, really a 3.5.  Pluses include having imperial pints (20 oz instead of those wimpy 16 oz), huge seating areas, outside seating and a cool area.  Minuses include the crappy duo singing there playing most definitely non-Irish music (Johnny Cash ring of fire?) and the relatively high price of drinks (I understand it's downtown, maybe I just don't go out enough to know the average drink price down there).   So yeah, alright bar, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Server was great out side on patio on Saturday evening o way to Lake Erie hockey game Had Bangers & mash potato with peas and corn The bangers were great peas& corn were cool My friend had Rachael sandwich he said was great"}
{"text":"Yesterday and friend and I had the absolute best time at Flannery's! The bartenders, Stacey, Jackie and Kim were absolutely hysterical and showed us the best time ever in a downtown Cleveland pub. I recommend the rueben sliders as well. Kim also saw that I had a new tattoo on my ankle, went and got some disinfectant and wrapped it in gauze...I had simply asked for a bandaid and she went the extra mile for me!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome time watching the game even though the Cavs lost. Jen, our server was AWESOME!! Kept our glasses full and handled the crowd with ease! Cavs, not so great, but Flannery's made our night!"}
{"text":"Flannery's is a great place to come before or after a Cavs/Indians game, although it usually gets pretty packed. They have excellent beers on draft. Two of my favorite things to eat are the Crab, Spinach and Artichoke dip and the Chopped Chicken Salad. Though I've never tried it, the other people I have been with said that the Irish Fare (Fish & Chips and Sheperd's Pie) were very good."}
{"text":"Had burgers here which were good despite the bacon tasting kind of old. Side of fries were kind of stingy though. The service was good."}
{"text":"We headed west and found our way to 4th street. This was more of a pedestrian street with several restaurants to choose from. We walked to the end of the thoroughfare and decided on an Irish Pub called Flannery's.  At Flannery's, we were seated outside on the patio because it was a pleasantly breezy 70 degrees out. We were also within view of the Quicken Loans Arena where Labron James kills it on a daily basis during basketball season, but back to the meal. I went with the meat loaf, which was actually an impulse order. It was also fantastic. The loaf looked like it was baked, then sliced and sautéed with a nice little crunch on the outside. Did I mention that it was wrapped in bacon? The gravy on the loaf had a good amount of spice to it and the mashed potatoes were standard. I ordered a Burning River Pale Ale with the meal. Since it was a Cleveland brewing company, I decided to give this local brew a try. It was an OK ale. The bitter aftertaste was not very subtle and was ultimately the downfall to what could have been a good beer."}
{"text":"So, I felt as if I needed to come back to Flannery's since the last time I went was a semi-disaster.   Oh, the disaster part wasn't Flannery's fault... We went here to watch \"The Decision\" and how were they supposed to know how that was going to end?   Anyways, I met some really cool people out here to grab a few happy hour brews and grab some pub grub. I walked in and saw Strongbow on tap. Glorious. A cool fall evening, scarves, a warm bar and cider beer. It doesn't get much better than that.   Now, like I said, I was at this bar for that horrible day in Cleveland history when our hearts were all collectively broken. It was crazy packed and the service reflected the atmosphere. This time around I sat at the bar and was doted on like I was in a fancy restaurant. The server/bartender was so sweet and suggested a deliciously light meal for me: A cup of Irish Stew and a side salad. Nothing super special about the greens, but the stew was really tasty! Thick, savory, rich and soul-warming.   Really, Flannery's is just a great Irish pub downtown with a chill vibe and good food. That's what I love about it. And if you're looking for a good sports-watching bar or somewhere to tailgate, this is your spot. It's literally right by both Progressive Field and the \"Q\".    I'm coming back again and again... and I think I'll probably be trying some of their mac and cheese next time around."}
{"text":"Went here recently for more affordable dinner as some of my favorite places downtown are the pricey ones. Was pleasantly surprised by my experience. This review really would be a 3.5.  Got the veggie burger. Veggie burgers at restaurants are either tough patties or something that falls apart. Flavor is often an issue too.  Flannery's has a rice veggie burger, which does fall apart, but is actually flavored well and nice mix of ingredients (yay beets!). My tator tots were a little cold, but they fixed this quickly.  I just didn't expect to be as filling and good as it was. Not five star dining, but good food for the price at a location close to the Q."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby at the Holiday Inn Express. After coming to the hotel around 12:30am, I was starving for some food but the hotel didn't have any room service options that late at night. I looked on Yelp and low on behold: found out that this place does deliveries! I ordered a BBQ burger and some crab dip and a half hour later, a man knocked on my hotel door with a brown bag full of the goods. There was a few dollars (maybe as much as 5) delivery charge added on, but I was willing to pay for the convenience of not leaving my room that late in the night.  The pub fare was fantastic. The burger was cooked medium to order and the crab artichoke dip was creamy and tasty. I didn't even finish all of this, it was obviously too much. Nonetheless, I'm grateful that a pub delivered nearby and had their kitchen open late! Otherwise, I would have been one hungry, sad disappointed panda."}
{"text":"Excellent Onion Rings and Stuffed Mushrooms!  The fish and chips were good per my wife, but like others said-too much batter.   Portion size good, could almost share an appetizer and main course.   Good prices, pretty good Irish food."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of my new favorite spots.  It's a good mix of people, relaxing atmosphere, and a great place to watch sports games.  Though I'm normally there pre/post sports games, it's always been a wonderful time (and good food).    Staff is great, serve strong drinks, and remember faces/people.  It's a bar that makes you feel welcome and part of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love Flannery's.  One of the places that I actually miss in Cleveland.  Whether you come here before a game, after work or just for a random drink, it is always a good time.   The food is good... your basic Irish pub grub and for me, it has always been consistent.  Is it as good as my fave pub back in Pgh, no, but it is still pretty awesome.  The beer and liquor selection is pretty good.    Service can be hit or miss, which was why I always preferred the bar to sit at, and service there was always good!    If you are in the area and looking for a low key and reasonably priced time, check out Flannery's."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for lunch more than dinner. This is a quick stop for lunch during work and the food is great. The dinner menu and beer prices seem pricey for the competition around i.e. harry buffalo, corner alley. Overall, this place has great food, consistant service, and there is hardly ever a wait."}
{"text":"Food was just meh. Had the French Dip, a whole lot of bread here and not a lot of jus. Also service was way slow and they weren't even that busy. Talk about under staffed."}
{"text":"I find it rare in American to find a truly authentic Irish restaurant. A truly authentic Irish restaurant must have an Irish atmosphere, traditional Irish menu and pour a perfect pint of Guinness plus have other Irish beers. This had all of this but the menu was slightly limited hence the four stars and not five. I highly recommend this pub to anyone looking for the above mentioned. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs! We had a large group 30+ in the back room with an appetizer buffet. Staff and manager even judge contests for us."}
{"text":"This place is hopping before a Cavs Game.   They have  a limited menu on a cavs game night.  But come on down.  It's the place to be.    The only food we had was the spinach artichoke dip. Lots of spinach, lots of artichoke.  I didn't notice any cheese so don't get it if youre expecting cheese."}
{"text":"If you're just looking for a bar to chill and hang out with your friends, this is a great place. If you're looking for decent service and delicious food, try again.   This place is slightly overpriced for their food and the food is mediocre. Maybe a little tastier than most bars in Cleveland, but this is a bar located on East 4th so I kind of had high expectations. If you are a bar on East 4th, you should make sure to have great service and great food, and Flannery's had neither.   I ordered their shrimp appetizer and my friends had some fish & chips. Honestly, I liked their food, it just wasn't as delicious as a lot of other bars I've been trying in Cleveland.   Come for a fun night of drinks, but probably not for gourmet food."}
{"text":"Tasty burger. Decor leaves a lot to be desired.  No TP in ladies room even though not busy and was attacked through entire meal by flies. Gross. Server was excellent. Food overall decent."}
{"text":"The ale (Old Speckled Hen, Newcastle) was good once it warmed.  It was brought to the table too cold.  My Irish stew was good, but it could have 'stewed' longer.  The flavors didn't seem blended enough for a stew, but the lamb was good.  Classic rock was playing (not live).  The pool table and lounge in the back looked inviting.  We sat in a booth along the Window which gave us a view of the Cavaliers Arena."}
{"text":"Went here around  8 on a Saturday night and had our pick of tables.  Our waiter, I think his name was Tim, was pretty hilarious. He took care of us even when the crowd started rolling in.  I will say I had 3 vodka sodas and didn't even have a buzz so to me that signals a problem. Considering I don't drink very often anything but wine, I can guess it was a pretty weak pour.  The BF had an irish coffee and some cider/guiness mixture I wouldn't dare try.  He really like it there.   I'd go back, it was a nice \"douche-free\" spot which is so rare Downtown. Oh and they had darts and a skee ball  machine that I noticed too late.  They were occupied, but damn I know I had a bulls eye in me, too bad."}
{"text":"We hit Flannery's up on a random Sunday for lunch, the beer was tasty the game was on and the place had a great relaxed vibe. I enjoyed my sandwich and our server was freindly. A solid spot!"}
{"text":"Feels a little strange to only give Flannerys a three star rating as it's a regular in our dining and take out rotation. However, when I ask myself: would I come here as regularly if it wasn't across the street and one of the most reasonably priced options downtown? The answer is no.  The reasons we do frequent Flannery's (aside from proximity and price) are the beer menu that's a little different from other places in town with reasonable pricing, the pub nachos, and entrees/sandwiches large enough to share (I fool myself into thinking that appetizer+half entree/sandwich is less caloric than full entree/sandwich alone. I don't think this math ever truly works out but I'll continue to live in my own utopian food world.)  The pub nachos are just...right. Perfectly executed nachos, probably my favorite nachos in town. The chips are the perfect level of crisp, they use this taco sauce (? Not sure if it's actually taco sauce but the flavors are all there) that gets down to the very bottom of the chips and pairs perfectly with the cheese. Fresh salsa with a little kick of spice and black beans make adding meat unnecessary. Sometimes there are chopped green onion and black olives, sometimes there aren't. The guacamole and sour cream come on the side, which is a great decision to keep the chips from getting soggy and also leaves some lovin for the inevitably neglected chips at the bottom of the pile. Definitely get the nachos.  I decided that good nachos should not a 4 star rating make though. The rest of the menu is good pub food, I've never had anything bad just nothing to write home about. I usually opt for the Reuben because the corned beef is always tender and the sauerkraut to meat ratio is good. There is something about the bread that could be improved upon that I can't put my finger on though. The fries are just ok for me, but only because I prefer a thinner fry over a steak fry. I also think they are a frozen fry, which honestly is ok by me but I mention it for fry purists. Our other go to is the pub style fibs and chips. The Guinness batter is so tasty that I'm able to forgive the fact that it's 2/3 batter and 1/3 fish. I like to use malt vinegar on the entire plate with some tartar sauce here and there (tartar sauce is just so so)."}
{"text":"Came in on an early Tuesday afternoon at around 5pm . I must say I did like that EVERY server was attentive to my needs but it was not the atmosphere I expected. The food was ok and I must say they where probably over staffed because of the impending Cavs game. Leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Irish Pub. Great for dinner with a group, (we had 6 people total), and they were able to seat us on a busy night right away (unlike a LOT of other 4th street options). Standard bar-Irish menu, but everything tasted great. Our server was quick and efficient. The Irish Soda Bread Pudding was also a nice surprise. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"great selection of food and beers. Service was ok and the meals were served in a reasonable amount of time. we would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a really nice old school Irish pub. We went midday around 3 and it was pretty dead. No table service available so we ate at the bar which was fine. I had a Reuben, pretty good, no complaints here. The chicken sandwich was OK but nothing special and a little skimpy on the portion size. We both loved the fries which were potato disks, very crispy and salty the way I like them. Overall a decent place to come to before a game or for a quick bite and some Irish whiskey."}
{"text":"Always a good goto restaurant before a sporting event downtown! It was packed but the hostess was super nice and made waiting not so bad! Food came fast once we were seated! I got the Reuben sliders and they were a perfect size as I wasn't all that hungry. My friend got the burger and she said it was good too! Waitresses were right on top of everything!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our regular hang-outs...but after this weekend I will always encourage visitors to go elsewhere. We came here post wedding reception as there were QUITE a few of us. Staff was not equipped for the size of the group, GM actually yelled at the bride and one servers was on an ego-trip of the century after a guest apologized twice for being inappropriate. If there weren't so many of us I would have relocated the entire party... How sad, I'm bummed - this place was awesome. And I get it...I've been in the industry, I've dealt with drunk bumholes - but there was NO REASON for their crappiness. It could have been handled a heck of a lot differently."}
{"text":"It's a pub with an Irish name. So you'd bet that the food is mediocre, and it is.  Why is it you never see an Irish restaurant that is not a pub? Because you have to be drunk to think the food is good.  I had the fish and chips. It wasn't horrible but it's nothing memorable.  The biggest plus of this place is its location. It's very close to the sports venues, so drunk people from the games can walk here and get more drunk. Every restaurant has to have its core constituency."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the service was poor at best. We were a group of 16; this proved too much for our server to handle. No other member of the staff was helping her, even tough the restaurant was not busy and staff was available. We spent most of the time waiting for our food. Dishes arrived cold; some of us asked for re-heating. Our server was MIA most of time. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It was late, and there was much drinking.  After catching a show at HOB, I hobbled/stumbled down the street to lounge on the patio with a beer (with the band).    Everything was perfectly nice and servicable, from what I remember, but nothing stands out as exactly memorable...um, not that the many beers have ANYTHING to do with it.  Uh, huh."}
{"text":"Dude....sweet! This place is excellent. Great food, beer selection, service, location, the type of place you could belly up to the bar at after work or bring a large party for a celebration. Burgers and onion rings were delicious. Good prices and the perfect place to stop on in before a game. Will definitely be back next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped in between a visit to the Rock n Roll HOF and a movie.  Good food & atmosphere for myself and three college students (my son and friends).  The \"kids\" played pool while waiting for our food and had a generally good time.  One miscue...the appetizers and meals arrived more or less together."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  The hostess sat us at a table outside right away. The service was excellent and quick. Our food came out hot, it was delicious.  Fair prices. Good place to grab a quick dinner and a couple drinks before going to a show at HOB or Pickwick & Frolic.  We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Quick seating at a table with live Irish music (let alone GOOD music). Waiter was being a bit of a creeper (didn't say yes or ok when we ordered something, just kind of quietly nodded).   We just stopped in for pints and dessert, the chocolate chip cookies were a bit flat and disappointing, but the bread pudding was amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! It is my favorite pre and post tribe game stop!! I forget in the winter how much I adore it!!  We stopped in the other night for a drink and an appetizer and it made me wish it was summer!!!  Over all of my experiences here, I can say the food is good! Nothing excellent but I do love the little GF signifying gluten free!!! I love their nachos! Great selections of beers. Although I cannot drink it, try smithwicks beer.. All true Irish men drink it in Ireland and everyone raves about it.  The loss of one star is because on a busy night, their service is awful. They need either more bartenders or more experience behind the bar. But overall, this place is great and makes me miss Ireland!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a drink before the Lady Gaga concert and the place was packed.   It's very much an Irish Pub and the food we saw looked great.   We did have a cup of the soup special of the day which was potato with bacon and cheese.   The soup was good.   My husband asked for a Moscow Mule,  but they were out of ginger beer.   I will never understand a restaurant not having something that is a staple for their business available."}
{"text":"Always busy but worth it!!!   Next time we will sit on the Patio!  We took a trip to Cleveland for the Indians game and wanted to grab a meal after.   With unlimited choices, we looked for a great burger.     We immediately jumped into the only two seats at the bar and were greeted by two of the most stressed out and busy bartenders around.   Without hesitation, our drinks were ordered and delivered moments later.     The menu was typical yet screamed Irish and burgers.    Now keep in mind this is an Irish themed pub, so expect what you will and we did not have the highest expectations.   The decor was solid and the atmosphere was \"pubby\" and dim.   Plenty of TVs for sports.   Restrooms were in the perfect spot.   The crowd was loud and happy.   Drink pours were right on.   The general cleanliness was not exceptional but definitely sufficient for the high traffic and fact it was a Saturday night after a ball game.     We ordered typical meals for the situation.  Burger and fries, Reuben and a salad.   Since the place was packed, we assumed service would lag and quality would be right out the window.   Our food arrived hot and well plated, portions were great, taste was even better.   To our surprise, the bartender apologized for our food not being faster.    It was only 20 min from order to first bite.    Overall, give this place your business.   The staff all seemed to work hard but obviously were slammed and stressed.   The service was excellent, food was excellent, and atmosphere was exactly what you would want and expect from an Irish Pub in Downtown 216!!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for an Indians-Twins night game and made a pit stop at Flannery's Pub. Flannery's is one of maybe a dozen or so pubs that have sprouted up around the Indians' Progressive Field...since the ballpark only opens its doors one hour before game time during the week and there is no place to tailgate...pre-game activities goes to these pubs...and Flannery's was a good one.  Very nice beer selection...lots on draft and many more in bottles. I went nice and easy and just had a Harp lager. We shared pub nachos (these were very good...piled high and deep and covered with black beans, pico de gallo, and two kinds of cheese...and all warmed up...this was a nice filling dish) and fried mozzarella sticks (turned out to be the winner...they take a roll of fresh mozzarella and slice it into disks like wheels...lightly covered with panko breading and lightly fried...sitting on a marinara sauce...with shreds of basil...these were the best mozzarella sticks I've ever had).  You can sit in or out at this pub...which is very large and can seat loads of peeps. Service was just right. This is a good stop on the way in or out of Progressive Field, or anytime you are in downtown Cleveland near the athletic centers. This location is also just two blocks from the Quicken Loan Arena where the Cleveland Cavaliers play. Next time you are in the area hit up this pub."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch on Saturday and it was probably one of the best burgers i've had for a really long time. Cooked to perfection - topped with one amazingly delicious onion ring, cheese and bbq sauce. The key was it was still easy to eat with my hands! My buddies were pleased as well - they both had burgers and were simply too happy eating to provide additional comments except for \"mmmmmmmm\" and happy smiles."}
{"text":"Place is in steady decline.  Menus are tattered.  Same beers they have had since the 90s and employees are ghetto, except for bartenders.  I just bought 1 beer, handed her a 10 and was asked if I wanted change.  Does she tip 4.00 on one draft beer?  Bet not.  Place sucks..."}
{"text":"food was ok, but service was great! was really crowded because of the game, but our server came by frequently and was very pleasant"}
{"text":"Good for the quick and easy. Only place open past 10 to catch a bite M-T. Food isn't good though. Go somewhere else to eat if it's open."}
{"text":"What you would expect close to a ball park. Good bar. We enjoyed the beer cheese fondue as a group. The rest of the food was average."}
{"text":"The best Irish food I've ever had. Great food and great beer choices. I highly recommend the stuffed mushrooms and the bacon wrapped meatloaf. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"all i know...is i had a terrible bread pudding here -- cold -- yuk"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland over the weekend for the marathon.  The day before the race, I wanted to get an early dinner and have one quality beer.  I could not have made a better choice than Flannery's.  Unfortunately, on my walk over to Flannery's I got caught in the rain, and by the time I walked in I looked like a drowned rat.  Nevertheless, the hostess was friendly and seated me right away.  My waiter, Timmy, was also very friendly and seemed to sense that I was uncomfortable about my soaked appearance.  After asking what kind of beer I like, he suggested a Murphys Amber, which was right on the money.  I ordered fish and chips, which for some reason always appeals to me when traveling out of town to a race.  The fish was nice and hot, the fries were quite good, and the meal was served with cole slaw.  Timmy was pushing dessert, but I was too full to even consider it.  I told him I would come back on Sunday and have the chocolate chip cookies with milk.    However, I did not realize at the time that Flannery's does not open until 3 pm on Sundays -- and I wound up \"settling\" for Mexican food after my race, which was not nearly as good of an experience.  In retrospect, I should have waited."}
{"text":"A no-brainer. It's an Irish Pub for sure and both the vibe and the food are perfect complements to the stiff drinks and nice vibe."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Have been in Cleveland for a week and all the foo foo places have decent food but horrific service. Our waitress at Flannery's was a 12 on a 1-10. Autumn, you are the best. Great food. Great pour on the Guinness. A go to place."}
{"text":"My husband visited Cleveland for the first time last weekend.  Stumbled upon Flannery's for lunch on Saturday and fell in love.  Great stuff on tap and a nice selection of whiskey.  Wait staff was  friendly and the food was good.  We visited again that night for drinks and pool (no waiting) and the place was hoping- festive and lively but didn't feel claustrophobic.  We visited for lunch before we left for the airport on Monday.   I ordered the Mac n cheese and Caesar combo.  The menu boasted a good portion of the Mac n Cheese but this wasn't the case.  I was a little hungry after I scarfed everything on my plate.  Shouldn't happen with pub food, in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Flannery's has a chillout room. Whoda thunk? Well, there are some sofas in the back and there's a TV and a pool table, and it's all out of the way of the bustle up front. I'm now a fan because when it comes to sassy waitresses delivering corned beef eggrolls, I'm a pushover."}
{"text":"This looked like a cool place on a slow Friday evening after visiting the R&R HOF.  The server was o.k. and the food was o.k.  I like Irish food and for that it's definitely heavy & stick to the ribs.  The Spinach/Artichoke dip was o.k., the Chicken Cottage Pie was tasty, but looked like a big bowl of cream-colored sloppiness and the Grilled Meatloaf was interesting.  It was thin slices of what seemed to be deep-fried mush, but it tasted mostly of maple-flavored bacon, it was pretty sweet.  A step up from the typical bar food menu, but next time I'd order sandwiches or salads.  I woke up the next morning still full from this meal...erp.  They have Strongbow on tap though...Yay!"}
{"text":"An excellent Irish pub without a lot of frills, but with a whole lot of heart. The staff are attentive, the beer is relatively cheap, and the food is authentic. There is a nice room in back to play pool, which I appreciate. What happened to good old pool halls being ubiquitous in Cleveland? Truthfully, Flanney's is a throwback in many ways beyond the pool table. Take out a TV or two and this could be a Dublin pub circa 1925. A quality downtown bar for those look for something a little less high brow than the major contenders at the heart of E. 4th."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch Wednesday. The place was clean and the staff was great. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries off the lunch menu and my friend got the mac n cheese. My chicken fingers and fries were amazing! I would actually go here just to eat their fries. They basically cut a potato into slices and deep fry them. I think they make them per order as well. They're so good. My friends noodles were cooked perfect. And he said the sauce was great and tasted homemade and not a yellow packet. The food came out really quick. We get an hour lunch and we had to walk here and walk back. We actually had 15 minutes to spare so we just sat and talked. The booths aren't very fluffy people friendly so best to get a table. There weren't many options for the lunch menu. Their menu is available online so check them out before you go. They are a bit pricey but worth it! Can't wait to go back and get those fries again!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special but they know how to pour a Guinness. More importantly, your thirst will typically be slaked quickly even on a busy night. Decent beer selection aside from Irish standards. Not a bad option for before or after events in the area."}
{"text":"The food was great, lots of flavor in everything. The Shepard's Pie was one of the best I have had. The service was great. We sat at the bar before a Brown's game and it was very busy, but the staff took great care of us."}
{"text":"Any place that has hard cider, TVs and one of the best bowls of mac and cheese I've ever had (smoked gouda, ooooh) gets a thumbs up from me.  The only thing that could make it better would be if a hot guy shows up and offers to pay for my and my friend's bill.  Thanks Bob Johnson!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a mid-afternoon snack on a Sunday afternoon as there was little else open in the area. The fish tacos were delicious as was the wedge salad. They also have a great tap beer selection and we quite enjoyed the patio outside. At least until it started raining."}
{"text":"The last time I was at Flannery's Pub was last year for St Patty's Day and it was crazy busy and fun. The bar it pretty huge which is good, they usually have live bands playing too, which I love. The inside of the bar is definitely that of an Irish Pub, which means it's an excellent to just chill and have a Guiness. E 4th street is a really cool/cute area by itself so you really can't lose when you choose to come over to Flannery's or the other places on that street. If you're looking to just hang out with friends, drink some beers and listen to some Irish music, Flannery's is the place for you."}
{"text":"I've been to Flannery's a few times now and I've finally decided I really like the place.   At first, it doesn't seem like too much - you're typical Irish bar, which it is.  However, there are a few things to note which puts it a step above they have a decent beer list and often they will have live music on the weekends.    Most IMPORTANTLY, they have really good food. I stopped in for lunch and ordered the small lamb stew and a small house salad.  The salad had fresh, quality ingredients and the stew was delicious, filling, a hearty size for a small, and topped with a delicious puff pastry. My friend ordered the bangers and mash and said it was also really good. If you are downtown and looking for a lunch place - go here! Good food and it isn't crowded, it's a great week day lunch option."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and good atmosphere. We sat on the patio and had a waitress. The service is slow so order a beer when you are about half way through. In a fantastic location."}
{"text":"Always had great times here! They have live entertainment inside and you can also sit outside and just people watch in the summer when the weather is nice! I've been going to Flannery's since there was nothing around there and still make sure I go there to chill when we're downtown! I love the irish feel to it and their beer selection. I only ordered food a few times but it was good! And service is friendly, maybe a little slow but considering they are always super busy maybe I'm asking too much! Lol"}
{"text":"A friendly face was abound. Delicious Shepherd's pie and fried mozzarella.  Everything else was closed because if was after lunch and before dinner.  I was happy that I went inside. Everyone was smiling and you instantly felt welcomed and knew you were part of their place and they wanted you to eat and be merry.  The food was delicious and would recommend this place highly.  I only wish we had spent more time here instead of spending a fortune on all the high price places around."}
{"text":"I wasn't super wild about this bar (it's not on my list of places to go back to when in town), but I had to give it an extra star for the superb job the bartender did handling all of the drunken idiots when we dropped in. Man, oh, man, I don't know how he kept his cool, retain authority, and managed to be super nice and personable, but props to him for real.  My boyfriend and I probably walked in around 1-ish? It was our last night in Cleveland, but we weren't quite ready for things to be over. This was the only place still open in the area.  First things we noticed when we walked in: food and drinks spilled everywhere, knocked over chairs, loud and obnoxious guests. Your typical end of night weekend crowd that you'll find in any city. The bartenders definitely had their hands full and a few of the patrons were completely out of control. In any case, we only had a few beers before we hitched a ride in a cab back to the hotel. You stay classy, Flannery's."}
{"text":"The short: Pan-fried mozzarella was a great blending of the cheese flavor and the marinara-like sauce it came on top of. Shepherd's pie was an amazing mix of cheese, gravy, and mashed potatoes.   The long: Went to Flannery's on the night of a 7:30pm Cavaliers game at about 5:30pm without a problem getting seats. We sat in the back of the restaurant, kind of like the \"special events\" room, so it was a bit more quiet.   Ordered three appetizers: pan-fried mozzarella, Boyne Valley rolls, and Guinness mushrooms(fried)  Pan-fried mozzarella was a delicious. There was a slight amount of friend edges on the slices of mozzarella, and 5 slices were served on top of a \"bed\" of their \"marina\" sauce. The sauce and mozzarella combined to make some interesting flavors, almost like a nice wine+cheese paring.  Boyne Valley rolls came with a slightly thicker crust than your typical Chinese take-out eggrolls. They were cut in half diagonally. The corned beef was the predominant flavor and texture(outside of the fried skin of the rolls)  Guinness mushrooms tasted like standard deep fried cream cheese stuffed mushrooms. It didn't seem like the Guinness flavor really was present at all in our batch.   Ordered the Shepherd's Pie entree, which was a fantastic blend of gravy and mashed potatoes topped with a thick layer of melted cheese. It all came together to make a rich-in-flavor and slightly-soupy/creamy-in-consistency interior topped with gooey cheese. Although the dish is about 1-1.5inches deep and 6-7inches in diameter, the dish is a rich one(I suppose as Shepherd's pie should be!)   Overall - a place that I would mention to friends who are visiting, but not necessarily somewhere I would need to bring out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Meatloaf. I had some sort of bacon & Gouda laced, chipotle & apple ketchup sauced meatloaf from heaven. Dear God baby Jesus. Yum. Veggies on the side were crisp and mash potatoes were good as well. Good selection of drinks and apps, too."}
{"text":"When I arrived in Cleveland last week, I was absolutely FAMISHED.  I stumbled on over to 4th street and saw Flannery's.  I love me some Irish pubs so it was an obvious choice.  Definitely glad to have stopped in!  I had the Garlic Chicken Melt Sandwich, which was basically a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with fries - really good and killed my hunger!  I would like to come back here at night to check it out as a bar, as well!"}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland out on a whim. Why? I still don't know. Cute city though. Stayed in the business district where everything was closed on the weekends except for bars and restaurants. What did I do? Went to the street with the most lights lit. Flannery's Pub was just right on the corner with loud Irish music that lured me in considering it was St. Patty's weekend. Good live music. Superb customer service in my experience coming from a Chicagoan who has to put up with stuck up/snobby food service all the time. Megan was our waitress and she was beyond accommodating. Fast and efficient service. Food wise? I've had better =(  I ordered the rib eye cheesesteak. It might have been the driest and most flavorless cheesesteak that I've ever had in my life. I suggest that they double the cheese and flavor the beef a bit more. That should help. The onion ring appetizer was satisfying. Crispy and HUGE portion, so be warned. I swear that those onion rings were the size of my big bracelet. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef and it was borderline awful.   Despite the food, we had a good time. Good atmosphere. Our bill didn't break the wallet. Good drinks. Good service."}
{"text":"went up to Cleveland for the night - so glad we choose this place to eat at. Ended up that after few hours of restaurant and bar hopping - we came back to watch the band here and had a blast. Fish n Chips was awesome and great beer selection. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Downtown Cleveland, Irish Pub that was hoping for St Patty's Day.  Its at the top of bar alley that has a fun decor and I nice food menu!"}
{"text":"The recent menu changes have left several of us who frequent Flannery's disappointed - the food is OK and even worthy of 3 stars, but the special items we came for are no longer offered.  The best (Bay seasoning) wings you can find downtown, mini Reuben's, French Dip, fat French fries - all off the new menu.  Not that the new options aren't good - but you can get them at other places in the neighborhood - we came for the great atmosphere, generally efficient service and the very good food we enjoyed in the past.   Appreciate changes to menus, as it is necessary to keep your clientele coming back - but why take away the well-loved items?   From what we heard (and overheard at the bar), our disappointment is shared with other regulars...so maybe the Chef and/or management will consider our thoughts.  And the new menu is very difficult to read - small font and light colored ink (saw someone actually use his flashlight to read his menu). Thanks for listening, Flannery's -"}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge Irish pub with quite the flare. Authentic beers on tab along with the normal crafts as well. Nice selection of liqueurs and a perfect atmosphere. It's a great place to go before or after concerts at the house of blues so you don't get ripped off. I've never tried the food but I'm sure it's not disappointing. Flannery's is definitely a place to stop and stay awhile when downtown."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before going to a hockey game and I did like the place! It's nice and big and has a lot going on \"visually\". It wasn't too crowded- it was a Wednesday night so I wasn't surprised. Just wanted to grab a drink before the game so we sat at the bar and ordered two captain and coke's. Bartender was friendly but the drinks were a tad weak. Wasn't expensive though. I'm used to paying 9-10 bucks for a drink in NY so paying 10 bucks for two together was pretty cool lol   Everything was pretty good overall. I did like the atmosphere  I'd go again! It would have been an overall good experience except there was a group of girls there who were obnoxiously loud! Ugh. Atleast seven of them just screaming at the top of their lungs. You gotta wonder about some people- I get that you're drunk and having a good time- but when the rest of the bar is quiet- there really is no need to be that loud. :::eye roll:: I must be getting old LoL! Well luckily, the hockey game was starting soon so we didn't stay very long after these girls started acting up. But yea- check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Bar Food - That is the best way to put it. We had a large group who decided to stop here prior to the Browns game. They had $3 miller lights which came in a nice miller plastic cup.   They had a limited food menu due to it being a Game day, which was understandable. I ordered a fondue dip, which ended up not being to great. This was because it was a huge bowl of cheese and minimal sides to dip in it because it was \"game day\".   If you were to stop here, I would stick to the alcohol and not waste your time on the food."}
{"text":"You know the places you frequent because of the people? This is one of those places. The bartenders are just amazing, and the atmosphere is exactly what you're looking for when you go into an Irish pub- there's always a lively, fun crowd, and cozy pub feel.  They've got a great patio too... Do yourself a favor and come early when they have live music, so you can get a good seat."}
{"text":"Well, we were disappointed and I've always liked this spot for a pre-game bite. We sat at bar and I think bartender forgot about us or went on long smoke break. Fish and chips were off the mark too. I think they let it sit too long, cold fries, greasy fish, too much batter. And the Irish fondue was not good. Unsalted \"pretzel\" roll (i.e. bread), raw broccoli and lukewarm cheese sauce. Hopefully this was an anomaly and not a harbinger of things to come."}
{"text":"I would give it 1 1/2 stars.  The food was average.  The place seemed slow with many vacant tables at 9pm on a Friday night, so it seemed a good time to eat when we might get attentive staff.  The reason for low score was the wait staff sucked, and gave attitude.  After spending time at the casino, I wanted to share a new eating experience with my friends.  The guy serving us did not ask how we are doing, if we had been there before, but went straight to asking us for drinks.  When our table ordered non-alcoholic drinks , the server seemed annoyed that we were not ordering beers.  After drinks delivered, the server took our orders but again seemed annoyed and disinterested when we asked questions.  The server had another staff come over and that guy rolled his eyes to his coworker.  No flatware or napkins, so we had to ask.  Food came.  After, he cleared table abruptly, interrupting our conversation.  Delivered the bill, but didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  When we were leaving the server was five feet away and did not acknowledge us.  The total experience left us feeling like crap.  I am used to leaving 30-40% tip for good service, but because it was so terrible, we left hardly anything.  I think because the server assumed our tipping status, he gave terrible service... funny thing is that he made his self-fulfilling prophecy come true based upon his own actions.  Did they treat us badly because our party of four consisted of two blacks, a hispanic, and white?  Or do they equally treat everyone badly that goes here?"}
{"text":"This place was great the bartenders and patrons were friendly. The food was great. I was in town for the wrestling tournament and this place was awesome on St. Paddy's day!!!!!! I went early for breakfast, the burritos were great hit the spot before the tournament. Downtown Cleveland is crazy good on St. Paddy's day, I wasn't I the thick of it, but it was awesome!!!!  A must visit if your in for a Game."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever eaten here. It was a slow time of the day but still had great atmosphere.  Our server was super friendly & very attentive.  We started with the Boyne Valley Rolls (a Ruben egg roll pretty much) and followed it with the pulled pork sandwich.  It's a Very tasty pork topped with fresh coleslaw and served with fresh fried potatoes. It was delicious! We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food here is flavorful and and somewhat elegant. I ordered the Shrimp and Crab Mac special. It was a symphony of flavours. The seafood was fresh, the pasta perfectly cooked, and the cream sauce was heaven. It was so decadent and creamy, made with Gouda, cream, Parmesan.   Friends ordered the fried mozzarella. They use fresh!  They have a large and unique beer list.   This pub is definitely 5 stars for great food, great atmosphere, great service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Cool spot.  We caught them at a time when they weren't busy but the Cavs were in town that evening so I think it was just a matter of timing. We were able to get right in and sit at the bar. Had Levar for our bartender. He makes a crazy good Bloody Mary.  I have to be the world's pickiest Bloody Mary drinker so if I say it was delish, it totally was!  We did not order food so can't review that but the menu looked cool.    The place was clean and service was quick."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this Irish Bar in the heart of downtown Cleveland but last night was great!  With friends and family in from out of town, we were debating on where to have dinner and since I was the only one from around here, my recommendation was what they were going with.  After much, talk we decided to keep the night low key seeing that we had been bar hopping thus far.  Flannery's was the perfect mix of laid back and fun times rolled into one.   Surprisingly, we only waited 5 minutes for a table for 6 on a Saturday.  Must of been perfect timing and our table was just far enough from the stage.  Lucky us, there was a duet of Irish singing brothers that started at 9:30.  We had just enough time to order our first round of drinks and appetizers before they began.  And wow, were they entertaining.  Singing all the well known Irish tunes, guitars strumming and people dancing at their tables, there was always something to chat about besides what we had to say.   The food was a little disappointing though on my end.  I ordered a spinach and artichoke flatbread which when described on the specials menu, sounded amazing.  But it came out cold, and had to be sent back.  My friend ordered wings which also had to be sent back and the only logical things that I could think of was that they made our meals first and let them sit under the heat lamps while the rest of our tables food was prepared.  Once brought back out though, it was tasty and the group seemed to enjoy everything that they had ordered as well. Bonus to Flannery's is definitely the Single Malt Scotch List!!  I could have drank scotch until the next day and suffered from one hell of a hangover!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab a drink, and some food. The food isn't going to change your life, but it is good. I really liked the corned beef. They forgot the chicken on my boyfriend's fettuccine, but quickly remedied the problem."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us looking for dinner. Go to Flannery's because the menu looked pretty good. We get inside and the hostess is a total knucklehead. We asked for a table of 5 and she couldn't make it work. Not only that she didn't care. We left and not going back."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting for a conference, and found this place.  We had nacho's and added Steak and Chicken. WOW what a way to start it off. The best nachos I have ever had at a pub.   Then followed it up with a steak sandwich.  One of the best sandwiches I have ever had.   But alas I was north of the Mason Dixon Line and when I asked for sweet tea was told \"there is sugar on the table\" ... was a great meal to end a LONG day.."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place for what it is intended to be... a pub. However, I don't associate this place with the Irish pub that it wants to be.   We stop in here every so often and I want to like it more and more but it's difficult to when the staff can't remember the correct order and it takes forever for food and drinks sometimes. The last time we were here, we ordered the Reuben Sliders which are $10 and we weren't hungry for a lot of food. However, the bartender ordered us two full size Reuben sandwiches with fries and all. Each of the Reuben sandwiches were $11. So instead of spending just $10 for food and some more for drinks, we ended up spending more than double!   Next time I come in, it will probably be just for drinks because I don't want to double pay again for something that I don't even want."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times on busy days such and never had any opinion of the place.  I headed up here St. Patty's Day this year very early since I had to work that evening.  The bar took a while to fill up so we kinda felt like we were in our own private bar of leprechauns.  We started off with some mimosas using the Strongbow Cider in place of champagne.  The day involved many more Irish beers and whiskeys and fun.  The next time I stopped here was mainly to sit on a patio downtown on a glorious Sunday afternoon.  We had a snakebite to drink (Strongbow+Harp) and I wanted to try all of their mixed cider/beer drinks.  They should have a flight of them, cause some could be really bad.  (Cider+Guiness?)  We ate lunch here which I have never done here before.  Started off with the stuffed mushrooms and I'm pretty sure they were the best I've ever had.  I couldn't have been happier.  I got a reuben sandwich for my meal which was so flavorful and the meat just fell apart in my mouth.  It was cut thicker, yet still lean.  So much flavor and msg.  So good.    I will probably come back and maybe try something new.  Probably not though.  What I chose was amazing."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the last night I was in town for a conference. Staff was super friendly and they have a pretty decent menu. I don't remember the name, but the burger I ordered had a fried egg and some other yummy toppings. That, some fries and a couple Dog Fish Head IPAs and I was a happy customer."}
{"text":"I don't yelp to bitch at resturants. In fact, the opposite. But when you have a tornado of mediocre service, insulting managerial service, and sub par bar food you deserve what you have coming for you. Close to our hotel, we figured fun sports bar why not? With a 1/4 filled bar you would set the expectation that drinks for 6 shouldn't take more then 10 minutes(being generous) but they did. Our group, no more rowdy then the next sports fan, was insulted by the manager making a quick tongued comment about our groups age and how we were too old to be act \"that way\". Now I'm all for a staff keeping an orderly bar, especially if/when people are being destructive, disruptive, and vulgar, but when it's just 6 woman in a bar that's mostly men we most certainly didn't act in that manner to deserve that managers comment. Now on top of the cold food, soggy nachos,over cooked apps, our experience was less than satisfactory with the promise I will never step foot in that bar again."}
{"text":"Great place to sit and have a drink and chill.  I came in here after a late night business meeting which involved way too many drinks and needed a reprieve from the streets of cleveland. (and some hair o dog)  Sat in the back by the servers station which privied me to some interesting conversation and an inside look at the staff personalities.   Ordered a Stella and a bowl of cheese potato soup. Normally this would have been good but all I could muster up was a couple bites of soup and the garlic bread it came with. Bartender asked me if it was ok, I assured him it was me, not the soup and tried to eat some more, to no avail.A little bit later had another bartender come and ask the same thing and gave the same reply. Then had a manager (Sean ake Beyonce) come over and ask the same thing in which he got the reply\" I have a hangover damnit leave me alone!\" LOl, he was a good sport about it even though he was having less than an ideal day.  Sat for two more Stellas, funny how I felt so much better and chatted with the staff, who is oh so friendly and fiesty. Even ended up meeting the owner and chatting with him about the social ecominic status of the area.  I could have hung out here all night but had to get ready for the big dinner at lola. This place is a great hangout. I can't imagine the food is all that, it's an Irish pub, the beers were could and the place is large and active with outside seating as well.  Wish they had one in Tampa!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great beer selection, great appetizers. It is clean and everyone is as pleasant as can be. We only stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer. However, when there was an appetizer mix up, the staff went above and beyond remedying the situation. Great crew. We enjoyed our stop in here."}
{"text":"We spent New Year's Eve there. A nice place overall, our waitress was very friendly and helping.  The plates are pretty big and not too expensive. I do recommend 3 variations of burgers: Flannery's, Prospect and Pub.  You can choose tater tots instead of regular fries. they are good!  the do have a couple of european beers (I appreciated the presence of Chimay!!)."}
{"text":"One of my faves in Cleveland!  I've gotten in here a few times when I come to town and it's always great.  Good food, good beer, live music on Thurs-Sat (maybe more).  They have a ton of excellent whiskeys at the ready and the bartenders always know how to make a good Snakebite.  Terrific.  Flannery's is within easy walking distance of most of the hotels downtown and the arena  - no reason you can't get in here next time you're staying in the area or catching a show at The Q.  I even brought my wife and daughter here once for dinner and drinks, that's how great it is.    I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Flannery's is a nice place to go for a couple of beers. The food is decent. I never suggest to friends that we go here. I am usually taken here by somebody. Nothing too cool has ever happened to me here. I am really drawing a blank on this one."}
{"text":"went there sat nite for a late supper as everything else on 4th st was closing. the place was busy as March Madness was still on but he got seated quickly. the food is ok pub grub. nothing special but decent.  i would go here to watch a game and drink soem beer."}
{"text":"I would probably give Flannery's a 3 1/2 if I could. The food was mediocre, the service was excellent, and their beer selection is good, but too pricey for what it is. I'll likely return since it's in walking distance."}
{"text":"We stopped here before the Browns game.  They had a reduced menu due to both the Browns and Indians playing.  They had $3 Miller Lites.  I had a Miller Lite and their $11 cranberry nut salad.  The salad was good.    We had a large group and the waitress did a good job serving everyone and recommending drinks.  It's a good stop for pre-game fun but not much on the food side."}
{"text":"Update #2: Overall, we had a blast attending the Cavs game and the experience here was warm and welcoming! Food was your typical bar food  Update! They were out of pickles. Will update again if the food was good  We called 2 hours in advance to put our name on the list and they told us they did not take reservations on event nights. When we arrived there were multiple tables with \"Reserved\" tents on the table."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in here the night before Valentine's day and we had a blast! The New Barleycorn band was playing and what great music and comedy! We stumbled in completely by mistake and now plan to come back next time The New Barleycorn is playing again. We had drinks and the spinach and artichoke dip. The spinach and artichoke dip was fresh and probably the best we'd ever had!"}
{"text":"Good stop in between shopping.  Definitely get the basket of wedge potatoes. Enough seasoning and you get TONS for $4."}
{"text":"Nice and slow Sunday evening with my family I ordered the fish and chips traditional think hunk of cod with Guinness batter. Our waiter Tim was areal nice dude who took good care of us.. my son gave 8 of 10 stars for the spicy garlic wings, Wife had a delicious cranberry walnut  salad and daughter # 2 had the turkey club that was \"good\".  This will earn a return visit when we head back to the  big C."}
{"text":"Nice enough looking bar.  Staff was hit or miss with some good and some indifferent.  My friend got threatened by a bum here and the staff didn't really seem equipped to handle that type of situation.  Considering their location you'd think they'd have better security.  I guess that's Cleveland for ya."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Flannery's!!! I love coming out here for some drinks on a Friday or Saturday night. I'm also a fan of their food, so I love grabbing dinner here- great atmosphere, especially when there is live music!  My favorite item on the food menu is probably the southwestern rolls... absolutely DELISH! I highly recommend them. The Pan Fried mozzarella is good, too, but you can't really mess that up... The Spicy garlic chicken sandwich is my favorite entree there!! I get ranch instead of the blue cheese and it's one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had (granted, I JUST started eating chicken, so you may not feel the same).... The portabella sandwich is ehhhhh.... not a huge fan... the portabella wasn't cooked completely through when I had it and my personal preference is that it needs to be soft when I bite into it. Finally, the mac & cheese is a whole lotta cheesy goodness and it hits the spot (GOUDA in mac&cheese?? yes please!)  Haven't tried their fries, but their side caesar is good, there's something in their croutons that make them extra tasty!  I'd highly recommend Flannery's to anyone. It usually gets pretty crowded on a Fri or Sat night, but if you shove your way past the crowds at the bar, I've found that the back room usually has a few empty tables (now that I've shared my secret, I'll probably never find a table again.... :-\ ) It's a great location, so if you're ever looking for dinner/drinks before a game/concert, this place is convenient and worth it :)"}
{"text":"Decent and spacious pub near a lot of other fun local bars. This is your typical pub - they have a few activities like skeeball, the staff is pretty friendly, and they have a good and cheap selection of beers."}
{"text":"Having experienced major food poisoning from an appetizer here, I have sworn to never take another bite of anything that comes out of their kitchen.  However, it's pretty hard to mess up beer - which they have a good selection of and the location is hard to beat.  A good place to stop in before or after a game (or during if the score is bad) for a drink or two...but don't eat the food."}
{"text":"Rated low on service just because they always seem to be understaff. Great place though and awesome food."}
{"text":"I love this place, seriously! Every single visit, no matter how busy and packed it is, the staff are always super friendly and nice. That is a huge plus in my book and with the good food (corned beef sliders and the wings are my go to), it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and i stopped in cleveland for a night and looked for a place open late and flannerys was still lively and kitchen was even open! They had authentic irish dishes and drinks it was really cool. Id reccomend to anyone into this style of food and spirits."}
