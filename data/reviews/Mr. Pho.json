{"text":"What a great spot for dine in or carry out!  Everything tastes fresh and the service is fast.   Ask for the vegan menu!  It isn't on the regular menu, but they have lots of tasty options on a separate menu!  Been here twice now and the food and service have been excellent!"}
{"text":"First I walk inside the restaurant it look nice. I am really happy this place was open. I order bun thit nuong with egg roll. When I got home open up I see really thick pork chop. Really? I order that nuong not pork chop. Well I still try it out. Meat no good. Fish sauce really no flavor taste like fish sauce add water. Restaurant look nice. Service ok. Food 0 star."}
{"text":"I have many Pho noodles in authentic Vietnamese town in DC.  This place is just as authentic.  Clean new place and visible kitchen.  Friendly and fast service staffs."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I was hoping to have a new Pho place closer to home but I haven't found one yet. I ordered the pho. My husband had the bun. Both were bland. I was not impressed with the spring roll either. They served them with a duck sauce? instead of nuoc mam which I had to request. The sauce had nothing in it! Perhaps fish sauce with the usual ingredients (garlic, daikon, sugar, lime, etc.) would add more flavor to all their dishes."}
{"text":"This place is straight trash. GARBAGE. Never go. Food was warm at best. Got the pho and bun bo hue. Both was trash. I looked the waitress dead in the eye and asked her if the bun bo hue was good, she answered with a straight face \"best in town\" Jesus I would hate to taste the worst in town if this is the best. The best part of my meal was the fact the owner came out and asked if I wanted to change my dish because she could see I was unhappy. I doubt anything else here was good so I declined and politely ate more in front of her. Honest recommendation? Buy a plane ticket go to Vietnam, and order food there. That would probably be worth the price of not eating here and having to deal with this awful taste in your mouth. Coffee was good, small portion, no meat. Decent service"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Staff was very nice. They showed me the right way to eat vermicelli noodles and it might be my new favorite Vietnamese food. Don't be shy with the sauce in the little black dish! Pour it all over the noodles. The sauce and the meat is where the flavors at. I got beef, shrimp, and chx. Definitely coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch after reading good reviews, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. First, they got rid of the vegetarian menu which is whatever, so I ordered shrimp fried rice, which was the least offensive thing I could think of. It was over $10 and I assumed that meant it would be a big portion. Wrong. It was a small amount of rice and was very sloppily put on my plate. Taste was good, however, if you don't mind de-casing and cleaning your shrimp as you eat them... the score was a 95, which is only a little below what I'm comfortable with. So now I'm just hoping to God I don't spend the next 48 hours puking my guts up, as I'm already unsettled.   We'll put the cherry on the cake by adding that I had to ask for the check and to be able to pay. Was never checked in on, water never topped off, nothing. I tipped, but only because I'm not an as*hole. Won't be coming back, tbh."}
{"text":"Went for the Grand Opening, Had high hopes, very nice atmosphere and great service from when I walked in.  I asked for a to go menu and since they didn't have yet she gave me 2 menus to take to car.  This place was off to a great start! This is where they earned the 1 star.    That's where it ended......my \"to go\" dinner was a huge waste of money.  In fact, after getting the food home and trying it (which I REALLY wanted to like) I had to put a frozen pizza in the oven.    Perhaps it was my mistake for not getting the Pho, but here's my review of the non-Pho dishes we tried/  1) Lemon pepper wings: RAW! And no lemon pepper flavor.  2)Pad Thai (medium spice), no spice, no flavor, and gross chicken chunks.  You know, the weird bites that you can't chew and end up politely spitting out into your napkin.   3) Chicken/beef rice plate: more gross chunks of chicken that I couldn't even find a decent bite, and I've now learned that beef can also have creepy gross pieces that you can't chew.   I thought Yoshinoya (west coast) used the absolute lowest quality cut of beef/chicken but Mr Pho you've impressed me (in the wrong way) by finding an even lower quality of meat!  I hope the Pho is better, but doubt I'll be back to try it considering there's an excellent Pho restaurant in Ayrsley, right down the street.  (And I'm skeptical that the Pho uses any higher quality cut of meat...)"}
{"text":"Came here couple days ago with my mom, i had the pho # 1, it was delicious. My mom also had the Bun Bo Hue and she love it. This will be my favorite place to go when I craving for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I will be back! Fresh & Delicious!! The restaurant is very nice and clean I enjoyed the summer rolls and the beef pho"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Warm and inviting the food here is so flavorful! My favorite place to go for vietnamese cuisine! Excellent customer service what's not to brag about this place?"}
{"text":"my food is ok. I wanted a green tea but no one asked if i wanted anything to drink. Servers want to be elsewhere... so do I honestly. There is a small restaurant at Ayrsley called Phô Ngon. They are much more welcoming and attentive. That's where I'll spend my money in the future!"}
{"text":"I love Mr. Pho!  I've done take out a few times, but this weekend I went in to eat.  Very clean, very modern.  Attentive staff and generous portions.  I strictly go for the pho ga, but my spouse loves the spring rolls and the vermicelli bowls.  I hope they succeed and stick around.  So convenient to the house."}
{"text":"First time stopping in here. I will update my review after a couple more visits. I am sure I will visit again.    I had the vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken. It was perfectly light with a nice mix of spice and cool front the pickled veggies. The staff were very pleasant and helpful in choosing the best menu selection.   Tables and space were spotless. Quite impressive for a new location."}
{"text":"Pretty under whelming Very thing was very bland and under seasoned  The fried eggrolls were too greasy The Pho was very ordinary and disappointing, not 10 dollars The Hanoi was the tastiness item The Bun Thit dishes were pretty sad as well,    The meat dry and under seasoned  The wonton soup was bad, dont order  Was really hoping for this place"}
{"text":"I have been to a few Pho places around Charlotte and this is definitely my new favorite. My team and I went here for an early lunch on a Thursday and service was great. I thought the pho was perfect (not overly spiced yet not watered down) and they are generous with the meat and noodles provided. Some got the vermicelli which they said was fantastic. We also got the strawberry bubble smoothies. I'm pretty sure it was fresh strawberries though the straws given were a little small for the bubbles. Overall, I'll definitely be back (and maybe next time I'll try their build a pho bowl)!"}
{"text":"I popped in for dinner on a Friday night. The place was busy but the service was quick and attentive.   I started with the Vietnamese egg rolls. They were delicious. They arrived crispy and hot and I love the dipping sauce that comes with them.   I kept it simple with dinner and ordered the Grilled Pork Vermicelli. Oh my goodness. It was perfect. And it's a good size portion, definitely enough for two meals.   I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING. Finally some authentic Vietnamese food in Charlotte.The opening day I heard was very busy, but the service was phenomenal and the food was better than I ever expected when I went Sunday, the day after. Pho broth is clean and fresh, the banh beo was so good! My gf LOVED the bun bo hue. Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in Charlotte!!! Definitely coming back! So happy to have an authentic Vietnamese restaurant to go to when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was at the nearby Lowe's and just noticed the sign for Mr. Pho. So decided to drop in for an early lunch. The decor was very nice compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. I had the Chicken Pho and the broth was great! They only had white meat in the Pho and my preference is dark meat and would have preferred a mixture of white and dark meat. I'm probably just nitpicking as many Pho places only use white meat as I'm guessing that's what most patrons want? The complimentary spring roll was EXCELLENT! I'll definitely order that next time. Looking forward to trying other dishes and super excited Charlotte has a new tasty Vietnamese restaurant in this area of town!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Pho noodle soup was bland. I ordered a combination plate with a shrimp cake that was soaking in oil--unlike what was pictured on the menu. I told the wait staff and they wouldn't correct it. There were 2 other parties dining at the restaurant when we were there, not a good sign. I would not return."}
{"text":"I came to Mr. Pho because Doan's closed on Tuesdays and I'm so glad I did! Being Vietnamese I'm super picky of where I get my pho and bun bo hue. I got bun bo hue and it did not disappoint. When it came out it didn't have much color in it like most restaurants but the flavor was so authentic! It had everything a bun bo hue should have (see pic for details). Could have used a lil more variety on the veggies that went with it though. But overall, it was very delicious! I got a che/dessert togo that the owner recommended that has not been on the menu yet. Very delicious! Prices were very reasonable as well. Hope everything will stay consistent. I will be back to try other stuff on the menu.   Food- 5/5 Service- 5/5 (came on a Tuesday afternoon)  Price- 5/5"}
{"text":"Food was very fresh and the staff was friendly. So far, best pho in town. We ordered the vegetarian pho with tofu, stir fry beef and vegetables and avocado smoothies, one with boba."}
{"text":"Some people leaving these god awful reviews are idiots. Ok, yeah they just opened so there are a few kinks that need to be worked out but the food is DELICIOUS. But what new establishment is going to be perfect. It's a family owned restaurant! Cut them a break and try them again before posting. Like really? You're mad because you didn't get a napkin with your FREE appetizer?! You were already mad when you walked in. The space is beautiful, the staff is nice and  I love that you can customize your pho and rice bowls.  I had the shrimp and rice and it was so good. Next time I'll try the pho when it's not so hot out. Great addition to the Steele Creek area! My new fav Vietnamese spot!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are very fresh. The chicken pho is really good. I just found this place as my plane was landing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambiance.  I highly recommend these guys if you are into Vietnamese food.  Pho and Spring Rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I really like Vietnamese food. My favorite dish is the rice vermicelli with tofu. The rice vermicelli is a light fresh dish, but Mr. Pho makes the vegetarian one more that a gross stir fry. Most Vietnamese restaurants put fried tofu but not the weird sautéed mushrooms. They really do a poor job on their vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"Saw the sign about Grand Opening while going to store nearby. Decided to stop by and get some takeout. It was about 7pm tonight. Saw a sign for free egg roll and drink because of the Grand Opening. Oct 28-Nov 3. We are very familiar with Vietnamese food and order grilled pork with rice, egg rolls and chicken wings. Did not get our free drink for take out, but no big deal. Beautiful atmosphere and ambience. We just felt that instantly, the staff was unprofessional in dealing with customers as they did not seem to know how to welcome customers. But hey, we were for the food so we tried to look over that initial awkwardness. When I placed the order, the Vietnamese lady only spoke Vietnamese to me. I had no idea what she was saying ... Looked like it was owned by a lot of older people which is fine ... But maybe not many even spoke English? After the first lady took my order on a sticky yellow note after I pointed out what I wanted of which was written only in Vietnamese? She went and spoke to an older woman who told me I would get a free egg roll with my pork and rice order. I said sure! Order came out rather quick which was great.   I just also disliked that the women who worked there constantly spoke Vietnamese loudly. What if other Vietnamese customers are there and hear them talking crap about customers? To me, I felt I was in a nail salon where the Vietnamese talk about their customers. Just being honest.  Anyhow, the food? Egg rolls were not good nor were they fresh. Looked ugly and tasted like they were refried egg rolls. The egg rolls had no flavor except saltiness. Meh, unimpressed. We ate it in the car so didn't get to take a picture of the order itself. However, you will see it in the order with the pork and rice. As for the wings, unauthentic. Tastes like wings from any restaurant ... Just salty with a fried chicken powdered coating. Had egg roll sauce from a bottle as dip? Unimpressed. It was not authentic Vietnamese wings ... I go to a Vietnamese restaurant to get authentic Vietnamese food, not American style wings. Then down to the grilled pork ... The pork itself tasted ok, however, they were extremely skimpy on lettuce/ vegetables. And look at the picture ... The dipping sauce has no garlic, no cucumber, no carrots, literally just tasted like watered down fish sauce with some sugar.   The food quality and presentation did NOT match the beautiful new restaurant. The restaurant looked upscale, but the food was anything BUT that.  I haven't tried other foods, but this will be my first and last time. Service not good. Food was disappointing. Go here if you are close by and have no other choice, but there are definitely better options elsewhere with better quality and portions for the price.  The only reason why they get two (2) stars if for the beautiful restaurant. Food, nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Mr. Pho is finally open! I went in and the service was excellent. I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken pho), the chicken was super tender and the broth was so tasty. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Just moved here and thought I'd try this place close to my job. Glad I did-Bun just how I like it."}
{"text":"My favorite new Viet restaurant. I love the Banh Beo, got it every time I came. I also love the Hanoi pho - being that I am from Hanoi, I recognized the broth was very authentic. And the Bun Bo Hue was delicious, had huyet in it!"}
{"text":"I was actually excited to try this place out, but I must say I was pretty disappointed. The spring roll was too plain, the waiter did not once come ask us if we need it anything or refill our drinks and the pho large looks like a medium. I order the Vermicelli bowl to go and I'm not sure if the sauce was put on the noodles (which is a big no,no) or what, but I don't see it with my noodles (missing main ingredient). The only good thing that I had was the egg roll. It will probably be my first and last."}
{"text":"As if the Pho wasn't amazing on it's own but they have exceptional customer service! If you enjoy pho be prepared to be blown away with this restaurant. I will be returning shortly for my \"pho fix\""}
{"text":"My husband and I are in this area a lot and noticed a new restaurant was opening and could not wait to try it out. When we arrived, we were sat right away. The staff was very nice and attentive. The food came right away. The menu featured a good amount of food and we were pleased with the options given.  We started our meal off with some fresh spring rolls. They were tasty and some of the best we've had. Next we had some egg rolls that were apart of the opening weekend promotion. They were really good as well. Once we decided what we wanted, I ordered the steamed rice with a shrimp cake and grilled steak. The shrimp cake was good but not something I think I'd order again. The grilled steak was awesome. It almost had a Mongolian beef taste to it. The steamed rice was cooked to perfection. I had pineapple coconut smoothie with tapioca pearls that was really tasty and they served water with a hint of lemon that tasted fresh. My husband had the steamed rice with grilled shrimp and grilled steak. He said the grill shrimp were cooked perfect and had a great flavor. We both agreed on the grilled steak being our favorite of the meal.   The decoration is nice and modern, they have plenty of tables that would fit up to 6 people and the place was very tidy.   We cannot wait to come back and try more food, especially the Pho. The couple that sat behind us ordered it and spoke very highly of it. We have been looking for more Pho places in Charlotte that are actually good.   ..... So my husband and I decided to go back to Mr Pho after two days of our amazing experience to try their Pho.  My husband ended up changing his mind and he ordered steamed rice and steak and I went with Eye Round steak Pho. The food was amazing as the previous time, but we did not get the lemon water and the service was not got at all.  Took over 10 minutes to someone come to take our order and they went first to a table the got there way after ours. My husband food came after 7 minutes and mine took 11, which was fine Due to the lack of service this time I had to take off one start but we will of course be back and see what kind of service we will have next time, because I am convinced the food will be amazing!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I want to love this place for its convenience but I can't. We came in for late dinner around 8:50 pm on their grand opening. We got sit right away. The waiter took our order immediately in the rush. About 15 mins later brought out our complementary eggs rolls. I was plain and had no taste. Well. It's COMPLEMENTARY.   Here are the part that they should earn 0 star:  The silverware was visibly dirty with oil residues that had to replace and still looked dirty.  Our food came out AFTER 3-4 tables that came and ordered way AFTER us while we had been waiting for roughly 1 hour. The waiter was once apologizing for the mess up that the cook did. Per say, it looked like \"family friends\" tickets got to place ahead of \"regular paying\" customers.   Food FINALLY came, my pho was cold and much much oily in the broth. It didn't taste anything like Pho HaNoi as I had tasted many times before. The other pho was hot but still no taste and very oily.   For this kind of food and services, I will take my business as far as a could."}
{"text":"Had pho and bun no hue. Both were good and came out quick. Also got Che to go. Happy with our visit and will be back."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. Vietnamese fried rolls are the best thing on the menu.  Friendly staff and ask about their house made sauces."}
{"text":"Ordered mixed seafood pho and it was excellent flavor was good and the small bowl was more than enough couldn't even finish. I also had an order of rolls that came with peanut sauce all very tasty. On my way out I asked about hot coffee since it was a cold night in Charlotte and I was out of town. The lady came out the door and told me that she could make some for me I was so appreciative it was also very good."}
{"text":"The best Pho!!! Beautiful decor, clean, and fast service.  The owners are very involved and want to make sure you were happy."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals I've ever had!! I'm a vegetarian and came here based on a yelp review. I'm leaving the country tomorrow from the Charlotte airport and I am staying at a hotel near the airport. I came to this place and they gave me a vegetarian menu. I opted for the vegetable soup. They had some fake chicken and beef for vegetarians, but I like straight tofu. A nice woman who may be the owner brought me a spicy chili paste to try. It is homemade. I cannot say enough good things about it. Really, it is absolutely amazing one of the best things I've ever tried in my life."}
{"text":"My favorite place by far in Charlotte! I try to come here at least once a week to have their delicious seafood pho. The staff is nice, the venue is clean, and the food is always amazing! Everyone should definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. My favorite dish is the vermicelli. Everybody is nice and welcoming. Really great customer service. The restaurant is very nice looking inside. Sometimes I have a hard time in Asian restaurants because I don't really know what food I'm getting but this menu has a lots of pictures with really helpful translations. The staff also knows the menu very well and can answer any questions you may have."}
{"text":"My Co-worker and I come once a week. The pho here is probably the best in Charlotte. The broth here is extremely flavorful. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Great option for pho in Charlotte. Nice upscale atmosphere with quick and friendly table service. Since it was opening day, it was definitely crowded so the wait was a little longer than usual for Pho. But when it arrived, the broth was clean and flavorful. I also had the fresh spring rolls and a Vietnamese iced coffee which was strong and tasty. Sits in a nice location just off 485. Definitely look forward to returning here for authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I was on my lunch break and thought I'd give this place a try. I love Pho so this was right up my alley. It was good and filling. The wings were very good. We will try it again."}
{"text":"So glad there is finally a good and modern pho place in south Charlotte! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Pho is probably my favorite food.  Not the best pho I've had but it's worth a try.  The menu is really big and plenty of soups.  From bun bo hue to bun rieu to different regions of pho (north/south).  It's a bit fancy and pricey for pho but I understand the pricing.  I got the pho dac biet (special combination pho).  It was flavorful but I like Pho a little bit more home made.  More fat and a little bit more greasy.  These guys really know how to make restaurant quality pho, which is expected since you're going to a restaurant lol.  My wife and I will definitely be back to try their bun bo hue and other dishes. If you live in south Charlotte go give this place a try"}
{"text":"I love pho and wanted to give this new place a try. Well let's just say that I never ever not finished a bowl of pho. Especially on a cold fall day like today. We were greeted and seated quickly and the atmosphere was good. We ordered two appetizers and one each bowl of pho dac biet large and a regular bowl of bun bo hue. I was disappointed when the waitress brought out the pho and bun bo hue without any vegetables garnish, a key ingredient with pho! The very little helping of veggies garnish came about 3-4 minuets afterwards. Starving I started on my pho still waiting on the appetizers. The broth was mediocre at best with very little meat. It lacked the deep richness good pho broth has. After 15-20 minuets goes by another waitress asked if she could take my 70% uneaten pho away so I asked her to cancel our appetizer since we never got them. Then 5 minuets later I was told by the owner or manager that she never even relayed our appetizer order to the chef. I asked for the check and paid was when the only water refill was given which I kindly told him no thank you! Disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best places for Vietnamese food this side of Charlotte. The service is speedy and not bothersome, but also not distant. The food is spectacular and the drinks, as a person new to this food, sound weird but are wonderfully tasty. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I cannot express how delicious the soup is. Do yourself a favor and get a pho with round eye and meatballs. It is ridiculous how tasty it is. I have searched high and low for a good won ton soup and this is about the closest thing I can find. I'm excited to try the wontons when it becomes available. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place just opened so I was expecting top service from here. The atmosphere was cool. Met some new people because of the closeness of the tables. I ordered the seafood noodle soup and...It was very salty, had little flavor in the broth and lots of salt. The young lady next to me said she likes hers like that; however I enjoy more flavor than salt. I do not eat meat and occasionally indulge in seafood. Sad to say I did not enjoy it or the newness of them forgetting to bring things to my table. Will probably try once more for a vermicelli dish."}
{"text":"Food came out quickly & everything was so tasty! The service was exceptional! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Woohoo!! My first 2018 review. Thus far i've visited Mr.Pho twice in one week!!! Yes! I'm addicted.  So clearly it's colder than a penguins butt outside. Why not cozy up with a large bowl of Pho! I've had this restaurant bookmarked, and I couldn't wait to visit.  Mr.Pho is located in the Whitehall Commons Shopping Cente, next to Chili's Bar & Grill.   My first visit, I arrived on New Years Day for lunch. Only three tables were occupied, it became busier later. There's no hostess stand, someone from the register will seat you. Overall the restaurant is clean and well kept. You can see inside the kitchen (a little) floors and counters are clean. A++!!!  I hope they hire more staff. During both visits, I witnessed customers asking for more water, the check, additional napkins, a beer once or twice--that was clearly forgotten. The few people on staff were running from table to table. I'm sure this is overwhelming.   The menu offers plenty of options, which is great for customers with a limited pallet.   First visit:  I ordered the \"Lean Brisket\" Large, which was a great option! This Pho comes with Lean Brisket and noodles. The Pho comes with free side toppings ( Thai Basil, 1-lime wedge, bean sprouts, 2-jalapenos, mint leaves, and cilantro).   Second visit:  I ordered the \"Pho Special 3\" Large. Another great option! However, the meat has more fat.  This Pho comes with well-done flank, lean brisket tenderloin & shredded tripe noodle soup. The Pho comes with free side toppings ( Thai Basil, 1-lime wedge, bean sprouts, 2-jalapenos, mint leaves, and cilantro).   Vietnamese fried egg rolls - DELISH!!!!  Will I come back? Well Duh! Great food & prices, plus I live insanely close by!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow.  Double-top table stools are uncomfortable, no foot rest.   Good use of space in the restaurant.  Folks on the wall may feel a little close to those on other side though   Was served the complementary appetizer with no silverware or napkins.  The spring rolls, I swear, have meat in them-that may be a first.  They were cooked well but pretty standard frozen/fried product you can get at a grocery store.    The small pho was just the right size for me.    However I was not impressed at all.  The flavor was pretty much beef noodle.  The meat portion was also unimpressive. I've had much better pho at 3 or 4 places around this side of Charlotte. The small plate with basil, sprouts, jalapeño and lime was pretty sparse.    Not a terrible place to get pho, but much better options are available.  (And if this place is the best pho you've had in CLT, you really need to get out more!)"}
{"text":"The spring rolls and peanut sauce were fantastic. Everything was wonderful and freshly made. The menu has a lot of create your own options for those who are just starting out with Vietnamese food or for the less adventurous/picky eater. Beautiful inside and friendly and attentive staff. Will be returning."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm super impressed. Great ambiance, great service, great food. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place with my boyfriend.  Food was mediocre but service was crappy. We walked in at about 8:15pm, we were aware they close at 9pm. So we made sure to order quickly. Right when we walked in, an older woman approached us and asked, \"to go?\" (What the heck?!) I said \"umm no, we'll be dining in.\" We get seated and the waiter appears with waters about 3 mins in. Mind you they weren't busy at all. We both order combination pho (mine was a small and my boyfriends a large), spring rolls, and Steamed rice cakes.  My pho had so much noodles in it that it soaked up almost all the broth. But my boyfriends pho was portioned well.  The rice cakes were definitely not fresh because they brought it out way too quick and I know it takes a little while to make them. Plus it was cold.  Spring rolls were fine.  While we were eating we noticed they turned away 3 potential customers even though the open sign was on. I mean, at least turn it off if the kitchen is closed. The waiter never came to check on us but were quick to bring the check as well as pick up the check. We asked for more water but the waiter never brought it.  Moral of the story, don't go to Mr. Pho \"late\" or they'll give you lousy service.   Side note: Why have bottles of Hennessy on display but don't serve liquor?"}
{"text":"I've been going to mr pho since they opened. The are great and have amazing service. Tammy is always very welcoming and knows the menu forwards and backwards and can answer any questions. They always time their appetizers with the main dish perfectly. My favorite dish there(to date) is vermicelli with chicken, shrimp and egg rolls. Also try their tiger beer!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the Grand Opening and it was veryyyyyy busy. We beat the rush only by a few tables.  The food was awesome. I've been in Charlotte for a few years and it's been really hard to get good vietnamese food away from home (San Jose). Mr. Pho definitely compares to the food back home and it's my new go-to spot in Charlotte.   I got the #1 Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien and my girlfriend got the shaken beef (filet mignon) over garlic rice. She refused to stop eating for me to take the picture but here's what I was able to get.   Both were perfect. The pho had a really balanced flavor between a deep beef stock but still really light.  The rice was really moist and steak was perfectly cooked.   This sounds odd but I'm excited to see how this pho will handle my hangover next weekend.   P.S. I read some of the other reviews and it seems ppls experiences were heavily based on how busy it is. Hopefully he experience will be consistent once they figure out the logistical kinks."}
{"text":"I'm from California and came to Charlotte for a family reunion on the the weekend. My family was craving for some Vietnamese treats and luckily we stumbled  Mr Pho at their grand opening. I'm Vietnamese and come from California so... Vietnamese food expert here :)  We came to the restaurant after their lunch hour but still, the place was packed! Overall, we had a good experience. Yayy! First,  I'm surprised that their food is quite authentic and taste very similar to my go-to Viet food in where in live in San Jose.   I order a regular Pho with slice rare steak and beef balls. The steak was cooked well enough but still hold the soft/tender texture. The broth was so rich and flavorful that it was a blast of flavors in my mouth when I sip it. It is a must! It came with fresh beansprout, basil, jalapeno, and lime. Really good! My mom order the vermicelli with grilled shrimp and pork. She liked it very well! We also ordered fresh spring rolls with fresh shrimp/pork and veggies inside. It was very fresh and I could tell it was freshly made, not premade and microwaved! The service was decent. Waiters are attentive and food come out very fast. I would come here again if I will be in town and would definitely recommend Mr Pho! If you aren of not sure of what to order and confused about the menu, ask away. They did a good job advertising their food selection."}
{"text":"This pho wasn't the best but it wasn't bad. Portions were huge as it usually goes with pho. The beef in mine was pretty nasty, very fatty and just gross, I had to take it all out. I had an appetizer of wing which were pretty good, the sweet chili sauce served as dip was really tasty. The decor is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"So awesome to have an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in South CLT! The food was awesome - the spring rolls, Pho Ga and Spicy Beef Soup were so flavorful. The service was wonderful and the owner, Emily, helped educate us about the right food to order! We will be back again and again for this Vietnamese comfort food!"}
{"text":"We've got a new phenomenal Pho restaurant in Steele Creek and I am super excited!! The location is great and the inside is beautiful.    For some reason I really wanted to go to the opening and the food lived up to my expectations!!! This may be the best tasting Vietnamese food in the Steele Creek area.   We did come super late and had to wait. There were a few hiccups because it was the opening but the owners son came out and spoke with us. He thanked us for visiting and that service and speed would improve. He also stated that he was from San Fran area of Cali and that his mom was trying to bring more of the west coast to the east coast!!! I'm sooo excited. The chef also came out because we had a mix up with the rice dish my sister ordered.   Everything we ordered was tasty. I ordered the Mi Hoanh Thanh and the broth was good. The wontons seemed a little cold but overall I was satisfied. My sister loved her Fried rice with Pork and Shrimp dish. The Pho broth is amazing. It's the prefect blend of spices. Not to heavy on any of the particular spices.   Mr. Pho is my new go to for Viet food in the Steele Creek area!!!

{"text":"It was my first time there, me and a couple co workers decided to try them out actually. Soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated right away (no wait time). The waitress was pleasant and explained everything we needed to know(we asked questions). The food was made promptly so it was served hot and the flavors were delicious (i will be back) at the end we got rang up and the owners (i think) came out and spoke with us and gave us some background of the company and how long they had been there (6 weeks).... needless to say we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I got the wonton soup.  The description said it would come with rice or egg noodles.  I didn't specify that I wanted egg noodles, and the server didn't ask, so I got rice noodles.  I ate everything in my bowl, minus the rice noodles.  I didn't leave hungry.  I'm glad a restaurant is filling in this spot that seems to be cursed with keeping tenants."}
{"text":"I ordered lemon wings.  Tripe with rice noodle soup.  Chicken with egg noodle soup.  I paid for my to go order when I placed the order.    A young lady brought me my to go order and hesitated.  She asked me if I had paid before she handed me my order.  It was clear she was concerned about her payment.  I responded yes and toot my order to my car.  I briefly checked my order before leaving.  I did not have my wings.  I returned and the lady did dot apologize, she told me I left without allowing her to give me the wings.  What?  I explained the lady who confirmed I paid should have confirmed I had all my food before she gave it to me two bags.  I got home to find the chicken did not have lemon flavor.  My tripe soup did not have tripe!  I called the restaurant to express my disappointment.  The lady explained my my tripe may have shifted into my noodles and the chicken had lemon powder and that is why  I could not taste the lemon.  Really!  Later, I did find the teaspoon of tripe that was hidden by the noodles as she said.  The food had no flavor.  I told her I was very disappointed and I would not return.  I hate not giving a good review, but this was was not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Pho I've ever had and it's reasonably priced. Will always recommend!"}
{"text":"Love their Bean Curd shrimp cakes, pho, bun cha ha Noi and their desserts the Tri color yum! The place is really nice modern and clean too"}
{"text":"Place is clean and has a contemporary look. I had the wonton soup. The wontons were very tasty. The dough was different but not bad. The broth had flavor but lack a bit of salt. They had all the fixings to add to the soup so it was good. The Thai tea wasn't that good. It was a bit watery. Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"While I'm sad Noodles and Company closed, this restaurant is a much better addition to our restaurant scene.   We came here for lunch and I was more than impressed. The service was pretty fast, the food was delicious, and prices were reasonable.   We got two Rice Vermicelli Bowls - one beef and one egg roll. This is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes that I've ever had. It was all fresh, the flavors worked great together, and it didn't need an overpowering sauce to taste delicious. They were light and fresh -- I will probably get one every time I come back. They bring you egg rolls as a complementary appetizer which are phenomenal. We also got an avocado smoothie which was delicious.   This is a much needed addition to the restaurant scene in the area! Come support a great Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Always consistent food, quick and service is good. Chicken soup my fav! Spring roll is super yummy"}
{"text":"Been multiple times and have never had a bad dish or a bad experience. The pho is some of the best I've ever had and they have a great coconut and red bean drink. You can tell they put a lot of heart into their food.  I would highly recommend their house chilli sauce, makes siracha look weak and has a great lemon grass flavor."}
{"text":"The food is delicious...the service is quick, what more can you ask for. I usually come here once a week, I'm determined to try every shrimp and vegetable dish available.  I'm glad Mr. Pho is here, this area was in need a  new restaurant."}
{"text":"On a cold day (yes, it gets cold in North Carolina), we headed over to Mr. Pho for a soup dinner. I was pleased to see that they do have a lot more than just pho and a variety of those too. Chicken, various beef soups and a whole stack of rice and vermicelli dishes too.  Service was okay. They were clearly overwhelmed by the number of customers but the staff was trying hard.  The only thing that was a little confusing was paying at the end which involved knowing my table number since no actual check was presented."}
{"text":"Omg I loved it. One of my favorite Pho Spots ever! I get Pho in every city I go to and ib really enjoyed this place! I highly recommend. Clean and nice atmosphere, friendly service and great food. We'll be back!"}
