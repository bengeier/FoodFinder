{"text":"Une belle découverte!  Des saveurs vietnamiennes authentique servi avec le sourire. De plus ici ils ne servent aucun animaux morts. Les végétariens et végétariens seront bien servi... les carnivores seront confondues. La nourriture est si succulente que l'on n'oublie qu'ils ne servent aucune chair animale dans leur restaurants. Bravo enfin saveurs et service sont au rendez vous pour des mets vietnamiens santé!"}
{"text":"I went on Happy Cow desperately looking for a vegan restaurant in east Montreal and saw this restaurant.  It is a Buddhist restaurant with vegan temple food.  Vegan temple food is the art of making vegan food tasty, not necessarily making it all taste like meat but a lot of effort is put into making mock meats.  The food here is of high quality, and really inexpensive with most complete plates coming in at $6.99 each.  The Three Rainbow Rice plate was fresh and tasty,  the Vermicelles with the Tofu Citronelle made you forget that you would want meat with your meal which is the whole point (You have to order the General Tao tofu dish, way better than the greasy original with chicken!)   I have gone there over time and tried all the dishes, some are better than others but all are above par.   There is one particularity about the restaurant, it's the all you can eat buffet.  I love it when I am really hungry, but it reminds me of Asian food courts. With the buffet you take a plate on top of the counter, walk behind the counter and choose what you want to eat, then you microwave the food yourself, then open the rice cooker and top off your plate with a scoop of rice. The variety of food is limitless. And it becomes a chance to taste so many different foods.  You can do this as many times as you want.  All this for $12.00!   The surprising part is how packed it becomes with mostly Asian and Vietnamese people and how you see so many Asian people coming from Halifax, Toronto and New York and eat there.  The décor is simple and efficient, the atmosphere is relaxed with many families eating together.  The owner is lovely, talking to people and setting a really friendly atmosphere.  Personally I am willing to trade in the overly decorated dining room for authentic tasty food experience. The service is very laid back and friendly, and I noticed that people lingerering to talk at the tables and with the staff.   I prefer inexpensive relaxed atmosphere of places like this which remind me so much of my trips to Asia.  (Eating the best Durian ever, sitting on a red plastic stool next to a tiny van!)"}
{"text":"Small restaurant in convenient location with parking. Menu had tons of interesting options but waiter was difficult to understand (language barrier). He suggested the $12 buffet so we said why not as we wanted to try a few different things. There were lots of interesting options that were all very tasty, however, the food was quite cold. What a bummer. I did order a small soup from the a la carte menu, which was made to order, therefore hot (and tasty for that matter). I would return here but I'd order from the menu instead of doing the whole buffet thing."}
{"text":"Really good vegan inexpensive vietnamese food!! I love the general Tao!!    I wish the place was nicer and warmer...during cold moths is always freezing!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to this restaurant. I was very apprehensive in the beginning as I never venture this far. I was pleasantly surprised by the food. They have a buffet for 12$, I regret not getting that actually. They had tons and tons of dishes to try and they all looked delicious. We ordered spring rolls that were pretty good and we had rice noodles with veggies and lemongrass friend tofu that was good. Keep in mind this is a family run restaurant, the ambiance is very colorful and bright."}
{"text":"The first time I came, I had only been a vegan for less than a month. At that time I wasn't able to realize how superior Pho Da Son was compared with other Buddhist restaurants. Now, after I've tried several others Buddhist restaurants in New York City, it's clear Pho Da Son is among best. In fact, I often speak nostalgically of the food there, and tell all my vegan or Buddhist friends that we need to plan a road trip to Montreal just to eat the food there again.  There is plenty of seating, with a classic food court style counter maintaining more than 20 selections. Food is prepared ahead of time, and is entirely self serve. So you grab a plate, choose what you want, and heat it up in the microwave. There is also rice noodles, Pad Thai and white rice available in the fridge. I wrote down a list of food I can recognize from the selection: - Stuffed bitter melon - Pumpkin - Mushroom - Tofu cake - Tofu Skin (red tofu skin is a little sweet, I think it's trying to be char siu,  and brown tofu skin is savory, cooked in soy sauce) - Taro - Mixed vegetables cooked in coconut curry - Mixed vegetable stir fry  In addition, the people there are super nice. At first they thought I was Vietnamese so they didn't pay much attention to me. However, when they realized I was not, and that I wasn't familiar with the setting, they helped me pick some food. They also reminded me there were noodles in the fridge, if I didn't want rice. They topped it off by helping heat up my food in the microwave (given I didn't know how long to heat).  The food had such an influence on me that soy nuggets have now become my go-to comfort food. I will definitely be back!"}
