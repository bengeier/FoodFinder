{"text":"Tried their nutella and pistachio gelato.  Average taste.  Nothing memorable.  It was 116 degrees in vegas today so had to have something cold!  Price is fair.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This is not food it is complete junk. If you want to die soon eat this stuff otherwise avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great snickers and banana fosters ice cream. Will be back in the future. Decent prices too"}
{"text":"Ciao Ciao Cafe and Bar is another one of my go-to stops after walking through The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for gelato! Sure, $9.99 for a medium sized gelato is a bit pricy, but the creaminess and burst of flavors of all gelato makes it all worth it. For a medium, you can get a good few scoops in a cute little cup. It does get a bit too sweet after each bite, so have water on the side and be open to share this with someone else! This time I went for half Snickers and half Strawberry Cheesecake. A perfect pick-me-up after walking through bougie stores that I cannot afford. Lol!   Note: Find this right next to the huge H&M!"}
{"text":"Workers seem nice, except for the fact they get pushy on upselling additional scoops of average gelato (I got taramisu and something else I can't remember). Hopefully this isn't the best gelato Vegas has to offer... there's plenty of places in Vancouver where the scoops are cheaper, more flavours to choose from, and better quality too."}
{"text":"I was a HUGE fan of the Ciao Ciao restaurant that was on Durango and Peace. The BEST clam linguine I've ever had, with excellant portions and it was reasonably priced. The gelato was fantastic as well. I was extremely disappointed to learn that they closed to make a Cafe in the forum shops. The restaurant was always busy, so I'm not sure why thet condensed everything down to this cafe. I want the old Ciao Ciao back."}
{"text":"The most AMAZING bananas foster gelato!  They used to have a full restaurant off of the strip that was much cheaper.  I would buy the largest size possible and keep it in my freezer."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!  None of the employees offering  you free samples have a smile on their face. They all look like they've been sucking on a very sour lemon. The cashier is even worse. I guess I expect too much out of these minimum wage people. I figure, I pay $20 for gelato  it better be good and the service better be satisfactory. Bottom line NEVER come here again for crappy service !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was really nice but the sorbetto was overly sweet. We got the strawberry and mango in a \"mid-size\" to share. I was bummed that the server leveled off the top, but to her defense she does pack it in there and probably is told to level it off, but once I tasted it I was glad there was less of it to share. The flavors were extremely artificial due to all of the excessive sugar. We both agreed we would not come back."}
{"text":"Nice bartender, though she skimped on the very expensive rum and coke. Cramped as heck to sit there and eat/drink because it's right smack in the middle of the Caesars Forum Shops traffic, but if you need to take a break and grab a slice of pizza, a humongous Long Island iced tea, or some gelato while shopping, I guess this is your best option around there."}
{"text":"If you like paying a million dollars for gelato, this place is for you!  Looks pretty in the case but the sticker shock is not worth it."}
{"text":"After standing in line for 10 mins, the cashier ignored me, started speaking with someone else who just showed up and then very quickly left. Just wanted to buy some over-priced water ($5)."}
{"text":"Tiramisu gelato tastes like pure heaven   The marscapone toffee with pistachios was a'ight. There were too many pistachios...which, I guess according to your preference, could be a good or bad thing.   They let you have as many samples as you'd like, but when it comes to the actual purchasing of gelato, they make SURE you don't get more than the top of the cup. They actually scoop gelato off the top so that your cup of gelato ends up flat. Ciao Ciao is pretty pricey, too... so I don't see why they don't let you have a little extra of gelato above the top of the cup! I was super disappointed when they put the tiramisu over the marscapone toffee, so I only got a bit of the tiramisu since they scraped most of it off. Lame. Because of this, I recommend either telling them to scoop in your first choice flavor first or only getting the single flavor cup option."}

P R I C E  This spot is pricey due to convenience. Refreshments easily run you over $4 a bottle!"}
{"text":"Great place for a fast treat and wait for the forum show to start! There are many favors of gelato  and you can sample them before ordering.  It cost $6.95 for one flavor scoop and $7.95 for the cup like cone with one or two flavor. The kids and I shared a VIP for $9.99 - 3 flavors of gelato.  It was great since each of us got to pick a flavor. The cup comes with the order and if you are looking for a small momentum without extra a cost you can save it.  Just need to walk over to the bathroom for a quick rinse."}
{"text":"Terrible and high-priced food.  Mean manager.    Had a $8+ hot dog.  Got to taste good, right? Wrong!  After drinking my $5 latte I feel thirsty so I ask for a little hot water.  Guess what, the manager asked me for 75c.  \"it's just 75c!\" she said.  I walked away and would never go back.  If you like high priced low quality food plus poor service, go for it!"}
{"text":"CIAO CIAO CAFE & BAR While shopping at the Forum Shops inside Caesar's Palace, we happened to end up in between the Ciao Ciao Cafe & Bar while browsing through H&M. It was a refreshing site, as a wall of gelato popped up in front of us, with all its dazzling colors, toppings, and rainbow burst! It screamed \"Cool! Refreshing! Smooth! Sweet! Tasty! Gelato!!!\" I couldn't help it and promptly ordered a VIP size: large cup with 3 flavors. We ordered, from bottom to top: White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake, Super Imperial Pistachio, and Raspberry Sorbetto. In addition, the server gave us two white chocolate slices on top of our 3-layer gelato heaven ^)^ It was so goooooooooooood!!! It made shopping inside the Forum bearable, as sugary sweetness took over! If you're looking for alcohol in addition to your gelato, you can order any drinks there too, as they have a sizable bar. Next time: White Russian and Gelato!!! The prices are way more expensive then your average gelato shop, but then again, it's Las Vegas. $10 for 3-flavors! but in the end, totally worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is a great fast option inside Caesars palace. One of the only quick and cheap food options there. The hot dogs are huge and taste pretty good. The waffle fries are good too except ours were a little burned."}
{"text":"This place is awful! So expensive and for nothing!! The worst customer service ever we had an ice cream and found a small plastic chip inside!!!!  We told the manager so old skinny blond and she was do rude like we are working for her.she have the worst attitude ever!"}
{"text":"Nice selections of Gelato and the best I've tried, ever. I don't particularly go out of my way to look for these types of desserts. We went into Cesar's Palace to see the  Fall of Atlantis and as we were walking out we noticed the fun blinking lights on the cups and I thought being this place is located within the mall it would be expensive. The prices weren't too bad as for a souvenir cup with your choice of three gelato flavors is $9.99 and they really pack it in topped with whipped cream and a cherry. I chose strawberry cheesecake and it's delicious with huge cheesecake chunks. The other flavor was the bananas foster with real banana pieces and a chocolate kind with brownie pieces. All flavors went together like a napoleon which turned out pretty well. This place also offers pizza, hot dogs, nachos, beer and other alcoholic drinks. Vegas is so much fun and really love all the different kinds of shops like this."}
{"text":"A cafe located inside Caesar's Forum. I didn't have their food so I can't comment on those but their gelato is creamy, cold and delicious."}
{"text":"While touring around Caesars Palace I stopped by this little cafe to try out the gelato. What caught my attention was the interesting \"cups\" that they were selling for the gelato that came in three different sizes if my memory is correct. I got the smallest size just to give it a try and it gave me the limit of three gelato flavors. I went with strawberry, vanilla, and mint chocolate chip. I'm not a fan of any other flavors besides vanilla, but I had decided to give it a try, plus the way it was served looked amazing. While my three flavor layers were being served I asked for the whipped cream and they served it with what seemed a triangle shaped waffle cookie? I am not too sure. For the taste, I first tried the mint chocolate chip, it was rich in flavor, creamy, and delicious. That is all I can say for the other flavors they didn't really have that artificial taste, they tasted natural. I ended up paying around $10 which isn't too surprising considering it is Vegas and everything is going to be pricey, but it was worth it. It can get really crowded to the point where it is difficult to order so that's a heads up. If you're near the forum shops, then you should give the gelato a try."}
{"text":"***Ciao Ciao's gelato is pretty good but also very overpriced (even for Las Vegas)***  Ciao Ciao is a gelato bar inside The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They have a good number of flavors and many of them appeared to be creative concoctions with lots of ingredients mixed in.  I went with the pistachio and the mascarpone with caramel and both flavors were good.  The gelato was creamy too.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Pricing was very high.  I ordered a medium size and it was $8 before taxes.  While I did not get the gelato at the more famous Jean Philippe in Aria, I think the gelato there was about the same price (maybe even less at Jean Philippe).  Ciao Ciao's gelato was a satisfying frozen dessert.  Pricing was too high though.  Pricing is high for a lot of stuff in Vegas, but I think for the prices you will pay here, you should be able to find more interesting and more well known sweets elsewhere.  The Forum Shops and Caesars offer complimentary parking (via valet or self parking structure)."}
{"text":"Yumm the pizza is sooooo good! I am a fan of there Gelato and they serve it so fancy. There is a bar in the other counter and the set up just makes you want to drink all day. They will make your drink just right. It is a little pricey but it's worth every cents. Also it being the Forum shops I think it's priced right, it's VEGAS people. I will go back there again and again! The customer service was excellent No one ignoring you when your dying for a cocktail unlike the BAR in the CASINO."}
{"text":"This is the best bloody mary I have had in my entire life. I am literally drinking it at Ciao Ciao while writing this. Jill is some kind of a genius, wizard mad scientist. She is amazing. Go here when you are in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Very good ice cream, very pricey (10) but worth the try. The water on the other hand was 5.75... Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is good! But pricey. The smaller cup is $10. They let you try all the flavors you want and they are all sooo good! I don't regret buying one and encourage those who go for the first time to get one. I got the banana foster cheesecake and tiramisu and pistachio, all very delicious!"}
{"text":"Very pricey. We had the $10 cups and the strawberry cheesecake was ok. The Chocolate gelato was pretty decadent and the cookies-n-cream was alright."}
{"text":"Really good gelato and sorbet! Located in the middle of the forum shops and has lots of tables with a view of the Atlantis show.   We got the mango sorbet which has a really great mango flavor and the sea salt caramel which was really rich and creamy. Both are must try's!"}
{"text":"5 stars for JILL at the Ciao Ciao Bar last week. She was so awesome and friendly & made a great half-yard margarita for me! She totally made my day :)"}
{"text":"Kid trap.  Below mediocre gelato, definitely not the worlds best as it  claims. $6.25 each and $7.99 if you want 2 flavors.   Look at the size compared to my water bottle cap. Don't get trapped by their offer of a taste. You can see the scheme steaming from their eyes, but my kids had already been reeled in so it was too late.  $30 for 4 tiny bowls of not very good stuff.  The water cap is located on the \"larger\" two flavors cup."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 stars  This place is located in the Forum. I wanted something sweet after eating at Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. I had tried the strawberry chocolate and the mascarpone pistachio. I couldn't decide between the two. I originally went for the small size, but was encouraged to go for the mid-size since it holds two flavors. I thought the two gelato flavors were good. The pistachio was soggy though.   The only reason that I wouldn't come back is that I would want more gelato for $8. It was really expensive for the size of the gelato."}
{"text":"Pretty good gelato when it comes to the flavors, but they're a bit icy and not that smooth when it comes to the texture. This isn't the first time I've had gelato, so I know theirs could be better. They also sell really huge hot dogs by the register. We got the smallest size cup which comes with either 1 or 2 flavors for $7.99. Overall, the price isn't bad at all for the sizes, but not really worth the quality."}
{"text":"Expensive but delicious gelato. I walked around the forum shops eating it. Some random  lady came up to me and thought it was a drink and asked where I got it. Only in Vegas when people thinks that gelato are drinks."}
{"text":"This place is very expensive and bad service.   I order small ice cream but they give me mid size. I said I want small size but they refuse to change for me.  The lady at cashier ignore what I said. How's bad!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very torn about this eatery. On the one hand, I could die happy without ever having another ice cream after trying their chocolate moose fudge pie gelato (even better than it sounds!). Then on the other hand, I did not think the pricing was particularly reasonable even for Vegas. The service was slow, and with the exception of one employee, I didn't think the workers were very nice either. Since service can vary by circumstance, I give them the benefit of the doubt, but my non-eating experience here was not good."}
{"text":"They're cheap with their samples but the tiny spit that I got to try of the Italian pistachio supreme was delicious! I got a small. You pay by the sizes and can get as many flavors as you want. My small order was $10! It was good but I think I was paying for the cup."}
{"text":"I am conflicted about this place and I don't know how many stars to give it.  I need to separate my ratings.  For the gelato bar alone, I give Ciao Ciao Cafe five stars.  The gelato is the best gelato I have ever had and it is displayed so prettily in the case.  Located right outside H&M in Caesar's Palace, this place is a MUST for me every time I come to Vegas.  I love their Chocolate Mousse Pie gelato!!  And even the wafer they stick into your gelato is ono!  And the hugest H&M is right next door!!  However, I give their regular food (pizza, nachos) one star.  It's terrible, even for fast food, and I'm amazed at their high price for a tiny personal size pizza and nachos.  The quality of their food is poor and very forgettable.  Don't eat here if at all possible.  I know it's hard, considering that there aren't many fast food cafe places located in Caesar's Palace.  Just eat the ice cream for lunch on your break from shopping at H&M.  That's what I do."}
{"text":"Really liked this place! Nice, creamy, though expensive (but what do you expect when in Vegas) gelato! The people working there gave us plenty of samples, and it's definitely a welcome relief when walking around all day in the Las Vegas sun! Near the Atlantis show in Caesar's Palace, you get two drinks for a hefty price, but you're in Vegas, why not?"}
{"text":"If I could give these guys negative stars I would. Besides the overpriced gelato, their service is terrible and do not get me started on attitudes.we purchased our gelato but couldn't even get a small cup of water for my kids. We were forced to buy a $5 bottle of water.  Keep your money and a nice slice of cheesecake or a nice tiramisu instead of this overpriced, poor excuse for gelato."}
{"text":"Kid trap w/very attractive display of gelato & as many samples as you want. But location of payment is so congested & they will not give you an empty cup to share any gelato like b/w my 3 & 6 yr olds so they could split the $6.25 cup of the same flavor they wanted. So ridiculous! And we had bought 2 smalls and a medium so it wasn't like we hadn't spent much there already. The gelato was just ok."}
{"text":"2 Drinks $51.89 in a mall at a Kiosk, real rip off and prices not posted! Drinks loaded with ice and service is poor. Over all go 10 more feet to the bar inside the chocolate cafe for a drink. Unbelievable.. BEWARE of this kiosk!!!"}
{"text":"Perfectly located in the middle of the forum shops... tried gelato and sorbet, various flavors and they were all delicious, they also have hotdogs, pizza, nachos, beer, and a bar with plenty of drinks. Didn't try any of that but it looked like people were really enjoying their food. Will probably  be good for a short and not that expensive lunch stop (compared to a restaurant). Will try to stop by again if there's a chance."}
{"text":"Expensive place located within a busy mall location. What caught my eyes were the gelato and the various of flavors you are able to try with free samples. There is limited seating but you can grab and go. They also have fast food such as pizza, nachos, and hot dogs.  Gelato is probably the reasons why most people stop by. The best deal is the $9.99 three scoop in a plastic colorful cup you can keep. The gelato is pretty good and flavorful for a simple treat. They have lots of choices to choose from such as fruity flavors to chocolates.   The food items are pretty pricey. Hotdogs are long but for about $10 I would rather get something else. Its not even anything special. They also serve alcoholic beverages as well for an average vegas price.   Yes, it is Las Vegas and you can expect some higher pricing and some food that are less than average. If you were to come here I would definitely try out the gelato for some smooth Italian ice cream."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good gelato. It's not the cheapest but this is Vegas, and you're in the Forum Shops. Expect to pay a lot in food generally speaking.  I've tried a couple of flavors and all of them have been tasty. My favorite one in particular is the mango one, but cookies and cream and hazelnut are good too.  My parents really like getting gelato from this place. My dad isn't even a big sweets guy so you know it's a big deal if he likes some dessert place."}
{"text":"It is located in Caesars Forum Shops on top of the floor , right across H& M store, Its sort of a open Gourmet Gelato Bar. It was bit pricey ,so we know It's Vegas. I bought the VIP which was still a bargain at $10 (as i was hungry) since small cup was round about $7. I ordered Vanilla Almond Fudge, Mint Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Chocolate Chunk.  The Girl at Gelato Counter was good and receptive in letting me sample almost all flavors like Banana Cheesecake , Mascrapone Caramel Pistachio Nut, Italian Tiramisu, White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake, Oreos Cookies and Cream.,Chocolate Mouse Truffle, Overall i found the yummy flavors to be the one's i ordered and rest one's i sample were too bland to have. Also on the other side was Pizza and Hot Dogs. Also they had bar section where bartender served the drinks.They have a a seating area where you can take a break and chill out and eat at the same time. Its usually busy however not really overcrowded.  VIP Gourmet Gelato with free topping of cream and biscuit on top of the scoops. Its a sweet treat. Try it not that bad at all, however bit pricey."}
{"text":"Nice fresh and refreshing sorbet. Premium price however.   Good service and a cozy seat down area to rest from the sun and wearing out of your legs in the endless Vegas hikes!"}
{"text":"Gelato flavour (tiramisu) was good mango sorbet was ok. The bad thing is that smallest one is 6.99. Also they are anal about requesting ID with credit card for a freakin gelato mean old lady at the cashier had me even take my ID off the wallet. And they don't offer any glass of watet"}
{"text":"This is located in the Forum Shops in a middle stand, so you can't miss it. I come here only for the gelato. The large is their best deal so I suggest getting that and sharing with someone. Every time I've come, they've been more than happy to let me taste as many flavors as I wanted with no rush.  My favorite flavor is the pistachio because it's really strong AND there's chunks of pistachio in the gelato as well. Always creamy and smooth. Love the wafer they top it with as well. Great treat to cool you down on a hot Vegas day :)"}
{"text":"Ate here after a few hours of shopping at the Forum Shops, we had a Pepperoni Gondola and waffle fries - both were good, but I'm pretty sure it was all pre-made stuff that they reheat or something.  The pizza was tasty and the cheese was especially good and gooey! the waffle fries were super hot, but still good.   the only thing that sucked was the seating area. they squish about 20 tables into a small space where 15 would be comfortable. I mean, you're practically sitting back to back with the person in back of you! it's understandable though, because it does get busy at lunch time and they want to accommodate as much people as possible. Luckily we came right after the big rush!"}
{"text":"Craving gelato while walking through the forum shop? Heed my words, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR GELATO. Their smallest size costs $6.99! Talk about over-priced. One worker kept pressuring my friend to go the next size up in order to get 2 flavors. Apparently they dont allow you to mix 2 flavors with the smallest cup. And the cup is pretty freaking small for seven bucks!   I got strawberry sorbet. It was apparent to me right off the bat that my sorbet was not fresh. It must have melted and been refrozen or something because there were so many ice crystals in my sorbet! And I paid $7 bucks for this crap! My friend got the tiramisu, and that one was actually pretty good, I'll say. But it still isnt worth $7. Definitely go somewhere else for similar tasting gelato for a better price. Total bogus."}
{"text":"Service was retched. Their selection wasn't that wide and it's located in the walkway of ceasars palace, which was clever, if not for the insurmountable people traffic. I asked for mint chocolate and they gave me pistachio. There was no refund but there should have been. They eventually changed it but with no apologies & I still had to wait in line to get it done. The Gelato tasted ok but wasn't worth the price!  There is this short moody Latina chic with glasses who was giving everybody attitude & killed the vibe. If you don't wanna work there, please don't. I kindly asked her to change it and she directed me to the other side but first saying, \"are you sure it was us?\" She wasn't even helping anyone & was evidently too busy giving ppl the stink-eye to work. She had the woman next to her cleaning up. It's in everyone's best interest to fire her, including hers."}
{"text":"These gelato bars are probably present in every other casino but this particular place is located inside the Venetian and they have a crazy variety of flavors. We wanted to try the best they offer and that was the one they displayed. It is a big cup of three layers of White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake, Chocolate Truffle Mousse, and Italian Pistachio Supreme. The cup looked so indulging but the flavors were so-so. I paid $10 for that cup. Wasn't really worth the money."}
{"text":"Good gelato here, located in the middle of the mall, and they hiked up prices to match the stores prices. They also offer foods like hot dogs and pizza but we didn't have any of that."}
{"text":"Martha played us real hard. I asked how much their daiquiris were and she said $10 so I purchased two and it all came out to $100. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Would not go back.  Ordered two Bloody Mary's which were ok...not great.  Very pricey--at $40 for the two with tip.  When the waitress brought them to our table, I asked if I could get a glass of ice water.  She said no.  They are not allowed to give out water (even though they have a tap, ice, and glasses!  They can only sell a big bottle of evian water to me.  Really?  A paying customer can't get a drink of water at your establishment?  WTF."}
{"text":"This is a cool little cafe to get a quick bite to eat. The ice cream bar is great.  The server here is very friendly and the environment was nice. I'm glad I can in to this place. Their gelato taste amazing!"}
{"text":"The best gelato I've ever had. Worth every penny  The drinks were great and the service was fantastic. I almost filled up on the gelato samples"}
{"text":"Ciao Ciao Cafe & Bar is located in the middle of the Forum Shops, right in front of the three story H&M. I was craving some ice cream and happened to stumble upon this place. The ice cream was decent, it fulfilled my craving but it was just okay.  The value is a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I was craving chocolate and I approached the counter and this young man was showing me the cups and the prices attached to the cups and how my best deal was to get the three scoop $9.99 sundae...I got two scoops of the double chocolate truffle and one scoop of the mint chocolate chip gelato and it was so yummy.   Thanks again for the late night"}
{"text":"Located inside the forum shops across from H&M store. Great place but it was busy and noisy (from the music at H&M) but mostly busy for food orders (Pizza, hotdogs)  Service was great, the server went out of her way to recommend some great combinations of gelato.  We had pistachio and a hazelnut carmel.  Kids had chocolate. We didn't sit down, we walked around with our cups making everyone stare at our wonderful treat and they were yummy!"}
{"text":"this place is located right across from FAO Shwartz. I order a gelato and I don't see the prices until I get to the register.  um. $7.99 for a small ass gelato.  sorry but i think paying $3.50 for gelato in LA is expensive.   Oh, don't worry though. you can get the Giant one for $45.  $45 gelato. STUPID."}
{"text":"So expensive!!! I regret going there last year, I was just looking for something to snack on. I got nachos and a bottle of water for $14. I mean its Vegas, but I could find somewhere else here for half that price. Oh well...."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would! First, it's not about the ice cream. I'm pretty sure it was great, BUT the customer service? We received the worst customer service EVER! Not only did one of the workers named Karen, who is in gelato sales, call us sucky, but she tried to curse my 16 year old brother and cousin out for saying that she had poor customer service. What is up with that? As we called the manager to explain how we were treated, Karen proceeded to try and curse at us from behind the counter. The \"manager\" if you can call him that (name Jack), didn't do much of anything. Jack didn't even offer us a refund for the manner in which his employee was acting and made us lose our appetite. Jack also gave us a non working number to the corporate office. I must say that this was the WORST customer service I have EVER experienced and I will NEVER contribute to this shop in any way, shape, or form, by spending money if Jack and Karen continue to be apart of that staff. Customer service is supposed to be about the customer and the customer experience. All my little brother wanted was some ice cream after he won his game. Sucky customer service!"}
{"text":"Nothing special other than the convenience of having gelato while you're shopping here at the Forum Shops.  Not only is it expectingly expensive (one scoop $6.49), but incredibly jam-packed if you're walking straight through it, crowded a heck.  But good fast service.    After the so-so experience at Gordon Ramsay's Pub, the vanilla was a bonus.  VIP definitely the better deal at $10, for 3 scoops."}
{"text":"This place is insanely expensive - $8.65 for a small cup of two types of gelato.  I don't recommend it.  Also, the workers are pushy and rude.  It's like a movie popcorn stand in the middle of the Forum Shops.  The pistachio gelato had real pistachios in it and the mint chocolate gelato were good but it was severely overpriced."}
{"text":"Located in the Forum Shops near H&M in the middle of the shopping area.  There were a cluster of mini serve areas for a bar with mixed drinks, a hot dog/snack spot, and this little counter serving gelato.  We stopped by for a quick sweet snack!   Our server was nice at first, but then quickly became impatient because we couldn't decide on the flavors we wanted.  This was our first visit EVER and so we needed to sample a few.  I was thinking, \"chill Lady, chill!\"  We love gelato and so we ordered the triple stack of flavors: coconut, pistachio, and Tahitian vanilla to share topped with whip cream!  It didn't last us very long but we certainly enjoyed it and for the price of $9, it was okay but a good amount.  Surprisingly what I loved most was the little biscuit or sweet cracker that came on top. It was the best thing ever! It took me back when I was living in Europe for just a moment, which allowed me to forget how impatient our service was.  All in all, a small spot for quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly when you ask for gelato samples, they'll give you more than what you ask for! First time I didn't feel guilty asking to sample every flavor. *2 BIG THUMBS UP*  They have a good balance of stable and creative flavors. Some stable flavors include vanilla, pistachio, strawberry sorbet and mango sorbet. Some creative flavors were banana foster cheesecake, mascarpone caramel with pistachios (drool!!!), and strawberry with chocolate chips.   A big thumbs down for the price. $6.99 for a small cup (equivalent to a single scoop elsewhere). They're also a little stingy with how much they give you too (I guess this makes up for the unlimited samples). They don't give you any more than the cup's height. I watched them scoop away the ice cream to flatten out to the top of the cup. Bummer :("}
{"text":"This place is the worst place. They had a phone outlet and the whole time they gave me dirty glares."}
{"text":"This may sound silly, but in the 2 nights I was in Vegas I got overcharged THREE TIMES with false tips. It started here at Ciao Ciao. First of all, the water I purchased here was already $4.99, but when I got home I saw that the woman at the register must have added $1 to the tip line, which means I paid $5.99 for a bottle of water. As a former server, I always give at least a 20% tip on meals or a $1 per alcoholic drink, but never a $1 tip for a water I buy at a stand! I frequent Vegas several times a year and I will NEVER go back here. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Ugh."}
{"text":"When I was shopping at the Forum I happened to walk by the Ciao Ciao Cafe and Bar. The gelato and sorbet started calling my name. I couldn't help myself and just had to stop by for a try. They have 14 flavors to choose from which seemed a little overwhelming for me. The girl behind the counter kept giving me samples until I finally decided on the tiramasu and mint chocolate chip (great combo by the way).   When it came to ordering the cashier really didn't give me any options on size but just asked me if I wanted 2 scoops ($7.99). Prices vary from $6.25 for a single scoop to $12.99 for their so called terminator. They claim to have the \"best\" and \"finest\" ingredients so for an occasional treat it's fun to experiment with all the flavors."}
{"text":"This place has a great location and of course it's hard to say no to yummy ice cream. I really like Jean Phillipe in Aria and Bellagio but this ice cream also not bad. However is pricey compare to what I used to get in Aria. I don't recommend pizzas, hotdogs and sodas because I'm not into junk food but we took sample ice cream with pistachio flavor which was good and dense."}
{"text":"Ice cream was amazing and totally worth it to try! The ice cream portions were decent size...and location is perfect ... Can't miss it!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad gelato/sherbet spot. They are generous with samples, but only up to three tries - if you dare to ask for more, be ready for a look :))  They had a very interesting mix of flavors, like Nutella with hazelnuts, Oreo, snickers, etc. Get a sampler for $6.99 - it's big enough."}
{"text":"Ciao ciao ice cream at Caesars palace las vegas. a small single scoop ice cream for about almost  $9. nothing really special."}
{"text":"Best michelada I have EVER had!!  I get one every time I come to Vegas! So worth the $20, and the bartenders are always awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped with a group of 7-10 people and Jill was amazing!!! Bloody Mary's were awesome... It's a must go place here in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This is a kiosk in the middle of the Forum Shops at Cesar's.  We got enticed to try the chocolate flavors (you can have three different flavors in one cone). I also wanted some coffee, so why not?  Good: The ice cream was very good The coffee was good too.  Bad: Prices are very high, $10 for three small balls of ice cream in a plastic cone Very hard to get a table, place is very small  If the prices were lower and the ice cream portion bigger, I could give this place a 4 star rating, but unfortunately prices are at tourist trap level (like most things in Vegas),   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dessert after dinner and got the VIP of 3 flavors:  Tahitian vanilla, cookies and cream, and mango gelato.   The vanilla was awesome, the other 2 flavors were meh.  Think cost was $8, a little pricey but I guess touristy considering the heart of the Forum Shops."}
{"text":"You'll find Ciao Ciao Cafe & Bar just off H&M in the Forum shops. It's a cool place and really convenient for you to sit back, kick it and take a break from shopping. We had a drink there and the bartender was very nice and friendly. I had a straight up G&T but, from what she said, they've got pretty much a full bar and are able to make you what you want so that's really cool.  My mate had a I can't remember which (that's not the name by the way!) cocktail and he said it was pretty. They also offer pizzas, hotdogs and a broad selection of Gelatos, which look so good + for those of you who've been to Sin City, remember those big/tall different coloured drink bottles? You can get one of them there as well. I'm definitely getting me on next time!"}
{"text":"Lots of gelato and sorbet options. Decently price and I felt like it was fairly close to authentic. A lot more authentic than other places in Vegas that claim to have real gelato. Split a VIP size (3 flavors) with my husband for $10."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Skip it. Go outside. Something else. Ordered two plain dogs and it took over 10 minutes while these guys stood around laughing and cutting up. Two plain hot dogs. Two buns, two pieces of meat. 7 people working. No one else up there ordering.   I want to write a longer review, but, I mean, really?!"}
{"text":"My cousin said this place has the best micheladas he's ever had. Even better than ones back in LA and even better than the one's his friends have had in Mexico. His words, not mine. He swears by it and since we were in the area having spent some time at NikeTown, we thought we'd check it out.   First of all, I thought this place only sold gelato, pizza slices and alcoholic smoothies by the yard. You know, typical Vegas things. There wasnt even a sign for micheladas so we had to ask the nice latina lady at the counter if they made it. Sure enough they did and she said it's one of their best sellers. Why isnt there a sign for it?? That was interesting.  The michelada was a hit. Dos Equis beer was chosen and i heard it was as delicious as advertised by my cousin. Who would have thought? At the Forum Shops of all places... So when walking around and thirsty for a refresher, know that the gelato place by the huge H&M store that people just walk through usually, makes killer micheladas. It's a proven fact."}
{"text":"We wanted a quick lunch, and decided to stop here. Good lord, it was expensive and crappy. The reheated slice of pizza was almost $8, and the plain hotdogs were $7. Belch. And the tables were so close together, it was impossible to move. Just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Server was too pushy to get the big size for the gelato, when we asked for a flavor to try, they mixed it with another because that's their popular combination. It took 10 minutes to be able to pay, the Gelato was starting to melt already. Then we asked for tap water and they told us that they couldn't offer us that, but bottled. Gelato was so, so. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"RIPOFF!! 7$ Foot long hotdog sounds ok when you are in vegas. BUT. I've asked for topings. Diced onion 1.5$ jalapeño 1.5$ chilly 1.5$ cheese 1.5$ everything 1.5$ That hotdog cost me 13$ !!!!!! WHAT!!!! ARE YOU CRAZY???? IT'S A TRAP!!!! You'll find yourself with the receipt in your hand and totally chocked.  Thank god we have YELP!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing too special for me. Overpriced drinks (well, it's in Vegas so...) and incredibly long wait on hot afternoons. But it's in a relatively good location in the middle of the Forum Shops so I see how it's very accessible for people."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since 2009, but what I do remember is that a lot of items do not have prices on them.  We have all seen workers like the ones they got here. They hate working, they hate their jobs, and they don't have a high regard for customers. When the cashier girl finally decides to get off her lazy ass and slowly walk towards the cash register, she will usually ring up a total that you might believe to be a practical joke. For some reason, there doesn't seem to be anything here that is under $15.   The Gelato here is horribly overpriced and horribly overrated. You can walk across the street to the Venetian and get gelato there that tastes better and costs 1/4th the price. Even the gelato they have at the Costco in Summerlin tastes better than this overrated sludge, and it only costs $1.50 over there."}
{"text":"We were having such a great weekend in Vegas, until our visit here.   1st of all, being this is Vegas, (inside of Caesars) things are going to cost slightly more.. Knowing that I was okay with paying a little more for a caramel latte. I figured, up to $7 tops for coffee is okay.  She asked if i want it cold or hot. I said, cold... but want the ice blended. No problem!   My husband gave me the receipt right before we got our coffee. When i looked to see they charged us almost $21.00 ($20.52 to be exact) for two coffees.  I almost lost it!  How the heck is that possible?  I saw on the receipt \"Blended (2 @ $1.50)  total $3.00.  So I questioned the cashier. She said they charge an extra  fee to blend their coffee. Really? Why?   To top it off... the coffee tasted nasty! It was washed down. I tasted mostly crushed ice, with some coffee.   Starbucks doesn't even charge more then $5.00 for their fancy coffee. How ridiculous is it to pay over $10.00 for disgusting coffee!!   Very disappointed!"}
