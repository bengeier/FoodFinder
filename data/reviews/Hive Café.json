{"text":"Good 70% organic food for decent price. Vegan options available. The place big but always swarmed by students."}
{"text":"Got the worst bout of food poisoning ever from their Loyola location. I was barely conscious and puked non stop for hours, and eventually had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. When I got there, I couldn't even give my information because I couldn't stop puking for long enough to tell them. Eventually fainted and found some relief after more than a few IV drips.
Can't remembered what I ordered, but it was a tomato-y soup type thing with some kinda pasta salad, was less than mediocre but ate it anyways cause it was kinda pricey, and it was the only restaurant in close proximity that I could grab something from.
 
I also found it to be understaffed, and consequently, the service was ridiculously slow.

It gets one star & that's only because the staff I've encountered there was super nice."}
{"text":"Hive cafe is just one of those dirt cheap vegan food joints that try to enforce a non-existent oppression concept of austerity fabricated by an authoritarian self-entitled liberal hive-mind extremely vocal minority. It is a cafe that employs atrociously inefficient and lazy students sporting typical hipster-like apparel. The kind of place you try to avoid unless you practically live in a cardboard box.

The staff seems to be composed of every kind of individual unable to keep a job. This is easily demonstrated by their complete inability to serve a meal under 10 minutes resulting in absolutely atrocious line-ups (up to 40-50 minutes). Also, obviously, the staff is too amazing and great to wear hair nets. They seem to sometimes put on a cap that is apparently, from observation, very optional. One girl behind the counter was even dressed in a tank top proudly displaying armpit hair that would put Chewbacca to shame.

Admittedly, the food is cheap... which is uniquely due to the portions being very small and the place being partially paid with our student fees.

My friend wanted to share food from there once, I nearly barfed out the hot chocolate he got from there. I didn't know anyone could possibly make hot chocolate that tastes worse than Tim Horton's. I had to make him swear he didn't pee in it. I won't even try to describe the salad.

Very hipster-like atmosphere, don't forget your beanies, your macbooks and your iphones to be part of the mass!

2/5 for cheap food... even if it tastes like an old cardboard box that was left under the Californian sun for a good 2 weeks.

Edit: I was just told by a friend of mine that she was HOSPITALIZED after ingesting their macaroni salad. As such, this review just lost 2/5 and went back to 1/5. Don't risk it."}
{"text":"Je mourrais d'envie d'un grilled cheese, je me suis arrêtée au Hive avant mon atelier de Kokedama à la Greenhouse. D.e.l.i.c.i.e.u.x. Quoi de mieux que d'être servie avec le sourire, cela fait toujours du bien au moral et aux zygomatiquex. Ce petit café est tellement bien situé dans Concordia!  Cela me donnerait presque envie de redonner de retourner à l'école, juste pour avoir mon petit café dans mon université. ahahah."}
{"text":"I always stop here when I want a quick snack. They have amazing pastries and sandwiches. The breakfast burrito, the grilled cheese, and the cheese and ham croissant are the best. And it's all vegan/vegetarian. 

The staff has always been nice to me and the service adequate."}
