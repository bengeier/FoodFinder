{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and this is my take out/fast food \"fix\". It is definitely better than MacD. Ok, seriously, the food tastes really good. I usually get chicken take out combo. Half or quarter with white rice, fries and salad. Salad is always fresh- lettuce with onions, tomatoes and olives. Rice is white rice with peas occasionally and always well cooked. Fries are good too. Not too crispy and I like it that way. Chicken is always nicely done. Very tasty. I don't know what they put in it but it's good! Ive been to this place many times and over the past year or so and unfortunately the sizes have gotten smaller. Their prices are good however, they have gone up. Pricing is a big issues I have with this place. I used to see a special advertised outside, walk in and see different price written on the menu board for the same thing and get charged 3rd, usually highest, price (Their prices for chicken combo takeout are in $9-13 range). I have experienced price discrepancies at this place probably over half a dozen times. Also, different staff would charge me different prices for the same thing. So much that I have stopped going for a while. I'm back to going there occasionally. I call it my crack place- all the white rice and fries can leave me feeling comatosed a bit but I can't help myself from stopping lol. Also, chicken is done very nicely. And I practically live across the street so it's hard to resist. Another thing service wise, it happened to me several times that I would get soft drink with the take out, get home and realized that it was not in the package. Or I ask for straw or plastic cutlery and they forget to put it in. It should be automatically added to the takeout package. So, overall food is okay but the service is lacking. Please train your staff properly and get the logistical side more organized, you have been in business long enough to have these under your belt!"}

{"text":"Great grilled specialties. Meals are simple and delicious with a wide variety of meats and fish to choose from. Doesn't get better in terms of casual portuguese cuisine."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé une poitrine de poulet, frites salade et crème caramel pour dessert. 20.60$ Un peu cher mais ca semble être le même prix partout  Arrivé tiède, une heure après la commande. Les portions sont généreuses mais j'ai déjà trouvé meilleur poulet portugais ailleurs.  Pas mauvais mais pas le gros coup de foudre non plus. J'ai essayé, j'ai yelpé."}
{"text":"We were 18 for diner on a friday night. Food is excellent, choice is unique. Sea food, especially the octopus, are beautifully done. The place is small and cozy. Service was difficult for this large group but very friendly."}
{"text":"All portuguese flavors in one single dish! This is how it felt when I tried their grilled Calamari plate yesterday. You know when all the sauces eventually get mixed in the bottom of the plate. it could be a deal breaker...but nope, this plate was so flavorful and the synergy of the flavors works so well it was one of the most delectable restaurant dish I had in a while. The fries were also cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of seasoning.   Staff super friendly.  The restaurant looks like nothing from outside but it all happens with your taste buds!  ---  Toutes les saveurs portugaises en un seul plat! Voilà ce que j'ai expérimenté lorsque j'ai essayé leur plat de Calmars grillés hier. Lorsque toutes les sauces se mêlent dans le fond d'un plat, ça peut passer ou casser...et bien pas avec ce plat qui était rempli de saveurs et où la synergie des aliments travaille à merveille. C'était l'un des meilleurs mets de restaurant que j'ai consommé depuis des semaines! Les frites étaient aussi cuites et assaisonnées à la perfection.  Employés très sympathiques  Un restaurant qui n'a l'air de rien de l'extérieur mais qui se vend au travers de vos papilles allumées!"}
{"text":"Un endroit à double tranchant... Soit qu'on est vraiment déçu ou soit qu'on est vraiment satisfait. Nous y allons souvent la semaine et c'est plutôt calme. Les portions sont généreuses et la nourriture est bonne. Par contre, suffit d'y aller la fin de semaine avec un grand groupe pour que la qualité du service baisse. Plusieurs oublies dans les commandes et c'est très long!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, portion size is generous and the price is right. They also have good service.   This place was very welcoming and did me for two dinners on my short stay in Montreal.   Come eat here. That is all."}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant! Service was really good and the chicken was really tasty. I also tried the burger and it was quite good! Big portions and good service. Worth the try! Important tip they only take cash but have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Come in, find a table or sit in the outside seating area. Excellent, helpful customer service. Restrooms located in the back. You won't be disappointed in any of the meat selections. I'm personally a fan of the potatoes and I WILL be returning for the little custard pies! Unfortunately I can't remember the name, but I posted a picture."}
{"text":"The paella was delicious with very generous amounts of seafood. The rice was tasty and plentiful. We bought custard tarts  to eat later..amazing. What a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Waitress is amazing, beautiful and funny. Chicken is as hot as the cook. They make a great team and therefor a super ambiance. Will keep on recommending this place to everyone i meet in the street."}
{"text":"Accueil dynamique et chaleureux, un bon service, un cadre sympathique. On a pris un poulet entier avec des frites. Les frites étaient trop bonnes mais le poulet était tellement maigre. On a eu des doutes que ce n'était qu'un poussin ! Le volume du poulet a tout gâché malheureusement sinon j ai pu dire que c est une adresse à retenir!"}
