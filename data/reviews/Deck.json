{"text":"Stopped in on Thursday for a beer...4.50 for a tall Stella?  Already like the place..then. Ordered wings.  45 cents on Thursday...outstanding...our first dozen cooked perfectly...we like them extra extra extra crispy and they did it perfect..we got hot...ordered more and asked them to spice it up...they chopped up jalapeños and tossed them in the hot sauce with the wings...Wow!  Exceptional...really...Lulu the bartender paid more attention to us after our first round and by the time we left she had us laughing...Lisa the manager checked on our meal and was informative as to other specials in a brief professional visit...for a hillbilly bar in the hills the place is aces...recommend it for a cold beer and wings any day!  We left a bit glassy eyed but they had 4 or 5 tables filled...I plan on stopping with the family to try it under a different perspective.."}
{"text":"If you are trying to pick between somewhere else and here, try the somewhere else first. Not bad for what's around, which is not saying much. I work very close to here and have given them a ton of chances to impress and they always find a way to disappoint. Whether its extremely slow service, or screwing up orders, to watered down liquor, it's ALWAYS something. At least when it was the old owners, the meals didn't take 45 minutes to get, on a slow day. Sure, the old owners had their favorite bar patrons that they took care of first before you, but at least you would get your meal and drinks in a reasonable manner. Three times, when the food order was incorrect, the best I got was a \"Sorry\" as they walked away from the table. If you want proof, please visit. Otherwise, heed my review, there ARE WAY BETTER out there. McDonald's is better than here, if only they served alcohol."}
