{"text":"Pizza is good, but pricey. High quality ingredients and very fresh!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try WOP for sometime and finally convinced my buddy (I'll call him \"Steve\" for this review because he doesn't like his real name being used in my reviews, but it is Jeff), so we headed down to Inglewood for lunch. With Out Papers is on the second floor, so you will be looking for a door at street level. Climb the stairs into an open kitchen and dining area with windows overlooking 9th Ave.   We were greeted and seated by the hostess. Our server was very quick to bring water and menus. She gave us a quick run down of the menu and took our drink order.  \"Steve\" and I were both impressed by the appearance and ambiance of the dining room, which was about half full. We were entertained by the projected Pink Panther cartoons while we waited.  The server brought our drinks; \"Steve\" had a Wild Rose brewed Wraspberry and I had a Mill St Organic Lager. No standard brews here. Good craft beer only. After a little more chat about the menu, we ordered two pizzas: the Hutch and the Wild Hog. According to the server, the Hutch is a spicy favourite. She was also kind to inform us that the Wild Hog had broccoli. I hesitated on this note, but she described how the broccoli is saut√©ed with garlic. Sold!!  I should mention that there are other selections on the menu that are not pizza, but I didn't really care because I was there for pizza. Anyway, the chalkboards above the kitchen list drink and food specials. They have a nice selection of wines as well. Also, pizzas come in one size which is equivalent to a 12 inch.  Pizzas arrived quickly. Hot. Fresh. First bites delicious! I liked  the presentation of pepper flakes, parm, and fresh basil on a dish instead of the standard shakers. \"Steve\" and I managed to stuff all but one slice of each into our bellies. Each pizza provided a pleasant variety of flavours. Excellent!  I can hardly wait to bring my Dining Babe here. I am sure she will love it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. Thank you guys for having gluten free options including Bard's Beer! So damn tasty. I've never had a bad time, nor bad service and I love the neighbourhood of Inglewood. Besides the food, I think it's super awesome that you're playing old films that are family friendly (most of the time - Rocky Horror was a little too much for my 4 year old on Halloween but what the heck was a 4 year old doing there on Halloween anyway?) ;)"}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of life I'd have if I became an \"elite reviewer\" on yelp, but as a regular customer with no grandiose ideas of self importance, the atmosphere is refreshing, the pizza is addictive, and the staff and ownership are friendly.   I always order the Hawaiian. They always stuff my face with the finest and I appreciate that. Anyone picking on this place probably resents having to walk up a flight of stairs."}
{"text":"I stopped into this sure-to be-neighbourhood-gem last week.   I LOVED The HANDCRAFTED traditional and new world pizza complemented by  (I am happy to see) - a great selection of affordable wines and beers.  The place was busy with a good vibe Food - superb Try the meatball appetizer - YUM"}
{"text":"Buon Appetito - Princess Bride, The Afro Diva, and I hit this Inglewood designo pizza palace. We really enjoyed the Shaved Fennel Salad, the sliced pear was a nice complement to the rest of this light ruffage. As for the wheels: Parma, arugula was a nice touch; Hawaiian 5-0, beware of the jalapenos, they were Texas asphalt hot; Hog Wild, sausage always a great disc topping, didn't really taste the roasted garlic. The crusts were nice, but a little short on the sauce. Upstairs locale lends a cool vibe. Good and innovative eats, but a touch pricey."}
{"text":"Oh sooo good! Love the upstairs atmosphere and the food is delicious.  Great place to try if you're stopping by Inglewood!  So far I've had the Garden Calzone and Garden Pizza - both delicious, no meat and amazing taste.  The others I was with tried a number of other pizzas and between us we've had all of the Calzones - must say every single thing was delicious.  Not sure that this will help you decide what to have, but I would encourage you to try a number of things!"}
{"text":"The first time i went, the food was very good. My gf and I shared a Baby Doll pizza, and two appetizers; the warmed olives and the pear/fennel salad. The olives were a great mix of flavours, and the salad was fine as well. The Baby Doll pizza was absolutely amazing, and not too heavy. The crust, to me, is slightly chewy, which I prefer, and not too thick.  The second time I went, we did the same, shared a Hutch pizza - very bland, and the crust was burned on half of the pizza. We shared the pork and beef meatballs. When the server came out she remarked 'lucky you, extra meatballs', but when we tasted them they were just ones that had been leftovers or didn't turn out well, because i found them dry and not very flavourful. The bococcini and tomatoe salad was SO SMALL. I mean like one bite each - and we were charged $12. That was very disappointing, as the one bite each we got was tasty..  Now, on to the service. Both times I entered the restaurant, my friends and I were greeted in a friendly manner, and asked if we wanted drinks while we waited. So far so good...then we get to the table... Both times I have had the same server. She was one of the rudest I have had in a long time. So much so that the girls eating next to us - the second time I went - asked us if we noticed that the server was as awful to us as she was to them. In fact, she said under her breath when the server left, 'excuse me for trying to eat at your restaurant and trying to drink teh alcohol on your menu' (This lady tried to order 4 types of liquor and was told each time they were out). We all discussed how she was abrupt, in a rush and never came back to check on us. I don't know what her problem is, but she should not be in customer service.  I think I'll be going to Double Zero then back to Una first before I even consider this place again."}
{"text":"I was on disaster relief duty with The Calgary Highlanders on June 22nd, helping move sandbags from a flatbed truck into a front-end loader in anticipation of throwing them in the river to stop the houses on 8th Avenue from falling into the Bow River, when some crazy dude on a Peter-Parker like scooter came riding up. Free pizzas from somewhere. Our platoon of 30 Highlanders gratefully accepted the manna and went back to work.  Then the guy came back. This time with some Indian food in addition to six more pizzas - the capacity of the little carrier on the back of the scooter.  By now we had finished moving the 125,000 pounds of sandbags or whatever it was, and the platoon commander was ordering us to the river bank to move the sandbags from where the front-end loader had dumped them, into the bucket of an excavator. Turns out the Bow River, which was like 6 feet higher than normal or something, had torn away about 100 feet of shoreline, and was still eroding the bank because of the volume and speed of the current. The City of Calgary engineers were using heavy equipment to dump Jersey barriers into the river, and our sandbags were going in next, all in an attempt to slow the flow, and save the houses that were now just 40 feet or so from extinction on the unstable bank.  And here comes the pizza guy with another round of pizza, and Indian tacos.  A long story short (you can read the long story at calgaryhighlanders.com), the City Engineers saved the day (with the help of a few good Highlanders), and just as we were mounting the trucks to go riding off into the sunset (literally) - damned if that guy on the scooter didn't zip past with another load of pizzas and tacos.  The tacos were really quite good - I've never tried this variety - and my platoon mates all thought the pizza was great - nothing fancy, just honest-to-goodness, old fashioned ingredients.  Like some of the other reviews I just glanced at, I have to admit, I am a bit amazed at the name, as I certainly know what \"without papers\" means and saw fistfights break out in high school over the use of the abbreviation of that term.  The generosity was greatly appreciated, and the quality of the food seemed good, though admittedly, we had been eating army rations for 24 hours and our breakfast had consisted of mystery meat sandwiches and Doritos. I guess the caterer didn't know how to make bacon and eggs. But I digress.   Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We walked into Without Papers and were directed to sit wherever there was space. It took a little while for the waitress to come ask us what we wanted to drink. That was fine. But we had a question about the menu, because my companion is gluten free and dairy free. The waitress never came back for our order, she just passed by and said she had ordered the pizza we had questions about? Um... thanks? But we need it gluten free. And we want something more to eat. I then ordered the Margarita pizza.  The food was tasty, but our waitress forgot to bring cheese to our table. She brought the bill before we were done. They kept interrupting us to ask if we were done. Um...No! It wasn't like there were people waiting for tables on a Tuesday night. Then she kept coming by with the credit card machine. What the hell woman?? I think she either sensed we were annoyed or our joking about wanting something more led her to bring us free liquor. Fine, but UNA and Double Zero are both better."}
{"text":"Everyone who misses Italy, like I do, will have a piece of it in Without Papers. And for those who hasn't visited Italy yet - try and you will want to visit the country that inspired such a mastepiece! I also loved the potato salad and olives. But my friend had a Six Bean salad as an appetizer and that's what I am ordering next time. Every dish is flavourful and fresh!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant based on the Dinner with Julie blog. We went for take out. It was fast (10 minutes) for two pizzas and a salad. Pizzas were tasty, salad as good. My hubby thought the salad was too salty, but I though it was pretty good (Beet Salad). Excellent quality ingredients that remind me of Italy. Both kids enjoyed the four cheese pizza. We will return and may even try to eat in."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and  I have to say that the relatively uncomplicated menu, the relaxed atmosphere and the food make this spot a fine place to go. The pizza is all baked wonderfully in a tin-man inspired oven, and features some lovely authentically inspired ingredients. This was a fabulous place to bring our vegetarian friends as well, as their veggie pizzas are superb (I ended up having their mushroom pizza the last time we went).   If you are looking for a very traditional, minimally processed and very fresh pizza, and equivalently relaxed surroundings - Without Papers is fab. (And if you are looking for parking, there is a city lot just one 1/2 block away - seems to always be parking there!)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! Took our family here, had a wonderful time. The kitchen staff let our 7 year old make a tiny pizza, he was so happy! Really impressed, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing!  I'm not usually a fan of thin crust pizza (unless it's slightly crisp) because it's so easy for the slices to become soggy, but the pizza here is so flavourful.  I've found that their version of Hawaiian pizza can get soggy due to the pineapple involved, but their chicken pizza is AMAZING!  You can really taste the difference that free-range chicken makes.  They also serve ginger beer here, which is cool and hard to find in a restaurant sometimes in this city.  The location is great as the next nearest gourmet pizza place in the area would probably be UNA on 17th Avenue.  If you love pizza, you owe it to yourself to try a slice here at least once."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious, Blue Ox being my favourite pizzas from the menu. Would give it 5 stars but the service is lacking. The servers seem like they don't want to be there and are very rude.  If the service changed I would definitely make this my regular place to eat pizza."}
{"text":"Deklicious pizza.   My husband and I loved the recommendations of the staff.  Our two sons also loved the pizza they shared.  Delicious!!!.   They were Greta to the kids.  They changed the \"movie\" on the wall to be kid friendly.    A lovely experience.  Great staff."}
{"text":"As evidenced by the packed crowds here on the weekend, this pizza appeals to a lot of people. Alas, not me.  Pizza generally falls into one of two categories: 1) North American parlour style with a thick bready, crust and lots of savoury toppings, or 2) Neapolitan style with a toothsome, super thin crust and sparse gourmet toppings.  For me, WOP (am I allowed to write that?) is unsatistifyingly somewhere in between.  Let me paint the The Pizza Triptych for you:  Crust: The bottom crust is indeed very thin, and has some of the charred bits you expect from a super hot Neopolitan pizza oven.  The edge crust though is considerably more dense than expected, more like a traditional parlour style.  I'm guessing due to their choice of flour or their kneading technique, overall the crust lacks the signature slight elasticity of a Neopolitan style crust.    Sauce: The one deviation from Neopolitan style that I appreciate is the tomato sauce, which is less watery than the requisite San Marzano sauce used at other spots in town.  This wateriness is why I typically go for white pizza instead (usually based on a bechamel sauce).  This is where the menu gets a bit confusing: there are two pizzas without tomato sauce, but with \"roasted panna\".  I've never heard of roasted cream, so is this a sauce, or a daubed topping of some sort (like ricotta)?  Both were the priciest on the menu ($21) , and I was here for a quick lunch, so I didn't bother to ask.  Toppings: Despite the bready (albeit thin) parlour crust and sauce, WOP goes for the Neapolitan sparse cheese and gourmet toppings.  The toppings were tasty, but the net effect is a $19 pizza (the \"Salty Dog\") that didn't fill me up for lunch.  The bottom line is I'd rather go to a pizza parlour for a cheap filling slice, or a full fledged Neapolitan joint for a satisfying gourmet pie with white sauce."}
{"text":"Great food, service and ambiance!  Pizzas are excellent, they make their own ice cream in house and it is definitely worth the trip there.  All the desserts are excellent."}
{"text":"OMG, I was just re-reading the menu to prepare my review and I noticed they have free local delivery! Love this place even more!!! Delivery from Without Papers would be perfect for a night where you want yummy pizza but don't want to leave the couch :)   It has been a while since I've been to UNA, so I can't put together a good comparison, but I think Without Papers is as good as it gets! I am a big fan of the thin crust napoletana style pizzas. I'm not sure if WP is certified authentic napoletana, but frankly, I don't care. I like the variety of pizza toppings, lots of wine selection, and they serve grizzly paw sodas!   I went with three friends on a Saturday evening. We showed up around 6:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes for a 4 person table. No biggie, we were seated at the bar while we waited. From the bar we ordered the house marinated olives and a bottle of wine. Olives were a great snack. They are served warm, and there were 4 or 5 different types of olives and some pickled garlic. Once we sat down, I split the Parma pizza with a friend. It had prosciutto, parmesan, arugula, bocconcini and tomato sauce. It was amazing.   My only regret was eating a snack before going to the restaurant. I would have loved to try more pizzas. Next time I'm going to try the Hawaiian 5-0 pizza. Jalape√±os? Bring it on!! I might even treat myself to a Grizzly Paw ice cream float!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend raved about this restaurant so I was excited to try it out, as he stated it would deliver an authentic Italian pizza comparable to those I had in Napoli.  We arrived and the place was very noisy, and full of children. Our server was unhappy, and mumbling under her breath at us?! It was a very uncomfortable experience to say the least. The appetizers arrived after 40 minutes... for the buffalo mozzarella salad with tomatoes (literally 4 thin slices of cheese), and warm olives. It was all so overpriced it was outrageous. How does slicing cheese and tomatoes suffice 40 minutes? The olives were soaked in balsamic to the point they were mushy.  Over $20 for a small single pizza, and over $12 for simple tiny appetizers. The whole thing was just such a waste of money.   I thought after the food too so long that we would get some kind of compensation, but no. The grumpy server did manage to say \"well we are busy\".   DON\"T BOTHER! Overpriced place for what you get."}
{"text":"awesome!, great people, great service, very accommodating for large groups.  would recommend it for a large birthday, romantic/ private dinner, or a girls night out!"}
{"text":"We went into this restaurant exhausted and hot, after a failed attempt waiting at another restaurant. I am very glad that we found this place! They had great service, a lot of fans going to keep the place cool, a nice atmosphere, and I enjoyed being able to watch the kitchen (and The Life Aquatic!).   The pizza was nothing incredible and was quite pricey compared to other pizza places I have been to, but it was still pretty good. We also tried the Black Forest ice cream cake; the ice cream was decent but it would have been nice to have more of the chocolate crust at the bottom.  Overall, not the most amazing pizza  but still a great restaurant for a bite to eat and a nice drink."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time that I have been to Without Papers... I will never return.  The pizzas were ok, not fabulous. For what they're charging, the quality is inconsistent. The first time the pizza was considerably better; this time the sauce tasted like tomato paste out of the can...not fresh and too acidic.  What really bothered me and convinced me not to go back, however, was the movie content they play while the restaurant is FULL of families with young children.  The first time I went, it was late at night; this time I returned at the dinner hour with my son who is 14 (and has seen a lot of media by now)--but he was the one most vocal about how disturbing the movie was.  It's playing on every wall; the management was standing there at the front looking at the movie as well, and it's like they don't even notice or care what they're playing...  There were several families around us with children much younger than 14 and some under 5yrs.  The movie is Animatrix, and just because it is animated is no excuse for playing content with explicit sexuality, nudity, extreme violence, gore, and especially the scene which bothered us--a female \"robot\" being stripped & beaten by male soldiers while they laughed & taunted her.  My son's impression was, \"Wow this place is so messed up. Why did I have to eat my pizza while watching a rape scene?  I don't care if it's animated, that was really disturbing.\" There's a summary here of what I'm talking about:   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328832/parentalguide?ref_=tt_ql_7#certification  We won't be returning. Ever.  Plenty of pizza places with thin crust yumminess without thoughtless management forcing this type of garbage on paying customers. We Canadians are \"too nice.\"  I was tired and didn't want to make a \"scene\" so we just left and vowed to never return.  Hopefully getting the word out online will at least protect families with children from never setting foot in there.  I really hope the management cleans up their act!"}
{"text":"I would like to open with the fact that I am not a pizza person.  Pizza is never my first choice of food to have for any meal.  So when Without Papers opened in the space which Nectar Deserts used to be in, I was slightly curious but didn't really have any interest in visiting it.  For those who are not part of the Twittersphere, Without Papers has a deal every Monday to Thursday where their pizzas are half price between 9pm and 10pm (dine-in only).  Considering I find the prices here a little steep, I thought that would be a great time to try the place if I ever did.  Finally after months of 'it's kinda late now and I want to go to bed soon', the timing was finally right for my partner and I to meet with Without Papers.  My first impression was that the place was largely unchanged from it's Nectar days.  We were seated at the exact same table that we sat at our exclusive visit to Nectar before it shut it's doors.  There are two projectors showing videos on both side walls (a RHCP concert while we were there).  It was mildly lit which sets a pretty good atmosphere for a romantic evening (although candles on the table would have added to that).  I got a Parma and my partner got a Hog Wild.  The pizza's were a good size (too big for me to finish), thin crust and mine was delicious!  The tomato sauce with the prosciutto and arugula was really awesome.  The best part for me was the crust.  I usually leave the crust but this was tasty and crunchy, not too bready and really yummy.  I didn't enjoy my partner's Hog Wild as much as it was quite greasy but he enjoyed it.  I finished my meal with a decaf coffee which hit the spot and was really smooth.  We had the leftover pizza a day after and it was still delicious although the crust was obviously less crunchy.  Truthfully we will not visit this place and pay full price but if you are okay with the price point and looking for a delicious amazing pizza place to go to I highly recommend Without Papers.  As a non-pizza person, I am really happy that I tried it....and it might just be my favourite pizza place in Calgary.  :)"}
{"text":"The pizza was stellar. The server accommodated my son's request for cheese pizza with chicken. I had the hog wild and I've been dreaming about it ever since. It was divine.   Sadly, everything beside the pizza was lacking. The house made lemonade was very watered down, quite flavourless. The tiramisu was unremarkable and my cappuccino tasted like it was made from old beans.   Service was ok (but yes, staff often chatting in the corner). My son enjoyed the cartoons projected on the walls.   In the end: I'd order the pizza in a heartbeat but not a lot else."}
{"text":"The most authentic tasting pizza I've ever had outside of Italy. A must for pizza lovers. It's usually pretty busy at lunch, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Based on a take out order.  Service was pretty bad. The guy who took my CC wasn't friendly at all, and seemed annoyed to take my money. I'm happy to leave a small tip when I pick up food, but with the way I was treated I was not going to to give him any more money.   Pizza was okay. I like a good char on my pizza, especially on a thin crust. This was burnt. Sauce was decent, but nothing special.   Atmosphere seemed cool,  but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We went to WOP 3 days into it's opening and were fairly impressed. The pizza is well done and I echo the review on the meatball appetizer - very nice, but I think that the app menu overall could be a bit more inventive. I'm not sure if I am a fan of the movies being shown on the walls, but it didn't detract from my experience. I'm not a huge fan of high top tables and WOP is all high top. Again, not a deal breaker. Inglewood absoutely needed (needs) more places like this so WOP is a welcome addition. Looking forward to a bit more inspiration on the apps but otherwise, a winner."}
{"text":"The only reason for me giving this place three stars is because I'm not this high end. I'm a simple person who likes simple food, therefore give me your average Hawaiian or meat lovers pizza from whatever low end pizza place and I'm happy. I wouldn't say the pizza was bad per say, I guess I'm just too used to having my pizza loaded with your usual toppings.   So location: pretty decent, parking can be a bit difficult and you might have to pay but not bad all around, and they have a sign right above the stairs that leads to the place so at least you won't walk into the wrong store.   Setting: The area is pretty cramped. I would say this is a place that's for a party between 2-4, if you are with more friends then I wish you luck trying to find two tables together, otherwise sit at the booth that's by the kitchen (which is open so entertain yourself watching dough fly int the air) or around the stair bannister. The general vibe to the place is cool, low lighting, a video player where they silently play movies or live music, and I've got to give them huge props for playing Queen when we walked in.  Pizza: It's all the same size, which I believe is a small. Like I said, the pizza isn't my style, but I do give them 5 stars for uniqueness."}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced. The fact that they offer a reasonably priced corkage option of $15 per bottle is a draw.  The main issue here is with the service.  We had great engagement from the server initially and then things began to fall apart. We selected The Hutch pizza which is chock full of spicy italian meats so having a glass of cold water would have been huge.   Also, we sat beside a window and had the window shade pulled down a bit.  this was not due to the light but from the intense heat / greenhouse effect.  Well, one of the wait staff decided that she was in charge and without asking, pulled the blinds right up. We viewed that as quite rude and someone with a bit of decency would have asked if that was ok.  Bathrooms were small and one was out of order causing a queue.    I prefer the pizza crust at Pulcinella and Double 00 more and would probably choose one of those before revisiting Without Papers.  That being said, it does have a ton of potential and if they are able to address their service issues, they will be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"Its location is perfect because if there is no street parking you have the starbucks across the street to park in, jump out, run up the stairs and grab the order.  The pizzas were ready and the staff was very friendly. Got a fridge magnet out of it. We had a Sausage Party and white sauce pizza which were both fantastic. This is the go to place for us now because its not extremely busy like the place on 17th and 4th and you can call for pick up."}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza - definitely the best in the city! I was recently gone from Calgary for 6 months and literally dreamed about their Margherita pizza. I've been back 4 weeks and have already eaten it 3 times ....ok, ok, so I have a slight addiction ....! Try it and you'll see what I mean. The wood oven thin crust, topped with rich, hearty tomato sauce, underneath the just enough, but not a flat blanket of mozzarella cheese, and my fave part: the plentiful, fresh basil that is the crowning glory. I'd write more, but I gotta go get me my #4!!!"}
{"text":"We heard a lot of good comments about this place, so one day we decided to give it a try.  We ordered a caprese salad to start, and then a veggie pizza as our main. The salad was at our table within 5 minutes of placing our order, which was very impressive. Unfortunately, it was not the same for the pizza. It was a good 45 minutes until our pizza arrived.  The pizza itself was good, crust was thin and it was a good balance between the sauce, cheese and toppings. However, it was nothing spectacular - especially not for the time we waited for it. I must say I have had better pizza within the city limits (Pulcinella and Double Zero come to mind).  The service was good although on the slow side. However our server was very friendly and eager to give suggestions and such, so kudos for that. We might give it another try sometime in the future if we are in the area and craving pizza."}
{"text":"Still hovering between 3-4 stars in my opinion.  Been coming here almost 3 years and only seen 2 new pizzas on the menu....need to switch things up at least once, twice a year to keep regulars interested...it's a small menu to begin with so a few new appys and pizzas would be nice.  The Caesar salad was quite meh last time I went...lettuce had brown edges and they forgot the procuitto.  My visits to this little joint have been getting spaced farther and farther apart....and the competition for good thin crust has been getting stiffer and stiffer."}
{"text":"We love this place....we drive in from the burbs with the kids, they love it, we love it!!! Each if our 6 or so visits have been great"}
{"text":"Pretty consistently legit pizza......laid back scene......I prefer W.P. to UNA because its way less chaotic and the wait time is never longer than 15 minutes......great place for those who prefer Inglewood over 17th ave."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a working lunch, and while the meal and ambiance were pleasant, and I am looking forward to exploring more of the options, nothing really stood out.   Our table ordered a pizza Margherita, Caprese salad, roasted beet salad, and a Baby Doll pizza.   Salads were nice, though fairly standard takes on each, and at $12 and $11 respectively, well priced for what you get. The mozzarella salad looked great but would have benefited from a little more, or perhaps a more flavorful olive oil to offset the smoothness of the cheese. Likewise, the nicely dressed arugula and sliced roasted beets of the pleasantly plated beet salad were not as well served by the salty crumbled feta as they would be by a creamy, funky ch√®vre. (Though that could be a matter of taste...and rather nit-picky in my part).  The pizzas had a great crust. Thin, but not so apt to get soggy as some of the other places, with nice mottled charring on the bottom, a pleasantly developed flavor, and just enough chewy crust ringing each pie. The Margherita was more than enough for lunch for one for $15 and looked great (though I didn't try it). In hindsight though, I wish I had, as the Baby Doll (chicken, artichoke, feta, roasted tomato, eggplant, asiago) was pretty disappointing. There were just a few too many things going on with this combination, and the shredded chicken was so dry that it overwhelmed any bite that contained it. Now, the roasted eggplant and tomato were great choices, but they were offset by the mushy tinned artichokes, so in the end i wouldn't order this again, or recommend it.   No booze today, but the wine and beer list looked good, with a diverse selection and only one mediocre Italian import.   So. I'll likely be back, and the promise of the great crust and a better combination of toppings, coupled with the pleasant atmosphere and service mean I could certainly see this bumping up to a 4 with an update."}
{"text":"GF options. I've never been disappointed by their pizzas & wine. Love the atmosphere, service & location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday. The service was great! Friendly staff willing to help and answer multiple questions with no signs of irritation. Good beer list. The food was awesome! We had The Hutch pizza and it was amazing. The pizza wasn't undercooked or overcooked. This pizza has 2 kinds of salami on it so I was thinking king it would come out a greasefest like at a lot of other places, but it was so good and not greasy at all. This place has a cool environment and atmosphere. Not too flashy as to keep the attention on those you are dining with.  Great addition to the list of awesome places in Inglewood."}
{"text":"While walking around Inglewood today enjoying the festival,a taste of pizza was offered to us. After 1 bite we were hooked! We climbed 21 stairs to pizza heaven......WITHOUT PAPERS PIZZA.    Absolutely the finest in Calgary.   Try it!                   Ok ..so the first time at Without Papers was , as you can see above , a 5 star experience.  With high expectations we stopped in again 2 days ago. The place was packed with a happy crowd , busy wait staff, and a frenzy in the open kitchen. Parked at the bar with a cold bottle of Peroni, waiting for a table was great for people watching.  Finally seated, orders placed, ( try the meatball appetizer )  we awaited the main course.  As the pizza was on our first visit ...it was again this time . TERRIFIC,    DEFINATELY CALGARY's best."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see that thin crust pizza could stand up on its own without being soggy. Without Papers proves itself to be a worthy pizza restaurant and is now my new favourite in Calgary. Next time you go, try to get the margherita pizza with onions on top. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Holy god is the service here ever fast and is the pizza ever thin.  In my quest to try the all the \"we do the best mushroom and truffle pizza\" places in Calgary, I was at Without Papers on the weekend to see what their chefs can do with '00' flour, wild mushrooms and truffle oil. My pizza was at my table in less than 10 minutes.  Before food, a note on location: Had I not googled the address and followed my little map to the letter, I never would have found the place.  The sign is small and when you do think you have found it, one must stand in front of the door and decipher the words letter by letter because the type is so hard to read. Now, I'm not an 85 year old grandma, I don't wear glasses and English is my first language; but even I had a hard time reading this sign. I am a bit of a type snob and, I apologize Without Papers for the unsolicited advice, but you have some typography issues.  Once I did find it, get it, and apologize to my lunch partner for being 20 minutes late, starving, I ordered the Shroom pizza. Every pizza joint in Calgary has a version of this recipe. It's a simple formula: mushrooms of some variety + truffle oil + arugala + limited cheese + thin ultra, crispy crust. Without Papers' has studied their pizza math, because their formula hit the flavours spot on.  Through the flavour, the hint of truffle oil and the good price, there was one issue that stood out for me about the Shroom pizza. It's greasy. Literally, the pizza dripped.  Myself, I like a little grease, and sometimes even a little too much grease; but this was a little too much much grease.  However, the flavour outshone the oil and I ate every last drop.  Now that I know where Without Papers is, I will be sure to go there more often when in Inglewood; with extra napkins and especially if I'm in a hurry.  T."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner with a friend during the week.  We both loved the atmosphere of this resto - the windows that face out onto the street are gorgeous.  Our server was really nice and got us a table right away. We ordered a few glasses of wine and also had the margherita pizza to share. The wine was lovely and the pizza was quite nice as well. We both really liked the crust, and it was thin but sturdy enough not to flop when I picked up a slice. I had a bit of an issue with the pizza in that it wasn't seasoned properly. Both myself and my friend mentioned this - we could have used a little salt.  We also had a chocolate cake with chocolate cream cheese icing to finish off the meal. I really like that this wasn't super sweet. It wasn't anything to rave about but it was decent.  The things I like the most about this place are the space and the atmosphere. I would like to come back here for a few drinks and maybe some apps with friends. The movies are a unique touch..and if nothing else gave us something to talk about. This could come in handy on a first date if you ran out of stuff to talk about - just sayin."}
{"text":"Loved it! Living in Inglewood is great, really  unique shops and food, this is the new spot to go to, good ambiance to go with friends. Service is great too.  I tried the Hawaiian 5 -0 and it was pretty yummy... will have to go back to try other options... and salads!"}
{"text":"Double sad face for our experience at WOP :((  I think we must have caught them on an off night.  I've had great pizza from events catered by WOP, and previously had a good dine-in experience with them on a slow night.  We showed up on a Tuesday night at about 5:30.  We were seated and had friendly prompt service at first.  As the restaurant filled up, our server got increasingly busy.  It was hard to catch her eye as we wanted some extra chili oil and parm for our pizza.  She appeared pretty frazzled and had a lot of tables to look after.  She seemed to be doing her best, but she was being pulled in many different directions and the service suffered significantly.  The food almost made up for it.  I love the crust here - I'd say that it's the best in the city!  It's very crisp and crunchy - so if you like folding your slice in half, this probably isn't the place for you.  The shroom pizza was ahhhh-maz-ing.  It comes topped with arugula, a small drizzle of truffle oil, and topped with a generous amount of juicy saut√©ed mushrooms.  Perfection!  The other pizzas toppings were so-so.  We thought they could have used a drizzle of olive oil or a touch more seasoning because as is they were pretty dry and not very flavorful.  Ah well.  I had convinced my dining companions to go out of their way to come to Inglewood, and I was hoping for a better experience.  You should hope to catch them on a good night, because I'm pretty sure this place has the potential to be stellar."}
{"text":"Situated in the trendy Inglewood neighbourhood, Whitout Papers, is hands down some if the best pizza in town. If not the best. I know, this is a big statement, but it was simply delicious. A fresh taste, is what stuck to me. This place seems to be a good choice when with kids since they were playing The Minions on the wall. My 4 year old boy was pretty thrilled. He also enjoyed the pizza. I had the schroom & pizza the hut (if i remember correctly) They were both outstanding pies."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I decided on a last-minute meal at this pizza place on Saturday night.  It was busy when we got there, but we were greeted promptly by a server who quickly cleared a table for us.  We didn't have a reservation(I don't think they accept them anyways), so it was nice that we were seated right away.  We ordered a salad, the cheese and meat plate appetizer, and a mushroom pizza to share.  The meal started off a bit rocky due to one of us finding a stray piece of plastic in our salad.  Our waitress was quick to apologize and brought us a new salad which she took off the final bill at the end of the night as well, even though we never asked her to.  The cheese and assorted meat plate was the perfect size and the bread and spread that accompanied it was delicious.  I was really impressed with th quality of the items on the plate.  Finally, our pizza was fantastic!  A perfect crust with great toppings made this pizza worthwhile.  If you love mushrooms as much as I do, you won't be disappointed.  Overall, the meal was great and made better by the service we received.  The only thing I didn't really like were the strange video clips that were projected on the walls during our meal.  They seemed to be really out of place and distracted us from our nice meal.  Some of the clips took away from the nice ambiance of the place, but maybe I just didn't understand them.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends in the future."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit Without Papers for a while and today at lunch I finally got the chance.  We sat at a bright and sunny table right by the window.  This is a GREAT place for people watching!  Since there were two of us we decided to get two different pizzas and share.  We got the Baby Doll Pizza (roasted chicken, goat cheese, artichoke hearts, eggplant & tomatoes) and the Hawaiian 5-0 (ham, grilled pineapple & jalapenos).  I much preferred the baby doll pizza.  The goat cheese made it amazing.  I will definitely get it again.  The Hawaiian 5-0 was good but a bit underdone.    Without Papers features Grizzly Paw sodas from Canmore.  We had a float which made the visit even better!"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions and really dig the vibe, layout and the live music video aspect on the 2 walls. It totally adds to the cool factor of the place. In the past, i always had a good experience with both the food and the service. This time the service was excellent but wasn't as excited about the food. The arugula/ beet salad was boring and just kinda slapped on the plate. The taste was decent, just nothing to get excited about. And the Hutch pizza was decent as well but again, nothing to get excited about. I will definitely go back but i'm not as enthusiastic about this place as i used to be."}
{"text":"To get straight to the point, I think this is the best pizza in Calgary. I'm a fan of Una, Il Centro, Nick's, Famoso, Pulcinella and Hop in Brew. Without Papers does many of the things those places do well, and also excels in areas where other places miss the mark.  Everything about this place was great. It's on the second floor of a building in Inglewood and a seat by the window provides a nice view of street below. The atmosphere inside was very cool. It almost has a speakeasy feel to it. There are high ceilings, exposed brick and silent movies playing on two walls. The staff was very attentive and helpful. Our server recommended items to try on this and future visits and she even brought samples of wines we wanted to try, without charge and without us even asking for it.  We started out with beef and pork meatballs and a salad with romaine, wild boar pancetta, candied pecans and gorgonzola dressing. They were both very good. The meatballs were flavorful and tender and came with red sauce and shaved parmesan. We ordered The Replacement pizza: Prosciutto cotta, mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato sauce. It was fantastic. The sauce immediately jumped out as a star. The ingredients were perfectly balanced and the crust was thin and crispy. The table next to us tried a few other pies and they all looked great.  It's only been open six weeks but word of mouth is already starting to spread. I expect this place to be jammed in the coming days and weeks. I can't wait to go back and try more things. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Calgary. Cibo is a close second, followed by Famosa, but Without Papers definitely takes the cake."}
{"text":"I've only tried WOP twice.  Once was take-out, and once to sit down.  When I called for take-out, I was driving home and the girl on the phone was very helpful.  She even read out all the ingredients when I asked about different pizzas, since I didn't have a menu in front of me.  I appreciated the extra help she gave me, and suggestions she made.  When I arrived, the pizzas were ready, but I was shocked at the prices...I paid over $40 for 2 pizzas.  I was probably just expecting them to be closer to $30, but I should have known better!  Got the pizzas home, and my husband and I enjoyed them a lot!  Since I had such great service on the phone, we took my mother-in-law over on a Sunday night.  It was just before 5 when we arrived, so still lots of seating.  I'm not sure about the format though...are we suppose to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us?  We stood at the top of the stairs for at least a minute before any of the 7 wait staff who were standing there talking to each other, said something to us.  I watched other diners come and sit down without talking to a waiter, so perhaps I'll just ask next time.  Once we were seated it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask us about drinks.  We watched them stand around the counter again.  Clearly there are too many staff with nothing to do.  When we finally got to order our food, my MIL asked for no olives on her pizza.  They came with olives, and the waitress watched while we picked them off.  She came over to ask my husband about filling his beer and didn't say anything when she saw us removing the olives and putting them on my pizza.  She must have forgotten, but didn't offer an apology.  The pizzas were VERY salty...much more so than when we had take-out.  I might go back, only because it's within walking distance of where we live...but I'll be prepared for the poor service this time."}
{"text":"A true gem in Inglewood.  A yelp find and will make another visit for sure.  Had the spicy calzone, which hit the spot.  Very large portion and hot, fresh ingredients, and fast service.   The atmosphere is cool.  Old warehouse concept, with open beams.  TV's projected onto walls, which serves purpose, and is effective.  The beer selection is great including some favourites of mine from Phillips in Victoria.  Brewed coffee was lacking, but it was nothing to balk about considering the awesomeness of everything else."}
{"text":"I dream of pizza - particularly their mushroom pizza!   Seriously! I know that mushroom pizza does not sound exciting. In fact, it took me a couple of visits before I opted for it. Now, it is all I ever want there! (Even though I adore several of their pies.) It is really that good. Flavourful to say the least - not necessarily what you would expect from a pile of mushrooms.  The service is always prompt & quick, but I have never felt rushed. It is fun to hang out for a bit and watch whatever it is they are projecting on the wall at that time. The open kitchen also allows for plenty of visual fulfillment as well.  The space is cozy (despite the high ceilings!) I think it's the narrow staircase up that sets the tone. Check out the pizza oven in the open kitchen. It's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Myself and a few friends went to WOP on Father's Day a couple of weeks ago. Occupying the space where Nectar Desserts used to be, this contemporary-looking pizzeria is located in the trendy Inglewood area, and has a cool loft-apartment thing going for it.   Because it was Father's Day, the place was pretty busy, and there appeared to be only one server working all the tables. This obviously slowed things down a little, so we ended up waiting a long time for our pizzas. However they were playing old recordings of live Roy Orbison and Elvis concerts on the walls via a digital projector, so we had some form of entertainment while we were waiting.   I ordered the mixed mushroom pizza; a delicious combination of various mushrooms, arugula, truffle oil and garlic on a thin crust. The mushroom flavor was earthy and prominent, and the truffle oil gave the whole thing a rich, intense flavor, but in all the right ways. There might have been a touch too much of the oil, but ultimately it was delicious (albeit pungent).   I ordered an Italian import beer to go with my pizza, but the server did not deliver my bottle with a glass (and unless I am drinking crappy beer, I'd really prefer to drink it out of a glass, especially when I am at a restaurant vs a bar). My boyfriend and I both waited for an extremely long time for the server to check on us, so by the time we were able to ask for a glass, our beers had gotten a little on the warm side. And to make matters worse, when we did get glasses, they were straight out of the washer, and were super hot... so pouring a luke-warm beer into them wasn't super appealing. It wasn't really the servers fault, she was getting slammed serving the whole place pretty much on her own, but it seemed strange they were so understaffed, especially on Father's Day.  My other grievance with WOP is their pricing. If you average out all of the pizza choices on the menu, the average price per pizza is $20. That's a lot for a thin crust pizza! But I have to say, the toppings are delicious, and you can tell things are fresh and of good quality. Still though, $20 for a pizza you could probably eat in one sitting is pushing it for me.  A good place to try for people who like quality ingredients and take their pizza seriously. I'll definitely be back (once I get my next paycheck)."}
{"text":"hurray, real pizza in inglewood! hmm, i dunno if it tops il centro, but it is fantastic - with a nice open kitchen, so you can watch the pizza oven. recommend ordering the warm olives to start, and they make the wild boar prosciutto in house. i alo enjoy the quirk of the movie selection projected onto the walls: ranging from tim burton to disney to fellini."}
{"text":"Having been there a couple of different times now, I'd have to say the atmosphere depends on what time of day you go.  The first time I went was around 8 or 9 on either a Friday or a Saturday (sorry for vagueness, it's been over a year). It was nice, quiet, and the food and wine both were excellent. We didn't have to yell at each other to be heard (which is something I find often when I go out with my girlfriend - we both have quiet voices). Nice atmosphere. Then, this past Friday, we headed there around 7:00. What a stark change. Jenn D. mentioned that there were lots of kids there. On our first experience, it was quiet and calm, so I thought she was insane. Since I am as far away from parenthood as a Buddhist monk, I'm not a fan of dinner and conversation being interrupted by screaming kids. Unfortunately, that happened. A lot. I guess if we want a quiet dinner, we will have to time it better. Their food is good, their service was ok, but the screaming kid factor definitely lost them a star."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to get out to Without Papers for a long time now, and finally made it there last night.  My initial reaction was \"Wow!\"  When I left, I thought \"Wow!\"  Without Papers (or \"WOP\") occupies the upper floor of a unit along 9 Avenue SE in Calgary's historic Inglewood neighbourhood, just east of the Hose and Hound, and west of the Ironwood Cafe.  Being a pizzaria on the upper floor, it is rather warm.  This is particularly noticeable when the weather outside is cool, as it has been lately.  It also makes it quite enjoyable to go back downstairs afterwards into the nice, cool air.  The restaurant itself is an open concept, including the kitchen.  I was dining alone, so chose to sit at the bar where I could watch all the action in the kitchen.  Bar-style seating is also available around the stair well, while group seating is available around the perimeter of the room.  The music is not so loud that you would have to shout at your friends, colleagues, or family.  One very nice touch is the absence of televisions!  Instead, old black-and-white films are projected onto each of two large walls, above the heads of dining patrons.  (I got the impression, though, that Flames games are shown when televised.  I'm not surprised at this, but it is a bit of a turn-off for me personally.)  The menu is rather simple, with some very tasty options available.  I opted for the Hutch, which is a variety of spicy Italian sausage, and enjoyed every single bite.  As I was eating and watching the kitchen action, I got a few laughs as the pie maker punched some holes in the dough.  I also learned a bit about making a good pizza dough.  Overall I am very impressed with this place.  Friendly, prompt service, friendly (and attractive) kitchen staff, and delicious food make for a great experience.  No TV, appropriate music levels, and a nice, comfortable atmosphere makes it a fantastic experience.  Nice work, guys!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about W.O.P. and was excited when I had the opportunity this week to go there for a work lunch.  Unfortunately, I would have to say that I was disappointed by the end of lunch.  First, it seems strange that a restaurant that doesn't have traditional drink options like ginger ale or diet..., they were out of everything they did have.  Our waitress told me that \"oh, we only have the grapefruit and ginger beer\"...  I ordered the 'house made' lemonade and it was not good.  I would have rather been served a brisk... which is sad.  For appetizers we (there were four of us) ordered the house marinated olives, the beef and pork meatballs, and 3 of us ordered a Caesar salad (billed as with glazed prosciutto and an anchovy  vinaigrette).  The olives were terrible - I am a huge fan of olives and when these were put on the table, I was excited - multiple type and sizes of olives were in the dish.  Unfortunately, they were overly warm and the marinade was so strong that I could only eat one or two.  For a table of 4 guys, we ate about 5 olives.  The meatballs were served in a tomato sauce with some Parmesan - these meatballs would have been pretty good in a sandwich with some other nice flavours.  On their own, however, they were tasty but extremely bland - almost no spice to them.  I found that I was trying to spoon more and more tomato sauce on them just for flavour.   I love Caesar salad.  the description here made it sound great - glazed prosciutto, home made anchovy vinaigrette.....   The salad was a huge disappointment....  it seemed to be more of a Caesar that  came from a bag, except the dressing was weak and almost non-existent.  Only one of the 3 that ordered salad actually ate it all.  Now comes the reason I gave this place 3 stars not less...  The pizza.  I ordered the 'Pizza the Hut' - wild board pepperoni and it was really tasty and compared to other places in Calgary like Famosa - I thought the size, ingredients, and overall taste was better for the price ($19).  I would order the pizza again but wouldn't order anything else...  For me (i live  in the beltline), Inglewood is a bit of a pain in the ass to get to and I wouldn't make the effort just to go to W.O.P."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO GOOOOODDDD!!!! I have wanted to eat at this restaurant for a while now but things always got in the way and I really wish I would have gotten to it sooner as it rocked my pizza world. My best friend and I went for a quick dinner before an event at the zoo. We shared the caesar salad and the Prosecutor pizza. The caesar salad was really great, not too much dressing but a really nice balance between garlic, anchovy and vinegar taste. There were also fantastic croutons that I assume were homemade and i could have really just eaten a bowl of croutons.  The pizza had pancetta, arugula, caramelized onions and fresh mozzarella served up on a thin crust. The initial flavour of the pizza remind me of good french onion soup, with the onions and the cheese and then you got the saltines of the pancetta and it really rocked my world.  The service was great considering we didn't make a reservation and it was a Saturday night. This place gets BUSY so if you can try and make a reservation on their website if you can. We were seated at the bar that encircles the stairs into the restaurant and it was comfortable considering it was bar seating.   The prices are decent, its defiantly not inexpensive but not all the way to cost prohibitive. I feel that you defiantly get a top notch product for money spent.   It's seriously worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Without Papers hands down has the best pizza eating atmosphere in Calgary. The fact that it is on one of the trendiest little streets in Calgary is an added bonus.  I almost couldn't find it considering nothing in Calgary is on the second level. The trick is heading up the narrow staircase beside the restaurant Sugo and welcomed you are! Awesome open space with majority of seating banquette style around the perimeter of the restaurant. They have old movies playing projection style on opposite walls.. finally a place without a hockey game blaring.  I enjoyed the shroom with truffle oil pizza, potato salad, and GET THIS a ginger beer float for dessert. Delightful. Can't wait to go back with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"I really heart this place. I've only ever been for lunch, but have tried just about every pizza on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.   The atmosphere is great - I'm a sucker for exposed brick and this place has an abundance of it. The upstairs location helps it feel a bit more intimate, and if you're by the window it's always fun to watch passers-by on 9th Ave. They also usually have fun music and/or projections on the walls, so there is no shortage of entertainment!   The pollo pesto pizza is a favorite (this coming from someone who would not usually order chicken on pizza!), and they do a great job of the 'ol classic Margherita - LOVE it. The crust is thin but not too thin, and they offer dairy and gluten free option. The salads are also quite good, and to share a salad and pizza between two people for lunch is more than enough food at a reasonable price.   Drink wise they have a great wine selection, and also lots of artisan style soft drinks made right in Canmore (for those who have to go back to work after lunch!).   If I could suggest one spot for improvement, food wise, would be for some olive oil or something to dip the crust in. That would take a good pizza experience and make it divine!   I can't quite give it 5 start (4  1/2 if I could!!) as I have been disappointed by the service a couple of times -  just not quite as friendly or welcoming as it should be, but generally efficient."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find out I would be going with a few of my closest friends to try out WOPizza. I've heard so much about this place in regards to have delicious their pie's were so I had to try it out for myself.  Situated in Inglewood it is a place that you may miss on your many drives as this place is upstairs on the 1200 block of 9th Avenue and especially at night it is easy to miss. Already cold from the bone chilling night we made our way over to WOP.  Immediately you have to take a flight of narrow stairs to the top, if there are people coming down the staircase it is either a) you play chicken and see who will come out the best or b) just be polite and signal the other person(s) to come up/down first before you.  This place is lowly lit with lots of hint of the color red which makes me feel like I'm in some red light district and I just have to keep reminding myself I'm here for some pizza. This is definitely a cool and eclectic environment to bringing dates you might not want to see again but changing dates you will always get to have a pie here.  The service was impeccable. Our server was so attentive to our needs. He was quick on the drinks and making sure that he came by every so often to make sure we were still doing okay after we had received our pizzas.  Aside to the pizza's I have to say that I really love the meatballs. I kind of wish they were a bit bigger and 'softer' - I don't know how soft meatballs are supposed to be but it just felt kind of hard and frozen to me although the center was fully heated up and lovely.  Now on to the pizza's.  Shroom: Wild mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula, roasted garlic truffle panna - simply delicious and biased because I love mushrooms and the arugula were a nice touch to all of the pizzas.  Parma: Prosciutto di Parma, fresh arugula, fiore di latte, parmigiano, tomato sauce - this was also delicious. I love the thin crust and how light these pizzas are. It makes eating easier and you aren't stuffing yourself with crust.  Hawaiian 5-0: Canadian back bacon, pineapple, jalapenos, aged cheddar, mozzarella, tomato sauce - Hawaiian is hawaiian. I don't even like pineapples. I only like the soft served pineapple icecream at the Stampede. I don't mind grilled pineapples either. Hawaiian pizza to me is just pizza that I should probably have a slice of. I also wished the japalenos were way spicier.  Hutch: Spicy cacciatore salami, spicy calabrese salami, pepperonata, mozzarella, fiore di latte, tomato sauce - my favorite of all the pizzas. This pizza was spicy and wanted to burn the skin from your the insides of your mouth. Well, I might be exaggerating a little bit but it is definitely delicious and spicier than your average. A few slices of this pizza your mouth probably will go a bit numb.  I could lose my passport and live in this place forever. What's your favorites here? So I can eat it the next time I go."}
{"text":"Popped in for pizza before leaving on a trip - Without Papers had been on my list for a really long time and I didn't feel like doing dishes. Solution sorted!  Like the posters on the wall that pay homage to pizza puns in movie titles. They also have movies playing on the tvs dotted around. Place was pretty full for a Thursday night so would recommend reservations if you care where you sit - they do have counter space available at a little bar. Like that you can see into the kitchen to see how it is all done.  Started with the beef and pork meatballs which were a good size and in the most divine tomato sauce. Could have eaten this dish twice!  We weren't ravenous so decided to share a pizza. Told the lovely server our 2 top choices and told her to surprise us. Ended up with the Hog Wild - roasted garlic panna, wild boar sausage, salami, rapini, fontina, chili oil. It was pretty tasty. Little oily but think that may have come from the sausage and salami. Made the middle quite droopy and definitely a 20-hand needed eating experience. Would be interested to try a couple other options they have.  Drink wise I went with lemonade cause who doesn''t love house-made lemonade? Unfortunately I didn't like this one all that much at all. Not very lemony, quite watered down, more like well flavored water. Star lost due to sadness over lemonade :(  Would eat there again, but honestly have had better pizza at other locations in Calgary. When I factor in the price per pizza I will rather go somewhere that blows me away on the taste factor."}
{"text":"I found the gluten free pizza excellent. The service and location were great as well. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Cartoons or old movies in the walls. Delicious fourno baked pizzas and a view of 9th av. Great spot! Service is hit or miss but pizza is deadly.   They also have a gluten free crust - just ask!"}
{"text":"Pizza was not good, which is what their specialty is supposed to be.  The ingredients were all there, a great crust, artichokes, chicken, tomatoes, it just had very little sauce or cheese. I wished there was olive oil on the table, like in Italy, so I could drizzle it over this dry over priced pizza.  The service, the room, the style, the drinks, were all fantastic.   They should really fix the pizza."}
{"text":"Avoid shroom pizza, extremely oily and heavy on your stomach. Mushrooms are precooked and the amount of truffle oil makes the pizza soggy. Shame"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to WO Pizza a while ago, and a group of us get together every month or so to drink wine and eat pizza. It really can't get any better than that! The pizzas are a thin crust, so it does allow a better ratio of toppings to crust! Normally I like a good hefty crust (Chicago style deep dish, anyone?!), but their thin crust is so good. I typically get the Hawaiian 5-0; the slices of jalape√±o take this classic pizza to another level. The service is always good, the food is always amazing (though their version of the caprese salad could stand to be a little bigger for being $12, and I love me some tomato and fior di latte!), and great memories are always made here!"}
{"text":"This unassuming pizza spot has an amazing $125K oven that cooks up delicious thin crust creations! The menu has great variety from simple Margarita with only 3 toppings, to a four, five or more topping pizza with your choice of almost anything. Movies like The Wizard of Oz play on the walls of the restaurant as well as great music in the background. This place has a cool vibe! Service was very friendly and chatty"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things.  Checked this place out with my family while I was in town.  Quirky atmosphere with really great staff - friendly, charismatic, funny.  They play weird old movies on the wall until the live band starts (which then gets a little loud..).   Food was superb, though pizzas run a bit pricey at times.  We had the Sugo, which was sweeter and the meat lovers special -  both complimented each other.  For 3 of us, two was good but we probably could've had a third.  Great beer selection as well.  Great place, great neighbourhood.  Would come back anytime."}
{"text":"good thin crust pizza. cant say their mushroom pizza was better than Cibo's but it was good."}
{"text":"Had heard of this place, good things but had never been until tonight! We were not really in the mood for pizza (weird I know!) but we had to cross this place off our list of eateries and we were in Inglewood so.. up the stairs we went. I think we got the last table for 2. The place was packed. And loud. Not a great first date place esp. with the Red Hot Chili Peppers blaring, concert show on the wall. I was told that in the daytime, the restaurant plays movies on the wall without sound and at night, they play live concert footage.  Observations: This place is HOT, oven-like. The place is dark and has a cozy feel to it, me likes it dim! The place was packed full of 30 somethings, great crowd, fantastic buzz. Not a kid in sight. GREAT service despite the fact that the place is very busy. Super location in Inglewood. Beer or wine ONLY. No mixed drinks here. Pretty straight forward place. The bathrooms were clean - unisex.  TIP - if you are very hungry, order a salad or other appy. It took an hour for our 2 pizzas to come out as my hubby noted there was only 1 pizza oven and we had to wait in line. I could not see from my angle so not sure about that and we did not ask. I love that the pizzas are made to order and you can watch the guys throw the pizza dough in the air, open kitchen concept.  Ordered: The Hawaiian 5-0 and the Garden (veggie). Quite satisfied with our food, be prepared to pay $17-22 dollars for a pizza. The people next to us were smart. They split a salad that looked so fresh and deelish and then they shared a pizza. I guess we wanted to try 2 different flavours, excited to try this place out. It is intimate though, you will hear the people's convo next to you as there is no low talking here - one must be heard over the tunes blaring. I ordered the tomato sauce to dip my pizza in, it tasted sour, maybe I am used to sweeter sauces. I wish they had had hot sauce to offer, fresh ground pepper or even cheese to grate on top of the pizzas.  Just under $80 for 2 people with 2 pizzas and 2 drinks each. NOT a cheap place to eat but would come back in a heartbeat. Perhaps for lunch next time."}
{"text":"This is a very good pizza place. The doughs are hand stretched, and probably made in house. They have a good pizza oven that cooks at a high temperature, so the crusts come out perfect. They have a good variety of toppings and some interesting combinations. Nothing too fancy, but very solid.   The dining room is very casual and can get pretty loud. I wouldn't recommend this place for families, especially with young children. This is not a Boston pizza. This place is for adults who don't mind the noise, aren't expecting to be waited on hand and foot, and want to drink a couple of beers."}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to check this out! I've heard of it before, but they didn't use to go GF pizza crust, which now they do!!! Rejoices.   I came here with a friend of mine, as I was feeling pizza. We got there early so it wasn't busy at all, which was nice. Got a cozy spot next to the window where we could people/car watch.   I was super pumped to see the sold Bard's GF beer and Sir William Pear cider. Two things I love and don't see very often at a restaurant. For pizza I went to the Parma, which was delicious, little burnt, but still a good crust for sure.   My friend ordered the Hawaiian 5-0 and said it was super tasty as well. The price is pretty decent, for 4 beers, and 2 pizzas with tip was $70. Which isn't bad at all.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great salad & pizza. Nice atmosphere - overlooking the kitchen. I wish those pizza turners would 'show off' a bit more - like I did when flipping pizza at Angelino's in Wolfville while at Acadia University in Wolfville, NS - circa 1990!  Monday night has free corkage."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and a good atmosphere! Worth checking out for sure. The crust was perfectly cooked, the pizzas weren't overly creative or unique but they were delicious none the less. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is. The pizza here is okay. The toppings are good, but the crust is lacking. There are pizza places in the city that are much better. The service was brutal, not because our waitress was bad, but because she had way too many tables. The thing that is cool about this place is the decor and atmosphere...good mix of customers"}
{"text":"Want to give this place 5 stars, but can't because of the horrible service we received. Went there for my birthday dinner a few nights ago with a large group (9 of us total). Our server was useless. She would take an order (drinks, food, whatever) for a few people in our group and then leave to go dry glasses or do other random server things. We had to flag her down every time to get the rest of the table's orders in. On top of that she didn't even order me the right pizza, although she also forgot to charge me for it so I guess that worked out okay. It was still delicious, and I rate the food 5 stars, but the service left a lot to be desired. The ambiance was great, and like I said, if the service was even remotely good I wouldn't have a problem giving it 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've never been to Una (line-up is too long) or Double Zero (avoid downtown when I can), so I can't compare Without Papers to much else in Calgary.  A bunch of my friends arrived on a Sunday night. The restaurant was about a quarter full but there was only 1 server for about 5 tables. As a result, service was really really slow. I couldn't really get upset as it just seemed the restaurant was understaffed. The pizza was great - thin crust with delicious toppings. I tried the Hutch - which had lots of spicy meats and a good layer of cheese.  Personally, I think WOP is better than Famosa, particularly in the crust and topping ratio.  The mark up for some of the wines was a bit high for me but not outrageous. At least the wine selection is pretty good but limited. Great space - and I love the set-up. Great place for a date or a party. Can't wait to go back and try the mushroom pizza."}
{"text":"We took our family of five there on Monday evening for a birthday supper. We booked a reservation online, and a table was waiting for us when we arrived. The atmosphere is GREAT! The tables are high, so the booth benches and chairs are high, and they had Pink Panther cartoons projected on two walls. You could watch how they made the pizza in the kitchen, and all the staff really got along well, and treated the customers great.  Our server had water and glasses on our table just about as soon as we arrived. We ordered four pizzas to share and floats. The soda's from Grizzly Paw Brewing Company were a wonderful treat!  The pizzas were on a thin crust, and had an amazing taste. We ordered four unique pizzas just try some different flavours and none of them disappointed at all.  Our kids (20, 16, 10) had a great evening, and we enjoyed the food and the service very much!  We had just a little over one pizza left over to take home.  Very delicious, great service, and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Don't believe them when they say they deliver. I had an order all ready to go for a party of six people that started in an hour and when I called them they said they weren't delivering until April. Then I had to scramble to find a place when I'd already been bragging about the menu at this place. All well and good, but they need to say so on the website and on Yelp if it's not a service they are offering. Boo you guys, boo."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Good pizza, quality ingredients.  Close to work so it's a bonus."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is one of the best Tuscan style pizza that I've tasted. The crust is just the right thickness and crustiness with the perfect soft chewy texture to it. I had the Hutch which was topped with Spicy cacciatore salami, spicy calabrese salami, sauteed pepperonata, mozzarella, fiore di latte, tomato sauce while my companion had Pollo Pesto (Roasted free-range chicken, provolone, marinated tomatoes, pesto). I preferred the Pollo Pesto, the Hutch just needed something to complete the spiciness and saltiness from the various salamis. Service was not the best, our waitress showed us to our table and then left us for a good 10 minutes without even an offer of a drink and no menus. The restaurant had only 3 other tables occupied. The wait staff seemed to be preoccupied with each other and then she returned with a fairly wrinkled menu and apologized as they were short on menus. (They are photocopied 11x17 B&W menus... hardly a challenge to whip up in the office with any functional photocopier). We asked for ice with the water, she returned with a barely cold bottle and 2 glasses no ice). Ice seemed to be a scarce commodity as a 2nd request for some ice brought us barely half a glassful. I guess with the heatwave the laws of supply and demand truly kicked in and since we weren't paying for the ice it was doled out like gold.  Other than that the food makes the place worth going to because once you get your pizza you really don't need the wait staff for anything. Given that it was Stampede old clips of Johnny Cash, (he looked like he was in his 30's) were projected on the wall as he sang tunes from days of old. Once the place started filling up the noise level was fairly loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation. Tables are placed fairly close together so if you want a sense of privacy, this is not the place. You get to hear all about the neighbouring table's occupants' latest shopping spree and fight with the hair stylist. Prices are reasonable, the pizza were 10\" pizzas averaging $18/pizza, there is also a selection of appetizers but from the descriptions it didn't seem like they were too eager for you to order them (e.g. meat and cheese plate). Can't comment on the rest of the food, we just had pizza but I really liked the pizza."}
{"text":"WOP, is a racial slur for Italo-Canadians, which is a short form for Without Papers.    Italo-Canadians use the word 'wop' among themselves as a playful putdown. They are a bit edgy about non-Italians employing the term, as it is generally held to be a racist slur.  Here's another opinion and controversy around this slang.  Source:  http://www.billcasselman.com/wording_room/wop.htm  I went to Without Papers Pizza in Inglewood last night, and of course, had to ask why a pizza place was called Without Papers.  Well. I got my answer.  In case any of you were wondering, that was the answer I received.    I met my friend Heather there at 5:30 on a Tuesday night and it was quite busy.  We were able to get a seat, but by 6:00 p.m. it was packed.  We ordered the warm olives as an appetizer, and they were fantastic!  I am a huge olive fan to begin with, so a mixed tray of olives made my heart sing.  This was admittedly the first time I had olives warm, and my opinion is that it is a very nice touch.  For dinner, Heather and I each got a beet salad, with arugula and goat cheese. I liked the flavor of the beet salad, but I honestly found it a bit salty.  Heather, who LOVES salt, found it perfect!  The pizza we chose was the Baby Doll, which is Roasted free-range chicken, eggplant, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese and tomato sauce.  Since we chose such a low fat option, plus a gluten free crust, it wasn't the yummiest pizza I ever ate.  However, it was really good, considering there was no mozza and no gluten.  The crust was extremely thin, and almost crispy, and the toppings were all healthy, yummy options.  I was admittedly getting a bit of plate envy from the folks on either side of me, ordering a cheezier option.  When I hit my weight loss goal, I may need to come back and celebrate!  What impressed me about this restaurant was the vibe.  It has that hip, trendy feel, and I am also thankful that I went to a pizza place and did not have to resort to salad due to my diet restrictions.  I was able to participate with a healthier option and not feel like I was totally cheating myself."}
{"text":"I have dined at WOP and it's been great. However, I recently tried to order delivery as they advertise that they deliver on their website. I live in Bridgeland, an actual 4 minute drive from WOP to my door. I was told they would not deliver to Bridgeland as it is \"too far\" and the roads to get there are \"too complicated for their delivery moped\". Getting from WOP to my door requires no main roads and takes less than 5 minutes. Perhaps WOP should clarify what they mean by \"delivery\" and that their service only includes Inglewood. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"walked in and had no clue what was going on.  There was a funeral happening, seemed appropriate as this place will be layed to rest soon.  Wasnt greeted by a waitress or anyone except upon stumbling to the bar a chef who shed light on me as I was starving.  I sat at the bar and a chef gave me some help.  The pizzas were tiny and lacking ingredients and practically no sauce or cheese.   I've been to italy and pizza there is great but not 60$ for a couple small pizzas, and not without generous helpings of sauce and cheese.  I had the pizza the hut and the cup.  wheres the cheese?  Wheres the sauce?  The crust was dry and cardboard tasting, reminded me of Mcdonalds pizza.  For 20$ a pizza im sure the owner could afford to throw a bit more toppings on the pizza.  Theres a reason seniors pizza is the best pizza in calgary, and this place isn't.  The 10$ salad was pathetic, prepared earlier and tiny, the bacon bits were flavourful but no different than regular bacon bits.  The desert was prepared days earlier.  You cant pretend this is some kind of excellent french cuisine like Muse or others.  Im not having gastro-pub food here, and there was no foigras ontop of a rare tenderloin.  The chefs are 20 something kids with no experience.  If you want napolie pizza go to UNA, that place is the only place in calgary that I would say has actual napolie pizza, if cost isnt an issue.    I would call this place fast food for the hipster douche snob.  like the lego movie everyone there is cookie-cutter shaped, singing \"everything is awesome\" and paying 37$ for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Party of 8, made reservation over a week ago. Reconfirmed the morning of. Mentioned it was a birthday party as well. It's been a half hour of waiting in a very crowded, high traffic area. Apparently our table was given away and the patrons are having dessert and leisurely dining (which they have every right to do).  So folks, the learning point is, don't think a reservation and good service is a sure thing at Without Papers."}
{"text":"The pizza was good with lots of different choices but the service was a bit off- we had to remind our server that we had ordered an appetizer- and the noise level was LOUD. My granddaughter was seated across from me and every time I tried to talk to her she said 'I can't hear you!!' Adding to the  noise level was totally unnecessary music that I guarantee no one was listening to. I personally don't understand why people think that not being able to talk to the rest of the people in your party is acceptable when you are out for a meal."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Without Papers. Until tonight.  They must have changed the dough ingredients because what used to be a delicious thin, slightly charred crust is now a thick (and in our case, half-raw) awful tasting mess. It looks like they also tried to cut down on the toppings - they tasted cheap and it felt like there was far less cheese. What was served to us tasted like a bad pizza from Safeway.  On top of that, this place is expensive, we paid around $20 a pizza which is over half more than Famoso and a couple bucks more than Double Zero. I didn`t care before since I thought the Pizzas were amazing but I wouldn`t pay $2 for what was served.  I would avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I came here when I was in Calgary for their Fringe Festival. I had an hour or so to kill in Inglewood before the show I was seeing started, and I hadn't eaten so this seemed like a good dining option. Also I remember a blogger I met saying this was a good restaurant.   It was busy when I got here, and I had heard they don't take reservations, but because I was by myself I was able to get a seat at the bar. I was excited to see they serve Grizzly Paw sodas so I got a black cherry one. Yum.  The pizzas here come in one size, and are probably best to be shared, but I was hungry so I just ordered the full Margherita pizza. It's so simple (tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, some olive oil and sea salt), but when done right it's so good. The pizza here was delicious and the crust was pretty thin and had a nice texture, not too hard and slightly chewy. There was way more than enough pizza for me, so I got about half boxed up and enjoyed the rest of it for lunch the next day.  The server I had was really friendly, and quick to get my bill when I needed to leave. Definitely a dining spot to come back to next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"If you like affordable thin crust pizza, this is your place. Beautiful upper floor dinning area, with many young people as host, servers and chefs. The pizza (we had margherita and shrooom) was delicious and was served relatively quickly for how busy it was. Not my favourite pizza place in Calgary, but definitely one to remember.   The only issue we had was finding it. There is a door that you must find that's not boldly marked. It opens to stairs which brings you up to the dining room."}
{"text":"Honestly terrible pizza. I can appreciate a good thin crust pizza but our pizza was literally 2mm thin, and had maybe 5 cherry tomatoes total and dried up, thin red onion. It was gross. The bread was alright but toughened up very quickly. The drinks never got refilled and the server was painfully rude.  Lacking a variety in menu is acceptable as long as the limited menu is decent but this was gross and way too expensive. We left feeling majorly unsatisfied.   We would have been better off with Pizza Hut, which would also be a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"When I was first introduced to this place, I was blown away. I thought it was just sooo adorable. The pizza I had on the first night was really great, the server was awesome, and I loved the black and white movies on the walls!  I rounded up all my girls to come back on Friday night to share my new found hideaway and I have to say, we were all disapointed. Ther server just seemed annoyed with us the entire night. We had a bottle of wine, a few appy's, and 3 pizzas (amoung 4 girls), so I'm not sure why she was giving us so much attitude. Our pizzas were pretty sloppy this time around and I was send home leaving like a dog with its tail between its legs.   I did recommend this place to a coworker even still a few weeks ago and she came back with the same negative feedback, so unfortunately, I can't give this place my best review, even though I really want to.  What bothers me the most is the kids at this place. On a Friday night, it almost felt like we were dinning at a day care. Not my style. If I wanted kids and pizza, I'd go to Famoso. For upscale pizza and wine, I'll stick with UNA!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted to love this place... but alas I thought it was \"just alright\" on my first trip in there.  Maybe it was the expectations... maybe it was because I was craving Famoso but it was closed due to the flooding.  The atmosphere is cool and I enjoy watching movies projected on the wall.  The only annoying movie situation is coming in part way and not knowing what you're even seeing to check out later if you get into it. We ended up googling actors that appeared trying to find the common connections and link the plot (too difficult really).   Service was OK when available,  but I felt a bit neglected over all.   I had a margarita and my finance had one that was labeled spicy but the name escapes me and we shared a sweet julie for dessert.  I thought my margarita toppings were great - good cheese, excellent sauce but my main dislike was the crust.  I got the feeling they are trying to serve pizza like you'd find in Naples but have substituted another thin crust in there.  If you don't like the softer crust that goes a bit soggy and you probably have to fold over to eat like Naples pizza you might like pizza here better.  However,  Napoleon pizza is my favorite and I'm a sucker for keeping it traditional.   Crispy crust like without papers doesn't cut it for me.   My finance was disappointed with his combination of toppings.  He used the word boring even though he got a spicy pizza in theory.    The sweet Julie was also a bit of a disappointment.  This was nutella, Banana, Ricota and powdered sugar on the same crust.    To me it was a little bit too much of a Ricotta  pizza and that made it boring.   It wasn't overly sweet because the bananas were not quite ripe enough and there wasn't enough nutella and sugar on top. I should have saved the calories on this dish because it wasn't at all what I had hoped.   I'm not sure where I stand on a return trip.   It's way out the way for me and it's not good enough to go all the way just for that.   If I found myself in the area,  needed to eat pronto and was up fro pizza - I wouldn't hesitate to pop in.   If my friends really wanted to go there I would attend with.   Over all it was solid but not my preference."}
{"text":"The last four times I've been here, the food and service has been wonderful. It's steadily improved over the last two years and I highly recommend it for a gluten free pizza with fun video and great ambiance. It's a great place for both families and couples. A great place to go for lunch before walking around Inglewood."}
{"text":"\"You know how to TAKE the reservation, you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation - the HOLDING.\" - J. Seinfeld --- Arriving on time for a 7:45 p.m. reservation, we were told by someone (who looked just like one of WOP/Sugo's co-owners) that we would have to wait, as they just had to clear our our table. After standing by the bar for about 15 minutes, we asked about our table, and the same guy told us they were just waiting for people to pay their bill. Finally, in another 15 minutes or so, we were seated. When I mentioned to the guy (who looked just like one of WOP/Sugo's co-owners) that we had waited more than 30 minutes for our reserved table, he replied that reservations sometimes run behind. I said that while a short delay might be understandable, a half hour seemed excessive, and that the point of making the reservation was to allow us enough time for dinner before a concert later that evening. Placing his hand on my shoulder, the guy said, \"Don't worry, we'll take care of you.\" I'm not sure what that meant, since our server, while pleasant, was inattentive at best. But the pizza was good, and it supplied the energy needed to speed-walk to the concert."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to order pizza from and found this place on yelp. They don't deliver on Sundays so keep that in mind when deciding about your dinner. The restaurant is owned by the same people who own Sugo but it's more of a casual environment.   The atmosphere is warm, open, lively and friendly. The kitchen is open so that you can watch your food as it is prepared. The kitchen staff all seem very dedicated to their jobs. They have a wine list and make floats for the non alcoholics in your crowd. They use grizzly paw soda to make the floats which is made in Canmore. The beer list is very original with beers like Crabbies Ginger Beer and Rogue Dead Guy Ale. I noticed on their menu they have a dessert section which includes a banana split and a homemade chocolate cake. When was the last time you had a banana split? I watched while I waited as they made the poached pear dessert pizza and it looked amazing.   When I arrived to pick up my order it was about to come out of the oven, which is perfect for me because it was hot and fresh. I had a question about my pizza and the waitress wasn't sure but one of the cooks heard me asking and answered my question with ease. The place was maybe not quite half full. I'd say that's pretty good for 8pm Sunday night.   The manager/owner? noticed I was waiting to pay and helped me out. I had a interesting conversation with him about restaurants and how owners feel about yelp. He was a honest and open person about the subject which I appreciate.   The food was pretty good. Colin's pizza 'Hutch' was spicy and he said his crust was nice ( he's not great with words). I had the 'Prosecutor' with some dipping tomato sauce. I loved the flavors. My crust was a perfect amount of crispy and browned. We shared the meatball appy which was not bad but not super either. They were a little bland and tasted like any other meatball. They were however nice, soft and not over cooked.   In general I would say this restaurant is worth going to on a regular basis. I can't wait to try some more of the pizzas."}
{"text":"\"It's worth the wait,\" a woman next to me at the bar said. I wasn't sure if she was talking to me or more saying that to herself to ease her hungry stomach.   We did wait a while (about 40 minutes) for a table on a busy Saturday afternoon (no reservations here, lunchtime groups are the exception) but it WAS worth it. Perhaps our wait was eased by a free sampler Baby Doll pizza at the bar, but I really do think WOP Pizza is great.   Starting with an order of meatballs, our group was not amazed by them. They were a little dense and had not been simmered in the sauce they were served in, so were even a little dry, and not juicy or flavourful. I'd give these a pass next time.   The pizzas came out a little while after, but not before we downed a few Grizzly Paw soda floats that were creamy and well balanced. We drank these while talking and watching classic rock concerts projected onto the walls. I'd recommend the classic root beer or an orange for a creamsicle vibe while you watch Jagger and Bowie do their thing.   Three pizzas for four very hungry adults sated us and then some. We all had personal favourites, with the winner for weirdest, yet still delicious going to the jalapeno and \"grilled\" pineapple (grilled seems to mean canned?) laden Hawaiian 5-0. Crowd pleaser was the spicy Hutch (named after or by a girl who worked at sister restaurant Sugo, apparently) and Picci pulling up the rear as the classic.   Service was friendly, if a bit disjointed at times. Our dipping sauce came out several minutes before the pizzas did, and had cooled by the time the pies hit the table. But the server saw the mistake one of her coworkers had made and replaced it right away.   So how different can a new pizza joint be? Turns out not THAT different, but it's the attention to detail that keeps the place full. And in Without Papers' case, it's consistently delicious crust, fresh toppings and friendly service at a good price point.   Advice to those dining - pay your bill and move on so we can all enjoy the awesome pizzas at this joint!"}
{"text":"So, I am all immobile right now due to a lower body injury and desired to attend this venue. I e-mailed and asked about a reservation and this is the response that I received from no one less than the owner:  \"We unfortunately do not take reservations but that being said you can still come down and be assured of a table. My suggestion would be to not come down between 6 and 8 pm to avoid any lineups.\" Jesse Johnson Proprietor Without Papers Pizza  While I am temporarily handicapped this dude pops this response...is this place hyped because its 'new'? Hmmm. If you are limited mobility be aware that you will be shunned to \"off hours\" according to Jesse - the owner.  Pucinella takes reservs in Kensington AND they have been around for years with great service during the 12+ times I have been there."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place I was a little disappointed. We had a salad with endives that was not great in presentation nor in taste. Then we had a pizza with meat that was only okay. The place is very nice and cozy, but they were playing a movie and it was super loud. Not a great experience altogether."}
{"text":"I think that the delivery service is garbage, food is great but dont deliver. food came cold and forgot items"}
{"text":"I ate here last weekend & I have to say for a place specializing in pizza I would expect the pizza to be good, if not great. It was not. I ate here once before but my visit was more about the cocktails & I did not order pizza then. This time I did & was very disappointed in the food & the service.   First, the pizza... the pizza is supposed to be \"made from scratch\" & the crust sure tasted like what I imagine was chicken scratch. After taking 1 bite I knew I would not be eating the crust so I proceeded to scrape the toppings off with a fork to eat. The toppings on the pizza I ordered were okay but very scant; if there was cheese in there (one of the toppings was listed as cheddar) it was barely discernible. After a few forkfuls I pushed my toppingless crusts & uneaten slices aside.   Now, the service... the server was definitely playing to the stereotypical clientele: frequent the table of men seated next to us for a good tip & ignore the table of women who may not tip as well. FYI I usually tip 20% even if the service is mediocre; I tipped 0% this time. After taking our order the server did not come back to ask us how our food was nor offer to refill our glasses. After asking for our bill, we had to wait a very long time. We asked her to box up the uneaten pizza for my friend's roommate & much to my amazement she even boxed up the naked crusty remains of my pizza as well.  BTW I had already told her \"it was not very good\" when we asked for the bill.   Perhaps this restaurant bar used to serve good food in the past or perhaps it's more of a place to see & be seen. Maybe it's a nice spot to enjoy some drinks with friends or share some appies. Who knows?  I know the next time I decide to eat in Inglewood it will be at another restaurant. There are so many good restaurants to choose from in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good olives- terrible service - took far too long to make the pizza. And the pizza is pretty standard, nothing over the top amazing. Have gone a few times now, service has always been terrible. The last time we arrived... restaurant was over 1/2 empty, asked to waitress for a table for 4, grumbles from her and an I guess i can seat you over here.... \"you guess\"? don't do us any favors. I ordered olives to start.... and finish with, as she never asked again. No apologies on the social media feed. 5 servers standing around the bar chatting, but if you want water or food..... good luck. Apparently the bathroom is also broken and therefore the door does not close/lock. Without papers is without my vote. 2 stars only due to the delicious overpriced olives."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with some funky toppings.  Nice wine and great service too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was really good, the environment is warm and friendly. The waitress showed a bit of attitude, which was slightly off putting, but overall, it's a pizza place with a unique character in a part of town which has a lot of potentials!"}
{"text":"Without Papers is a welcome addition to the Napoli-style pizza purveyors in YYC.  In fact, I think it's easily the best in town.  Not unlike it's (under-rated!) relative restaurant, Sugo, Without Papers has excellent quality food, a sophisticated yet casual atmosphere, and a refreshing lack of pretentions.    The Hutch pizza is my favourite.  There's a review here that calls it bland, but I would suggest people try it for themselves.  It's probably their spiciest pizza so if you consider it bland, let me know and I'll have to turn in my spice-tolerating credentials.  Does bland mean awesome now?  I don't understand.  WOP has been consistently full on weekends since opening, but the turnover is quick so you shouldn't have to wait long.  They typically have take-out orders ready in 15-20 minutes.  They have great pizza, beer/wine, and consistently friendly servers.  I hope it stays in the neighbourhood for a long, long time."}
{"text":"We needed a last minute reservation as we had unexpected company arrive from out of town. We booked a reso for 3 and happily made our way over, excited since we had not been there before, but heard the food was amazing.   We arrive and although we had a reservation we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated- the table they set aside for us only had 2 chairs, since another table \"needed one\" and  they didn't feel the need to tell them it was reserved, and no other table was available. OK.   Finally get seated and we ask about the wine menu, and if we can taste the house white. ONE taster glass comes for us, so we all look at each other oddly and share the glass and decide it's good. Is there a wine glass shortage of some sort? Why would you bring one glass for 3 people to taste a wine?  Anyhoo we order salad, and pizzas. Salads arrive and they are overly dressed to the point of soggy lettuce. Our server was too busy chatting w friends at the bar, we eventually had to flag down someone else to ask to replace it. She did it, but she also gave the biggest eye roll. Then our server arrives back and we fill her in on what happened, she immediately apologizes and says it will be taken off the bill. The 2nd salads were perfect. Pizzas arrive and they are also delicious. We had to again flag our server down for water as she was off chatting again.   The service was horrific, the salads were a miss, but the pizza was fantastic. Maybe I will update this review on my next visit, but if the pizza was not as good as it was this place would only get one star. I love the area, and the open kitchen. But it seems here there is a kind of more friendship vibe with the staff/management, and it's a little like \"we try the best we can\" but they don't really care, if that makes any sense at all."}
{"text":"I love it. Love love love it. You wouldn't think this spot would be nearly as awesome as it is just by walking by it. Even coming up the stairs, I didn't know I'd be walking into such a spacious room-high ceilings, wooden floor, great lighting. It has the feel of a classy lounge, I'd want to hang out here on a Friday night for some drinks with my friends.  The menu is simple, a handful of plates to share, a few kinds of pizza, and a small but carefully chosen drink list. My friend and I shared a potato salad and house-marinated olives as starters (photo: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/ri2GZt8qyFcWUHxoQfsZXg?select=btpTv1rTt9WH561SZdj-nw). Check out the attached pic. The potato salad was warm and delicious on a bed of greens. The olives, oh my, I didn't know olives could be that big. They were almost sweet. I think I did most of the eating of the olive plate. We also shared the Hutch pizza (spicy cacciatore salami, spicy calabrese salami, pepperonata, mozzarella, bocconcini, tomato sauce). I could taste the spice, but thankfully, it wasn't enough to set my mouth on fire. For dessert, we split a bowl full of homemade strawberry ice cream and a piece of chocolate cake (photo: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/ri2GZt8qyFcWUHxoQfsZXg?select=W7k2b2ZifE3rSgSSM5Fu8w). Let me take a moment to wipe the drool from my chin as I relive dessert.  After all of that, we couldn't help but ask after the name. Why is it called Without Papers? The gist of the story is that the owners spent some time in Italy and when they came to Calgary, they decided to open an Italian pizza place. Now, many Italian pizzerias follow a specific recipe, right down to the types of tomatoes, spices, veggies, meats, etc. that are used to make their pizza. The pies at Without Papers, however, don't necessarily follow a methodology, they are made... without papers so to speak. And made quite well at that I might add."}
{"text":"We had our staff party here on Saturday night and had a blast!  The service was amazing and the food was out if this world!   They offer gluten free pizza which is a major bonus for me and judging by the reactions of everyone else at the table the regular crust was better than any of them had had. Thanks for giving us a great end to the year!"}
{"text":"Was super duper excited to try WOP... but wasn't blown away.  1)Had Tomato / mozza salad 2)meatballs 3)mushroom pizza.  It is the thinnest pizza that I've ever had.  I would describe it to be as thin as a paper clip!! no joke! Almost too thin?!  The fresh mozza in the tomato & mozza salad was delicious! Otherwise meatballs were super dry, and mushroom pizza was bland and had no flavour - seemed like they chose the most  bland mushrooms possible to put on the pizza, and it also had no truffle flavor.  I would go back to try the hutch and get me some spice! :)"}
{"text":"I never really expected to eat a great meal at a restaurant named after a racial slur. Luckily I had no idea what \"Without Papers\" stood for and thus my expectations were not biased when I dropped by this little pizza place yesterday night.  But first - let me say that I am seriously impressed by how well the city has revitalized the Inglewood area. It used to be a place I wouldn't ever set foot after dark, but now it's quite, to use a word that makes me feel like a 50 year old woman, \"quaint\". Well done, Calgary.  I climbed the stairs with lady in tow and we were greeted at the top with a man who had a radiant face that shone like a kiebler elf. He quickly got us hooked up with a table and we had no sooner sat down than a waitress stopped by to see if she could get us some drinks.  So far, so good. They didn't have the Maple Cream Granville that I had my heart set on, but I opted for a Pumphouse Blueberry Ale instead. Drinks are a touch expensive here ($6 for the pumphouse, a shocking $15 for a Rogue Dead Guy Ale) - but they come cold and the selection is eclectic.  My lady friend and I ordered the Hutch and the Hawaiian 5-0. They came hot, fresh, perfect crusts and a great amount of toppings. Thoroughly enjoyable. The Hawaiian 5-0 was a favorite with roast pineapples, jalapenos, ham and cheese.   It's a bit like me - sort of sweet, but with a spicy edge. I like a pizza I can relate to.  As we both repeated our \"bite-chew-sweat-dab\" eating routine, I immediately was reminded of competitor Famosa. On the whole, I've got to say that I like Without Papers just a little bit more - but I've had strong experiences at both.  While we were there they played old Christmas specials, The Life Aquatic and the beginning of the hockey game on their wall projectors. I appreciated the variety - catering simultaneously to hipsters, sports fans and seniors.   My experience here was A+ and I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"My birthday weekend had ended but I have amazing friends so they insisted on taking me out for birthday dinner.  We were just at Crossfit Ramsay when we were trying to figure out what was close by.   Tom asked if we had ever been to Without Papers...I've heard about this place but never visited so we decided to get some pizza.  Without Papers is located in the heart of Inglewood - Up some stairs at 1216 - 9th Avenue SE.   Street parking should be available.    As I was walking up the stairs I could hear some familiar old school tunes and the smell of something amazing.  When we got up to the top, we were greeted and asked for a table for 3.   We were sat at one of the high tops and handed menus.   Tom suggested a few pizzas as he's been here before and we decided to go with 3 pizzas to share.   At this point we were ready to order but the waitress hadn't come by- she must have forgotten about us!  She finally realized that she didn't take our order yet and came by.  The pizzas we chose to share were Hawaiian 5-0: Tomato sauce, Canadian back bacon, pineapple, jalapenos, aged cheddar, mozzarella. ($19), Pizza the Hut: Tomato sauce, wild boar pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, fontina cheese ($19), and Hog Wild: Roasted garlic panna, wild boar sausage and salami, rapini, fontina, chili oil ($22).   We were fairly hungry so it seemed like forever til our pizza arrived... luckily there was a film projected on each side of the wall so we can either chat or watch the film as we waited.  When the food arrived we immediately grabbed a piece of pizza and the crust was super thin, soft yet crunchy.  It was amazing.  I had a slice of each kind and my favorite was the pizza the hut, the flavors were great and the pizza wasn't too greasy...mmm meat!  The hog wild pizza came with rapini which is a green vegetable - when you took a bite, the whole rapini came with it, messy but delicious.  Hawaiian 5-0 was a spin on the original ham and pineapple pizza with a hint of spice.  Were the pizzas good??  Each pizza came with 8 slices and we demolished every slice, yes the pizzas were tasty!   We were leaned back in our chairs holding our tummies groaning because we were pretty stuffed but of course we all decided to get some house-made ice cream.  Chocolate, vanilla and pistachio were the flavors - I was defaulted to vanilla as we wanted each.  My favorite was the pistachio, I found the vanilla to be too icy.   Overall, Without Papers is a total hipster hang out spot where you can get comfy, watch an old school film while munching on some thin crust delicious pizza.  The service was OK, nothing special but the company I have is always amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been to some pizza places in my day let tell you! We all have haven't we??.... But without papers in one of the best pizza places I have ever been to in my 28 years on this planet! Our meal was literally perfect, not one small squabble or defect in the food. Perfect, it's a rare thing to find let me tell you!  I came here with here with my good pal and fellow yelper Andy D who is a true pizza connoisseur and boy oh boy were we ever pleased!   We started with the shaved fennel salad, it  had procuitto and also cooked pear a little cheese. It was perfect , super high quality and very fresh and  well presented. It was perfectly dressed, everything on the plate was delicious. Then on to the main event....  We ordered three pizzas, the margarita the shroom pizza and hog wild! Welcome to flavour city! All three pizza were so on point. They really go the extra mile and I can tell that whoever came up with their menu is some kind of food alchemist!  the seasoning on every pizza was so perfect it was uncanny!  The Hog wild pizza was the winner overall though! And get this it has broccoli rabb on it which makes it even better!!  These guys REALLY know what they are doing and I will be back let me tell you!!  A must try restaurant in Calgary for sure!!! WOP come check it out!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in Inglewood. Definitely a new favorite if I'm craving pizza. Great atmosphere and really good pizza."}
{"text":"We discovered WOP on the Food Network, so naturally when we got the chance to go to Calgary.  In the five days we were in Calgary, we went there twice.  Both times the staff was fantastic and the pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere and great food! We came in around 10pm on a Friday night and they had a live band playing which made the atmosphere even more enjoyable! We had ordered the primavera pizza and the let's meat again pizza and they were both delicious. The pizzas were quite big so I recommend sharing! The menu had quite a few different ice cream flavors which all sounded amazing but unfortunately we were WAY too full for dessert! The place is quite busy on the weekends so show up early in order to get a good seat to see the band! The location is beautiful as well!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been raving about this place since I met her! Before today, I had only done take out and was disappointed in the pizza that was delivered.  D assured me that if I dined in it would be a better experience, boy was she right!  So, when it came time to choose a restaurant to catch up with a few friends WOP came up and we all happily obliged. For drinks, we both ordered the Heartless Romantic Sour-Ale (we like our sour beers), we also started with the Caesar Salad with maple glazed prosciutto, parmigiano & spicy anchovy vinaigrette and the arancini to share.  The Caesar Salad was fresh, crisp and the dressing took it to another level, the arancini came out in 6 perfectly arranged balls that sat in a dollop of tomato sauce. These were hot and crispy that just oozed with rice and cheese when you cut into it.  As delicious as the appetizers were, the pizza was where the money is at! Besides, who comes to WOP and doesn't order pizza!? We decided to share The Sugo: pear puree, roasted pear, prosciutto, blue cheese, fior di latte, Shroom: roasted garlic truffle panna, wild mushrooms, arugula, truffle oil and the Hutch: tomato sauce, calabrese salami, genoa salami, pepperonata, mozzarella. The Shroom was (and forever will be) D's favourite, however, The Hutch was in a league of its own and was definitely my favourite (I love all things spicy).  Service was pretty good and it had a quirky atmosphere. Loved the fact they were playing a few Pixar films that were projected onto the walls.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night with some friends, good thing we had a reservation because it was very popular. We all ordered our own pizzas,  and everyone was impressed. One of my friends cannot have cows cheese so they substitute goats cheese on her pizza at no extra charge. There was also a decent selection of craft beers available.   Atmosphere was great and food was delicious. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is a quaint restaurant that has a family atmosphere.  The service was ok but the pizza was very good.  The flavors and toppings were perfect on top of fresh homemade pizza crust.  The price was right and you walk away feeling full and satisfied.   We will be back to enjoy the talents of those who make this great pizza."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and delicious pizza!!.. One of my favorites in the city!!.. The wine was also very good and the ambience was cool... It's not a romantic spot as is normally very busy (I recommend to make reservations) ... But is a great place to go with a group of friends, have a good time and excellent pizzas!!.."}
{"text":"Decent pizza joint that was a great stop for an early dinner after doing a class next door at 4Cats.  The place was mostly empty when we arrived, though the server seemed to really struggle on where to seat us. Other than one large-ish group that came in about 15 minutes after us, I'm not sure what the issue was.  The service overall was ok. The staff seemed distracted amongst themselves at times but I wouldn't say the service was bad.  The pizza. I went with the spicy one, can't remember the name. When they say spicy they mean it, which is surprisingly nice for a change. The problem though was that my pizza was overcooked. Burnt crust around the edges. Not un-edible, but less enjoyable than it should have been. My wife went with whatever their version of a Hawaiian pizza is, which she quite enjoyed.  In my experience here this place reminds me of living in Toronto and going to many of the hipster-y restaurants there. They're trying to do something a little different, but it's not really all that different. The staff are there to get a pay cheque and its a means to an end while they try to do whatever it is that they want to do with their lives. They play old, and sometimes obscure, movies on projectors shining on blank walls instead of a screen for some sort of nostalgia thing, but meh."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and our waitress was friendly and helpful. Wine was nice although I don't like the stemless glasses. My hand warms the wine.  I ordered the mushroom pizza with truffle sauce but was disappointed.   The truffle sauce was too heavy and tasted oily and stale.  It made the mushrooms seem to be floating on a not so nice cheap cream sauce.  We asked for salt and red pepper which made an improvement and overall we had an enjoyable evening. Next time I'll order a more traditional set of toppings."}
{"text":"The more I learn about Calgary, the more it reminds me my hometown of Portland, OR (a rather, weird, grungy half-sister to the more cosmopolitan and modern Calgary).    My Calgarian friends tell the tale of a sketchy, rundown neighborhood called Inglewood who is experiencing a renaissance of sorts--very much like the northeast side of Portland.  Behind a red door and up a narrow staircase lies one of the masterpieces, Without Papers!  Our table had the brilliant plan of all ordering different pizzas and doing a pizza-swap.  As a result, I tried the Hutch, Hawaiian 5-0, Margherita, Shroom, and Parma.    The Hutch and the Hawaiian 5-0 are loaded with toppings, so if you're looking for a \"tried-and-true\" pizza, look no further.  The Shroom pizza boasted decadence and burst with truffle aromas and flavors.  It was almost too much.  I ordered the Parma, savory with its delicate balance of the bitter arugula and salty prosciutto.  My favourite, though, was the Margherita.  It was simple, yet elegant--rustic and comforting.  You can really taste the tangy tomato sauce and the melty, rich mozza.  (Dang, I'm craving this pie just writing about it!)  For you pizza purists out there, this is THE one.  The atmosphere is unique and the menu is deliciously compact and varied.  My only regret is that I don't live in Calgary to have the honour and privilege to come here more often."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and perfect pizza , i loved it , try there s place if you want try somewhere different"}
{"text":"We decided to give the place a try, and had the Primavera Pizza with added wild boar pepperoni. It was pretty good for a pizza without sauce. Crust was nice and crisp.  Price was comparable, to places like Una or LDV, and the pizza was a good size. Service was ok, definitely could have been better."}
{"text":"Going out for Pizza is a Toss Up in Calgary but \"Without Papers\" Pizza in Inglewood had some of the best tasking and constructed Pizza we have dined out for in the city; however, we had to wait a long time for it.   It took 70 minutes to be seated and an additional 20 minutes to have our order taken. It actually took   2 full hours   (yes we timed it) to be served our pizzas from the moment we arrived.   I think under any circumstance that is a sign a restaurant needs to do some thinking about the process for seating and keeping your customers satisfied while they wait for extended periods of time.   My advice, train the staff to kindly ask the patrons who are leaving to actually leave instead of standing at their tables talking away (pretending to leave like a bunch of douchebags) while numerous people are waiting to eat.  My other advice, have someone work in the bar during peak hours to serve people standing around waiting for a seat. And speaking of standing... any chance there could be some stools at the bar for those waiting around?  Recap: two critiques for this location are:  1. Not a large bar service and limited menu options for cocktails.  2. Not very effective table triaging during busy times. Long wait time was over the top.   Compliments on the great pizza and cool location."}
{"text":"First off I must admit that I am a huge pizza fan! I would happily eat the stuff for breakfast lunch and dinner for the rest of my life if my waist line would cooperate. I am on a never ending hunt for the next best pizza.   After reading several reviews and seeing without papers named as one of the best pizza places in Calgary, I thought I had better go try it out.  When you first arrive you will climb a very steep flight of stairs so keep this in mind if you have any kind of injury or disability. When we reached the top we were quickly greeted by a friendly server and seated right away. The atmosphere here was interesting with movie posters representing some of the different pizzas on the wall, art work for purchase,  it was an open kitchen and you could watch them tossing the dough and preparing the pizza which was kind of neat and the movie \"Up\" was being played (with subtitles no sound) via a projector on the white walls. It seems to be a very family friendly place as there were some families present with kids as well.  I noticed some complaints in the other reviews in regards to the service, so we were a little worried about this. However we found the service to be exceptionally good! She was fast, friendly, funny, and not overly present. She came quickly with our beer order and quickly with our bill at the end. Absolutely no complaints there.  Now on to the pizza. We decided to go with the hutch pizza and the pollo pesto pizza. Of the 2 the hutch was hands down my favorite. It was a nice light thin crust pizza, with good quality cheese, and the spicy calabrese salami really made the flavor. Very tasty pizza. I wasn't a huge fan of the ends of the crust  (believe it or not if its a really good pizza I eat this part too) but over all very flavorful. The pollo pesto was my husbands choice. I am not usually a huge fan of chicken pizzas but this was pretty good. It had a nice pesto sauce on it which was a nice change if you are looking for something a little different.  Overall I enjoyed this pizza and would probably rank it about #4 in my personal list of the best pizza in Calgary. I don't really have much to complain about but some of the others just do it better."}
{"text":"I was invited for my friends birthday. It ended up being just 3 of us.  The service and staff where unbelievably great.  The food was Amazing. As a cleaning business owner the restaurant was very clean.  I was so happy I came back the next day again for the pizza.  It's easy to eat. Super full of flavour and all about great experience.  Thanks guys. Steve from get a life cleaner Inc"}
{"text":"OK, so maybe the irony is intended but this Without Papers place serves up delicious pizza with a crust as thin as - well - PAPER!  Pizza bars seem to be the thing right now and are popping up EVERYWHERE! Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining - I adore pizza. Its Saturday night and we're heading to a movie and need a quick meal that is moderately cheap and something I haven't tried. Of course, that new pizza place in Inglewood (in the old Nectar Desserts store) that is a part of Sugo downstairs. We head over.  It's more casual that I expected which is cool as its pizza after all - let's not be pretentious for the sake of pretentious. Pinocchio is playing on the walls which was interesting as it's been a good 20 years since I saw it so it created some discussion with us about the idea behind the movie. I like when restaurants (i.e.: Tubby Dog) play movies on the walls as it creates a comfy, friendly atmosphere. The seating is high stools along both sides and then a couple chairs and tables at the end by the windows. Cozy.  Service and seating are fast and the server is pretty great and cheery. Beers are ordered (about 15 kinds on the menu) and I see that they have a decent wine selection to match and a menu of \"pops\". The menu is intriguing with some appies I want to try (no time tonight), an array of concocted pizzas (of which I want to try six) and desserts. We settle on \"Hog Wild\" and \"Hot Cock-a-doodle-do\" as our two choices to mix and match with. The order takes about 25 minutes which is decently fast on a Saturday at 6:30pm, and the waitress is checking up on our beers to be sure we're doing ok. We dig in and decide that WE LOVE THESE PIZZAS (it took maybe two bites). The spicy chicken was amazing with the most delicious melted fontina cheese and spicy chicken pieces. This was also covered with saut√©ed colored peppers. The pizza is strikingly simple and I'm not even sure I can count more than three things on it - but rest assured, I was loving it. The crust is 2 mm thick - I mean paper thin with a perfect crunchy \"end\" that was sweet and toasty (not doughy). This might be the best pizza crust I have had in a long time. The hog wile was a mixture of ham and sausage with broccollini on the top. It didn't look as good as mine, however, it lived up to the flavors. Again, very simple with just the right amount of cheese, meat and veg. Not overdone but very tasty and flavorful. The pizzas are six slices each (we easily finished it all) and are 16-24$ each.   I shall be back as these were some fine style pizzas that require further investigation (and by investigation I mean there are another five kinds that I need in my mouth). Service was great, food was good, atmosphere was chill and fun, and the menu requires another visit with more time for meatball appies and ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that WithOut Papers abbreviated is a racial slur, I really liked this place.  Discussing with my friend where we should go for dinner, as we had decided to step outside our normal neighborhood, we began playing with the idea of going to Inglewood and Without Papers came up.  \"The poor man's Una,\" said my friend. This sealed the deal and our plans were set.  Our group of 5 showed up around 7:15 on a Friday, the place was busy. They don't take dinner resos, but they are now starting to accept a limited number for lunch. I could see a bunch of other parties standing around waiting for tables and I started to get nervous. I was on the verge of being hangry, and the fact we had a party of 5 would mean we wouldn't eat until 9:00 pm. The host approached and told us it would be 15 mins and asked if that was ok.  I thought he said an hour and 15.  My friend assured me he said 15 mins and my jaw hung slackly open, she was right this wasn't Una, we were not on the heart on 17th ave and were not going to have to go kill time for 2 hours until a table became available. We moved off to the side to not intrude on those seated near the stairs. I started to take in the atmosphere, I had frequented this space when it was Nectar, and though I longed for those comfy armchairs, the setup with the banquets is lovely. They had basically a baby boomers dream concert being projected on both brick walls, as we waited we were treated to the songs of the Pips, Rolling Stones, James Brown, from their prime in black & white.  We waited about 15 mins and the parties ahead of us were seated, but the host came over and asked us if we would like to order drinks, the beer came and the rest of the wait (maybe another 10) zipped by quickly and were soon seated.  Our waitress came over promptly, and was very friendly. We were hungry, so we ordered the assorted cheese and meat plate to tide us over while we made final deliberations on which pizzas to share. We decided on the Hutch, Parma, Four Cheese and Shroom. and then boom our meat plate was there, with lots of lovely pizza bread and housemade jam for dipping. The jam was the star, one of my friends ended up buying a jar of it ($15), it rotates frequently, we had plum jam. I wish there had been a bit more cheese, but this plate would have been ideal with 4 of us sharing rather than 5.  Soon the pizzas arrived and all were very good. If I had to rank them in order it would be: parma four cheese shroom hutch The hutch was almost a little too spicy for me, I feared having heartburn half way through, but still enjoyed it. All the others were amazing, great pizza dough and flavours.  We will definitely be back, its a great atmosphere, excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Without Papers is a tasty pizza place, but in contrast to the multiple offerings now found in our beautiful city, they just don't stack up.  Standard toppings and lacklustre service makes this only get a 2 star.   Our server was often too busy chatting up her buddies or with another customer, and ignored our table too frequently - especially annoying when you let your server know you are in a bit of a rush for an event after the dinner.  I had a jalapeno Hawaiian pizza, and it was tasty, but nothing to write home about.   I'd prefer to go elsewhere like Double Zero, or even Famoso in comparison to this place.  Their crust is just a bit too stale for me."}
{"text":"Had read the reviews after my friend had already made reservations and thought \" OH OH\" but the food was awesome...Service sucked..."}
