{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Julia's for years - both dine in and take out. I've notice lately the food isn't as good, the portion sizes are beyond small and their is an extra charge for everything. I took my daughter there tonight - we were never offered bread for the table and service was slow. I ordered Gorgonzola gnocchi for my daughter - when I got the bill I noticed a $3 extra charge for getting gnocchi instead of penne. I ordered a gluten free pasta which they also added another $3 extra add on for the gluten free pasta. I was upset last time my husband and I were there, the waitress asked if we wanted gluten free bread for the table I said yes only to discover they charge you for it. The extra charges are a bit much but if you're going to charge people more for simple things like bread or a different pasta the server should tell you. I may need to find myself a new \"go-to\" restaurant in Oakville."}
{"text":"I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of Julia's.  I have been many times, for dinner, lunch and even just for dessert - for business, special occasions and just a meal out, weekdays and weekends.  We held our son's Christening there several years ago, with a large group of about 30 people, with a pre-set menu on a Sunday afternoon and using the side dining room.  I've enjoyed my meal there each time.  I have found they are generally good in accomodating for a children's meal.  I like the atmosphere and this is often a first choice when choosing a birthday or anniversary dinner.  Writing this review makes me crave another visit!"}
{"text":"Eaten here 6 times in the past 3 years and had a wonderful meal every time. Best location East of Trafalgar for a summer outdoor patio lunch."}
{"text":"I had such a delicious risotto here, I can still taste it!  My caesar salad was good, the homemade croutons were a nice touch.  For dessert, the tiramisu is a must.  I'm not a huge fan of tiramisu but this one was a stand out.  Classy yet casual, this place is in a nice location.  Julia herself was there, greeted us and even chatted a bit about his restaurant journey.  I recommend."}
{"text":"First time here. Had lunch and was impressed. Service and food quality was very good. For a Friday at lunchtime it seemed very empty in the restaurant as there were just a few tables occupied.  Server was great. Paella was fantastic. I would recommend this dish for lunch.  I will be back for lunches and will try dinners at some point."}
{"text":"This place is more of a Toronto 3 star, but for Oakville standards I'll give it a 4. I had the caesar salad which as a connoisseur the dressing was about as good as you get at a restaurant. The jerk duck didn't feel like a huge portion, but was perfectly spiced and the accompanying potatoes were tasty. It's not the best, but if you like the menu, you won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"CAUTION:  Long rant ahead.  I convinced my group to come here for a birthday celebration*.  Julia's let me down.  Firstly, they had no record of the reservation I made for us only a couple of hours earlier that day.    Secondly they didn't have our first choice of wine, nor did they have our second.  Rather than asking us again what we would like, they just brought us a bottle of their choice.  This whole wine process took at least half an hour to figure out.  Next, our waitress didn't want to take our orders for some reason.  We all sat there, menus closed, for an eternity, without the bread and olives that every other table seemed to have.  We eventually got our waitress' attention and order a shared appetizer - the Julia platter, and took this opportunity to order our dinner entrées before the waitress escaped yet again.  Another 15 minutes passed before our table got bread and olives.  We were starving at this point and emptied the basket in seconds.  No refill was ever offered, which would be tolerable if our appetizers ever arrived, but they didn't.   We continued to sit foodless for another hour.  We saw many tables of people who arrived after us get served before us.  We were so hungry we contemplated trying another restaurant across the street.   With their open kitchen, we could see everything going on, so we were extremely excited when we saw a Julia platter sitting there ready to be delivered.  Our waitress picks it up and... delivers it to another table of guests who arrived after us.  I think that's when we all made angry faces, which invited the waitress to visit our table.  She explained that they were extremely busy due to the popularity of their patio (which is big and beautiful) and that our entrées would be out soon.  A member of my party couldn't help but bring up the fact that the other table that arrived after us received the Julia platter before we did.  Our waitress explained that the Julia platter doesn't take as long to prepare as some other dishes.  We all answered simultaneously, \"WE ORDERED THE JULIA PLATTER!\".  \"Oh, that's my mistake.  I guess I forgot to order it for you guys.\"  That's when we cancelled the appetizer and waited impatiently for our dinners.  I was actually impressed with my Pollo di Mole Poblano.  Interesting dish with a weird combination of ingredients including nuts, chilies and chocolate.  Other members of my party were extremely critical of their dishes, probably because we got our food an hour and a half after our arrival.  I checked my watch and promise this is not an exaggeration.  In the end there was a less than adequate apology from our waitress, no compensation for the mess-up and no attempt to win our return business.  I apologized to the group for having made them suffer through this awful dining experience.  *Thank goodness it wasn't my birthday, it was somebody else's.  I don't celebrate birthdays."}
{"text":"Service was very good but the food was mediocre and expensive for what you got. My husband had the mushroom bruschetta which had almost no topping, little flavour and huge, thick bread. I had the skillet shrimp which was ok but not great. The Caesar salad was good. My husband said the best thing about the braised rib was the tomato on the side!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!  Had dinner with mom on a Friday evening.  We sat outside and I enjoyed the ambiance.  Had the Marisco Salad with prawns, calamari and a fish patty - it was a nice, light option for such a hot evening.  My mom had the sweet potato crusted salmon.  I was surprised at how large the portion - a big piece of fish on an even bigger mound of quinoa!  The presentation of both dishes was lovely.  And our server was really attentive!  Great food.  Great service.  And great cocktails (loved my mojito!)."}
{"text":"Came here before a few times with the fam and it is a lovely little dt Oakville spot. Food is good but what I find the nicest about here is the decor. It's very intimate and cozy and they often, as I'm told have live music playing with current songs which I thought was a really nice touch. There brunch menus has good selection bound to please all palates."}
{"text":"For the food, friendly staff, intimate environment. Love the red accent colours. :) Queso Flameado (oven baked cheese dip) was awesome! Oh, and our server Michelle has a great smile and is very attentive. Much love! -EM  P.s They support local farmers! Yay!"}
{"text":"I've been here for both dinner and lunch sadly I don't remember the dinner very much.   However, sitting on their patio on a beautiful summer day I do recall having an incredible beef sandwich (latin flavouring) with a fried egg on top.  One of the most remarkable sandwiches I've had in my lifetime, this thing was big, juicy with such depth that had me excitedly anticipating each bite.  The owners and staff were very friendly, and had a real genuinity that said \"take your time, enjoy yourself\".  Fantastic sandwich. A revelation for me.  5 stars...  Anyone?"}
{"text":"Julia's is a tried and true gem of a restaurant in downtown Oakville. The ambience is mellow - perfect for a quiet dinner with wine and conversation.  I had the salmon and crab cake for a starter and the jerk duck as the main. The duck was delicious! Especially with the braised cabbage and bacon. The service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Had Mother's day brunch. The food, the ambiance and service was excellent. A nice spot in downtown Oakville."}
{"text":"I've ben there a few times I love sitting out on the patio it's always calm and relaxing. I've ordered the salmon twice and it is always very good my only complaint is some times the staff is a little \"off\" If you're not buying tons of drinks they pretty much give you half ass service"}
{"text":"I was expecting more. The main dish I ordered was good but not worth the price. I ordered Calamari to start, which was breaded and excellent. The main dish: Julia's Paella, I expected something different but it was really filling and enjoyable. I found the rice to be bland and the sausage spicy, I can't handle the hot spicy aspect of this dish. The dessert was the bonus. It is called Peanut Butter Banana Brûlée. Nicely presented and I finished the whole thing. It came in three pieces, small pieces but it was too much for one person. I ordered too much but no regrets. I did take the calamari and corn bread home. I'm not a pig. I also received complimentary corn bread with fresh bread and oil dipping sauce at the beginning. So I had two starters for one. I guess I paid for what I received. Great service. Nice location. I'll give them five stars after my second visit. Thanks Julia's chef. $65 tip incl. for one person. Wow!"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favourite restaurant for the last twelve years.  We went there today and both of us were very disappointed to the point that we may go back.  Service was slow but the most irritating thing is the new policy of charging for every request. We asked for gluten free pasta and it's now $3 extra.  We asked for extra sauce on the pasta and that was another $2.  When it arrived, it wasn't evident that anything extra had been added so we asked again for extra sauce. Surprise...another $2 charge for asking for extra sauce again.  The staff simply shrug and say that's the policy.   This was a great spot for an awesome relaxed meal but the magic is gone. Good bye Julia's."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm disappointed with the portion size and quality of the food. Cesar salad was great but it was two lettuce leafs max; had their 'sirloin' steak but it was mostly grissle and drown in HP sauce. I could've made better food at home for less than $60. Service was nice, but slow and unattentive."}
{"text":"Mother's Day lunch was fantastic. Oh, sooo good! Amazing food, ambiance & great service. Best guacamole I've ever had! Warm seafood salad & gnocchi to die for."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the bread basket. Corn bread? How awesome! I've never seen this at an Italian restaurant, but I will say it was a nice surprise. Additionally, the olive oil and balsamic vinegar that came with your bread also had olives in it which was a nice touch.   In terms of the meal, I had the salmon with a side of truffle mac n cheese. Being a mac n cheese lover, I obviously couldn't resist getting a side of that stuff. It was surprisingly lighter than I would have anticipated, which is a good thing. The truffle flavor was perfect and not too overwhelming too.   The salmon was cooked perfectly, and had great flavor. The quinoa was a bit odd to add as the grain, texturally, it wasn't my preference to match with salmon, but overall a tasty dish!  Lastly, let's just saw the wine was fantastic. I highly recommend the house Chardonnay."}
