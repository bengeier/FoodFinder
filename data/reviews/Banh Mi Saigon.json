{"text":"Sérieusement. C'est bon en Ta'! En plus j'habite à côté. C'est magique. J'aime le fait que c'est le propriétaire qui te sert et c'est sa mère qui cuisine. On est loin des Thai Express et compagnie. C'est du vietnamien. Y'a pas trop de choses sur le menu, ce qui simplifie ta vie quand il faut choisir. En plus, tu peux apporter ton vin! :)"}
{"text":"The banh mi at this restaurant is the bomb! My favorite is the chicken banh mi and I always get ask for extra sauce. The pho there is also good."}
{"text":"I went here to pick up some food when a friend of mine wasn't feeling well. The restaurant was close to our loft, fairly convenient, and the prices were decent. I tried the pho and it was tasty though not as flavorful as some others I've had. This neighborhood seems to have a lot of Vietnamese restaurants, and I'm not sure that this one is the best, but it was alright and worth checking out if you were in the neighborhood."}
