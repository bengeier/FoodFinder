{"text":"For my money this is the best place in Madison to get a gyro.  The place is a little shady and hasn't been updated since it was built, but you'll get a lot of good food for not a lot of cash and you will get it with a smile and that makes all the difference.  The gyros are essentially the same as Parthenon and, for that matter, 99% of all gyro places.  I go with the gyro dinner, however, which is double the meat and is absolutely glorious in all of its artery clogging goodness.  I've never tried any of their other items, but they have your usual deep fried fare if you are so inclined.  Also, the owner always seems to be there and in a friendly mood as opposed to the dour S.O.B.s downtown."}
{"text":"We tried to go here November 2008, and it was closed down.  While driving to the mall the other day, we noticed that it had reopened, so we decided to give it a try.  We were pleased with what we got, though it was more expensive that we thought it would be.  My husband picked up 3 gyros and fries and brought it home for lunch.  The gyros were very good, some of the best ones we've had in Madison.  Good pita, with a little bit of a crunch on the sides.  Meat wasn't gamey at all.  Fresh onions and tomatoes.  And tangy tzatziki sauce.  They don't have the skinny fries but steak fries which were nice and crisp.  However, we were a bit surprised that they charged $6 a gyro and $2.50 for fries.  It's not that much more expensive that the places downtown, but still a little more.  BUT, our meal was very good, and with the location is convenient for us (on the East Side), Dimitri's Gyros just might be our go-to gyro place."}
{"text":"After reading other Yelp reviews, I decided to try Dimitri's, unfortunately. The gyro meat was bland...gyros are not meant to be BLAND! We also tried the so-called spinach pie. Again, it's pretty bland and seems like it came from a grocery store freezer. It isn't actually *bad*...it's just not *good*... so I gave it two stars. There is much better food in Madison.  If you want gyros, go to the Parthenon. If you want spinach pie, go to Med Cafe. If you're on the East side and you're desperate, go to Dimitri's."}
