{"text":"I am so happy there is a place like Phil & Sebastian at the Chinook mall now. What a great place to escape. Once you're inside it doesn't feel like you're at the mall at all. The coffee is lovely. I tried the grilled cheese and wasn't too impressed. It was good but not as good as it seemed like it should have been judging by the quality of everything else inside."}
{"text":"Tried an americano today and I don't quite understand the hype with this place. My first sip tasted burnt but it faded away after a couple more sips. It just felt weak and didn't taste full bodied even though the aromas of shop were heavenly. Will try their drip coffee next time with hopes it being better than the americano."}
{"text":"Great interiors, furniture and fixtures as well as great espresso. The drip coffee was vegetal and fruity and not very good but that is a taste preference.

The issue I had was with the music, heavy heavy indie music with extreme bass and high volume. This is an upscale shop but needs to pay attention to demographic of their customers and the music is not appropriate."}
{"text":"The staff are snobby and have no pep to their step! Could care less that you have to wait for them to start your order. They seem more interested in chatting then helping!
The seating is not comfortable and very cramped."}
{"text":"Wow.  File this experience under you don't know what you don't know until you find it. For coffee lovers, Phil & Sebastian's is pure caffeinated joy matching if not exceeding the quality of Peet's coffee in Seattle.  With three locations in Calgary, this little known gem to the public at large is one destination to try if you appreciate a great cup of java.."}
{"text":"They've made me a coffee snob. So good are their macchiatos and with such care are they prepared, that every other shop I've been to in the city pales in comparison."}
{"text":"Everybody talks about P&S's coffee but it's their sandwiches I really like. For me their marinated lamb sandwich served with tasty potato salad (or coleslaw if you prefer) makes a perfect lunch. Combine that with a freshly made Americano and you can't go wrong. Congrats to P&S for rising high above the usual mall food court fare. 

The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I think that the layout is not ideal. In particular it is awkward to bus your table when there is a crowd waiting for their coffee to turn up. Also the chairs could be more comfortable."}
{"text":"Spot on reviews from Tim, Steven and RM. 

Look no further when you want a company that is deeply invested in their coffee and their clientele! I was first introduced to Phil and Sebastian's at a friends' wedding where they did a pop up coffee shop during the wedding's cocktail hour. It was amazing experience to see the baristas at work and I was so impressed that whenever I was in Calgary, I would convince my husband that we needed to make a pit stop at the Chinook location.

Fast forward to me moving to Mission...and seeing a P and S 5 min walk away? It's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

The only downside to this particular location is there are only three electrical sockets for use...two in the back and one at the front. Make sure you fully charge your laptop if you can't score a spot near a plug :) Or...make friends with the people sitting near them! 

Unparalleled service and fantastic coffee. You're always in for a treat at P&S!"}
{"text":"When people ask me where I like to go for a good coffee, I usually say to them, \"How dare you speak to me?\"

But I still think P&S has the best pour-overs in the city and they sell some pretty sweet and highly rated coffee gear too."}
{"text":"Unparalleled dedication to coffee. From farm to cup, they're involved in all aspects of the coffee you drink. Easily the best coffee shop in the city and one of the best in Canada. 

The new cafe in Mission is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Quite a nice new spot for coffee and light fare. Wife and I had coffee on a nice warm Sunday after a stroll on 4th St.  Coffee and tea very nice and well presented in a carafe on and wood serving platter.  However the place was too warm to be comfortable.  Needs some outdoor seating unfortunately it faces east and has a very small sidewalk area."}
{"text":"I go here for the freshly pressed coffee. Fun to try different beans and watch the barista prepare you cup of heaven."}
{"text":"I love it how they do foam art - even with my hot chocolate! Usually, places do it with milky coffee drinks, but they make most of their drinks pretty here!  I love how they open earlier than the mall too - which makes it accessible!  I am impressed with the quality of their drinks and the care they put into making every single drink for every single customer!  I'm happy coming here - but I like to keep it for a special occasion"}
{"text":"They make an amazing latte, better than anywhere else in the city. Love the atmosphere and the service is great. The only thing is if you haven't been there before, the menu isn't visible. It can be intimidating if you don't know what to order. Also the wifi was pretty shoddy... Had a hard time connecting and had to change seats a couple of times. I'll definitely go back though, the latte alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Overall a very \"well-rounded\" coffee shop! I really love this location as it has such a cozy and warm feeling especially in the winter months. This is my go-to place to meet up with friends for a quick and light lunch or coffee. 

I really appreciate the fact that many of their products are very fresh and delightful! Their lattes are absolutely amazing, as is the fresh squeezed orange juice they sell. The only food I have tried there is their grilled cheese sandwich and that was okay but still very warm and filling. A nice atmosphere with good service, I don't mind paying a little bit extra for the quality and setting of this cafe."}
{"text":"Now that the new Chinook expansion is over, I had to check out the new Phil & Sebastien cafe.  At the Farmers Market location, they had given us a 2 for 1 coffee card to try out this new space which was great and we ordered two Soy Lattes.  There was a huge lineup of people but the baristas worked quickly and efficiently and we had our coffees in no time.  

I think it is so great for a local company to be in Chinook along with all of these great new international retailers they have brought in.  It really shows how Calgarian business owners can achieve success if they put their mind to it.  Congrats to the owners.  After we got our coffees we went and visited the new Urban Outfitters.  Hipster, much? Haha!"}
{"text":"Their tea lattes aren't bad, a little weak for my taste though. But the atmosphere is great and would be great for students trying to study and can still get work done with some chatter going on."}
{"text":"Why is your coffee so good?! 
SO GOOD!!!!! 
The best on the whole Stephen Ave strip. 
Delicious. Amazing. Recommend this coffee everyday."}
{"text":"My favorite Espresso in the city. I've been following these guys since the farmers market days and was elated when they started roasting their own beans! If you've graduated from Char-bucks and want good coffee, Phil & Sebastian are for you"}
{"text":"Several reasons I'd never go back here:

- supposedly they have wifi but it didn't work
- pretty much nowhere to charge a computer 
- coffee was bad but a simple cup of coffee cost $3.50... ridiculous 
- baristas were stuck-up 

Never again."}
{"text":"There isn't really much I can add to this review that hasn't been mentioned already by the Yelp fellowship. Great atmosphere with lots of natural light at the tables, attractive crowd (including Baristas) and the best mocha I have ever had. Never have I come to a mall seeking only coffee, now I will!"}
{"text":"Cortado Review

The Pour:
Very good. Calgary has a vibrant third wave coffee scene, however IMO the natives haven't fully made the transition from Tim Hortons/Starbucks so in general the the roast profile for the city is extremely dark for craft coffee. Just as San Francisco cafes cater to the local preference for super light roast, Calgary shops have to go to the dark side a bit.

That being said, I was lucky enough to get a roast that for them, they considered extremely light, which put it solidly in the medium roast category if you're used to California cafes. It was very tasty.

Service:
Baristas were very friendly and happy to talk about their craft and the local coffee scene.

Ambiance:
Clean and modern, eschewing the rustic hipster aesthetic that is so common in many craft cafes.

Conclusion:
Best that I had (only went to Analog and Monogram) in Calgary - I didn't have a chance to check out Rosso. I only went once, but it was pretty darn good.

About Me / Review Criteria:
-I only check out / review \"Third Wave\"/artisanal/craft coffee shops
-Nobody gets more than 4 stars until I've gone several times
-Reviews can't be based on just a select group of baristas, they all have to be equally skilled, or at least must all have a minimum level of skill
-My star ratings are solely based on the drink, never on food, ambiance, or if the barista is emo or snobby (because that would bring down more than 50% of the shops), although I do mention those in the review
-I don't claim to be a trained coffee connoisseur
-My reviews are generally based on gibraltar/cortados (or cappuccinos), not espresso or drip/pourover coffee"}
{"text":"This is the place for Real Coffee Lovers. The quality of their fine/artisan coffees is awesome!! Even if you are not a coffee lover the food is also excellent... great variety of sandwiches and salads. It was surprising for me to find a coffee shop like this inside a mall where normally all you can find is fast food/drink type of places. Excellent place to hang out with friends to enjoy good coffee and food."}
{"text":"The coffee, lattes, hot chocolate and more.. are delicious! The ambience is modern and pleasant, but the seating is cramped. It is not a place that I would choose to get more then a beverage for take-out. They are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place, I love the quality of their coffee, but I did not love the arrogance of the guy serving us.  My mom and I popped by here for a pick me up before a long drive, and I wanted to pick up some fresh beans to bring back for a friend in BC.  

Our conversation went something like this:

me: \"I think I'll buy some beans too...Which ones do you recommend? What's your favourite roast right now?\"
Guy:  *rolls his eyes a little* \"I mean..I don't know. My favourite one isn't here, I don't think.\"
me: \"Oh,uhh.. okay - which is your favourite?\"
Guy: \"It doesn't matter, I don't think we have it. Well maybe we do over here....\" *walks to a stand and looks for coffee beans* \"No, we don't have it.\" 
Me: Okay..uh.... cool.  Well I guess I'll get this Honduran one...The tasting notes sound pretty good. Do you like this one?\" 
Guy: \"Umm..Sure. They're all good.\"

So helpful, my mind was blown.

I ordered a cortado to stay and although it was delicious it was made with some super sloppy latte art. Not a huge deal, but I think the expectation is definitely there when you go to a cafe like this. 

All in al though - The cafe itself is beautiful and cozy, the food we ordered was delicious, and the coffee was good. Just the service could have use a small finessing."}
{"text":"R M. below is bang on with his review.

The owners and barista pride themselves in serving high quality brew. I love seeing them expand because it shows the appreciation and demand Calgarian's have for good coffee. 

I love this location's interior. Very modern. The wood panelled walls is a nice touch. The barista's provide great service. Be warned, you'll have a hard time snagging a table for party sizes more than 4. 

Did you know that P&S have the 2012 Best Canadian Barista? I had the pleasure of sitting in on one of his coffee tastings. He's very passionate about coffee, and he loves sharing his expertise to everyone.

Tip: Be sure to get their coffee flight (sample of three different roasts).

Skip out on Timmy's and Starbucks. Your palette deserves a real taste of coffee."}
{"text":"My decaf Americano was amazing. And that's saying something, because amazing decaf is hard to find.

My barista was also super friendly and referenced a Hilary Duff song, so 5 stars all around.

Looking forward to checking out their events sometime."}
{"text":"This is everything you want in a west coast style coffee shop. Nice interior to spend a few minutes, friendly servers and good nutty coffee. The entrance is sort of weird because you first have to enter the office building and there is no separate entrance."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this Phil and Sebastians location, I've only been to their Marda Loop location. Gotta say, just as delicious! Food selection isn't that big but that didn't bother me considering how small the location is. I split the roasted turkey sandwich with my sisters which was surprisingly delicious, gourmet!. Our lattes were perfect. I love their beans. Milk texture is a big thing for me too and theirs was perfect. Another great location for P&S!"}
{"text":"By now I've been to the Phil & Sebastian Marda Loop and Chinook Mall locations, obviously I love their coffee, so I guess I'm just rating the experience? :) 

My sister works by this location and she wanted my other sister and I to come check it out, so we met up for a sister coffee date. It wasn't too busy, which is surprising considering it's Phil & Sebastian. 
I love the look of this location! It's a bit different than the other two I've been at. Just as chill though and a great place to study or socialize. 

I got a decaf latte which was pretty good. It's so hard to find a place with good decaf, I was happy. 
What made this an A+ experience though was their matcha!! Oh. my. goodness. Real matcha! I find a lot of cafes sweeten their matcha with syrup or buy pre-sweetened matcha powder. Phil & Sebastian's on the other hand, 100%. 

No complaints here! Try their matcha latte!!"}
{"text":"As I've said in my previous Phil & Sebastian reviews, I'm a fan of the coffee so at this point I'm actually reviewing the cafe. 

I love the layout and feel of this location the best. I think it's the biggest of their locations, lots of space to study or to hangout. I love the hanging plants and I love all the merchandise. 

My only complaint is that my sister's iced chai was waaaaaay too sweet, she couldnt finish it. My cappuccino on the other hand was perfect, as usual."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say... This is seriously the best coffee I've EVER had, and I've travelled the MFing world. These guys have done for coffee what the craft microbrew crowd did for beer... I can't say enough good things about P&S!"}
{"text":"Having been to Bogotá, Colombia, the Mecca of truly authentic coffee numerous times... P&S comes closest to the quality of coffee in country.

Staff are always helpful, friendly and accomodating.   Today was no different! 

Service 5 by 5.
Coffee 5 by 5."}
{"text":"Loved Phil & Sebastian coffee shop. Tried the espresso which was made with the Ethiopian bean, it was excellent. Also tried the Americano and the Panamanian geisha as well which by far is my favorite one. Bought a cool coffee book and mugs as well.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love coffee, but what I really love is good coffee, and you will certainly find good coffee at Phil & Sebastian's. Good coffee comes from confidence, and these guys have it, you know how I know? They don't try to give you 33oz of it to try and mask the fact that their coffee sucks. 

What else can I say? If you are at Chinook, drink Phil & Sebastian's coffee, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I am an addict!  I am addicted to coffee....better yet, I am addicted to P&S coffee!!  Mmmmm their latte is sooooooo delicious.  P&S makes coffee, I mean real coffee.  If you are a real coffee drinker, you would know what I mean.  They sure know how to make a good cup of coffee, it is not sour or not burnt, it is perfect.  Whenever I go to Chinook mall, I have to grab my P&S latte before I shop.  It has become my ritual."}
{"text":"I love coffee, I love the taste, the smell, the jitters it gives me after one too many, the headache caused by one too few.  It is my favorite hot beverage. And that's saying a lot when there is such thing as hot chocolate. I will admit that I'm usually pretty put off by most chain style shops where their joe tends to taste more like battery acid or water dressed in brown. P & S breaks that conception.  Their coffee is rich and complex, their selection reads like a sommelier's wine list, which is as it should be. Selling coffee by \"light\" \"medium\" and \"dark\" is like categorizing wine using only white or red.  And it may just be my imagination, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't just coffee they put in my cup, because I tasted the love too."}
{"text":"3 staff working on Saturday afternoon, the place is at 40% capacity yet I had to remove the dish from the previous patron and wipe my own table down. 

Also, I asked for honey and they don't have any.... mmmm but they are not shy to charge over $3 for a cup of brewed coffee.

Not a good value/experience for the price"}
{"text":"Great!!! I love the meticulous care in making sure that cup of coffee is the best. Down to the special filtered water, to the beans, to the talented baristas."}
{"text":"Service speed would be the same as those chain coffee shops, but I gotta say, they make real coffee!! Very delicious!!! If you love coffee you should try!"}
{"text":"Finally a real Cappuccino!!! Thank the Force! Love it! After searching high and low!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and a pleasant gentleman behind the counter. What a great alternative to Sbux or Second Cup, and in the mall! no less. It's not the best coffee I've ever had, but it's certainly delicious and I very much appreciated the heart balloon in my latté. If they had Almond Milk, I'd give them a 5!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee and atmosphere.  However, I find the service a bit slow and the prices a tad high for the quality."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. Calgary is lucky to have this small coffee chain, with great coffee and which takes pride in the culture of coffee."}
{"text":"I really like to work from this coffee. Their staff and coffee is pretty good plus the environment is usually not very noisy. The only downside for this location is that if you can't get a table by the window and both high tables (which btw doesn't offer a nice view as you face a wall) are occupied then you won't have access to a power outlet."}
{"text":"Delicious iced americano!!! Really enjoyed my drink, and it took no time at all to prepare as well! 10/10 would come back again!"}
{"text":"We love Phil & Sebs coffee, and we're so excited for this new location downtown! Just another little spot to stop in and make your day with delicious drinks, pastries, and entrees from Sidewalk Citizen. They also have in-house made gluten-free donuts that looked amazing! This shop is located inside a bank and has beautiful art installations and comfy seating to enjoy with your coffee. The other minor downside is that as of now they don't offer a manual brew. Despite that, their brewed coffee was fantastic. They had two types to offer and both were delightful. Always a great decision to stop in!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee and croissant! I found it to be one of the one places open while exploring on a Sunday. Friendly staff and cute environment."}
{"text":"Great place in Mission to either get (a) take-out coffee, or (b) sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Really good drip-coffee, and really good sourdough sandwiches. Patio gets the sun in the summer - Take a book, sip coffee, and enjoy 4th Street."}
{"text":"I love Phil & Sebastian and this location is no different. Great space, great flow. I always get a cappuccino. Croissants are delicious. I had a breakfast sandwich once which was actually really good! Always a bonus when a shop serves sparkling water with their espresso drinks"}
{"text":"My favourite coffee shop in town, by far. 

Don't come expecting a Starbucks menu, or a greasy-spoon diner cup of coffee. Phil & Sebastian's is a coffee bar that takes pride in its drinks, and you get what you pay for. 

This particular location has the best atmosphere and staff of any location in the city - everyone is always very friendly, and  my drinks have always come out perfect. It also seems to attract a different crowd than on Marda Loop, and never feels as cramped, either.

 Also? They serve beer and wine. 

There's not much more to say about this place except that it's a must-try for anybody who likes good coffee. For the people writing poor reviews about P&S? There's a Starbucks within seconds of the front door - quit complaining and go find a place you'll actually appreciate."}
{"text":"bar none the best coffee I have had in calgary is at any phil and sebastians. I love their dedication to honest business with fair trade coffee growers and distributors etc... Every one in my office loves them too..."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome coffee in the heart of Calgary! Will definitely be back the next time I visit. The interior of the cafe looks great, staff are really friendly and great coffee. What more can U ask from a cafe :) kinda slightly bummed cold brew was sold out when I was there in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"I've been to Phil & Sebastian's locations in Marda Loop, Mission and Chinook.  I think their coffee is good, but I really dislike that they don't have more lactose- or soy-free options for milk - whether Lactaid, almond or coconut milk.  I will honestly go to other coffee shops if given the choice just because I avoid milk products as much as possible, and don't consume any soy."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious cafe mocha! Nice vibe in there, I think you have to be a hipster to work there though."}
{"text":"Some things just shouldn't go together. For example, Dinosaurs & Rollerskates or Cats & Lazers.

And until recently I would have put the third-wave coffee movement and your atypical super mall. That was until I went to the newest Phil & Sebastian Coffee Roasters buried deep within Chinook Centre.

This new P&S location is the same great coffee you expect from their previous two locations (in Marda Loop & The Farmers Market), but with an interesting twist. Well it's not really a twist, but rather a different philosophy which makes this coffee shop such a hidden gem. 

Most shopping centre coffee shops are designed to churn out a steady stream of customers. You know get you on your way as navigate the treacherous halls. But, P&S is the opposite. It's main focus is the coffee and the coffee experience. A brewed cup takes about 3 minutes to brew and after a busy afternoon of shopping, the mandatory break is a welcomed relief from the constant stress of shopping. 

This is a really treat and if you're already a fan of the other shops, you're going to love this. I know it's a mandatory stop for me whenever I visit Chinook now."}
{"text":"Pros:
Amazing coffee, made by really nice barista men.
Nice Decor.

Cons:
'Lifestyle' prices. Okay, eyewatering prices.

Look folks, I get that P+S allegedly use really good coffee, and that they make them really nice, perhaps they pay the staff a bit more, perhaps they have high overheads.

It's a place designed to sell to the demographic its designed for. People with lots of cash sloshing around. That aint me. I like good value. And Im sorry, but a cup of coffee for over $6 aint it. At the same time, at the other end of the spectrum of coffee, Timmies isn't my bag either. Its a bland, crowd pleaser, inoffensive and generic. For mass market drip coffee, A&W, McDonalds and 7/11 is good for a 'cuppa Joe'. I digress.

I get that companies need to make a profit. But that over 5 buck level? It's just a psychological barrier I just cant get over. It excludes a major portion of the consumer. This isn't Holt Renfrew people, its a freekin coffee shop.

For a once in a while treat sure, or even if they made an option for us poorer folks, say, a more affordable drip coffee option for say $2.50 a cup, and disable the wifi to stop annoying macbook hipsters clogging up the place, then id go there. Thats what knocks a 2 stars off it.

I'm sure P+S could afford to trim the margin and sell a cup of joe for $2 - 2.50, and keep the skinny almond latte frappe cappuchino moccachino al pachino crap priced high for the oil&gas employee yuppie yoga girls and mac book hipsters. Keep two camps happy.

Until then? Too rich for my blood, sorry Seb and Phil."}
{"text":"The decor is simple yet beautiful. A lot of tables with comfy chairs near plug-ins, perfect for studying. However, I'm not a fan of their drinks. I've tried their mocha: too acidic, barely taste the chocolate; matcha latte: barely any matcha flavour, overshadowed by the milk, and no sweetness. I hoped the hot chocolate would be better yet I was disappointed again: it smelled great but the milk overshadowed it again. I could barely taste the chocolate. 

I haven't been to the other locations so I don't know if the quality carries--hopefully not. Here's to ordering expensive tea from now on if I come here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't visited this Phil & Seb location before, great little seating areas for working, we were able to buckle down and get a whole days work out of the way, there's free wifi (look at the board above the coffee machines for the password), enjoyed a delicious latte and the always wonderful sidewalk citizen bread with preserves for breakfast. So good! I preserves were a bit runny/hard to spread but otherwise very tasty. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack they had playing while I was working."}
{"text":"I've fallen head-over-heels in love with Phil&Seb coffee. I did a 10-day sugar fast earlier this year and discovered that all coffee is not created equal. And P&S is absolutely perfect the way it is.

This location is always very fast & efficient. The people who work here are friendly and informative. I never have a problem getting a table if I'm planning on staying a little while.

My only complain is that it's at Chinook Centre - and I hate the mall. Hence why 4 stars. :/

(3/30)"}
{"text":"I'm going to let you in on a secret. During my last year of undergrad (not that long ago), writing paper after paper after paper and spending multiple all-nighters at the Taylor Family Digital Library (at the UofC), the only thing that kept me going were the Phil & Sebastian's soy lattes I bought religiously at Fuel for Gold. My brain juice, I called it.

So to say I'm a little biased in this review is an understatement. I owe these guys my degree, ya know?

But all kidding aside, I am extremely happy that P&S has branched out of Marda Loop and the Calgary Farmer's Market -- even IF this particular location is at the mall. It does get a little busy, especially during the weekends, but I've found their cozy seating space particularly conducive to study sessions or meeting people on weekdays between 12-4. I mean if you have to be at the mall anyway... right?

The coffee is great. The lattes in particular are a treat; I have the anti-sweet tooth so I really appreciate how authentically delicious it is, unsweetened and all."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide on the delicious latte or the dulce - latte sweetened with caramel condensed milk. But I settled on the latte just because I was already eating sweets. 

The latte had a great caffeine punch. Bold but smooth, not over powering at all. I can drink this like water. In fact I got the large and I was done in 5 minutes. This is dangerous. 

Lots of plugins here and free wifi! Though it's pretty busy and noisy so not very good to get work done unless you can tune out noise. 

They have three kinds of muffin and croissant to eat, or lunch specials. I didn't get a chance to try the food so I'll make sure I come back soon to try it out!"}
{"text":"I fail to see the hype about this coffee shop and its coffee roasts. I've given it three or more tries and I have not been blown away by their coffee. Also, I find the service really deplorable. Not a smile to be found at the cashier. When asked about what they suggest they don't give you much in terms of opinion. When your coffee is done they call out your order and that's it. No thank you. No smile once again. I'll just stick to Starbucks, thanks."}
{"text":"Their featured salad had this awful dressing...I think it was just vinegar. It looked so good and then the ingredients were ruined by the vile vinegar dressing. Disappointing. So don't get their salads, but the coffee was decent."}
{"text":"We are no strangers to Phil & Sebastian Coffee thanks to their coffee shops in Marda Loop and at the old Currie Barracks Farmer's Market.  Due to the parking situation at Chinook Mall we do not visit this mall very often because I'd rather dye my hair blue then fight the traffic in the parking lot.  But when we do P&S is at the top of the list for a hit of java.  

I love the layout of this little place with tables around the corner and always a spot to sit if you have been busy shopping and want to take a load off and rest your feet for a few.  It is kind of narrow and when busy can get congested.  It's almost a best kept secret in this mall.

The coffee is good and the service spectacular.  We enjoy the coffee art that accompanies the coffees, it's a nice little touch that thrills the kids.  

I also think it's great that Phil & Sebastian offer coffee classes and I would love to take a class one day."}
{"text":"You can get the feeling of going to a family owned, small cafe around the corner, although Phil & Sebastian has branches in different parts of town, and technically would be considered a \"chain\" :)

We go there whenver we have a guest from out of town and want to impress them by showing off something that is not a big Franchise coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Going to the mall one expects to see your run-of-the-mill Starbucks and other underwhelming food/drink. So finding a local/fun/neat cafe in Chinook was a great surprise.  

They roast and pull some fine coffees, and the guy who was helping me choose a bag of beans to take home was really knowledgable about the roasts and the flavour profiles. Not that I understood everything, but he seemed really into the coffee which got me really jazzed.

First time I heard the named-after-those-cool-calgarian-dudes name of the cafe I thought: Disney. I think it's 'cause in my brain it goes: \"Phil & Sebastian\" to \"Belle & Sebastian\" to \"Beauty & the Beast\"...anyways I digress.  Also, the ampersand logo is pretty hipster-tastic."}
{"text":"The coffee tastes great but the service is lousy. Yes, the coffee is really good but service is so important when you are a service based business, right?
It is not a feel good coffee shop. The staff are pretentious and snooty. And that includes the manager who stared at me blankly and spoke monotonely while taking my order and money.
     It was actually creepy. 
There has to be a more service friendly place in Calgary.  Oh right, it is called Starbucks."}
{"text":"I've never seen a Third Wave Coffee shop inside a mall -- brilliant!

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I'm spoiled by having ridiculously incredible coffee like Blue Bottle, Ritual, Barefoot etc so when I visit the in-laws here in Calgary I'm always on the hunt for good coffee. 

Phil & Sebastian so far is the best coffee I've found in Calgary. These guys clearly are from the Third Wave Coffee ilk and uphold that tradition with excellence. My first experience with P&S was at the Calgary Farmer's Market and from that point it was clear that these guys knew what they were doing.

Let's do the technical details run down:

- Locally roasted coffee beans: 
Check. They have their own roaster in Calgary
- Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso
Check. They are pulling excellent espresso from bottomless portafilters
- Microfoam quality and Latte Art:
Check. Excellent microfoam and spot on latte art. See the photo of the cap I uploaded for proof!"}
{"text":"First, I'm going to start by telling you I'm a huge P&S fan.
3 stars is horrendous coming from a so proclaimed \"huge fan.\"
I love the Marda Loop location, and I love that they do a Holt pop up so I can have them while I work too. 
But on a few recent visits to the Chinook location, I've been rethinking about this love affair. Let's break down the points:
-I have yet to have a stellar cup of coffee that didn't taste.........burnt.
-I appreciate the time the barista takes to make a latte leaf.....but in the rush of things it usually looks like the abstract version of the norm.
-They are constantly out of grilled cheese around dinner time.
-Why serve salad if it's going to be one bite worth, crammed in a ketchup cup?
-Why is the front cash girl so grumpy? (Maybe this is specific to me, maybe she hates me). 

One thing that is completely out of their control: STROLLERS. omg it's crowded enough as it is in that small space, why are there so many strollers?! Getting nipped in the ankle by some angry mother is bad enough as it is, it's like this place is a trap for angry moms to take their anger out on people. 

I will endorse the business philosophy and the ideological vessel that makes this business a great success, but I really can't deal with another visit to this location. Too much disappointment here.

Review #2 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a building without a great coffee shop. This building was known to all in the land of Calgary as Chinook Centre. But thankfully, the knights Phil & Sebastian came to the aid of the people of Calgary and opened their magical bean place in the new wing of this mall.

A mall is the last place I ever expected to find good coffee. So imagine my delight when I happened upon Phil & Sebastian's. The same considerate and concise care goes into your cup here as it does in their other locations. 

This is the kind of coffee you keep cream and sugar out of. It's too delicious for that. I had a cup from the beans brought in from the Ibrahim Property. As always, I enjoyed every last drop.

Try out their Quinoa salad too if you're looking for a snack."}
{"text":"Always consistently prepared bevies.  It's by far the best espresso macchiato that continues to grace my lips and transcends me into a land of delightful unicorns and care bears.  Every time. 
And I unhook my demi tasse from the clasp of my purse to use as the vessel that contains the elixir.   That's how serious I am about unicorns and carebears. I mean delectable, transcendent coffee."}
{"text":"From the coffee to the atmosphere, this is a world class establishment. Whenever I am in Calgary I race to this location. Smooth beans, impeccable store design, this is the spot for a cup of joe in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have said it before and I'll tell anyone who listens... again.

Phil & Sebastian makes the best cup of coffee in Calgary!

Feel free to check out my review of their other location on 33rd Avenue SW (Marda Loop) for further details...
The original location at the Calgary Farmers Market remains my favourite - it was so inconspicuously delicious.

This location is also awesome - next to Sears on the North Side of the new expansion at Chinook Mall.
Have you seen the new expansion?  It is rather fabulous.  Armani, Michael Kors, Kiehl's, Judith & Charles to name a few.  P&S fits in perfectly with high-end latte art and five-star clover coffee.

* Free Parking, and easy access for commuters
* Lots of Seats, a very comfortable cafe experience
* Free WiFi, the password is usually an 8 syllable coffee name, just ask :)
* Groovy Staff
* Don't get me started on the coffee... IT'S THE BEST! IN CALGARY!

Craving Couture? Hit Chinook Mall.
Craving Coffee? Stop by P&S.

{"text":"I heard so much hype about the lattes here, but was a little underwhelmed when I finally got around to trying it. I got the matcha latte with almond milk and it came in a super cute mug with some latte art on top. The latte itself tasted like frothy, bitter hot water, to be honest. Maybe I shouldn't have substituted the milk? 

The space is super cute and the small desserts looked delicious, so I'll probably be back if I'm in the area and need to get some work done."}
{"text":"Boho central! They got beans and bean bags! 

Great, great coffee here! One of the top 5 in the city I would say. I remember when they opened the very first shop at the former currie barracks farmers market. It was an instant hit! Everyone from fireman to hipsters and loads of moms and pregnant ladies lined up for a sip. Back then a couple of times i remember waiting at least 17 minutes before i made it through the line to take my order and you know what? it was worth the wait! but funny enough with their expansion (especially this chinook location) they haven't improved the timing(per capita) in fact i would say it has gotten worse.

Coming here at least 7 times in the last year i seem to relive the following experience... Hit the line, only 2 people in front of me, THEN i place my order. I watch the barista closely and anticipate my great tasting and pretty looking latte. I watch the baristas and they are literally doing nothing, just talking... I wait, and wait and finally they stop and start making my drink  and like 7 minutes later i finally get it... This has happened 3 times so far and although I am normally quite patient, it kind of pisses me off! 

so 4 stars it is, could have been a five. I suppose since youre not cooperate and you use higher quality beans you have an excuse to take 3 minutes extra....

{"text":"While I really enjoyed Phil&Sebastian's old location in the farmers market, it seems as though they have made this little nook in Chinook Mall their own. 
I have to say, I am more of a tea person myself, and almost feel intimidated into liking Phil&Sebastians by coffee people so not to be ridiculed. I have had their drip coffee before and enjoyed it. I have also tried one of their infamous lattes, and they use my favourite kind of soymilk, the texture of the soy lending itself well to latte art. 
Not too long ago, I stopped in with a friend, and she purchased me a cup of tea. I was happy to see that they were using an actual steeping device with loose leaf, like many other specialty tea shops use for tea to go. I personally am not a fan of these devices as they are plastic, and often carelessly cleaned at establishments I've seen in the past. However, my tea came out tasting okay, and it was worth waiting a couple minutes as opposed to being served bagged tea. 
I would rather be sipping on said tea while shopping for potatoes and brussel sprouts at the aforementioed old farmer's market than Chinook Mall, but I guess I can consider this a place to hide and read if I am ever dragged to Chinook. It's quieter. Perhaps the Starbucks yuppies haven't caught on yet."}
{"text":"Best local spot for coffee in Calgary!  Must visit for a quiet spot to work or pick up some coffee to bring home."}
{"text":"Best Soy Decaf Latte. 
Consistently great coffee. This is my go to for my fave drink a soy decaf latte. I love the little selection of gluten free snacks and desserts. Try the caramel alfahore - it's super crumbly so watch as you eat it. 
The only downside is the price but you pay for quality which is why I alway go back."}
{"text":"What Chinook Center was missing was a great coffee place focused on the coffee. Second Cup, Starbucks - all about bottom dollar! P&S is all about the coffee, and when you are used to waiting about 12 seconds for your drink from Starbucks, it is refreshing to wait 3 or 4 minutes for your drink here. My favorite is the latte, probably the best I've had in the city. The inside of the place is also great: they have a large glass wall that lets in tons of light - very nice when you get a cup and spend your break reading, listening to the music (which is most often D'Angelo's \"Voodoo\", so many bonus points from me). The staff are friendly and personable, and if you work in the mall, you even get a discount!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and decent food. The large windows are great for people watching, and it's in a very central location. The only downside is that there is limited seating, but they did their best with the space that they have. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great coffee and good ambience!!.. They make the coffee with a beautiful presentation.. And the coffee is very good.. Is a nice place to have a coffee with friends in the middle of the afternoon, or in the weekends mornings..."}
{"text":"As usual, both drinks i got were great. The soup (carrot of some kind) was great. Nicer staff but music that is too loud means they stay at 4 stars."}
{"text":"When they say this place has the best coffee in Calgary, I believe it. We came here in the afternoon because it was the closest cafe to our hotel. 

I don't really love matcha but this place really nails it. And the boy ordered a dulce latte. We both loved our drinks and the mushroom soup was SO AMAZING. You need to check this place out if you're looking for good service, great coffee, and flavourful food."}
{"text":"The good:
It's good. Not great. Not epic. But good. 

The bad:
They're a little snobby.

The ugly:
The prices."}
{"text":"Great coffee, not the best spot to work/study. I really like Phil and Sebastian's but this location has tables that are too tall to work or study. It makes spending a couple hours here uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My 3 year old son and I went into Phil and Sebastian's today while walking downtown. He needed to use the bathroom and I wanted to get a coffee. We asked one of the male employees where the washroom was and he told me it was only for customers. I had been planning on getting a coffee and a snack after the washroom so I asked if my 3yo could use the washroom first. He looked at me and clearly looked annoyed that I was asking and rolled his eyes and said fine. I said never mind, it's clearly a
Problem for him to help us so we would just carry on. Luckily for me, I'm also an ATB employee so I went next door to the ATB, whipped out my employee ID and and one of the bankers let us into the joint bathroom that they share with P&S. So thanks to them for not making a 3yo embarrass himself!"}
{"text":"Ever since the days of the Farmer's Market, I have always been a fan of Phil & Sebastian.

The coffee is good! Not the best, but fairly high on the list.

The food is EXCELLENT! I often think about the grilled cheese sandwich. AND the smoked ketchup that comes along with it. I have long been of the opinion that no one can do ketchup better than Heinz, so why even bother ... but P&S actually makes one that comes CLOSE to being on par. Definite points for originality and flavour.

The downside of Phil & Sebastian's is the vibe.
I don't think it's the fault of the staff ... I think it is just something about the whole place!
You can't help feel like you are being a little bit excluded from the \"cool club\" when hanging around this establishment. 
You can feel the panic, like a dirty stain on a bright white shirt, that somehow they are going to find out that you've been to a Starbucks before! You don't know how, but you feel that they are secretly probing you to see if you match-up to the status quo of hipster coffee credentials!

Ultimately this discomfort results, personally, in not really wanting to hang around. So everything about the place is great! ... only I don't often feel comfortable enough to want to drop by."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. It won't be my last. I need to try it at least one more time before coming to a firm decision. I arrived and was quickly greeted. As I looked over the menu above the cashier, I was directed to the tiny printed menu they had posted for their other brewed coffee options. From what I read on their website, different coffees get different brewing methods. That's awesome in my book! I love my coffee toys! Unfortunately I wasn't able to try one of their other coffees. None of them appealed to my taste. So I went with good old drip coffee. It is a good test. If you can't make a basic coffee, how can you make something more involved? Right?
I asked for it in a mug and to my delight, they heated up the mug before pouring the coffee. Asked if I needed room for cream and handed me my coffee. As I took my first sip to test it out before I polluted it with anything I did find it a little cooler than I would have liked. Aside from that, I was impressed. Not overly bold, or \"too strong\", I sipped and discovered a very well balanced coffee. It did need a little more body so I snuck some cream into it, but it's a very acceptable coffee to drink black. 
I settled into a seat at the bar height counter facing the wall. Not my favourite place to sit anywhere, but all the tables were full. The ambiance was perfect. Comfortable, warm, music that doesn't make your ears bleed. All big components of a successful coffee house in my books. As I sipped away, people have come and gone. I have my back to the walkway between the counter and seating area and not once got beat up by bags, purses and strollers. That really makes a difference! Giving up valuable square footage for customer comfort says a lot. 
If my next visit is even close to this one, I could see myself becoming a very devout follower."}
{"text":"This place is straight up fantastic. So happy that this great little place is tucked away in Chinook mall - finally a good starbucks alternative!! The coffee takes a little longer than usual, but that is because it's better - they brew it by the cup, so it's not your usual drip coffee, and their lattes are amazing as well. I especially recommend the Manjari Mocha - it's not too sweet, but has the most amazing chocolately aftertaste. And the grilled cheese is a must-have, it's the cheapest sandwich there but also my favourite. The staff is also fantastic, super nice and remember customer faces! Highly recommended."}
