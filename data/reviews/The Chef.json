{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and decor is exceptionally nice for Albemarle Rd. The service was average. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Reasonably priced. It is supposed to be a Mexican Restaurant. Both salsas that came out were extremely mild and didn't have an appealing flavor, let alone a mexican food flavor. I got chicken tacos. There was no marinade or sauce or spicy flavor at all. It was essentially some grilled chicken with some lettuce and onions. In short all of the food was bland and plain,  This really wasn't impressive Mexican food at all. Not in general and particularly not in east Charlotte where fantastic authentic Mexican food is available on every block.  I hope it is because it is a newer restaurant. The owner is very nice and the business is very clean. As it stands now, much better options for Mexican food are abundant."}
{"text":"My experience was not the best....my garden salad was full of spring mix lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and fruit.  I like fruit in my salad, but unfortunately my fruit wasn't fresh.  Otherwise a good concept.  I also had the wings which I had no idea was $9.50 for 6 frozen breaded chicken wings I get at the grocery store!!!! What a rip off! To top it off we also had fried chicken which was the special, it was tasteless and well cover cooked. The fettuccine Alfredo was average... Probably your best bet is a pasta dish"}
{"text":"I cant even call it a restaurant! The third, excruciating and last time ever I visited this place was about 3 weeks ago. I ordered the \"calamari\", after about 30 mins (mind you, we were the only 4 customers there) I was presented a plate with what seemed smashed chicken tenders mixed with bits of calamari tentacles. Hard as rocks, cold as ice and didnt even smell like chicken or calamari! Worst place to grab something to \"eat\" ever!!"}
