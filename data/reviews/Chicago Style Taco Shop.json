{"text":"THE EXPERIENCE: So we went in yesterday not knowing it was a school fundraising night. We decided to order anyways even though it was a madhouse inside, there were only about 5 people ahead of us ordering so we took our chance. We stood in line and didn't get to order our food for another 30 minutes. We figured hey, it's busy we understand. We came in knowing that so no ones fault but ours . But to get our food?? It took them an hour and a half. We were there a total of 2 hours which I did not expect. I saw people actually leave and cancel their order because I'm sure they weren't getting their food for a long lonnnngggg while. I really do appreciate the cashier apologizing and letting us know when our food was coming but we came in during the daylight and left when it was night out. I've never ever waited that long for food in my life. I'm sure it's less crazy here other days, but yesterday was a complete mess, and I would suggest them to hire more cooks and one more cashier to get the food out faster, especially if they are going to agree to host a school fundraiser.   THE FOOD: I ordered the salted steak tacos which were ok. Although they didn't give me any limes for it, just the salsa, it tasted ok. Probably wouldn't order it again. My husband ordered the salted steak burrito, that wasn't good at all. He said he wouldn't order that again. But we both said that we would come back to try other tacos.   Overall, we both agreed to come back and try some more tacos. But never ever again like last night. I'll be calling my order in ahead of time just to be safe."}
{"text":"Good food made fresh and unique.  We ordered some tortas, tacos, and the Windy City fries loaded.  This place is worth the drive.  Prices are reasonable.  The food rocks!  Best barbacoa and al pastor in Vegas.  Support this joint!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos. Filled with large amount of meats. Good hot sauces available. My wife's quesadilla was enormous and tasty. Small place. Good service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Hidden gem for sure. The staff and service were great. Hit them up for sure!!@ about to go back right now."}
{"text":"So we found this place by coincidence and let me tell you, I couldn't be more happy about it! The barbacoa is so delicious! We've tried a bunch of different tacos and we've been surrounded with how good everything is! The service is really great too! We ordered or meals and at the end they gave us a free taco!!! Which is amazing considering how delicious they were! I highly recommend this place if you want real authentic Mexican flavors!  PS. The prices are great too!  Got a whole meal with soda and all for less than $10"}
{"text":"Wow..I can't say enough about this place. Found it on yelp and gave it a shot...a new regular customer here.   Whether is the chorizo windy city fries tacos Pollo everything is awesome here..even their horchata.   This place is by far the best mexican food I have had in las vegas, my wife being Hispanic agrees.  I haven't even had Mexican food this good in bigger restaurant chains.  Prices are awesome I mean, there isn't enough praise I could give this place.   It's a little hidden but look for the northern Vistas business center next to Toro taxes and it's just next door.    Worth the trip and will definitely be returning. Far better than Robertos, pepes, and tacos Los gordos...  wow."}
{"text":"First time customer . Tried them at Findlay Food Truck Frenzy. The tacos are delicious . The owners are so friendly !!! Can't wait to go to their store location to try more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"Most authentic and delicious taco shop in Vegas!!! They treat every customer as family. On top of our list as one of our favorites. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"First time in, and last time. As I'm ordering, the cook (owner) and the cashier leave me at the register to go talk to a friend/family member. The cashier literally walked away in the middle of taking my order."}
{"text":"Windy City Fries with Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese, Carne Asada - Amazing! Burrito huge! Very friendly staff, quick and Fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food. Barbacoa is bomb, so tender it melts in your mouth. I'm a taco and torta kinda girl but going in for the windy city fries next. Cool little spot where the customer service is good."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem.  First off, the service is excellent.  The woman who helped us was friendly, welcoming, and had no problem answering any questions we had.  Joe (not sure if spelled right) the owner welcomed us as we walked in and even though he was sitting down taking a break and enjoying his own meal, he went out of his way to introduce himself and get to know us.   As for the food, it was freakin delish!  We weren't aware of what \"Chicago style\" actually meant, but there is definitely a huge difference in flavor when compared to other taco places.  I ordered the chicken taco salad and my boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito.  The chicken was shredded just perfect and consistently, and they were over-generous on the amount of meat in each meal.  They place 3 variations of hot sauces at your table which all were distinct and flavorful.  The portion was large enough to where we each took home leftovers for another meal later on.   The restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating.  Parking wasn't a problem as it is connected to a plaza of other small businesses.  This will definitely be our go-to spot!"}
{"text":"clean restaurant and friendly staff. Food prepared in front of you.  Tacos were good but a little dry. They do double tortilla Which is nice. Most places do a normal size tortilla.  I will be back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Found through Yelp tonight while trying to figure out where to eat with my boyfriend & we decided on this place, no regrets :) he got the chicken Windy City fries & I got the shredded beef ones, both super good but I gotta say the chicken was amazing! definitely will be coming back at some point. The owner asked where we found them since he asked if it was our first time & even offered us a taco on the house to try out & that was great also! It was chorizo meat, superb. Thanks for the good experience!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Windy City fries are the bomb.  Friendly and hard working staff.  My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  You must try it.  Everything is made fresh once you place your order.  Really worth the drive. Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Food was great, very friendly staff (pretty sure it's the owner that is there the last couple of times I went there.  My only issue is that a gal was sweeping up the dining area, and instead of whisking the dirt and debris into a dust pan and throwing it away, she swept everything out the door.    This valley is already dirty enough without adding to it, and if this is the way they clean, well just kind of makes me wonder about the kitchen.."}
{"text":"Damn good chile relleno tacos. Best I've had. All the food is good and pretty cheap for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world good! Would highly recommend!  Excellent food, excellent service! I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great food  Large portions! We got a taco and a windy fries to share and it was too big!   Friendly service  Great smell and taste.  Perfect for your Mexican cravings"}
{"text":"Walked in and employee was eating never washed her hands to wait on us. Went to use the restroom it's filthy. So filthy and grossed out to even use it! Didn't have food that was on menu and only one cook for all of restaurant. Tacos are $2 and comes with hardly any meat!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch got  the carnitas taco combo and chicken taco combo. Tacos street style great! Rice and refried beans need some work. Over all I'll go back"}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best asada tacos ever!!!!!!! Next time I will order them with an avocado slice on top though cause avocado always makes anything better. Definitely go!!!! I also tried my mans asada quesadilla which was really good too! Came with sour cream, lettuce tomato, and avocado!"}
{"text":"The Windy City fries were delicious! Also the horchata was made from scratch and also bomb! Owner was a pleasure to talk to and the customer service was on point!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, but definitely not the last!  The pastor tacos were delish!! Really friendly staff, clean, good prices, and fresh made to order food.  The owner actually came out and talked to us while we were waiting for our order, really nice guy.  We've been looking for a good taco spot since we moved here a few months ago and we've found it!  I plan to try the Windy City fries next."}
{"text":"First time here. Baller tacos and killer salsa! Very friendly staff. I'm definitely coming back. They have a 4 different taco sauces that are all excellent. Everything is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Great spot! Friendly atmosphere and clean. Guy behind the counter offered me a free taco to try while I waited. This is a fresh change from Robertos."}
{"text":"Great food, quick and friendly service.  Two NLVPD cops came in and seemed like they were regulars.  My theory is if you want to know where to go for the best lunch place; ask a cop, cable guy, or a mailman.  If you get the Windy City Fries, get it with mozzarella, it's bomb!"}
{"text":"The owners are nice , meat was fresh , speedy service, prices are good , and food is deeeeLish .... the red salsa omg  I just wanna take a bucket of it home spread it all over my bed and roll around in it ! Lmao jk but seriously it is the bomb!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Delicious food that is fresh, and perfectly seasoned! We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"This place is good for its windy city fries. It was my first time trying it out, ordered 3 taco combo burrito combo and the fries. I was disappointed with everything but yhe fries. Even the presentation was better for the fries than everything else."}
{"text":"This might be one of the best taco shops I've been to out here in Vegas. The workers are friendly and the food is great. Everything taste fresh and they take their time making your food look and taste good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best taco shop in Vegas! You have to try the Carne Asada Fries. Better than Roberto's hands down!!! The owner is great and so is the food."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this restaurant. I order a carne asada burrito. It was delicious. But the side of fries wasn't  good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this joint ,The food is absolutely delicious . Wife always gets cecina , kids get chicken and I get the steak. Getting anything from tacos to nachos , Food is always good and the salsa choices are limited lately . The drinks need more variety also . Overall a promising taco shop depending on how it's managed . Keep up the good cooking"}
{"text":"Off the chain pastor tacos for lunch or dinner......... Super clean establishment.....Tortas was awesome and the. Horchata was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is place makes good food. The Windy City fries are bomb. Nachos are huge and will fill you up. Tacos are good. Customer service is great. We got to sample meats and even got a free taco."}
{"text":"I've eaten a torta de carne asada here 5 times. I always call in my order, so it will be ready when I arrive. They are always friendly and the tortas are awesome. I will update when I try other menu items."}
{"text":"I tried the Barbacoa and the al pastor tacos and both were delicious. Their Windy City fries are tasty and filling. I'll definitely be back to try more from their menu.  The folks serving you are very friendly. This is a great place to grab some tacos."}
{"text":"Great food and owners. Affordable prices as well. Will be back!Steak fries were yummy and a good size."}
{"text":"Not because I'm from Chicago but..the Windy City fries are Bomb !!!!! The tacos and even the tortilla is the best. Such friendly people too. Will be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"First time to chicagos taco shop. Clean. Cool interior style. Good food. I recommmend the fries with all the toppings. Imagine nachos but with fries instead of chips. Tacos good as well"}
{"text":"We got tacos (fish, steak, chicken, pastor) and guacamole. The tacos were all perfect. The guacamole needed salt and lime juice. The service was great. The salsas were also great. Also the beans and rice were great. It was all pretty great except for the guac and I think that might be kind of a personal preference thing so 5 stars.  Also the tacos are pretty small. I could probably eat 6 but I'm really into tacos. I'm going to go here again and do that."}
{"text":"The food is great. Took the kids and they loved it too. Must try the tacos. The tortillas really make them different and so good! Burritos were great also! Owner is so nice. We will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Obviously this place has new owners. I am very disappointed. My husband and I came in to grab food to go. Literally we ordered Asada Fries and two drinks, it cost us $17.29!  Not only was the price outrageous the wait was forever. There were two tickets ahead of us and it took over 30 minutes for some fries!  I had to double check the menu for the prices, windy city fries are $12!  So we got to our destination (less than a mile away). All the cheese sunk to the bottom and the fries were tasteless.   I will never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos must try nachos are super good, great staff and friendly  you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"So so amazing. We tried barbacoa, pastor, and asada tacos. Also the nachos were good. All very flavorful and tender. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that my friend and I basically live here, and we are not ashamed to admit it.  Chicago style tacos is frickin' awesome *said in my horrible little Nicky voice.... Because my friend is vegan and gluten free, not by choice so I guess I'll keep her, we Googled away looking for places close to us to grab a bite. Success!!!! This place pops up. We called in and confirmed that they did have vegan options so off we went. I got pastor windy city fries, and she got the vegan taco.....Holy guacamole. Everything was delicious. Praying to the taco Gods that the first experience wasn't a fluke, we continued to visit frequently. The staff is fantastic and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Chicago style taco shop is beyond delicious there barbacoa tacos and al pastor quesadillas are to die for will be back!"}
{"text":"I liked the food enough to go back and try something other than the carne asada. My favorite was the carne asada fries, they use crispy crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco shop in Vegas!  I drive 30+ minutes to get some of their Chicago style Mexican food....great prices, great food!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something more than a Mexican fast food restaurant and my coworker and i found this excellent place, many choices, fresh cook food plus great taste and really good cuatomer service ."}
{"text":"The customer service was outstanding. The woman was real patient with my complex and difficult order. The tacos were all separated to our liking. She also mentioned to us the drinks were fresh and they were delicious! Our tacos were delicious as well! Love this place and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the staff was warm upon entering. Pricing was a bit more than what I'm used to for tacos but they more than made up for it with flavor."}
{"text":"I ordered asada and carnita tacos. It was delicious my husband a I really enjoyed it. Great job guys keep it up!! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food, I love the tacos but the Chicago Fries (chorizo) are my favorite! This place is a little hard to find especially if you're like most speeding down Craig road. Slow down and stop in for some Chicago fries, one bite and you'll wonder why you were in such a hurry."}
{"text":"Wow this place has amazing food the meats are delicious and so cheap $8.50 for 3 tacos rice,beans and a drink come check this place out"}
{"text":"Menu is somewhat small. Staff is very friendly. Has like a southern latin vibe. Food was just ok not the best I have ever eaten maybe a 4 and that's pushing it lol. Quantity was pretty big I got the Windy City fries. I will be giving a five star because of service not the food although this place is a must try. Will I come back? I would say yes because of the cashier viery nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I looked up tacos and saw the stars rating of this tiny gem and decided to give it a try. And I wasn't wrong.small nice place,simple menu but definitely worth it. I tried the windy city fries,and a burrito de cecina.muy delicioso! freshly made, good size portions. Definitely coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Staff greetings as soon as you walk in the door. The atmosphere is calm and welcoming. The place smells delicious. Can't wait to try out these Windy City fries."}
{"text":"Seriously, trust these awesome reviews. There may only be 20 but they deserve to have 1000 more. It was a little hard to find because being brand new and all they still don't have a big lit up sign, but was worth the u-turns. I got the chorizo breakfast burrito and a quesadilla. Both were super delicious and not the slightest bit greasy (which was pleasantly surprising). As for the green mild sauce, I wish I could cover my life in it. The staff was super friendly and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ate here last night after reading the reviews on yelp. We ordered the small Windy City fries, a breakfast burrito, a small quesadilla, and the tacos. The staff was super friendly and inviting. (They even turned on a cartoon for our 2 year old)  The Windy City fries were very flavorful and I was surprised how big the large size was! The breakfast burrito was so big we had to bring half of it home!  We got a chicken taco, carne taco, and a pastor taco. They were amazing! And the red sauce on the table gave it that spicy kick I was craving!  The small quesadilla is the perfect size for toddlers and young kids.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, today I walked in for lunch and I was told that I have to wait 45min before I am able to get my order, because the cook was busy with a large placed order and the second cook did not showed up. This is bad for people that only have an hour for lunch, so we had no choice then to leave to go somewhere else. Are you like looking to better accommodate lunch time with a second cook so regular walking customers can enjoy their food?"}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos very good Orchata very good  also. The only problem is the wait they need extra help"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the hidden gems of North Las Vegas. I tried their pastor burrito and windy city cecina fries. They have great salsa to go along with their delicious items. Must try!"}
{"text":"Wow! So very good! Pastor tacos are amazing. The carne asada quesadilla with flour tortilla was the best I've had. They had good prices and nice people."}
{"text":"Just in town this morning for a quick business trip. Found this place on yelp. Reviews were good and the food choices on this side of town were slim pickings. Glad we made the call. Food is excellent! Had the tacos with Asada and Barbacoa. Both amazing. Seriously authentic Mexican food. Not Tex Mex crap. If you want a quality meal at a reasonable price stop by. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Pastor, or seasoned pork, with onion and pineapples is amazing! The staff are super friendly and patient with a newcomer like me."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I went to place that had such great food with amazing service. Everything we had was amazing and the person we ordered from was extremely friendly and helpful with what to order. I got the Windy City fries with half asada and half pastor and it was absolutely killer! My parents got 3 different types of tacos (chicken, asada, and pastor) and they said it was all amazing but their favorite was the pastor with pineapple. Also easily the best horchata I've ever had! Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. Good portions and real reasonable prices . Carnitas and Pastor were good and regular asada tacos too .  My wife , son  y sus novia will go again  I put 4 stars until we repeatedly come back ."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious! Customer service is awesome. Prices are super fair. Honestly have nothing bad to say about this place.  BEST Mexican nachos and steak fries in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was great, fresh, with lots of flavor. Staff was friendly and took the time to explain the menu. Food came out right away and the ambiance was great. Nice to have great Mexican music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Found the taco truck at Findlay North Volkswagen and I got the Asada fries and was amazing and also my man got the $2 Tacos and was just as great!! Would definitely eat again and try more!!"}
{"text":"This isn't our first visit here, so I now am doing the review. Consistently wonderful food & service. Would recommend this great find."}
{"text":"Forget Robertos! Come here! Carne Assad burrito was amazing! Was greeted on the way in and my food was out in 5 minutes. Asada is fresh cooked. Will definitely return here again!"}
{"text":"The cecina tacos were delicious. The steak was so tender and the corn tortillas were wonderful."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Service is fantastic. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for some authentic Mexican that has a bit of a flare. The Windy City fries are out of this world, and the Barbacoa burrito was on point. Great food decent prices. Definitely a gem- of which I will be returning to very soon!"}
{"text":"My daughter loved her chicken quesadilla... but my wife and I have far more discerning tastes for Mexican food since we moved here from San Diego and this place was really bland and boring. Not terrible by any means, but Sin Fronteras has far better flavors at a similar price point.  In the end, I have had better even here with the limited selection in Las Vegas, so I can't imagine I'll ever go back.  It was okay, so don't skip here if it's convenient because it's not horrible, but it's simply not worth a drive if there's another taco shop nearby."}
{"text":"The name says \"Chicago Style\", but I don't really see a difference from traditional. These tacos & nachos are on point!!!! This is def gonna be our family's new taco spot! Friendly service and I loved the 50s station playing on the radio."}
{"text":"Delicious! Don't mind the drive for this place! Had the tacos and they were so good with the red salsa!"}
{"text":"The hell with Robertos, this place and the owner are awesome and the food awesome to! They have my business"}
{"text":"Great family run taco shop. Idk what makes a Chicago style taco shop, but whatever it is tastes good! Good selection of meat and offal to choose from. The flavors are fresh and vibrant. This is a hidden gem, and a nice change from the commercialization of the taco shop."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  Wonderful family service, and man, the food was awesome and cheap! Will be back! !"}
{"text":"I am not sure what Chicago Style means but I like it!!!!  I have only been here twice but I can say I really like what I have had so far.     I went with their suggestion of Windy Style Fries.  You can do small or large and your choice of meat and nacho cheese or Monterey jack and guacamole and sour cream at no additional cost, wow!  I went with the small and it was still huge. The meat I chose was carne asada, and for cheese -Monterey Jack. This was my first asada fries so I can't compare but they were very good and even the small was definitely great for sharing.  I also had to try one of their tacos. Taco Cecina (beef) which is meat that has been salted and dried by means of air, sun or smoke. It was served on a yellow corn tortilla which I am usually not a fan of since they tend to be hard, but this place really changed that for me. it was delicious! The tortilla was smothered with a little bit of refried beans, the nice size piece of steak, cilantro, and onion accompanied by some lime Mmmm!    I got to try my hubby's taco of tripa and chile relleno and they were also delicious!!   A plus is that they also serve breakfast and they have a pretty big and affordable menu. They have so many meat choices and styles so I can't wait to come back and try them all!"}
{"text":"I just love how this place is around the corner from my house!!!!   Their tacos are just soo darn good! Different than a lot of other taco shops. The location is clean, well taken care of and the owners are very friendly.   I highly recommend their fries, their cesina tacos and their barbacoa tacos! Very good food!"}
{"text":"Just moved a few months ago from San Diego. Wanted to find a really good taco shop. This place was awesome. The tacos were delicious and the Windy City fries were so good! All 4 of the salsas where so flavorful and addicting. We will be back on a regular basis! A for sure must try!!"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Out of the three bottles of sauces I chose the red sauce and it was savory and made the tacos even more tasty.   The cleanliness on the establishment was distracting, but nothing that can't be fixed in two hours.  The service was very friendly and spot on and very typical of a Latino place where they will gab with you like family. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"What a gem, place is hard to find yet right in front of your face lol! The lady and I decided to check out a new spot, this fit the bill perfectly. Hot new business, perfect ratings, and close to home. When we arrived it was clean, staff was friendly, and the menu is easy to navigate. Prices are comparable to other similar resrurants. We ordered asada, barbacoa, and pastor tacos along with pastor windy city fries, champorrado, and an horchata. I will say that the meats are outstanding, seasoned very well and cooked perfectly. My favorite was the barbacoa, I usually tend to like the pastor because it has pineapple which adds a tartness and sweetness that I like, but the Barbados was cooked so good that it was the winner for me. We had our tacos with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime and a sampling of their salsas. They have three salsa, an avocado roasted jalapeno it seemed, a fruity fresh tomatillo, and a spicy red pepper salsa. They were all great but I have to admit that the fruity fresh tomatillo was my favorite. The windy city fries was crazy, everything you would expect pastor fries to be and more, pico chopped fine, gauc which had big pieces of avocado in it (yum), and grilled onions! The onions were the kicker and set these apart from everyone else. The champorrado was different and had a banana taste to me, once I tasted it I liked it and liked the fact that it wasn't like everyone else's. The horchata was delicious, smooth, sweet, and had a creamy condense milk taste that was welcomed. All in all I felt like it was a great visit, the owner is humble, makes all of the food from scratch and you can taste the love. It the food continues to stay like this then it will be here for a long time and I'm happy with that as I will be back for more. Of your in the area...or not, take a visit amd try Chicago style tacos. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to most spots in the Vegas area, this is easily now in my top 3!  Had a barbocoa torta, their salsas are great tasting too (hard to find!!! ) . Will try their fries next time."}
{"text":"Friendly husband and wife taqueria team- they emphasize that their tacos are \"Chicago style\" which seems to mean that the yellow corn tortillas are fried. I didn't notice a significant difference in flavor, but the tortillas seemed to hold up better than elsewhere.  There is a good variety of meats and they all seem to be done pretty well: the asada was solid and the barbacoa was a surprise hit. Not only is it difficult to find barbacoa in Vegas, but flavor is hit or miss. Here, they use braised beef cheek for the most flavorful version I've found. I also liked the texture of the lengua.   In addition to tacos, menu has burritos, tortas, plates, and Windy City fries- basically asada fries, with sour cream, pico, guac, and your choice of cheeses. The barbacoa was especially good on this, but I would have preferred a different type of fry than the frozen crinkle-cut variety, which were a bit too thick for my liking. Toppings were super generous though, and even the small size will require you to share with a couple of friends.   Service was friendly but orders came out a bit slowly- keep in mind that this is a two person operation, so be patient. Food is tasty, wish I'd grabbed a torta to take to work the next day. I'm rarely on this side of town, but I'll be suggesting it to others to check out."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations after reading the reviews here. Disappointed. Maybe an off night. Went back 2 more times. Never had that 5 star experience that so many have written about. So I have to give it a solid 3, good neighborhood taqueria, but not worth driving out of the way for."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. You have to try their Nachos and Windy City Fries they are finger lickin good... oh and their Champurrado was perfect for this winter."}
{"text":"Chicago style tacos is a Mexican street style taco , I'm not sure what makes it Chicago style , but these tacos are very tasty. The torllias are yellow corn soft and tasty a step up from most taco shops . The asada carne is moist and fresh ,and best of all it does not have the fatty chewy pieces that slip in most other taco shops.The price is reasonable inexpensive making this a good value for your dinning dollars. This is my second time here and definitely won't be my last. The place is run by the owner , a friendly enthusiastic fellow . There is no language barrier issues as the staff speaks English fluently,  or if you perfer to order in Spanish that is spoken as well. Good food , good service,  the shop it self is not aw inspiring but don't let that fool you this place is good eats."}
{"text":"Never do I write yelp reviews, but when I tell you everyone I go there is something wrong I mean every time. First I asked for rice, never received it, I go back a different day asked for lime, never received it. Last but not least I go in and the lady is rushing me out not even letting me think for what I want. GOOD FOOD but service is literally shit."}
{"text":"The service was amazing.  Really complimentary to my kids.  I was able to try the carne Asada Tacos and barbacoa taco.  Super delicious.  The meat was very flavorful. Even the cops were good and fresh.  Will definitely return again"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite taco shop in Vegas now, the customer service was fantastic, and the food is to die for....the tacos, and WOW the windy city fries  if you haven't what are you waiting for it's AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. The carrots, cabbage and cauliflower in oil and vinegar was the best I have ever had but the place itself wasn't that clean and the bathroom didn't have supplies in it and for that reason (lack of cleanliness) I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"What a gem of a hole in the wall. Definitely would recommend this restaurant. The food taste like it is made with high quality ingredients and the flavors are great. We tried the tortas which are made with a custom bread that is light and toasted perfect. The chicken has a flavor right off the grill. We also tried a taco which was really good. Honestly I am surprised we liked this place as much as we did, but I can hardly wait to come back. As a bonus the place is run by a husband and wife who were super friendly and made us feel very welcome and almost as if we have been friends for years."}
{"text":"Top notch Midwest service in addition to fabulous Chicago style Mexican food. Thoroughly impressed with this place. Just wish it wasn't so far for me. Probably a good thing!"}
{"text":"Meh... I came here with high expectations since the reviews were so high. There was nothing special about it. It was good I guess but definitely nothing to drive all the way out there for again."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in vegas. Great spot to get your fix on mexican food with a variety of meats to choose from.. the combo deals are great because they come with beans and rice or french fries.. the choices of salsas are worth trying and don't forget yo try their fries with a choice of meat, worth every bite... also, the owners and the staff in this taco shop are awesome..."}
{"text":"Visiting from California  and found this little spot. The asada and pastor taco were very good. The menu is very select. Great customer service,  and a clean place.  If you are looking for tacos this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I had just ordered the Asada fries and they taste amazing!!! The presentation looks great. The price for a small size is reasonable but it's good enough for me. I find this way more convenient than other places that serve a lot for 9 bucks. And I can never finish it. But now I have two size choices. Not only that, the taste is amazing! I'm definitely coming back here to try the whole menu! I wish I had gotten the names of the workers there. They were genuinely nice!"}
{"text":"Bomb Tacos!!! I had the Pollo with a side of rice and it was all SO DELICIOUS!!! Will def come back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to eat in our area so I pulled up Yelp. This place was about 8 miles from where we live but the only place within that distance that had an over 4 star rating on Yelp. So we took a shot and headed over. We were a little surprised when we pulled up that it was a smaller place in a strip shopping center but no big deal. First off the food was tremendous (and we eat out about 3-5 times per week). The food blows away even some higher end full service Mexican restaurants that are very expensive. The owner and workers were very helpful and friendly. They offered a sample side of their pork with pineapple and it was out of this world. I'm very picky when it comes to food as I worked in a restaurant for about 20 years. This place was good on every level from the food to customer service. Prices are very affordable/reasonable. Don't hesitate to go here, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good food, I use to be a cook and I seen the senior guy talking shit to the younger guy and it made me laugh and remember when I use to work in a kitchen"}
{"text":"Nothing special. The fries were good, the staff were kind, and the prices were fair. I wasn't impressed with the food. I expected more better from a mom and pop resturaunt."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tacos in town!! Highly addicting and true to authenticity. It is family owned and they have excellent quaility mexican food and service. My kids and I have eaten here a few times and we love everything we have had. I have tried all their tacos and all of them are really good. I love that they have 4 different salsas and all of them pack great flavor. This place is a true gem in North Las Vegas and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some great tacos!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there with a daughter! They were so nice and polite when we ordered. I had the Asada Nachos and they were amazing. The steak was nice and tender! All the ingredients tasted fresh. My husband loved his chicken taco!"}
{"text":"I visited Chicago Style Taco Shop today for the first time, intrigued by it being \"Chicago style\". The food did not disappoint, nor did the service. Joe warmly welcomed my friend and I to the shop and was happy to share information about the different menu items. The flavorful sauces were icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito was delicious! Their loaded fries were awesome. Their $2 quesadilla was not so awesome.  Will definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos and fries and salads. The meat is amazing and the service was fabulous! A must go!"}
{"text":"The service was great... A smile will always go a long way... The tacos were very different from all we've had in vegas for 20+years...because no one here uses yellow tortillas which were amazing! The tripa is really crispy-not chewy like most places here and their salsas were flavorful with plenty of selection- from mild green to habanero  Will most definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT the tacos barbacoa... are sooo... good and they use yellow corn tortillas.. will definitely... return.."}
{"text":"Seeing \"Chicago\" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars.   The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!  I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.   Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.  I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome people id recommend this place to everyone for sure one of the best taco spots in north las vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Just \"Ok\". Nothing really spectacular that would draw me back. Had high expectations based on other reviews. I had the 3 taco combo plate with Barbacoa and Asada tacos."}
{"text":"Great little taco shop. The owners are very friendly and take pride in their restaurant and their food. The portions are great for the price. The thinly sliced seasoned asada was excellent on the tacos and the burrito. The breakfast food looked amazing as well, so we hope to try it out next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Came here because I saw the yelp reviews and was searching for a close by taco shop with good food. You will not be dissapointed. Food was great and it has a small shop feel. Very nice people. This is my new favorite taco shop cant wait to try more food.  Ahora en espanol... Encontre este lugar en yelp y quise probarlo. Me encantaron los tacos. Son estilo tacos de la esquina en mexico jaja de tortilla pequena para explicar mejor. Pero bien deliciosos. Regresare a probar mas cosas. Esta chico el restaurante pero son muy amables los duenos."}
{"text":"Found this place using the yelp app had great reviews and the food is amazing the Windy City fries are so good and the large is huge enough for 2/3 people"}
{"text":"Joe and his staff do an impeccable job. They take great pride in their food, so the taste and quality reflect that.  The Windy City fries are a must have, being an inventive spin on the ever so common carne asada fries.  The Pastor is like nothing I've ever had before. Crispy, buttery, luscious pork morsels grilled and seasoned to perfection. Try it on anything! (Add the pineapple, you won't regret it.)  Whatever you order, be confident you will be taken care of by a local small business with awesome food and great service."}
{"text":"This the by far the best Carne asada fries I've had here in Las Vegas!!! Their staff is very attentive always great customer service. They have freshly made quacamole yummy... I'm getting hungry just talking about it."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for carne asada fries and to me that's a perfect Mexican America comfort food so I always gravitate towards ordering that, and at this small taco shop they happen to have some great carne asada fries(windy city fries) and what I really liked about this place is that I can choose the meat, I got al pastor which is a marinated meat and the large size is a big portion that you can share, I love that it has 2 different cheese on there, melted cheddar cheese and sprinkled mozzarella. My boyfriend got the nachos with carnitas and felt the carnitas where on the dry side but he still thought it was good over all but once he had a bite of my food he was regretting not getting the same thing. This location is really small and kinda hidden, it's more of a to-go place. A con is the menu, when you walk in is on a flat screen tv and it's really small I have bad eye site so I couldn't even see anything on the menu so good thing I looked online before going, and also it was kinda dirty when we came in but the cashier did help clean a table for us so that was nice of her overall I think I would come here again but only when I'm craving those Windy City fries"}
{"text":"Got a nice note from Joe, the owner...had some problem with landlord, but said they should be reopened by Monday, May 30th"}
{"text":"Have not tried their food yet, but just the smell of it .... But what had happened was, I left my debit card after I left, and I did not even realize it.  but they did call me back saying that I left it, so I went back. Literally more than thankful they called !  I just hope they didn't take pics of my card, but I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of taco shops and this shop is by far...top of the list!  Not only are they good, but definitely the best in Vegas!  Don't let the name throw you off...it is authentic as it comes!   And ooooweeee!  Stop in on the weekends for the specialty soups to sooth that hangover!  HAHAHAHA  Food is great, but the friendly smiles and hospitality is even better!  Go and eat at this place!  well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"First time but not our last!! Never knew it was there and authentic,friendly staff..amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries I've ever tried! My favorite spot was back in California but this place beats them for sure. They have great service too. If you come in you have to get the Windy City fries!!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review. Our family decided to dine in on this visit on a Saturday evening. I've been going to Chicago tacos for a while now and we pick up food pretty often. I ordered my usual tacos pastor without onions. Plate came out and the meat is completely different than what they've had EVERY single time I've been there and there's tons of onions and no pineapple (this came automatically with pastor). Lady taking the order doesn't speak good English so she asked a younger guy to help translate. I explained politely that I ordered no onions and he said the mixture already has onions   ?? I asked him if they have a new mixture now for pastor because it never had onions and came with pineapple. he said no it's been the same. Seems odd because the meat was large strips compared to a chopped style meat before. None the less I take the plate and decide to pick out the onions but I couldn't even eat the tacos because it was very spicy !!! Again I bring my plate up and speak to the younger guy and see if they could possibly make a different meat because it's very spicy.  The young guy storms off and pushes the work cart out of frustration.. very very uncalled for as I was polite to him and the other workers.  I then have to wait about 15/20 min as he purposely takes his time to remake my plate .. great food but this very uncalled for , not sure if I'll be back    Great tacos !!!!! Nachos are soooo good , loaded with a ton of meat. Also ordered the 3 tacos. Pastor, carne asada & chicken. Great prices !!!"}
{"text":"Never had Chicago style taco's and oh my they are bomb!! I drive by this place every day and it's made the list my new favorite taco shop on this side of town!! The staff is very friendly so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better tortas I've had around. However the beans had no flavor, it was just mush, which was very off putting. I would probably get another torta from here, but my husband was so disappointed by the beans in his burrito and on the carne asada fries, that he doesn't want to go again. So unfortunately we probably won't with so many other Mexican food places by that sever similar items."}
{"text":"I didn't understand what \"Chicago\" style tacos meant. I'm from LA so I guess I assumed people in Chicago don't eat tacos! J/k.  I didn't eat much, so I can't comment on the beans and rice. I had a Carne Asada taco. The tortillas were very soft, the meat was well seasoned,and the salsa was the best! Too bad no chips to dip....but it is a small taco shop. I will have to go back to try the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I must say this Hole-in-the-wall eatery was a great surprise :D  My bf and I just popped in because of the reviews and the star ratings; ratings didn't lie on how good this place is. Although It is located inside a gas station, do not be dismayed by it's location or you'll pass by some well prepared tacos and tortas  Tacos weren't small at all  Horchata was delicious and my bf's torta was bomb af  From my thorough observations they do a good job in keeping up with their health code regulations (trust me, even the best places don't)  Might be a family ran business because it did seem like a father and daughter were providing my service. The cook came out to double check if everything came out good and IT MOST DEFINITELY DID"}
{"text":"After seeing the raving reviews on here, I knew we had to try this place.   We were not disappointed!!  The food here is so fresh and so good!   The staff was so friendly too!    We ordered 8 tacos (I love that lettuce and tomato is an option vs onion and cilantro!), a small order of the Windy City Fries and a quesadilla. It was under thirty bucks with tip. Where can you buy dinner for three for that price?!    We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"while looking on yelp for a new place to eat, my two friends & i luckily came upon this family owned/run taco shop. they have great prices for a large quantity of food. i got the chicken nachos (about $8), my friend got the carne asada nachos (about $8), and my other friend got two vegetarian tacos with a side of french fries (not sure of the price). although it took a while (10/15 minutes) for us to get our food, it was well worth the wait. the food not only looked, but also tasted amazing. i enjoyed eating here much more than any other taco shop in the valley. i'll definitely be becoming a regular customer."}
{"text":"Friendly, quality food, and a quiet sit down spot to eat. First time going , definitely going back (:"}
{"text":"We come here about once a week and they never fail! I love their consistency!! We have the exact same order everytime ! Al pastor burrito & Al pastor windy city fries! Best ive ever had and way better than tacos el Gordo i love the flavors and their salsa is out of this world!!! Ive also tried their tortas and breakfast burritos and they were delicious!!! There al pastor includes deliciously grilled onions and we always ask for piña(pineapple)!!Weve been coming here since they first opened and there was no decor or nice seating, theyve put lot of effort and I love the improvements they have made theyre a family owned company with a hard work ethic and delicious recipes!! The owner and the staff are always so nice to us ! We love this place and will continue to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Hard day at work?...stressed?...having just a sucky day? Then come here and I promise the guys at Chicago Style Taco shop will turn your frown upside down. You seriously can not eat this food without immediately feeling an overwhelming sense of joy. Their tacos are the freshest around with a wide selection of meats topped with diced onions and cilantro. My favorite are the pastor (pork) and the asada (steak). Top these babies with one of their three house made sauces and you will be smiling in no time. Their windy city fries are a must try when you come here. They are fries topped with your choice of meat, cheese, guac,  sour cream,pico, and salsa. You have the choice of small ($6) or large portion($12). This place truly gives you a great value for the quality of food that they make."}
{"text":"Looks like a small little shop. But don't let the size fool you! The food was by far the best tasting Mexican food in Vegas. Everything we tried had so much flavor! The service was great and the prices were good. It was worth the 45 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass Chicago style fries. Fire tacos. Love my fam from chitown   Been here several times and the customer service is great"}
{"text":"My First time and will not be my last, great food, great people that work there. Nice, friendly and welcoming, looking forward to my next time. The food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Found this little place on Yelp and after seeing they had five stars, I knew I had to try it. The name is a little deceiving because who thinks Chicago style tacos would be good tacos lol I'm from LA, I know good tacos. Worst part of the experience was not personally ordering enough tacos!! They were so good!! I could have had a dozen to myself and can't wait to go back and get more! I'm mad I live so far cause this place would be a daily stop for me! The tacos were bomb, the asada fries were damn good and you can't beat the prices. I'm so tired of being charged thru the roof for tacos that suck. Here you get great tasting food for cheap! I'll definitely be coming back when ever I'm on that side of town! Worth the trip! Give them a shot!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch based on reviews while in town on a business trip. They did not disappoint! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went late at night and the owner was there. He was so nice and the food was delicious!!!! Def going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos  Very friendly  Never had a problem  The workers are amazing. Better than most taco shops i been to"}
{"text":"Their are other Mexican food places in North Town, but NONE of them are like this place. Fantastic Tasting food with excellent plate appeal. The service is top notch and it IS worth the drive. I have meet the owner and he is truly professional. His main goal is to see that his customers are satisfied and happy!  It worked :) !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Stopped in by accident while waiting for a haircut at Style 5 next door (which is also amazing).so glad we did!  The chicken tacos are so yummy!  But also the FRIES!  The nacho fries are so good!  You gotta try this place! The people who work there are so incredibly nice. I was so impressed all around."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was extremely satisfied! The place was clean and the staff was awesome and friendly! Lenny took care of me with those killer Chicago style carne asada fries!! Thanks Lenny! Defiantly a must try!"}
{"text":"Second visit here to pick up office lunch. We love everything we've tried so far. Windy City Fries (Carne Asada), Carnitas, El Pastor, Chile Relleno.. The sauces, the burritos, the people... Hard to find fault. Just plain good food at prices that will allow us to make this a go-to lunch stop! Next up will be a breakfast run!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos!great sauces!  Windy fries are a must try !  Quiet place very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Definitely nothing to bring me back for more. The health inspector rating of a C was not a plus either. Would take Robertos over this any day of the week."}
{"text":"The Chicago style fries are so good the yellow corn tortillas for the tacos are good for something different the carne asada burrito will surprise you with the girth all the salsas are super yummy and make the food just pop"}
{"text":"Been here 5 years now. Still the best tacos in Vegas!!!  My favorite are the cecina tacos! But everything else I've tried was delicious too!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Door Dash.  Had 4 tacos: Al pastor, lengua, chorizo, and barbacoa. All on double yellow corn tortillas  cooked nicely. The pastor was very nice and served w/ pineapple. Lengua moist and flavorful. Chorizo chunky and spicier than most other places. I didn't care for taste of the barbacoa. It was just off putting to me. Also ordered rice and bean sides, but didn't care for the texture of beans.  I'll get tacos again and try other meats. Would also try other products"}
{"text":"3 Combo platter with pollo, pastor, and Barbao.   Veggie Burrito - with beans, rice, lettuce, avocado, and sour cream.    Quesadilla -melted jack cheese sandwiched between two flour tortillas   Fries-pappa fritas were thick cut crinkle cuts and tasted good.   Tacos were good. Corn tortillas were fried perfect. The 3 sauces they deliver to the table were tasty and varied in spice level. I suggest labeling or at least explaining what to expect from each sauce.   Tables were kind of grime. The staff was friendly but not outgoing. I had unfortunately had an experience no one should have that really makes me 2nd guess about even thinking to come back. All I gotta say is lock the restroom door when deuce in it up jeffe."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their tacos  and for the price it is so worth it ! Going to try their Windy City fries nest time I visit!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great atmosphere. Place is... Well, great! I'm vegetarian and that's never been an issue. The staff always offers to make any dish vegetarian for me which is awesome. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So so so so amazing.  5 stars is setting it low.  I ordered the Windy City Fries with barbacoa meat.  Both cheeses-mozzarella and cheddar.   The fries were crispy after the meat and cheese were drizzled on top with pico de gallo and guacamole on the side.   The manager/owner gave us FREE TACOS  to try with their pickled vegetables.  My friend and I ordered Al Pastor tacos.  So so good.   Everything was five stars.  Genuine service  Amazing food  Incredible sauces   I wish I could give 11 stars.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"One word. DELICIOUS. I tried a little bit of everything and it is soooo good. I especially loved the Wendy City Fries, and the horchata. Yum. The place is clean and the staff/owners are so sweet, so lovely. I'll be making it a tradition to come here wherever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm in search of the very best taco. Food was average in my opinion. I had a 3 street tacos carnitas, pollo, and carne asada with rice. Carnitas was the most flavorful, rice was not something that was needed since it lacked texture and flavor. I always look to see if there is something worth coming back for, something I've not tasted before and have to eat again, sorry to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was un real, the best taco from them is the taco with a hint of pineapple. Between the cilantro and the pineapple I was amazed at the combination  The restaurant is very clean and the owner waits on you personally great food and service folks I am going again"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and I will definitely be back. Everything was 5!! The food, and service was on point. They serving sizes where big and filling. An it's cheap, this is now my new go to spot."}
{"text":"This is my go to taco shop! Wife hates when I go here because I always order too much but its Oh so good. Beats chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Windy city fries are bomb and the tacos.  Awesome family owned place. They just opened another location on lake Mead as well.  Worth a try.  The salsa options are good."}
{"text":"Since I've never heard of Mexican food that would meet my California standards in Chicago, I was trusting the Yelp reviews when I tried Chicago Style Taco. I loved my chicken torta... It was well balanced with shredded chicken, avocado, beans, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and tomato in an excellent soft bun. I asked the woman who served us why Chicago was in the name and she said it was because all the ingredients were fresh. Works for me. My sister wasn't as thrilled with her tacos as I was with my torta, but they were decent. Thank you for the good lunch!"}
{"text":"Was very good. The fries were amazing and the pastor was super tender.  The service took a little while but that is because it is freshly made. The tortillas had a great flavor and the salsas were awesome!"}
{"text":"Great little joint. BBQ beef was the best.  There fries are out of this world.  Staff was friendly and everything made fresh.  Owner showed up and was great."}
{"text":"Really great service and food! Ordered the nachos with Asada and it was big enough for two ! Tacos were tasty and authentic too! Will be back for more again."}
{"text":"This was very unexpected. It's really far from the strip. But worth the drive. Upon entering it wasn't too crowded. A simple menu of tacos burritos nachos. I ordered three tacos. The Asada, cecina, and al pastor. The tacos were very big. What I noticed were the corn tortillas were lightly crispy which added to the texture of the tacos. The tacos were topped with cilantro and onionsThe meats were chunky in a good way. They had 3 different spicy sauces.I enjoyed all the tacos. Really really good!   Recommendation: al pastor taco , Asada tacos , cecina tacos"}
{"text":"Wow the service in this place is unreal! The tacos are even more unreal! I've never seen this kind of service in Las Vegas and you won't be disappointed after trying their tacos either. Give this place a chance I did and I didn't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food. Great customer service. Great prices. What more can you ask for? Nada. Mom and Pop type of shop. Very welcoming. We ordered asada nachos, tacos and burrito (picture posted). It was delicious, authentic and HUGE! Their salsa/hot sauces were amazing! Try all 3. Spicy but it's worth the sweat! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Home style version of taco y taco. I loved it. Food was great, salsa was great and the family who owns and operates it was very very friendly. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The trip as were on point and delicious! The torta was excellent and the owners were very friendly!"}
{"text":"This taco shop does it right. Food was outstanding and staff was very courteous. This was my first visit but certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"Loved it- our group tried the Chicago style nachos, burrito and tacos. We were greeted at the register with excellent advice for what to order. We weren't too adventurous- had steak, pork and chicken. The chicken was a tiny bit dry but remedied easily by the yummy green salsa. The fantastic guacamole is a must have!"}
{"text":"The asada tacos were so fresh, I had to let them cool off before I could eat them. Yummy! Asada fries were delicious, will definitely order them again. My favorite was the Jamaica drink, it tastes just like the one my mom makes. We will be coming back to our new favorite taco place :)"}
{"text":"Great service! I got just what I wanted! I asked for the meat to be well done on my windy city fries and it was! The fries were crispy not soggy like robertos.  was goodaround really good! Will stop by again!"}
{"text":"I saw a photo from this place on YelpLV on Instagram and I had to go for lunch. I was also intrigued by the name... I wanted to know what Chicago tacos were all about! It was kind of hard to find because they have yet to place an updated sign up. The place looks like your typical hole in the wall, very clean though. They have a large menu with a ton of options but it is not at all overwhelming. I was greeted by two friendly faces who explained the story behind the name and that they've been open for only two months. The man behind the grill seemed super confident saying they're style is totally different from any other taco spot out here.. Bring it buddy! I ordered the small chicken and barbacoa Windy City fries for $5.99 a piece which were more than enough for a single person each. I got really excited  when I saw him scooping Guac out of a small bowl like he made it just for my dishes.  I took it home with some sauces and everything was so amazingly fresh.. The fries stayed crispy, everything was full of flavor. They really focus on every detail that goes into their dishes. The sauces are extremely potent, which is great because I like it hot! I got full before I could finish my fries. I feel like I got more than enough bang for my buck. And I can definitely see myself craving more trips to Chicago Style Taco Shop in the near future!"}
{"text":"La comida estaba buenísimo me quedo lleno y con ganas de comer más me e canta le música y la gente."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious, but the customer service is amazing too. Joe, the owner, personally let us try all of the meats and salsas before we decided what we wanted to order. I ended up with the carnitas, and my husband got pastor, lengua, and chicken, and it was all amazing. If you love tacos, you will love this place. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great authentic street tacos with a twist!  The salsa is actually hot and spicy  which we like and the service is good from this family owned business."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, I come in time and time again and I'm never disappointed. Anything and I mean ANYTHING you order on this menu will not disappoint...... amazing customer service,flavors out of this world, The owner is a really nice guy.. and you can tell he wants to keep his customers happy!!!!if you're anywhere on Craig and in need of some amazing food, make sure you stop by Chicago Style  shop!!!! You definitely won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to CSTS for a Taco Tuesday celebration with some fellow Yelpers and my belly liked with it tasted. I have since been at least 10 times. Service and food quality is consistent, but the prep/wait time for your order can vary drastically. I always order the 3 veggie taco combo which comes with a side of rice, beans, and a drink. This plate fills me up for sure. The sauces they offer and great- and can knock your socks off so be careful which one you choose.  As far as cleanliness- I would give it 2 1/2 stars. Not sure how long the taco shop has been there, but it could use some more modern touches and a good scrub down. I have seen few cockroaches (dead) down the hallway towards the bathroom. And during one stop- I saw what appeared to be either a friend or family member of the owner take his lady friend into the storage room next to the soda machine and they laid down together on a bed with the door open in plain view of the customers..  Anyway-- I still will go to eat here, but usually get everything to go."}
{"text":"Windy City fries were good, Al pastor was good, Chicken Quesadilla was fire. Salsas had flavor as well."}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this little gem of a taco shop. Fresh food, quick service, friendly staff, and great prices! What else can you ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"This spot is really good. And isn't greedy with food. I had the wind city asada fries, al pastor tacos. Really good!! Will definitely come back soon to try something something different."}
{"text":"We visited this new place for us. We are always willing to try new food. We wanted something not too heavy for our late lunch/early dinner date...we decided on tacos.. he got the taco combo plate which came with rice and beans his choice of tacos were chicken, al pastor, and carnitas. I ordered just the tacos and got al pastor, carnitas, barbacoa. All flavors were super delicious!!! My personal favorite is barbacoa!! We just found this spot and will definitely be going back!!! The very nice lady and young man were so very nice and accommodating!!! Chicago Style Taco shop will be your favorite taco spot too!!! This little hole in the wall has very BIG flavors!!! Try it!! You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We were anticipating and was looking forward the whole day in trying out this place for the first time on Cinco de Mayo. When we finally had the chance that night to eat dinner there, it was already closed after 8pm (place closes at 1000pm)! We were upset because we was so looking forward in trying out this place for the first time due to the wonderful reviews and was wondering why they were closed. Leo, stepped out of the restaurant and informed us that they ran out of Tortillas. We were quite bummed out. I informed Leo that it would of been the first time for us to try out this place. He looked at us and invited us to come in and was going to muster us a meal. We were grateful, but declined after he insisted to accommodate us. We told him that we will just return tomorrow, which we did to give this place a chance. We returned the following day and this place didn't disappoint! Everything we ordered was delicious, full flavored and the salsa options were awesome! Leo noted we returned and apologize again for the inconvenience the night before. He hooked us up and the rest of the staff were welcoming and wonderful! We surely be returning regularly again!"}
{"text":"Chicago style taco shop is a small strip mall taco joint. They have tables inside, a bathroom, and a soda fountain - everything you need to get down with some strip mall tacos! The food was surprisingly good. I had a burrito and asked them to mod it up to include lettuce and omit the beans and they pulled it off like it was a menu standard. The chicken was moist and delicious, and the veggies and tortilla were fresh. Guys working there were friendly, and parking is easy given the location. If you need a cheap taco fix in the area this is the #1 go to spot!"}
{"text":"The Windy City Asada Fries newest obession...and this is the SMALL?!?! YES will most definitely be coming back for their amazing food AND prices. #cheatmeals #notsorry"}
{"text":"Tried this place last week food was good a little better than a Robertos what set them apart for me was their homemade salsas omg the were delicious! I used their \"non spicy\" green sauce. The cashier brought the salsas to our table & Staff was nice.   The only thing I did not like was when we went in i guess their AC Unit was out so they were using a huge swamp cooler it made my experience humid/hot & uncomfortable. I hope they get their AC fixed soon! Other than that problem I would return."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Loved the Windy City fries. Went with the pork which has a bit of pineapple. Who knew how delicious it would be. Friendly and quick service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not worth it... whole family got nachos.. i had the carnitas nachos.. none of us were really impressed.. they were pretty bland :/ .. maybe i shouldve tried their tacos? Stars for fast service,  i orderd pick up and they had me in and out in no time"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty small. I went on a Sunday around 12:30 and the place was packed. It took a little bit of time for them to take our order. The restaurant was pretty hot as well. We ordered the chicken nachos and 6 tacos (2 chicken, 2 asada & 2  barbacoa). We had to wait a long time to get the food as well because of the lunch rush but everything was DELICIOUS! It was way too much food for two people. The chicken nachos are huge and can probably be a meal for two on their own! The tacos were awesome. All the meat seasoning was really good and the salsas were great. All the workers were really nice. We asked for a to-go box for the nachos and the lady working there added some more sauce to the nachos before we left. I really enjoyed this place. Only thing stopping it from being 5 stars is the wait for food and their air conditioning."}
{"text":"Once again, thank you Yelp!  I was in NLV and hungry, so I turned to Yelp for some guidance on something tasty and cheap.  Chicago Style Tacos pops up and it's only .3 miles away.  I head over to a little plaza and initially can't find it.  I see a Carnitas Tacos, but no Chicago Style.  I circle the plaza and see a Chicago Style banner hanging in the Carnitas Tacos window. It's held up by some duct tape.  Uh oh...do I dare go in?  Am I going to regret this?  I'm starving so I enter.    It's pre-lunch so I'm the only one in there.  I ask the guy what the difference is between Chicago style tacos and others.  After all, I'm from LA and have had some of the best taquerias in the world in my backyard.   He says they use yellow corn tortillas instead of white.  And they make everything fresh to order.  Umm...okay.    Now my initial concerns from the exterior aren't alleviated when I walk in.  They don't have cash in the drawer so it's cash only at the moment.  Their fountain soda machine isn't working.  Ugh.  Anyways, I'm hungry so I order three tacos: asada, pastor, and pollo. Plus an old school glass bottle of Coke for $1.  Food comes out and it looks great.  They have three sauces:  Spicy Red, Spicy Creamy Green, Mild Green.  I take turns between the two spicy ones and both are delicious!!  All three tacos were delicious too.  Next time around, I would have a hard time ordering just one of the meats. They're all equally tasty.    Yea, the place is a dive.  But service was good, prices were right ($2 each taco), and the food was fresh and delicious.   I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the windy city fries and steak tacos.  It is plenty of food thats for sure but the food was not seasoned and that was a huge issue for me.....you will be surprised with how far just a little salt and pepper will take a dish..... Im pretty sure I will not revisit this place when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was great. The owner actually works here so the service is great and they are nice. I am not eating meat anymore but this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've gotten take-away from CST several times, and I can say that they have the best nachos in Las Vegas. Note that I'm from the Midwest, and this is similar to what nachos are like there. I've had better tortas and quesadillas elsewhere, but theirs are decent. This is my new favorite taco shop in town."}
{"text":"Please order the Al Pastor Quesadilla with the pineapple. It was sooo gooooood...."}
{"text":"Went in to see if it lived up to its ratings and it did!  Was a bit difficult finding it because their sign isn't up but its under the Taco shop sign if youre struggling to find it. The service was really friendly and welcoming! Got to talk to the owner of the store, he was really nice and friendly.   The food lived up to the reviews, got the small Windy City Fries, wanted to try the Pastor but they ran out so tried the Chorizo but was still satisfied. Half way of eating it i already got full, and not really pricey so thats a thumbs up. Tried their Spanish rice and pickled Jalapenos, would say its better than a others. Would definitely recommend it to my friends! Good food. Good service. Good people."}
{"text":"These people like they work hard and food looks great. They are playing suavamente and doing there damn best to serve all the customers they have waiting. Haven't had the food yet but just based on atmosphere and hard work I see them putting in I will be back."}
{"text":"Great prices and huge portions. I ordered a small size of windy city fries with asada and a pair of tacos. This came out to under $11 and ended up being more than enough food for one. The meats were cooked on order, fresh and tasted great. Same goes for the produce topped on the food and they were very fair with their avocado distribution. The best part may have been the fries. Crinkle cut and fried to a nice crisp golden brown perfection. Chicago Style Taco Shop is worth checking out."}
{"text":"MAN!!!! What can I say. Their food is so freaking delicious it's unreal. It's really hard to find good Mexican Food in Las Vegas. Coming from San Diego  and L.A. I was spoiled. I moved to Las Vegas and everyone was recommending Roberto's Taco Shop.. Sorry but if you think Roberto's is tasty...well...we have very different taste buds.   On another note I was saddened to see that the last time I came by someone had smashed the glass on their door... This is an honest small business trying to make a living. Replacing a glass door is not cheap.   We will be back soon, I've got a craving again!"}
{"text":"The small carne asada fries is huge.  Good flavor on the al pastor.  The chorizo was dried out.   The cashier was moody."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem by accident and so glad we did, I understand why it's so highly rated on Yelp, Facebook, and Google. Friendly staff who make you feel welcome and go out of their way to ensure a good experience. Food is phenomenal. We had a burrito with rice and beans meal and the 3 taco meal -pork and chicken. Good size portions, delicious authentic food, good price and great staff. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service,simple food with definitely delicious flavors.  Joe is a cool cat man stands by his product, as do I!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for a taco and much better than Tacos el Gordo.  Salsas were very good and the habanero one brings a little kick!  Service was efficient and friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Recently moved into this area and I was really hungry one day. I open up Yelp and see what's nearby. Boom! A taco shop with a near perfect score and literally, walking distance from me! I couldn't say no to that. I started making my way to Chicago Style Tacos and I couldn't really see it. I don't think it had a sign at the moment but either way I found it. I get in there and I am greeted and I let the cashier know it's my first time there and she starts giving me great suggestions. I ended up getting the Windy City fries with al pastor and asada meat and it was AMAZING. I was hooked. I've gone to this place a couple more times and I don't think I am ever going to get tired of it. I love how close it is to me. I am so glad I came upon this spot. Great customer service and great food."}
{"text":"The nachos are OUTSTANDING! The beans are tasty, and the shredded chicken is juicy & delicious. My wife loved the tripas. And the people there are fantastic. The helped mind my food allergy (no pork, no beef) by offering vegan options. They don't use pork/lard in their refried beans or tortillas. So good."}
{"text":"You'll find some of the better tacos in town at this small, hole-in-a-wall shop in the northwest owned by a husband and wife team. At $2 per taco, they're a bargain. Each of these street-style tacos come with tortillas doubled-up, with your choice of protein, and onions and cilantro. Of the five I tried I really liked the thin, salted cecina, the tender beef cheek barbacoa, and the well seasoned al pastor."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to order some lunch to-go. There was a nice lady who greeted me as I walked inside. She gave me plenty of time to look over the menu and decide what I wanted to order. I have to say I was a little nervous at first because it looked like the inside good use a deep cleaning all over, but after seeing all the buzz on yelp I decided to give it a try...... Then seeing what Loren F. mentioned about the cleanliness in her review after I had eaten there kind of made me think about not going back even if I did like some of my food because I noticed some of the same cleanliness issues.   Tacos Combo ($8.50) - 3 tacos, rice and beans with cheese are in this combo. You can choose from different meats it doesn't all have to be the same kind of taco, so I went with 3 different tacos. The carnitas, chicken and pastor were all tasty meats. I actually ended up just eating the filling with a fork and it tasted good. I wasn't sure what \"Chicago Style\" tacos were, but according to Stefany V.'s review it apparently means that they serve yellow corn tortillas that are fried. I personally found them to taste hard and stale which is why I ate the inside salad style with a fork. I also didn't get the tomato slices they put on the tacos when chopped tomatoes just make more sense. The rice had great flavor while the beans had crunchy bits, yuck. Lots of hit and miss here.   Windy City Fries ($5.99 for small size) - The fries come topped with your choice of meat and pico, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. I asked for no meat and extra beans instead and they made it that way with no problem. The problem I ended up having was the beans had crunchy bits just like the beans with my taco combo, no bueno. The fries actually held everything up well and didn't get soggy which is a plus and the pico and guac were pretty good, but those crunchy beans ruined it."}
{"text":"Our office went here for the first time for lunch and the steak biritto was horrible and the FF were stone cold. Never again!"}
{"text":"Steak nachos - steak was tough. I did'nt care for them because of that. My take out nachos - I ate only some, took the meat off of them, threw away the remainder. Gave the meat to my dogs. They enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Good grub over here, when you are there you gotta have the \"Windy City\" fries those joints are the business !!....ohhhhh yea try out the different styles of hot sauces & salsas too muy fuego !!"}
{"text":"Excellent price and quality. Full size Chicago style fries could easily feed a family of 4. Usually not a fan of Fortas, but this place changed my mind."}
{"text":"Was craving tacos and wanted a cheap taco Tuesday deal that didn't involve Del taco and nothing against Del taco but I was feeling something a bit more authentic & ended up at Chicago Style... it wasn't bad. Once I realized where it was I said to myself wow I've driven past this place many times and didn't know it was there.. it's located in a small business complex but if you blink you'll drive right by it. Anyway the tacos were delicious my only thing I can say that I wasn't thrilled with is that they don't use crunchy shells they make them with corn tortillas... held up well as u ate them but I just like that crunch so I had two beef tacos and my boyfriend had two beef and one chicken but later on ran out to the store for a bag of potato chips because they are small but good value.... I could've even ate another one but I didn't want to be greedy  Tuesday special is between $1.50-2.50 it's a pretty good value I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is 3rd time here! I highly recommend this place for Mexican food!! You won't leave disappointed. Everything is made right away!"}
{"text":"We finally made it back there and I must say amazing. The food was full of flavor and eveything was prepared in a timely manner. The staff are so wonderful and friendly. It's a grrat family run business and I would highly recommend it to anyone. We definitely will be back especially because it's so close to our home. Stop on in and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Had some time before an appointment and stopped in as they had 5 * rating. The restaurant itself isn't anything special. Greeted by friendly husband wife duo. Ordered Carne  burrito with beans and rice to be safe. Immediately could tell ingredients were fresh.  Meat was tasty. Juicy. Owner states he trims and cooks all meats in house. 3 types of salsa are available. All are flavorful, fresh and made in house. Owner gave me a free barbacoa taco. Wonderful flavor. I'm a big guy and couldn't eat it all Try em if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Will be returning. They have menu items I've never seen before that I will be trying like:cecina or picadillo  tacos/burritos."}
{"text":"always on point delicious food. only bad thing is their AC doesn't work. small price to pay for great food."}
{"text":"The last time a Mexican restaurant with a 5 star average disappointed me, it was the highly overrated Mariscos Playa Escondida(1 star for me)...Reluctant to fall for the same trap again, we drove up to the front of the shop one day...and backed out, opting to go somewhere else. Fast foward a couple of weeks later, Wifey comes back raving about their Cecina(Thin Salted Steak) Tacos stopping by after work one evening, and if she says it's good, IT'S GOOD! The 5 stars do not lie! This is a definite diamond in the rough in all of Vegas' taquerias. SHAME ON ME for diving away the first time!  Locally owned, family run, and clean little taqueria with just a few tables and chairs, the service here is great as well. Don't know what really differentiates Chicago style from say, Cali style, but all I know is that they serve some damn good tacos! They have some of the widest variety of options I've seen-  Asada(Grilled Steak) Cecina(Thin Salted Steak) Picadillo(Ground Beef) Barbacoa (Braised Beef Cheeks) Carnitas(Shredded Pork) Al Pastor(Marinated Pork) Chorizo(Spicy Pork Sausage) Pescado(Fish) Chile Relleno(Pasilla Chili with Cheese) Pollo(Chicken) Lengua(Beef Tongue) Tripas(Beef Intestines/Chitterlings)  Aside from Tacos, They also offer Tortas, Burritos, Combination Plates, Nachos, Loaded Fries with your choice of meat and even Beakfast items. I decided to go with a Cecina, Chile Relleno, and Tripas Taco. Yellow corn tortillas are used here, and they oil them up just right, so you don't feel like you're eating a piece of cardboard. Tacos are topped with cilantro and onions with some lime on the side, and while they do not have a salsa/condiment bar, they do have three different salsas in squeeze bottles and escabeche veggies(Carrots and chiles in vinegar) I enjoyed all my tacos that I got that I had to get two more Tripas tacos...If you're a fan of Tripas like I am, request them \"Bien Doradito\" if you like 'em a little more crispier! Bonus also for having agua frescas made from scratch!  Looking forward to returning to try other menu items. If you're ever on this side of town and craving some tasty comida Mexicana, check this place out!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  5"}
{"text":"The windy city fries are fucken bomb I'm not sorry about my langiage that how amazing they are and burrito is fat didnt try it yet tho"}
{"text":"Had the chorizo tacos, they were awesome! I recommend you give this spot a try. The service was quick and food was prepared fast."}
{"text":"Good food, but for the customer service, price, and fairly long wait time, I'm not too big of a fan. When I came as a first time customer at 9 pm on a Friday night, I was with my sister and we were not greeted or looked at for the first four minutes as we stood in front of the register.   When we finally were, an older lady with thick eyeliner did not speak English well and took our order of fish tacos and windy city fries which cost $18 and took nearly half an hour to get to us. Actually, it was made in 25 minutes but the old lady was in the back hanging out and didn't wrap our stuff until five minutes had passed, at which point the nicer guy who speaks English told her to get to it, so she did.   The Windy City fries were good, but if she's working the front I'd not bother ordering from her."}
{"text":"Great Food. Everything made fresh. I had a taco combo and my daughter had some Windy City fries. Friendly staff. Will come back often."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We had the food catered for our reception and all of our guests loved the tacos  and the Windy City fries were delicious! We will definitely return to this taco heaven! And on top of that the service was great! Thank you Joe!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm from Cali and this is my favorite Mexican spot in LV, great customer service and amazing food. Me and my gf will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My siblings and I looked this place up on Yelp before coming in and with 4 1/2 stars we were excited to come in and order . When we got there were very surprised at the lack of professionalism and order in the establishment . First, The area where you order was crammed and it was hard to maneuver to order and the worker even took our order from our side of the counter . We placed our order and as we Waited VERY patiently (you have to have patience here) it took AT LEAST 30 minutes just to get our tacos and all of our food came separately within a 30-45 min time span . As we began to eat we noticed the meat was SEVERELY under seasoned , we had to add salt to everything and the salsa had no kick at all or flavor . The idea of the salsa was so much better than the taste . And to wash it down we had a soda from the soda machine that was nearly out of syrup and it was obvious . Our view was a dirty kitchen and the two workers speaking very loudly  about how long everyone's order was going to take IN FRONT of the customers . There was so much wrong with this place I think 4 1/2 stars was VERY excessive but , different strokes for different folks .... You've been warned"}
{"text":"Wow! What a pleasant surprise! First off, if you aren't looking for this gem, you'd pass right by. The staff is incredibly welcoming and it's definitely a family environment. We ordered a carne asada burrito and the Chicago fries. The carne asada was also fresh and so tender/ juicy and the burrito was grilled to perfection. The Chicago fries had fresh fries that were cooked to order. I'm just blown away by how amazing and fresh their food is. Please stop by, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is deff quality the taste is amazing with every bite and presentation makes you hungrier then when you walked in the doors like if the yelp reviews and pictures didn't already want to make you come. I got Nachos with alpastor that has a taste that resonates in your mouth even after your done eating. I recommend this to anyone that loves tacos!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time back and we'll definitely keep coming back. Believe it or not it's hard to find GOOD Mexican/taco places. I think our search is over. The employees are super friendly (always a plus) I got the 3 taco combo and my boyfriend got the Windy City fries and they were very tasty he ordered a small and it was definitely more than enough. try them out!"}
{"text":"Yep. Fivers. This lil hole in the wall will fill a big hole in your belly while not disappointing on price, portion and, most importantly, flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Great food & great service every time we go in.  The employees are always so friendly.  The windy city fries are my favorite and they are generous with the portions.  It's also a bonus to me to support a small family owned business."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The best tacos I've had since San Diego. The fries I'm addicted to them. Totally exceeded my expectations and the people were so nice!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good! The customer service is great. They're always very friendly. I always place my order in and they always have it ready for me just in time. I always get nachos here (by far the best). Their seasoning is always on point. They also have affordable prices."}
{"text":"Really good Taco Shop. Seems like they're new so they're grtting the hang of it. If you're looking for a good place to grab a bit to eat for lunch or a good torta this place is it. I had the barbacoa torta and it was great. Also, got thier Carne Asada fries (small) and the portions were generous. Workers are friendly and at tentative! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I did the yelp thing and look for a new place to try. I found this place, the food looked amazing. It said it opened in 5 minutes (10am) so drove over and got there around 10:05.  I had to send a few  texts to someone so I ended getting to the door at around 10:08. The door was locked but I could see people inside(who glanced at me and  didn't even acknowledge me). I looked at the door and yeah it said 10am. So confused I walked back to my car and as soon as I got in a lady came up to the door.. turned on the \"open\" sign and then unlocked the door and walked away. Still not acknowledging me. I said well I'm definitely it going in there now and drove off. Those people hate their job so why would I trust them with making me food. If I went back in they may have spit in it. Seemed like that type of place based on my first experience of it. I don't recommend it at all. I worked in a hotel/casino and service is our first priority.  I can't stand when people can't even be descent with you when your giving them money"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service, and reasonable prices. Definitely a nice change of pace from our \"chain\" taco joints."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I found this spot through yelp and saw the reviews was 4  stars and I wanted to see. I was impressed by the food. I would definitely come back to get Windy City Fries. I love their food now."}
{"text":"The best tacos!! The tortillas are delcious! Great staff and atmosphere....i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here since it first opened and it was great then, but man it's even better now! Meat tastes great, guacamole is amazing, tortilla chips fresh. We were debating on going to Cabo in fiesta and I don't think we'll ever have that debate again. This place wins. Very happy to see that they look like they're doing good business too."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Very authentic and delicious. They are always friendly and I always get my food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this beautiful gem here in North Las Vegas.  The VIBE is great, the staff is super friendly and helpful -- especially the adorable, little boy who took my order. He was so sweet, and helped me pick out what to eat on my first visit. I love that it's a small business, feels good knowing you're contributing to REAL people.  Today was my second time there, I tried their taco salad with carnitas -- life changing AF!  I never want to leave Vegas just because of this spot.  Best Hispanic food I ever ate, doesn't give me a sore stomach like other places, pretty sure it's because everything is fresh; and absolutely delicious.    The food looks and tastes incredible!  Action Bronson needs to put this spot on his show, F*ck that's Delicious!  So far I've tried: - Tacos with barbacoa and carnitas...out of this world AMAZING, and yet, so simple!  They even use yellow corn tortillas!  - Windy City Fries are to die for!  It's like food industry  GOLD, you'll want it in and all around your mouth.  I have no idea how those fries stay so crunchy!  They're magickal! A++++ - Taco Salad is GARGANTUAN, scrumptious and satiating.  I bet the list of tastiness doesn't stop there!  This is going to be our new spot after church from now on.  Mahalo, Chicago Style Taco Shop!  You guys are doing food right!  May your business thrive and be blessed with abundance and prosperity for a long time!  You bring happiness and good memories to people!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out this Mexican food. Ordered carnitas tacos and burrito. Brought home. Not very appetizing. Really greasy. Won't go back. GS"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! staff was super helpful and friendly!i felt like part of the family! food is fantastic!! will be here way more!!"}
{"text":"The carnitas and al pastor tacos were very good but the asada and barbacoa weren't. I'll definitely go back to try some tortas and to get more of the two tacos that I did like."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here and got the Windy city fries and nachos. They were both delicious ! Will definitely be coming here again to try more of their food !"}
{"text":"They always look out for the money team!! We appreciate you guys! Love their spicy hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices. The Windy City fries are to die for and the chicken tacos are so juicy and amazing! Definitely going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Yelp served me well tonight; the tacos here are excellent, as was the torta.  I strongly recommend the Cecina and Pastor options; I will be coming back for those many times."}
{"text":"I came here and got the guac and chips, carne asada tacos, and my bf for the al pastor tacos!! It was family owned and they had all members of their family helping and I thought that was awesome. I really enjoyed it and will come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while in the neighborhood for work. Had a great selection of proteins. Small shop in a nondescript strip mall.   Lots of options and had a hard time deciding on what to get. Ended up with the small portion of the Windy City fries. Only 5.99 but the portion was well worth more. Nice charred carne asada with great flavor and fresh toppings. Pico and guac were flavorful and delicious. The full portion for 11.99 would've been a good challenge but will take that on next time.   Service was fast and friendly. Quality was right on point. Will be sure to stop by again when back in the neighborhood. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to try out the Chicago Style Taco Shop. When we arrived I was a little taken a back as it was part of a convenience store, but OMG! so glad we went inside. The food was just amazing, I had the carnitas torta and 2 tripas tacos and I was not disappointed one bit. I think I can safely say this is one of, if not the best taco shops in the city. The torta was perfect with the cheese melted perfectly unto the bread and carnitas were perfection. The tacos were way bigger than expected, flavor was beyond delicious, tripas were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crispness. And last but not least the red salsa was not only spicy it had flavor that paired with the meats.  I could go on, but to sum it up this little gem is about to become part of my weekly routine, I am excited to try more of the menu! Oh and the customer service was spot on"}
{"text":"Stumbled in for lunch and they were  pretty packed. Since I'm from the Chi I definitely had to see if they're using our name correctly! Welp I'd say they're not false advertising! I was VERRRRYYYYY skeptical at 1st. The cashier/order taker spoke limited English, so getting my order across correctly was a challenge. Then, while waiting on my order, she gave me another customers order, thank God the lady was friendly about the MIX up because I'd opened all of her food, but I hadn't touched it. Still I probably wouldn't have wanted it. After about 15mins she got my order out to me 6 tacos. 4 plain tacos and 2 w/lettuce, onion, cilantro. They came out piping out and smelling delicious!!!!! They also were made correctly!!!! We dined inside and the cashier w/limited English was friendly while we dined in. I'd go back! Prices weren't too bad. 6 tacos were $12. And they were filled nicely."}
{"text":"After driving to what we consider our favorite taco shop in town and realizing it would be about a 40 minute wait we quickly \"yelped\" another taco shop near us and came across Chicago Style Taco Shop. We were excited to see el pastor on the menu and ordered the fries with this meat and two carne asada tacos. The food was amazing and salsas were even better. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times dining in and have had a positive experience each time so far.  I really enjoy the Pastor tacos.  They have great flavor and are priced nice as well.  I have also had the fries (like a chili fry but with everything on them - you pick the meat.  It was also tasty.   The folks working here are nice, the place was clean and the food was good and reasonable in pricing.  I think I will make it a regular lunch place.   A good find"}
{"text":"Wow,wow,wow! I was told this place has some of the best tacos in Las Vegas...and they were right!  I was surprised how big the tacos were and how much meat there was in each taco. The taste of the tacos is what really surprised me. They have got to be some of the best tacos i have tasted in Vegas.   I had four of them and to be honest i was full on the third one but they were so good that i just had to eat the last one.  I will be back in the future, and really recommend Chicago style taco shop if your In the mood for some good tacos."}
{"text":"Favorite taco shop in Las Vegas!!!! I don't even know where to begin.  We first had Chicago Style Tacos at a catered wedding we attended, and were blown away by the amazing flavors! Ever since that wedding, we have been going to Chicago Style Taco Shop at least once every few weeks. We just can't get enough! The service is fast and friendly, and the food is delicious and affordable. What could be better!"}
{"text":"It's been some time since I've had a new, good taco experience. I had the opportunity to look for one tonight with several other Yelpers, so I took it.  Chicago Style Taco Shop is in a little North Las Vegas strip mall on Craig Rd, cross-street Ferrell (_not_ in the spacious plaza with Smith's and whatnot). The restaurant itself is pretty much a hole in the wall too, with seats for perhaps twenty. Even the cash register is on a narrow ledge, with the credit card machine closer to where the customer tends to stand than where the cashier does.  The owner and his wife were the only ones working. They moved to Chicago but came back to start this business, and they seem nice. I got offered free samples after I'd inquired about their Taco Tuesday specials (which are $1.50 but just for the ground beef and chicken), and those cups that I received were at least one-third of the actual protein of a taco.  The menu has pretty much everything that you'd expect in a casual Mexican restaurant: tacos, tortas, burritos, taco salads, quesadillas, a few breakfast and dinner options, desserts, and traditional drinks. There are also nachos and something that they call Windy City Fries ($5.99 for a \"small\" and $11.99 for what must be an unimaginably large portion). Gotta say that the fries themselves had a great balance of crunchy exterior and fluffy interior, and they were decked out with plenty of meat and toppings (cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream in sauce form). I could see myself ordering fries on my own, so thanks a ton to Stefany V for sharing tonight!  All of the tacos (whether $2.50 for certain premium proteins or $2 for the rest) come with a double-stack of corn tortillas, oiled and fried (but not to a crispy), plus your choice of veggies (had to go with onion and cilantro instead of lettuce and tomato, the latter of which feels too Americanized) and salsas on the side. The tomatillo salsa is mild, but the other sauces (the seedless green one and red sauce) were medium/hot (depending on your palate) and were somewhat uncomfortable to use. I tend to prefer spots that pick the salsa to complement the meat because it becomes a guessing game for a first-time customer like me to make the right choice.  I ended up trying most of their proteins, and I'll list/tier them from my most to least favorite:  - Tripas: intestines can be weird to some, but these burst with flavor and may be my new favorite because they're less overpoweringly salty than what I expected.  - Pastor: out of the tacos, these were my second favorite. They're the rendition with caramelized onions, and they're on par with the only other pastor tacos in this style that I've had (which at another local taqueria, actually). The meat is moist and delicious. - Barbacoa: made from beef cheeks and a perfect topping for Windy City Fries. Gotta love the fat. Wish I'd had this on a taco to see how well it would've worked out. - Cecina: this is actually a refried beans sandwich, with the tortillas as one bun and a giant hunk of tender beef as the second bun. Visually impressive and also flavorfully satisfying.  - Asada: didn't enjoy this diced steak too much on the taco because it wasn't marinated as far as I could tell, but it worked great with Windy City Fries. - Pescado: could flip flop this with the asada. Big hunk of slightly dry fish that didn't have that much flavor alone, but picked up a lot of flavor with the tomatillo salsa.  - Chorizo: finely ground seasoned pork. Better than the one other version that I've tried in that it really bursts with flavor without being too salty. - Carnitas: kinda on the dry side, which is an unfortunate trend that I've noticed with carnitas in general. Lots and lots of protein on a carnitas taco though. - Picadillo: ground beef. It's marinated and has corn and green beans (perhaps among other veggies), but it was underseasoned. - Lengua: beef tongue. just not much flavor here, with zero caramelization in the gray meat. Ranked this so low because it's one of the premium tacos.  - Pollo: chicken. Underseasoned. Enough said.  Overall, I experienced enough hits that I could see myself easily returning... but only if I ever found myself in the neighborhood. It's a great local taqueria for people residing in this part of North Las Vegas or in neighborhoods even more distant from the heart of Las Vegas. Otherwise, just bookmark this for when you're really that bored of all the other options."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little restaurant! I went at around 11AM on a Friday.  The place is small but there are about 8 tables in there.  It's family owned and everyone chips in.  The little fella that was the cashier, Julian was the BEST! Great customer service and he was really knowledgeable on the items.  I loved the windy city fries! Be warned that the small is pretty large! I would definitely go back..."}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping complex as this taco shop. My boss get tacos once a week minimum from here so one day I decided to see what was so great about this place. I am very glad I finally decided to give them a try. The food is delicious, so are their sauces. The place is very clean and staff is extremely friendly. If you like Tacos you need to give this place a try. You will not regret it, I know I didn't!!"}
{"text":"After having Roberto's carne asada fries for the one-trillionth time (they can only satisfy your cravings for so long), I decided to try this place out after seeing it pop up on my Yelp a couple times.  Location:  This is a fairly new business and has, to my knowledge, been only open for a few months. It is a very hole-in-the-wall place and you sort of have to look to find it. If you see a shop that has a sign on top saying \"Carnitas Taco Shop\", you've reached the place! Don't worry, I'm not lying to you. If you look at the door sign, you'll see that it's Chicago Style Taco Shop. The interior is honestly like how you expect a small, family-owned taco shop to look like. Almost every time I've gone, I've noticed the same people - most likely the family members of the owner - having dinner and relaxing in the shop, which really help make the shop feel more homey.   Service:  The owner, a man who greets you happily right when you enter the door, is so sweet! The first time I visited, he had no problem answering our questions. You could tell he has a lot of love and passion for the food he makes. When we were waiting for our food and there were no more customers up by the register, he took no time helping the cook make orders and make sure the quality was up to par.  Food: Tacos: The tacos were also cooked to order and were served piping hot. The meats were juicy. You could even request a choice of salsas, red or green, to top them with.   Windy City Fries: Though I still do not know the difference between Chicago Style fries and regular carne asada fries, I've officially converted from Roberto's. You can choose between a small (better to eat by yourself) and a large (to share). You get to choose the meat and cheese to go along with these fries and everything is made to order. After much deliberation, my cousin and I settled on a large thinking we were hungry enough to finish it. The large was more than enough between the two of us, and we even had enough to take home for a snack! The fries were cooked to perfection, not too crispy and not too soggy. The toppings - pico de gallo, guacamole, meat, cheese, onions, etc. -  were loaded on top and were more than enough to fill every bite with a burst of flavor. Why go to Roberto's when you could just drive a couple more miles to eat this plate of heaven? I may not know the actual difference between Chicago Style and Roberto's Style, but my mouth sure did!  I have officially turned into a fan of this shop. I see a lot of potential and I hope more people discover this place soon. It deserves to be recognized for the amazing food, service, and quality it has. Writing this review caused my cravings for their delicious food to shoot up, my mouth to salivate, and my stomach to grumble. I guess I know where I'm going for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of guacamole in my Carne as ada fresh fries, but the guacamole here is on point. I would definitely give that a try. The steak Taco wasn't anything special but it wasn't terrible either."}
{"text":"First time at this tacos place and I had a wonderful experience at Chicago Style Tacos.  Great service and great food!  I will definitely come back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great quality Mexican food. Love the pastor and the asada tacos. Windy City fries are the bomb and Tortas is a must try.. I'm having my lunch there today."}
{"text":"Service was great, Horchata was really good, burrito was pretty messy with a lot of juices going everywhere and the tortilla split on the side but the flavor was great. I definitely recommend this place for good authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Before heading to EDC, my friend and I stopped by Chicago Style Taco Shop for dinner. If we weren't in a hurry to beat the traffic, we would've dined-in. There are a bunch of comfy leather bar stools, which made it harder for me to want to leave. Good call, CSTS!  I ordered the Tacos Combo (fish, steak, and chorizo), which includes 3 tacos with your choice of protein with rice, beans, and a drink. My drink of choice was a mandarin Jarritos. All 3 of my tacos were decently good. The steak and fish ones were a little dry, but nothing a little salsa couldn't fix. By the way, I chose their red salsa. My favorite of the 3 was the chorizo taco -- because it was a little spicy and well seasoned.  The Tacos Combo was very filling, and it only cost me about $10!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! The meats were cooked perfectly and the salsa was tasty, perfect for a hot day."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first time. Went in and there was a family already eating but nobody else there. I walked right up and once I made my decision, started ordering. It was REALLY hard to order because the TV was so loud. The didn't have any more green onions, they were also out of flan. So that was disappointing.  My order consisted of: -3 tacos (chile relleno, carnitas, and cecino) -horchata -fries with carne asada  My favorite out of all of those was the chile relleno taco. My sister wants to try this place after I showed her the menu so we will stop by again."}
{"text":"Came to Chicago Style Tacos on Craig for the first time and the service was excellent and the food delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! And the staff very chill and funny. Portions are huge, quality is guaranteed and the price is friendly!"}
{"text":"In town from LA and was looking for something quick to hold me and my buddy over until dinner. Stopped by and tried pastor, Asada, chicken, carnitas and chorizo and was pretty damn satisfied. The tacos are big and meaty, and taste great. The nachos were huge too. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Homemade guacamole. Street tacos are great. Good variety of meat. Horchata is good. They also have carnasada fries. Overall a great quick bite if you don't want robertos. Salsa is food. Very authentic food."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 4. The people were nice, especially after they kind of messed up the order a bit. (They did make up for it)  Tacos are delicious. Definite favorites were the pastor and barbacoa. The carne asada was great as well. The meat was tender and juicy with little need of actual hot sauce.  The fries were deliciously seasoned and full of meat. Definitely could only finish half of a small platter. It's quite substantial for one person.  The one thing that really didn't hit home was the atmosphere. It felt like a regular taco shop that had a couple things decorated to make it look like Chicago. If ambience was changed, I would've stayed longer.  Outside of that, I would definitely come back and order again."}
{"text":"Coming from san diego, the windy city fries are on point. After living overseas and different parts of the US. This pretty much is the closes thing to home. 2nd time here and never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food , pretty down to earth fresh , location is a 50/50 shot at success and competition is strong in this market"}
{"text":"I really like eating here a lot with my kiddos. The food is good! Everything is freshly made from the salsa to the marinate for the meats."}
{"text":"Good tacos! I was pretty impressed, my favorites were cecina and asada. They use yellow corn tortillas which I think taste way better. They offer three tasty salsas two spicy and one mild. I will be recommending to all who are looking for delicious tacos."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced, they rarely open when they say they do, after 10:00 am. I've been at 10:15 and the door is locked.   I've had better tacos, and I've lived in Mexico, so, I just thought they were ok. Tacos El Gordo is WAY more authentic, and my go to, now. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Real friendly people. Ask for Joe. Great guy and knows how to take care of you!"}
{"text":"Came here just because the Chicago style tacos caught my attention.  As soon as in went inside I was welcomed by the owner who was super nice.  I got the  3 taco meal with rice, beans, and a drink for $8.99. The tacos were delicious and the chips and salsa was very fresh.  I recommend this place if your into street tacos."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best tacos I've ever had. The Windy City Fries were also the business. Large order feed 4 of us in the office. Will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their tacos are juicy and seasoned! I be waiting for the next bus, just to treat myself to their awesome food!"}
{"text":"Back open and yummy as ever. The windy city fries are the best ever."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp, read some reviews and decided to try it out. The restaurant is located in a newer strip mall. It's small but there's a good amount of seating. The kitchen is open so you can see them prepare your food while you're at the counter. The young lady who helped us was very personable, welcoming and helpful. I explained it was my first time there and she took the time to go over the menu, explained the options and even pointed out the popular dishes which is always helpful. She was very patient as it took me awhile to finally decide what I want. (Never go to a restaurant when you're already starving!!) I ordered the Windy City fries, a variety of 6 tacos and jamaica to go. The tacos are street style which I love and they were delicious. I got the carnitas, pollo and barbacoa tacos. The Windy City Fries were delicious as well. I didn't know what to expect at first but wow!! They were very flavorful and filling. The small size is more than enough to share.   The restaurant was clean. It looks pretty new. Everyone was nice and welcoming. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came by this place just by driving by and being hungry. Stopped in, ordered a steak burrito and didn't regret it at all. Freshly cooked food and a satisfied stomach."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy classic street tacos with an amazing flavor profile! Yum! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"No one was there dining in, but us.  A few people had phone orders who came by to pick up their food.  Tacos were delicious .  Would go again, but maybe not for dine in uncles their AC works."}
{"text":"Came to try the windy city fries they were amazing to die for must try, customer service is great super nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"Omg customer service is well over expectations and food is so yummy. My kids are picky eaters and they ate everything. They make you feel so welcome unlike many other restaurants who see you as one more order. My friends, and our kids all enjoyed dinning there.  I can't say it enough great customer service and even better food. You won't regret it. I've had my husband pick up an order for dinner few days after. He can't believe how yummy their food was. Definitely our new take out place."}
{"text":"Come hungry! Nachos pastor freshly made and delicious. Huge portion freshly grilled meat, fresh toppings, house made salsas, crisp chips....great meal. This place is a local find. Keep these guys cooking!"}
{"text":"Food is so delicious! The price is very affordable. The staff is awesome too they always ask if I have any questions and I love that because they recommend things to me!"}
{"text":"Great tripas tacos and amazing carne asada windy city fries! I highly recommend the fries with nacho cheese. So yum! I'm planning on getting the tripas fries next.   We got four of the special tacos, a torta, and carne asada fries for about $23."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I order the lengua tacos which are my favorite taco meat but the lengua was not shredded like most places the lengua was actually a full piece of meat. Not very satisfying. I also had carnitas taco, Which was very dry. I also had a barbcoa taco, which is a little more juicy. And one small barbcoa quesadilla which was good but very very oily. Their sauce was great. And the horchata just tasted like the powder form.   Saw the reviews on yelp. So I decided to try this place out. The restaurant is very small. The appearance of the restaurant sure made it look like a hole in the wall spot which is what usually makes a restaurant great!. But overall the restaurant wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Small shop, flavorful and inexpensive tacos. The cashier and cook were very friendly and even check to see how your meal was. The have 4 specialty sauces that range from mild to very spicy.   If your looking for authentic homemade tacos this is the place."}
{"text":"Been craving pastor tacos for the last few days so when my wife told me she wanted nachos for dinner I hopped on Yelp. I came accross this place and saw a almost 5 star raiting with almost 200 reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. The food is awesome and the customer service was on point. I can see if this place were to be super busy they could take a while, but the food is made to order. It's NOT fast food. This definetly isn't the closest taco spot to me but after trying it, it's going to be my go to spot. Great job CSTS."}
{"text":"After seeing this place on a recent Yelp email blast and seeing how close it was to my work I knew it was meant to be that I come here for lunch. It's located in a little strip mall down the street a little from Craig ranch park.   When you walk in it's super small and kind of a dive aka you know it's going to be delicious. All their tacos are made fresh as soon as you order and they provide you with three different salsas as well. Personally I loved the thicker green salsa which was similar to a spicy guacamole type.   I decided to go with three asada tacos and let me just say they were amazing. Each taco was only $2 or you could get a combo which included three tacos, rice, beans and a drink. The tacos were super fresh and flavorful. They come the traditional way with onions and cilantro. I added a mix of the green and red salsas, bomb.   I can't wait to come back here and try some other meats. So excited to have this so near by for lunch time!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here.  Cool little hole in the wall with very nice owners/employees and great food.  I got three tacos and the windy city fries and all were really good.  Price is fair and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The tacos were great!  You can choose between american style - lettuce/ tomato topping or traditional with onions/ cilantro. So much flavorful meat. I woukd totally recommend and be baxl when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A highly recommended this place to anyone looking for a tasty mexican dish. The food quality is just great here, the Carne Asada was cooked just right and had just rich taste. The guacamole has a nice texture to it. For the quality of the food here and the price, it's just a must to come here and get a quick bite. I loved the food here and the owner is a very nice man. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Finally a good taco shop in Vegas. The staff was really nice and the area looked clean."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! From the moment we stepped in to when we left, everything was such a good experience. First, they are in a plaza that you cane easily drive past so pay attention to where it's at. Its pretty small inside, but of course hole in the wall places are always the best. The cashier was so nice, she helped us pick out our meat and also gave us samples of all their freshly made drinks. We chose the tacos- chicken, carne asada, and barbacoa. We also ordered the fries since we wanted to see what all the fus was about. The chicken was ok, a little dry, maybe wouldn't get that again. The barbacoa was AMAZING; tender, juicy, and all around bomb! Carne asada wasn't anything to rave about since it's pretty much a staple at all taquerias. The cashier recommended next time to try chorizo and cecina. Definitely will be coming back and trying their different meats. Their green sauce is amazing as well. They usually give 3 sauces, green that's mild and a red and green sauce that has a little more kick. I'm a huge fan of the medium green sauce, it adds to much more flavor to their already flavorful tacos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town with, Chicago twist to the menu! Street tacos were served on yellow corn tortilla and were delicious! Very friendly atmosphere and great service! Must try if you love Mexican food!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in was immediately greeted by awesome staff. As I was new I was offered to sample different meat. We opted for the Carne Asada Torta, and the Windy City Fries 2 meat loaded with everything. They have soda and bottle water options for people like me. The gem is hidden in a strip mall on Craig so def be on the lookout for it. The parking is ample. Inside was clean. If they offer suggestions I would def try them out, as in here they really know their menu... Very pleased"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not crazy expensive. Place was nice. Would prefer everyone dealing with the food wearing hair nets."}
{"text":"Esta vez decidí probar unos tacos y así llegue a este lugar probé los tacos de asada por cierto muy ricos y la salsa no se diga mi hija decidió probar una torta a mi gusto es muy sencilla no le ponen aguacate cebolla  ni tomate pero pasaba estuvimos esperando demasiado para para unos tacos y una torta pero cave decir que tardan por son recién hechos"}
{"text":"Best tacos in north Vegas!! The pastor tacos are freaking bomb. My bf last tried these tacos 2 years ago before his deployment and a few days ago we went and he still thinks they haven't changed :)"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, informative and a pleasure to eat there. The food was delicious. I will certainly be returning to try more of their menu! I had the chicken burrito. And my daughter had the BBQ pork. All the ingredients were fresh and top quality. You've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy this place every once in a while. The carne asada fries with both cheeses are delicious. We just always forget to ask for beans with our fries. Wish they would just add them or ask if we want them."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Super fresh food, a little hole in the wall spot but don't let that phase you the food is amazing and full of flavor! The owner is super nice as are his waiters :)"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp, came here for lunch and brought a coworker. The staff was great, very friendly mom-pop Chicago based taco place. I ordered 4 tacos and all of them were amazing. I love love the yellow corn tortillas versus the white and they serve yellow here. Yellow tortillas have a better taste.  I ordered lengua, chile relleno, al pastor, barbacoa, tripitas. My favorite was barbacoa, the tender and well spiced meat is my favorite personally.  The ambient was great, upbeat music, top 40 which I really liked. The cook was dancing and singing along to Taylor Swift and I'm a fan!! I would totally come back here, tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Best little taco shop on the NW side of town!!! Their carne Asada is amazing!!! And not to mention their fresh salsas!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the day and instead of going to our usual place, we decided to try this place instead. It was definitely worth the 30min. Drive we had to do from where we were at.   First and foremost, the staff were super friendly. They treat us so well!!   We had Al Pastor, chorizo, carne asada, chicken, barbacoa, cecina and chile relleno tacos. They were ALL amazing. Our favorites though were al pastor, barbacoa, and chile relleno.   Hats off to the chef!!!   The green salsa that we used was pretty good. We added it to all the tacos.   If you've never tried a Jericalla, I suggest you try it. It's kind of like flan, just not as sweet.   Just overall...an amazing little place."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Windy City Fries size small and couldn't finish it all. Clean place, food was cooked in my view."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite taco shops for sure, the food is amazing and service is top notch. I recommend the windy city fries and the chicken quesadillas are to die for!! You'll make it regular stop once you've tried it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Owner is a great guy and the food is delicious. You can taste the difference between a place like this one and the competitor franchises. Hole in the wall, so don't expect fancy water fountains and waiters in tuxedos lmao. Have realistic expectations for a hole in the wall taco shop, and I promise you won't be disappointed lol"}
{"text":"This place was worth the drive!  We had the chile releno, al pastor and the chorizo taco!  Best tacos I've had in Vegas, better than Tacos el Gordo!  Owner was friendly and hospitable!  Great food, great sauces and wonderful customer service!  Will definitely be back for more.... My new crave!"}
{"text":"The entire staff greeted us when we walked in, they were friendly & attentive. I love that the kitchen is open for you to see them cook. The food came out quickly. Hand down best taco I've had in Vegas so far.   My only complaint is the size. For the amount of people in there it's pretty small but even with limited space, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great little spot right inside the gas station, you would be amazed, clean little spot, great place to just pick up a snack or sit down and enjoy a meal. Tacos were amazing and they had the service to match!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with some friends. Food was great. Service was awesome. I'm super excited to come back and try something new. After moving here from California almost 2 years ago this is the now one of my favorite places to eat. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by based on reviews on yelp. We were greeted by the owner who was super friendly. We were curious as to what made the tacos Chicago-style and he kindly explained that the tortillas were hand made especially for his shop (which were delicious)and he cooked everything they made in-house. I got the pastor windy city fries with mozzarella and nacho cheese and they were the best fries I've had in my life! Also got the thin-salted steak tacos which were amazing. He even gave us some Champurrado on the house to try and it was really tasty. Finally an awesome taco spot in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is super good and non expensive. This is my first time and definitely not my last"}
{"text":"Went today with my wife and friend got tacos, Asada/pastor fries and Asada burrito. The meat was flavorless. The Asada was burnt. I am definitely dissatisfied because I opted out of going to my usual spot to try this new spot. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Chicago style windy fries have got to be one of the best Carne Asada fries in Las Vegas. I absolutely love crinkle cut fries and Chicago style taco shop uses crinkle cut fries to make their Asada fries. You can choose any kind of meat you want for your fries two different kinds of cheese, and the portion they give you is really good.  If you haven't tried Chicago style taco shop then you need to take a trip down there and try their food which is really delicious. I highly recommend this place, try it for yourself you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The owners are wonderful people and the Windy City salty boys are the best asada salty boys that I've had in the city. I got the small order and it was more than filling, which was surprising because I can eat the whole size order at Roberto's. So I saved a few dollars on the order and, oh man, was it so much better than any Roberto's salty boys/nachos that I've eaten. I don't live too close but it's close enough that I will make the drive anytime I want some real comfort food."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 taco combos . Everything tasted really good. The lady who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  One of the better taco shops in Northwest  Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Not many taco places on this side of town other than dominant chains (u know who's). I had a plate w 3 taco choice. I got steak & chicken. Good serving of meat in each taco, they were hot & fresh even at 8pm! Steak was tasty, chicken was seasoned well & not dry - which is not the usual at other places! I even liked the rice (which I usually don't). Friendly service, reasonable prices. Been driving by all the time & saw the good reviews, glad we finally tried it! Doesn't hurt I'm from Chicago so I def tasted home !"}
{"text":"I had asada tacos.  The meat tasted old and way too greasy"}
{"text":"Got the barbacoa burrito and a chorizo taco. That taco was great but the meat for the burrito was dry and had no flavor to it"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Loved the tacos, and nachos and the salsa's are awesome!!! And so friendly too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food and excellent service! My husband had the Chicago fries with carne asada, and I had the barbacoa nachos. So yummy! Waaaay better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town, they just catered my baby shower more food then I could ask for, and people can't stop talking about how great the food was!!!!!!"}
{"text":"An awesome find! My husband is a native of Los Angeles and says this competes with the best in his old neighborhood. The staff was amazing! Very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. We both had 3 taco plates so we could sample as many meats as we could.  The carnitas and pastor we our favorites. Don't pass up the cecina--it melts in your mouth!  Definitely adding this place to our rotation."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this taco shop on yelp. Decided to stop by since it is the highest rated food joint in the area-- and for good reason. Got the Windy City fries. The small is enough for 2-3 people. Portions are really generous. Chicken was extremely juicy. Ask for lime to squeeze over the top. Definitely set it off. It was BOMB!! Staff was very welcoming too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem of Las Vegas. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food is amazing especially the Windy City fries are a must!"}
{"text":"I order 4 tacos and a small quesadilla. I have previously gone to their other location and nonetheless it taste just as great. This definitely hit the spot. They are very filling as they are served with two tortillas. A must when around this area."}
{"text":"Despite some previous reviews, it is still open. Good tacos, great burritos, an amazing green hot sauce, and good customer service. You have to try the Chile relleno taco."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. The staff was great, and the owner is awesome. The windy city fries are BOMB. Everything was great, but I liked the chicken the best. A MUST try."}
{"text":"Good taco shop, the street-style tacos are awesome. They offer beef, chicken and pork, and give you the option of cilantro and onions. Overall a pretty simple combination, but that's what makes it awesome. You can order tacos individually, or get them with a meal that includes beans and rice. They also have breakfast options that includes burritos. The prices are a little steep compared to the last place that was here, and the wait is a little long, especially around lunch time when a crowd comes in and there is only one chef. I like to come here when I get off work if I'm feeling like tacos, but I had to stop coming in on my lunch break cause it was taking too long. All in all though, a good place."}
{"text":"This was by far the best burrito I've had in Las Vegas! Joe, the owner, was super friendly, caring and passionate about his customers and making them a quality burrito.  I tried both the carne asada burrito and the vegetarian burrito.  Both amazing options! As far the Veggie burrito, the beans were super flavorful.    Burritos cost around $6.50 and come with sour cream, cheese, tomato, onion and guac at no extra charge!   I would definitely recommend and I will be returning as a regular."}
{"text":"Hubs & I have been craving tacos, and this hit the spot. Definitely safe to say we found our go-to for tacos.   We got there around 5pm on a Saturday, and it was busy. Our food took about 30 minutes, but they kept apologizing and asking if everything was ok once we got our food. We didn't mind since we were really enjoying our food, which made the wait worth it. It was also a plus that the manager/owner even offered to let us try the barbacoa tacos and those were the bomb! The meat was soft and very flavorful. We'll be ordering those again!   Aside from the barbacoa, we ordered chicken, fish, & steak tacos. My husband is picky when it comes to meat, (doesn't like fatty pieces) but he ordered the thinly sliced steak tacos and approved! Even my picky 2 year old enjoyed her chicken quesadillas. They used \"beautiful pieces\" aka how we describe our chicken lol.  & The spicy avocado sauce is also a great addition on top of everything. It was a little too spicy for me, but I still kept adding more... it was that good!   Food and service were both amazing! We'll  be back soon!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out since it changed owners, because the last ones were nasty and had roaches everywhere. This place is definitely clean now. As for the food I took it to go, and I gotta say it was really good, got the Windy City fries half Asada, half barbacoa, they were both really good. Also got 3 tacos with tripe and they were also good and cooked perfect. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me to write.  I grew up in Chicago and when I saw this place I knew I had to go try it.  The food was good however they had hip-hop videos blasting on the TV.  I wouldn't have minded except it was a Sunday afternoon and I was there with my husband and for young kids.  The language and videos were very inappropriate for my kids who were all ages eight years old to one-year-old. I mean I'm talking vulgar images and language. Like I said if I wasn't there with my kids I would've just ignored it but definitely not cool when you're eating with your family"}
{"text":"The Windy City fries are the most amazing fries I have ever tasted!! One of those foods that make your \"O\" face shine with every bite!!!"}
{"text":"Second time back in a week and a half. I'm super happy my husband had us come back here last Tuesday!  Even though Tacos el Gordo is closer and more well known, I am now a HUGE fan of this place! More so than Gordo. The meat here is much better. I've tried the asada, cecina, pastor, lengua, barbacoa and carnitas. Every single taco is better than Tacos el Gordo. The meat isn't oily/greasy, and their salsas are great, too. The tortillas were just the right size for the amount of meat- which was overflowing.   When I came here last week with my husband, we each got the 4 taco combo. It comes with rice and beans, which I don't usually eat, but they were great. The rice was super fluffy and flavorful. The beans were creamy. I liked it, and thought them to be of the same quality as Lindo Michocan.... Maybe even a little better.  This time around, I got the 4 taco combo, little T got a small Windy City fry with just fries and pastor (hold the pineapple, please) and we also shared a side of chips and salsa. I love the salsa selections. The red is my favorite- super spicy! The chips were good too, not greasy and crunchy.   We came around 6 and there was steady traffic in and out, a combination of sit down and to-go orders. We didn't have to wait in line but we did have a bit of a wait to get our food. I'm good with that- it means it's fresh. And I know it is because you see them make it right behind the counter.   T's fries were so fresh and crispy! No pineapple either- thanks guys! My 4 plate combo was awesome, as it was before.   As stated before, I'm REALLY glad my husband had us go back. We'll be regulars here for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and this is definitely not Chicago style. I should have gone to Tacos El Gordo. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first but very impressed. The Windy City fries are great.  Also had the tacos and burrito. The green sauce is awesome be careful with the red it's fire.   The service was very friendly and I will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by with my boyfriend since it's a local spot and we were on our way to the movies. I was not disappointed! Not quite a Roberto's, although it is a Roberto's style just a tad bit better quality, quite a few more meat choices and street style tacos which are my favorite. The staff is super friendly and focused on how you want your food made. We got the asada & chorizo tacos with the Windy City fries, yumm!"}
{"text":"Best lengua tacos I've had in Vegas so far. My husband got the nachos and Chicago fries. They where both delicious as well. The owner or manager & waiter were really friendly."}
{"text":"People here were great but the food wasn't quite as good as I was hoping for. I say 4 star in total. I would definitely be will to try them again but it seems like when I'm in the mood I always forget about them."}
{"text":"Honestly best taco spot in north town. I fell in love with there Al Pastor Quesadilla. Cant complain. Its always good to support a small buisness so put yourself in there shoes & enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. Good price. Had the carne asada, pastor, and carnitas taco.  My favorite was the carne asada and pastor.  The cashier was hard to understand but very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was pretty warm.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here on whim , owner cooks everything fresh, good prices and great food! I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu! Give this place a try ! Great family owned spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco shops in town. They offer a variety of food in their menu. Im personally obsessed with their Windy City fries. Im a local and this is my go to place for quick and delicious mexican food."}
{"text":"The restaurant owner is a nice guy whose family has a few stores open in Chicago. The original Vegas location was downtown by CCDC, but they moved to Craig pretty recently. You can easily tell the owner is passionate about the food he makes - as he wrapped my burrito up, I couldn't help but think of the similarities to when Spongebob lovingly tucked his Krabby patties into their buns and read them a story. The sign on the storefront reads \"Carnitas Tacos\" but there's a small banner in the window that actually says \"Chicago Style Taco Shop\". Nestled in between an Asian market and a nail salon, this small taco shop is easy to miss!   WINDY CITY FRIES ($5.99, small): My husband loved this entree and trust me, a \"small\" is more than enough food! These fries are loaded up to the brim and make an excellent carry-out dinner. 5/5  NACHOS ($7.50, asada): Husband ordered this on his second visit and was a fan of this entree as well. He barely made a dent in this hefty serving of nachos. 5/5  VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($6.50): Comes with all the toppings stated on in the menu, (beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, tomato, avocado) plus rice. On my first visit, everything went off without a hitch. On my most recent visit, it went like this: Onions: 1, Me: 0. Onions seriously make me nauseous, like I will start gagging if I attempt to consume them. The cashier listed all the ingredients in the veggie burrito, and onions sure as hell wasn't one of them. I get home, and there's tiny diced onions freaking everywhere in the burrito! WHY? For the love of humanity and all things good, please do not add 'surprise' ingredients to my burrito. 3/5   There's no fountain drinks and the restaurant is pretty small, so I'd recommend getting take-out. Burritos to be honest, are on the smaller side (comparable to Frijoles and Frescas). I'm still definitely a fan of Chicago's Style Taco Shop, and am looking to trying more menu items. I see you horchata.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #268"}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food. It's greasy but flavorfull. We had the tongue taco and Barbacoa face both were really good. The Windy City fries are also an amazing deal we got the small and for me that was large enough for three people. Tortas we're alright. And if you like spicy salsa this place has it!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing ground beef nachos, fully loaded with cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream and avocado. It's a party in my mouth lol!!! I truly recommend it!!! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was good.  Will definitely be back.  Recommend the Windy City Fries."}
{"text":"took the family. everything was great! this is my new and fav. taco spot! great staff. very friendly."}
{"text":"Was told this place was awesome from a neighbor. They weren't lying. Friendly the second you walk in the door and the prices are great. The wife and I have been looking for some good carne asada tacos and these were top notch. All three of their sauces are tasty. Got a small windy city fries plate with chicken. Amazing. I'm still sitting here typing this review because? I couldn't stop eating all this delicious food. Oh and the horchata is the best I've had. It's worth the drive if you're not close."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been in Vegas for 7 months.  We have been to numerous places that swear they are authentic Mexican food and fall extremely short of being anywhere near authentic. We stumbled on this place this morning and not only was it delicious the customer service was amazing! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Everyone is always so nice when I come in for takeout. Their portions are generous and the food is delicious every time. Order is made fresh, but the wait is not long. Probably my favorite Mexican place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried Chicago Style Taco Shop on Craig for the first time and the service was excellent, the food was delicious and I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"My husband I went here for a quick bite to eat and we were not disappointed! We each got taco combo plate and they were great. We tried the Asada, Carnitas, Pastor & the chili Rellano tacos. They also have 3 house sauces to top your tacos with ---all fabulous. Great service! Mom and Pop taco shop! I would have given 5 stars but as we were leaving we saw they had a \"B\" rating  not sure why because this place was very clean, you can see the entire kitchen and prep area. Despite that we will still return here!"}
{"text":"Real nice people went into get a carne Asada fries they were really good pretty clean place will highly recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure for those of us who love Mexican food. An unassuming little spot, this place delivers tons of flavor with fresh, homemade dishes. We ordered 5 the Al pastor tacos, Windy City fries with steak and al pastor meat, and one large horchata... and this was plenty for 2 super hungry people.   There is great \"home\" feel to this spot, as the husband and wife who own it were taking care of everyone there. The food can take a minute, but it is WELL worth it.   Tip: Bring cash or pay $.50 fee for credit card use."}
{"text":"Small family business in North Las Vegas. My favorite is their windy city fries. Fully loaded with your choice of meat (carne asada is on point) topped with guac, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese with side of mild and hot salsa. Haven't tried their street tacos yet because I always come for their fries. I've also had their nachos but chips were not as crispy, it had some corners of chewiness so I rather get the fries!"}
{"text":"This place is doing wonders, I have passed it so many times over the years and actually never knew this place was so great or for that matter even cared to give it a shot. What a mistake!  The food is amazing, we tried the loaded fries and all I can say is stop reading and go get it. The portion is huge and the toppings are plenty. Also grabbed a ground beef Quesadilla and it was also huge and the flavor was unique and a breath of fresh air. I would usually pass up a Mexican food shop but this one was worth every penny as its sort of like a fusion between american and Mexican.  The hot sauces they provide are all homemade and they stamp a sticker on the containers so you know when they were prepared. The Green, Red, and they had this other sauce that I kid you not tasted like Raviolis to me. Go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped by cause we went to the Asian store and discovered a hidden gem! Super nice owner, Joe, took over former taco shop and its amazing! Tried the carne asada taco and its on a home made corn tortilla! Sampled the Pastor w/pineapple and decided to give the windy city fries a try. Very tasty!!! We will be back! This is a mom and pop type shop and every one should try it! I haven't tried much but what we did try was great!"}
{"text":"One Word: AMAZING!!!  Carne Asada was cooked perfectly, their portions are large, and the service was awesome!!!  I got delicious food and made a friend!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food! We tried the Barbacoa, Asada, Pastor and Lengua. All of the meat were hearty and not greasy at all! The rice and beans combo was a smaller portion than other restaurants but the quality and flavor made up for it. Anyway, you really shouldn't have so much rice and beans ;)  We loved the variety of sauces. I fell in love with the avocado sauce and they preferred the spicy habanero.   The sodas were cold and the place was clean. It's a fast food place not a fancy diner so don't expect a chandelier...lol   Their service was great. Both the cashier and the cook interacted with us and asked for our feedback. I took some stuff home and it traveled well. Just wish I had asked for more salsa in the bag. It was really tasty.  Definitely recommend! The barbacoa was my favorite meat but I did enjoy the quality of all the meats we tried. I can't wait to go back and try the Chicago spacial and the fries.  Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"It was cool. The woman taking our order was super friendly and helpful. It's a tiny place and it filled up quickly! We enjoyed the nacho papas but the tacos are the real star!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot during our road trip, really good and fresh Mexican food. The service was great as well as the food, salsas were bomb!"}
{"text":"Waited over half an hour for 3 fish tacos and the restaurant was not event busy. I really wanted to try out a new place.The tacos were not worth the long wait...... Super disappointed I really can't understand the hype behind this taco shop."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I was hesitant to give it a 5 star.  However, the food has the same quality everytime you go.  The windy city fries, the tacos, and the burrito all exceed Robert's taco shop.  I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is my new go to burrito/taco restaurant. It's super close to my house so I choose to go here over roberto's or don tortaco. Let's be honest, you can't really go wrong with mexican food especially when it's made by people who know that they are doing. I always get the asada burrito and pour all 3 sauces all over it!! All the flavors blended together makes the burrito 10x better. They've done a lot of renovations and improvements to make their restaurant cleaner and more modern.  I acknowledge other people's concerns that they may have experienced at this place, but every time I come here, I've been treated so well by all their employees. I hope others will give them a second chance. Support your small businesses!"}
{"text":"Hard to find, it's under the Carnita's Taco Shop sign. Hope they change the sign soon so they are easier to find. Tacos were delicious, my wife had already told me she's going to crave them"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got so many good reviews.   For being a fast food type place it took a long time for them to make the order and it was colder in the restaurant than it was outside.   If you plan on eating from here order by phone and wait about 40 mins  I liked that the burritos had lettuce beans and tomatoes in them but my al pastor burrito was primarily just that. Where was the meat?  We ordered the small Chicago style fires with ground beef and there were chunks of ground beef so burnt and charred that it was hard as a rock.   The portions are good for the price you pay.   I think this place has a lot of potential but not sure I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Perhaps I haven't frequented much Mexican establishments, but I'm giving this place 4 stars for serving me tacos so fresh that it was hot picking up my taco, that I had to put it down to let it cool a bit.   Husband and I decided to stop in after our little afternoon date. We were the only ones in there...so we were immediately greeted by a woman who seemed pretty jolly.   We didn't order the windy city french fries as everyone else in the reviews have raved about. I mean, at the end of it all...you're pretty much eating french fries with all the Mexican fixings. Quite frankly, I wasn't in a french fry mood anyway. I wanted me some tacos.  Between the 2 of us we ordered, 2 Carne asada tacos, 1 lengua, 2 barbacoas, and a carnitas. You have the choice of either lettuce and tomatoes orrrr cilantro and onions in your taco. We opted for the cilantro and onions. I absolutely LOVE how they give lots of cilantro. Some places I've been to give you lots of onions and some cilantro. As a cilantro lover...I noticed it immediately and was like, hallelujuer.   The lengua (tongue) was the husband's. Definitely not something of my fancy. Lengua is served in 2 thin slices versus the typical chopped up version you'll normally see. Husband thought it didn't make too much of a difference sliced vs chopped. He enjoyed it. Typical. He said the barbacoa was on point and couldn't get enough of it.  I had the Carne tacos. I enjoyed it, but I thought it was a little on the salty side. We arrived fter watching a movie...perhaps the salt in the popcorn was still lingering in zee mouth?? Impossible. Although twas a tad saltier than expected...it was certainly edible, yet, still found it to be pretty good. Hungry much? My carnitas was definitely the winner for me on this round. Perfectly seasoned, had the right char to it...twas certainly my fave between the two.   We were also given 3 different bottles of their sauces to go with the tacos. Don't know the names but I'm assuming each bottle is named, spicy as hell, spicy as hell, oh...and spicy as hell. We also ordered chips and salsa....spicy as helllll. I'm not a professional spicy as hell eater, but I can take a little heat. All their sauces and their salsa was spicy as hell. Moral of story, if you want a little hair on your chest, then hair on your chest shall be granted. Jokes aside, the creamy light green bottle was the most spiciest between 'em 3.  We spent about 20 bucks between the two of us for 6 tacos, a large horchata, and some coconut candy my husband couldn't resist. He is a huge coconut lover.   Will we be back? If I'm in the mood for some tacos, most definitely! Personally prefer this place than Taco El Gordo, hands down. Stop dropping your jaw, gotta read my El Gordo review to understand why. I think there is literally just 1 cook, and your food may take a little longer than you'd expect, depending how busy they are...but it'll always come out FRESH, which is important to me.  They offer small sizes for the quesadilla and other items which is great if you have children.  I recommend not ordering to go unless you live real close or else you'll miss out on the fresh serve. Then you'll spend your time griping on yelp.  If you need a taco fix, taco salad fix, quesadilla fix...it's definitely worth the try!  They're certainly kid and stroller friendly! Just don't roll up in those double, side-to-side kind of stroller."}
{"text":"The salsa was amazing! I ordered a taco place and got carne Asada, carnitas and el pastor! They were all very good but the pastor was my favorite! Will definitely be making the trip back for more tacos! The nachos were a huge portion with even layers through out the plate !"}
{"text":"Crappy customer service! I was trying to find out how he packed my tacos because I was handed 3 foiled & I had one that was fish. Anyone should know not to package fish on their own not unless asked because it was package with a steak taco.. someone that's eating the steak taco could have a seafood allergy & it's contaminated!  The cook kept touching his clothes, such as his baggy pants & never changed his gloves afterwards.   & once I left, there was two customers waiting for their food & as I left out, the cook started to talk about me because I wanted to know how my order was packaged together!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is amazing. The tacos are ridiculously good and the Burritos are crazy good, the best breakfast burrito is with their chorizo its the best chorizo in town."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm amazed, surprised,  etc... My buddy from work said it's better that Tacos El Gordo. I was like, I got to check this out. Had the tripe tacos! Phenomenal! Definitely way better than El Gordos! I've found my new taco shop..."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I tried it on a whim and now love the Windy City fries are GREAT half portion is very filling, and affordable ! They are very generous with portions, i even tried the chicken tamale and omg !! So good I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This taco shop was decent the music was great environment was alright but I have had better tacos. I won't go out of my way to go back but if I was near by I will probably grab a taco. Thanks for having the jams when all 30 of the mini bikes came"}
{"text":"Without reservation, this is the best taco shop in Vegas. Homemade salsas are fresh and dated brought to you right from a cooler. The Chicago spin doesnt take from what makes traditional down home tacos great.. my favorite meat has to be the pastor, simply delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good people running the joint.  Love myself some Al Pastor, these guys do it right.  Surprisingly hard to find Al Pastor this good with Pineapple.  Not too fatty either, good quality"}
{"text":"I'm a Chicagoan myself and these tacos are the best tacos in town and definitely close to the tacos from back home Chicago. Juan the cook was an amazing gentleman and provided great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken tacos and ground beef tacos, they were decent. Not bad but not great either. The staff were really nice and the location is easy to miss. Why is it so hard to find GOOD mexican food in this freakin town ugh."}
{"text":"Went in tonight and it was delicious. Ordered 5 tacos of Carne asada. Was hot, fresh, tender and delicious. One taco of Chile relleno, was delicious as well. Hot fries, and two pork tamales. Everything was delicious! Hot, fresh and flavorful. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"The tacos and the Windy City fries are awesome. My family really likes the chicken quesadillas as well. This place is has become our \"go too taco joint\"."}
{"text":"My fiancé is from CA and he's barely going on 2 years of living in Las Vegas. The biggest disappointment was not having a good taco place like the ones in CA. We've tried a few places and Chicago Style Taco Shop was stumbled upon by his boss. He took my dad step mom and me there tonight.. we tried the Tacos de asada, pastor, and pollo. And we had the nachos de asada. Everything was hot, fresh, and so good. The red salsa was spicy and it was the best. We definitely found our spot, took us almost 2 years but it's okay. My step mom is a hard food critic and even she liked it. What made our visit even more special was Joe came out of the back and asked us about our visit. We got to conversation with him for a little bit and it was a pleasure. We definitely will be bringing family and friends and spreading the word about this spot. Good job Chicago Style."}
{"text":"Fabulous neighborhood taco shop in our neck of the woods.  We came here when they first opened and I finally came back on Super Bowl Sunday at half time.  The 3 taco combo is a deal at $8.50.  For that inexpensive price, you can choose from asada, cecina, picadillo, barbacoa, pastor, carnitas, chorizo, or pollo.  I tried the cecina (thin salted steak) for the first time based on other Yelpers' reviews and it was excelente, as were the other tacos.  The combo also comes with rice, beans, and soda, so the price is certainly right and I got to watch Lady Gaga tear it up on the flat screens, too.  Give this small taco business a try and you'll see what Chicago style is all about."}
{"text":"Really cool guys, very helpful, good food. GOOD STUFF! NO MESSIN AROUND!!!!  We got a little of everything"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! It sucks how their shop is hard to find but I prefer it over Robertos and Tacos El Gordo."}
{"text":"Amazing food, closest I've had to SoCal Mexican food since I got here. The green sauce is bomb too. Kinda dingy looking inside but the staff is nice and it's clean."}
{"text":"This is the best taco spot in this area. I'm telling everyone about this place. Carne asada meat isn't dry like most places which is a plus!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They make my tacos exactly how you like them & the service is welcoming and professional. I confess the Windy City Fries are outstanding but the price of $12 for a large is a bit harsh given the surrounding competition. If they can find a way to make that a bit friendlier, you may just have yourself a 1Stop Taco shop!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We try to eat here every time we come to Las Vegas. The Windy Fries are the best. I tried the taco salad this time and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Oh my Lanta, this place is The bomb diggity! After having trouble deciding on what to order, the lady suggested the windy city fries. I ordered the carne asada. These fries come with THREE different cheeses, need I say more? Everything on their menu is delicious and the horchata is amazing with just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"Have been at this place twice and I have loved my tacos and carne asada fries. Without doubs, the Best taco place that I have tried on Las Vegas. Staff very friendly (which for me is a plus)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very friendly people work here! However, the food was not memorable for me here. I had a steak quesadilla and my bf had their tacos. It was okay, but nothing more. Maybe we just didn't order the right thing or idk what. Not a place I would crave to come back to!"}
{"text":"Joe was extremely helpful in choosing an item off the menu. I went with the windy fries which was loaded with carne asada.  It was really good. My wife got a burrito and that was delicious also. We also tried the horchata and it was bomb. We will definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"This place has authentic Mexican tacos and they're delicious! Definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Their Windy City Fries are delicious and they have great salsas to compliment the dish as well. It's never easy finding a good taco spot here in the Valley and this is now close to the top of my list.   In addition to the fantastic food, they have impeccable service by checking on you to make sure your food is satisfying and offer if they can assist you with anything else. Big plus!"}
{"text":"Wandered in to this little mom and pop shop for the firat time. I just moved into the neighborhood. So I ordered there Al pastor fries to go. Absolutely digging the flavor. The guy who greeted me was very nice and helpful. Definitely coming back to this gem. Five stars for sure"}
{"text":"Ehh nothing special. Not much taste to it. I wouln't come back. I ordered chorizo tacos. Tastes like a beef taquito. Ugh. Pretty disappointing. But the lady that took the order was nice."}
{"text":"Another go-to for authentic Mexican food with that mid-west flair. Don't pass this place up. Bomb. Shared a small carne asada fries and three tacos (al pastor, thin salted steak and barbacoa) with the girlfriens. Everything was delicious. Joe the chef even hooked me up with a sour cream + chipotle mix that I coined, \"Allan's sauce\" that I used to spread on the tacos."}
{"text":"We came here because of the five star reviews and it was even better than we expected. Joe, Liz, and the cook (sorry I forgot his name) were all extremely nice and helpful.  The food was fresh and hot. I  had the three tacos, all were tasty and moist. The refried beans were creamy and delicious.  My daughter had their home made horchata with her meal and loved it.  My wife enjoyed a chicken torta. She loved the flavor of the chicken.  To top things off, we split the Windy City fries which are a meal itself. Everything was excellent.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the fries! They were quite good, the portion was great. I wanted to like this place so bad given the reviews I was excited to check it out. Their tamarindo dispenser was broken.. ok next time right? They forgot my sisters order, by the time it came to her the rest of us were half way through our meal. This place needs serious ventilation improvement, it's foggy. When I walked out my clothes smelled like the grill. So all in all, the food is good. I think this place is better for take out more so than sit & eat there."}
{"text":"Saw all the good reviews on yelp and decided to try. Al pastor has no flavor. Chicago style fries are terrible. On top Of that got the food to go and ordered 4 grilled jalapeños and they forgot to pack it. I called and told the worker you charged me for them, it's cool they offered to give them free next time but unfortunately, there won't be a next time. I'll stick to tacos el gordos."}
