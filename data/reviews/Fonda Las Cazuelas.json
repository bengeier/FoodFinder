{"text":"We dined a few more times here and the food is still great. The molcajete is really a bargain and plenty of food for two even when split into a half order. Some tables are located near ceiling speakers and the music is lively so that might not be for everyone."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte Thursday's are $1 taco night!!!! Guacamole is fresh and very delicious! !!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Endless chips and salsa to begin. I got the asada burrito and it was amazing. The cheese is perfect and the steak is mmmmmmmmm!!! The tacos highlight the meat with a simple onion and cilantro topping, and boy is that meat good. The outside may look scary but the inside is very warm and inviting and the food is A+. Definitely an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We walked in and no one acknowledged us they kept walking by us like we were invisible. Customer services sucks!! Wast of time."}
{"text":"I feel as if this restaurant deserves two separate reviews; one for the food and one for the service. I'll start with the service. The waitresses aren't exactly\"friendly\". I came here today arouns 5pm with my grandmother and my wife. The waitresses saw us come in, but didn't greet us or even made an attempt to seat us even though there wasn't much of a waiting line. After I asked if we could get a table, and after we were sat, the lady asked us if we wanted \"charro beans\" or chips and salsa. We went with the chips and salsa and ordered cheese dip. To drink, we all had \"horchata\", which is basically a rice drink (it taste better than it sounds!). When we came to order, the lady asked us in a rather rude tone of voice, but my wife had \"tacos dorados\", my grandmother ordered \"los tres amigos\", and I ordered four \"tacos al pastor\". The food, as usual, took about 15 minutes to arrive. But when it did, it was absolutely amazing! Coming from a Hispanic background, I've tasted Mexican food before, but I have to say, this is by far one of the best tasting Americanized Mexican foods I've eaten! Having eating at Azteca and Zapata as well as other less mainstream places, this tops them. The food has a very different taste compared to other restaurants that serve the same dishes, but different in the best ways possible! I'm definitely coming back, but next time I'll take it to go!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitresses were downright rude. I don't know if it's because we're not Spanish speakers but seriously the service is pitiful. Food was good- but not good enough to deal with this. We will absolutely not be back."}
{"text":"Really good mexican restaurant. Their lunch and dinner specials are awesome (sometimes you have to ask for the specials menu).

Great food, awesome service, unbelievable prices, very family friendly. 

Additional tip: start out with the guacamole; it's as good as it gets. Also try the free bean soup they offer as an appetizer."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely wonderful.  I had a lunch special, fajitas that had chicken and chorizo.  Everything was delicious and at $6.25 was a fantastic price. That price included a soda.  I would recommend all of my friends to go here everytime they are in Charlotte.  I will be back.  Can't wait to visit this place again. :)  The customer service was great as well, smiling and polite and brought my food out quickly."}
{"text":"Yet another great place to eat mexican on N. Tryon.  Bargain prices on the lunch menu, prices ranging from $5.75 to $6.75 including softdrink. Really can't go wrong at these prices. As to be expected a basket of chips along with salsa is brought to you with your drinks. The chips here are the best I've had in Charlotte, light with a pronounced corn flavor, the salsa is flavorful as well. Sundays are busy here as a live Mariachi band is on hand. Overall a nice find, but how do I choose ? My fave in the area is El Taco Veloz, and we have frequented Taquiria Guadalajara as well, now we have to add a 3rd place to our list for good mexican. These 3 places on N. Tryon blow away the \"chain\" restaurants, there really is no comparison."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The service was dissapointing. Servers are not organized nor very friendly / welcoming."}
{"text":"If you know anyone that speaks Spanish, invite them to come with you. The staff maybe spoke a few words of conversational English..I'm certainly not complaining, just want to give others fair warning. Despite the language barrier, I would definitely return. The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially the lunch specials. The food is authentic, and comes out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My ass exploded after eating that chicken, but boy it was delicious, top of the line chicken bon apittete"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Mexican food. They have a great lunch special every day for $5.95 which includes chips and salsa plus a drink. Today we ordered the burrito loco and the chimichanga both with shredded chicken."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. The food is authentic and absolutely delicious! I love the tortilla chips!"}
{"text":"Very good food, fresh tasting and well executed. Service is friendly but you'll need to stay on top of your server to get your drinks refreshed and to ask for condiments, etc.
I had skirt steak, chicken enchiladas and carnitas tacos. All were first rate. My wife had shredded beef tacos and pupusas, which were both tasty and filling. Even my daughter's cheeseburger was good -- it was obviously grilled over a flame. Prices are VERY reasonable. The health rating is 94, comfortably in the \"A\" zone. Customers were almost all Hispanic, which speaks to the authenticity of the place. I definitely will go back and hope to have a similarly positive experience next time."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, fresh food in an attractive place with great service. Handmade tortillas, smoky salsas... Just great. The beans they bring out at the beginning are also tasty - don't pass them up.  This is more a taquer√≠a with better decor than the typical NC tex-mex place. 

Beer list includes some fantastic imports ( e. g. Victoria) that most Mexican places don't have. Don't miss their horchata, either."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
The food here was very, very good. The service was abysmal. It was my daughter in law's bday, and he is of Mexican descent, so we all, with my 3 year old, grandchild, decided on Mexican. Our first attempt was Cabo Fish Tavos, but we left home way too late, and the wait was more than an hour and a half, so that wasn't, happening. My saw saw the reviews for this restaurant, so off we went.. We were seated fairly quickly, not a small feat for 7 hungry people, plus a toddle. About 45 minutes after being seated, no drinks,  no chips, our waitress came out to  tell us that they were slammed, and our food would take about 10-15 minutes longer.  We all worked in the food industry, so we were okay with that. About a half hour after that, our Dinka and chips apoeared., so we were patient. About 30- 40 minutes after that, our waitress reappeared to tell us that our food would be running 10- 15 minutes late.  We left, a hungry 3 year old, and the rest. We were going to pay for our drinks, and the chips, but in all fairness, they comped them. The salsa was so outstanding that my son wantedtomreturn the next day for lunch. Which was stellar, both food and service. So, how do you rate this? Would I ever return? Sure..,at lunch, never again at dinner. 

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Out of control deeeeelicious!!!! This Mexican food Is more authentic than Mexican food in Arizona! Hahahaha seriously though... The mariachi was amazing, great service! Can't say enough!"}
{"text":"When we are starving, for some reason we always tend to want Mexican food...so there we were!

Based on previous reviews we decided to try this place. I would say this place has authentic Mexican food. Why? Because we had to dig deep for our Spanish because they weren't really trying to speak English, and you know what...we weren't even mad. I love being on someone else's territory and having to step up to the plate. 

The service and food were both very good. Of course we ordered Horchata because we love it so much and theirs was very good. I had the fajita quesadillas and he, the dinner fajitas. Both were seasoned well and just plain yummy! 

We really enjoyed our time here. We shall return! :)"}
{"text":"If a successful commerce encounter is one where the business fills a need for the customer, then I must say that my lunch as Fonda las Cazuelas was indeed successful. (The need being a decent, relatively clean, Mexican place near my office.)

They offer a lunch special at the cant-be-beat price of $5.75 for your choice 12-14 entrees (all of which include the standard rice and refried beans) and a (soft) drink. I went for the Enchiladas Verdes with chicken. The food arrived so quickly that I was suspicious it would taste exactly like it came out of a can, but the chicken was well seasoned and the sauce had the tiniest bit of kick. The rice was about average, not crunchy but nothing special. The beans were slightly less reminicent of cat food than many places I've tried, and when mixed with some of the stray cheese crumbles they were downright tasty.

The server was cheerful and attentive, but that may have been because there were only about 4 tables occupied in the entire place. On my lunch hour I was able to comfortably run a 20 minute errand, eat at a comfortable pace and get back to work with 10 or 15 minutes to spare. 

It's safe to say that I'll be lunching at the Fonda again."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was ok, but the band was HORRIBLE! 

They came by our table and started singing which we thought was cute. They ended up staying by our table and although we thought it was a little weird we thought they were being romantic. 

After 6-7 songs we stopped them. Once we stopped them they charged us $120!!! We thought it was a joke but they were serious. They said that they charge for each song. We never once requested a song and we never once were told that they charge. We were so upset and they would not let us go. Finally we have them what we had which was about $80. However we will never ever be back here. 

I'm pretty sure they were doing the same thing to other tables. I mean what type of restaurant would allow such a thing? Needless to say that because of this i would not return."}
{"text":"So. Good.
The place is kinda sketchy but the food is amazing.
Seems very Authentic and just absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've been so disappointed by the past few Mexican restaurants I was starting to feel like maybe my tastes had changed.  Well y tastes hadn't changed, i was just eating a lot of crappy Mexican until I found this place.  
My car dealer is down the road and I didn't want to wait there for service and then I found this place while walking by.  

The chips are perfect.  Crispy, but still a bit of firmness to scoop up salsa.  The salsa has cilantro which I love.  If you think cilantro tastes like soap (it's genetic) I have no time for you.

i ordered the mole poblano (chicken mole).  The chicken fresh, not like it had been cooked hours ago and dipped in mole at the last minute.  

The decor is clean and bright.  

I wouldn't even say I liked it because they Americanized it.  I think it's pretty authentic since I'm the only one in here who speaks English as a first language

This place is great!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for more than what the usual Mexican chain restaurant has to offer, then N. Tryon is loaded with some fine choices. Fonda las Cazuelas is one of the better ones. Some of what they do is the best on the Tryon strip; some aspects are lacking.  Here's the breakdown.

Best Chips on Tryon. I always say I'm going to order soup instead of the chips, but damn these chips are evil & I can't resist their temptation. Light, crispy, always hot with just the right amount of salt. They don't last long...

Salsa's are ok; not as good as some of the other places but still much better than what you will get at a chain.

Love the taco's here; the meat is great. I usually get the steak asada, barbacoa, and the pork skin. Each item is cooked perfectly; great char on the asada, the barbacoa is slow cooked & tender, and the pork skin has a nice soft texture to contrast with the other taco's. The down side is that they are served rather plainly with a minimum of onion & cilantro. Sometimes I don't mind the meat pure and unadulterated, but really enjoy adding toppings that they don't have here.

Another minor downside is the presentation of the taco's. They are delivered to the table wrapped in foil; two taco's in each foil packet. Then they are placed in a basket. A little more pizazz in the arrangement would be nice, but I don't find it a deal breaker.

Not everything is served in baskets; all of the other items are served on huge platters with the usual beans & rice. Portions are large enough to feed a couple of hungry great danes, prices are ridiculously cheap, check it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I dined here with a few friends one evening during the week. There weren't too many people dining. Between my friends and I, all of our food was really tasty and filling! The prices are great and what they should be. The service could have been just a tad better, the waitress was absent most of our time there. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this place and I'll be back some day soon!"}
{"text":"This was a great find. I eat a LOT of tortilla chips, and theirs (free) were some of the best I've ever had. Hot, crispy, and strong enough to hold a hearty amount of salsa (also free), guacamole, and taco fillings. Speaking of tacos, I had the tacos barbacoa, pastor, and alambre. I'd never had the last one, and all were delicious. Most tacos are $1.85 each, and I probably could have been satisfied with just two (in addition to the chips and guac). I usually eat a lot, so that's saying something. I ended with sopapillas drizzled with strawberry syrup, which were also excellent, although I don't have a lot to compare them to.

My beer was served with a frosted mug, which was a nice touch.

Don't be put off by the huge sign in the front window warning that nobody is allowed in wearing masks or hoodies!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a different place 
Couldn't find and that place had (5)star's?
So we see this place and Lot's of ppl coming and going.
So we said what the hell we went in and it was great!
We are from Cali and the food was so good.
The waitress was great"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from southern California, so we need our Mexican food fix on a regular basis. Fonda is very authentic, not to mention extremely tasty. I had the 3 gorditas with lengua, al pastor and barbacoa, i also ordered an asada taco on the side (this was my test, the taco tells all when it comes to authenticity). The asada was fantastic and their tortillas are made fresh and taste delicious. the way they cook and season their meats is fantastic and can rival any taco truck in Los Angeles. My wife had the enchiladas rancheras which also delivered with really great taste and seasoning. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great gyros just needs a lil more meat but great taste . Chicken also good. Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"This was my third - and likely last - visit to La Cazuelas. Previous visits were unremarkable, while this one miserably failed.

The hostess seemed disappointed that we intended to eat in. The place was pretty full and the hour not late - not sure what that was about. Our server appeared to be seriously inconvenienced by my query regarding the availability of a fish taco (not on the menu - but hey, I'm just askin').

This is a place where I have observed most of the clientele are offered the option of soup as their complimentary appetizer, but I have never been offered anything but the standard chips and salsa.

We ordered the vegetarian burrito. It was stuffed with a strange assortment of vegetables, the likes of which I've never seen in a Mexican place. Cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, broccoli - wait, I recognize this combination! Good ol' frozen mixed vegetables. Yep, they even tasted a little bit freezer-burnt. They also had no additional seasoning that I could discern. The rice and beans were missing from the dinner, but by the time the server checked back with us we just wanted to finish up and head out, so we didn't ask them to correct that oversight.

The good: the chips were fresh and hot, and the salsa was tasty. For this reason, La Cazuelas earns an extra star from this reviewer."}
{"text":"My partner is Mexican and I lived there for quite some time.  We were craving authentic home-cooked food and an authentic atmosphere; we stumbled upon it and loved every bite.  We have found our new favorite home-cooked Mexican and we've gone back several times since discovering it.  The service team is great!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Great service. pretty empty every time we've been but that almost makes it feel more special."}
{"text":"Stopped in this week for a business lunch. I ordered the taco + burrito. It was amazing. Really tasty! The way they season the meat I think (I got steak), is really really good. Not overly sauced or drowning in cheese. Food came quickly and our waitress was really sweet and efficient. She noticed I did not eat my Spanish rice and recommended I try the white rice next time -- as it was really good too. (I'm just not a big fan of rice, but it was nice to get the recommendation.) I will definitely be going back. Ambiance, convenience, speed, service and especially the taste and presentation of the food. Thumbs up. Very reasonable in cost. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'd been in Charlotte for over a week, and hadn't had the chance to try any non-chain restaurants until Sunday night.  Fonda las Cazuelas is delicious!  I had a seafood dish called the 2 Devils (I think), and it was so fantastic.  I'm still thinking about the sauce the large shrimp and white fish were cooked in, a little spicy, very savory and so yummy.  The guac was super good, too...really fresh and handmade.  A couple fo Dos Equis, a couple shots of tequila, and great service...I'm hooked, Fonda las Cazuelas!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any more authentic than this. The best mexican restaurant in Charlotte period. Great service and more than great food. The torta cubana was the best thing I've ever tasted. Fresh ingredients, it doesn't get better than this. It's also super affordable too."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food that has traditional dishes. I recommend drinking aguas frescas and eating taquitos dorados. Chip salsa could be better."}
{"text":"This unassuming place is the real thing. Wide choice of authentic dishes expertly cooked. The staff is nice and helpful. Live music on the weekend. Mostly local patrons. This is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is one of my top three Mexican restaurants in all of Charlotte. Everything taste authentic. The salsa taste incredible! I swear I think they make it by hand in the back. They offer all different types of meat. Just an excellent place to eat. Plus, a lunch menu for $5.75! I can usually have an entree, appetizer and drink (non alcohol) for under $12! The staff is incredibly friendly too! Try it!! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, funny as I type that, I remind myself; it's the only Mexican or Latin restaurant I really like but that is probably because I ALWAYS order the Enchiladas Rancheras. They are quite yummy made with real corn tortilla, the way they are supposed to be made, not 100% authentic but but by golly it's close enough to keep me coming back. I adore the fact that the Traditional Corn Tortilla's are actually Hand Made!!! A Rarity! Believe me I know. Oh now though, the rice could be a lot better, also please work on your Aguas Frescas or Fresh Made Water, less sugar, more of a balanced  water to fruit ratio because my Agua Fresca was way more watery than nummy. Kitty out."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a quest to find the best Mexican food in Charlotte. We try everything. This place is our new favorite. We like dine in and take out. Friendly staff and delicious food. Salsa provided is good with cilantro and onion in it. Salsa verde is available upon request and is delicious. Hubby almost always gets a burrito or chimichanga and loves it. I usually try to get something different each time...tonight I had the sopes. I asked for steak. They were great. I've also had the gorditas and carnitas. But...if you are looking for a great steak taco...try this place. Steak is seasoned well and tortillas are homemade...cilantro and onion and lime on the side. Delish! Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"I dined here previously months ago because it was so highly rated on Yelp. I walked feeling okay about it. Not the best but not the worst either. Would I come again was the question but some reason we ended up visiting again many months later.

On my most recent visit, we sat down and while the waitress didn't speak much English and was depending on me speaking Spanish (No habla espanol), it was fine. She ended up bringing another waitress over later on to assist with ensuring our order was correct. This was nice. 

We sat down and received our chips and salsa. Our chips were stale if that is possible. It was like they refried the chips to make them warm but something about them was off. We asked for another basket thinking it was just a bad batch but it wasn't. The salsa however was good. 

We ordered rolled tacos off the appetizer menu. They came out gorgeous and were actually quite good. The green sauce will make them soggy quite quick - so you have to eat them fast. 

I ordered carnitas because it seems that is my go to most Mexican places. It was seasoned well and the rice and beans it came with was standard fare that you will find at all other places. 

My hunny ordered a chorizo burrito and it was just okay. Nothing great but not bad. 

They are a solid 3.5 stars. I just have other places I rather dine at for better food when it comes to Mexican or Hispanic food."}
