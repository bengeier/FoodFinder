{"text":"Best place to eat in the mall hands down.  This is a \"meat and two sides\" sort of place.  Food was great and the people were nice.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I expected more and better. The fried chicken was fair the brussels sprouts and black add peas tasted like they had been cooked in hot water with some salt. I believe the black add peas were straight out of the can and he did up. The peach cobbler was very Doughy and the crust was not very crisp. I cannot recommend this place. The server was very nice"}
{"text":"Stop in there today for lunch was greeted and given a sample which was very good. I ended up with chicken tenders which were awesome. And all the other food they had looked great too. For great food and very friendly service I suggest you give them a try."}
{"text":"Great helpful staff with delicious food. The best part is even though it's southern soul food the veggies contain no meat. The veggies are mildly seasoned which is good especially since you can always add salt. My son said his fried chicken was perfectly seasoned and I could tell it had a nice crunch. Would definitely recommend it if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice now and have fallen in love with it. The service is friendly, the food selection is large and southern! Amazing creamy - cheesy Mac-N-Cheese. They know have to maintain their food staging counter so that nothing sits too long and is always hot and fresh. Breakfast, lunch, snack boxes, desserts and much more. The Eastridge Mall food court is always kept clean and tidy. Access is easy and fast with excellent parking, then in the door, up the escalator and your there. So if you want to dash in for a lunch box and get back out it's perfect for this or linger in the open court dining area. So far I've had the white fish with a thin crispy coating and thick large moist fillet. I'm going to try to post their menu board so you can see their great choice selection! You can get to go dinners also, box of Chicken with sides! Take it home after a busy day! They do have a facebook page."}
{"text":"This is such a great place!! We travel from kings mountain to just eat here. Honestly it's pretty much the only reason we even go to that mall any more! The man who is always at the front is a great entrepreneur and I can't wait to see them own there own restaurant! They're all great honest people and very polite! Great prices for great food!"}
{"text":"Holy moly what a find. This is in a mall but you wouldn't know it from the taste of things. These two guys know how to make good southern food. Best chicken I ever had and the sides were amazing!! Get the black eyed peas and corn, you won't regret it. I'm not usually a fired chicken fan but this was phenomenal. Give them a try. If I lived in town this guy's would make serious money off of me. Good thing I'm flying out today or I would need a second mortgage on my house to finance my eating habits here."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are amazing. The men at the counter are so helpful and polite and friendly. Highly recommend this spot over any of the other  Southern home-style cooking restaurants. Beats Cracker Barrel hands-down. If I lived here, this spot would be my go-to."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat at the mall but it looked good when we walked by! Service was very kind and informative and food was terrific! Fried chicken and tenders were great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Chicken tenders are to die for here. The flavor and the juiciness in these tenders make them the best around town. The big name competition really has nothing on them. Sides are great here as well. The employees, including the owner, have excellent customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In love. This place is all around the definition of southern food. The selections of meat & sides vary. There's different combos you can do. I'm very picky when it comes to vegetables & with chicken tenders. Most chicken tenders have too much bread & hardly any meat. Theirs have more of a crispy crust & it's very meaty. The chicken is juicy & flavorful. On top of the great food the staff is so friendly & they genuinely appreciate when they recognize you coming back for more."}
{"text":"To die for! I'm never disappointed. The food is true soul food. It reminds me of everything delicious growing up in the south.  I go to the mall just to eat here. The employees are awesome. The sweet tea is amazing. You won't be let down. I recommend the chicken and greens. Of course the mac and cheese is delicious too. And the broccoli casserole, oh my goodness!!"}
{"text":"Southern food is good if eaten in moderation, but this place will make you cheat a little .. best fish and chicken ever .Staff is Awesome as well as the owner Jeff who is the best .. thumbs up"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! Great food and the owner is so nice and hygiene is amazing they wash their hands constantly!! I love the food and the conversation!! Your not forgotten they may not know your name but they won't forget your face!! Just what you need when you think of comfort food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat excellent customer service excellent food and they allow you to taste a example good O Southern food I waited a while for my fresh fish to be fried it was fried fresh because I waited too long my whole meal was free talk about good customer service if I'm ever in this area I will definitely come back.  Thank you and God bless"}
{"text":"This place does not taste like the normal \"mall food\" they could defiantly be their own stand alone  restaurant. The people who work here are so friendly and they will let you sample whatever you want before you buy. Very good! Love this place. They have lots of fresh vegetables. Even my 4 year old will eat chicken from here and he is the pickest eater i know!"}
{"text":"I had excellent southern staples with gracious gentlemen serving up the food. They're located in the food court of the Eastridge Mall; it is an easy in, easy out spot. Vegetables are cooked without meat seasoning, which could be a bonus for some and a strike for others, but they were still excellent."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for their service, I would give their food 4 stars. Everyone that works there is exceptionally friendly and very helpful. They really seem to care about their customers and that's a rare find these days. The food is good, not great but good. Given the large scale/buffet way that it's cooked it is better than I had expected. I would definitely eat here again."}
