{"text":"Amazing food. As a white guy born and raised in Arizona I'm not the best judge of authenticity, but I know Mexican food and this place is amazing. Good service but it is not fast food, so be patient. The menu is all in spanish but the bilingual cashier/waitress speaks perfect English"}
{"text":"Worst food and service ever. I do not recommend this place at all. The menudo was smelly didn't have enough meat with a bunch of hominy. We walked in an nobody greeted us or told us you had to order at the counter. After waiting for someone to come we finally figured it out. You think someone could have said something. But no, no hi no bye no thank you nothing. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food.  We are from out of town and were pleasantly surprised to find authentic tacos and mexican food here in Mesa.  We would definitely come back.  The tacos were a little higher priced around 2.50/taco but they have a happy hour some days when certain tacos are 99 cents. The horchata was delicious and just the right sweetness."}
