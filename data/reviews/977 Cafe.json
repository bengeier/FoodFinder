{"text":"I ordered online through justeat.ca The food was decent. The egg rolls were overcooked, the rice was a little oily and needed more flavour. The fried chicken wings and beef with mixed vegetables was pretty good. The general tso chicken was more sweet than spicy. I would have preferred more spicy. All in all it was decent."}
{"text":"I am the first person to review this place so you must listen to me.   This review is for their delivery service.  Big serving sizes, they don't skimp on ingredients, fast delivery, good quality, but a little bland. They make a nice Cantonese Chow Mein.  It's not good enough for me to put more thought into this, or make a wordplay joke like 'it was 977th Heaven,' but I would order again."}
{"text":"I am visiting from the states and decided to stop here for food with my fianc√©. We received the worst customer service. They didn't come to the counter to take our order until we asked their unattended children in the dining area if anyone was there to help us and the little girl. They charged my card for our order and then told us they wouldn't make us the food because it was an American card and they don't like American cards and refused to give me a refund. I had been using my American card here all week long with no issues. They had the audacity to ask me to write down my card number for them so they could issue the refund later. After 20 minutes of arguing with them, and the husband and wife berating each other in Chinese they finally remembered how to give a refund. If I could give this restaurant less stars than one I would, and I didn't even get to try to food. My advice would be to eat literally anywhere else besides here."}
{"text":"Little westernized Chinese food take out place that serves the typical westernized Chinese food (sweet and sour chicken balls, egg rolls, chop suey etc.). Had the C1 combo and house flat noodles and to my surprise they were decent. A bit on the greasy side as even the container was dripping with oil. Definitely a take out place as the inside is pretty gross. Reminiscent to old school Chinatown conditions."}
{"text":"Absolute worse customer service. I called and the person who answered the phone did noy speak english. They have a live chat, but I wanted to speak to someone in person. They provided me with a 1-877 number which was not in service. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions and was not comfortable giving my Visa. What happened to live customer service?"}
