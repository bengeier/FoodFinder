{"text":"The best pizza i have ever had!  Delivery is very fast, and the pizza is just great quality. I got it for my birthday and it was amazing! It was a good thing we got large cause the whole family attacked it cause it was so good! So bottom line... tasty, and fast."}
{"text":"I have turned back and decided to give these small place a better chance.  I have order from here a couple of times by now. To be honest this is not the best pizza I have tried. But I can see that they are trying hard to bring quality products. There only big flow is to think as a small business. Because they want to save some money they are not fully staffed all the time and this brings service problems. For example they only deliver in weekends!! If you are a pizza place you have to close late and deliver every day! Other thing is that if they don't see customers they'll close early and go home. Please remember the small business actions will not allow you to grow and give a better service!"}
{"text":"So my parents had the pizza delivered at Whirleyball and they came home raving about the sheet pizza that it was fabulous like unbelievable and we had to order it on the weekend. They said it was so worth it we drove 20 min there and 20 min back for it. Its a hole in the wall carry out pizza joint at the end of a shopping plaza. 

Unfortunately on our second experience we ordered just a large pizza. The regular pizza wasn't as great. It was slightly under cooked and not filled very far to the edges of the crust. My stepdad was pretty bummed  because the sauce that he loved so much the first night was barely on the pizza. In my opinion it kind of tasted similar to a corner store or bowling alley pizza...don't hate me people. I mean like, really thick with dough and little toppings with little to no flavor just warm pizza. I didn't even finish my piece because it wasn't worth cheating on my diet. 

Other notes were that I called 3 different times and it rang continuously and I hung up all 3 times with no success getting someone on the line. We were calling back again to add more to the order but never got through to do so. When arriving I can see why we didn't get through though. There was only one man working his BUTT off. Even when my moms credit card was waiting to process he walked over and did something else during that 10 seconds. Not the cleanest place as a lot of activity without gloves or washing hands but that doesn't always bother me much at a pizza joint. 

Bottom line is I did not like the pizza really at all with what else is out there. However, my parents know pizza. They are obsessed with pizza and if they said the sheet pizza was good I'm sure it was banging! So I will not write this place off yet, I will have to try some sheet pizza here someday!"}
{"text":"This mom and pop has been around for about 30 years. It's really set up for carry out and that's about it. They make decent pizza and are around the corner from me so I'll be back. Additional tries off the menu will determine if I would recommend anyone go a little out of their way for a stop here."}
{"text":"This place is low key, but the pizza is really good. I've lived in the area for almost 2 years, and finally tried the pizza a few months ago. Better than the same old chains in the Solon area and its reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We live less than a mile from here and drive by daily. Finally decided to try the pizza from this little hole in the wall. I am happy to report that we will return. The crust was perfectly crunchy without being too hard or too chewy.  We got the \"white gourmet\" but had red sauce instead.  Was ready in 20 which in my opinion is very reasonable."}
