{"text":"Ive gotten the fries w/sauce and the fish sandwich. Both were delicious. I don't know how they make that sauce, but its excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food....hot off the stove fresh. You wouldnt know it from the outside, but this is a great spot to eat. I got the perch with mac n cheese and fries as my sides. Dined in so I can experience it all. Waitress was very nice and thats always an added bonus when visiting a place for the 1st time. Food was delicious. My food came out in about 30 mins, but to me that meant they prepared everything from scratch, plus I waited in Giordano's in Chicago for an hour so Im not complaining at all. Whatever you do, make sure you get the special Cherry O sauce. You wont be disappointed at all.....best BBQ sauce Ive ever had. Sunday buffet at Cherry-O is pretty popular as well. We even has a good chat with the owner who was super cool."}
{"text":"Needs a little more work to the building and with food selection but everything was good. I would recommend for the price.."}
