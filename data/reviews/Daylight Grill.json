{"text":"Visited Daylight Grill today for brunch. Everything starting from the welcome, seating us, food choices to our food itself was great! The atmosphere is great for families and friendly. Loved it. Had the steak benedict, salmon benedict, kids scrambled eggs and the big fat greek omelette. All were yummy - even their texas toast is yummy (usually dry and uneatable at other breakfast places). Coffee and tea was great. Most of all the service is so friendly. The owner is the nicest person you have ever met. My kids loved her and the way she helped them choose! Would give them more than 5 stars if I could :) Perfect weekend spot!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience last time.  This time round,  was a bit disappointed.  Sadly they can't accommodate dietary restrictions or any form of substitutions. The service this round wasn't great at all."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place. French toast and waffles were delicious. The service outstanding. The only thing which I didn't like was they charge $2.49 for maple syrup which is given in a small plastic container."}
{"text":"Our favourite spot to eat on a Sunday morning.  You go here for the food and fair fare!  All the staff are friendly and attentive.  My wife and I usually have either the big breakfast or the eggs Benny.  Which are delicious.  It's often hard to decide what to get.  I actually have no complaints.  Waffles, eggs, hash browns, French toast, pancakes, bacon.... Mmmmmmm. Moooooore!  
See you next week!"}
{"text":"Bright, friendly, affordable, free wifi, accepts credit card, and their Daylight Grill Breakfast was so large, it was served to me on three plates!!!"}
{"text":"The world needs more breakfast places like this.  Fast, tasty and great value for your money. What more do you need?  Location? Right by the go station, in a plaza with a ton of parking. Did I mention the serice is fast?  It's also friendly, a combo often unseen.

I had an omelette. Huge (5 eggs??!!?) and yummy. My friend had a regular breakfast and it was also great. Breakfast is supposed to be simple and it shouldn't bankrupt you. Thankfully the owners of the Daylight Grill get that."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. Lots and lots of options and ways to customize your breakfast. There is always a steady stream of people coming and going, there appears to be lots of regulars (always a good sign).

Wait staff is attentive and always topping up your coffee.

Solid place for solid food. Definitely a good choice for a breakfast spot in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!  Affordable feast of eggs, potatoes, bacon & toast! Yum.  The eggs Benedict choices were many and the fast and friendly service spot on. I will certainly return if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So this was our second choice for the day because #1 was too long of wait. Very glad we ended up here. Food came out fast and was delicious. Coffee cup never went empty! Service all friendly and clean bathrooms too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Busy place on a Saturday afternoon.  

We ordered the three cheese and the spinach cheddar omelette which come with homestyle  potatoes and toast.  Nice light fluffy omelette with a generous portion of cheeses and spinach.

Friendly service and good coffee.  Worth a repeat visit for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is so noisy and the food is gross. You can see your food being cooked. Which is gross seeing how you just saw all the chefs smoking. Also is is very hot"}
{"text":"Fast and pleasant service, great prices, and Montreal smoked meat. It's is one of the two best breakfast places in Clarkson (the other is Macy's). We bring our toddler here and are always welcomed, even at rush hour on Sunday. And the food arrives so fast it's like we had called in advance. I guess that is why there is never a lineup even though it is often pretty busy. Very standard diner breakfast, with pancakes and hollandaise sauce that probably comes from a powder, and unremarkable hashbrowns but the eggs are always cooked as we ordered and the price is great for the portion size."}
{"text":"I had the grand slam breakfast. It was really good. My overeasy eggs were perfectly cooked. The pancakes were a bit on the rubbery side but you get lots of syrup. The service was fast, attentive, and pleasant. I would come back."}
{"text":"Such a great place forgot no-nonsense, basic, all day breakfast. Love coming here with my girlfriends for a nice weekend brunch.

The Grand Slam breakfast is SUPER filling and I always go home with leftovers. 

I love that this breakfast place allows you to do 50/50 bacon and sausage (some breakfast places won't let you do this). The servers are a little brisk whenever I go (it's usually the same servers) but they are fast and get the job done! Coffee and water is always refilled which is nice. 

I've never tried anything else on the menu but I do intend on trying the smoked salmon item next time."}
{"text":"I've just recently moved to the Clarkson area and have been to two different breakfast joints.  I have to say that overall Daylight Grill was the better of the two.  It wasn't that the other place was bad, it just wasn't quite as good.

The menu here is typical breakfast fare with prices that can't be beat.  They get a star from me alone because I believe (not certain) that my bacon was actually cooked as I ordered as opposed to sitting in a greasy pile for 45 minutes to keep up with all the orders coming in.  Also, you could recognize it as bacon as opposed to something that resembled the tail on Piglet from Winnie the Pooh.

They don't skimp on the Texas Toast but I would've liked a second packet of jam... yes I know, First World problem.  The service was prompt and I had a coffee on my table within about 60 seconds of sitting down.  Judging also by their lists of sandwiches, this would also be a great place to come for an unassuming lunch.  

All in all, this is solid earthy breakfast fare and I'm looking forward to swinging back again in the near future.

Enjoy all!"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast food ..I mean it's hard to screw up eggs ....The prices are decent .I'd recommend it , But if you have a Hangover or want a quiet morning maybe go elsewhere ..it's noisy in there"}
{"text":"Love Daylight Grill and the friendly service.  It really is one of the best all day breakfast places to go in the area.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place due to a delayed doctors appointment nearby. What a great find. Clean, great service, real home made food, nice strong coffee, and a great price! Homefries were the best i have ever tasted, fresh, not greasy with just enough seasoning. This place does everything right!,"}
{"text":"The best tip I can give for breakfast is that if you're going in after 11:00am and want some peameal bacon, ask if its \"fresh\" first. We've all seen the mounds of bacon, homefrries and toast that are pre-made at many breakfast places. I guess many of them need to do that to seat as many peoplke as possible in a short time frame.

But if you're going in later to have breakfast, you might get hit with the bottom-of-the-pile rubbery, dry, bacon. So when I get there late I ask \"is the peameal bacon fresh\"? At least my complaint would be legitimate if it isn't \"fresh\".

Daylight Grill consistently exceeds my expectations. Portions are big enough to share and usually freshly made. Their Big Breakfast for $9.98 is more than enough for 2 people with 3 eggs, bacon sausage, home fries and pancakes.

The service is friendly and its always packed on weekends. I was in there today at noon and discovered a great menu for a \"breakfast grill\" and its not crowded."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast spot in clarkson. Super fast, yummy, inexpensive food and a friendly atmosphere. I've been coming here since it's opened."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and will continue to. Portions sizes are huge - great value for money.  Wait staff are fast (place is always packed but they make time to ensure you feel welcome). Favourites are the omlets and eggs Bennie. Husband loves the breakfast special (eggs, pancakes, 3 kinds of meat, etc). You will never leave their hungry!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but I was there last week and the lady paid us no attention didn't come back to our table to check up on us, didn't come back to check up if we needed anything. We usually sit in the corner table - the server for that table is THE BEST but that table was taken so very poor service didn't even feel bad not leaving a tip which I would normally feel terrible with."}
{"text":"Great food for the price and very good service.   The omelette is HUGE!   Can easily feed two people.  Very friendly staff they took the time to interact with our 4 year old."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, could you repeat that? $3.99 for three (3) eggs any style, my choice of bacon, ham, or sausages, toast, and a pile of delicious home fries? Every morning between 6:00am and 10:00am? And did you say something about bottomless coffee? What's the catch? 

Oh, you're located a 33 minute train ride away, across from Clarkson GO Station. You win this round, Daylight Grill. But I'll be back.

Obligatory Title Pun: If ever I thy face by DAYLIGHT see/Then scrambled, wheat whol'd, and sausage for thee!

Menu Readability: I don't even look at it, but it's what you expect for a diner.

Need to mention: With the morning commuter in mind, this place is FAST. I was halfway done eating 11 minutes after sitting down.

What this place teaches me about myself: I should get a job writing annoying radio ads."}
