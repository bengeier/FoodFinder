{"text":"Had dinner for the first time here last night, phenomenal experience! We sat in the bar to take advantage of happy hour but did take our first drinks outside to enjoy the view which is incredible.  I had a grapefruit cosmo and my boyfriend had a cucumber moscow mule both of which were awesome, I usually mix up my drinks when I go out but the grapefruit cosmo was so good I just had three of them.  We started with the edamame, then I had the short rib sliders and my boyfriend had a green chile burger, all three were sooooo good. Bryan took care of us at the bar and even came outside to check on us, also makes GREAT drinks, he was amazing! my parents live in the Las sendas community and I can't believe I haven't been here before, I will definitely be bringing them here for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I have given this place several chances thinking maybe the service will get better, it has only gotten worse. They won't let you sit on the patio if you are only having drinks and appetizers, so we go to order a meal, and they are OUT of TWO items we wanted!! Unbelievable! Another time we made reservations for first available which was 7:30, but we went early to see if we could get in, they said no we had to wait until 7:30 and then proceeded to seat walk-ins with a 15 minute wait, one after another! It was VERY RUDE! Never will I go back, never."}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner with my elderly father on a Thursday night after a long flight in from the northeast. It was very dark and once I discerned the entrance we were greeted and taken to a table at the railing overlooking the valley. The server, whose name I am not going to guess at was great - quick with the orders and very unobtrusive otherwise. A lone guitarist was serenading the 1/2 filled patio with holiday music. Even though it was late - about 8:00 the Prime Rib Special was still available and kudos to the Chef for delivering one of the best medium rare prime ribs at that late time! The potatoes and beans were likewise excellent - not overcooked. We did not have any room for sweets after - but we did sample the house red wine and it was full bodied and well worth the very reasonable, discounted price. Next time I am in town we will be back"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.. We went there for valentines day and my BFF birthday .. Food was cold, and serving people has no idea... They need a new management ....Went there twice will never go again !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambience was wonderful. The food and service really was pathetic. It took over 20 minutes just for our salads. My mother ordered a filet mignon and it was so dry I was shocked!  If you want a steak apparently you need to go to a real steak house. I ordered the salmon dish and it wasn't too bad, however it was dry as well,  which tells me that the person cooking doesn't have a clue how to prepare a great dish. Very sad if you ask me. I would not recommend this place for food. A cocktail yes."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their board is awesome. Also tried the salmon sandwich and the quest. Everything was good. A little hidden gem. Love going here."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We were part of a party of nine. Each couple ordered one or two appetizers. We were there over an hour and two appetizers each were delivers and the other four appetizers were never delivered to the table. I wish I could review the food, but we cancelled our appetizer after an hour and left. We'll never return."}
{"text":"A beautiful patio setting for a relaxing  dining experience.  The food was quite good with a wide variety of choose from.  The service; on the other hand, was less than satisfactory.  Our server had a pleasant personality but just was not up to the task at hand.  Perhaps another career path should be explored.  Very slow service, cold coffee brought to the table after a ten minute wait.  When I asked for hot coffee, I waited another 15 minutes only to have the server come back to tell me the coffee would be ready in about 10 minutes.  I cancelled the coffee and requested our check.  The check came and the charge for the coffee was still there.   Would probably go back, more for the view definitely, than the service.  Fairly high prices that should have commanded much better service."}
{"text":"Food and price are excellent, can service be slow, sure but you come here to enjoy the most amazing view in the valley! I have never had a bad meal here. Check it out it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great view and food. Service is excellent. Hannah is a great hostess. Happy hour is a bargain. We took our guests to happy hour this week and it was better than ever."}
{"text":"We live in the community and decided to go to the patio for the first time yesterday for our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival we discovered that no one was attentive to us. We didn't know if we seat ourselves or what since we made reservations. Finally we went to the bar guy and asked what do we do. He explained we can sit inside or outside. We said...ok. so we sat outside. The views and the live music were sensational. The only thing is...when we booked through opentable we were under impression we were getting the formal menu options such as the short rib and ravioli. But, instead we were handed a very informal Grille menu about 20 minutes after seating ourselves. The server gal was so sweet to us and we probably wouldn't of stayed if it wasn't for the views and the music. The girl blessed us with free dessert for our anniversary so she was thoughtful to us. I just really want to explain that this is much more of a bar vibe then formal dinning. We may go back for the simple fact that its in our community. We ordered the coconut shrimp and the french dip."}
{"text":"Our party of four arrived for a 6pm reservation on Friday night. We ordered promptly and sipped our drinks, catching up with each other.  After 90 minutes the hostess appeared to tell us the kitchen had \"had an issue\" with our order and it would be out in 5-7 minutes. She offered us a free glass of wine, which we accepted. The food eventually showed up 30 minutes later, a full 2 hours after we had arrived. It was very good. Our server finally admitted he had lost our order.  I feel they should have offered us more than just a free glass of wine after waiting that long."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a Friday night: great view, delicious food and awesome live entertainment!  The Green Chili Burger and fish tacos were amazing.  On Friday night's John Burak is the musician and does a great job!  The only challenge we had was food allergies (I can't eat gluten or soy), the first time we went the waiter didn't know for sure and just assumed.  However the second time the waiter asked the chef and was very helpful.  I had a pretty good reaction the first time and none the second (I ordered the delicious fish tacos the second time).  So if you go with food allergies make sure they talk to the chef.  And its pretty busy in the winter time so if you go between 6 and 8 make sure you make reservations (or go later like we did)"}
{"text":"We have golfed at Las Sendas many times and would stop at the Patio afterwards for lunch and cocktails.  Our experience there has been the same for the last several months.  The service is super slow and Christy(sp) is extremely rude.  She can't seem to smile, she makes you feel like you are inconveniencing her by being there.  We really enjoy the view and the food at Las Sendas, but she needs to go.  Peter on the other hand is wonderful.  He goes the extra step to make you overlook Christy's poor service."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is just soooo slow.  Even worse, they don't care.   Have been there a couple of times, and same crappy service each time.  Have to stop going there.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot in the heart of Las Sendas! All of the staff have been super friendly - there is often a live band or performer in the evening - and the food is very good! Expect to spend a little bit more $, but the ambiance is worth It. Don't visit if you are in a rush - It is a more relaxed dining experience - but very worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and beautiful setting when you sit outside. Menu changes often but not always for the good. They have gotten rid of a lot of my favorite dishes...pretzel turkey Rueben, chicken mozzarella sandwich. Seems like when I find something I like it goes away!"}
{"text":"1st time here and I really enjoyed it. Started with the pear martini yum! Then moved to the queso dip for an app. Queso was delicious. I had the coconut shrimp and holy smokes so good. Finished with the creme brûlée and it did not disappoint. We had great service from Jenae and the view from the patio was beautiful. Unfortunately we were there at dusk so we were attacked by mosquitos and had to relocate inside. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here half a dozen times. I have always had a good food and service. There has been live music. The sun sets while you enjoy your food your food in the evening. Nothing bad to say. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Generally speaking if a place has good food and bad service I will overlook the bad service. Well this place has terrible service and very mediocre food. The view is nice and the queso is good. Beyond that there is nothing worth going here for. A suggestion I have for The Patio is better more attentive, happy waitresses. I can go anywhere in the valley and get a dose of attitude from 20 year old girls for FREE. I prefer my lunch attitude free. Another suggestion I have is if there is mostly sandwiches to eat here add something besides salad for people who eat gluten free even if its just corn tortillas. I would and could overlook the bland food if I felt like the staff genuinely cared when they ask how is your lunch. Muttering \"enjoy\" and then perking up when you bring the bill will not your saving grace to obtain a tip."}
{"text":"The view gets five stars; however, I can only give the food and service two stars. We had reservations for 6:30pm, the outside was pretty empty and no hostess insight; my husband went inside to see about getting seated and was told \"there are two reserved tables out there, pick the one you want.\", so we seated ourselves. Thursday night is Prime Rib night, we ordered it; no soup or salad and no rolls. It wasn't bad but not at all what we expected from the reviews we had read. We'll go back for the view and drinks/appetizers but not for dinner."}
{"text":"While in town for a month, we had dinner at The Patio four times.  The food varies from average (prime rib inconsistent)  to quite excellent (burger, salmon).  It deserves four stars because all servers we had were excellent and very pleasant; the venue is wonderful in terms of the view and music; the wine selection is pretty good; and the food is more often than not very good.  When you add it all up, it is a nice dining option."}
{"text":"Went there last nite for supper on the Patio. We were seated right away. Water etc came right away Service was excellent. Wine was great, and food delicious. Going back Sunday nite"}
{"text":"Big points for the view and ambience.  Great place to have a drink and look at the city lights.  Bread pudding is really good.  Otherwise food is average."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm into views and the patio has one, but beyond that there is nothing to recommend being treated so very poorly by staff!   We have gone here for years and enjoyed their some times bumpy ride, but the last three times have been over the top in ruddiness by the hostess, a man with more negative attitude than someone with this kinda job should have, and the wait staff.  So , missing the view is the price of rudeness for us, we will not return, too many other places to explore without view but without attitude!!"}
{"text":"The service- 5 stars The views- 5 stars. The appetizers- 5 stars The side dishes - 5 stars The drinks- 4 stars The steaks - 0 stars. Absolutely the worst steak I have ever attempted to eat.  My wife got the rib eye and I got the filet.  Mushy, like it was over tenderized and it appears their grill does not get hot as we both ordered medium and both were served well done.  Cooked us up some new filets. This time they were well done on the outside, a bit of pink in the middle.  The meat smelled bad.  Truly inedible. We just skipped having a main course.  Everything else about the place was so charming, we would go back for drinks and appetizers, but we don't have the stomach to try main courses again."}
{"text":"The best place to watch the sunset in Mesa. Just beautiful, great service, food, and drinks. Sometimes they have live music on the weekends too. I have to check out their breakfast as well."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant about trying this place based on some of the reviews, but we were so happy we went!  The service was good.  I wouldn't call it slow, I would say it was at a relaxed pace.  But we weren't in a hurry, we were there to enjoy the view and have a nice dinner so I wouldn't want to be rushed anyway.   My husband ordered the double cut pork chop with broccolini and polenta.  The chop was delicious and the sides were as well.  I ordered the chicken pad thai.  It was good, but for some reason the sauce was creamy, which isn't how pad thai is normally prepared.  It did say on the menu that the sauce was creamy but I didn't give it much thought.  After tasting my husband's chop, I was sorry that I hadn't ordered that instead.   I would guess that this is more of a steak place, so I would suggest sticking with the steaks/chops. We noted on our reservation that we wanted a seat with a view and they sat us on the edge of the patio as requested.  Everyone on the wait staff was incredibly friendly. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday and it was fairly busy with people watching football and dining on the patio. Reservations are a good idea if you want to dine on the patio and enjoy the views. We saw all the comments about slow service but that wasn't the case for us. Everyone in our party thought their food was great. I had the Maricos and have not complaints, nor did my hubby who had the Bison meatloaf.  In summary, beautiful views, fast, friendly service and great food!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I went here today for breakfast and we were really dissapointed! We had 2 kids with us so we decided to sit on the patio as it was a gorgeous day. We were seated right away but sat for 10 minutes before the waiter got to us! Even the table that came after us had their drinks. We ordered coffee and when he served it, it was in styrofoam cups as they were out off coffee cups! They were not busy so we are not sure where they all went but he did bring the spoons in a coffee mug. Go figure. When the food came it was lukewarm but good so thats the reason I gave 3 stars, even though we had a long wait for that too,"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests but this particular night was an off night for them.  Came for dinner and sat outside majority of the heaters were working except ours.  The service was horrible!  We got our waters right away but our server took forever to get our drink order.  Once we ordered our drinks it took awhile to get them and then everyone got their beer & wines except for my Prosecco and gave the excuse the bar was backed up.  So, I went to the main bar to order my drink and the bartender was on his phone. Really?  Anyhow, we eventually all got our drinks and ordered our food.  Thursday night was their Prime Rib special which ordered and the server stated they tend to cook more on the rare side so I ordered medium rare and it came out very medium hardly any pink inside.  It wasn't that great.  Everyone else at our table were pretty satisfied with their food choices.  As I looked around everyone around us was waiting for something the check, more water, more drinks so the service was super slow this evening."}
{"text":"One star for the great service from Trevor and the good cocktails. View is best in Mesa hands down and it was really enjoyable sitting on the patio on this rare cool day. Downer? The food was horrible. One appetizer, pretzel bites with beer cheese. Pretzel bites tastes like dust they were so stale and the cheese was from a can for sure. Check the same item at the HUB to see how it's done.    This place is upscale, gorgeous and should have top notch everything.    Also noted, at 4:00 on a Friday there were exactly 2 tables occupied and one was ours.   I am always shocked when a place so beautiful serves bad food. Talk about \"not living up to your potential.\""}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and ambience on Valentines Day! I'm glad I made this reservation early to get in for supper on Feb 14! Wasn't disappointed ! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from the patio view to the menu and service. Had an extremely professional manager approach us about our fantastically behaved blue nose pit bull service dog. Can I add everyone treated us respectfully and we will be back again."}
{"text":"We only visited once, and it was just for drinks at sunset so this review is limited. The service was pleasant but a little slow, the beer was cold, the view... Outstanding!!!! Menu prices were on the higher side, but we'll probably go back for a meal as the food looked delicious. Very busy place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and check out the views. It's awesome in the afternoon, but at sunset the place really shines. Decent food and a very friendly waitstaff make this a regular place to visit on my rotation."}
{"text":"We had Mother's Day reservations for brunch.  We waited 75 min. for our food.  Ok, its a special day but the kitchen seemed totally unprepared.   This was a pre-set short menu - the chef that created it should of had a staff that could handle it, or go with easier items. Eggs benny eggs came way over done,  fresh fruit was a boring watermelon and cants.  Just average food. We have been here twice and had bad experiences both times.  Probably won't risk it again just for the nice view. MICHAEL, our server was awesome!  He gets 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"This is such a shame because yes the view and sunsets are great. Service very slow, food poor. This place has gone from poor to very good and poor again on the last 12 years I have lived in the area. I keep wanting to take clients here, but can't because I end up embarrassed. Last 2 times have had to send food back after waiting forever and last time ordered the Ahi Salad. After 15 minutes, our waitress came back and said they were out of Ahi. Hope someone in management reads this and understands that people want to come here but you are forcing them to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the live music on the patio and the view of the sunset.  It was a chilly evening however the heaters kept us warm.  The chartcurtie board was delish  and my martini was spot on. I was so happy they have bleu cheese olives!  I got the 7oz filet, medium. It came well done & a bit crispy. The waiter had another made immediately and it came out lightening fast. Perfectly cooked.   I believe I had just gotten someone else's steak at first.   The manager came to our table and apologized. Now THAT is great customer service!  They made it right and made us happy!  The asparagus was great, and I couldn't get enough of the fingerling potatoes.   My friend had the bison meatloaf and thoroughly enjoyed it.   We will be back and back again!"}
{"text":"I was going to review this place on the negative side tonight, but changed my mine after thinking more about it. We live very close and have been here several dozen times. We always sit on their spectacular patio and enjoy the evening views. Tonight it looked like a completely different cadre of employees, including management. Service was very slow or none existent in light of the place that aww  didn't have that many customers when we arrived.  As strange as it may seem, I'm covering this place positively because of management. UPDATE: 9/6/2017 We decided to try this place again now that the weather is nice and boy were we pleasantly surprised! The new fall menu was outstanding. I had the Bison meatloaf and the wife had the chefs special of grilled shrimp in a light cream sauce over bow tie pasta. Both of these dishes were excellent. Plus you can't beat the view! We definetly will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great view. Great food. Great service. Had such a nice outdoor lunch!  Loved the Cobb salad & the tacos looked amazing. The outdoor experience is worth the trip up the mountain!"}
{"text":"Food is great & atmosphere is amazing!! What I find beyond frustrating is the fact u can not make a reservation & the ridiculous menus on different areas of the establishment. I called about making a reservation multiple times with parties from 4 to at 1 point 17 of us!! The are extremely unaccommodating & the staff seems like they could careless!! The place clears out by 8ish due to the older clientele. I've sat there & watched open tables but because for some ridiculous polices they have to wait & see. This is pretty pathetic how irritating this is & I have written all about their rules & not about how much I love their food!! Foods great but if you don't have time to wait & sit don't go!! Hopefully management will make an adjustment!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food couldn't help the service that we received. Having lived in the area I knew my way around Las Sendas but had never eaten at The Patio - so I gave the restaurant a call while sitting in my car outside of Bogey's to ask for directions, my specific questions was, \"Where are you in relation to Bogey's?\". The sweet girl on the phone said she couldn't help me with that and she would need to get me a manager. The manager hopped on and I repeated my question - she told me they were right behind Bogey's, I just needed to walk down the path and I would see their door. (Your hostess should really have been able to answer that question...) Anyway, we arrived for our reservations at 5:30 and were quickly seated at a dirty table (when there were multiple, clean, set tables around us) and I asked if she could wipe the table down. The sweet girl (same one on the phone) said she would need to check if that was OK. Someone must have told her we could just sit at a clean table so we were settled in and ready to order. Our waiter arrived promptly and let us know we had 10 minutes left for happy hour (even though the menu and website stated it was supposed to go on for another hour) so we quickly ordered our drinks and munchies and said we would look at the menu to order our entrees. 45 minutes later we were finally able to flag our waiter down to place our meal order. :/  While we were eating we watched other tables around us receive bread/butter/have cloth napkins placed on their laps....basically receive the kind of service we expected from Las Sendas Patio. In the end, our server accidentally put in a drink order twice (so we received an extra cocktail but couldn't drink it since we were all driving), put the wrong cut of meat in for one of our dinners, and we had to flag our server down for spoons, for the check, and finally I just held the check/credit card over my head until a bus boy picked it up and brought it to him. We know our server can give great service as we saw him provide it to the regulars who were seated around us. We won't be back - even thought their food is ridiculously delicious and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere outside and view of hills and cactus. Food was great as was service."}
{"text":"During the summer the Patio Grill has a decent happy hour. Cocktails are tasty, relatively strong and a bargain at $5. They have a good selection of appetizers under $7. I highly recommend the pretzels and cheese.   Outside of happy hour I can't speak to the quality of the food. Also, they ONLY have happy hour during the summer. We stopped by in March and were unpleasantly surprised. According to our server, the place is packed with tourists and snowbirds for the rest of the year so they have no need offer deals to bring in the locals."}
{"text":"My wife and I joined friends at the Patio to celebrate Thanksgiving. Unfortunately the entire experience left little to be thankful for. The menu offered a holiday selection of approximately 4 entrée choices, 3 appetizers and 2 desert choices. The four entrees ordered included, Prime Rib, Halibut, Pork Loin and Turkey. All were delivered well below acceptable temperature, disappointingly dry and altogether unappealing. The food was reminiscent of a day gone very wrong at the high school cafeteria.   Had the server or management checked back surely a fix or an accommodation could have been provided. Plates were whisked away and dessert arrived at the same time. Coffee and tea were not offered.  One in our party requested fruit as a substitute for the cheesecake and gelato offered. The server responded, \"No substitutes allowed\". This was the same server that toppled a number of wine glasses off of a nearby tray while pushing them to the side with her foot and arguing with a diner that the glasses on the floor posed no danger to anyone.   On a Thanksgiving note the view from the Patio is quite beautiful and the music was very nice."}
