{"text":"My GF and I LOVE to eat here as part of our rotation of favorite eateries in the Scottsdale area (or vicinity). They always produce consistent quality food with a wide selection of Japanese & Chinese dishes, which we appreciate. The staff is always friendly and the service is quick. The prices are decent.. this place is definitely a GO!"}
{"text":"I ordered sushi rolls (Spicy California and shrimp tempura) which were tasting pretty good. The hostess who took my order was extremely polite and since I had ordered for delivery she mentioned it would involve a mile based charge ($1 per mile). But she got the distance wrong to my place at first and over-charged me. Then I get a call back from her after 10 mins where she corrected my bill, and politely offered me a complimentary bowl of miso soup for the inconvenience. Really nice service at the place, and the taste was def good. The only flaw I could see was the size of the rolls was a bit smaller than I expected. But all in all, I had a very positive experience eating at the place! 4 stars! :)"}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place I go to!! I'm not a sushi snob but I know going out for sushi can get pricey and sometime you're taking a chance of bad seafood for not being fresh. My boyfriend and I go here almost twice a week and sometime more. This is like our second home lol.. Every time we dine here the sushi is always consistently superb and the presentation looks great too! Plus one of the waitress know us so well that we don't even have to tell her what we need at times. She is one exceptionally awesome waitress. Lately, we decided to branch out and try their Chinese food entree and wow, their house chowmein is mind blowing. The sauce was so yummy. Like I said, their prices is so reasonable for their roll and quality of the food is awesome-- I would give this place 10 stars. 

P.s.. the place is kinda small for dining.. but it's very clean and weekend crowd can be hectic. I just noticed the outside patio MIGHT be dog friendly cause I saw someone brought a dog."}
{"text":"We just had a fun and relaxing Sunday lunch. The food was excellent. We had all you can eat sushi. It was a limited menu that included almost all my favorites, even eel. (No squid or scallops.) The only portion limit was on sashimi. It was a generous 12 pieces. More than enough since each piece was large. We want to thank our server Wang who was very friendly and attentive. Thank you Iron Chef for taking such good care of us."}
{"text":"The won ton soup was the best ever.  Service was great and the sushi was fresh.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Simply the best takeout experience I've had, time and time again with impressive consistency. 

They are always so friendly, and offer you a soft drink while you wait and will occasionally give you some soup as well. 

The contents of the bags I skip out of there with are the real gem though.

Sushi: mouth watering, inventive, large rolls. Can't go wrong. I've tried most, and they are all delicious. Specifics? Go Snow White and Spicy Tuna Mango.

Food: I've only had the Singapore chow Mai fun, because it's that good. Get egg drop wonton soup with it to complete the symphony of deliciousness. 

The best part? Prices that still puzzle me. Pound for pound, tied as my favorite sushi place in town."}
{"text":"They have recently changed their happy hour to include all hrs of the day. That means half priced sushi ALL DAY LONG EVERYDAY. 

There is nowhere in Arizona you can come to get fresh, restaurant-served sushi this cheap. Almost all rolls are either 40-50% off. Not to mention, their sushi is amazing! They have sooooo many different combinations to choose from- many I have never seen anywhere else. Everyone HAS to try their deep fried sushi. It's to die for. 

I am so sad to see all the bad reviews (which seems to be over some kind of groupon fiasco). The restaurant is adorable, the servers have always been great, and like I said above, you won't find sushi this delicious AND this cheap anywhere else in Arizona."}
{"text":"I have seen this place for years but wasn't sure about it. So glad we finally tried it! Everything we had was delicious! I will defiantly go back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi . The service was great . Prices were very reasonable . I like rockin roll .."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have eaten at Iron Chef. Its pretty good sushi and its right by my house.  The server next door at Nicks had told me it was dirty and the kitchen was gross. I don't know why but I decided to try it out again.  Immediately my napkin had a long black hair on it...I wasn't too upset just asked for a new plate.  Then my boyfriends plate was sticky...he asked for a new plate...my soy sauce cup had an old piece of rice in it...asked for a new one of those too...the server kept apologizing which was nice but come on...3 dirty things and we haven't even gotten our food yet! Our sushi arrived and it was ok...it wasn't as cold as I would like which worried me.  They gave us a cucumber salad for free...wow thanks. It's decent sushi for a really good price you just have some risks involved when you go there with cleanliness..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. I have been to many great sushi places in the area but Iron Chef is my favorite! They are efficient, affordable, and consistently down-right good. I know that every time I order from Iron Chef that it will not disappoint.

I bought a groupon randomly for Iron Chef in 2012 (?) and have been a loyal customer since. The staff is attentive and very friendly when you dine-in and the food is just as good when you take-out. The only thing I haven't tried is delivery. They have online ordering for pick-up which is awesome for the days you don't feel like talking with anyone ;)

Their deals are awesome, too - you can't pass them up! Happy Hour and Summer Specials and other random deals I've seen - 40% or 50% off rolls? I'll take it."}
{"text":"we wanted to give this newer local place a try. Unfortunately it was the worst tasting Japanese food I've ever had. The very greasy teriyaki chicken and egg roll tasted like rancid oil and left a terrible taste in my mouth. My son thought the miso in his soup tasted sour and the overly thickened egg drop soup had no flavor. I told the waitress and she offered to give me the same order to go. ???? no thanks."}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant.

The first time I went there, it was for takeout and they gave us free drinks and free salads.  That was a good impression to start, but then I tasted the sushi and I was blown away!

This is my favorite place for sushi in Phoenix, and it's great to hit happy hour because it's really affordable.  (though it is still worth it even when it's not happy hour)

The Samurai roll is phenomenal, as is the Rock n Roll.  My boyfriend says their chicken wings are absolutely perfect.

I can't think of anything I didn't like about them!"}
{"text":"Another groupon trail ...
The place is located in the PV area ... easy to find and nice area.  The place seems clean and nice ... I think it is trying too hard to be a fusion/sushi/sport bar to cater everyone which just doesn't really work ... having buffalo chicken wing and a big screen playing hockey can't qualify you to be a sport bar 

Had some sushi roll and nigiri  ... the texture of the rice just not right ... you can't use chinese/thai rice to make sushi, it just simply not is... and had the cucumber wrap with tuna inside ... good try but the cucumber are sliced too thick (this is where you can see the skill of the chef) that the dish is losing its essence.

Though I would give them credit for the pricing ... it's good price given its location. Also, even if you are not at Happy hour, you can get 1/2 off sushi for yelp check in."}
{"text":"This place is so great and they offer 50% off all sushi all the time.  Everything is fresh and the staff is nice and non-invasive.  Their fried rolls are amazing--just a little rice flour on the outside!  I love the sunomono salad and they have sweet tofu skin (inari) which I don't see a lot.  They also have a cute outside seating area.  This is my go-to sushi spot so give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi at unbelievable prices.  Been there 3 times in the last two weeks."}
{"text":"I'm really liking this place... It's super convenient, in a great location.  I enjoy walking around after I eat so there are shops all around.

It's a small restaurant but we've never had to wait for a seat even though they seem really busy most of the time.  They have a lil patio area if you want to sit outside.  

The food is pretty good especially for the price... It's happy hour all the time... Everyday.  My favorite roll is the Yummy Yummy... I know they have more than just sushi... They have a Chinese and Japanese cuisine but I've only had the sushi and some appetizers.  One day I'll try something different.  

The service is ok... I would advise to be patient when they are busy... I'm usually not in a hurry and not impatient so I can care less if the service isn't the best... I go there for the food and the price.  Which is above average... And that's what matters to me."}
{"text":"This place has some good sushi!! The lunch special are amazing....Only $10 for soup,salad, 2 rolls(of your choice) and 2 slices of california roll!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"As a sushi lover, I am a huge fan of this place. It's very close to where I live, so I can ride my bike here. Their sushi is tasty and reasonably priced, even before they give you 40% off. The prices are so good you might find yourself eating there a couple of times a week (or more! Who can be sure?) The staff is nice and friendly, and are generous with regulars. They also have tasty appetizers and House Lo Mein. They have drink specials, sports on TV, and are open late (10:30). I have never had a negative experience here. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time last night and this morning both have food poisoning. We eat sushi all the time and have never had a bad experience until now.  And they don't use a real (smooth, fluffy) tempura batter for the shrimp tempura (a trivial matter in comparison but noteworthy)."}
{"text":"I am a serious sushi lover and this is my favorite sushi place I've discovered so far. This is the only place I will eat sushi at and I bring all my friends and family here and they all love it too. Their green mussels and eel cucumber roll are my favorite and I get them at least once a week."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. The rock and roll and sunshine roll were delicious. The owner even gave us some crispy salmon because it was our first time visiting. I would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great price! Staff is a bit absent, but not to the detriment of the meal. Recommended!"}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER! Seriously, how can you go wrong with half off ANY roll on the menu??? You can't! And they even have happy hour twice a day! So if you miss the early happy hour, you can still come for the late one.

Thank you Groupon for leading me to Iron Chef! This is by far my favorite place to eat sushi. So far I have been three times but you can bet if I lived any closer I would probably be here every week. They have a nice sized selection of veggie rolls, all of which I have tried. They are simple, but the avocado rolls, and the sweet potato tempura rolls are by far my favorite. The rolls are also nicely sized themselves. I never leave here hungry for sure. The last time we were here, we ordered so many rolls that they brought them all out on a bridge! It was pretty awesome.

The service is really great as well. Everyone who works here is really friendly. 

If you haven't been here yet, try it. Vegetarians and fish lovers all will be happy with the selection here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, awesome food!  We have been in several times for the lunch special.  We do not like sushi but their soups are really great.  Highly recommended for a fair priced, fresh tasting entree!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi for your dollar in Phoenix. Don't get me wrong there are better sushi joints in the valley that have better environments, better sushi and in rare cases both, but none have it for this price. 

I've been here a few times and each experience the staff goes over and above to keep us fat and happy, and with how good the food is, its not that hard. 

If your mango fan, I would recommend the Golden Dragon Roll.

Cost: Cheap
Quality: 4 out of 5
Staff: 5 out of 5

Enjoy this little gem."}
{"text":"I must admit, being from Oregon, when my older brother suggested we get Sushi in Arizona I was a little turned off by the idea of a fish travelling a thousand miles to my plate.  But, alas, This place was pretty damn good.  The restaurant was nice, the service was great and the food was not only pretty good, but fair priced.  We had a Dragon Roll, Phoenix Roll, Arizona Roll, Yellowfin and salmon sashimi.  I highly recommend this place if you're in Scottsdale looking for a sushi place."}
{"text":"The RUSTY Iron Chef -- a forlorn haiku to poor dining

Maybe they were off the night my brother and I went. They did say they were down someone in the kitchen. But that may only be part of the story. The waiter was great at the start (friendly & helpful), but gradually became the incredible disappearing man. By the mid-meal and up until the end, the pattern turned into hide 'n seek -- this happened three times ... for  (1) a greatly delayed order; (2) more sake and water; (3) the check.

 We started with Spring Rolls (good) and Fried Calamari (good 'n plenty chewy -- pencil eraser nubs, anyone?). Then my brother's and pot stickers came. I watched him start and finish ALL of his food while my plate just sat there empty and full of envy. I hunted and chased down our waiter, was told about the missing person behind the counter, and my sushi plate would be ready soon. It ended up taking over 30 minutes. And the quality was sub-standard. The rice under each sushi piece was so dry, it would crumble apart as I would try to lift it off the plate, with chopsticks, then fork and finally spoon. And there was no wasabi smudge under the fish. Although I ordered sushi, what I ended up with was a sampling of sashimi along with a plate of dry, crumbled rice.

So, between the slow service, the vagabond waiter, the chewy calamari and the shoddy sushi ... what else could be said, other than sayonara.

Iron Chef Haiku ...

Waiter can't be found
Neither can the sushi plate
Then rice dry eyes cry"}
{"text":"Service, very nice and accommodating 

Food, everything was amazing. I had the chicken teriyaki with miso soup and fried rice. My wife had the avocado and cucumber roll and the Phoenix roll. 

Atmosphere, looks nice, friendly people, cute and cozy"}
{"text":"What a great find on Yelp! A place that serves amazing sushi rolls as well as great Chinese food. This is a huge score!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for the price, the hand rolls are great.  Nice place to sit on the patio and enjoy some sushi and a beer."}
{"text":"It's my favorite sushi place the price are reasonable. The staff is very friendly and great with my kids."}
{"text":"Service has slowly been improving.  We have gone there every few weeks since it opened.  It's hit or miss whether the food will be promptly served, or will take 1 hour for the first sushi to appear.  As far as all-you can eat sushi goes, I can't think of a better place in Phoenix (and honestly, what all-you-can eat could be healthier than sushi...)

GREAT quality sushi.  A few odd things:
1.  The descriptions of the rolls are on a special menu that you have to request, and even then, there's two rolls that aren't listed and you have to ask what they are.
2.  Ice cream is included in the all-you-can eat price.  However, it is frozen solid into a block of ice frozen into a frozen dish.  It's really inedible.  I bent the spoon trying to hack off a piece.  Disappointing because it's nice to have a bit of soothing dairy after asian cuisine..."}
{"text":"First time here and probably our new favorite sushi spot.  Excellent prices (all rolls 40% off) and service was top notch.  Server even brought our 4 year old chopsticks that were kid friendly so he could participate too!

Food came out quick, looked amazing, and tasted very fresh.  Rolls were a very good size for the price too!  Our drinks were always full, never had to ask for a refill.

After eating they gave us a small roll on the house to try (was a shrimp tempora) and even brought out a desert on the house.

This place went the extra mile.  We will be back many times.  Thanks for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"Delivery sushi that actually is decent quality and the fantail shrimp is really delicious. I gave it four stars because sushi to my door in 20 minutes if freaking awesome. Seafood was really clean too... Yum,"}
{"text":"Really great \"Happy-Hour\" prices! Fresh quality sushi!
But I was mistaken for being pregnant. I'm not pregnant just fat. 
(also don't offer \"complimentary\" soup when you mistake someone for being pregnant, give them a complimentary meal! They're going to need to help with their self esteem.)"}
{"text":"Dry sushi rude waitress. Second time this has happened! We used to love this place. Anyways sad really won't be coming back. Save yourself the trouble there's a reason the sushi is always half price now!"}
{"text":"Best presentation of food. Best sushi restaurant in arizona. Even their fortune cookies taste better than other places lol."}
{"text":"This is a sushi bar, not an upscale restaurant putting on a show with your dinner. That being said, I really like this place. 
Quality, I'd give the food quality alone 3.25 stars. Much better than your average sushi joint, but not the best I've ever had in Manhattan.
There is great customer service. They are super sweet, understanding, and helpful.
It is quick, yummy, and quite satisfying! You leave happy."}
{"text":"If you order delivery on a regular basis they give you free food. The people care about your satisfaction and they charge less for the same food as other restaurants. Full of cute girls, alcoholic beverages, and the patio is the perfect enclave."}
{"text":"The Tuna Tataki was perfectly seared and beautifully presented. The Sashimi was generous and delightfully presented on a bed of diakon. The little surprise was two pieces of eel sushi blessed with the proper sauce. The requisite rice bowl completed a lunch that I could barely complete. I could eat here often (if I lived in Phoenix/Scottsdale). But I visit from time to time and will come back!"}
{"text":"Best value in the Valley, no doubt! EVERY DAY EVERY TIME is half price sushi, and I know what you're thinking in terms of quality, but it's here where Iron Chef shines. The food quality is on par with any typical full-priced restaurant, plus the sushi selection is comprehensive with dozens of specialty rolls as well as basic staples. Hot dishes are another good option, though we generally stick to the vegetable tempura, and the staff is kind and efficient. Ambience is casual yet orderly, and the restroom is always squeaky clean, even if the soy condiments are often stcky. Our favorite and highly frequented sushi house comes with full recommendations."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with a Restaurant.com certificate that I purchases in April 2012.  When I presented the certificate to the waitress I was told it was not good anymore.  I pointed out there was no expiration date on it and she got the manager who came over with a pen and started underlining things on the certificate.  At this time I told him we would find another restaurant and we got up and left.  Do not go to this restaurant because they will try to talk you out of using gift certificates, coupons etc. Very few people there on A Saturday night at 7:00.  This should tell you something about the food and service."}
{"text":"Bella the waitress is beyond the best of the west ! She's a doll ! Sushi is cheap and amazaballs ! Wouldn't go anywhere else but here ! 5 star deal"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Friendliest staff. Especially Bella, She is the sweetest person you'll ever meet! Only sushi place I go to now. Love being there!"}
{"text":"We ate here in March and the food was amazing. We had a teriyaki dish and several selections of sushi. We thought it was great and planned to go back. The second visit was not nearly as good as the first. I had a salad that looked like someone had vomited on it. The chicken katsu was disgusting. It was really greasy and the taste was horrible. My husband had fried rice that was fried to the point of being burnt. I don't know if the kitchen was having a bad  night or what, but our return visit was disappointing."}
{"text":"Probably won't go back, given all the amazing sushi places but it was right down the fairway good. Nothing amazing but decent for the price.  Service sucked, the server didn't really seem to care and would drop our plate on the table as she walked past without even paying attention to placement or making eye contact. One of the plates she almost knocked the salt shaker off the table when she literally dropped the plate on the table and didn't even notice."}
{"text":"Good food but service is horrific they were not even busy and the waitress was in a rush with everything she was doing rushed us to order drinks and picked up plates before even asking with food stil on it while trying to eat!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and unfortunately will not be going back. Tonight we had a takeout order of 7 rolls... The sushi rolls were way over packed with rice-little fish and not 1 of the rolls stayed together(had to fork it). They also forgot 2 different toppings on 2 separate rolls. It seems as the restaurant has gotten more popular, they have put less effort into pushing out quality product. I can understand if they were busy- but there were 2 people in the restaurant and 5 sushi chefs behind the bar. Great deals, but at what cost?"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and was impressed with the sushi and to top it off all the rolls were half off. Big plus! Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour since it's half price on ALL sushi rolls (most places have a limited menu for happy hour and they even have the same happy hour on the weekends)  & the all you can eat sushi includes drinks (If you want beer it's only $2.50 extra), appetizers, soup, salad, sashimi, nigiri, rolls (even specialty rolls), and desert all for only $24.95 and is available all day every day so you can't really beat that. They sushi is fresh and the Chinese tastes better than most other Chinese places in the area. Special requests are always welcome and the owner will go out of his way to please. Very good atmosphere. I definitely recommend trying the place at least once because I'm sure you'll be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am not joking when I say I eat here at least 2 times a month. For the price, you will not find better sushi.
The staff is friendly and fast. This is a great date night spot and they have happy hour all day everyday for dine in!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good and cheap! We had 6 people and it cost us a little more than 100 with alcoholic drinks! It was the best Japanese place I've found in Arizona.
We will be back and I will ask to have this dinner for every date night. I'm bringing my mom back when she comes in town this week!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and prices! They are always super nice and even when we were about to order delivery he reminded us that if we picked up we would get 40% off! Very fast professional and delicious! Would strongly recommend."}
{"text":"I took my family on  Friday.  It was busy but we got table. It took a while to get drinks ordered and once the sushi came, the rolls were full of rice and not enough fish. We've eaten at most better known sushi restaurants in the Valley and we were hoping that this would be a new place we could frequent. Unfortunately, the service and the food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"we are big Shogun fans which is just north of this restaurant, but a clear altenative for a change of scenery and sushi and sashimi choices.  hasn't been too crowded and we always feel welcome.  the sashimi was fresh and a generous portion cut for the smallest selection.  we are now frequent diners at Iron Chef"}
{"text":"The half price sushi at happy hour is fresh and great and generous portions, the service has always been great, and I enjoy going there all the time. It is the best bargain and kept secret in Phoenix, dont pass up on it"}
{"text":"I was not completely impressed with the chief specialty menu. He used onions on a dynamite roll...that was a first for me. The regular rolls were tasty and thick. But still nothing to rave about. However the regular rolls are priced decently."}
{"text":"Amazing deals and sushi is to die for. Japanese alcohol and specialty sushi. Great place, first time here and I am in love."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place in the area! 
Staff are always pleasure, good food, good prices and love listening to those Asian music. 
They know how to take care of their customers. Sushi is always great. Try their Udon soup and Tempura. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Iron Chef has a great 50% all sushi rolls after 8pm. The rolls we ordered were amazing. We had: a Rainbow Roll, Golden Dragon and a Phoenix Roll. Because we had never eaten at Iron Chef before our waitress gave us complimentary sake.  Iron Chef is tiny so get there right at 8pm for the start of happy hour or you will have to wait to get a seat.

This place is definitely worth checking out and I will be going back every week."}
{"text":"I give anyone that catches me walking into this place my permission to punch me in the head. I went there not once, not twice...but three times and to say it sucks...would be to give it a compliment. They brought our salmon over to the table and it smelled like a fish that had been laying on the banks of the canals that run thru phx on a 115 degree temps for days!!! Watching my friend try to eat it was like putting peanut butter on the roof of a dogs mouth...they kept chewing, chewing and chewing til they spit it out. Go Brokers, go Koytos in scottsdale...go anywhere but here. They did however have good bottled beer in which they had not one bit of control over the quality..."}
{"text":"I couldn't have been happier with the food, service, and specials. All around plus for me. The rolls were fantastic and presentation was creative and executed well. The staff here recognizes regulars and treats them like special guests, I will be coming back here often. The happy hour is better than any happy hour anywhere else with every single roll on it at half price. I felt a very welcoming presence here and it made me very comfortable. It's got that neighborhood vibe. Ask for the daily special rolls not listed on the menu, they have a secret list and you can order from it anytime if you know what to order ;)"}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner and left satisfied. We had the cucumber salad, edamame, miso soup and 2 sushi rolls. I would pass on the cucumber salad- it was essentially tossed in sugar water- extremely sweet. The rest of the food was good. The miso was excellent and the sushi was fresh. I had an eel roll- but it didn't have much eel in it, although it was still delicious. We also ordered the spicy yellowtail, also good but nothing to write home about. If you are in the area, definitely get some rolls to go. Also, they have a permanent \"40% off rolls\" printed on top of their menu- so I would recommend giving them a chance while this promotion still stands! All in all, quality sushi for Phoenix."}
{"text":"The sushi was great!!  We have nothing bad to say about it...  However, the service, TERRIBLE.  

About 30 seconds go by When she asked if we knew what we wanted.  Got pissy When we said no.  But we did order sodas and crab puffs.  When she brought us our drinks, she slammed them down, so hard, people turned and looked.  Didn't come back for probably 15-20 minutes later we are waiting on them, she comes back and takes our order.  I order a corona,  she brings it back, slams it, and an on the rocks glass next to my husband and diagnal from me...  Not to me....  She still has no smile, and never did.  

The Rangoon was brought with the rolls.  Not as an appetizer.  She keeps coming back every 5 minutes to try and get us to close out the tab.  I couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there.  

If you are ok with good food and the most non friendly service ever, then this place is for you.  However, Service is very important to me, so for this reason only...  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place. They advertise that it's happy hour all the time here and it really is. I'm happy at all times when I'm eating here, so that pretty much confirms it. They use that to get you in the door, but it's really well priced for sushi. The quality is quite good and always tastes fresh. It can get a little crowded inside, but I guess that could be seen as a good thing. They have a huge menu and lots of specialty rolls to choose from. Good sushi, at a good price, happy guy!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! We came during the week when the sushi rolls were discounted. I'm not sure if they are discounted on weekends, but we will definitely be back either way. 
There are so many rolls to choose from, and with the discounts, they were all very affordable. 
We used to go to an all you can eat sushi restaurant and ended up paying $26 a person (which was totally worth it because we eat a lot of sushi). At Iron Chef, our tab with quite a few rolls and 1 beer each was $30 total. We were stuffed!"}
{"text":"I live their sushi and you can't beat the prices. I'm forever done with sushi restaurants that charge up to $20/roll. 2 adults ordered 3 rolls and the bill came to $16! Couldn't believe it! And it was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Customer service is on point.  We have dined/take out twice and both times they have been so nice.  Food is worth the price.  Menu has a good variety.  This will be our go to place for family sushi dinner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.  They have really reasonable prices which most sushi is 50% off.  It's not the very best sushi that I ever had, but it's still really good.  The problem with really good sushi is your gonna spend a lot of money for it.  If you want something that is a little less in quality, but still good, give this place a try.  My girlfriend and I usually spend 30 to 40 bucks for dinner, while a high end sushi you'll spend twice that much.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. This place is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch twice now. Both times I had excellent sushi! Fresh and tasty. Service is efficient. I sat in the outdoor patio area both times because I had my puppy with me. Love the shady dog friendly patio.

Great selection of sushi and other Asian cuisine. This is my go-to sushi place when I'm out and about. Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Iron Chef serves great sushi and cooked Japanese and Chinese dishes, the ambiance is pleasant, and the servers are extremely efficient and professional.

I love the Golden Dragon Roll, which I get almost every time.  I also like the chicken yaki udon, and my boyfriend likes the kung pao chicken.

YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Vacationing in Scottsdale recently and felt the craving for sushi they had 40% off a great selection of their rolls and we decided to get a california and a vegas roll both were very tasty and plated eloquently which i didnt expect to see due to the price reduction the teriyaki chicken was great as well full of veggies and chicken. i highly recommend Iron Chef"}
{"text":"This was our second choice after driving to what I thought was an Asian restaurant and it was really a glorified Panda. So we arrive at close to 9p to find the place is still in full swing and serving until 10:30 even on a Tuesday!
  They have a near special that is but a drink get $2 app so we ordered the crab Rangoon and spring roll both of which were nicely crunchy and made just right.
  Hubby ordered the Kung Pao  and subbed low mein noodles for the rice. Portioning was significant and had the kick he was looking for.
  I ordered to sushi rolls.... Found a spot in my top three for these guys! They have a HUGE list of chef specials that are unique or take a unique spin on the traditional. The SUPER volcano was AMAZING! Nice sauce, huge topping of crab, AND it was served with a lovely fire in the middle of the plate. Talk about presentation. The other was Snow White which I got for the heat and it delivered.

Service was prompt and our wait attendant was very accommodating."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best sushi rolls, fabulous service and great pricing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! All you can eat sushi for $30. The all you can eat menu includes soft drinks, soup/salad, sushi, sashimi, rolls, and ice cream to top it all off. The food quality was great and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Best authentic sushi in the valley. The Chinese food is really good as well. Great service and great prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Flew in from Houston for a conference and this was hands on the best meal of the week."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped in for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean.  Our server Dan was knowledgeable and pleasant. The food was average but good for the price. We will definately be back."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place and it was okay.

The sushi selection was wide but lacked on taste and presentation.  I order the octopus rolls but the cut was terrible instead of nice sweet meat I got the fatty chewy portions on all 4 of the rolls.

I was hoping for better based on reviews but this place disappointed I've still yet to find a good sushi joint in Phoenix"}
{"text":"First time here. I got take out. Kung pao chicken and wonton soup. Definitely one of the best
Kung pao chicken dishes I have had. Service was quick but excellent and friendly. I'll be back. They also have a low fat weight watchers menu."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from one of my buddy's. This is probably the best quality sushi you will find at value you are paying. I have been here numerous times now and is my go to sushi place! Highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place through Groupon and are very glad we did!  We ordered some of the chef special rolls and they were phenomenal!  Really good.  Portions were big without overloading with rice!  We'll definately be going back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I used to work in the restaurant industry so I know and understand what \"good service\" entails. Needless to say this establishment is an absolute joke. Where should I begin...

The food- The sushi here is beyond disappointing. Not only is the presentation sloppy but I'm totally seriously when I say that it looked as if the chef threw it on the plate and sent it out, without a bat of an eye (rolls falling apart, wasabi and ginger missing, old rice particles stuck to the plate). Okay I can live with a sloppy presentation, but what I cannot deal with is fish that tastes as if its been sitting out all day long, not in a cooler (it was at best room temp, if not warm to some others opinion.) not a good sign. Old hard rice that was for sure a few days old. I'm sorry but this is unacceptable (especially when it comes to raw fish).

The service - The customer service at this establishment is beyond atrocious. A friend and I decided that we wanted sushi late one night. (8pm) We arrived, only to be ignored in an empty restaurant. I walked over to a staff member and asked if we could get some menus and sit outside. The lady nodded at me, said yes, then pointed at the menus. We grabbed the menus and sat ourselves outside. Then we waited... and waited some more... no joke 10-15 minuets had passed and I had to get up and walk inside and ask the same lady for two cups of water. She said  \"ya ya, okay.\" then turned her back and went to grab us two waters (I returned to the table). When she finally brought us our water, she said \"so you ready to order?\". We ordered four rolls, edamame and a bottle of unfiltered sake. 25 min later she brought us our food. One of the rolls was wrong, but at this point we were so hungry we ate it any way (we still haven't received the sake we ordered). While we are about half way into our 2nd roll a man comes out of the restaurant and begins unplugging all the lights (time now is roughly 9pm and they don't \"close\" until 10:30pm). My friend and I just look at each other in darkness as we sit there on their front patio dumbfounded at what is happening. Our server comes out soon after and asks \"well you need anything thing else or what?\", I then told her that we never received our sake, but that we don't need it anymore because we are more than half way done with our meal. She responded with \"okay, well then you pay now.\" (we still have food on our plates and our water glasses are bone dry) I look at my friend and then just handed the waitress cash for our bill + extra for change for the tip. She walks inside and rings us out but then never returns. We both just sat there waiting for her to come back out and bring us our change and water refills.... Nothing. Then the most amazing thing happened... They turned off the lights inside (time now 9:30). So we look at each other once again in amazement. I get up (again) and walk over to the door to find it locked! That's right you are reading this correctly. They left the restaurant and locked the doors with us still sitting on the patio with all our dishes sitting on the table!!! I have never in my life been to an place of business where the employees left customers at the facility and locked the doors behind them. As you can imagine I never revived my change and left feeling like I was just in the twilight zone.

I will NEVER EVER be back and I suggest you stay far far away from this place. There are several other places close by that have way better food and that won't turn the lights out on you and lock the doors an hour before closing time. Note to the owner - you should think twice about you have managing your business, because from what I've experienced on two separate occasions now, is the most horrific customer service I've ever come across."}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw a groupon come up for this place. I had heard it was really good from more than one person. Man, was I mislead.

My Girlfriend and I started out with some edamame and miso soup. Both of those were pretty good, but not what I came for. We ordered 4 rolls: spicy tuna, avocado eel,  a deep fried one with peanuts and a samurai roll which consisted of a bunch of fish wrapped in seaweed. They ranged from bland to average.  The Samurai roll was the worst offender and I'm sorry to say that we didn't even bother to eat all of it.

I don't think I'll be finding my way back here for sushi any time soon."}
{"text":"Not only was the fish fresh, the wasabi real, and the roll combinations unusual and delicious, the prices affordable, but the service was SPECTACULAR. After one visit, this has become our go to place for sushi in the valley. We've had a few sushi places that we have enjoyed, but they paled in comparison. We will highly recommend Iron Chef to everyone we know."}
{"text":"This place is great.. Happy hour is where it's at like drinks specials!! Unlike yaso down the street where I eat, is priced right for sushi lovers, I do eat at yaso for out of towners and personal lunch when they are open. This place has a good flavor fish and super nice staff. I would definitely go with the sushi platters, soups and drink specials!! Great deal!"}
{"text":"Visited this place today, at first we were surprised there wasn't seating at the sushi bar but in the end we were very satisfied with our meal. Our baby loved the avocado roll and our server was very attentive with us."}
{"text":"We were craving sushi but our normal spot we go to decided to close on Sundays. We stumbled upon Iron Chef and I am so glad we did. All day happy hour, 40% off their specialty rolls, sake bomb specials, extremely attentive staff... Keep in mind we were a large group of 9 people. The waitress we had brought us free salmon steaks (i think that was what it was called) for the table. It was a nice touch :-)
I had the Spicy Tuna Mango Roll and the Tootsie Roll. One of my friends had the Flaming Dragon Roll and the Yummy Yummy. The Flaming Dragon is awesome to watch!
They also have Chinese food on their menu. I got to try their Mongolian beef.
We left full and happy! We will be coming back :-)"}
{"text":"I've dined here on a few occasions to take advantage of their happy hour specials, which is half off of their sushi rolls. They have a good variety of fish and rolls. And the quality of food is pretty reasonable for the price."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ive ever had in my entire life I went in there to get a to go order and I asked them for three different roles and all of the rolls I wanted soy paper then I asked them how much it would be for soy paper and they said $1.50 per roll which I was fine with it sounded pretty reasonable so I get home and I open the box and my sushi is wrapped with lettuce I have never in my life seen something like this and also it tasted horrible and impossible to eat . Very disappointed. Not to mention I paid over twenty dollars for it. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Small sushi restaurant with a high menu. They have 40% off most rolls all the time (I think?). They have martini specials too. Great place for happy hour or a girls night out."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst dining expereance of my life! Went in for my birthday dinner with a group of 9. The service was horrendous. He couldnt answer any of our questions and when i asked what came on dinner sushi orders he grabbed me a to go menu. The waiter didn't take two peoples orders forgot to put another one in and brought out the wrong meals. First bite of my sushi had a bone in it. The salmon and tuna was like beef jerkey. I have never sent a dish back in my life until last night. Nothing i ordered was esible. The bathrooms had water and toilet paper everywhere. Not one person in our party was satisfied. We ended up leaving and eating after. I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after all the good things Ive heard! The orange chicken is the best Ive ever had in my entire life! Really yummy and affordable sushi- I ordered the tootsie roll (as I always order when I get sushi) this was by far the best! Everything came out at a reasonable time and my server was super sweet and took care of my son and I. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed which is a bummer. We ordered the jumbo shrimp and cashews with fried rice, sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, Szechwan beef with white rice, and the crunchy spicy tuna roll to go. We didn't get the white rice at all. The fried rice is flavorless. Everything was bland and the beef dish wasn't spicy AT ALL. The roll was put together very sloppy and very disappointing. Won't be going back sadly."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon here last week and used it that night.  The prices were great and the staff was super friendly.  The sushi was phenomenal!  We ordered the Pink Lady and I could have eaten 6 of them!"}
{"text":"My step mom bought a groupon for this place. Waiter didn't know menu at all and had no idea if salads came with what my parents ordered. My dad ordered shrimp tempura and it was served without any sauce. Step mom ordered katsu and it was served without rice or sauce. After asking for each item, we eventually got the sauces and rice. The food was also served on a doily which made no sense as you're supposed to put sauce on it. I ordered teriyaki and it was pretty bland in taste. The rice was long grain rice, not short grain sticky rice. I didn't try any sushi, but I bet they use long grain for the sushi too.

Food was meh, service was terrible and waiter didn't have a clue.

However, to the reviewer who had the udon and was complaining about the raw egg, having a raw egg cracked in your udon is completely normal..."}
{"text":"Ive come here for lunch many times when I'm in town. They don't disappoint. Service is prompt. Wide selection of sushi. Happy hour specials, can it get any better. 

This time around we ordered the Fuji mountain sushi roll, the Godzilla sushi roll and the pupu platter. Plenty of food for 4. 

They even have a check in special, and Groupons so eating on a budget is doable. Other wise it's as expected moderate to high priced."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed in myself for not walking into this restaurant sooner considering it is less than a mile from where I live!  The service I had was outstanding!  Unfortunately, I did not catch my server's name.  

Iron Chef has the best happy hour ever!  All rolls are 50% off and many other items are 40% off, and they have great drink specials.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 8-10.  I honestly need to come back because I wanted to try 20 things on the menu...they have quite an extensive menu.  

I ended up ordering the squid salad, the ahi tuna martini and spring rolls and a mai tai.  I know I am a piglet, but I did indeed eat it all!  The squid salad was good, not the best I have ever had, but still very delicious.  I cleaned the dish!  The ahi tuna martini was fabulous!  There was tons of fresh, cold tuna and it tasted spectacular with the seaweed, cucumber and the sauce brought it all together.  As you can tell from the picture, it had quite the presentation as well.  Everything at Iron Chef seems to have a lovely presentation in general, I was enjoying watching all the dishes come from the kitchen/sushi bar.  You can tell the spring rolls are made in house; nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are $2!  

Again my server was a doll, I will be sure to catch her name next time!  Everything is very reasonably priced and I hope my fortune cookie is right!"}
{"text":"Eat here at your own risk. I have eaten here two or three times never had anything great happen but never anything terrible. Food was okay, service terrible but they had good specials. I made the mistake of ordering oysters tonight they took twenty minutes to come out. The lady saw me confused as to why I was waiting so long and told me they had just been taken out of the freezer and needed to defrost. At this point I told her if they are not ready I don't want them ( who wants oysters that are defrosted then topped with some chopped onions and some slimy gross tasting yellow muck). She says they are coming right out. They were by far the worst oysters I have ever had. Thinking the taste was from the horrible preparation, disappointed, and disgusted I ate them anyway out of pure starvation. The lady never checked on me to see how it was left my water empty for most the meal and then asked if we wanted anything else. All I wanted was to get out of there I payed the 16.40 and left. I felt sick on the way home and when I got home immediately threw up everything I ate. I called back to complain and let them know the seafood they were serving is not safe. The manager did not care at all about the fact the oysters were sick and only after more complaining offered me a ten dollar credit. Are you f****ing kidding me so I just payed 6 dollars at your restaurant to puke and now I have to come back for the shit food and service another day. Ya right this place is disgusting! I will never eat there again and neither should you lol"}
{"text":"This is the only place in Phoenix that I've found in my 27 years here that serves fried wonton crisps with \"real\" duck sauce. But I wasn't even there for Chinese. We did sushi. I completely and totally approve of this place. It was fast, high quality, and an excellent price performer. I'm only sorry that I waited so long to try it. My neighborhood sushi \"go to\" joint for the last 25 years might become my Plan B."}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious food, and great Chinese songs selection!
If you want some authentic Japanese and Chinese food, you must come here!"}
{"text":"1st time having the all you can eat sushi OMG so many choices all of it was so good.We left with very big sushi bellies!!! And two to go containers."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!  You cannot find better prices and a better selection of creative and tasty sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  The menu just changed and the selection is even bigger.  The Phoenix Roll, the Pink Lady. and the Tuna Martini are must haves!  The happy hour is a don't miss!  Until October 31, the happy hour prices, 50% off all rolls, runs all day long.  If you buy a drink during happy hour, the appetizers are 99 cents!  The staff is friendly and full of great suggestions.  It can be hard to find...It is on the side of Whole Foods, on the Tatum side of the street."}
{"text":"I just love the food here, I am always impressed. I love the small hole in the wall (clean) family feel. The service is amazing, the food is ALWAYS fresh, and he Saki variety is really good! It's just all around good, but don't pay the outrageous delivery cost ($20) save yourself the money; and just pick-up!"}
{"text":"Their rolls are wicked good and not expensive compared to other sushi places.  You can get a lot of food for two people for $30. The inside is small and crowded.  Nothing fancy but the folks who work there are nice and food is good. I do carry out."}
{"text":"Great little spot to grab some great food! Clean and sterile restaurant. Very friendly waitresses that are accommodating and we'll mannered. Happy customer here,go eat here! It's goooood! Egg rolls are the bomb! Soy soy soy sauce, ya baby mmm..hmmm..I'm coming back jack uhhh ya!"}
{"text":"Interesting place for Sushi. The quality of the sushi was good - and to help out people who might not be that into Japanese cuisine, they offer Chinese as well! Who knew! 

Went here for lunch on a Monday at 12 Noon and zero wait. Food was good and our entire group of five had a good time. 

The Arizona and Phoenix rolls were both great!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the food from today. Yes, I'm aware the food is very cheap and affordable, but the past times I have been here the food has been excellent and delicious for the price. Like a little above average tasting sushi.

Today me and a friend ordered the Spicy tuna, Spicy scallop, spicy salmon and shrimp tempura rolls, and the edamame and gyoza appetizers. 

The only thing that was good was the gyoza, hot and fresh, but the edamame was cold and undercooked.

The spicy salmon roll was below average but ok. And the shrimp tempura rolls was ok, but it was cold, like it has been left out for awhile. Definitely didn't taste fresh at all. We ended up not finishing this roll.

The worst was the spicy scallop and spicy tuna. Both rolls were watery and had a nasty bad fishy taste to them. I can't believe that Iron Chef served us such nasty sushi since they have been nothing but great in the past, but these rolls were unacceptable. Both my friend and I only ate one piece each and refused to eat the rest of those rolls. We both ended up getting food sickness once we got home.

I might've give this restaurant one more chance since they've been great up until now, but it wasn't just one sushi roll that was bad, and raw fish should never have that taste or texture in sushi. Only one appetizer was good, and one sushi roll was average at best."}
{"text":"The place is quaint and the food and service is perfect, Prices are a little high My husband and I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. I wouldn't take an out-of-town guest here, but absolutely perfect for a low key week night date. I do not recommend ordering the nigiri, because the fish was not of the highest quality. But the rolls were great and the beer was cheap :)"}
{"text":"We really like the sushi and they will even make the vegetable chop suey I love!  They have really great specials and the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ohhhh come on!!!! 

I have worked across the street from this place for what seems to be an eternity.  Never even thought about going in.  Never occurred to me, not once.    Our newest favorite sushi place closed, Squid Ink @ Scottsdale/Shea, so we were on the hunt for another place to frequent.  My fiance read the great reviews on Yelp and suggested we try it.   

The first visit, we sat outside and were blown away by the quality and scrumptiousness of the rolls we ordered.  

Since then, we have been ordering take-out almost every Friday for the last... 6 months or more.   We have tried most of their rolls and everything, and I mean everything has been delicious!!

The downsides are the parking lot... a total S%&* Show to get in and out of and the dining room is a bit 'meh', but the quality of the food and the AMAZING customer service FAR outweigh the negatives, so it still gets a 5 star rating from me.

And this Friday,  you can bet that I will be battling for the Take Out parking space out front to get my order!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better tasting sushi places I've eaten at since moving to Arizona. (And I am a sushi snob from the Bay Area). The sushi fish was fresh and there were lots of rolls to choose from at decent prices."}
{"text":"Simply the best all around place for sushi and even for a mixed group of sushi lovers and haters. This is the best reasonably priced sushi I have yet to find. Friends I've taken here who do not like sushi ordered the Chinese menu items and were very satisfied. The Flaming Volcano is a great treat. They also have a good selection of beers and saki. I have yet to have reason to not keep returning for more."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is exceptional! The edamame appetizer is massive! Most important, Try the Super Dragon roll for the best sushi roll of your life!"}
{"text":"Highs and Lows. After the great reviews for Iron Chef, my son, a sushi lover and I came to this Chinese run sushi restaurant. 

Five stars to the service and hospitality. Our server, Cindy was super kind and attentive even though it was busy, she made sure our food came quickly. She filled up our water glasses and was lovely. When we ordered a second round of miso soup and ginger salad for my son, she even brought me a complimentary salad. 

The miso soup was flavorful with konbu seaweed. My son told me he preferred the crunch of nori sprinkled on top, but I thought the deep flavors in the soup was fabulous.

The sashimi and the sushi was fresh and cut well. They were also presented in a lovely way. My son thought that the crab meat in the California roll was a little strong tasting. I just told him that it tasted more authentically like crab unlike most places that served imitation crab meat in their Caifornia rolls.

Their rendition of the volcano roll was fine. We are not really fans of deep fried rolls, but prefer the flame grilled finish ones. However, the flavors were fine.

Why not 4 or 5 stars? The men's bathroom was not clean. My son complained that there was puddle that smelt of urine in the corner. Next, in my complimentary salad, while eating heartily, I bit into something hard. It looked like a piece of raw lobster shell or a spine of a fish fin. But kudos to Cindy, she apologized profusely and took the charge off for the salad and miso soup."}
{"text":"I ONLY have wonderful things to say about this place! I am a college student at ASU and have a huge desire for great sushi at a price that doesn't break the bank! It is worth the drive! They are extremely fast with great customer service more often than not they offer you complementary dishes and each time it might be something new! If you don't eat much of something because you didn't like it they will take it off your tab and you don't even have to ask! The sushi is beyond amazing! I love eel in sushi and they have plenty of great options!"}
{"text":"Tried this place as it was close to the house. Sushi was just OK service was definitely lacking in the freshness and taste. Definitely underwhelming."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is a very good deal with most rolls either 40% or 50% off.
And happy hour is pretty much all day.
They are busy but the service is excellent.
We try to go every month eventhough we live far away"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi and rolls with way too much rice. Lukewarm edamame and so/so sake. Was also given dirty plates, so there's that. Pretty busy though, so they're doing something right:"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend wants Chinese and I'm craving sushi, we hit Iron Chef. He loves their Kung Pao and I've tried and loved almost every sushi roll they offer. The prices are unbeatable, and if you've placed a pick up order, they give you a free drink. It's a small gesture, but indicative of their fantastic customer service. 

Be prepared: about 50% of our take out orders get messed up. But everything is so delicious - we rarely mind."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than five stars. They have great service and are fast at delivering orders. Whatever system they have between the sushi chefs and the kitchen works well. They may speak their native language but they also speak English well which especially in a non Asian state like Arizona, if you don't speak English, then you should not be in the service industry. They have a full staff for the small size of their restaurant and all of them communicate well and work harmoniously together. It's really a great sight to see how well they communicate. Like they are all friends. The food is just fantastic. I've ate a lot of sushi. And these sushi chefs sure know how to make sushi rice and roll a sushi roll correctly. They pack in a decent size of amount of fish and the best part is they know how to pack it in tight!! That means even if you aren't well practiced in chopsticks, you will be able to pick up the largest of rolls without it spilling over. I got the samurai roll which has three different types of fish in it, making it an exceptionally slippery roll and these sushi chefs rolled it so well that even after I bit into the roll it didn't fall apart!!! It's a miracle I tell ya! And even their presentation is nice for the sushi! They are just that good!!  The kitchen food is just as good. My friend ordered kung pao chicken and i don't normally like that dish but the chicken was cooked to the perfect consistency I couldn't help but steal a few pieces for myself. Overall this is one of the best restaurants I have visited. They do everything well."}
{"text":"After eating take away food we had uncomfortable gastrointestinal issues for a couple of days. After reading their health reviews we understand why--

Although he food tastes good the questionable food handling and kitchen procedures will keep us away."}
{"text":"Customer service makes this place too notch! If you're looking for a casual place to get some great sushi (or Chinese food) in the area, this would be the place. They're open late, great prices, excellent selection of rolls and other items. I can come here and order sushi while the people I'm with can order off the Chinese menu. I know this may not be authentic, but it allows for variety when dining with picky eaters.

I had a salmon/tuna/mango roll that was so good - had just enough sweetness with the fruit. Also had a shrimp tempura roll with tuna in soy paper. Interesting combination that was very tasty.

Their happy hour is great and I believe they are open everyday except Christmas (or maybe New Years - can't remember). It's an awesome local place to hang out. Small and casual where they make you feel right at home!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and definitely satisfies a craving for Asian cuisine.  I thought the price was very fair for lunch - we ordered 2 sushi rolls, egg rolls, spring rolls, and 1 lunch special sweet and sour chicken (comes with soup) for take out which cost a very reasonable $25.

The sushi rolls were probably our least favorite part of the meal.  The flavor and taste was fine, but they were a little on the dry side - not sure if that had to do with the fish, the rice, or something else."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. I love their sushi and sashimi and they even have dishes for my girlfriend who's a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Service was not.  Our server didn't seem to want to be at work that day.  We wanted to order additional items but she wouldn't make eye contact. She wouldn't clear the empty serving plates.  She finally brought the bill. We went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers great reviews.  An unexpected gem in the shopping complex.  A simple place that focuses on service and good sushi."}
{"text":"The fish was pretty fresh and the rolls were the perfect size to be able to fit into your mouth without looking like a blowfish... but it was just missing that... something.  We tried a large spread of appetizers, sashimi and rolls...  it was good, but it wasn't great.  I'll only comment on a few of the things we ordered to give the gist:  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  The shrimp on the rainbow roll tasted a little old and chewy.  Most of their rolls with crab have imitation Krab, which they don't tell you, but you can figure it out based upon the prices of the roll that has real crab and specifically states it is real crab.  Our server forgot to bring out miso soup all together, so I don't know how that is.  The crab rangoon was pretty good and had a great sauce.  The yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer missed the mark... I've had it before in other places where it was amazing, so this was a little disappointing.  And the Philly roll had no cucumber and was pretty much all cream cheese, which while I like a good amount, not being able to taste the salmon or anything else isn't appealing.  Some of the pieces of fish were pretty good sized, while others were very lacking - there seemed to be an inconsistency.  If I were in the neighborhood and really hungry for sushi, I might try it again as the prices were pretty decent and they seemed to have a local following, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there for sushi as the experience was a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! $24.95 all you can eat. It is quality roll and great appetizers. Plus $2 beers.  They did not skimp on anything! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi restaurant.  Great vegetarian options. The best seaweed salad I have ever had.  The avacado and cucumber rolls were excellent."}
{"text":"We went to Iron Chef hungry and weee not disappointed by our Happy Hour meal    with each drink we chose one appetizer and my tempura shrimp was the table favorite to go with the mai tai.  The cheerful server was attentive and cheerful.  Our delicious selections were colorful and yummy.  The dragon roll was spectacular and my family raved about the super spicy  ninja roll.  Sitting outside toasting the good life at Iron Chef."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, but was a little disappointed. First off, I didn't like the setup of the restaurant. It seems like more of a takeout place than a sit-down restaurant. We sat at the bar and the service was efficient, if not very friendly. Foodwise, we had the fried calamari, a shrimp tempura sushi roll and a crab avocado roll. The calamari was in large and VERY chewy  pieces...weirded me out a little, but my companion enjoyed it. The mayo-based sauce that came with it  was really good. We both enjoyed the crab avocado roll, and the shrimp tempura roll was lacking a little flavor but still pretty good. Overall the food was ok, but didn't care for the service or the feel of the place. In the future, if I want sushi/Japanese, I'll probably just head up the street to Shogun."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. 

After paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. 

The sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \"spicy\" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. 

I'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner.  The food was very good and the service was friendly and quick!  We sat at one of the ~eight outdoor tables on their cozy heated patio.  We ended up at this sushi restaurant because we used the nearby free electric vehicle chargers and the restaurant reviews are good.  I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Amazing sushi and their sashimi was absolutely the best I've had in awhile. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"the sushi here is probably one of the cheapest prices I've seen in a long time. The quality was pretty good. However, when I go to sushi restaurants, I always pay attention to the rice sushi ratio and Iron chef uses way too much rice and not enough other ingredients. I recommend sashimi style. Overall, it's a good quick easy and cheap sushi place."}
{"text":"Wow the servers run around they r so amazing fast and hard working- and they make the sushi nice and tight w fresh product, great cuts to the fish w respect, beautiful playing, and big portioned rolls. Don't bother w groupon cuz u get a better deal with their 40 and 50% off's & they make more money instead of sharing profits with groupon- I'm curious what happy hour order prices are?... They were already only $6 and $7.  Service of the food was quick and the refills on kiddo soda were always topped off.  Highly recommend the fried rolls and really any of the other rolls were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was very slow both times we went. Next time we will order the food to go."}
{"text":"Great food, great happy hour prices. Every sushi item is half price from 3-5 and 8-10. Plus appetizers are $1 with the purchase of a beer. Not much in the way of ambiance, but not at all shabby. And you really can't complain considering how inexpensive it is. My boyfriend and I stuffed our faces and had 4 rolls, two appetizers, two large beers, and a large sake for about $40."}
{"text":"In-Love! Great service, better food! A ton of menu items to choose from AND they have great happy hour!"}
{"text":"A living social coupon brought me in here this past weekend, but the food will definitely bring me back again. Our coupon was for the sushi menu only, so we got some miso soup and a seaweed salad to start. Miso always tastes the same to me, and this was no different. The salad had a nice flavor and had . But what really impressed us were the two specialty rolls we ordered, the Arizona and the Sunshine. Both were excellent! We were really surprised and pleased that they were so good!

It had been a long and arduous day for the both of us, so we didnt stop with the sushi. We went on to split an order of Mongolian beef. We actually ordered everything at once, so it sounded like a good idea, but ended up being a ton of food. The beef dish was excellent, despite how full we were by the time it arrived. There was just enough spice to the really great sauce. 

The thing I didnt like was the decor. We sat at a patio table that was inside and there was a television directly above my head that was quite distracting. The food and the service made up for it in my opinion. I plan on adding Iron Chef to our rotation of dinner and/or take out spots. I even grabbed a to go menu on the way out!"}
{"text":"LOVE,LOVE,LOVE my IRON CHEF this place is so good my wife and i are here at least 2 times a week we love everything that they serve there, we have been here so many times i think i spent my kids college fund. :D  J.K. I would highly recommend this place to all.   ENJOY"}
{"text":"Incredible sushi. We tried the Ninja jalapeño roll, the dynamite roll, the spicy girl roll and the yum yummy roll and they were all phenomenal. The service was memorable. Overall I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent sushi, food variety, and service. We've been here for early dinners on several occasions, ALWAYS really enjoyed ourselves, had an EXCELLENT sushi as well as the other food items (edamame, soup, et. al.), and have been treated well.  We have fun not only ordering some of the menu items we have had on previous visits, but make it a point to order an item we haven't had before. The servers are enthusiastic, attentive, take special requests (especially condiments), but are not overbearing. By the way, the beer is well chilled and often on special. We are going here tomorrow for an early lunch and will post another review.

As a side note, if I am at a restaurant and the service (or other condition) is in any way imperfect, I request a meeting with an assistant management person to note the deficiency. I DON'T whine about it later! I make a gentle (& respectful) suggestion about improving their restaurant and have found the personnel I talked to generally appreciative."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and had the bento teriaki chicken. It was not good. The salad dressing on the side salad was maybe home made and that was not a good thing. The miso and the california roll were the only pieces of \"food\" that I enjoyed. It was $15 for the bento and not worth it. 

The food is cheap, the egg rolls were from a box of frozen, mass-produced egg rolls and the chicken was warmed in the microwave, cut and then the sauce on top. So disappointing. The place looked cool enough, but with the high prices and cheap food, their time is limited unless they start making some serious changes. Iron Chef...NOT."}
{"text":"In vacationing from NYC. Read the Yelp reviews and waisted a VACA dinner on this  place. Maybe it's great for a take out place But certainly doesn't deserve the rave reviews on Yelp. No...."}
{"text":"Good sushi, broad menu, and excellent happy hour prices.  The service and atmosphere were just so-so.  The hostess led us past several open tables to seat us right near the restrooms.  The waiter left something off of our order and wasn't at all apologetic when we asked about it.  If you're looking for a decent sushi happy hour, Iron Chef will suffice but it probably won't be your new favorite."}
{"text":"Seriously by far my favorite sushi place, the food tastes wonderful. Every sushi place that I try is never as good as this one. I can't find a place that can top this one. My favorite roll is the Tokyo Roll. The prices are awesome too! I highly recommend this place! I am here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Had great deals on sushi all day. Went with my family and we were already planning our next visit. Service felt a bit rushed but she was friendly enough. She was just very busy. Good value and quality food. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place to go whenever I eat out!  Staff is friendly, very generous, and the food is delicious.  Looking for authentic asian food? look no further!!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out, which has been amazing every time! You know how when you take home sushi it sometimes doesn't taste the same? Not with Iron Chef, the quality is great and the rolls stay tightly wound :-) Not a bad experience yet and the staff is always friendly when you arrive, sometimes you get a free sushi roll or beverage!"}
{"text":"This has become our family's go to place for Sushi and fantastic fresh and plentiful Chinese Food, and the Sushi prices are cut in half during their happy hour 11 am to 3 pm ! and again after 8 pm ! what costs us $120.00 at Shogun now is less than $60.00! and the quality is comparable. The Blackberry Jasmin iced tea is my new favorite, we have been at this restaurant once a week for the last month and a half, very friendly and accommodating needs more than five stars...Honest!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and affordable sushi as well as a full kitchen menu.  They have gluten free options too.  The service is great and fast.  The fish is fresh and the sushi options are vast.  The prices are reasonable.  We ordered 8 specialty rolls for a total of $65.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"The sushi at Iron Chef is pretty good (not the best I've ever had but good), but don't go there unless they're doing 50% off happy hour pricing on rolls, or else you will end up overpaying."}
{"text":"While you normally wouldn't think of Iron Chef for catering, ASK THEM ABOUT IT!  They crushed it for a party we had on several levels from the catered Chinese food, the sushi chef knocking out dish after dish and beyond!  When they came back the next day to pick up a tray they had forgotten, they brought over an additional huge tray of Orange Chicken just to be nice.  Eating at the restaurant is always great but if you ever thought about getting Sushi and Chinese for a party, call Iron Chef.  The price and value were beyond expectations."}
{"text":"I highly recommend iron chef. The value is unlike any other sushi is fresh and tasty. I use the sushi as a barometer for all sushi places I visit. The staff is friendly and efficient. It is a must on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"This place is a total scam. I first found this place by way of a groupon. I went at 8pm when all of their sushi rolls are half off with no restrictions unless of course you have a groupon. This clearly was not stated anywhere until of course I got my 40 dollar full price bill for sushi. They said they have a notice posted when you walk in stating the rule for groupons.  Clearly anyone walking in would not see it until the waitress pointed it out. It was a small little piece of paper in the corner of the window in small print. I sucked it up and just paid since I already paid for the groupon and the sushi was decent considering the area is lacking any kind of real sushi joint.

Then I made the mistake of returning again for sushi a 2nd time. Again big sign stating half off all sushi, all day. I ordered three rolls all off the sushi menu with big bold letters stating half off ALL SUSHI ROLLS. When I got the bill the rolls were not half off as stated clearly on the menu. I asked the waitress what the deal was and she, \"oh we just changed it so its only 50% off certain rolls.\". I asked her how anyone would know that , and she just smiled and shrugged her shoulders. Good way to lose customers such as me."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place we get to Tokyo rolled Las Vegas roll the Philadelphia roll the sunset roll the dragon roll the Godzilla roll the miso soup and edamame Oh and last but not least the famous volcano roll that light on fire we go at least once a week for the past year and anytime we go someplace else we are severely disappointed. The prices are unbeatable especially for the premium quality"}
{"text":"Such a ripoff. The dine in sushi during lunch time are the smallest little rolls you have ever seen. I got volcano roll that said 8 but came 6. I was told if it was the 8 as stated they would be skinner. I was dumbfounded. I had to update my review because I couldn't believe it. I will give it to them the 30 percent off price but you literally get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Great sushi, even better prices. Always good service especially with kids. The waitresses always give my kid different food to try. It's always happy hour there."}
{"text":"Iron Chef has the most inexpensive sushi and it's awesome!  Don't be fooled by the menu's high prices.  Everything is at least half off with their happy hour specials that run all the time.  Their hot and spicy soup is amazing and everyone that works there is really nice."}
{"text":"Delicious & super reasonable. Pretty fast service as well. I always have a good experience at the Iron Chef!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Scottsdale/PV and we eat here weekly. The food is great, we mostly just have sushi but the chow main is also great and they have the best Orange chicken. Staff is very friendly and the prices are amazingly great! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I finally went to try out the new neighborhood sushi joint.  I had lunch at Iron Chef and must say that it was simply a delicious lunch done right!  I tried an assortment of sushi and sashimi including the surf clam (which is always a great way to measure freshness), the shrimp tempura sashimi, eel , shrimp and salmon.  

The fish is fresh and prepared with a modern twist.  The entire lunch was provided to me on one large plate which made it easier to eat, as well as simpler to sample each variety of sushi without having to move plates around the table. 

The interior was carried over from Pick Up Stix, the previous tenant - it a small dining area without too much room to dine.  I was able to eat outside which I prefer until the heat comes scorching in.

The service is good, not great.  Expect to wait for at least 15 minutes for your food.  However, it is worth the wait. 

Iron Chef also offers an all you can eat sushi buffet, half off happy hour and a Chinese menu.

A great option for most any time."}
{"text":"The service here was outstanding.  It was a younger lady that was serving my mother and i and she was great!!!!  She made our lunch better than any server ive ever had! We went for happy hour and most items, 80% of the sushi was 40-50% off, NICE! The food was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"Such a great deal on sushi here! The staff is super friendly! It is a very small restaurant, so it's not good for large groups - which is why we order out. We've tried their chicken teriyaki but it's terrible. Stick to getting the sushi, that's what they do the best."}
{"text":"The dirtiest restaurant ever. This is the closest sushi place to our house. Despite the mixed reviews here, we decided to give it a shot. We we went at around 8pm. As said in previous reviews, the restaurant was FILTHY. None of the tables were bused and someone had spilled a whole plate of sushi on the floor. The waitress apologized for the mess. We sat at the only unoccupied cleanish table and ordered tea. Soon we realized that no one was cleaning up the mess!!! The manager, who looked semi-homeless in his backwards baseball cap sat right next to the mess and counted money with his calculator, right there in the open.The waitress walked by all the disgusting tables empty-handed time after time. Eventually, she brought out a broom and dustpan and placed it next to the mess on the floor, but never cleaned it! We debated whether to leave, but ordered some sushi to see if anyone would clean anything before we left. Nope. Manager finished counting money and watching a playoff game and walked out. This disastrous excuse for a restaurant looked the same as the minute we walked in! I posted a couple of pics of this.

It's too bad because the tea and sushi were okay, but I felt like I was eating in a garbage dump."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. Not sure why it took us so long to get here!  So friendly, the food came out fast it was a great experience all around.  It is busy, but they are super efficient.  

The food is very good and care is taken to prepare the dishes with quality ingredients even though they bust out your food fast.  It's going to become our go to Chinese and sushi."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  I've come back many times and every time it's great quality and Bella is a fantastic server.  If you're looking for good sushi in the area, go here."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a quick sushi place and wasn't expecting much, but WOW!   The sushi was amazing.  I'm a huge fan of Hiro and think it's the best around.  Iron chef isn't far off and the pricing is almost too good to be true.  Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. Amazing food, friendly and attentive staff. The all you can eat sushi is a wonderful deal!"}
{"text":"Just a quick update, I popped in the other day to Iron Chef for Happy Hour and found out that they are running Half off All Rolls from now until October! If you are on the fence about trying this great place now is the perfect time!!"}
{"text":"Wow, surprised by the previous reviews, and I'm glad I didn't read them before going.  

I was driving by and was starved so stopped here for a quick lunch.  I'm currently trying the no/low-carb thing so I ordered their sashimi lunch combo, which was supposed to be 9 pcs of sashimi plus a CA roll.  I asked if they could sub 2 more pcs of sashimi instead of the roll and they had no problem with it.

The fish was fresh and tasty.  The miso soup it came with was also good.  The ice tea I had was good as well.

All in all, a great stop, and I would come again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"This place has amazing deals! They have happy hour daily from 3-5 pm AND again from 8-10pm! The lunch specials here are from 11-2pm. I love the #5 sushi roll bento. It comes with soup, salad, spring roll, crab rangoon, California roll (the water of sushi) and you get to choose any two rolls from their Roll, Hand Roll, and Vegetarian Roll sushi menu - all for $10! That's a lot of frickin' food! Side note: all their Bento's are ten bucks.

Service, again, was great. I noticed they got some new tables and chairs (although I did see a few of the old Pick Up Stix ones) and there are two large TV's to entertain you if your company is boring ;)"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. They're happy hour is excellent value. The owner so nice to come out and talk to you and prepare any dish you want."}
{"text":"We love this place like crazy. Where can you get 4 sushi rolls and 3 drinks for $32?!? Nowhere. Also sometimes they give you free food because they are super nice. The service can seem a little rushed but it's because normally they are really busy. You get your money's worth at Iron Chef, the value is unreal."}
{"text":"Iron Chef remains #1 on my sushi joint list.  Amazing food, amazing service, and unbeatable prices!  I would recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by and wish I kept on going. The food was bland and so was the service. Had the Kung pao chicken and it didn't taste like anything. There were also only 2 other tables but took 15 minutes for someone to take our order. Did not try the sushi but won't be back to give it a shot."}
{"text":"So far my favorite place for sushi! We always do take out every roll is delish and amazing! Constant every time no additional charges for take out. Always nice great service with a smile and a product to back it up."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been spoiled by the AYCE options in California. Arizona just doesn't really have much to offer. 

Anyway, the people in my party were wanting AYCE and so they had to call this place to make sure they offered it and they said they do. They gave the wrong price over the phone though. The man on the phone said $21. When we arrived they only gave us the regular menu and we had to specifically request the AYCE menu. The menu said the price was actually $24.95. The menu is VERY limited as well as you can see by the photo. 

Food was just OK. Nothing special. The sashimi was very warm. Gyoza was probably the best tasting item we got. Crab ragoons were another good item on the menu. The regular rolls were very tiny and the specialty rolls are the better option if sushi rolls are what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only take out. Their sushi is okay. If you've never had sushi that wasn't store bought before, this place is really good. It probably ranks at the bottom for me as far as sushi places are concerned. 

They have this one delivery guy that is incredibly rude. He only gives you like 2.5 seconds to answer the door before knocking again. He is Very impatient and just shoves the food in your face. Watches you write your tip and if you don't tip him good enough he doesn't even say bye."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi! It's always 40% to 50% off and the people are super friendly! Every time I go there, everyone is always smiling. It's surprising how much just a simple thing can positively affect your experience. I would definitely recommend this place, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has a great sushi happy hour. The sushi is good. And they also have a great selection of Chinese and Japanese food. I eat here at least twice a month, the staff is always friendly and knows exactly what I order (every time). Great prices."}
{"text":"Our favorite Asian fusion place! My fiancé can enjoy the general tso's chicken and I can get sushi! We love the miso soup!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times with various groups of people. Every experience has been 4-5 stars. Staff are friendly and the food is really good. Coming from a part of SoCal that has well above average Sushi I'd say this place is at least on par and towards the better side of things. The Chinese portion of the menu is among the best I've had. Super tasty. They also have good drink specials. The $6 Sake Bomber comes with plenty of warm sake and a big beer that was enough to get us all sufficiently primed before the meal arrived. Atmosphere is good too. Great place."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch last Friday.  Seemed like a pretty busy place for lunch. Service was quick but not refined.  I was offered a seat anywhere so I sat outside.  Order was taken quickly . I ordered the Arizona roll with a 40% discount it came to 9.75. The sushi was ok but nothing special. There was very little filling with a deep fried shrimp.  I haven't eaten out much in Phoenix yet I was definitely not impressed enough to want to come back. Meal was presented nicely though"}
{"text":"Soft shell crab appetizer is so good.  The jalapeño yellowtail app was barely anything at all. The tuna tataki  was just the seared fish, not like what Ive had at other places. The Panda roll was fantastic. Service is always good. Sat outside, perfect weather, but they need to get cushions for the iron chairs outside."}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent. It's usually not good. My cucumber salad was over soaked in dressing and it was mushy like they had prepared it yesterday. It's always hit and miss... I don't plan to come back. There's also one waitress who always looks like she doesn't like anyone! I don' recommend it."}
{"text":"We ate there last night and today my wife and I are sick throwing up and diarrhea. This place should not even be open look at its health inspections!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Iron Chef for father's day.  We had a really great experience.  The restaurant is small and had a very \"mom and pop\" feeling to it which we all liked. We got to the restaurant after happy hour and they still honored the happy hour prices for us! Perhaps it was because they weren't busy when we walked in.  My father in law mentioned to the waitress that he really like getting the sushi served \"on a boat\" and the waitress made sure to bring us 2 boats that were decorated and presented beautifully.  The sushi itself was very fresh and delicious. The green tea fried ice cream was also great. We've paid  double for sushi at other restaurants that was not as good as this.  One person in our party had a Chinese dish and that also was good.  We will definitely be back.  The happy hour specials are the best in the area."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for dinner on a Saturday night and so happy we did. We grabbed a seat on the patio since it was nice outside and were brought some menus and waters. We noticed they have 35% and 40% off many rolls. We had the Yummy, Yummy Roll, Birds of Paradise Roll, Super Volcano Roll and a Salmon Hand Roll. Our favorite was the Birds of Paradise Roll but everything we had was very good. There are a ton of options as well. 

I had accidentally ordered a baked salmon skin hand roll instead of just a salmon and cucumber hand roll and they corrected it with no questions asked! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour prices.  $5 for a sake bomber, what that is nuts, getting tipsy thinking about it.  Their sushi is better than most in the valley.  If you can sit outside as it gets a little cramped inside.  The Chinese is good as well, I usually get the Mongolian beef.  If we lived closer we would go here over Kona."}
{"text":"3 stars for the sushi. But won't be returning after we thought we finally found our favorite sushi place.  We went yesterday for lunch we asked for a high chair and expected that she would get it for us. But she decided to go eat in her little corner by the bathroom instead of help us.  When our food was ready she would place it in front of our 2 year old who will grab not knowing if it'll be hot or not. She was not friendly. When she brought us our rolls she would say what it was,  but we could not understand what she would mumble and say quietly. Great job to great food,  but some of your staff need evaluation on their poor services"}
{"text":"This place made me happy. As my first time there, they comp-ed one of my rolls. The server was amazing too, very attentive and sweet. I ordered a few rolls, some sake and a \"side order\" of chicken chow mein for my kiddo. The side dish was enough to feed 2 kids and the rolls were very tasty. They get an A+ for presentation. One of the rolls that came out was beautifully lined on a bowl and the center was lit on fire right before our eyes. To top it off, they are so incredibly reasonable. Would be a shame NOT to come here with all these goodies. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a great little gem in this area!!! I am so excited that it is near my house and they also deliver! You can get sushi and chinese!! Whatever you are feeling. The rolls are always fresh and tasty and their 1/2 price sushi deal is amazing."}
{"text":"Love their sushi ,always fresh , friendly staff great prices.
Never seen before sushi 40% off and still good quality"}
{"text":"Generally good food and quick friendly service. Some of the items I have had have a tad too much oil and could use a bit more spice hence the one star downgrade.  I will keep going."}
{"text":"This place is great for a number of reasons, but what I love the most is how quick and easy it is to order the food. Let's paint the picture: it's a Friday night and I don't feel like cooking since  I'd rather play with my super cute daughter... so, I go to their website, order WAY too much sushi, sashimi and of course miso soup. Then, I get a big cheesy smile on my face when I see how cheap my total order is. I receive an email letting me know my order is ready and my husband will stop by on his way home and pick up our dinner. Everything comes packaged neatly (nothing like how take-out usually looks) and of course the food is yummy and I don't have to wash dishes at the end!!"}
{"text":"I do recommend this place. Good place to hang out with friends and drink. Their Sushi are pretty good and fresh. Good service also!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were aimlessly driving around looking for a place for happy hour. Luckily, we came across this gem. The happy hour prices were amazing---you could get an appetizer for a mere $2 when you ordered a drink. I ordered the Mai Thai for $2.95. What a steal! I also ordered the Singapore noodles, which were mouth-watering. My friend enjoyed the half-off sushi deals and the sake bombs. I definitely plan on coming back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We visited Iron Chef on a friend's recommendation. Once there, we looked up the reviews on Yelp, and I became concerned. However, I was happily relieved when our food was presented. My daughter and I ordered Sushi on happy hour. It was delicious and fresh and nicely priced. My husband ordered chicken and broccoli, with a custom spiced-up szechuan sauce that was fabulous. We also split spring rolls and tempura - also quite good. We will gladly come back to visit. :-)"}
{"text":"Great little place!!! Nice people, food is excellent, prices are always affordable!! 

Great happy hour and nice patio"}
{"text":"Allez Cuisine! That sounds about right.

This place serves fusion food and sushi. Our local tour guide brought us here.

The sushi that contained fruit was unique and was kind of like eating poke bowls, only in a roll instead of a bowl. Only I don't normally taste banana in it, so it's different. It came out slightly slowly but that's the price of good food.

They paid for it, so the price was not an issue, but it was slow food so a tip was required.

I think it was a good experience, so I'll raise my rating."}
{"text":"So I'm not a sushi connoisseur or anything (I know a good spicy tuna roll and that's about it), but both the spicy tuna roll and the spicy yellowtail roll were amazing here. My fiance had the sashimi plate, and since we rolled in at 8:05 pm, that thing was $12 dollars! He said it was great, my food was great and for two rolls and a sashimi plate, we paid $27 bucks. A steal. The service was good, the place was chill, the food exceeded my expectations. I'd absolutely go back."}
{"text":"My friend and I always go to Iron Chef for sushi, the sushi is great and so are the prices. Every time we've been there the service is good and everyone's very attentive but this time it was horrible. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and we sat down and they gave us menus but no plates or silverware. Servers would pass by and not say anything until finally I flagged someone done and got our order in after about 10 min. We get our food but still no plates or silverware, my friend had to get up and get it himself. They didn't ask if we needed anything, I always had to flag someone down and ask, only refill our teas every so often. I love the sushi here but I'm sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Iron Chef! We live down the street, and with prices this good, we're there almost every week. It's small, and the decor is nothing to write home about, but the half-price sushi is phenomenal, and there's a lot of variety! The staff is always really pleasant. I think they've memorized our order and definitely know us."}
{"text":"Great place I would highly recommend. Good for families couples and anyone who likes good sushi, super fresh and great service this was our first visit and if the were closer to our house we'd have to find another job to support our eating habits lol and they have clean restrooms a bonus for anyone who also works in the food industry."}
{"text":"pretty solid, as for some reason, between holding my Living Social voucher and the somewhat-obscure reputation, I may have set the bar lower than I needed to.  2 of the 3 rolls were excellent, the one that was not (spicy tuna?) was pretty fishy.  To the staff's credit, they gratefully replaced it.

And, their wine list, while short, is very reasonably priced.  Will return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. There was only another table occupied. It smelled strongly of old fried food. Ordered some rolls and a miso soup. The soup was warm not hot, the rolls were just ok. Service was good. Not a place that I'll get out of my way to go. *2.5*"}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. Service was incredible . Atmosphere was pleasant. The California rolls were very good. The rice is is perfect. The rolls keep there shape and don't fall apart easily. They price is not steep whatsoever 11 outta 10. Thank you iron chef for a phenomenal experience!"}
{"text":"Iron chef, we love you!! We can get san francisco quality sushi any time or pick up some delish chinese to go.  I am soooo picky, and I really love their food. Iron Chef, stay awesome!"}
{"text":"Just arrived to AZ craving Sushi the fish is fresh the staff was Sooo nice and welcoming. The sign on the wall says \"quality is always in style\". My wife is pregnant they made cooked rolls for her no mayo, no spicy, cut using a  knife that was not used on fresh fish. 

You can pay more for amazing Sushi but you can't guarantee great service with a smile:)"}
{"text":"This place Blows.  (with a capital 'B')

The food that was supposed to be served hot arrived at our table cold (very cold).

Our table was dirty and from my seat looking at the kitchen, it didn't appear too tidy either.

The service here was so poor that we simply left the restaurant and paid for only the drinks we had ordered.

Wanna be ignored? 
Looking for an absent waiter and arrogant host? 
Looking for a less than clean dining enviroment?  

Then look no further.

They might have 'great deals' on food..... if you consider awful service, nasty dining conditions and food that would be below par even in a federal prison a great deal."}
{"text":"service wasn't good and the sushi was just OK. won't go back."}
{"text":"Scrumdiddlyumptious!

Priced exceptionally well (we enjoyed their happy hour prices and 40% off roll deal), Iron Chef delivers deliciousness with every plate! Not only as everything freshly made to order and tasty, but the presentation was impressive!

There were four of us out together - two of us enjoyed Mai Tais, and myself and my boyfriend ordered the \"sake and Sapporo special\". This was a 600ML bottle and a whole craft of sake for only $6!!

Our service was quick, and dishes were promptly cleared as we finished each dish. Everyone around the table had their personal favourite, but I would HIGHLY recommend the ninja jalapeño. This dish knocked it out of the park. 

I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This was my first time actually sitting and eating at the restaurant, came in for a birthday dinner. Even on a Wednesday nice to see this little Chinese/Japanes sushi spot filled with customers! From the start our server was outstanding with our group of 10 and attentive to our needs. I recommend the won ton egg drop soup as starter! The main meal consisted of  a plate of salmon avocado roll, scallion yellowtail roll and spicy shrimp avocado roll. The rolls were very tasty and fresh! If you don't know me by now I am a huge ice tea enthusiast and the unsweet ice tea had a hint of green tea which I like! I will be back for sure and excited to try the sushi menu!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile ever since we have been going to Jasmine Tokyo but my friend and I were in the neighborhood so we stopped in for lunch.
Happy to write that cozy, friendly feel is still there and the hour and a half we were there for lunch there was a lot of foot traffic of people coming and going for lunch. 
They still have their Chinese menu, 40-50% off different rolls and all you can eat sushi for $24.95. 
Still a great neighborhood spot and great for a quick lunch. 
Of course . . . the only sushi place my son will ask for by name is Jasmine Tokyo . . . but I still like this place!"}
{"text":"Iron chef is that secret hole in the wall restaurant that you don't tell people about because you don't want it to get any busier. Eating sushi for me is usually a choice of either good quality or reasonable prices. That is not the case at iron chef, if you know what to order the quality is excellent and the prices are unbelievably cheap if you are dining in. This is my go-to sushi restaurant and will always be, highly recommend I would give it 6 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants. Their sushi is very fresh and a lot better than some other sushi places I've been to. Their bento boxes are my favorite thing to pick as they have some very good variety of sushi and sashimi to choose from."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a couple years now. Great service, laid back neighborhood feel after a busy day or chill date night, and the food is always delicious!! And all day happy hour =D $40 for two specialty rolls, large Kieran and saki, tempura sweet potatoes, and backed muscles. Highly recommend the yummy yummy roll! Can't beat the quality for the price!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is my favorite sushi place and it is so close to my home! Before having a baby we came here at least 4 times a week! Now that we have a baby we only make it out 1-2 times a week! But I LOVE this place! 
The rolls are a wonderful price and the fish is SO fresh! 
It is a very laid back restaurant with wonderful deals! We even started getting take out and it is still just as great eating it at home! 
The staff is so friendly and they always remember us, which is great to feel so welcomed! 
It you are looking for a fun, easy going place to grab some good sushi, this is the place for you! 
I'm currently pregnant so it has made it really hard to get sushi, but I can't wait to go back once I have my little girl!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times since its not too far from me. However, being served some very old, if not spoiled cucumbers in both sushi rolls we got we will not be returning. Although, I will mention the service was slightly better this time around as opposed to other times. I'd honestly say don't waste your time on the lower end of mediocre. If you want cheaper sushi visit sushi station."}
{"text":"I came back to this place for my Brothers Birthday and it was another great experience. Friendly staff and sushi was awesome. We got there at 5:02pm and missed the happy hour but they still gave us Happy Hour Prices. This is the type of customer service that got a much larger tip and me coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot. Good pricing and nice selection, hard to find the two in combination in the valley. Additionally, the staff was super friendly and always there to refill our drinks. We will definitely be going back when in the area, as we often crave sushi and miss having it everywhere (from Southern California)."}
{"text":"I'm sharing my review because this restaurant has been in my life for a long time. My husband and i have been coming here for years now, pretty much since it opened. Im really not sure where any of the negative comments are coming from, because we have always been treated like family there!! The food is amazing, and more than worth the price; we make sure to always leave a great tip for our waitress who remembers us and greets us with warmth every time we come. No matter what time of day we happen to drop in, everyone is super professional and the food is always great. Most importantly, everyone i have recommended this place to has been equally happy, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I love this place me and my family eat here at least twice a month. My favorite is the Tiffany roll, Salmon hand rolls and Philadelphia roll, my new favorite is the tootsie roll and there price are great with 35% to 40% off on the rolls"}
{"text":"We came during lunch and was surprised at their extensive menu of Chinese and Japanese items. The restaurant is small and welcoming. We sat close to the back of the restaurant and was given a menu with lunch special items and a paper with sushi items - tons of different sushi items at 40% off. 

We decided to order the Sunshine roll, Phoenix roll and Tempura Shrimp roll and everything was fresh and tasty. Our server was really friendly and our bill came to around $25- pretty inexpensive compared to other sushi spots. Overall, we liked the sushi, the service, the restaurant and the prices so we will be back. They are also open during the holidays too - even on Christmas!"}
{"text":"Back at Iron Chef for some sushi.  Got a Groupon and seriously I thought this was another sushi house.  My mistake but the food was solid.  Service was pleasant and quick.  Started with our miso soup full of tofu.  It was salty (as expected) but good.  Next was the cucumber salad.  The flavor was good but the cukes  were swimming in all the rice vinegar.  It could have been better if the cukes were julienned rather than sliced.  Our sushi came out before the edamame.  We got the salmon roll and our specialty roll was salmon, tuna, & white fish.  Tasty and fresh.  The way they broke down the bill was odd.  Usually they show what you owe but in this case, they had all the prices of the sushi along with the total.  It was confusing leading my husband to question what the tip should be.  Just the bottom line total would be better folks.  Plenty of parking.  Sorry the photos are red, their lighting has a lot to do with it."}
{"text":"We went for the happy hour that everyone raved about and missed it by 6 minutes. The times were not listed on the website so we were guessing. FYI, it's daily 3-5pm and 8-10pm. We ended up staying and everything was delicious. Our favorite was the Phoenix roll. Possibly one of the best rolls I have ever had. We also had the Fuji Mountain. It was very good. We spent way more than we had planned but it was worth the trip and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great service and fine tasting sushi.  The prices are inline with a typical sushi place, the initial prices are high but when you factor in the 30-40% off it all equals out."}
{"text":"Wow! All I can say is wow as I walk out of this fabulous sushi place! Thanks to Yelp, we discovered this little gem that has become our favorite sushi place in Arizona! We had 4 rolls and they were all incredible! The miso soup was top notch. They were super busy but the service was still outstanding! We will be back asap and will highly recommend to everyone we know!  Don't miss the opportunity to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm delicious!!! Tofu broccoli so fresh in a garlic sauce. Been coming here for about 2 years, always such great service and food!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place earlier ! I usually go 2x a week, having been to many different sushi places around AZ this is by far my favorite place, The lady that takes our order is so sweet and nice and friendly, our food is always amazing !"}
{"text":"Love their kindness before anything. Ive been here about 5 times now, and they remember me by my face. Its something I appreciate more than anything.
Besides the welcoming feeling, their food always have 50% discounts. I actually have no idea if its all day long or just during lunch time because I come in during lunch. But their deals are great! I try to taste different kinds of rolls everytime time I visit. But i can never say no to the Dragon Roll! Its amazing and tasty! 
I recommend this place! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to come and eat and spending with your loved one .
Food is Amazingly delicious 
The service is Great.."}
{"text":"This is a small place that is usually understaffed but they have excellent food. The prices are the best I've seen too."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much, but man... this place has amazing food!

The service was quite nice, but I was there in an early afternoon and there were only like 3 other tables.   There were people running in for take-out orders, which was a good sign.

We ordered 4 different dishes and they were all amazing.  I love that this place delivers!  Can't wait for a Friday night in with the hubby to snuggle up with some sushi!"}
{"text":"Went here on a late night whim craving AYCE sushi.  It was a weeknight so not too busy.  I've been here before when it was crazy busy and had to sit outside in the way too hot summer of Phoenix.  Sushi doesn't sit well in those conditions.  Inside, it was nice and quiet.  Service was great.  AYCE priced a bit high but given that they include Sashimi, I think it's reasonable.  They limit you to 12 pieces of sashimi so if you are a fan and want your money's worth, start with that.  Nigiri was also good.  Quality of the fish and thickness of the sashimi was on point.  Nothing fishy or smelly.  

I also got a Dynamite roll as I'm a sucker for the baked scallops in mayo.  The roll underneath was quite heavy and unfortunately took up a lot of stomach space, so I'd go with someone and share it if you can.

Finished with dessert- green tea ice cream.  I'm expecting a tiny scoop of ice cream and they come up with like 3 gigantic scoops.  It was amazing but struggled to fit it all in.

I think I calculated the price of my meal to be over $60, so I think I ate my money's worth.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"It was better deal than groupon. Price was good and taste was pretty good as that price. Portion wasn't that a lot but it was good enough for that. If you are looking for cheap and tasty sushi roll, then go ahead \"iron chef\"."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and I was craving spice- so I got the Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy California Roll and some Miso Soup. 

The wasabi was not actual wasabi and it was not hot at all with its blan flavor. 

The miso soup was awful, and probably the worst I've ever had. The hand roll was ok, but the seaweed it was wrapped in was soggy and gross, so I had to eat everything out of it was a fork. The Tuna roll was also just OK and seemed as little soggy and old rather than crispy. It did have spice to it, but with the sogginess I still couldn't really eat it. Everything was just a mess and I was so disappointed that I spent $25 on food that i ended up not enjoying so I didn't eat it. I would not go back for a second chance despite the reviews."}
{"text":"Very nice and pleasant service. Sushi is very good especially within the prices they charge."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was horrible. The waitress was too busy to serve my table. I asked three different waiters for items because she was not coming to my table. 

When it was time to pay I showed my Groupon and they would not honor it. They said some of the sushi I had was half price and they would not honor it. In fact I bought $20 worth of sushi that was not half off. 

She got the manager and we go through the same argument. In fact it does not even mention it on the Groupon. So he points me to some handwritten signs posted in the restaurant. I felt they were unfair with their Groupon and the service alone should have honored the discount. 

I would have given them 1 star but I had to give them credit for the quality of the food. 

I'm going to post their Groupon disclosure about their half off sushi. Note. If you serve a special all day it's not happy hour."}
{"text":"Passed by it on Monday & wanted to try it the next time I was craving Asian food. 

Today was looking for somewhere to eat for lunch & noticed this on Google Maps & remembered I wanted to try it. Went to their website to see their menu & they had a wide variety of chinese & japanese food. You can even order online & even have it delivered if its after a certain time. Decided to go there & get the food to go. Took 10mins or less to have my order ready.

Ordered their lunch chicken chow mein combo which comes with chicken fried rice & 1 eggroll & 1 crab rangoon along with the chicken chow mein.

The chow mein was excellent! They didn't put to many veggies or other weird items like some other chinese places do. Fried rice was a bit bland but when eaten with the other food it made up for the bland taste.

Eggroll was delicious as well. Looks to be a veggie roll which I don't typically like but it reminds me of Yogis Grill eggrolls which are very similar & delicious as well."}
{"text":"It's basically always happy hour. I'm not super adventurous when it comes to sushi, but everything I've tried is delicious. This place taught my skeptical mother that sushi can be good."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. It doesn't taste too fresh. I guess you get what you pay for. The 40% off all day turned out to be not a great deal. The service was good. Very nice waitresses."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister on a Friday evening, it was pretty packed but we were seated within 5 minutes. We ordered gyoza and calamari. The gyoza was delicious and would definitely order again! The calamari was disappointing. I am used to smaller pieces but they served about five massive pieces of squid. It was so chewy that by the time I got through the squid, all the breading fell off. I would not recommend. We each ordered a few rolls, the sashimi is great. I was not impressed with the fried rolls, the rice became dense and dry in the fried rolls and I have had better elsewhere. The other rolls, chef's specials were delicious! I will most likely be back due to their outrageously good prices, but will choose my rolls more wisely."}
{"text":"Poor quality fish, small quantity. Made me wish I had picked up sushi at the Whole Foods or Frys instead - where it is vastly better. Even with the happy hour prices that fish is overpriced."}
{"text":"Incredible waste of money. Dishonest restaurant. My pu pu platter had no crab rangoon.  Ordered handrolls, received regular roll. Ordered egg foo young. According to menu \"served with gravy & rice.\" Take-out order, no gravy included. I called to ask about gravy. They said when they print \"gravy\" it means \"brown sauce.\" It was as dry as hell, no moisture. They said it was \"baked in sauce.\" Nonsense. It was inedible. They just lied about forgetting gravy. Egg foo young wo/gravy is like shrimp alfredo wo/cheese.

This is my 2nd review. My 1st was a 5 star review of another restaurant. I just felt compelled to write because of this awful service. Will be my last visit to Iron Chef, previously their sushi was ok, but their Chinese food was subpar."}
{"text":"Tiny place with great value. I will definitely return!  Food and service were excellent. Very casual and a bit noisy but it works. Good prices on happy hour."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since it was a different restaurant. 
Can't remember the name 

But tonight was very good, we will be back. Am really happy because I haven't had roast pork fried rice that good in a very long time. 
It was a side dish and worth every penny. I could eat that alone for dinner. 

We had the schezuan shrimp, medium spicy, was perfect. 
I asked for no bell peppers and they didn't disappoint. I'm just not a big fan of cooked celery either but it's a common vegetable in Chinese food. Plenty of broccoli. Yummy.. 

Also had the Mongolian beef. Tender slices of beef, not chewy, cooked well, good sauce. Lots of flavor. No extra charge for brown rice. 

In looking at the sushi rolls sitting on the sushi bar, nice size rolls. Not those little skimpy ones that you find. Menu is very varied, we will return. 
Prices are good and appropriate. 
2 entrees that come with brown rice, one side of roast pork fried rice, and we have leftovers, $31.00

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a bunch of friends. After 8pm sushi is 1/2 off. Also, buy a beer or saki and your appetizer is 1/2 off too!

Sushi was very fresh and tasty. The three of us had a variety of rolls and every one of them was great. Too many to name.

I'll be going back again!"}
{"text":"Some of us from work have been coming here a few times at lunch. The great half-off rolls price is a good inducement, but the saki is better than most and the rolls all taste fresh and delicious. 

Iron Chef servers are impossibly cute, and they bring lots of ginger and wasabi to match your rolls. I had the veggie tempura box first time out and that was great. Great lunch, friendly, quick service, all for under a tenner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place does not have at least 4 stars??? Staff is amazing and sushi is the best I had for the best price!!! Ill never eat sushi anywhere else!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Half of the servers are wonderful, the other half leave you on the patio, dont bring silverware, dont bring menus, and don't bring water. Theres one server who was on his cell phone the entire time, and luckily the lady inside helped us. Terrible. The food itself was good, but nothing to write home about. Typical sushi. Service really threw me off. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Love everything about this local sushi shop. Everyone is extremely friendly and committed to making the visit excellent. There are usually a lot of staff working at any given time, so server attention and speed of the food is unparalleled. I always go here for the happy hour (50% off rolls ((unlimited!)) ) They also have great mixed drink/beer specials during happy hour. Food always tastes very fresh, and you can tell the chefs put a lot of care in to the creation and presentation. Parking is a little light during the tail end of happy hour, but if that's my biggest qualm, consider me a big fan. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great prices. This is my go to place for sushi with my best friend, especially because it's nice and easy on our wallets and the quality is certainly not the worst I've ever had. There are definitely other places in the area which serve higher quality fish, but unless you are a sushi snob, you likely won't be disappointed in the flavors and quality. They also have a lot of fun combos. I never thought I would enjoy salmon + mango, but it's really nice! Also, bowls that are on fire usually serves for fun conversations with nearby diners. 

Con: slow service. I will admit, I've waited a bit for service and food. However, I don't necessarily mind. My friend and I are always in good conversation and so we don't push for immediate service. Enjoy the social hour and fun food!"}
{"text":"The sushi was alright.  I had cali and spicy tuna roll.  The service however was terrible.  We literally had to trip an employee that was close.  The good thing was the price was reflective of the food."}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in AZ, the presentation was spectacular and the food was awesome! We had the Phoenix roll, crazy salmon roll and the golden dragon roll and they were all amazing.I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi served at a fair price, lots of options here for non-sushi eaters. Food was decent, nothing exceptional, seems like a good place to have a few drinks as they have lots of specials."}
{"text":"We had the house fried rice, egg rolls, sashimi, and sushi rolls. Everything came out so fast and everything was fresh! Such good food, staff, and atmosphere. Bonus- our kids loved their teriyaki chicken! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice now and will definitely make the 20 minute drive to come again! All the sushi is fresh and 40-50% off all the time. The alcohol is also incredibly cheap- $4 for glass of wine and cheap sake bombs. We liked the Ninja Roll a lot. There is a ton on the menu and a wide variety of rolls. The service is fast and attentive. For the price, it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I ordered this through Postmates so I'm not sure what the actual restaurant is like. The sushi was awesome. I got the fried shrimp roll and it was delicious. However I got the beef udon bowl and that was not good at all. The beef was steamed and had very little flavor and the overall dish was just not very impressive. I ended only eating the sushi and maybe one or two bites of the udon. I might be willing to give it another try but not the best Asian experience I've had"}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent.  Service was great.  Insane happy hour specials.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for about a year now and I would say I've dined in some 20+ times. Of those I've had 3 experiences that would have turned me away had they been my first time, two of which I was introducing some friends to this restaurant I talk nonstop about. I could sit here and complain but it comes down to this: inconsistent quality. The service and atmosphere are always 5/5 however I always have to second guess what I order for fear that it won't be as good as the last time I had it. I've noticed a change in the servers over a year but I unfortunately never got to meet the chef's so I can't say for sure if they've changed too."}
{"text":"The place is small and still has the old tables and chairs from when it used to be Pick Up Stix, which doesn't bother me but irked my friend. Their wine and beer prices were super cheap, but would have been even cheaper if we weren't using the coupon (can't be used in conjunction with their awesome happy hour prices). We ordered the spicy tuna, Philadelphia, Tiffany, Phoenix, spicy salmon, and Arizona rolls. Our waiter informed us that appetizers are 99 cents if you order a roll, so we got an order of edamame, gyoza, spring rolls, and crab puffs. He walked away and I immediately began freaking about how tiny my stomach is versus the amount of food we just ordered. I figured I should maybe stop drinking my wine to save room for the sushi. Spoiler alert: I didn't.

Our appetizers came out and they were small and standard tasting, which we were okay with since they weren't even a dollar each. But our sushi came out and WOAH. Looking delicious atop a large bridge with a glowing plastic ice cube in the middle, I could barely get a picture before we started in on it all. The fish tasted fresh and, even more importantly, I could actually taste the fish. I can't tell you how many times I've gone places that do a Philly roll with a little bit of salmon and a LOT of cucumber and cream cheese. Iron Chef did not disappoint. The flavors complimented each other nicely in their Phoenix, Tiffany, and Arizona rolls especially. 

We did note that their wasabi really lacked the normal spiciness. My friend spent so long adding more and more wasabi to his soy sauce, trying to get to his normal heat, that I nearly Hoovered all his rolls. 

In the end, when the others gave up on their sushi, I finished it. All. Next time, we're coming back during happy hour. I want more of that Tiffany roll."}
{"text":"I got a groupon to Iron Chef and the food was fantastic. They offer discounted rolls on their menu. The sushi is excellent and the prices are too.  I have been back many times and have always had a good experience. I highly recommend Iron Chef."}
{"text":"Authentic and inexpensive while maintaining great quality of food and service. My families favorites are california roll (our son loves these), Godzilla Roll, Shea Blvd. Roll, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll, Tootsie Roll and the Rock & Roll. We have yet to try the others because we love these ones so much but by the way they sound I'm sure they would be just as good!"}
{"text":"this place is close to home and I eat here about once a month. The sushi is really good. The service is quick and attentive. The place is a little small and you feel cramped in with the other patrons, but its great for a quick bite...in and out."}
{"text":"We've been to this location many times, and have never been disappointed with the food or service. 
The sushi is always fresh, and once we discovered the Super Volcano we automatically order it upon being seated! Their mussels are dee-lish, the sashimi always tender and the prices are oh-so-reasonable. We highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I should have read some of the bad reviews first, before going to that place for lunch. The service was ok, although the waitress forgot to bring out the soup that came with our meal. She rectified that later when our main dishes were already out. My husband ordered mongolian beef, which was good. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, what I got was Kung-Paoish chicken. We also ordered a roll since it was half off. Sakana makes the same roll way better. My chicken tasted ok, however 4 hours later I had food poisoning. It definitely was my chicken that I had for lunch, since I had not eaten anything else. I will not return and strongly advise against going to this place."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We're from Illinois and decided to try this place on our vacation. One of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was so nice, energetic, and had such a great attitude and gave us a great experience. The place was packed on a Wednesday night, but the service was still extremely prompt and the sushi came out quick, even with an order of four \"chef special\" rolls. We highly recommended this restaurant! The outside patio is fun in the spring!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and was impressed at the selection of sushi/sashimi/hand rolls/specialty rolls.  Tried a bunch but the highlight of the evening was the Hawaiian roll which was a deep fried coconut shrimp with banana, wrapped in traditional seaweed and rice, topped with mango. It was a like an instant trip to the islands and complimented the other rolls with it's \"not too sweet\" sweetness.
Service was excellent and considering the place was pretty full, I felt like our sushi arrived quickly.
They have 5 or 6 outside tables for when the weather is nice, so take advantage of that. Also, if you check in on Yelp*, you get an instant coupon worth 50% (yes 50%!) off almost every roll on the menu. Now that's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Excellent teriaki chicken lunch. And sushi! Staff is friendly and food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Great deal with Groupon! The food is tasty and The waitress Andrea was absolutely brilliant!! Beautiful and attentive. Thanks for making our experience truly (inside joke) \"horrible!!!\""}
{"text":"Very tasty and great prices. My husband got one of the specials with shrimp beef and chicken and it was a huge portion. I got the rainbow roll and the crispy tuna roll. Rainbow roll was pretty standard and okay, but the tuna roll wasn't what I expected. Rather than a roll, the tuna and fresh sliced jalapeno was spread on top of a fried tater tot-like nugget but filled with rice. It was good but I like the rolls better.

We had all of this for $30 which was a great deal."}
{"text":"Bummed out!!!  First time trying this place thru delivery.  Ordered a Super Volcano Roll for $13 and its a serving less than the grocery store.  I'll stick with Shogun at least its good and you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This is a great place!!!!!!!!!! Delicious rolls at an excellent price. Plus the staff is really nice. They have happy hour everyday and also all you can eat sushi!!!!! This is my new favorite sushi place in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I'll never get over this place. Used to go here after work, but no longer work close (nor live close) and I still travel for the low prices and the incredible sushi! I recommend anyone and everyone to at least try this place! Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"After eating here xmas evening, I proceeded home and was violently ill - with violent vomiting and diahrea for 12 straight hours.  I was literally sick for over 2 weeks and had to receive medical attention.  I became severely dehydrated and also contracted a bacterial infection.  

A complaint was filed with the County.  Looking a little deeper into their inspection history, I am not surprised I got as sick as I did.  

I have been eating sushi for literally 30 years, and have never had any bad experiences.  This was horrendous!"}
{"text":"Yummy!

The food at Iron Chef was pretty good. Very affordable options, oppose to other Asian/Sushi restaurants. Food is served quickly, and servers are very kind and professional. 

The neon hue lights spread throughout the small restaurant add a nice touch to the atmosphere. Even though this restaurant isn't all that fancy, the food makes up for it. 

We ordered a few sushi rolls, and some crab wontons. The food was very appetizing, and with all the items we ordered, the check surprised me with how cheap it turned out. 

A must try!"}
{"text":"My brother and I went for lunch today.  It's nothing fancy, but their rolls are very good and well priced at 3 for $11.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! Great menu, everyone is always super nice, and great prices!!!!! This has been our go to pace for sushi!!! How can you beat 40% off menu pricing, and great food. A few of our favorites are The Godzilla Roll, Philadelphia Roll, and The Spicy Girl!! Love love love love love love love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service and dirt cheap! 35% and 40% off roll deal even applies to take out. Very accommodating! When I didn't see a specific roll on the menu, they specially made one to my liking."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is delicious , service is quick and friendly and they have half price sushi :).  I'm planing to go back today for dinner with my family."}
{"text":"We thought we would give it a try... It was good! 
Had 2 rolls. Phoenix roll was good.... Add cucumber and it's awesome!  
Shea blvd roll was tasty! Spicy! 
Tuna sashimi was very fresh! We will return :)
And the best part is they have kikusui!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a yummy  place. Service is amazing and the sushi is so delicious. Everyone was so nice ! I was very impressed by the friendliness and quality of the food.  Looking forward  to going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Bought the Groupon and decided to give this a try. Ordered a couple more rolls on top of the Groupon and a sake bomber or two, only 6$! The food was great! I get what people are saying about the service, it's different than expected some other places, but if you don't need to have your hand held by a waiter to have a good time, it's just fine, or was for us anyways. When we walked in we were a little worried, but the place got jam packed on a Thursday night, and I can see why. Would definitely recommend it for good sushi."}
{"text":"Overall I like the place.. So lets start with the Pro's

Pro's
- They have great prices for dine in and take out sushi... However be prepared that they use a bunch of imitation crab meat, and their batter for their tempera items isn't the greatest.
- They deliver!
- Love their edamame (although for $4 I would expect more
- Everyone overall is very pleasant

Cons
- Like I said, lots of imitation stuff.
- Batter for tempura items could be much better!
- Parking is HORRIBLE!!! 
- Don't like that on their online menu they don't explain whats in each role 

Overall pretty happy... For cheap sushi I\"ll keep going there!"}
{"text":"Love it!  My favorite. You can even order it for pick up too if you feel like a cozy night at home :) I get the spicy tuna roll and cucumber roll.   Two thumbs up from me"}
{"text":"Now that I live nearby, Iron Chef has become a regular in our rotation of favorite restaurants. Never have I been disappointed. Prices are great, food is great, try the chicken yaki udon! It is soooo good! It's one of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"This place has Amazing food! Sushi is fantastic. Udon noodles were great. They had 40%-50% of specials off of the sushi menu, which made it cheap. I would pay so much more for their food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. A Starbucks Barista recommended it because my local fav Eastwind closed :( and my brother and I loved it! The Yellowtail Jalepeño roll is simple, delicious and super fresh. Rainbow roll was delicious (one of my personal favorites) and my brother loved the Eel Avocado roll. The prices are super affordable. Definitely definitely check it out. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has some great sushi! We ordered the California roll and Las Vegas roll and they were delicious. Prices are reasonable too, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the sushi was very fresh. The place was packed and we were still seated quickly. Definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"It's a sad day for this place. 1st and foremost my order was incorrect and ended charging me more for a wrong Oder. I ordered the Dragon Roll $13 and got the golden dragon roll $15 mistake was its right next to each other on there menu(even took a picture) . I hold off with the server about but again it might have been a different style. Then I got the Crunchy shrimp tempura roll $10 Note: to self and to everyone that will be eating here, take this food off you're menu please. It's really not a great food to enjoy.  As the roll and hand roll, it was fresh and yummski but it's not hard to mess up on a salmon roll and hand roll. Over all it's very inexpensive 40% off, disappointed about the hype of this place and how highly you are talked about (1st timer) In short Coming from Los Angeles the food price is ok, quality at 1 to 10 is a 7 (over all)  but how can you miss my order (put more light if you can't see) just saying. Hope that next visit  I hope to change my mind. Would I recommend this place to everyone the answer is yes!!! Would you're experience be the same as mine maybe not. But definitely check this place out and if you don't want anything to go wrong then pick the roll and hand roll side of the menu."}
{"text":"While I had a very positive experience with Iron Chef in the past, I can now see why the mixed reviews. This last visit was, I hate to say, pretty awful. Perhaps it depends on who's prepping the fish, but the quality of the sushi I ate on my last visit was the worst I've ever had--chewy, sinewy pieces with, gag, bones! I've never found bones in my sushi before. So disappointing as we paid for the all-you-can-eat and could barely finish our first platter of sushi. I don't think I'll be back as sushi sounds entirely unappetizing to me now."}
{"text":"My son really loves Iron Chef--he enjoys dumplings and noodle dishes especially--and we've received great service when we've gone."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great prices, great service. Only a 4, and not a 5 because it was FREEZING in there and the drinks were weak. Stick to the sushi and you're golden."}
{"text":"This was by far the best sushi I've had. We went with friends on a Friday evening at 6. They run an amazing happy hour! I'm gluten free and got ridiculously excited when I saw the GF Tamari. They can make gf vegetable tempura, or the stuffed jalapeño poppers. We order a lot of different items. They also have Chinese dishes, I had the a spicy chicken dish which was delicious! All the rolls we got were super fresh and had a great serving of fish. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have read many unfair reviews of this restaurant. It appears many people are attempting to \"double dip\". If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live? 
Outside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following:
1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff.
2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant. 
3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive.
All of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is good and servers are very nice.  Like their options in sushi and sashimi, and the prices are very good."}
{"text":"Sweet waitress but the food was average at best ... Everything had a strong fishy taste including the miso soup and the edamame"}
{"text":"Iron Chef is a Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Really. That doesn't make sense. Never heard of this combination. Ok so I was a little skeptical. Small little place. When we walked in I was looking for a hostess but to my surprise nothing. Someone just told us to take a seat. So we find our own table. Waitress is very good and tells us all the Chef's Special rolls are 50% off all the time. Very cool. 

We ordered the Dragon roll, Caterpillar roll, and Crunchy Shrimp roll. The rolls were really good. Very fresh. We really enjoyed them. Not bad for a Chinese/Japanese place. 

I also ordered the House Special Chow Mein which had a nice mix of veggies, BBQ portk, and shrimp. Noodles cooked very good. Overall, it tasted okay. Not great and also not the worst I had before so it was good. 

My wife ordered the Chicken Yaki Udon noodles. So I guess when you order one of their Japanese  dishes they give you a bowl of miso soup. Soup was really good. Have to say it was outstanding. My daughter and wife shared the udon noodles. They both loved it. The chicken was very moist and tender. My wife enjoyed he noodles said it was cooked right and wasn't overpowering. They gobbled it up. So I would have to say they enjoyed it. 

Service we really good. They had three waitresses running around helping out their tables. All were Asian women and were very helpful. Cup were filled in a timely manner and they were really kind and smiling. That's they type of service I'm looking for. Also, the food came out really quickly. They also have a nice little area outside that looked nice to sit at especially with this great weather right now. 

So we had a great time, good food, good sushi and good service. If you can handle a little self service to find your own table then this is the place for you. Choice of Japanese or Chinese food. Really. Iron Chef somehow makes this works. I'm not complaining and I'll be back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was the service. It was a first time drive by visit and I was looking at the reviews. Anyone rating them less than 5 stars is crazy and glad I tried it for myself. Staff was busy and served great food keeping the restaurant happy the entire time. They even have Chinese and Sushi options.. We'll be back to try the other menu items very soon! Definite bookmark spot!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing deals! There 50% off all rolls for the summer is divine! Not the greatest sushi in town but for the price and the experience A in my book! 

My friend got a cucumber roll and the presentation was out of this world and fun! Think rave flashing light fun! We spent so much time taking pics of the food. For sure a fun friend event! 

New regular affordable sushi place! Thought about going back again the next day because I drive past everday coming home from work!"}
{"text":"I have been scouring Phoenix for great Chinese food for years and I have finally found it here. The menu is large and has something for everyone. I am a vegetarian and they had quite a selection of different things for me to choose from. I tried the vegetable spring rolls, vegetable lo mein, and steamed veggies with white sauce on the side off of the weight watchers section. Everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious. I will be making the 30 minute drive from my home to come here more often!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been here on several occasions and the food has always been phenomenal. They have amazing customer service as well. I left my wallet at the restaurant and they kept it safe and returned it back to me! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was able to order delivery online, received the food in a timely manner, it came to me hot and fresh! All of the food tasted amazing! I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Been to The chef twice.  Awesome.  The Sushi was great.  Happy Hour Deals are great.  The chef was a little slow on the busier night, but sometimes quality takes a little longer.  The service was very very friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place initially using a Groupon deal. Since then my boyfriend eats here at least twice a week. It has the best service and daily deals. Excellent spicy tuna. I highly highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Iron Chef is the most reasonably priced sushi place I have come across in town that does not compromise on quality. I got three rolls and a hot tea for less than $15 during happy hour. The rice is nice and sticky. Ambience is okay. They have an outside patio area that is a nice option when the weather permits."}
{"text":"The food was really fresh here! Everything from the soup to the veggies had great flavor! The atmosphere was chill and the menu was cheap. Even the drinks were cheap.  They have sake and beer as well. I would Come back here for a good sushi fix"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's the best sushi I've had within at leastt a 10 mile radius of PV Mall (I live next door). It's fresh and has tasted good every time I've ordered it (more than 5 times by now). I've also had their chow mein, it's good and so are their spring rolls! 

I've also ordered delivery and they are pretty fast! Granted I'm only 5/10 minutes away, but hey. They fudged up and gave me veggie fried rice once instead of the chow mein I had ordered, but fixed it promptly and redelivered the right order. The rice was good too, lol!

On a side note you get good discounts on sushi if you order online and go pick it up, which I will do as I'm leaving work so I can stop and go on my way home. They always give me a free drink too. I believe if you call and place an order you also get a good discount, I think it was like 40%, but that could have been a promo thing.

I recommend! Give them a try :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot for pretty much anything I'm in the mood for. Great special rolls, excellent quality fish, nice intimate atmosphere, and the the best part is the service! Super fast, super friendly :)"}
{"text":"Best little neighborhood sushi place ever. All you need to know is that rolls are 40% all the time and they are soooo good. I love the sunomono salad and shrimp tempura roll. Great seaweed salad and fried rolls are nice and crispy!  Smells fresh and appetizing as soon as you walk in and the bill will leave you smiling as you leave."}
{"text":"Love that you can get Chinese food for the kids while parents can get their sushi on. 

Tons of specials: happy hour half prices rolls, check in for 50% off, or get a group on/livingsocial.

Lots of food for the price. 

Yet not as good as other sushi places we frequent on California. 

It did satisfy our need for sushi while on vacation."}
{"text":"Iron Chef has very tasty sushi and amazing service. We had miso soup, cucumber salad, and three different sushi rolls. The prices were good and the place was busy on the Thursday night we went. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent flyer of Iron Chef.  Food is always fresh and excellent.  Real sushi guys behind the bar.  Most impressive thing... no such thing as Krab on their menu, it's real crab, like it should be.  Try the Phoenix roll.  Lobster, crab, shrimp all in one delicious roll.  Staff is super friendly, the chefs got their \"A\" game on all the time and the prices are unbeatable!!!  I really want to keep this place all for myself!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!

If you have a bottomless stomach, then I'd highly recommend the \"All-You-Can-Eat\" Sushi, the quality matches the quantity!! You even get sashimi, which is unheard of!

It comes with a drink, apps, sushi, and dessert, I couldn't ask for more.

However, don't go late at night. All you will see are dirty tables...

My recomendation, go for lunch or a nice dinner date! This place has great sushi prices regularly as well. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a cool find this place is. I had never heard of it before. My friend wanted to take me out for my birthday and wanted to take me here. It was a nice day so we sat outside. This was a Sunday and you are still allowed to have week day lunch specials. I ordered the bento lunch which came with enough food for two people and my friend got a sushi combo which I don't think the two cost more that 25 dollars. The service was good. I think the waitress could have been a little more attentive but it's Sunday. Would I come back.....Absolutely because for the amount of food and costs you can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is a great option for some classic Asian dishes and sushi. The fish was fresh and all the other dishes came out hot. The General's Tso's chicken was crispy and flavorful. Also, the employees are very enthusiastic. The gyoza were also fried to perfection."}
{"text":"A friend and I eat here often and we feel as though service has been lacking as of late. Usually service is up to par but this time was the last time we will eat here. We normally order the same things over so when she brought out an appetizer we don't normally order I was very confused. She must have misunderstood what we wanted. We ordered an angry edamame and she brought back fried calamari? She then came back and we ordered an angry edamame and she repeated okay angry edamame but ended up bringing us back a regular edamame.. My friend and I were debating if we should return it and ask for the angry edamame but we both knew that if we had returned it that she was just gonna take it back and add the chili flakes to it and guess what? That's exactly what she did! Since the regular edamame already has salt on it it came back SUPER SALTY and we couldn't even eat it. We felt bad for returning it so we just kept it. It DID NOT taste like angry edamame and lacked the chili oil that's usually in it. The Chinese food we ordered didn't taste good at all,the sauce was disgusting and for the fact that the owners are Chinese I was very disappointed. When we were ready to pay we had then told her that we did not order the fried calamari. She was confused and said okay and took it off the bill (again we felt bad, but it was her misunderstanding, was it not?) After all this happened we finally got home and my friend got SUPER sick, which was really weird because she didn't really eat much. She knows for a fact that it was Iron chef because she hadn't eaten anything at all that day. TMI but she had massive diarrhea for hours. We normally don't order sushi here because their sushi is of super low quality and is often times disappointing. I know what good quality sushi is because I've worked in 6 sushi restaurants here in Arizona all of top notch quality. I would pay the extra money for sushi not to get sick any day."}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the service was poor. The server had a difficult time answering simple questions and took half our tables orders then waited until the food came out to take the other halves orders. They did have a good lunch special, but I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is as good as NYC. Excellent service with top notch quality. The green tea is served in a 10 once cup. Not the normal 5 once cup. Come in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here several times...and it was good the first couple of times, however nothing stays the same right?  The last couple of times, kinda sealed the deal for us....Saturday we decided on sushi for dinner....OK Iron Chef it is.  We arrived got the same lady as our server that we did the time prior...sat us in the corner (same table as last) Baby doesn't really like to be put in the corner but OK I'll comply.  She takes our drink order, brings 3/4 of it the first go around, then has to come back the 2nd time with the rest of the drink order (only 3 of us for dinner - 2 beers and 1 sake ordered with 3 waters) she proceeds to take our order (a bit of a language barrier communicating with her, but we get through it), we decide on sushi rolls/sashimi and a couple of salads and edamame to start....brings out our food, it was edible...kinda of all tasted the same and the sashimi was adequate at best.  She comes back to check on us, taking plates as quickly as she could...we actually had to stop her on a couple of them since we weren't finished yet.....a few minutes later, she's back with our check, guess we're DONE.  My husband tells her NO, we're still eating and want to possibly order more....she looks at him, smiles and walks away.....she comes back a few minutes later, determined to take our plates away...NO we're going to order something else....OK one more roll, she brings it a few minutes later, lackluster like the rest.....OK she comes back again with an updated bill and a couple of more fortune cookies, shows over for us , I guess.  Never asked if we wanted something else, dessert, drinks, a punch in the nose.....NOPE you're done , here's your tab....  Last time for this place, I hate to be rushed with my meal, especially when I'M paying for it and the fact that we're not communicating effectively makes it even more frustrating.  There is more sushi out there, I know there is and I will find it!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the sushi here n so resonable! Would have given 5 stars but left the last one for the ambience n space. It's quiet small and can imagine getting crowded n noisy. We ordered the cali roll n it came with a different type of dipping sauce n loved the combo. Also tried the dynamite roll and it's was great too! Different but yum! Definitely try this place for happy hour"}
{"text":"Probably more of a 3.5 from my experience. I do want to preface by saying I did get this to-go so there was no in restaurant dining experience. They pack up everything well, rolls were organized nicely. 

Ordered a Philadelphia roll, crunchy shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, and the Mongolian beef. 

The rolls were pretty good. They weren't life changing but definitely better than others I've experienced in Phoenix. However, for the rolls we got, the price seemed a little high. I'm willing to pay a premium for high quality rolls but this may have just been a little much. 

The Mongolian beef was just okay. Not bad, just average. We would try it again but probably won't ever be craving it. 

Total for food only was $41.40. Again not a bad experience just pricey for what was delivered. I'd recommend it though if you are in the area and searching for some sushi!"}
{"text":"First of, ignore my 4 star rating and read my review if you want my opinion. 
I don't like bash restaurants and leave low star rankings out of respect for business people trying hard. 
Let me first start with the service.
She was so friendly, quick and accommodating and was concerned that we didn't eat much of our food. 

Look, we live nearby and we go top sushi places all the time and price is never an issue. We were even reluctant trying this place out as a happy hour sushi joint is not a good sign since good quality fish shouldn't be discounted. 

We ordered a total of 9 dishes and kept ordering till we could find something we like. The boneless spare ribs was old, hard and awful. 
The tuna martini has the lowest frozen quality Tuna. The rice on the sushi roll was old.
I can go on but I will just leave it there. 

I was hesitant writing this review but I wanted to do so just to ask everybody raving how good it is what they smoking or is it because they like happy hour over quality?"}
{"text":"Can you solve this math problem? 

If there's only one cook and it takes her 15 minutes to prepare one meal at a time, how long will it take for her to prepare four different entrees for a party of four? Answer: too damn long. 

Too bad because the food was actually pretty tasty, but the service was deplorable. My husband's meal arrived first and mine didn't come for a full 15 min later. When we asked about it, the server said they only had one cook and she could only prepare one meal at a time. Good thing the place wasn't crowded. How would she have handled a packed house?"}
{"text":"Shoutout to Sweet Bella for always taking care of myself and family! Great quick bite after work. Have been coming here for years and it is definitely a go to place!"}
{"text":"I love Iron Chef. Great sushi. Great specials. Great service."}
{"text":"I'm giving the 2 stars for the very nice delivery guy. When I called to order for deliver I asked the lady how many pieces come in the yellowtail sashimi, she replied with 2 peices. I replied that I usually get 5 pieces with sashimi when I go to other places. She told me that their pieces are very big. They were NOT. When the food was delivered the sushi was not cold, and the yellowtail was actually yellow , the roll I ordered was very tiny. See in photo. Also this tiny little order was $40"}
{"text":"My first visit here was in October of last year, for my DD's birthday, and we dined in.  It was early afternoon and the small restaurant was fairly empty, so we were attended to quickly. 

I got the Vegetable Tempura appetizer, which included broccoli (which I love), and mushrooms (which I despise), along with other veggies. I gave the mushrooms to the birthday girl, who also got the Spring Rolls appetizer.  Both appetizers were good. The tempura was nice and light; not greasy or oily at all. And the portion was huge.  

So, besides the appetizers, what's a vegan to eat at a sushi bar? Veggie rolls! 
There's a Vegetarian Roll section on the Japanese menu. Mushi mushi! Arigato!

My vegan order:

AVOCADO ROLL: 
stuffed with fresh avocado & rice, and wrapped in the naturally plant-based nori. (Does not have rice surrounding the outer parts of the roll.)

TOFU SKIN & AVOCADO ROLL: 
1st of all, I didn't know that tofu had skin. Secondly, it's delicious! It's firm (not mushy) and the combination with avocado and the rice is very flavorful. The rice is on the outside of this roll. This is my favorite item here. 

There were 8 pieces per roll.

They come with wasabi and ginger, which are both always fresh, and a yummy accompaniment to my veggie rolls. 

(Vegans who are sensitive to cross-contamination may want voice your concerns and make special requests. I did not see them switch up preparation areas or utensils. My food has never tasted \"fishy,\" but...just so you know.)


DD loves the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura Roll & the Shrimp Avocado Roll. She also gets 8 pieces per roll.

All of our rolls were 50% off the regular menu price. I think this discount varies, based on which rolls you get.

They have other veg*n options, like Teriyaki Tofu & a veggie Udon noodle dish, which I'd love to try one day.


We now frequent Iron Chef, but we mostly do carry-out orders. We still get the 50% off though. There is a dedicated carry-out parking space located in front of their door, which is extremely helpful during peak times, when the parking lot is jam-packed.  The employees are always very nice, and they package my veggie rolls separately from the meat rolls.  They also give you a free drink with your to-go order, which is pretty sweet. 

There's a patio dining area outside its front doors.  The inside is dimly lit in the evenings; nice for a date night."}
{"text":"We now love the Love Heart Roll and the Flaming Dragon roll. Iron chef seriously cannot be beat. I love the staff, they know us and our orders now without us even telling them! Friday night regulars!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service! Made my dish with white meat without a problem and the service was great. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The more I sat here, the more I liked this place. Their delightfully tacky decor, cheap booze, quality fish, and quick and friendly service land Iron Chef with a solid 4 stars. I ordered the shrimp tempura (good, but it's from the freezer. They were good like how bagel bites are good.), yellowtail sashimi (buttery, smooth, fresh to death), tamago nigiri (again I think this was premade, but still enjoyable, not old), unagi nigiri (do you ever order eel and it tastes kind of musky? This had a musky flavor), yellowtail and scallion roll, spicy yellowtail roll, and a Boston roll. Again all the yellowtail was superb. The sushi rice was nicely seasoned and not too mushy, not too hard. The Boston roll was good as well. In addition the beer is cheap, and my server was very friendly and nice. And am I weird to like the neon signs and crooning Korean music playing? Overall, a nice meal :)"}
{"text":"120pm on sunday and around 15 customers. Place was clean and we we're promptly seated and given lunch and sushi menus. Ordered shrimp tempura, beef  lowmein, shrimp fried rice, crazy roll, tuna roll, yellow tail roll and salmon tail roll. Tempura batter was a little hesvy2for my taste and teka maki roll was rolled inside out. But everything tasted okay. Service was super quick and efficient...even got free to go sodas for 4 of us...nice."}
{"text":"Always great service and fresh sushi every time we come here.  Wang and Bella really make our experience wonderful.  The prices are excellent and they will customize any cooked menu item or customize a sushi roll for you. I recommend anyone who likes great, fresh sushi at an affordable price, without skimping on quality come here!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the price/ taste of this sushi! This place is a hidden gem in PV. The staff is quick and very friendly. The Phoenix Roll is literally *to die* for. :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a AYCE sushi place and I had to call this place to make sure they actually offered it. They do! You need to request the special menu when you get there too as we were handed a regular menu. 

The food was good and met our expectation. The service was fabulous. Our server was very energetic and let us know about what we could get and what was included and not included. We got 2 soups, edamame, pot sticks and some sushi rolls and we were stuffed! at $25/ea it's a great deal when you think some of these rolls on the regular menu are $15 each..."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because this place delivered to my house at 10:45 PM on a Saturday night. Pretty badass. It was only a $3 delivery charge too. 

That being said, the food- not that great. There's a Panda Express just down the street from my house I wish I would have gone to instead. I could have had food that I know I would have liked, and fed my family for $20 instead of food that was just MEH that cost double. 

Would not get take out again and based on the take out, would never go inside to eat."}
{"text":"Frequent this place often. Love the half priced sushi and it is amazing sushi. Not a ton of rice wrapped around a tiny piece of fish. Philadelphia and Vegas rolls are the best. Friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town :)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and come here. This sushi may not knock your socks off but this is easily the best value anywhere in Phoenix.  I don't bend to say much here other than I'm interrupting my meal to write this review. Been here about 10 times and never been disappointed. If u show up with a crew of 4 or more you are likely to enjoy some sake on the house or at least a free desert. And did I mention everything is 50% off. Enough said, this is your next sushi stop."}
{"text":"Iron Chef might be more like 3.5 stars, but I would need to try it a few more times to say for sure. I ordered 10 or so rolls for pickup for a group. Everything was packed away neatly with soy sauce and chopsticks included. The fish seemed pretty fresh, between the salmon, yellowtail and tuna. The reason why I've given three stars as opposed to four is that the rice didn't have enough vinegar and it was a little bit on the sweeter side. Also, the chef speciality rolls ($10-14), while more expensive were the same size as the normal rolls ($4-8) and usually they are different sizes at other places I've been to. I would try Iron Chef again and then update my review."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"big California roll\" and the \"tootsie roll\" and they were both amazing! Service was good...our server was very friendly! I am very excited to come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I consider ourselves very knowledgeable in the land of all you can eat sushi. We have tried many all you can eat sushi places around the United States. I've seen Iron Chef on Yelp before however I have never made a drive to it due to it being a ways away from my house.

On their menu they have appetizers, nigiri, sushi, and miscellaneous rolls. I would have to say that the best thing there were was the crab rangoons. That's the first red flag. Ordering sushi was a little confusing, as they shorted nigiri' that we ordered. 

The rolls are very basic, not much substance to them. If I had to rate the best sushi roll it would be the spicy salmon crunch. The sunshine roll wasn't too shabby either. The nagiri is was loaded with rice. 

All in all the sushi is not the best quality, and not a huge variety. If you are looking for good all you can eat sushi head hon machi in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese owned Sushi restaurant and they were careful with me since I've order Uni and ask them if it is fresh or not and I asked them in Chinese so they know that they are dealing with a customer who probably have knowledge on the food so they carefully looked at it and told me it is the last order so I ask them if they will eat it themselves and they were willing to give me a discount so I took it.  I came in with Livingsocial offer of prix-fixed deal with one regular and one specialty roll plus appetizer. They said the additional items were half price for me since we were there in happy hours.  The service was delightful and friendly and the food was decent but NOT the freshest sushi in the world but good enough as compared to other restaurants here in the Valley since they are on the mercy of their supplier as far as the quality of the fish goes.  Like a typical Chinese/Korean owned sushi, it tends to be slightly over seasoned but not too intrusive in my eyes.  If you are the REAL sushi master, this place may not cut it for you but it is good enough for me and my friend."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls, amazing service! We took my 2 year old niece and they were very accommodating and even brought her food out right away. Prices were very reasonable. Most definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"We order take-out from here. The sushi is cheaper that way. Lots of options sushi to choose from, plus a standard Chinese menu. It looks like it would be fun to eat in the restaurant and have some drinks, but I can't really comment on the service since I always order take-out. The food is good based on your standard Chinese food standards. If it were just a smudge cheaper, I'd give it 5 starts. You can definitely get better sushi elsewhere but it will cost more."}
{"text":"Seriously good sushi to be had here! And they always have specials which in my opinion are amazing! Hello all day HH and other crazy specials. 
Iron Chef has the best happy hour ever!  All rolls are 50% off and many other items are 40% off, and they have great drink specials.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 8-10.  I honestly need to come back because I wanted to try 20 things on the menu...they have quite an extensive menu.  

I ended up ordering salmon and yellowtail hand rolls, the Golden Dragon roll and the delicious Phoenix roll! Serious melt in your mouth moments!   Everything at Iron Chef seems to have a lovely presentation in general, I was enjoying watching all the dishes come from the kitchen/sushi bar.  You can tell the spring rolls are made in house; nothing too excting to say about spring rolls but they are $2! 
Super-friendly staff and a good vibe environment to add will definitely bring this sushi lover back here!"}
{"text":"We go to Iron Chef when we have a Groupon (which they run pretty regularly).  The service is good and there is rarely a wait for a table...  the food is average.  There's nothing wrong with the food - it just isn't spectacular.  We eat both the sushi and the chinese entrees...  all of it is fine, but nothing blows us away.  It's near home and inexpensive...  so that' usually our reason for going there.  You won't be blown away by the food, but the prices and more than fair and the service is very good (and friendly)."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a handful of times & I always get amazing customer service. Rolls are priced very well. Really cute patio too."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food here. When I walk into a sushi restaurant that is also selling Chinese food and crawfish, I have to question the quality of their food. The sashimi was okay...one of the salmon pieces I ate had a bone in it. The rolls were extremely disappointing, both in quality and presentation. So lackluster in flavor and sloppy in presentation. Their appetizers were probably better than the entrees. I also thought service was a bit slow, considering the restaurant didn't seem that busy when we were there. I would not want to come back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant. As a fish lover in Arizona great sushi is hard to come by. But the sushi is amazing and the staff is great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh...Rarely one of my reviews gets three stars. However this experience was both good and bad.

Place is nice, service is EXCELLENT, food presentation follows, but quality of the food itself is where everything falls apart. 

My friend and I ordered two lemon drop martini...that tasted like LEMONADE!! I swear, there was no alcohol whatsoever in those. So we had to get a shot of vodka to compensate. I'm not sure if my friend got charged for it. I bet our waitress figured immediately why we needed it. No wonder. Perhaps someone else had the same issue. 

Next, the Tuna Tataki appetizer was the worst of the dishes. I understand how valuable tuna is, so why don't you serve fresh tuna and charge a bit more? NO doubt, that tuna was frozen and old. 
The sushi itself was not evil, but neither the best we have ever had (Tokyo and Tiger rolls) 

Wonton soup was delicious, one of my favorite soups and dessert (banana tempura) was good. (The green tea ice cream tasted just like a ball of sugar, no flavor of the green tea, but that's the least). 

I guess the Tuna app and the sushi itself is why I might try other places as far as Japanese cuisine. Too bad cause the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere cozy, but down to the quality of food, a disappointment."}
{"text":"Much as I have enjoyed take out from here in the past, we had an awful experience on Christmas day.
We were looking for a place that was open to go to for dinner, and called a couple of local chinese places. Iron Chef answered their phone and said they were open until 10.30.
We went there around 7PM and found the place busy. We were shown to seats on the patio and waited a while to get someone's attention. It was busy, we were not in a rush and we understood. Once the menus arrived (sushi, Japanese & Chinese) we started reading and figuring out what we felt like that evening. Another 15 minutes passed until we finally flagged down a waiter, not ours apparently, who promised to send someone over to take an order.

More time passed. A giggly young lady arrived and said something in a sing-song voice that seemed to indicate that there was only sushi available and she flitted away before we could confirm what she said. 
Food was being delivered to other tables around us, and the takeout order line had dissipated so we thought it would improve.

45 minutes in and getting hungry now, I flagged down another young lady who asked if we needed more time to order. We said, emphatically, that we were ready. I proceeded to list some items including some Chinese items. She wrote it all down, looked up at the ceiling in a quizzical manner, and then said that there was no Chinese food being made because they were too busy right now.

The other tables around us were being served, including what was clearly Chinese food.
We were obviously not going to get anywhere with this person, so we simply got up and left, hungry and upset.

I doubt that I will ever go to this place ever again. There are many alternative asian places nearby, including competent chains like Panda Express across the road and the very good, family owned and run Golden Wok, less than a mile away"}
{"text":"I like to come here about every other week. I am out of town a lot. 
Nice little place and good sushi."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon to try this place, and I went during lunch.  I wasn't disappointed.  I wasn't wow'd, but it was definitely good, and the staff was friendly and reasonable with regard to time.  I would go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I first checked this place out with a Groupon a few months back. Although our waiter was a little spacey the first time (he filled a sprite up with water twice), the food was enough to bring us back. We now frequent there for the late happy hour which is definitely worth it. Sushi is always good, love the seaweed salad and we also usually split the sesame shrimp.  Very good price, chill environment. We will go back, especially for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in a long time, and great prices!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon I purchased on line they excepted with no issues all the food was also 50% off the sushi was excellent the staff was very friendly and fast in making sushi place is very clean will be coming back again !"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the poor ratings I read about this place.  I did come at the very end of the evening, so I got exceptionally quick service.  I actually almost didn't make it in, but they let me in since I was inside the door before 9:30.  I would have been mad if they didn't let me in because I was flying on the Beeline and almost hit a fox on the way up here.

My friend and I ordered several assortments of sushi and some sake.  We enjoyed our food to a spectacular Game 6 World Series game.  The server and sushi chef didn't mind that we wanted to stay until the game was over.  We just kept ordering more drinks!

Overall, we had a great experience with the quality of our food and the fun atmosphere to watch a game."}
{"text":"Went again with all 3 of my kids. My daughters wheelchair fits perfectly in most areas, which is crazy because the restaurant is so small, but it does. We walk in and are handed menus and served waters. Service is fast. Meals come out in a very timely manner and are just delicious. Seriously some of the best gyoza and rolls we've had. We live in Mesa and I know to take a yummy yummy roll home now as I'll be craving it a few hours after we've left ;)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, most of the staff are pretty personable and friendly, a couple don't smile or talk much but their prices are great. I don't think I can find a single fault with this place and I would definitely recommend. They are quick in the lunchtime rush and the rolls are always delicious and fresh, it's a nice place to relax and talk with friends."}
{"text":"Between 1-3 went in. Really good food miso soup normally really salty however this was really good. Large lunch portions. Wanting to try sushi looks amazing. Had udon noodle dish was really great. I would like to give 5 star review however server was in front of the entrance with phone and had to waive someone for check."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area by far & amazing prices. Everyone is nice, efficient & quick. Cannot complain."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim last night right before they closed and I don't know why I haven't been here before! Service was fast and the sushi was delicious. I had the mussels to start then the dynamite roll. Excellent flavor and seafood was fresh and lots of it. The ambiance here is nice. Not a real fancy place but they have twinkly lights on the patio and its cozy. A little background on my sushi favorites- I like sushi broker, got sushi in Mesa and ra."}
{"text":"Finest cheapest sushi in the world. Been coming here since they opened and have chosen it for 2 of my birthday meals cuz i love it so much."}
{"text":"Service not so good. Sushi mediocre. Way too pricey. 

Simply put, there are way too many sushi restaurants around here to be settling for second best. If you want authenticity, go to Shimogamo. If you want big flavor for American palettes, try Sushi Room. Don't waste your time or money here."}
