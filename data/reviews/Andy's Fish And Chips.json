{"text":"After reading a few great reviews on Urbanspoon, I decided to make my way to Andy's Fish & Chips with my boyfriend. After all, this establishment is only five minutes away from my house. We ordered Cod & Fries ($7.50) to go. I was so excited to try this place so my boyfriend and I ended up eating our meal in the car! Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed. The Cod's batter was extremely dark - it almost looked burnt, but it wasn't burnt. To put things in perspective, it seemed as if the oil had not been changed for months! 

One more thing - the man behind the counter was putting our food and condiments in a plastic bag to go and he accidentally dropped a plastic fork on the ground and put it back with all the other forks. Disgusting.

It's a shame because I was really hoping to like this place. I won't be coming back.

If you're looking for great service and delicious Fish & Chips, I strongly recommend Choice Fish and Chips. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another try..I must be a glutton for punishment cause it was more of the same. Terrible food but nice service from the poor unsuspecting girl behind the counter.'food is terrible ...fish tasted like it was kept too long. Fries were ok but I will NOT be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered through SkipTheDishes. My order didn't take long to arrive. I ordered the Halibut and chips, but the fish was overcooked and dry. It's definitely fish but it's dry to the point that it's almost the texture of chicken. Also, did not receive any cutlery or condiments, don't even ketcup for my fries.  Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, it's very cozy and cute; watch the hot-sauce, be warned!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from Andy's Fish and Chip from JustEat.ca. It was straight forward to order from JustEat.ca - they mentioned that takeout was going to be 45-60minutes. Delivery came in 30 minutes which was amazing.

3 Halibut combos and they all came with fries & a can of pop. Several options of pop like Coke, Sprite, Pepsi, Crush Orange/Cream Soda/Grape, etc. I also asked for condiments which they provided forks (but no knives) and tons of ketchup and salt. Portions were bigger than average and was absolutely filling. Halibut combo was also the most expensive out of the combo(s). 

However, the fish was hard to cut due to it's crispy shell. I don't quite like the shell too much but the fish itself was good. They provided a ton of fries and it was alright/decent. 

Overall, it was satisfying and they have decent fish and chips. Like how fast they got on the delivery order as well :) . I'm just not sure if I'll order from them again because there are other delivery places to try."}
{"text":"My brother wanted to try a new fish and chips place so while passing we decided to go in. The lady behind the counter and the cook were both really nice and friensly. But while it's named after its fish and chips, there is way more Chinese food on the menu than anything which was a bit of a red flag for me. We ordered 2 Halibut and chips and an order of BBQ wings. The wings were pretty good, crispy and aaucy but not oily. The fish on the other hand tasted frozen and was really oily, while the fries were okay. I don't think I'll be back but the service was great."}
{"text":"Had the haddock f&c,$7.95.
Shrimp fried rice, $7.
Mixed fried rice with chicken on top, $8.95.

Both fried rice were ok;
(Trinidad-Chinese fusion).

Fish were dry!!!!
Chips were not fresh-cut but frozen.

Won't order their f&c again since it is not their fort√©."}
{"text":"Spicy fries are good and cheap! Friendly service and cheap beers,  so overall I am happy."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try them again last time they said they had no fish but lots of alcohol ?.... anyways got cod and chips special .... nothing special about it fries could be better ...wasn't expecting much from cod but I made better with  frozen fish and chips ... tartar sauce was good that's why the two stars."}
