{"text":"Ordered the pretzel with Gouda cheese sauce. Not good. The pretzel had some kind of oil brushed on it;  it was grayish brown & didn't taste like butter. Grease off a griddle? Not really sure what it was."}
{"text":"Coming from Germany I really liked their authentic menu. Not 100% German.... But as close as it can get here in Arizona. I loved talking to the crew and can't wait to try more of their menu. Being vegetarian they tried everything to give me the full experience. I loved their Spätzle and it sounds weird... but their green salad was 110% like my grandma's salad would taste like. Hope to have them back soon somewhere close to me! With Kaiserschmarrn as desert!"}
{"text":"I love me some good German food!  Keyword \"good\", and that's hard to find in Phoenix. Eur Haus may be a little pricey but it beats a boring sandwich from the deli and the schnitzel is so good! Nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. I'm not a fan of spaetzel but their addition of gravy definitely perked it up for me. Everything on the menu sounded good actually.  I can't wait to try the Gouda cheese sauce next time. Mmmm....cheeeese."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Chicken Schnitzel and Spätzle I have ever had, and it is a very generous portion. The service is friendly and excellent. I hope this food truck returns to our offices for lunch, I would love to try the pretzel brat w/ gouda cheese sauce. YUM!"}
{"text":"Excited to see this new food truck at Bacon and Beer Classic event. What amazing people and food! Sampled the spaetzle with gravy (traditional style) and one topped with gouda cheese sauce. I've never had spaetzle and both versions were delicious and both topped with bacon. Loved that these German noodles are made in house....what a labor of love :) I can't wait to try more Eur Has Food Truck cuisine!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Food trucks are usually a pricey disappointment - but I have to say, Eur Haus did not disappointment.  They came to my office location, the menu looked great so decided to give it a try.  Went with a group of co-workers so got to try the pretzel with the Gouda cheese dipping sauce.  It was huge and delicious!  The cheese sauce was creamy and the flavor was smooth - perfectly paired with the pretzel.   The chicken schnitzel was a nice large portion of crispy moist chicken, paired with fresh squeezed lemon, left you feeling satisfied but not greasy and heavy.  The chicken comes with a hefty portion of spatzel noodles and brown gravy, oh my word - it was so simple and the texture / taste was something that I loved so much that I want to learn how to make this at home.  Tried the Haus pancake, it's kind of eggy with bacon and chives and it was good but not something I would order again.   Customer service was friendly and pleasant.  I hope they come back to my office - it was an amazing lunch!"}
{"text":"I love the brats and the spetzle. The lady's are great and the food is too!! I have had the pretzel and the spetzle and the brat and the chicken schnitzel. All are fantastic."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! It's been a long time since I have liked a food truck enough to seek them out for another visit or 4. But after first having their crispy chicken schnitzel with spaetzle and thier cheese sauce at 1st Friday in downtown Phoenix, I was HOOKED. The schnitzel comes with a lemon wedge, take my word for it and squeeze that lemon all over the chicken. It gives a tart bright flavor that breaks the richness of the deep fried crust. The cheese on the spaetzle is the definition of comfort food. I have yet to try the spaetzle with their brown gravy.   The next time I had the chicken schnitzel with their salad that was tossed in their homemade dressing. Wow! It was the perfect lunch! The dressing light and bright on the crisp greens perfectly accompanying the schnitzel.  On another visit,during another DTPHX 1st Friday, I had their pretzel with cheese. Oh my! It was warm (well maybe a lil hot, I had to let cool before digging in) and buttery, good on it's own but with their cheese sauce. *mmmm* [mouth watering].   On my most recent visit I had seen photos of  their pretzel bread pudding with chocolate. I knew the next time I visited I wanted to try it. I was skeptical and boy was I glad I tried it when I did. That night they were at Quart Haus in Chandler and were serving up the bread pudding with a chocolate milk stout caramel sauce. Completely impressed.   I don't give 5 stars often, but it has been a long time since I found a food truck I like this much."}
