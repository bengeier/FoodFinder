{"text":"Ordered delivery and food was literally dripping with grease (no pun intended). There was no salad dressing with my large Greek salad and the rude restaurant and when I advise the restaurant of the missing dressing the manager refused to accept that was true or do anything about it. 
Will DEFINITELY not order from here again.

Spare yourself the agony on this one."}
{"text":"Took the risk and tried a gyro from this place today instead of my usuals Messini's or Squareboy. Looks like their thing is extra toppings on the classics and I have to say the pork gyro with onion and jalape√±o was surprisingly good! Gyros with heat. The meat was a bit dry and I'd ask for extra tzatziki next time but the portion size was a bit bigger than most places."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here twice: the first time, everything was tasty and hot, which prompted our second order. However....

My friend and I ordered the chicken pita, the beeftiki pita, and the calamari platter (with tzatziki and pita) to share. The food arrived on time, which we were thankful for, but the orders were wrong...which we were not happy about. 

The chicken in the pita was very rubbery, and there was so much grease it practically exploded out of the bottom as soon as I took a bite. How it managed to leak through the two layers of aluminium paper, I'll never know. My friend had asked for extra tzatziki and vegetables in her beeftiki pita, neither of which were added (despite being charged for it!) The biggest disappointment was the calamari. We had ordered the platter, which is a large portion of calamari served with pita and tzatziki on the side, for $12, but what we got was the calamari pita...which was basically a pita with sauce and vegetables, and FOUR rings of calamari ($7). Obviously a mistake, I called the restaurant to inform them of this and to ask if we could get a refund for the price difference. Instead of being apologetic, whoever answered the phone told me \"you ordered calamari and you got calamari!\" ??? Not sure what is happening here.

Extremely disappointed by this, especially after the first great ordering experience. Unfortunately, I will not be ordered again. My search for tasty and dependable Greek take out continues!"}
