{"text":"I feel that I am a FAIR Yelp-er.  I can only share my experience as it's had.  That said, a friend hosted her own \"new job\" happy hour at this local Morningside pub in Pittsburgh, PA.  Upon arrival, the bar was pretty much empty around 5:30.  Business picked up as we got closer the 8 PM scheduled Penguin game (hockey).  The bartender can make a mean vodka and soda.  I had a turkey melt that was out of this world.  a definite neighborhood bar, the interior is updated (trendy garage door that I assume opens in the warm months).  I was told there is outdoor seating as well.  A good time had by all, I recommend this place for great beer selections and quality bar food.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great local bar with nice beer and food selection! the wings are amazing"}
{"text":"Third time here, and everything was great each time. Wonderful neighborhood pub! They have a great selection of beer and the burgers are wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this local pub! Environment is friendly and relaxed. GET THE WINGS. Everything I have ever ordered here was great but the wings are especially delicious! Have a good variety of local and other beers."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic burger at the Bulldog Pub. If you are a fan of the \"best\" Tessaro burger, you need to give the Bulldog burger a try! AND they have a Monday night special of $5.00 burgers!"}
{"text":"I liked BULLDOG PUB a lot. It's a cute, nondescript local bar and grill with a very friendly staff and solid menu. They serve standard pub fare, but what I've had so far was really good. Most reviewers here have touted the burgers, but I also highly recommend the chicken Caesar salad. That was yummy, without being overly salty.  Of special note was our server Sam, who was bright, attentive, and all kinds of pleasant. She instantly made us feel at home in the pub, and was extremely helpful in suggesting what to pick from the menu. I hope she's there for a while -- she definitely added to the warm atmosphere.  Speaking of which, there was a definite feeling that BULLDOG PUB is very much a place of neighborhood congregation. The other patrons during our visit there were obviously all locals and/or regulars. There was a nice easygoing vibe that was contagious.  If I lived in Morningside, I would definitely go here more often. (I live in Lawrenceville, and the place that most reminds me of BULLDOG PUB is HAMBONE'S, which is bigger and can accommodate performances.) As it is, I'll still make an effort to get out here whenever possible.  Now, let's see that great logo of theirs displayed a little bit more prominently and we'll have ourselves a complete winner! ;)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! The food, service and prices were excellent, my husband and I stopped in for dinner Saturday and I had one of the best Au Jus beef sandwiches ever! My husband really liked his burger (he is very picky) the fries were good and hot! The server was very attentive, the owner was there and introduced himself. This place is a hidden gem! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this casual place. Great variety of pub food. Burgers are great, but my fave is getting the truffle fries and bacon Mac and cheese! They use buschamel (sp?) in the M&C. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Good food, good craft beer selection, friendly and attentive service, great music on the juke box, sports on the big screens for those who care about sports - but not overwhelming for those who don't care about a game. Consistent quality over several visits. Close to where I live, but not at all pretentious like some places in nearby Highland Park or Lawrenceville. Very reasonable prices. Only thing I wish for is improved public transit service to this part of Morningside, but that's not something the Bulldog's owner can address."}
{"text":"Love the location, love the staff, everything is great about the Bulldog Pub. The prices aren't crazy expensive especially for the food, and unlike other bars in Pittsburgh, we never get stuck waiting for hours at a time. Grateful to have something like this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Bulldog is Morningside's only watering hole.   Great place for a beer and bar food. Check it out"}
{"text":"I'm not from PA and was visiting the area and decided to stop by here out of curiosity. I went on a Saturday. It wasn't super crowded but there was only one girl behind the bar, a server/bartender, and one guy that looked like the barback/busser. Customer Service was great. The beer was cold.....  I'm from LA and I've eaten a lot of fish sandwiches and I have never had fish sandwich this good. I've been dreaming about it ever since lol. I will be back if I ever find myself in that part of town again.  Parking can be sketchy..."}
{"text":"The owners are local to the neighborhood and really care about creating a welcoming and homey environment. Also, literally the best wings in Pittsbugh. Plus a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Service was fast & friendly. The burgers are delicious.I love that they have cider on tap, and it is surprisingly inexpensive!  Nice atmosphere...it's fun for a night out, but also subdued enough on a weeknight to have a casual business meeting.  Glad to have such a great pub in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, fantastic service, terrific prices, wonderful food, and a great beer selection - my only two wishes are a) more vegetarian options on the menu and b) that there was more of what Bulldog is doing around the neighborhood. I don't mean that in the sense that I want some schmuck-ish over-priced gastropub taking up space - I mean, more places that create a real local neighborhood atmosphere, a sense of community, with truly great food. Come on Morningside, if this is what you're capable of, let's get another business into one of those For Rent spaces!!"}
{"text":"A great local neighborhood hangout where most of the patrons know one another.  I can't really ask for anything more than good beer and bar food when the Steelers or Pens are playing.  I was here when the Pens won the Stanley Cup this year- and believe me, it was epic.  It was exactly the type of place I wanted to be for such an event.  Great outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Great local bar and pub! The food is great. The staff is friendly. And we love having a neighborhood bar. My husband loves the wings and I'm a big fan of the sweet potato fries and turkey burger. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Local neighborhood pub with excellent food, friendly service, and a great beer selection. I recommend the Steel Town wrap, Buffalo Chicken salad, or a burger - yum! Don't miss out on the outdoor seating in their side yard."}
{"text":"I'm really sad that my fiance and I had to move away from Morningside only a few months after the Bulldog Pub opened. It was so convenient to just walk there to grab a drink or dinner on nights we didn't feel like cooking.   The bar has a great atmosphere! Everyone is super friendly, especially the owner. All the food I have tried there has been really delicious, especially the wings! Prices are pretty typical for any restaurant/bar.  The only complaint I would have is the service, although super friends, was sometimes a little slow, but I totally understand that since it's an up-and-coming place. If you are ever in Morningside you should go here."}
{"text":"Had a really bad meal there. I get that it's a neighborhood bar, but damn, the food was absolutely awful. The only way to make the hamburger I had less flavorful, would be to dip it in cocaine, so as to completely numb your face.  CHANGE YOUR FRIER OIL, MY GAWD!!  Service wasn't  bad and the beers are decent, although a little pricey for such a dump."}
{"text":"My favorite bar, and right around the corner. I like that their staff is personable and will actually talk to you. The drinks are well priced, and the food is yummy. This perfect small bar."}
{"text":"I used to love this place... but prices have gone up quite a bit, the \"specials\" are often just one dollar off, and service and food is very inconsistent. They used to have free-range meat burgers but I guess silently did away with that too. Now, it's just a \"meh\" bar..."}
{"text":"We love Bulldog Pub! My wife and I come here once a week. Great friendly staff, great atmosphere, beer selection is decent, food is tasty.  There's only two reasons I'm giving it 4 instead of five is... One, the beer is a bit overpriced. The rotating selection is good, not great, but always a dollar or two over other bars.  Second, I love the food, but sometimes it is inconsistent. Every once in a while you get wings that aren't quite the same, or a burger that's overcooked. Hopefully once the new menu kicks in this will be resolved."}
{"text":"The Bulldog is a marvelous neighborhood pub with excellent food.  The atmosphere is friendly, and the wait staff is helpful and enthusiastic.  Prices are great and so is the food.  The beer selection is impressive.  You can't go wrong with the Hummus Platter.  I ordered the Grilled Steak Salad, a huge portion size for only $10.  Pair that with East End Big Hop on tap, life is good!"}
{"text":"I would really like to give this place a 3.5, but that isn't an option. It's better than a 3, but this first time experience could have been a little better.   First the positive: I liked that it wasn't super crowded, but we weren't the only ones there. There was some picnic table outside seating which was nice. The menu had quite a bit of options to choose from. I ordered the whiskey rebellion burger. I had ordered it medium, but it came out medium well. I think my burger was missing a topping or maybe it was on there and I just had no idea. Regardless, the sauce was really good and wasn't so overwhelming that it made the burger messy or hard to eat. The fries were amazing! I also had a gristhouse draft which was delicious.   For the less than positive: we had decent attention at first from our server, but once we got our food, we didn't see anyone come out for the rest of our experience. We had to go in to ask if we could get our checks, and after 15 minutes or so of waiting, we went in where we all waited another 5-10 minutes or so to get our checks settled. I will say that our server was also the only one servicing the bar, so I'm not sure if it had to do with staffing for a Monday night or if they are normally staffed that way. So considering it was a one person show for inside and outside, I can understand why it took so long.   Overall: we definitely plan on going back. I can't wait to try something else on the menu because everything sounded good!"}
{"text":"I may be partial to this place because I live in Morningside, but I really do believe it is one of the best bars in Pittsburgh. Looks wise, it's nothing special on the inside and bathrooms could use some work. They do have a small patio out front and a larger fenced in area on the side. It is dog friendly. The food is actually really good here, I especially think they do a good job with the pizza. Great selection at the bar, everything priced really well. Good place to watch games or play darts. I think overall this place just has a really good, relaxed vibe -- you don't really get that at a lot of bars in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great local beer selection at the cheapest prices around. I hate how expensive craft beer is sometimes and the Bulldogs owner understands-they're at least 1-2$ less a pint than anywhere else. The wings are the juiciest in the city and are smothered in a collection of homemade sauces. I love watching games here and enjoying the relaxed atmosphere and the great patio. If you're in the east end or surrounding areas don't forget about the Bulldog in Morningside."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it seems to be going down hill. Disappointing as it was a great neighborhood place. They have changed their fries from delicious homemade to standard frozen fries. I had a chicken sandwich on a recently defrosted bun. Gross!  The bathroom was out of soap and looked like it hadn't been dusted in 6 months.  It would be a huge disappointment for the neighborhood to see this place go out of business.   Retuned with the new management October 2016. This place is better than ever. Delicious and fresh food! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This local pub in morningside is simply fantastic. They have such a comfortable, laid back yet clean ambiance that matches the neighborhood.  The food is fantastic. The fish sandwich is a huge piece of Icelandic cod which could not be better prepared.  The awesome sweet potato fries come with an even better brown sugar butter dip to complement the fries. The smokehouse barbecue chicken sandwich was also fantastic.    Selection of beers is also good and reasonably priced with most beers at around $4. They have east end beers on draft and some nice ciders on draft and bottled including Mackenzie's black cheery cider. I. Short, there is nothing that is short of great in this wonderful neighborhood pub. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Would have been super cool if they could have ever greeted or tried to seat me? About 25 minutes passed without even getting a look from anybody. Then they were too busy so we (party of 5) stood by the front door and customers started complaining about us being there. Meanwhile they sat and served a single man who sat at a 4 seater table. It's frustrating and I would have liked to try it, but I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"How did we not know about this place??  Food was totally awesome, our server was great, and it has a cool vibe.  We visited on a Thursday night around 9pm and it was busy but we managed to score a table with a waitress!  Great Lakes bottles were on special for $3.50 (awesome!) and the food prices are comparable to other bars we frequent.   We loved the atmosphere. It felt like there was a higher education level in the room... all from a visual assessment, but there was an academic feel for some reason. That said, the pretentious level was low. We actually had a discussion about how it felt like being in Shadyside, if Shadyside was cool. It was a mix of young and old, locals and the more hip crowd juxtaposed against photos and neighborhood memorabilia on the walls.   There is a great list of micros - both on tap and bottled. They also have all the usual domestics. For a bar of its size, the wine list is extensive and with much better selections than the usual Yellow Tail choices at other bars.   We ordered medium wings as an app, and I would have preferred they be a little spicier - the sauce was more like a garlic butter than a medium. We ate them and weren't disappointed! Our dinners consisted of a burger/fries and chicken sandwich/fries, which were all great.  My burger was ordered medium and came cooked MEDIUM. YEAH! I also had it topped with pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, and roasted red peppers, which were all fabulous. The chicken was topped with bacon, BBQ sauce, and a something else I forget, but it was gone before I looked across the table more than twice, and received a double thumbs up. Fries are fresh cut and were a little on the greasy side, but still really good.  We reside just over Stanton in the 10th ward of Lawrenceville and will be back to eat our way though the menu!"}
{"text":"I just moved to morningside a few months ago and fell in love with this little pub. The staff is friendly, the owner is accommodating, the beer/wine/ booze selection is great, and the food is yummy. (Try the burgers, they're fab!) What more could you ask from a neighborhood bar?!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and grab some beer and food! They open up garage doors when the weather is nice, which provides for a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Bulldog yesterday. It's clean, friendly and worth the visit. Drinks very reasonable."}
{"text":"A decent beer selection, great food (just a touch over-priced), fantastic atmosphere (both the employees and the dining area). It's a well-done neighborhood bar. The wait staff (Sam, Dan, Lindsey, and Steff) are regular and remember you if you are too."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's basically the nicest neighborhood bar in the city. Having a great craft beer selection in a non-pretencious setting *is the best*. Wish there were more places like this in other parts of the city!"}
{"text":"I haven't explored this side of town much but was in the area for an event with a friend and we were looking for a place to stop for a quick beer and meal without going crazy. Checking some other Yelp reviews, this looked like a winner. A good combination of quick bar food yet not dive food.  Could not have been more spot on!  Street parking was readily available on a Friday at 6p and they had some outdoor seating with a large rolling door to let the fresh air into the bar itself. The atmosphere was very laid back and seemed like a lot of regulars from the neighborhood. Everyone was very friendly and sitting at the bar we were approached right away. They have a rotating draft list of local beers along with your usual suspects.  Great offerings from Grist House, East End and Eleventh Hour were available on our visit. The menu is something you can tell there was thought put into.  Like I previously mentioned, it's bar food but not dive food. We tried French Toast Sticks with a Maple Bourbon dipping sauce that was just incredible!  My buddy did a build your own pizza that I tried a slice of and I must say, it was quite delicious.  So you can use their custom sheets to build your own pizzas and sandwich's. A nice touch for a place like this! I had the Bullpen which was fried bologna, roasted red peppers, fried egg, provolone, garlic aioli on Texas toast.  Don't ask questions, just order it!  Freaking amazing!  Toss in their homemade fries and this is a winner!  Not to mention when I ordered I asked for a side of the Hot Garlic Parmesan for the fries and when they came out there was no side...or so I thought.  When I inquired the waitress said, \"Oh hon, the chef tossed your fries in the sauce to coat them all. I hope that's okay.\"  Of! Course! It! Is!  Wow was that a great improvised move on their part. I'm going to have to ask for that more often.  Add in that prices were extremely reasonable (I think my meal was $9.00) and you have got a nice hidden gem here.  The only drawback I had at all was that we both went in with the intent to get the meatball sandwich everyone talks about. When we tried the waitress asked the chef who happened to be out by the bar if the had meatballs ready and he said he hadn't gotten around to it and just continued his conversation with one of the patrons. She apologized but apparently there was not going to be any meatballs to be had on that evening. Strange but I guess it gave us an opportunity to try something else and come back for the meatballs.  That aside, I really dug this place and think you all will too!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and was delighted to see a pub in walking distance. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks one evening while walking around the neighborhood, and the staff were all really friendly (many of them are teachers and the owner is a former teacher/principal). I didn't try any food, but everything looked good. I'll definitely go again, though I wish they'd start opening up on Sunday for football!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Awesome outdoor seating added which helps the congestion! We still love coming here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for someplace  fun nearby to have a Sunday beer and catch up after busy week. Bulldog Pub popped up as an option and the reviews were great.   Easy to get to, parking right out front. So far so good! Door locked, pretty dark inside. Disappointed. But wait! A sweet furry face was looking out...the door opened and we were welcomed warmly by Gemma, a friendly pup. Also, some folks who insisted we sit and have a beer as we planned. The staff was busy cleaning and rearranging, but made sure we felt welcome and got us a beer anyway.    We didn't have time to eat, but the food looked and smelled terrific. Bar food with a unique twist here and there. As we were leaving we checked out the cozy fenced in outdoor area. Can't WAIT to come back!"}
{"text":"What an all around great experience! The wings are some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly crunchy without tasting fried. The service was also amazing. They even obliged is out of town kids and played the Caps v. Flyers game without batting an eye. From the owner to the bartenders, everyone was incredibly hospitable. We will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Bulldog pub is the perfect neighborhood spot. They have a wide selection of items on their menu that will please even the pickiest person in your group. No frills, nothing fancy, but it's a real Pittsburgh gem. Great place to have a beer and watch the game or just to sit on the patio and enjoy a burger.  Morningside is lucky to have Bulldog Pub on its roster!"}
{"text":"For the last seven years that I've lived here, Morningside has become a more and more desolate neighborhood for amenities, especially when it comes to food, and a pleasant atmosphere for eating it, other than your own home. The neighborhood was pretty much limited to a bank (closed in June of 2013) a Rite Aid, a third world mini-mart specializing in lottery tickets, sodas and smokes, as well as some dusty packaged goods, a yinzer pizza shop with a MAJOR trailer park attitude...and six beauty salons that apparently specialize in 'suburban haus frau'. We had a Stagnos that closed several years ago, and a coffee shop that was way to uppity for the neighborhood, which also closed.  Oh...and the nuisance bar. That haven for yinzer drunks and drug addicts that made 'working class' look like royalty.  Well, that nuisance bar was bought and renovated into a shiny and new Bulldog's Grille, and I have to say, although on opening, they were extremely limited in their offerings, it grew to become a terrific welcomed oasis in the neighborhood.  We decided to give it a try a Friday shortly after they'd opened, and were not disappointed on any real level, although once they got their chef up to speed it got even better.  On opening, aside from a full bar, they only had four items on their menu for opening week. A chicken salad, wings, a fish sandwich, and I can't remember the fourth. It wasn't a burger, which I'd wished it had been, but that would be coming soon, according to the waitress.  So my friend and I, in that never ending search for a fine fish sandwich, opted to try Bulldog's, and we were very pleasantly pleased. Although, in the typical style of da burgh, it came on a freakin' hamburger bun, the fish itself was very tasty, large, and the batter had a yummy zing to it. It was no frills though...just fish and a bun, with tartar sauce, and no inquiry if we'd maybe wanted cheese or lettuce and tomato. But, it was a very decent and filling flavorful sandwich, and the price was very reasonable. It came with fries, which were...well...fries. Nothing special, but not bad. Time went on, and Bulldog's found their chops, and now, a year or so later, that fish sandwich is something to seriously rival ANY of the so-called 'famous' fish sandwiches around town - YES, that means YOU Armand's and Neid's!  Once the burgers came into play - impressive again. Ok, they're never going to hit the level of Winghart's. BUT, for a bar burger? These are a step above the norm. Several varieties to choose from, cooked the way you like, and yum.  It's a very family owned business, with the owner, his wife, his in-laws, and even a mama running around helping out with the customers, and the place was FULL. At one point, mama even walked around with a tray of pepperoni rolls that she was handing out to anyone who wanted one. That was a very yummy homespun touch. The staff evolved into a knowing and helpful group of friendly faces that really do make you feel at home.  And the crowd definitely brought Morningside up a level from what used to spew out of that building on any given day. A lot of family types (of course, it is Morningside) but there were also a lot of young and frankly good looking guys there that never seem to be visible at any other time in the neighborhood. Do they live here? One Kinsey Six could only hope.  Terry Golden and his family have brought an oasis into the neighborhood. More upscale than one would expect for the neighborhood, yet, totally unpretentious. Excellent and consistent food, extremely reasonable prices, and just a generally VERY comfortable 'vibe'.  On the next visit, I tried the wings. Another winner. Plump, juicy, and creative sauces.   Kudos, Bulldog's, for bringing some modern style to an otherwise deprived neighborhood.  Addendum: Had to re-write a few things and up it to a full five stars - they've truly earned it."}
{"text":"Alrite - I'm an Italian Yinzer who loves beers, meatballs, and Turner's Iced Tea.  When I say the Bulldog has one of the greatest meatball sandwiches I've ever had, I'm not lying.  I do my best to get my \"cool friends\" out of Lawrenceville and into a neighborhood bar with awesome specials, a friendly staff, and an updated jukebox (which is apparently very difficult to remove from the wall - sorry again about that, guys).  The BDP doesn't hate kids or dogs, either - so bonus points.  I can't wait for 3rd winter to be over so I can eat wings on their killer patio."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hang out.   Last night I stopped in for a beer and a bite with the wife.   Folks could not have been nicer.   Place had a nice beer selection and a great local vibe.   I had a steak wrap and sweet potato fries that was excellent.    Everything was very reasonably priced.   The place has a roll up door in the front so I am assuming when the weather warms up there will be some outdoor seating.     If you need a bite in Morningside or Highland Park, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but I don't like Morningside it feels like an abandoned suburban neighborhood attached to a city. Having said that, when I had to go there I was always thankful for Bulldog Pub. I love it there. It's got a proper feel to it-clean and spacious and a cute little set up. I like that they have good beers on tap at reasonable prices. Have only eaten fries there but they were yummy."}
{"text":"I love this quaint neighborhood bar. The food is great and everyone is so friendly.   The beer selection is good, too.   I ordered the Cobb salad and it was just how I like it.   Just a great place to hang and watch sports or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The Bulldog recently updated its menu, and my tune has changed!!!  Just had an excellent burger on a crispy, freshly-toasted bun, with amazing fries- they look fresh cut, but I don't care really cause they were delicious!  Also- they have fresh-brewed iced tea now!  I'm not a regular drinker, but my husband enjoys beer with his dinner, so we go to pub type places a lot.  It is a requirement that the places we go to have fresh brewed iced tea for me- and now Bulldog delivers!  Service was pretty slow, that's the only reason for one less star.  Can't wait to come back to my neighborhood pub!"}
{"text":"A much needed pub and restaurant in a fantastic neighborhood. Nice beer selection with great food."}
{"text":"We used to go to Bulldog's once a week or every other week. We are within walking distance, so it's a great easy dinner out option. The last few times that we have gone, the food was overcooked and overpriced for the quality.   I love that they added a kid's menu, but $8 for a kid's chicken fingers and fries is super steep. Even Burgatory charges less than that.   They have a great beer selection, but it's pretty pricey. They also did away with a traditional happy hour time, which is one of the reasons why we liked to go.   The staff is always friendly, but I think for a neighborhood pub, it's a little too expensive for what it is."}
