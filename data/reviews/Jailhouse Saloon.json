{"text":"This is a dive bar with over priced drinks. Went with my friends and we had to deal with a group of underage kids who got in with there fake Ids. It's awful."}
{"text":"I have visited this local bar 3 times for karaoke and left early all 3 times. This bar is very blue color which would make sense since there are so many factorys and other tough guy jobs in downtown Cory. It's veryindustrial, I guess is the right wording.  I ran into a couple of characters and just didn't feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Good Place to watch Sports on tv plus daily Beer  Specials every day all day plus Happy Hour specials and Late night DJ for the college crowd. The Food is good also they have daily food specials. I had a coors Banquet 16 ounce for a Dollar  WOW  you can't get any better then that plus Attractive Bartenders don't hurt will definitely visit the Jailhouse again for A Pirate game."}
{"text":"Well I have gone there multiple times . Loved the food over there  . Not really a great place for family get-togethers unfortunately . But mainly a local crowd venue . If you're a local it's a great little hangout . Though of course it's a pub people - Not really a great family spot. Though if you're looking for good food in a local spot , try it out  ! Well, something that I thought I just might note : \" Now if you're looking for a place to \" meet up \" with your pals after a day at work : this place will do it ! Nice new flatscreen tv's playing the games ."}
