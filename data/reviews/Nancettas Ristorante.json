{"text":"Terrible! Told us we had to wait about 20 minutes because we didn't have a reservation even though the place was mostly empty. The hostess was rude. We didn't even stick around to try the food. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Very good food!

Great italian dressing. The owner and his wife were very accommodating! I had the chicken romano...it was delicious. The only negative about this restaurant is some portions are small but the pasta dishes are much bigger.

I will definitely be going back in the future"}
{"text":"Having lived in Pittsburgh for the past two years I have had the opportunity to visit Nancettas two-three times a year each year. Today, as every time before, the food was simply excellent.

In this instance, I had a Duck breast over Risotto with wild cherry sauce. The duck was well seared, flavorful, and pleasantly juicy. Served with a small side of delightfully crispy skin and a well balanced cherry sauce, the meal doesn't disappoint even in the slightest.

The staff also deserves some mention as they've always been pleasant and on this particular visit I had a moment to speak with the Chef and hear his first hand interest and passion for creating exquisite meals.

On a more recent trip we got a menu item the Chef suggested, which was Alfredo and Duck. It was absolutely delightful. I'm a duck enthusiast and that man knows how to cook it, flawlessly. I really cannot stress how satisfied I come away from my eating experiences at Nancettas."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. They cook everything to order and the dishes are unique and delicious! 
We ordered three small plates to start - artichokes wrapped in prosciutto, bresaola, and shrimp cakes - such a fun way to do appetizers and so affordable!
Dinner we ordered the gnocchi with pesto, the wild boar over risotto, and the bolognese with short rib. All pasta is homemade and is phenomenal and the bolognese was surely one of the best we've ever had (including trips to Italy). 

We will DEFINITELY be back - go here!!!!"}
{"text":"We got take out. The staff that answered the phone were not very polite.  Food took longer than they said.  The pasta was good but 2 plates of spaghetti and meatballs is not worth $50. It left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Waited to write a review until I ate every meal here. Each-brunch, lunch, & dinner-have all been good experiences. 
The common threads are yummy food, multiple vegetarian options, great service, and no one else in the restaurant. Each time we thought they were closed based on how few cars were in the parking lot, only to be greeted by the smiling owner and seated in an empty dining area. 
I don't know if people don't know it's tucked away back here or if we come at off times, or what.  Regardless, we have never been disappointed, and it's kind of nice to be able to hear the music play in the background and not have to talk over anyone! 
Service is always super accommodating. The first thing they tell you is they can do whatever you want and everything is made to order. This is our family's dream since we all have different dietary preferences or restrictions. This is one of the few places you don't have to feel uncomfortable asking for special substitutions-or a meal not even on the menu! 
Bread is fresh, pasta homemade, and you can tell special care is taken to each meal. Will definitely continue to come back. 

Special note: For dinner we had a server named \"John\" who was really great. Was excellent with my 1 yo daughter, getting her special bread so she didn't burn her mouth or have to wait for the hot bread to cool. Extra touches like this are worth mentioning. Thank you !!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience...I will not return! I feel the management is disrespectful, rude and does not act professional...if your looking for a friendly family environment it's not here!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner at Nancettas tonight!  My favorite... The yellow beet salad.  (See photo!)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant . We had a party of 10 and the service was excellent. Every dish was made to order and steaming hot and delicious. I would highly recommend dining here. This is a dining experience not a \"fast food\" restaurant. The atmosphere was AWSOME. I would recommend to all."}
{"text":"Everything about our visit to Nancetta's last night was delightful.  From the fig and date appetizers to the gelato and tiramisu desserts - with veal entrees in between - the food was superb!  The presentation and service also deserve recognition.  Excellent!  The extensive menu offers a variety of interesting choices, and we'll be back again soon for another very pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"Incredible food...homemade pasta is phenomenal.  Greens and beans are non-traditional but amazing.  Friendly spot with great food that not enough people know about."}
{"text":"AN OK NIGHT OUT...I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER

Date night was very nice because of my date but could have been better here. Unfortunately, at 730pm they had run out of 2 items on the menu that I was hoping to try so I went for a pasta dish.

It was only OK. I would be willing to try other things here but I think it just wasn't my night.

The one highlight was the \"greens and beans\" a old simple Italian classic with lots of flavor. 

I may try again but not anytime soon. With such a competitive food scene EVERYONE has to step up their game!"}
{"text":"TL;DR - waited 60 min for mediocre app, 90 minutes for mediocre soup and salad, 120 min for decent mains. Beautiful decor, flawed concept. 

The good: the restaurant is absolutely beautifully decorated inside. The waitress knew the menu very well, was polite, made good suggestions, and never let our water glasses get even half empty. The veal Romano and seafood pasta dishes were tasty. 

The bad: I wanted to take my mom out somewhere nice for an early mother's day dinner. She had been wanting to try this place out for a long time. The restaurant is very small and it was hard to make a reservation. When we got there, it was practically empty of people but full of tables. The two of us were seated at a table for 6. Why...I don't know. Because there were too many tables, we were practically sitting with the two women next to us. 

It took over 10 minutes for the manager to tell us the specials. Another few minutes the one and only waitress came and took our drink order. Once our drinks are delivered, we ordered an appetizer (risotto balls), the veal and leek soup, and the best salad. The risotto balls came....45 minutes later. They were OK (nothing to write home about). Another 30 minutes later my soup arrives but my mom's salad wasn't ready. At 8:30 (90 minutes into dinner), my mom's salad finally arrived. Again, the food was OK. At this point we're beginning to get upset at how long we've waited to have our appetizer, soup, and salad served. There were only 8 people in the dining room and everyone has been waiting far too long and starts asking the waitress where the food was. We can all tell she's getting upset that a nearly empty dining room is full of hungry customers. 

The ugly: At this point, it's almost 9 pm and everyone has been there since between 7 and 7:30. The waitress starts apologizing to everyone about the delay. She says this is typical and whenever she puts pressure on the kitchen, she states the chef just yells at her. Several couples just ask for their food to go. At 9:00, the food starts coming out. Everyone has been served except us. We hear our waitress tell the chef she still needs a veal Romano. Does that mean they didn't ever start cooking our food? Our food arrives at 9:15...2 hours and 5 minutes after we were seated. We ate some of our meals but we were just too tired to eat any more. We get the rest of our meals wrapped up to go. 

Nancettas prides itself on its meals being \"scratch made in house.\" They state that their meals take a little longer than most restaurants. Making your customers wait 2 hours is bad for business. 

How can a restaurant be successful if it alienates its customers by making them wait an ungodly amount of time before serving them? How can a restaurant be profitable if it can only turn a table once in a dinner session? The issue here is management turning a blind eye to a major issue and a failed concept. We will not be back and we certainly will not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. My wife and I and our 14 year old went there for dinner last night. The place is quaint and the decor is nice. Both waiters were friendly and attentive and the owner walked around helping to serve, bus tables and do what ever was needed. That's it for the good parts.

We did not know that they did not have a liquor license and they offered a glass of  complimentary wine. That was nice but the wine arrived in 2 dirty glasses-they had large stains and lip stick. They looked like they had merely been rinsed and allowed to dry. We asked for new glasses. Shortly afterwards I watched th waiter deliver 2 filthy glasses to the next table-the patrons did not take note but we did.

We ordered the beans and greens. It arrived and looked great but was bland and we had to add salt and pepper liberally to get some flavor. We love beans a greens and so were disappointed.

Next came the salads. Both had a mix of old slimy lettuce bits along with yellowed and old pieces of salad. We asked for new salads and they came promptly and cheerfully but again we picked through the salad to remove the bad lettuce.

Next, after a long 30 minute wait, came the eggplant parmesian. It was very attractive and we were disappointed to find that it was luke warm and had little taste.

Our son ordered the pizza margherita. Again, it looked wonderful but was disappointing. The tomatoes were hard and not flavorful and there was little flavor from the cheese. The basil could be tasted but nothing else.

We were all disappointed and my wife and I said unrehersed at the same time, \"what a shame.\"

We wanted to love this place but cannot-unfortunatley we will not return. The owner does not know that she has a quailty control problem with the quality of the food they put in front of customers, getting food out in a reasonable amount of time as well with the way they clean their glasses. If you go there I hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"Wow, great homemade ravioli, great wine list.

Ambience is impressive - would be great for a date."}
{"text":"The service was sooo slow. I understand that everything is cooked to order but 3 of the 6 of us were finished eating before the remainder of our party even received food. 

When we finally did get our food, it was bland, mediocre at best. It was decent portion size but grossly under seasoned. 

Unfortunately, we will not be back."}
{"text":"A horrible way to spend your Valentines Day. Let me start by saying that I used to be a waitress at a very nice restaurant in Indiana, Pa, so I KNOW how it can be on Valentine's Day and other busy evenings...It was our first time here, and definitely our last. When we walked in, we thought the restaurant was very cute, and we were excited to be seated. A few minutes later, we were acknowledged and sat. Our waiter came to greet us, tell us about the specials, and also warned us that since the meals were all made in house, that it takes longer than expected. He suggested we ordered appetizers to hold us over. We ordered calamari, dates, and short ribs, as well as our meals which we both chose duck. 10 minutes later our waiter comes back to inform us that they were out of duck. No problem- we ordered the wild boar and a veal dish, as well as some cocktails. Our waiter then brought us bread which was cold and hard. After an hour and a half without being brought our appetizers, I asked the waiter how much longer it would be. He didn't apologize or answer my question, instead, said \"waiting on the kitchen\". I thought it was time to talk to the manager/owner, whoever she was. She came over to the table and I explained that we ordered 3 appetizers because we knew the meals would be awhile, but an hour and a half for appetizers to come out was inexcusable. She agreed, and said they would be out soon. She didn't apologize, or try to please us by offering drinks, a free appetizer, etc. About 10 minutes later, our waiter finally brought our appetizers. Again, no apology. The dates were terrible. The short ribs were very good, and the calamari had NO lemon caper sauce on them, as the menu indicated. At this point we were starving, so we didn't even mention it. About 45 minutes after the apps were brought, our meals came. The wild boar was good, although the mushrooms were ice cold. The veal dish was absolutely terrible, my boyfriend hated it. So, you'd think our waiter would be trying very hard to make us happy by this point-WRONG. He did offer us dessert on the house, but we were so angry by this point and quite frankly, did not want to spend another minute in the restaurant. The waiter then brings us our check, which had all of our appetizers, drinks, and meals on, INCLUDING the 2 duck meals that we did not get. Honestly, that was the last draw for us. You'd think this waiter would be sure our check is right, after all that went wrong. Our waiter was horrible. Our service was horrible. Our meals were average at best. It was also very Cold in the restaurant, and for Valentines Day weekend, it wasn't even busy. Now I know why. Save yourself a trip, it doesn't even deserve one star.."}
{"text":"We had wonderful homemade food and a great atmosphere the owners are friendly and sociable. While we were there I heard people say they were bringing back their friends and that they thought everything was delicious and so did we!  The homemade gnocchi was very delicious lightweight you could eat the whole plate because it melts in your mouth. And my husband had the braised short ribs with the homemade pasta we ate everything down to the bone!!!  Nancy's homemade desserts are delightful! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Homemade noodles delicious ; small quantities; expensive; inconsistent. Not kid friendly.  Where to start, I read reviews and got excited this could be a place for me to go when I come to town.  Took my family and my sisters family here for dinner. First red flag is no children's menu - yes flexibility they can make something for us -- price still adult prices. We ordered (read menu for official names): spicy sausage/peppers/spaghetti - it was really good but smallest dish ever for $18.  I also ordered side salad for $6 also small but dressing was very good Italian (emulsified it)  Mom loved her gnocchi with marinara and wished they had a few more on the plate. Husband did not like his chicken Alfredo-cheese was like a Mac and cheese dish.  They were out of ravioli and lasagna.  We were never told about the specials that after ordering we heard the waitress tell the next table. My sister loves eggplant parmigiana and it comes out with the breading tasting pan burned-I tasted and agreed.  There appeared to only be one waitress and we never got refills on our drinks and the food took what seemed to be forever coming out of the kitchen. Could be a place for a romantic dinner and definitely the noodles are delicious but don't go if you are hoping for a lot of food for the price and I'd leave the kids at home. They don't need an $18 meal."}
{"text":"Nancettas is amazing!! I can't believe this place only has 3 1/2 stars! If you love authentic Italian food like I do, this is the closest to Italy that you'll get in Pittsburgh! 

I had dinner reservations on a Saturday night for my boyfriend, my parents, and I.  When we arrived, we sat at the bar for a drink before we sat at our table. We ended up making great conversation with the owners, a fabulous couple who are both so sweet! They even brought us out a plate of his homemade Soppressata. My father has had a lot of soppressata in his life (including his own family's homemade in Italy) and he said this was the best he's ever had! The rest of us agreed with him as well. They also had homemade bread with an amazing olive oil dipping sauce. They kept bringing it out, and we continued to eat it! 

For dinner, it was a beautiful June night, so we decided to eat outside. All of the other customers were also eating outside ( I don't think anyone was inside eating). Their patio is so cute, covered with trees and umbrellas! We continued to have amazing service during our meal by both the owners and our waitress. For my dinner, I ordered chicken piccata and shared a side of the gnocchi with Chris. Both were amazing! Everyone else said how amazing their meals were too- eggplant parm, veal parm, and Chris tried rabbit (which was actually great!) 

Since we were there to celebrate, we also decided to get dessert! Even though we were all full, we saw the table next to us order dessert and we were basically drooling looking at it. The 4 of us shared the lemon tart & the raspberry chocolate chip gelato. I am not much of dessert person but these were both amazing & the perfect ending to a great meal! Even if you don't live close to Nancettas (like us) it was worth the drive! I cannot wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good, to the interactive owner, homeade bread and pasta to the wine! Well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in the state. Would rather starve than return. Bad service,bad food, and poorly priced!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  My family went here last minute one night and we were so happy that we did!   The food was incredible!  Great food is not fast food!  We had a very relaxing dinner with the chef, his wife and the server who were all very attentive to us.  The pear asiago ravioli was so unique and delicious.  My husband special ordered linguini with clam sauce (which was not on the menu) and the chef made it without hesitation!  Very impressed with the wine list too.
We will definitely be back to this little hole in the wall gem!  So glad we found it!  
Thank you chef/owner for a wonderful meal and evening!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. The food was amazing but the service itself is enough for me to come back. Such a mom and pop place and everyone was so nice. By the time I left, I didn't want to! I wanted to stay and hang out with the owners and server because by the end of my meal I felt like I was part of the family! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dish of spaghetti bolognese.  My friends loved their dinners of chicken piccata and gnocchi w pesto.   
We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful patio.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely come back to try another dish."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little hidden gem. You must visit.  Had a fabulous lunch, sharing appetizer plates of pillow light Gnocchi in pesto cream sauce, Pear and Asiago filled Ravioli in sage butter; veal piccata in lemon oil caper sauce and lightly breaded chicken parmesan. Dessert was a treat too;  lemon tart with whipped cream on the side. Every item on the menu is homemade from scratch,  The owners, Paul an Nancy were delightful hosts.  Even offered a plate of Suprasatta with roasted peppers when we told them growing up Italian, our family always made these sausages.  So delicious.  Interior is very classy and charming; nice outdoor patio when weather permits.  We will definitely return.  Jane B"}
{"text":"Fabulous Food. The most amazing eggplant parm I have ever eaten? And I have ordered eggplant parm in many many restaurants. Loved it. Decor is lovely. Good wine, great hosts& owners . A definite go to Italian restaurant in O'Hara township!!!"}
{"text":"If you are ready for a wonderful, high quality dining experience, even for brunch, try Nancettas. I went there for brunch on a snowy Sunday and found a warm delicious meal waiting for me. Each of our meals was made to order, carefully prepared, and served with fresh baked (in house) moist bread. I had a mozzarella and tomato quiche, mom had a vegetable omelette. The owners, Nancy and Paul, were great hosts and added a touch of \"personal\" to the whole brunch. The mimosa (hey, it was Sunday, cold, and snowy outside) was made of fresh squeezed juice. I wish a had a photo of the meal, but it looked so good I forgot about photos and just started eating. I look forward to many meals there, and fun times sitting at their beautiful bar ordering from an impressive wine list. This was not only brunch, it was a great time."}
{"text":"There were 5 of us for dinner. It was not a very busy night at the restaurant, but the atmosphere was perfect.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.  She took care of all of our needs and we moved through dinner at a steady and relaxed pace.  We never felt rushed and the time flowed well for a leisurely meal. We ordered 3 appetizers for the table and a few bottles of wine.  Each of us tried a different main course.  We tried a little of each and all of them were delicious.  The owner/chef came out to check on us and told us about the food and his style of cooking.  He was pleasant and took a lot of pride in his establishment.  This is a great place to relax and enjoy a meal with friends and family. I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Stopped after a discussion with our friends. Great Bolognese with rib and Wife had homemade raviolis. 
Loved the Service we eat early but what the heck.
Summation of location ....\" We shall return\"
Cheers"}
{"text":"Picked up some Caesar salad, bread, and sides of pasta to take to a dinner. Everything was delicious and extremely fresh!

The bolognese sauce on their fresh made spaghetti pasta was great!!

I look forward to coming back next time I am in town to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"I just had a great Italian meal - one of the finest I've ever had.
The food was cooked to order and the pace of the meal was perfect - slow for some but gave us time for conversation.
The wine selection was great.
I would recommend this restaurant for people who like authentic Italian food w/ homemade pasta and bread and deserts."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way.  Beautiful atmosphere.  Super wine list. Attentive and helpful staff. The owner made frequent visits to the table. Wild boar was tender and flavorful, gnocchi melts in your mouth, veal medallions sumptuous.  Don't forget the desert"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 7:15pm, we arrived early and were sat immediately. Great start to the night. It took awhile to get drink orders but the server really tried hard to find me the right wine. That's the last good thing that happened. It took forever to give our dinner orders. There was 1 server and 1 bartender but they had 2 tables each. Then we got our salads about an hour into it and dinner 2 hours after walking into the building. I had to ask where the food was and she was shocked. When I went to ask her I found her making the salads without gloves and eating while she made them. There are other things that left a bad taste in my mouth but all I need to say is that if you want a 4 hour leisurely dinner then this is the place but don't expect to be serviced or have food in front of you."}
{"text":"What a delightful and delicious evening! We sat outside on an early summer evening and you would never have known you were on the back side of a parking lot.

The food, the service, the wine...everything was wonderful. Yes you may need to wait a bit, but isn't that what an evening out should be - delightful and not rushed? You are in for a treat with the food so relax and enjoy.

All 4 people in our party were thrilled with our food and the whole evening!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service!  Owners were very attentive. You will Not be disappointed ! The calamari was the best ever. This was our third visit and we will be returning soon. This place is a hidden gem in Fox Chapel."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's family owned and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. All the food is made in-house and is really fresh. It doesn't get much better than homemade pasta and bread! I've tried the pasta bolognese with short ribs, eggplant parmesan, caprese salad and calamari. Highly recommended!! Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"FIRST IMPRESSION. Four of us had a lovely dinner here on a recent Saturday. We arrived early in the evening and briefly had the place to ourselves. The service was attentive but not overbearing. Two in our party have dietary restrictions, and the waiter answered all questions about ingredients and techniques, so that we could make good decisions. 

My salmon was absolutely perfect--tender, done just to perfection, and nicely seasoned. Two others in the group enjoyed their fish dishes, and the youngster with us downed an entire pizza (since this kid is usually fussy, I saw that as a ringing endorsement). 

I plan to return to this nice little place."}
{"text":"Nancetta's is the best Italian food I've had in Pittsburgh! Everything is made in house from scratch, and the ownership and staff make you feel like part of the family. 

I had pasta with rabbit. This was a large portion of food. The past was cooked al dente and was perfect, and I couldn't believe how much rabbit meat there was on the plate. I had to take some home. This was my first time eating rabbit. It's tender and has a similar taste to chicken but a little more \"gamey.\" I also got a side of gnocchi and wow! It's so light and melts in your mouth. The best gnocchi I've ever had. 

This will go down as one of my favorites, and I will go back frequently!"}
