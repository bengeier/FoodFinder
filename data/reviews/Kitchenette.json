{"text":"Definitely worth a visit.  We trekked to this corner of the city on a recent trip based on the Unique Eats segment and other Yelp reviews.  The place has a magnetic charm.  The open kitchen and casually chic decor welcome you into the restaurant.  Soon thereafter you find there's a certain playfulness to the menu.     The Japanese tacos were outstanding, as was the wine suggested by our waitress.  I wish the taco portion was split among two shells instead of large one,  and I really wish that soft corn tortillas were used instead of the hard version (it cracks and was a little greasy).  The chile rellenos and cod were both boldly flavorful.  Side note:  The chef is dedicated to serving only sustainably caught fish; a decision the demands a lot of creativity and shows a lot of thoughtfulness.  Many thanks to you!"}
{"text":"Consistent, well-prepared French cuisine, with a bit of cute showmanship and an adorable and attentive couple who run the place with precision. Since they took over last year, La Kitchenette has done a complete 180 and should be a destination restaurant. The gazpacho is excellent, and the salmon in smoke absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"What a delightful dining experience at Kitchenette. It's an unassuming  yet suave place somewhat off the beaten path that manages to do everything right! From the service to the atmosphere to the KILLER desserts....Kitchenette was perfect from start to finish.  We started with vodka shots with homemade pickled jalapenos...basically akin to a punch in the face. A necessary evil. Then we had a selection of oysters...the tomatillo mignonette just tasted so...hmmm...just so FRESH! We are oyster cultists and welcomed the original presentation. You have to try the grilled oysters with bacon and garlic butter-YUM! Why aren't they serving these everywhere??!! We opted for a bunch of small plates, but will definitely be going back to try the seafood stews. The mini po'boys were exactly what you would expect. The octopus was sublime. The japanese taco original and super tasty (I am obsessed with pickled daikon, so I may be biased). The eel tostada...yes EEL tostada was surprisingly good.  I hear it's delicious, alas I am not a huge fan of ugly, creepy eels...but I'll eat kidneys, go figure. Did you know that eel blood is toxic to humans?!  I digress... Next we had lobster nachos...brilliant idea! I may have shed a small tear. Ultimate upscale comfort food. AND THEN IT APPEARED....this insane dessert...probably my favourite dessert ever.....caramel, popcorn, ice cream, sticky toffee pudding heavenly magic....trust me I am not doing it justice. It was phenomenal.  All in all an awesome evening!"}
{"text":"Went for New Year's Eve and the owners took such great care to make it a wonderful and festive experience. The food was exceptional and the service excellent.  The owners are generous warm and charming. Great location and lovely space. I will definitely return on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here based on a recommendation from a friend and we were not disappointed. We both had the 9 dish tasting menu and we loved everything that was brought to us. The highlights were definitely the Foie Gras, one of the best I have ever had, and the duck ravioli was exquisite.  The food here transports you to France which is exactly what I hope for when coming to Montreal.  I definitely recommend anyone visiting Montreal to make a point of stopping by Kitchenette."}
{"text":"I love this place for several reasons. First, the food was delicious. We had the chicken fried beets and fried calamari as entrées, both perfectly executed. For the main course the had a beer braised short rib with greens and a bed of mashed potatoes. Succulent. Secondly, the service was outstanding! Or easier took the time, knew the menu details inside and out, made solid recommendations and just so pleasant. Thirdly, the decor and the feel of the place was just right! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nous avons pris le menu dégustation . Tout étaient bon sans plus .  Aucune éclosion de saveurs. L'accord vin est de 30$. Verres remplis généreusement  mais de qualité générique.  Le service est excellent et attentionné.  Soirée agréable  . Cuisine sans surprise."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, Kitchenette proved to be a winner.  We started with an app that was being served for the first time that night, gnocchi with dungeness crab and lobster bisque.  Super delicious, if a somewhat small serving.  Except for this dish, the servings were quite generous throughout.  The other starter sampled was a ceviche of  spot prawns, great fresh flavour with lime, avocado and shredded lettuce.  Mains: cioppino and lobster & grits.My order of cioppino was teeming with all manner of aquatic goodies including Texas red fish, which was unknown to me, in a flavourful broth; served with grilled sourdough and rouille.  My wife's lobster with grits was really outstanding; chunks of lobster on a bed of grits; intermingled were crispy crunchy fried shallots, red peppers and bacon, all sauced with a roasted red pepper sauce.  Unfortunately we failed to finish either dish because we wanted to leave room for the acclaimed bread pudding.  We were not disappointed with a very large serving of very rich and buttery bread set in a Caramel sauce, tweaked with Jack Daniels and toasted pecans.  Laid back and charming could be used to describe the atmosphere, with professional service.   A little off the beaten track, Kitchenette is directly across the street from the Radio Canada CBC building; definitely worth a detour."}
{"text":"Nous avons passé un excellent moment dans ce restaurant, le menu degustation est vraiment parfait et vous fait faire un tour du monde des saveurs. Le prix pour ce type de menu 9 plats est vraiment un excellent rapport qualité prix (59$), et l'accord mets et vin coute 30$ de plus pour 4 verres. Je n'ai pas été conquis par les vins, mais par contre rien a redire sur les plats. Les 2 propriétaires sont vraiment sympathique et souhaitent vraiment satisfaire leur clientèle. Mention speciale pour le tajine, le foie gras, et le filet de boeuf (bien que je préfère la purée chaude plutôt que le chaud/froid souhaité par le chef, mais c'est une question de goût). Bref je recommande vivement cet endroit qui gagne à être connu.  Attention le restaurant a été racheté en fin d'année 2015, les commentaires plus anciens n'ont donc pas vraiment de rapport avec le restaurant actuel"}
{"text":"A total gem sitting at the southern edge of the gay village. There aren't enough superlatives to convey how tight this gang of chefs works to bring you downright delicious and inventive stuff, like fish basted in clementine juice and lobster nachos.   To boot, the atmosphere is really breezy and relaxed - there is a minimalist industrial feel to it - completely unpretentious and filled with all ages and strata of Montrealers.  The service is excellent.  Overall one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"My date and I arrived at dusk and were happy with the cozy atmosphere and flattering lighting.  The decor is nice and the service was great.  The food was wonderful as well.  I started with a Japanese taco.  The beef was savoury, tender, and oh-so-yummy.  The hard-shelled was smartly built since the filling was wrapped in lettuce before being placed in the shell.  This was necessary since the taco shell fell apart quite easily!  The \"cheese\" was a nice touch.  I believe it was shredded daikon and carrots.  The fiance had the chicken tortilla tomato soup.  It was scrumptious and had a brilliant kick.  For mains, we opted for the short ribs and the southern fried turkey and waffles.  The short ribs came on a bed of mashed potatoes and green beans, which were drowned in a delicious sauce.  The short ribs were to die for -- succulent and totally tender.  It was the star of the night.  My fried turkey and waffles were a little one-dimensional.  Delicious, yes, but again, it was a little too heavy and lacked complexity, and the blueberries in the waffles lacked acidity.  The mushrooms were in a delicious sauce, however.  Dessert was not to be missed.  We shared the bread pudding, which was made with good quality baguette, large pecans, sultanas (or raisins?), and a whole lot of sinfully good Jack Daniel's sauce.  The portion was so huge that we could barely finish a third of the dessert, so I took it home.  It made the best breakfast the morning after!  We'll definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Dropped in at the last minute for dinner with a friend. All three courses were excellent, and extremely reasonably priced considering the quality of the food.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My husband and I were enjoying a weekend in montreal and were looking for something s different. We were seated early and the service was soso. I asked to Eliminate an egg from an appetizer because of allergies and the waiter said no...not we can try. Service th runout the meal was like they were doing us a favor. I had the stlouis ribs they were so fatty they were in edible. Again, the waiter barely acknowledged what was going on even though he got back a practically full plate. My husband had a seafood stew which was just bland. I would not even stay for dessert.what a disappointment! We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This was our first to Montreal. We made reservations for dinner at Kitchenette after learning about the restaurant on the Cooking channel. It was Weds evening and the waiter confirmed that the menu had changed that day so there were many new items we had not seen from the menu online.       Because it was early we made a dinner of multiple appetizers. Starting with oysters on the half shell and Kitchenette's spectacular version of Oysters Rockefeller, Kitchenette lived up to our expectations. The Herb salad was delightfully fresh with Boston lettuce, fennel leaves (we think,) dill and a light vinaigrette that was simply perfect. In my opinion the Tortilla Soup with Organic Smoked Chicken was the best dish of the night. The aroma of smoke, the sparkle of the chili, and the intense tomato of this soup burst into syncopated harmony as all the Caribbean flavors performed a Latin musical in my mouth. In my opinion this soup should be called the Sunshine Soup-  all I could think of was how happy  each mouthful made me. The grilled Eel Tosada was excellent as was the Japanese Taco with Pulled Teriyaki Beef.     For dessert we had Bread Pudding with Jack Daniels and Caramel Sauce which was superb, if you like really sweet desserts- for us it was a bit too sweet. However, the post dinner espresso coffee was equal to the best we've had outside of Italy ...,(most restaurants don't know how to make good espresso- and believe me, if you want espresso the cutest cups and all the lemon peels and sugar cubes don't  disguise the \"aqua tinta\" passed off as the real thing...)     All in all Kitchenette is a restaurant not to be missed. One caveat- while on Weds the one server could keep up with the patrons, if things get busier I could see service slowing down- however they may have more servers at those times.     Still I'd say, go early, and go with an appetite to try many dishes."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Great food service and ambiance.  Well prepared, creative but not fussy    A real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Right when I thought I couldn't have possibly been in the right neighborhood, Kitchenette pops up on the side of the highway. It's a quiet little restaurant with well-thought out yet simple dishes. What a nice experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. The chef is accessible to all. Welcoming gourmet experience at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The Po' boy sliders are delicious, I would go back just to try them again.  Steak Diane was really good also.  The place has a nice atmosphere also and seemed relatively new.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I found this place to be average at best. While the starter salad was quite delicious, the steak was just run of the mill and the frites were pretty bland.  Service was also lousy.  Yes, they did have two large parties - but those parties didn't just show up out-of-the-blue.  Management really should have been better prepared and not expect the two and four-tops to deal with slow and inattentive service. There are much, much, much better restaurants in the area that have a lot more respect for their clientele."}
{"text":"Calm, relaxing and serene. The perfect spot for a light lunch/brunch with some friends. This was not too far from our hotel on Saint-Catherine. Easy parking, great wait staff -  a true hidden gem in East Montreal."}
{"text":"Une cuisine raffinée, moderne et inventive. Jeremy, et Mathieu aussi gentils que talentueux vous accueillent dans un cadre chaleureux. Une très belle adresse à Montréal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Poor service, mediocre food (most I assume was frozen to start) and generally an unappealing environment.  Apparently, they assume that if you finish your food it was good. In reality, it's overpriced and you're so hungry because of the service to leave \"edible\" food on your plate."}
{"text":"WOW ! Loved my meal last night.  Had the lobster salad which was beautifully infused with fresh citrus ! Amazing ! My steak frites was , perfection. My companion had filet mignon, also PERFECT.  The desserts were wonderful, both the  homemake sorbert with fresh fruit and the sundae. Service was friendly and warm. My only complaint was the actual temperature of the restaurant. A young gentleman at the next table was fanning himself (sign for the staff/owner), when he arose his shirt was literally wet.  It always amazes me on a Friday evening this place isn't packed.  Go one block to St. Catherines with so many average places are packed, and this hidden gem has only a few tables occupied."}
{"text":"Tasty, friendly and fun.  Local crowd, smallish menu, all 4 of us were happy with our meals.  Japanese taco was interesting and yummy, the seared cod with brussel sprouts was ok.  Solid choice if you are in the neighborhood, but if you are after a gastronomic extravaganza suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"terrible food terrible service over priced 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"My last meal in Montreal was FABULOUS! As with all travels, going off the beaten path just a couple blocks gets you cheaper and better food!  Well, the Kitchenette isn't cheap and is a $$$ kind of place, but its classy and worth every Canadian dollar, which right now is 25% off everything if you're American like moi. The hostess and our waiter Matthew were friendly and didn't mind my terrible French.  Interior is simple but beautiful and romantic...so romantic that the couple 2 tables away couldn't keep their hands off each other...oooh la la!    $8 Gazpacho...huge bowl of gazpacho with complex flavors, giving it a unique edge against original Spanish recipes. Great flavor and great value.  $16 Champignons(mushrooms)...thinly sliced portabello mushrooms in a truffle oil sauce with herbs. Probably the best mushroom dish ever?   $38 Lobster tail and Risotto...wife's dinner.  Lobster was kept simple and broiled with some spices and butter(I think). Wife thought it was tad dry, but the sample she gave me was moist and delicious.  The risotto was a creative interpretation in which it was pan fried on each side, making it almost like a flat aracini pasta. The wife loved it.   $44 Terre et Mer, aka Turf and Surf, or Earth and Sea...It was my last meal, so I splurged, and so worth it!  I honestly wasn't sure what cut of beef this was, but the steak was delicious and came with lovely creamy sauce which I think was a combination of whiskey, au jus, peppercorns, and probably some secret spices. Matthew said this was best at Medium Well, and I accepted that.  By American standards, it was more like medium, which is what I like best anyway.  Also came with 4 perfectly cooked and buttery scallops onto of a complementary curry paste that paired well.  And finally, some barley & veggies for a starch, topped with deep fried baby shrimp.  For the equivalent of $33 American dollars, this was a great delicious deal!  $8 Chocolate lava cake...small but rich and delicious!  Bottles of wine start at $35(or $26 American!), so we splurged a bit and opted for a $41 bottle of French red wine...it was perfect!  Afterwards the chef stopped by to introduce himself for some small talk and asked about our meal.   his would never happen in France...I love Quebec!  Nice guy, I wish him the best."}
{"text":"My review is 3.5 with the extra star tacked on due to good service.   I came here with my family not really knowing what to expect. I like the semi-casual ambiance of the restaurant.   We had the option to order the 9 course tasting menu with or without wine pairings, and while I was down, my family wasn't hungry enough so we ordered from their standard menu. To start, we shared the salmon tartare which was delicious and a good portion. All 5 of us were able to have a taste. We also shared a mozzarella + tomato salad (essentially caprese) which, while good, was essentially just a lump of mozzarella surrounded by tomato slices. The presentation could use some work.   For my main I had the seared tuna with foie gras and peas. It was very nicely cooked though I personally could live without the peas :)   My mom had the salmon which had a beautiful presentation under glass. She devoured it so I'm assuming it was good. My husband had the surf and turf with lobster and beef tenderloin. I had some of the lobster and we agreed that something was off about it. We'll stick to New England lobster in the future.   If I came back I'd love to try the 9 course menu. I recommend the seared tuna and salmon entree and salmon tartare app."}
{"text":"I had the 9 course with 4 glasses of wine dinner.  It was terrific, service and food!  The staff was very friendly, and under new owners who really love the location and it's culture.  I look forward to my next visit to Montreal and eating at Kitchenette, again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  I'm from Chicago and we wanted a nice meal so I googled \"where to eat in the village\".   This popped up as first and it we made resos.  We arrived to the restaurant and it's very quaint and comfortable.  Our waiter, Matieu, was phenomenal.   Very attentive and adorable and always smiling.  The food was presented amazingly and was amazingly amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal in the village area of Montreal."}
{"text":"This one isn't easy.   I thought the food was very good. And I found the food very reasonably priced. Main dishes starting from 22$. We were a group of 6 and everyone enjoyed their food. But it's the wine list that was a bummer. It just doesn't match the prices of the food. The vast majority of wine prices were in between 60-100. So I would call it a little pricey. But the trade off is that you're not in an overcrowded restaurant. There was plenty of open space around the tables, which is really nice if you don't want some fat guys ass in your tartar as he squeezes through to his chair.   Overall: Food 4.5 Price 2 Decor 4"}
{"text":"So I went to Kitchenette because we had been told it was amazing. The food was just ok. Nothing special. I had the salmon which was served in a chowder (a really strange combo and that I didn't end up finishing - it's really not how I expected my diner to be... I thought the chowder was on the side) and my husband had the ribs. He told me his ribs tasted too vinger like and his bean were cold. Our service was pretty bad. They gave us the wrong bill, and WE only realized after we paid that this is what happened. It belonged to another table and because it was only $1 difference they didn't seem to care. We went to Kitchenette to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary.... it was a pretty disappointing experience.  We won't be going back.  I always give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, but this experience just wasn't up to bar. Go elsewhere to spend your money."}
{"text":"I found Kitchenette after a long, grueling day of travel (rather, Yelp found it for me) and I am compelled to share my positive experience. the menu was simple but the food was anything but!   after my warm welcome from Matthew (I believe he is the/an owner), I sat at the bar where I was treated to a first hand view of the chef's (perhaps also an owner?) great care in preparing my exquisite meal.   the place is not at all touristic (and I hope its imminent popularity does not compromise this charming quality) and a bit off the beaten path. attention to detail is obvious even in the music selection - great covers of wide-ranging (read eclectic) classics done by unknowns they harvested from YouTube! decor is upscale, clean, and hip.  love it, je reviens!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? It is a beautiful and unpretentious restaurant with lovely art on the walls, and a welcoming staff. I started with raw ahi with ponzu and seaweed salad and it was brilliant. I am a sushi fanatic, so I was really blown away by it. My Lamb shank was made Moroccan style with chick peas and heirloom tomatoes and some Arabic spices that I couldn't figure out, maybe a bit of Harrissa, finished with a touch of honey. Every bite revealed a new layer. It reminded me of a great wine.  I never eat dessert, but the chef came out with a molten dark chocolate cake that had a tart passion fruit sauce. I thought that I would only have a bite, but finished it and almost licked the plate. Their wines by the glass are terrific, and, frankly, under priced. I think that the only reason that this place wasn't completely packed when I went on a Friday night a few weeks ago, is because it's not an easy walking distance from Old Montreal and other tourist hotels. But it is less then a 10 minute cab ride from downtown and Old Montreal. If this restaurant were in Los Angeles, I would be there at least once a week. Foodies! Flock to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We have heard about this place for a while now so we decided to try it on a Friday for lunch. We arrived around 1:30 and the place was still almost full from the lunch hour. But the bar was empty, yay!! We waited quite a while before someone actually spoke to us (greet us). So I am kinda of bummed since I was excited to try this place. And the service stayed like that the entire lunch hour :( So that would be my cons....bad service and the chef is nice but very not talkative, we felt like we were disturbing him, which we probably were but it was not crazy busy. Anyway, I always prefer to hear from the chef himself about what to try so he kinda told us but the waitress was more loud and clear, thank God! On the positive note, the food was awesome!! The ceviche was delicious, very light and tasty. Then we tried the crab beignet (crab cakes) which were fabulous including the \"ranch\" homemade dressing!! MMmmm!!! After this we tried the fish taco and the lobster roll which came with a butter salad and french fries with Mayo. French fries were soft and greasy. The salad was very simple. I was most excited about the piknik table where my lobster roll was served on than anything else :) Seriously, the food was great and I would go back for this. Maybe they just had a bad day for service when I went.....or I am just toooo picky! ;)"}
{"text":"Came to Kitchenette with a large group for a Bachelorette party and man am I glad we did! The food was incredible, the service was delightful, and the ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. The kitchen faces out to the seating area so you can enjoy all the delicious smells as your meal is being prepared. Between everyone in the group, we ordered scallops, tuna, and beef and we all LOVED our dishes.   Besides for the food though, out of all the restaurants we went to during our 4-day trip (so quite a few places), all of which knew that there was a bride-to-be in our group, this was the only place to do something thoughtful for her by dressing up the table and her chair with a disco bar and feathers. They went above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Having moved here from Texas, I wasn't sure about the \"Southern\" label on Kitchenette. Turns out they didn't mean \"down home, authentic Southern,\" they meant \"upscale, chef-driven thoughtful Southern\" which is a-okay. A menu that sounds straight-up heavy is twisted and turned until each piece is a lighter, more complex, tastier version of its inspiration. Lobster roll was the best my wife had ever had anywhere, the chicken-fried beet salad (no, seriously) was fantastic and surprising and while calling what I had for a side \"sweet potato tater tots\" was a bit of a stretch, they were as unique and wonderful as everything else.   Mississippi Mud Pie for dessert was fair but uninspired, service was nice but slow and not very good at keeping track of the room even on a slow Wednesday night. Prices are a bit high but you feel like you know where the money went when you eat."}
{"text":"what a cute \"expensive\" little place...we didnt even take a bottle of wine and it cost us $65.00 each.  We shared a tartar, was ok $12.00 and small...we each had a main meal, cod fish in miso, was ok $26.00 and very small...glass of white wine each $11.00, perfect...and shared a bread pudding $8.00, AMAZING! i had an alonge $3.75. total $112.39+tip i'll go back, but for a coffee and the bread pudding! i didnt understand why its so pricy, i mean the rent cant be all that expensive in that area and the portions are very tiny?  in my opinion, either they should lower their prices or make a little more generous portion..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, wonderful atmosphere and phenomenal service. A must visit of you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly and accommodating service.  We had the tasting menu and enjoyed it.  Very good value.  We really loved the steak filet with truffled gratin potatoes (I'm sure there's a french name for this but I don't know what it is.)   This is an easy walk from the St.Catherine nightlife and I love the location across from the Molson plant and Radio Canada; it feels edgy but still in the middle of everything. Very comfortable and cool place.  I was a longtime fan of the old Kitchenette, under amazing chef Nick Hodges.  This visit to Montreal I learned that the restaurant changed hands in November 2015, bought by a French couple who run the front and back of the house.  There's a new menu of course, which I have yet to explore.  A few other reviews grumble about the change.  But I can say that it's still the same great ambiance.  And the service is now smooth and warm.  So I still recommend it.  Just make sure you read the new menu on their website to make sure it's for you.  The current yelp description \"French, Southern, American\" is no longer accurate."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in our many visits to Montreal. It was a quiet night, so service was simply an amazing level of attentiveness. They were out of the wine we originally wanted and recommended a phenomenal substitute. Appetizers, entrees, and deserts were all over the top good in an intimate environment that reminds me of the many fine village restaurants we used to visit but sadly were lost to the more basic restaurants that populate the village today."}
{"text":"I came to this resto by fluke! We wanted to go to Blossom but there was a lot of people and we would have to wait for a table so we decided to see what other resto was around the area. Kitchenette was a 9 min walk from the resto and I was excited because I love French food. Keep in mind this resto is not cheap!   It was dead! My cousin and I were the only ones in the resto. It's a cute resto decorated with hanging ornaments from the ceiling.   They gave us two kinds of bread... regular and wheat. It reminded me of the square ones from the Keg. So of course I ate it! It was good because it was so warm and it came with three types of butter that they made in-house. One was with herbs, another with olives, and then a regular one. The olive tapenade one was my favorite even though I found an olive seed inside the butter.   The plating was so pretty and fancy!   I got the poached lobster tail with bisque, leeks and risotto. The lobster tail was a decent size. The waiter poured the bisque over the lobster. I wish I had known there was some left after he poured because the sauce was so good and I would have ate it all up. The risotto wasn't your typical risotto. It was more like a crispy risotto cake. I also had the Chablis (white wine) and it was so good! Very light and fruity! Perfect with seafood or just to drink on its own. I will definitely buy this wine at the SAQ!   My cousin had the surf and turf. This consisted of wasabi encrusted red tuna which was half cooked with a piece of foie gras on top. On the side there was a quail egg and a white barley seaweed salad. My cousin liked her main. I had a piece of tuna with foie gras and it was cooked to perfection. The fish almost didn't taste like anything which I like because I like when fish doesn't taste fishy.   This place closes at 9 pm which is pretty early!! We could tell the waiter wanted us out but he was very polite and smiley and didn't kick us out."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! My wife and I came for dinner based on the Yelp reviews and we are so glad that we did! My steak was delicious and so was her short rib! We both agreed that our calamari appetizer was the best calamari that we've ever had. The chocolate soufflé cake was also amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and say this is a world class bistro.  But emotionally prepare yourself, because you're going to pay for it.  This was our biggest fanciest meal of the season, and totally worth it.  I ate this meal literally last October, and I still totally remember it.    The wine and whiskey list is wonderful and thoughtful.  We started with an appetizer that included mushrooms and a soft boiled egg on polenta and we were already besides ourselves.  We also shared a fantastic little green salad.  Then I had a piece of fish that melted in my mouth with expertly prepared veg, and Mark had pork that he literally was getting emotional about (I know, we are the biggest food-loving nerds ever.  Don't you want to hang out with us?  Don't answer that.)  After dinner we went to the bar to have another round and enjoy the cozy atmosphere.  We chatted a little with the chef and just in general felt welcome and comfy.  Love love love love love  About the month or so before we went for the weekend to Montreal Food & Wine did a feature on the city's food scene with the usual suspects like Joe Beef and Au Pied de Cochon, and I think Kitchenette was conspicuously missing.  It definitely stands up to some of the raddest, most interesting food I've had in LA, NYC, SF, and all over Europe (back when I had a glamorous job, before I lost my mind and went back to school.)  So crack your piggy bank and make your reservation."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Montreal for Christmas and when researching restaurants for Christmas Eve dinner this really stood out. All information and reviews I had found talked about the great Southern/Southwest/French/Canadian fusion of the food due to the chef's background being from Texas. As Texans in Quebec, we were really excited for Kitchenette!!   Sadly, no where mentioned that the restaurant was bought out two months ago by a French couple. The menu we were excited about was replaced with a 7 course holiday meal option that didn't share the same excitement as what I had read about.  While the food was decent at best, the evening itself was lacking. They seemed incredibly understaffed, we were told curtly by one waitress when our silverware was on top of our plates that they were trying to conserve dishes and water so if we could keep our fork and knife for every course. The first course of mushroom cream soup was lukewarm at best, the meats (filet mignon and chicken surprise) were overcooked and dry, foie gras was palatable but underwhelming. It took 40 minutes before our water glasses were acknowledged and filled, we had to ask twice for water. The dessert tasted as though it was leftover from last week and topped with a baileys whipped cream to help disguise the stale bite of cake. I don't mind a long dinner but we felt forgotten about several times throughout the 3 hours we were there, with multiple servers asking us where we were in our meals with two dishes coming out of order.   The two things we enjoyed: the asparagus risotto with scallop was fantastic (I don't even like scallops and this one I did) and the tiger shrimp with 5 spice sauce was deliciously creative.   The chefs/owners did both come over to say hello and apologize for the long wait. They comped us a whole shot of espresso for our wait time. That one free $3 sip really made up for missing our carriage ride through Old Montreal before mass at Notre Dame....  I wish I had been able to experience the old Kitchenette raved about in earlier reviews"}
{"text":"We had New Years Eve dinner at Kitchenette and were blown away. The staff were friendly and the food was amazing! They had a 9 course tasting menu which was mainly French but hints of local flavor like the lobster tail with maple braised fennel. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone from couples looking for an intimate night out to a group of friends."}
{"text":"Cute place, great service. The fried chicken sandwich was so moist and delicious, served with amazing sweet potato tater-tots, they just melted in my mouth.  It was so freaking hot outside the waitress said she would make me a special drink,  a bourbon lemonade, it rocked! Don't miss this Kitchenette )"}
{"text":"Wow! De la bonne bouffe BBQ Texane avec une touche de gastronomie qui le rend beaucoup plus appétissante et attirante que les annonces de PFK. Quand j'y suis allée, le focus était vraiment sur les fruits de mer et le homard. J'ai bien aimé le \"nacho tartare\" qui fondait dans la bouche tout en ayant une touche d'épice de chili pour que nos papilles s'en souviennent longtemps. Pour le repas principal, j'ai pris le lapin BBQ mais j'ai aussi eu la chance de goûter à un des poissons, les côtes de porc et le steak. On pourrait dire de tous les plats qu'ils fondaient dans la bouche tellement ils étaient bien apprêtés. Les portions sont très généreuses et je n'avais pas faim pour le dessert, mais puisque c'était ma fête on m'a surprise avec un \"sundae Cracker Jack\" que tout le monde a semblé adorer. Une chance, parce que je n'aurais pas été capable de le terminer toute seule!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Icehouse, Chef Nick Hodge's hip and casual love letter to Southern American food. If it weren't for Blackstrap BBQ's sudden appearance and my frequent visits that border on stalking frequency, it would be my most frequented restaurant of this year. With that in mind, I had never had the opportunity to visit his 1st and more \"upscale\" restaurant Kitchenette. This past Saturday, with the help of a last minute restaurant for a family meal, I succeeded in righting that wrong.  We started off with a half dozen fresh oysters with homemade Tabasco and a tomatillo based mignonette. The oysters were perfectly shucked and the mignonette was a very nice compliment to the freshness of the oysters with the subtle kick from the tomatillos. A good start to the meal.  The subsequent course brought forth 3 different appetizers to try. The Maryland-style crab cakes with ranch dressing were very well executed. Plentiful crab meat with a thin but perfectly crispy exterior. The ranch sauce was also very good and clearly homemade. Had the right richness but without being too fat and thick. Probably the best crab cakes I've had in Montreal.  The Japanese taco with pulled beef teriyaki and daikon-jalapeño slaw was quite good as well. Good strong flavors from the beef which were nicely balanced by the slaw. I only wished there wasn't just one taco in the dish so that I could have had more than one bite.  The final appetizer was the sopapillas with crispy chicken skin, truffle and spiced honey. Never had these fried pastries before but there were pretty good. Really, it is the spiced honey and truffle that comes off as the big flavor in this dish. This was more a dessert in flavour but a nice compliment to the other flavors we got during this course.  With the two mains we ordered (also another order of crab cakes but we'll ignore that for this portion), we also got a side of French fries and a side of Vidalia onion rings. The French fries were of the classic French bistro variety - matchstick style. Absolutely no complaints there - very good. The onion rings, on the other hand, were simply amazing. Nice thick rings of Vidalia onion that maintained a great crispness regardless of the batter which was nice, crispy and not heavy. That really allowed the sweetness of the onion to shine though. Once again, some of the best onion rings I've ever had.  The first main was the lazy cioppino with grilled sourdough bread. I didn't try much of this for reasons that will become obvious in a moment but from what I had, this was a very nice hardy broth with amazing fresh seafood by the tons be it crab, shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels or fish. It all worked perfectly well together and with the sourdough bread, it made for a perfect bread dunking opportunity into the broth. Definitely will want to try this myself in more detail next time I visit.  Now, I did not try much of the cioppino because I ordered the Chicken-fried duck confit, sweet potato and wild blueberry waffle, white gravy and pickled mushrooms. This was an overall wonderful play on the chicken and waffle combination. The duck confit was spectacular. There really is no other way to describe that beautiful piece of duck I received. Great flavor, great texture. Spot on in every way and that is before you consider the chicken-fried preparation on top of it. The gravy was nice and rich and the mushrooms were a very nice compliment to the overall rich nature of this dish. The one disappointment was the waffle which, while having a nice flavor of blueberry, was too soft in texture for my liking. I assume that may have been on account of the gravy it soaked in but it still wasn't what I was hoping for. A little crisper and this was a perfect dish.  After all of that food, you figured we were done, right? Well, you'd be wrong. To finish this off, we ordered the bread pudding with Jack Daniel's and toasted pecan caramel. Oh the bread pudding.... where to start with this beauty... This was simply the best bread pudding I have ever had and I honestly don't think it will ever be topped. The bread itself was nice, soft and able to absorb all of that delicious caramel sauce to make it even that much better. The caramel sauce was to die for and not just because of how rich it was. You got just the right taste of Jack Daniels and the toasted pecans added a nice crunch to the gooey rich mess that is this dessert. I felt like I wanted to explode afterwards but it was completely worth it in every way.  I had high expectations for Kitchenette and there were ably met by Chef Hodge and his team. This is a restaurant I will come back to because I now have the desire to eat very thing on the menu. I believe that, more than anything, speaks to the quality of the food you can experience at Kitchenette. This is a place not to be missed.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Cute, unassuming restaurant, with stellar food. Waitress was a bit busy and overwhelmed, but the food more than made up for the sometimes slow service. Elevates Southern cooking to haute cuisine."}
