{"text":"I used to have the empanadas served here back when it was the owner selling them from a small mobile shop. The restaurant has grown but the food has remained uniformly excellent. Delicious, filling, inexpensive and a fun atmosphere.   I just took my mother here, visiting from Michigan. She's says: \"minimal setting ad frills, and just really, really great food.\""}
{"text":"Fantastic. Stopped in hoping to find some authentic Argentine cuisine.  Food was terrific. Service was excellent. Empanadas to die for. The El Capitan, chicken, & pork were outstanding. Try the banana & nutella desert empanada. Killer! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Empanadas are delicious! A little pricey but good!  We ordered a total of 9 and three waters and it came out to about 45 bucks"}
{"text":"My friend and I were hungry last night but didn't know what we wanted or where to go so we pulled up Yelp. Yep, we found this place because we like new places that are off the beaten path. We were not disappointed!!  The atmosphere is inviting, the service is personal and the food is AMAZING!! Simple ingredients done right!! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! What a cool concept. Wide variety of empanadas, all were very good. Our waiter was very helpful and service was excellent. I highly recommend the dessert empanadas."}
{"text":"The empanadas are ok, a lil over priced for what they are, location is probably not the greatest....its like a hole in the wall type of place with over priced empanadas....not sure if I would go back"}
{"text":"Great simple menu. Great pricing. Had the lunch special today with my husband and it was super good. The rice and beans were very tasty. My usual pet peeve about empanadas is that they are either too greasy, too doughy, or the insides are greasy and tasteless. Soooo not the case here. I had the potato and the cheese one and both were very tasty, not greasy, and not doughy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service, great staff.  Only complaint is the kitchen is pretty slow."}
{"text":"There were high expectations for this cute, little Mesa restaurant given the high Yelp rating. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.   The yucca fries were mostly DRY; the dipping sauce was tasty, but not enough to carry the dish. I had yucca fries many times in DC, and I was hoping that these too would be crunchy on the outside and soft/moist on the inside. These fries, not so much.   The empanadas were incredibly hot, too hot. Made me wonder if they were microwaved. Also, the \"El Capitan,\" similar to an Argentinean empanada, left much to be desired. The meat looked and felt puréed and was quite watery. It didn't taste meaty and substantial-- like a savory empanada should.   The Greek empanada was not balanced at all; the spinach, sun dried tomatoes and feta were all separated. Alone, these ingredients were at times bland (spinach) and at times overpowering (sun dried tomatoes). Not sure why they weren't mixed together.  We decided to get two dessert empanadas to go; we really wanted to have good things to say about the restaurant. The fig and dulce de leche empanada was absolutely delicious and definitely the best thing we tried. However, despite ordering the Nutella and banana empanada, we received a peanut butter and banana empanada. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. Who wants the bitter, thick taste of peanut butter when you are anticipating rich Nutella? I looked at the little paper envelope it came in and it said Nutella. Someone put the wrong empanada in the Nutella wrapping. Thankfully neither of us is allergic to peanuts, but such a mistake could land someone in the hospital. I called the restaurant to let them know the empanada was marked wrong and the young lady on the phone said she would pass on the information. An apology and offer to give me a credit for my next visit would've been nice, but that's okay. Let's face it, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very solid option to try something different. Their specialty is empanadas and they do it well. I tried the PERNIL and the Ham and cheese from their lunch special which is a very good value because it is essentially a platter. But for a few dollars more you might to try one of their \"platter\" which includes fried plantains which are just delicious.  Good ambiance, friendly staff, clean restrooms, cozy place.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I will be telling all my friends that they MUST try this place. My son and I popped in for a late dinner last night and we will be back soon (maybe today? lol). Ordered the combo caribe, and we each had an empanada platter with the boricua and jalapeno popper potato empanadas. Everything is so fresh, quaint but upbeat and fun environment with good music playing, and super friendly staff and owner! I ordered a couple to-go empanadas for the hubby and he was equally impressed - they baked up perfectly crispy in the oven. Don't skip the combo - their black beans are seriously awesome, and the rice is so fluffy!"}
{"text":"Republica Empananda has the best Empanada's that I have been able to find any where in the states! This is a family run business with the owner and his family working there daily to create delicious homemade,  from scratch empanada's, salads, and beverages. I ordered the Hearts of Palm salad that had a Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette dressing that was to die for. The salad was quite large and could easily feed one person for lunch. I opted to split it as an app with my friend so that we could both sample some empanada's as well (they're in the name after all, so they have to be good, right?) We also split the Jalapeño Popper Empanada and the Cubana Empanada. Both were A-MAZING. The Jalapeño was filled with grilled jalapeño, potatoes,  and cream cheese. The Cubana was delicious chunks of ham, pickles, and mozzarella. Both were quite scrumptious and I would be hard pressed to say that I had a favorite out of the two. The crusts on both were light, buttery, and flaky, not heavy at all, and added to the over all experience. 10 out of 10 would recommend everything I had and I will be looking forward to going back to explore the rest of their menu.   The entire staff was very personable and friendly, the dining area and kitchen were clean and aesthetically pleasing, and they even have a cute, well shaded patio (for cooler months) that backs up to a nice community garden.   This is a little drive from the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, but well worth the time and gas to get there."}
{"text":"I came to this place with mi mama and siblings because my sister, god bless her, decided to branch away from her traditional corporate franchise restaurants and found this new spot.   I'm a fat boy stuck in a struggling skinny man body and ordered combo caribe to share and then 4 empanadas, beer and black beans for myself.   The yuca was amazing, love the sauce. I liked the republica chicken and the bean & cheese empanadas. The other one I tried was mushroom chicken, but it wasn't as savory as the republica. Sorry, I can't report on the pork ones, but the fam really liked them. I wish there was a \"Gordo Platter\" with 4 empanadas and sides, but I digress.   They had a really good coconut porter beer that I highly recommend. I also recommend they should get this on tap because I want a pint of it. They carry delicious Hispanic sodas. Yay!  The atmosphere was a little weird. It's tough to explain. It's like maybe the music can be turned up some or add couple more tvs and make it more rambunctious. It's quick and cheap food I kind of wanted it to be a bit more in my face. Maybe a couple more TVs and beer on tap. Just throwin my two cents. The place was clean and lay out was hipster cool.  The wait staff was exceptional. They explained to us the sizes of empanadas, what they recommend and pairing up with some good beer. Kudos waitress."}
{"text":"Walking into RE you are greeted with a nice clean dining room with tasteful art and a slight industrial theme (the light bulbs are pretty cool). The empanada's are very tasteful, although I would like to see some more onion in the cheeseburger empanada. I also tried the El Capitan, Mushroom Chicken, and Jalapeno Popper; all were VERY good!  The staff was very friendly and the service was excellent. If you are looking for a nice lunch in a good atmosphere, visit Republica Empanada. I plan on going back and trying a few more empanada flavors along with their yummy house green salsa."}
{"text":"Service can be a bit flaky--there were only two servers on when I got there (6:30 on a Saturday) and it took a long time for anyone to help me/the staff seemed overwhelmed. I still love this place, just some info for the powers that be."}
{"text":"Very good. A bit on the pricy side.... I did enjoy the food very much.   service was a bit slow. The price and wait for the food is the reason behind the 4 stars.  I won't be back only because it's not much food for the price and I have 5 people to feed. Empanadas are small and for 1 to be over 3$ is ruff plus there are no sides.. All extra$ but again very very good!"}
{"text":"went with my husband last nite for date nite & we had a wonderful time. the staff was helpful & friendly. we tried a a variety of the empanada flavors & they were all great not a bad one they were all crisp & flavorful.the dessert ones were heaven. all in all it was a great restaurant, layed back vibe you have to try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very tasty empanadas! We got the fig cheese caramel dessert empanada, and it was awesome! Our favorite savory empanada was the bean and cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing find!  Almost didn't come because I am not an Empanada huge fan but decided to anyway, got the Chicken Torta sand which, they were cool enough to throw in some sweet plantains in the sandwich when I requested it and I must say, thank you!  One of my new favorite meals.  Also shout out to amazing customer service from Chad who was super cool and friendly.  The atmosphere is clean and cool."}
{"text":"In town from Chicago and unfortunately flying back tonight. We just stopped at Republica Empenada and can honestly say it's one of the best things I've ever had. We will be back....next year."}
{"text":"Small Restaurant...great food and beer.  Asked the waiter to bring me 4 empanadas of his choice.  They where all delicious, fresh and filling.  Beer selection touts local faire.  Give it a go...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special, absolutely terrific food, wonderful flavor! Looking forward to coming back many more times to try the other options and desserts."}
{"text":"I recently heard of this empanada restaurant and I just had to make sure I would go and try it out.  I lived in South America for 2 years and empanadas was a food that I ate just about every day down there.  At the Republica Empanada, I ordered the ham and cheese, buffalo chicken, and the beef (El Capitan).  The ham and cheese and the El Capitan were very good and they tasted pretty much like the ones I ate in Paraguay.  I was not impressed with the buffalo chicken empanada.  I love buffalo wings, but this empanada did not have the \"buffalo\" flavor that I was expecting.  They used gorgonzola in the buffalo chicken empanada, so that may be the reason I could not taste and \"buffalo\" flavor.  We also ordered yuca frita (fried yuca) with was good.  In Paraguay, you pretty much have mandioca (yuca, cassava) with every meal you eat.  It was nice to eat yuca frita again.  If you like empanadas, give this place a try, it is good."}
{"text":"Delicious  food, amazing latin American tastes. Yucca frita was amazing... reminded me of home . So good to be able to present some of my comfort foods to my friends. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Went for lunch and they had an awesome lunch special; 2 empanadas, cabbage salad, rice and beans.  The service was very welcoming, I felt like I walked into a friends home, it was very clean, and had 2 large screen TV's. The food was absolutely delicious. We got 4 different empanadas ALL were yummy!!!  We will be back and I highly suggest your check it out too."}
{"text":"This was a \"stumble in\" experience as I had a business meeting in the area.  What a find!  Wonderful smells and a great beer list made me call it quits for the day and unwind with a spirit and a delicious meal.  The pollo con arroz is highly recommended!  Special kudos to the friendly staff who appear to go above and beyond for each person who walks in the door.  Four stars for location (not the best), but the fare and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Cons: I am a fan of spices. In all honesty, I did not really taste a lot of spice in any of the dishes I tried today. I also thought the empanada's were a bit on the small side. Finally, I was not a big fan of the  ham. Seemed more like farmer john boiled ham in cubes then a real smoked or cured ham. Don't get me wrong it tasted good, but if I wanted lunch meat I would have got a sandwich.   Pro's Some of the nicest people I have met. The girl that waited on me was respectfully dressed. She was kind, courteous, and more than willing to go over everything on the menu and make recommendations. There was a gentleman on a laptop that introduced himself to me, shook my hand, and thanked me for coming in.  There was a slightly older gentleman that held the door open for me, and everyone thanked me for coming in and asked me to come again as I left. Finally, the food is very reasonably priced.   Food- Now as i said before in my opinion, I though the empanadas themselves were a bit on the small side. However, they are budgeted for their size. So don't walk in thinking 1 or 2 is probably going to feed you if you have a big appetite. I came in with the attitude of  the empanadas would be the size of a cornish pasty. When I saw the price I was like wow this is going to be a great deal.  It ended up being a fair deal.  Their pork is pretty decent. Their black bean and cheese was really good, their cubana which is pork, ham, cheese. I was slightly disappointed because again what I expected was not what I got. I figured it would be a shaved smoked or a cured ham.  The sides I got were black beans and rice.  Plus a cabbage salad.   All fairly decent, nothing to right home about.   Final thoughts- Spice it up, maybe try a different type of ham and don't be afraid to tell people empanada's are hand sized. It's the only thing keeping me from giving five stars. In all honesty, I probably would have given three stars on the food because nothing stuck out as great or terrible. What really makes this place though are the people. I am glad I met them today. It's nice to see more places coming to downtown mesa and more business owners need to take a tip from these folks and appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly staff. I would totally go back if I heard that they found a way to get the food out quicker.  That said, both times I have been there the food took exceptionally long to arrive- like 45 minutes to an hour. We actually had to leave part of our party behind because they ordered dessert (and had been waiting 20+ minutes) and the rest of us had to go."}
{"text":"I ate at Republica Empanada before and loved it, so I went back. They must have had an off night because my second experience was horrible. We asked for the first available table inside or outside. We waited about thirty minutes and they sat us inside, meanwhile a table had been open outside the entire time. It was very loud indoors, so we asked for the table outside. The hostess called for help to wipe off the table outside. (Does it take an army to wipe a table?) We were seated and we ordered. The food did not arrive for about 45 minutes to an hour. During that time, we experienced four staff members including our waiter, continuing to ask us if we needed anything. It was obvious that they were trying to tend to our needs but without our meals, there was not much that could be done. So the repeated questions about our well being became more of an annoyance.  On top of this, there was an irritating music mix that was playing that was blasting onto the back patio. It was a blend of Lady Gaga meets South Park. Don't know where they found that music but it was a mood killer.  Our meals finally arrived and then the repeated questions about how the meal tasted continued. Then, the owner came out and asked us if we were well and he inquired as to whether the waiter told us about the specials. Our waiter did not inform us of the specials but we were indifferent to that fact. He seemed concerned about it and seemed he went in the back and may have reprimanded his staff for this.  The owner continued to service us, talking up the desserts and clearing away our plates. What happened to our waiter? Dessert was served and it was incorrect. The owner came back and apologized and corrected it. Our bill came, nothing was discounted for the inconvenience of waiting so long or the mistakes. Then we waited another 20 minutes until our waiter came back to take the bill again. Wow. This was getting old.  After paying, we slipped out the back exit, kind of over the experience and feeling icky from the awkwardness of it all. Won't be back there for awhile even if the empanadas are tasty."}
{"text":"Finally made it here. Been trying to get here since they opened. Was so good. Chicken and mushroom, El Capitan, Cubano and Greek. ALL delish. Hot crispy and fresh. Black beans and rice were nice with their salsa. The cabbage slaw was crazy salty So I ate it with the rice and beans. Spend the extra $6.50 and get the fried plantains. So good with the cream dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I give a 5 however these empanadas are amazing, at least the ones I ordered! I had the jalapeño popper, la boricua, fig cheese and caramel, Nutella and banana and Cubana.  Very friendly staff.  Fast service and VERY affordable.  I would have gotten 1 of each if I could.  Great selections."}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of service and selection. Years go by and I still love to pop in for ANYTHING on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, loved the combination plate and the empanada platter. The service was great and the place was very clean.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Overall the night went very well the moment we walked in. Our waitress was very kind, happy, and helpful. I ordered the Hawaiian and for dessert the Nutella & Banana   they were to good to just have one so i ordered two more :)"}
{"text":"The most delicious food, hot fresh and well made. Friendly service, very clean restaurant, never fails in any way. Eaten here 5 times, and keep coming back. Try the El Capitan, and the sweet plantains! Highly recommended for both."}
{"text":"Just came for the first time and I am beyond satisfied. Everything was amazing and at reasonable prices. The Greek empanada and the Fig, cheese, caramel are the best tasting empanadas I have ever had and I am Puerto Rican, I've eaten many empanadas in my time. Service was great and the place is very clean. Even met the owner who was nice and attentive.   This is must try! We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Had the yuca frita and tostones with homemade green salsa for starters and they were sooo good!  The vegan platter with Achiote potato empanada and black beans empanada had delicious, crispy and non-greasy crust - clearly this place has the best empanada in AZ"}
{"text":"Excellent empanadas!! Can be a little pricey but it is certainly worth it when you try them! Their dipping sauces are great too!:):)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Traveling from out of town and discovered this place on Yelp. Absolutely wonderful atmosphere and food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas!  I've tried 4 different flavors and enjoyed them all.  I think the chicken is still my favorite.  So happy to have another good restaurant option downtown."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a treat!  Great prices. Tasty savory empanadas, cheeseburger was a sure delight to my 4 year old and I devoured the greek!  Hearts of Palm salad was a huge portion with fresh, yummy avocado, kale, tomatoes, romaine and more paired with a delicious lime dressing.  Finished it off with the fig, cheese, carmel empanada, was simply divine.  I will be back again and again and can't wait till they open their bar! Such a unique spot, with local artists on the walls and a stunning mural, this place is not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. I've been three times now and have had the chance to try several offerings and haven't been disappointed yet. They have a great range of  flavors, both savory and sweet. The lunch special is a great deal too. Just be careful, I have burned my mouth every time I've eaten here."}
{"text":"The Boricua, which features pork, rice, and peas, was awesome and definitely out of the 5 or so I tried the one I would recommend. It almost reminded me of a pork chimichanga without all the sauce to make it soggy. There was cheese inside mine that could have been melted, but dipping it in the jalepeno sauce they provide kept it crispy for each bite and delicious. For desert I got a banana cream empanada, which I don't see on their menu, but it was just bananas on the inside with whip cream and a great vanilla ice cream and a slight Hershey's drizzle. Definitely my favorite way to do a banana desert, which usually would never choose but this was amazing. I thought I would only have a few bites and instead ate it all. The only con is I would say the ambiance needs improvement, perhaps a remodel. We came at night and although there were only three people inside the acoustic echoing made it extremely loud. It was also dark and dingy and very narrow and cramped. No one was around although it said to wait to be seated so we had to flag down someone in the back after waiting awhile. Overall, great food if you liked kind of fried dumpling (more unhealthy stuff), but at night at least it gives the impression of a hole-in-the-wall type place. I'll definitely likely be back to pick up quick food in the area because it's cooked really fast."}
{"text":"Not unlike its namesake, this joint has an unassuming exterior and pure delight on the inside. Stopped in here for a late lunch during a business trip, and as with nearly all other Yelpers, the food and service did not disappoint. There are three shared-seating areas (2 small bars and and long community table). There are several small 2-person tables and a couple larger tables. Decor was pleasant with a down-to-earth-but-hip, urban vibe. Very casual atmosphere. Not fancy, just fun.  Lunch: I dined with two business colleagues, and we enjoyed everything we tried. We started with an appetizer Combo Caribe (yuca fries, tostones, and maduro). The accompanying jalapeno-crema and the light green-chile salsa were pleasantly spicy and delicious. I ordered the Lunch Special, opting for the Pernil (slow-roasted pork) and Ham and Cheese empandas which were served with rice, black beans, and cabbage salad ($7.95). I think anything would be delicious wrapped in that perfect pastry crust, so it was especially nice that the fillings were also spectacular. The cabbage salad was simply dressed with a light acidity, proving an especially nice foil for the rich pastry. My colleagues each ordered a special \"Arroz con Colombia,\" which they devoured, echoing high praise between mouthfuls, stopping only to swallow and eat more. They may have breathed; not sure. Sadly for me, they didn't share! This tasty-looking dish was an achiote-seasoned rice served with shrimp, sausage, and vegetables (peppers, carrots). It looked like paella (without the crisped rice bottom). Taking their word and empty plates, it must be fantastic.  To accompany the meal there was a small, thoughtful selection of bottled beers, cider, and sodas. We finished our delightful lunch by splitting the guava and the fig-caramel dessert empanadas (yes, I'm nicer than the boys!). Fig-caramel was amazing, with just a touch of salt (maybe from the cheese?) to balance the sweet caramel and I adored the just-right textures of crispy-chewy-creamy. Mmm.  When I return, the Pernil and Fig-Caramel will remain a must-order. I will venture into other savory flavors and report back."}
{"text":"We tried 6 different empanadas and everything was excellent! Service was good and food was awesome!  We will definitely come back. The fig cheese and caramel desert empanada was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Best Latin Food! I've been there quite a few times now since I work close By. Their menu has a variety of Latin Food and every Dish I've tried has been tasty and fresh made.  My kids love their rice & Beans. The Empanadas are not Greasy and they have at least 8 different kinds to choose from. I got Addicted to the Sweet Empanadas :) There are also Healthy options my favorite is the Black Bean Salad made with Fresh veggies, Black Beans & Avocados. Their Sauce & Dressing are homemade. RE has an Industrial/Moderm Style & Their staff is very Friendly. For all this reasons I just simply Love this Place."}
{"text":"This place is on point!! The customer service was great and they even had a little scooter for the toddler to roll around on! The fries are very similar to the fries at Wilderness Brewing Co. I had the Pernil, Boricua and Greek...all good! The 10 year old said the Hawaiian was really good too. Everyone loved the banana Nutella! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with my mom and we LOVED it! We split a \"Lunch special\" which costs $7.95 and comes with two empanadas, rice, black beans and cabbage salad. We also got two different empanadas à la carte. We tried the Boricua, Pernil, Cubana, and Salted Ham Popper empanadas. We LOVED the Pernil and the Popper, liked the Boricua, and wasn't impressed with the Cubana. The rice and black beans were both good but we thought the cabbage salad was salty. We also tried the Maduros as an appetizer and they were the show stopper! Absolutely a must get if you've never had sweet plantains before. To finish off the meal we tried one of their sweet empanadas, the Dizzy Fig. It has local Mesa figs, mozzarella and dulce de leche. I found it to be a little too sweet, but my mom thought it was delicious.  Overall this place is a diamond and I will be a frequent future customer."}
{"text":"One of my husband's favorite places! It is a little pricey for what you get, especially if you are trying to feed the little, but it is super yummy."}
{"text":"Costa Rica food with South American flavor. It is a small fast food set up but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Any other day I would give this place 5 stars. I've been here a handful of times and the food is always delicious and I love seeing the owner talking to everyone! However, the service has been declining and tonight was just the end of it for me. I was bragging up and down about this place to my boyfriend and when I brought him in no one greeted us. When I asked for a seat (in a nearly empty room) she told told me no and that I had to wait. We then waited ten minutes after setting down our menus to be greeted by our waitress. Our food order was then forgotten. Simply said, I'm embarrassed that I brought anyone here."}
{"text":"Yummy food in a cute little setting!  I look forward to returning again soon.  Definitely a great addition to downtown Mesa and the Mesa Arts Center area."}
{"text":"I mean... the empanadas are ok but portion wise...ehh. We started off with the combo , which had plantains, tostones and yucca fries. I regret getting it because they only give you 3 tiny pieces of each and it was about $9 itself. Just 3 yucca fries????   I hope the owner reads this post and clarifies in a reply that it was a mistake and there should have been more to it... seriously... PLEASE tell me it was a mistake. It'll help soften the fact that I was shafted for just 6 pieces of fried banana and 3 fries, all for $9. Seriously???... The accompanying cilantro aioli was pretty good though, I cleaned that little container of sauce up to the last drop!   The empanadas were ok, I got the pernil and boricua. But again, it comes down to price. At nearly $4 an empanada you would expect something bigger. At the end, we spent $30 for me and my wife (just water for drinks) and left hungry...   I came here because of that Guy Fieri hype... turns out it was just hype... the interior looks pretty cool.. I would describe it like an urban Latino hipster kinda feel... sprinkled with a couple of flies buzzing around bugging you while you try to enjoy your 3 yucca fries...  I believe you should try anything atleast once, but it looks like it's gonna stay at just once for this place    ATTN Owner: please tell me it was supposed to be more than just 3 yucca fries"}
{"text":"Second time I have been here and the staff and food always impress. Had 5 different empanadas tonight, which were: Cubana, Bean and Cheese, Republica chicken, Jalapeño potato popper and apple cinnamon as a desert empanada. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors. They even have a nice selection of vegetarian options as well. Would visit again."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to RE. I crave their bean and cheese Empanadas and yuca fries literally everyday! I also love their platter that has the various plantains and yuca! Great design too, a gem in downtown mesa :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff was great! Hands down the best green salsa we've ever had. We hope to go back before we leave!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a dog friendly restaurant and called up Republica Empanada and they let us bring him out on the patio with us. A good start  Their Tostones were very, very good. Large and enough for 3-4 people to start.  We decided to all try a few and share, everything was great. The Cuban was tasty and the Capitan was particularly good. The house Pork was also amazing.  We will be back, we are always looking for good spots to eat. Prices aren't too bad when you consider the flavor!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Great dough and fillings were yummy. Price is great too. Will definitely come back to and leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I have been for lunch and dinner. If you save room for dessert their Nutella Empanada is so good."}
{"text":"A very cool restaurant in downtown Mesa!  We tried several of the empanadas and loved all of them. Great staff, nice location next to the community garden. This is definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"The Empanadas here are amazing!!! I tried the Pernil and the Greek. The service was friendly and fast! If you are ever in the area make sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Republica Empanada many, many times. I absolutely love the food and have brought family and friends on several occasions. My favorite dishes are the gallo pinto, vegan platter, achiote potato, bean and cheese and the Greek empanadas.   Sadly, the amount of times that I have had satisfactory service when visiting this delicious establishment has been close to none. I must be a glutton for punishment, because I keep going back!  Our last visit has caused me to reevaluate my patronage to a place that does not, it seems, value their customers. We were seated and neglected for more than 20 minutes while the waiters and waitresses schmoozed their friends at the bar table in the middle of the room. They continually walked around, chatting, but did not attend to us. We finally got so frustrated that we just walked out. While I love the food, I will not be visiting R.E. again."}
{"text":"Wow!  Tried several of the empanadas.  All delicious, including the sweet ones.  Give this local business a try.  Great flavors, great service too."}
{"text":"Meh, not impressed and kind of over-priced for what you get. Ordered two different empanadas and the pozole. One of the empanadas was way over done and the other was just right which was of course the one that came with beans in it which I didn't like but was recommended. The pozole was beef and reminiscent of canned beef vegetable soup. Overall expected better, but may try them again."}
{"text":"The variety of these tasty pies is amazing!  The space is so very limited for seating.  And parking is also premium for sure.  Service was good and food was very tasty!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this little place near downtown Mesa. It's very low key and a very laid back ambiance. They were showing Raising Arizona on the TV. Nice touch btw! Food was very good. The Pernil is very comparable to the PR food we had available to us in Chicago. I would definitely comeback to this little gem. If you want a decked out place to the 9's, this isn't for you. If you just want to chill and have some good tasting empanadas and kick back with some friends, this is the place to be. Nice job Republica Empanada!"}
{"text":"Three years wasn't long enough. I went with a friend after a show downtown. I tried this place shortly after it opened 3 years ago, hoping it would be better now since they've been open a while. Let's start with the service. All I can say is attitude, attitude, attitude. They got our order wrong and when I kindly told the waitress I got an obvious eye roll and total attitude the rest of the time. Not to mention how loooooooong everything took. It wasn't even that busy.  Last time the empanada \"shell\" tasted like rancid oil. This time the \"shell\" tasted fine but there was just no flavor. I've heard their dessert empanadas are the best thing they make, however it took so long to get our correct dinner order we gave up on even ordering dessert. Maybe I'll try again in another three years.....if their still open."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but a hidden gem. I've tried every empanada here. They range from traditional to modern. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food, reasonably priced. Seems like the owners are always here making everyone feel like family. The pumpkin empanada was delicious. Cheeseburger empanada also did not disappoint. Nice to see a family business in downtown Mesa giving it a go."}
{"text":"Only the word amazing comes to mind. The Yucca Frita was some of the best I've had, and I've been eating it all my life. The jalapeño popper empanada is delicious and creamy! The service was excellent. They even changed the channel so my baseball obsessed 3 year old could watch the game. We will be back, and will be bringing friends!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We went with a big group and they took really good care of all of us. They are not big portions but the food is very filling. Really enjoyed it especially since a lot of us are vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Bold flavor in simple, fried pockets. If you are anywhere near the Mesa area just do yourself a favor and drag your ass to this place.  The maduros are tender and sweet,  the boricua will make any Nuyorican proud, and the capitan is savory and balanced.  By the time you get to dessert you may be jaded from the empanada concept (I was). But they make a great effort in maintaining their identity till the last bite. I would have preferred a custard or bread pudding... something to mix up the texture."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. If it weren't for a recommendation from a friend, I would have never known about it. I had the Black Bean Popper Empanada, Pumpkin Empanada, and Cubano. They were all great. I also love the atmosphere. Very authentic and FUN."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Some of my faves: arroz con pollo, pernil, el capitán, and my #1 guava and cheese! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was yummy, and it's cute little place. Pozole was good, I would have it again... there was plenty to share with hubby. Also, had a few empanadas--the jalapeño potato, boricua, pernil, the Nutella banana and guava cheese. We enjoyed the meal-- prices are a little high for the size of the empanadas but I would definitely return. My favorite were the Maduros! I would go back just for these!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a lunch place and my phone app suggested this place, I couldn't be more in love with my phone for suggesting it. It is a very small an unassuming place on the outside and you would miss it if you weren't looking for it. The wait staff was very friendly and very informative, our waitress made sure to ask if it was our first time and answered any questions we had. The food was amazing! I would put down what we had, but I think you should go in not knowing and have an amazing experience like we had. I will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"This place was great had lunch here had the hawaiin and the jalapeno popper enpanada and they were great. The decorations are cool and modern. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Oh hell yes!  I was exposed to empanadas during my time in Chile.  This place is a godsend.  Cool locale, nice people, and great sangria and food.  We have had almost all flavors on the savory side and they are all very good.  They cheeseburger flavor was a wonderful surprise.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Right next to my job, super convenient for lunch. The lunch special is a lot of food for a good price. There are so many flavors, I can't keep track of my favorites. I just know the green sauce is amazing with all of them. And be sure to try the fig cheese & caramel dessert, ah-mazing."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything that's bad. Things seem to taste best when the owner is there. Anytime he's not the arroz con pollo isn't the same."}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is a treasure in Mesa! It is crazy to say that even their fries (Papas Fritas) are amazing! There seasonal Soups are to die for! So fresh and warming, the Sopa Verde should be on the menu year round! I don't care if it is 120 degrees outside in the summer, I want my Sopa Verde! Hearts of Palm & Avocado Salad, amazing! Arroz Con Pollo, are you kidding me, how can rice take this good, AMAZING! And they have tortas with the Papas Fritas, WHAT!? Have you noticed I haven't even mentioned the empanadas?  It's because that is a no-brainier!  You are not going to find better empanadas in Arizona, PERIOD!  They have a nice courtyard, not to mention the beautiful Mesa Urban Garden right next door! If you haven't been here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!"}
{"text":"We compare all empenadas to The Empenada Man in Lake Forest, CA and the empenadas here at Republica are good but just don't compare to those softer, tastier empenadas over in the OC.  But the pernil torta was fantastic...one of the best sandwiches we've had since moving here 5 years ago."}
{"text":"Super yummy! (Even my difficult to please boyfriend couldn't stop raving about his empanadas!)  One of the highlights of my visit to AZ!"}
{"text":"I've been to Republica Empanada several times and each time it's a delight! I love this quaint restaurant located in the heart of downtown Mesa. I also love the prices! Seriously, when most restaurants overprice their meals, RE keeps the prices reasonable. The interior is perfect, modern, and clean. Also, the owners are always available to speak to and I love the family-owned atmosphere. You can't go wrong here! I love everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Great ambiance. Knocked my expectations out of the park--and I know empanadas.  I lived in Buenos Ares for a few years. This place hits that spot and takes me back there. Nice shells, they hold everything inside, the inner filling is perfectly moist and tasty."}
{"text":"Freakin' great empanadas!  Sampled 3 different empanadas, and they were magnificas!  Would like to see autentico Mexican natural water beverages (jamaica, agua de coco, horchata, etc.)."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new with my husband and sister so we thought this would be something fun to do.  We went with the intent to try one of everything and we did, empanadas that is.  We ordered one of every empanada, main meal and dessert, a total of 22 empanadas in all.  Each one was split equally 3 ways and we reviewed them all as we ate.      Service We were happy with our server and other personnel as well.  Our waitress was nice, informative, and on the ball.  We were also visited by another waitress making sure we were taken care of and visited by what we think was the owner or manager. All very friendly.   Location  It's a small place but clean, fun, and eclectic.  It's a little off the beaten path but completely worth it.  Empanadas  When you first sit down there is a small container of green salsa at your place.  This salsa was delicious and works well with some of the empanadas.  When the food is delivered each empanada comes out in its own bag, labeled so you know which one you're eating.  All the empanadas had a wonderfully flaky crust and although it was fried, did not taste greasy at all.  They were all very flavorful, not dry, and filled with good quality ingredients.  Any meat that was added was juicy, tender, and flavorful.  Not too large and an average person could eat 2-4 for a meal.  Republica Chicken - The chicken was flavorful and juicy.  Didn't notice the vegetables but they weren't missed because the flavors gave this one a 5 star. Achiote Potato - This empanada did not have much dimension to it.  It was just full of under seasoned potato, a good potato, but just potato.  While it didn't taste bad we would not order it again and received a 1 star.   Bean & Cheese - The black beans were cooked well and the mozzarella gave it a nice creamy texture.  It was a nice blend of flavors and received a 4 star.  Ham & Cheese - Very cheesy with good ham, moist and flavorful.  It was a little on the simple side with the flavors but good ingredients. 3 stars. Cheese - Lots of cheese.  The asiago gave a nice flavor to the mozerella.  While good on it's own, it is excellent with the green salsa given at the table. 4 stars. Pernil - This one was so good!  The pork was juicy, flavorful, tender, and just all around melt in your mouth goodness. 5 stars! Boricua - While the pork is good on its own it worked well with the combination of these other ingredients.  The rice mixture really added a whole new depth to it making it feel more like a complete meal. 5 stars El Capitan - Because of the complexity of the ingredients and splitting it three ways it is a little hard reviewing this one.  While one person got strong olive taste another really tasted the egg.  This one may have tasted better by one person but it just didn't seem to work for us. 2 star The buffalo - Was not available so can not review Cubana - We are a little torn on this one.  While one of us loved it the others found it jus okay.  This can probably be attributed to the dill pickle, it was too distracting for 2 of us while it really made the flavor for the last person.  So, know how you feel about dill going forward.  3/5 star.  Mushroom Chicken - Chicken was wonderful of course and if you like mushrooms, this one would be good.  The flavors didn't meld too well though; they almost stood out on their own.  2/3 star  Cheeseburger - It's meat and cheese.  Good flavor for the ingredients.  3 star  Hawaiian - Tastes like a Hawaiian pizza with good quality ingredients. 3 star Greek - There was way too much spinach in this one.  The bites that had every ingredient in it was great.  It has potential with the flavors but it didn't quite it the mark, it needed more of the other ingredients, less spinach. 1 star for the wad of spinach but for the bites of all ingredients, 4 star. Jalapeño Popper - Tasted like a good jalapeno popper.  The ingredients were proportioned well, giving nice flavors throughout.  4 star  Sweet Empanadas Brought out in bags like dinner empanadas but dusted with powdered sugar.  Not sure if the sugar added anything but helped it smell really good.  In the dessert empanadas you have everything from mainstream flavors to a little on the adventurous side, offering something for everyone.  All made with flaky crust and come out very hot.    The King - Holy peanut butter batman! If you like peanut butter and bananas this would be for you, but not our cup of tea. 2 star Nutella & Banana - Flavors melded well together.  3 star PBJ - Nostalgic but still a lot of peanut butter.  2 star  Fig Cheese & Caramel - Yum yum yum.  Flavors really complimented each other and brought together really well. 5 star  Guava & Cheese - It was good but not great.  Didn't really taste the cream cheese though. 3 star  Plantain & Cheese - This one was executed well.  The plantain really brought the right amount of sweetness to the cream cheese. 4 star Ruiz's Pieces - The name says it all.  It was really good and would be excellent with the ice cream. 4"}
{"text":"What a fun, delicious find in downtown Mesa. We loved the decor, music and most importantly the food. The empanadas are excellent! I had the Chicken and Jalepeno Popper one. It's worth a drive if you don't live close."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago for the first time. My wife and both of our mothers were so excited about all of the food we had. This is a must visit place for anyone in the valley if you are looking for something to eat that breaks the mold of your standard south of the border cuisine. Even if you have to drive from the other side of the valley it will still be worth the trip."}
{"text":"As always amazing food! I had the Sopa Verde for the first time and it was delicious! I love the Hearts of Palm Salad and Arroz Columbiano and all the empanadas. This place is one of my homes-away-from-home in Downtown Mesa. A short walk from Center/Main or Mesa/Main Valley Metro Light Rail stations and well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I like this little joint. It's small, clean, and has a hip vibe.  The pernil empanadas were tasty. The crust is the main attraction, crisp but not greasy. The outer crust is made with flour rather than with cornmeal which is fine. I like both crusts as long as they're done right. The meat is flavorful, but slightly on the drier side. The version with rice and beans and pernil was OK, but I liked the straight pernil better. The ground beef was good also. I guess I subscribe to the \"less ingredients is more,\" approach to empanadas. Would've liked to have tried the chicken, but they were already out at 5pm on a Saturday.   The empanadas are a good size and my friend and I split 3 so we could try a variety. The green dipping sauce was a bit on the bland side, and I would've liked to have had a house made red sauce option.   We also ordered yucca, which is always great right out of the fryer, but cut quite thick so it can get starchy when it cools down. The hearts of palm salad was enormous, and can easily be shared between 2-4 people. It's packed full of fresh ingredients but it overall it wasn't anything special and the green dressing was also on the watery blander side. The plantain patty that comes with the salad was crispy and had a great texture. Again, it was fried but not greasy. I will probably just skip the salad next time, and save room for more empanadas, which are the star of the show.   Servers were casual but very attentive.   I don't get to the the East side much, but the next time I catch a show at the Mesa Arts, I will make a stop. It's literally walking distance."}
{"text":"It's on 1st AVE NOT 1st St. Had Acho Pollo platter with cilantro jalapeño salsa stuff. HOLY COW!!!! Fantastic!!! Wife and daughter had rice pudding for dessert but I'm loving this cilantro after taste. Great service. Family owned. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The empanadas were delicious.  My husband and I ordered different kinds and cut them I half and shared them.  That way we got to taste several different ones.  I don't have a favorite yet.  Will have to go back and see if I can change that."}
{"text":"I had the perenil in an empanada and both the meat and the pastry were great, my next option is to have it on a torta because it will come with more stuff.   The empanada options on the lunch special are good, but they haven't, at least these last two times, featured the really good ones.   Rice and beans are alright, but nothing to write home about. Just get a single empanada, like the classic, and a side of slaw. throw in a desert one if your still hungry."}
{"text":"We had the Arroz con Pollo and a variety of the empanadas, everything was so delicious!!  The service was also fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This place is another interesting find in the downtown mesa area, its off the main road, but worth the diversion if you like empanadas. They have a pretty wide selection that will cater to a-lot of tastes."}
{"text":"All the empanadas at Republica are yummy, and the service is great.  I particularly like the chicken, pernil, and \"El Capitan\" (beef, egg, olive & raisin) empanadas here."}
{"text":"Great Empenada's!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Quite a few options to choose from too which is always awesome"}
{"text":"It truly is a rare treat to find such an exquisite restaurant. This quaint little nook tucked away in downtown Mesa is serving up delicate, fluffy pillows of empanada heaven on the daily! From the first bite, I knew that this Chef was supremely passionate  about food.  I need to go back for dessert. Our server was delightfully charming and demure. Their garden is very impressive. This spot is positively heartwarming."}
{"text":"They were great! The outer shell is soft and hard at the same time.. I really loved the taste and how all of the stuff inside because it was always HOT. I would highly recommend this restaurant to you. The service is absolutely amazing here.But wait there's more now for the dessert!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I so appreciate this place! Very hard to find Caribbean/Latin (not Mexican) food in Phx that is reminiscent of those back home that are actually good!  The staff is really nice, orders are fulfilled quickly, and they stay open until 9p on weekdays!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't seat one person at their community table because they \"were so busy.\" Ok whatever. Ordered a couple empanadas to-go and they said sit down on the couch and we'll bring 'em over. 25 min later, I go ask if my order is up soon and it's sitting on a trash container waiting for me. These people do NOT know how to deal with a crowd. That table was still not even half full when I left -- they just didn't want to seat one person. They get two stars because the (lukewarm by the time I got them) empanadas had decent flavor. But way overpriced and too busy. Boo."}
{"text":"We've heard about this place from a number of people so we had to try it. We each got a platter with 2 empanadas. The empanadas are really small. So if you split one, it is about 4 small bites. The cheeseburger empanada was definitely the best, although couldn't be low in calories because there was actually grease dripping out when I cut it in half to share. But it was delicious. The El Capitain was probably our second favorite with the chicken and mushroom 3rd and the pork last. The maduros dipped in cream sauce were tasty--it seemed like the more I ate them the better I liked them. The taste grew from ok to yummy. The rice and black beans were good. If you mixed them together with the cabbage and added some of their jalapeño cilantro sauce, they were much more flavorful. For dessert we split the fig with mozzarella and dulce de leche. It was delicious.   Price was moderate. They add a surcharge to the price of the food, because of the minimum wage increase in AZ rather than raising the price of the food. A little odd. We had water with lemon to drink. After tax and tip our total was $40. Not too bad.   It was a fun place to try and yay that Mesa has another non-chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing all the time! Everything is really freaking good and I've tried half the empanadas on the menu. They are small so get 2 or 3. The gallo pinto brings me back to Costa Rica. The coconut porter was also a pleasant surprise. It has a trendy feel but still mom n pop. I like to think of it as a Costa Rican Cornish Pasty with way fewer hipsters, and no draft beer."}
{"text":"Delicious arroz con pollo. The food and drinks are great, but the service is some of the worst I've ever experienced. After first receiving very attentive service from 3 different servers, we were ignored after our food arrived. The margaritas were wonderful and we would have liked to order more, as well as dessert, but instead we sat for over an hour without anyone checking on us. We finally flagged someone down for the check, at which point she blamed us for not tracking her down earlier. I'd go back for the chicken and rice and more margaritas, armed with the knowledge that you have to be aggressive if you want service here."}
{"text":"I would like to relay a message to the owners... You guys have great quality food and we love your restaurant. Please pay attention to your customer service as most of your waitstaff is very slow to respond to customers coming in the door. I was there the other day, very few people there, but your waitstaff had people waiting 15-20 minutes to sit down as the very slow staff takes their sweet time to set tables and seat people. You need a better system for taking care of your customers. Set your tables ahead of time, allow people to sit down instead of making them feel like they are a bother to you. The quality of your food is great and delicious, but if the service does not improve you will lose customers. I give you 5 starts for your food and this will be great for you, however if you do not improve your attention to customers, I will rate you 1 star next time. remember, the customer pays your bills and they do you a favor by coming to your restaurant. You are not doing us any favors as we pay you for your service and customers should be treated better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The service alone made it worth it! We felt like family here even though it was our first time. And the food was EXCEPTIONAL! We had the Cubana empanada, colombian rice, ham and cheese, bean and cheese, and arroz con pollo. You could not go wrong with any of these! Order multiple empanadas though as one probably won't be enough. You'll want more anyway"}
{"text":"I really like this little joint. Our second time here. The plates were good. Capitan and Guava empanadas are my favorites. I didn't read the previous reviewers comment about the surcharge before my visit, but just checked my receipt, and sure enough, there it is: $1.32 for our party of three.  It doesn't seem like an acceptable way to handle the increase in minimum wage-- a random surcharge. Anyway, we enjoyed the food so I'll keep the surcharge to myself!"}
{"text":"First things first. This place has Amazing food, and I will probably be back, however they are getting one star because the manager on duty, I don't know her name, was not pleasant to deal with. Let me just say that, I don't do well being deceived. I ordered about a dozen Empanadas, as a to-go order. I asked what sauces they had and the man I placed my order with said for every 2 empanadas ordered, there was a salsa that came with them. I asked if there was any other sauce/dip and he said jalapeño ranch. I asked if I could get one of them to try, and he said no problem, since I had a large order. Apparently they normally charge for the ranch, and had I known this from the beginning I would have gladly paid for one side. However when I asked if there was a ranch in my order the manager said I would not get one. I tried to be polite and say that the gentleman who took my order had offered me one. She still said no. I asked her to speak with him and she refused. I told her that I would let yelp know. As I left, and got in my car, a woman approached me and asked if I had a problem with my experience at the restaurant. I told her what had happened and she said she knew the owner, and if her was there he would never stand for that. I know that I'm up on a soapbox, but it was just poor management that made this experience so bad. I hope they read this and don't repeat their actions with the next customer."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places in AZ for authentic empanadas. Service and seating need some improvement but the food way outdoes this minor setbacks."}
{"text":"Wow.  This was an amazing stop for dinner.  We ordered one of each empanada and shared.  Each one was better than the first.  They tasted fresh and homemade! Great sauces.  Their drink menu was better than average with a nice list of local beers.  The desserts were awesome.  Yes, we tried them all.  I even had their aquas fresca watermelon and it was great.  So glad we came here.  The lady that waited on us was a ball of positive energy that made the experience that much better! Wow! I will be back when I'm traveling to Mesa!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Check Please, Arizona and went to try them out for lunch today. We loved it. The service was a little slow but very friendly and the food was excellent. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Black bean salad with chicken is absolutely yummy and so good for you! The lime vinaigrette added just the right touch! I must remember to frequent this hidden gem more often!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place yet, you are definitely missing out!   The outer crispy layer of the empanada just fits so perfectly with whatever they stuff inside. Every single one I've tried so far has yet to disappoint and I'm excited to try other flavors they have to offer. And the savory ones fits so well with the delicious salsa they pair it with. I can literally swim in a sea of their salsa.   I highly recommend the chicken one and the cheeseburger ones so far. Those are my absolute favorite.   If you come in for lunch, their lunch special is pretty awesome with 2 empanadas with a side of rice + beans + cabbage salad   I've literally picked up some empanadas for friends and family to introduce them to this deliciousness and everyone has loved it as well. They stayed nice and crispy by the time I reach home which is usually about 45 mins.   Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food! The waiter was very accommodating and knew exactly what was vegan. He directed me to a two empanada plate and I picked the two vegan empanadas they had (chickpea veggie, and potato). Both were delicious, and they were super nice about giving us extra sauce. The french fries were house made and fresh, also yummy.   Even if you're not vegan, this place is fantastic. But 5 stars for taking care of the vegans. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"If I had a way to add one more star, I totally would!  First of all, let me say that I do NOT like rice dishes that much, especially central/south american rice dishes.  The arroz con pollo  here is one of the best foods I have ever eaten!  I'm not kidding.  I don't know what they put in there (well, besides rice and chicken) but I just cannot stop eating that rice!  The staff  is always friendly.  Not sure when everybody else has waited so long.  They're usually busy when I go and I tend to get served rather quickly.     Another plus is the simplicity of their menu.  It's a small menu which means that they can specialize in what they're good at resulting in much better quality food.  But don't take that to mean you'll have an easy time choosing your meal.  Literally everything on the menu sounds delicious!  My general go-to, though, is El Capitan which has seasoned ground beef and... well, I'm not sure what's in there.  Magic, I'm guessing.  They are well-stocked on bottled sodas from Latin America and have decent size fountain drinks.  I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment, but they do have some really good specials on drinks!  Oh, dessert! OMG how could I nearly forget dessert?!  Empanadas with figs, cheese and caramel!  Empanadas with peanut butter and Nutella! Empanadas with Bananas and Nutella!  Seasonal flavors as well.  Seriously, if you don't get dessert at this place you'll make the angels in heaven cry.  And you don't want to be responsible for making angels cry."}
{"text":"Checked out this spot with the fam a few weeks ago. Loved the fact that they have a good lunch special and dessert empanadas. The cheeseburger empanada was my favorite! I love that they have Costa Rican staples such as gallo pinto (fried rice with black beans) and arroz con pollo (fried rice with chicken). I met the owner and she is a lovely woman, all the staff was amazing and friendly, and everything was clean and nicely decorated. I love that they have a sofa with a coffee table and coloring books for the kids. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! My girlfriend and I went there for one of our date nights. They have a great assortment of empanadas, including vegetarian options. When we went there, it was pretty empty, which was nice because the service was incredibly fast and we were able to really appreciate the vibe. The small restaurant is done really nicely, and the prices are very reasonable. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I am bummed to say that nothing has really changed from my last visit.  No welcome upon entering, in fact no eye contact...  The lady that I'm sure is the daughter of the Meraz mom had a really stern pissed face as she checked my pickup order and didn't ever say hi or welcome just tells me my total and rings me up like I'm annoying her or something.... It was a pickup order and my kids ended up wanting to eat inside rather than in our car so we sit outside and she walks out later and says \"oh I see you decided to eat here\" but with a real stern unhappy look. I ordered empanadas for my kids and luckily they liked them... I took a bite and they were ok, nothing at all special...   I have this place a second shot thinking maybe last experience was just a one off but it was just the same as last time. Very very poor customer service for non regulars, no welcome, no smile. And on top of that their empanadas are not anything memorable... I just don't understand what everyone is seeing in this place. . It's really just a hype, I mean, they were featured on TV, maybe that's why people want to reflect \"ooh I ate at this cool hip restaurant that was on TV so I'll give it 5 stars\".   Not me. Food is not memorable, so far I've tried 6 different savory empanadas and none have made me think, damn, I need these in my life! Place is cool inside, nice decor, Latin hip Customer service is sorely sorely lacking... Didn't make up for the food in any way."}
{"text":"Wow this place was great. It is just a small place but I highly recommend the empanadas they had just the right amount of spice. Even my wife was happy which earned it five stars."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place! I grew up in South America eating empanadas and I never thought I would find such an authentic place in the valley. We loved the food, and we enjoyed watching the world cup too! We'll definitely go back whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Updating my review on Republica Empanada. Unfortunately after trying out multiple different empanada places, we found the food here to be good but nothing stellar.  I had the Empanada platter with the Republica Chicken and the Jalapeño Popper. The platter came with rice, beans, cabbage salad, and maduro's & creama. My husband got the same platter with the Pernil and the Cubana. I personally liked both of the empanadas but the side dishes were a bit bland.  The service was good and we enjoyed sitting outside. They have a really nice space! Overall, I'm sure we'll return. Next time, I'm going to be trying one or two of the dessert empanadas!"}
{"text":"The empanadas were very good. I had a cheeseburger empanada and a jalapeño ham empanada, as a dish with rice, black beans and plantains. The rice was a little undercooked. The plantains and creme sauce were a nice sweet finish to the meal.  The restaurant definitely has a hipster feel. I thought the food was overpriced for what it really was. The food came out at different times for our table of 4, and they forgot a side for the last guest who ordered.   I used the rest room, and the door had tacky-stickiness near the handle. I think they have tried to dress up a run down building, but you can still see some of the wear and tear of the previous user...  Overall, it was a decent dining experience, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Always a delicious meal at Republica Empanada! I often get a few of the ham and cheese Empanadas and am never disappointed. I love bringing friends here because the food is so unique. This time we tried the fries and plantains. Both were delicious, but I especially liked the fries. The menu offers a wide variety, so all are sure to find something they like. Always pleased with this spot!"}
{"text":"Wow, deliciously different. Made a bit of sampler platter with my wife. Tried 8 different empanadas...all delicious, but the Boricua and El Capitan were my favorites....primarily for being so different and complex. Great melange of flavors. Loved the spicy green sauce they give you on the side. The restaurant is very clean, great, friendly and efficient staff. They are very helpful explaining the different ingredients. Great addition to Downtown."}
{"text":"Yum! The empanadas are not big so you get to try 2-3. Every one I tried was very good. There are only 4-5 choices of sides I believe and I only tried rice and black beans and those were good as well.  I went a few times while in town and always saved room for a third and made it The King, a desert empanada. Wow! Sin-sational!  PB, banana, little honey, powdered sugar on the outside. I always wished I had just ordered 3 Kings."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to come eat here for lunch one day a couple weeks ago and so glad we came here! From the outside it looks a bit interesting... But the inside is very nicely decorated, very colorful and modern. We got one of the lunch plates (two empanadas with rice and beans) and then another two empanadas to share since it was our first time. Everything was all really good, especially the Cuban and Pernil empanadas. We also got the cheeseburger (doesn't have a great punch of flavor) and the mushroom chicken. I've had Maduros from a Cuban restaurant in Louisville, KY and had to order them here when I saw them on the menu. These were just as good; although we weren't crazy about the dipping sauce that came with it. Overall, definitely looking forward to coming back here! We didn't get a chance to order dessert and I had my eye on a few of them!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how anyone can give less than a five star review. The sangria was strong and not too sweet. I ordered the empanada platter with the beans and cheese and pernil empanada. Somehow the beans and cheese in the empanada tasted even better than the side of beans. The pernil was moist and really flavorful, I was sad when I didn't have another one to eat. Since the restaurant is small I can see how busy this place could get but I came after the lunch rush and didn't have to wait for a table or my food."}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is a gem in downtown Mesa. The owners are accommodating and the food is delicious and innovative.  Try the Greek, Jalepeno popper, Republic chicken or pernil popper or if you like something simple for the kids or yourself bean & cheese, cheese, or cheeseburger empanada...  For something light try the hearts of palm salad or arroz con pollo...  Enjoy agua frescas, housemade sangria, or organic margaritas, or craft beers."}
{"text":"This place was super chill and delicious. Matthew was my server and was knowledgeable, fast, and most importantly friendly. He made the whole experience worth while. (Not to mention the food was great!)  I had the fries for starters and they set the tone for the whole visit. They were awesome! Then I tried multiple empanadas and they were excellent and perfectly fried. Go here now!!"}
{"text":"Our server Matthew was very enjoyable, fast and friendly! The food was savory, large portions and tasteful! The drinks were ice cold, sweet and went well with our meal. The atmosphere was inviting, music was great and outdoor space was so relaxing!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty, fun and super cute inside - What is not to like? Plus, they have happy hour!   We got the Combo Caribe to start  which is fried yuca fries with jalapeno ranch sauce, giant squished green plantain chips, and sweet plantains served with crema for dipping. Yuca fries would have been improved by being a tad smaller and crispier and I wished the jalapeno ranch was spicier, but all in all very good. Sweet plantains were the obvious winner of this trio, and I shall be back to eat many of them.   We then got the chicken and veggie empanadas and the pulled pork (pernil) along with simple cabbage salad, Earl Grey iced tea and watermelon agua fresca. The empanadas were light, crisp and delicious. I really cannot wait to try the more exotic offerings!"}
{"text":"Will definitely come back. Food was outstanding and excellent service, all at a reasonable price. The empanadas were cooked to perfection. As you take a bite, you're taste buds will squeal with delight! Be sure to check out the seasonal board before ordering, lots of other yummy options to choose from."}
{"text":"The best empanadas my husband and I have ever had. Super cool quaint atmosphere and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I had such high hoes or this restaurant, The Yucca fries with dipping sauce was yummy, the waiter was very good. knowledgeable,  But I found the empanadas to be lacking, Husband ordered the Cuban, was good, and  Greek, the Greek was nothing but spinach, and a small piece of feta, and extremely small, husband was not impressed. We both ordered a dessert Empanada, I ordered the fig with cheese and Honey caramel sauce, the figs were dried, and chewy, the cheese was melted hard, and there was not a caramel sauce to be found, The waiter sent the sauce that went with the yucca fries not the caramel sauce, it needed a sweet component. I was disappointed as this was recommended by our waiter, and I adore figs. Husband loved his banana cream pie. I am not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"If you want to treat you taste buds to something deliciously different than the normal Az cuisine, this is the place.  Republic has a great locally owned vibe and the food is fresh and delicious.  So far I have not ventured past the El Capitan and Chicken.  This evening I tried the Fig, cheese and caramel.  Soo good.  The empanadas are just the perfect size that you can dip them into the tasty green sauce and treat the buds to a pop rock like experience of flavors.  Went well with their double IPA."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews I read about Republlca Empanada said the service was poor or just plain bad. I say it depends on whether they are busy or not. Out server was friendly, and very knowledgeable.The food taste wise was very good. . My only gripe is the portion size doesn't match the cost for your meal. I had the Empanada Platter Choose any two savory empanadas. Served with rice, beans,cabbage salad, maduros & crema Mexicana. For $13, potion size dose not give you enough bang for your buck. Same for the Vegan Platter Served with an Achiote Potato empanada, rice, beans,cabbage salad, maduros and avocado . Also $13. Next time  I  would try ala  cart  choices and see how that works. The owner was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's always been good although it's usually empty. My sister, friend and I went before a concert at Mesa Arts Center, and it was unusually packed. They didn't do a good job handling the chaos. The waitress quoted us a 20 min wait time which we were agreeable to, but it was my sister who had to ask her to start a wait list for all the parties building up in the lobby. Many people ended up leaving due to the disorganized handling of seating.  Food wise, I enjoy their empanadas, but I'm a vegetarian and their choices are disappointingly limited. They should really explore veggie options because there's tons they could create, and I'm sure they would be delicious. I wanted to try something new, so I ordered the torta. I asked if I could sub tostones for the fries, but the waitress said that's not allowed. Uh really? There's just no possible way you can not put fries on my plate and put tostones in their place? I would be more than happy to pay the upcharge. I told the waitress to forget and asked for the gallo pinto plate (their vegan entree) instead, but I still got the torta with fries. Sigh. It was a good torta, and at least I got some plantain goodness as a sandwich topping. My sister and her friend loved their buffalo empanadas although I think the too warm wine was augmenting our appetites.  There's a lot of room for improvement at Republica, but due to the dearth of good restaurants in downtown Mesa, I would still come here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"My daughter had lunch here on Monday based on many recommendations from friends of her school nearby, and she told us how friendly the owner was to her and her friend.  She said that he gave them an empanada on the house.  (I was thinking did she look low on $, or was he super nice.  I am sure it was the latter!)  She loved the service and said the food was amazing.    My husband and I decided to try it tonight, and it was exactly as described.  The food was outstanding. I prefer baked empanadas, the way I make them at home, but these were sinfully good.  The jalepeño popper was my absoulte fave!    Service was a little chaotic once they got busy, but it was still very good.  Next time I visit I will bring my own sweet n' low or stevia since they do not carry it for tea.  Otherwise, perfect visit!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Small and located in downtown Mesa. I must have missed thus place many a time.   The Cubana, Republica, Pernil, and Borica were my lunch. All good.  If you are in Mesa downtown, do hit this place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere and cute diner feel.  The selection was amazing and variety awesome.  I would eat there once a week if they were in my town.  We loved it so much we ate there twice."}
{"text":"A real hidden treasure awaits you in this downtown location and it's worth the trip from anyplace in metro Phoenix. They really got a grip on Empanadas!!  Give this place a try you will be pleasantly treated!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  This is not regular Mexican.  Awesome place to try something new.  They also have vegan choices too."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I tried about ten of them and loved every one of them! A little pricey in comparison to portion but so DELISH I will be back, prob often."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I am not familiar with this cuisine, but everything I tried was very good. We had three empanadas - ground beef, pork, and chicken.  We tried the beans and rice as well as the salad. The sweet date empanada we had for dessert was absolutely special. That might be worth a second trip by itself.   OTOH - They were way over their heads on managing a preconcert crowd. The service was far below even an amateur standard. My reservation was ignored and my reserved table given to someone with no reservation right in front of me while I was standing there being ignored for almost 10 minutes. The host, while clueless, to his credit was also the busboy and a server. He was set up to fail. Then the harried waitress, took someone's order who had been seated after me and quickly turned her back on me. She was standing three feet from us. However, she was extremely skilled in the art of not making eye contact and only doing one thing at a time. She offered no help negotiating the menu and we had to rudely yell for her attention and force her to write down what we wanted. Her preference seemed to be causing a scene as she thought the afore mentioned yell was beneath her \"calling.\"  She is not a natural server - more likely voted most likely to file a liability law suit - chip on the shoulder comes at no extra charge.   On a slack night these same people are likely the nicest folks anyone would want to meet. They would have greeted us, seated us, chatted us through the cuisine, and served us with charm. They were understaffed, untrained, and overwhelmed. Happily the food was very good. Probably just bad timing. But be forewarned."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so unique. A great place place to wind down and enjoy some unique empanadas. The Boricua is delicious. I also tried the Pernil and Cubana they were pretty good. Pernil was dripping a little grease and the pickles in the Cubana could have been a little smaller, but honestly you just should to try them all."}
{"text":"Been back twice recently, and I think the food just keeps getting better. I've had the jalapeño popper, the chili relleno, chicken, fig and Carmel, and banana Nutella empanadas. All were freakin amazing. I'm going to take my uncle there tomorrow."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come. Very ordinary but cool! The owner is too sweet! They have the best empanadas!!! Everything else is beyond good. A unique spot and I find it hard to stay away..."}
{"text":"The empanadas are sooo good, I had the cheeseburger, republica chicken, and the Nutella banana. Sad to give it only 3 stars but the service is kinda off. Took me and husband 10-15 mins to get seated since it seems like they are short staffed and we witnessed two couples leave because they were waiting too long to be seated."}
{"text":"Another place in downtown Mesa that is missing  the boat. No paper menus to go. SLOW service. The food looked exellent but I'm a busy professional, I can't wait or take a hour llong lunch, unless I get a job woriking at the Courthouse or the City of Mesa--good pay, cake jobs, count me in."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated and not worth it at all.  A friend from the area recommended it while we were visiting but it was a huge disappointment. The food was okay, we got 2 savory and 2 sweet empanadas but the value simply wasn't there.  The sweet ones were better than the savory since they had better flavors.  The savory ones were rather plain tasting unless you used their salsa verde (which was tasty).  Also ordered a cabbage salad as a side as well since we didn't want the rice and beans that came with their combo plate.  There was no description of the cabbage salad so I thought it was probably like coleslaw or something.  What came literally was shredded green cabbage that would be used as a garnish in a bento box.  I think I saw maybe a few strands of purple cabbage and 1 or 2 bits of tomatoes, no dressing, etc.  Also they charged another 3% to the bill to pay for the minimum wage increase or something like that.  I wouldn't mind paying for that if I didn't feel like they were totally gouging you.  There's no way this place should be rated this high (4.5 stars)"}
{"text":"The empanadas are delicious but pricey. They are basically $4 to $5 each. I'm used to getting them for $1 or at the most $2 in New York City, even the ones with the different stuff inside like mac and cheese and potatoes, ect. I ordered 4 different types of empanadas: cheese , bean and cheese, maduros and cream cheese and jalapeno potato popper. They were all good except for the bean and cheese. There wasn't any cheese in it, just black beans. I told the server and he didn't seem to care much that it didn't come with one of it's main ingredients so I had to knock off a star for that. The other star had to be taken off for how expensive this spot is. A regular sized empanada for $4 to $5 bucks? Am I in Paradise Valley or something? The Maduros (Plantains) with cream cheese empanada was amazing, best thing on the menu hands down. I'm coming back for that every once in a blue moon. I do like how they have a bunch of different foods from a variety of nationalities on the menu. I seen Columbia, Puerto Rico and Cuba, only one missing was Dominican Republic! Then it would have been 5 stars for sure if they had something with that in the name!! I'm a little bias on that one haha. Cool spot just wish the prices were better and stay away from the bean and cheese empanada unless you just want a black bean empanada with nothing else in it. The server never refilled our water cups so I was pretty thirsty eating my last 2 empanadas."}
{"text":"Just happen to be in the area with the wife and decided to check them out. We were getting ready to see a concert at the nearby casino and needed to fuel up on some craft beer and get a quick sampling of their Empanadas.  Nice job on the remodeling of an old building that looks like it could have been everything from possibly a bank to several Mexican food joints. Inside is pleasantly decorated with a happy face greeting us at the door. Nice!  Started off with a couple of tasty locally brewed Hefeweizen beers from SanTan Brewing Co. They even brought us a cute little chilled glass to make the occasion special. There are also several other choices of beer and a few of wine that you can choose.  Had to try out the Cubana, El Capitán, Republica Chicken and the Pernil Empanada. They were all really good. My favorite was El Capitán and the wife really liked Pork Pernil. The Empanadas were cooked perfectly and had a nice amount of well seasoned filling inside.  We have had these kind of treats at several restaurants here in town and think these were the best tasting yet. Been to a couple of restaurants where they reheat them in a microwave or toaster oven. Party Foul. This place makes them correctly and with a lot of TLC.  Looking forward to coming back so that we can try out their Sweet side of the menu and the Albondigas Soup that was offered to us on our last visit. They also have Salads, Appetizers and a few Platters that look really delicious. I'LL BE BACK!  4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Great quality and choices. It's a unique spot in DT Mesa. The main downside is the limited seating, and seating close to strangers."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends, we were in town and wanted some good local grub. Marco, Emma and the staff were the best! Food was authentic and awesome. If you live in the area, you are stupid for never coming here. If you are visiting the area and dont come here, slap yourself and get in the car and go!"}
{"text":"Really happy we came across this place on our trip to Phoenix. Delicious empanadas in a comfortable, casual atmosphere. We tried a bunch of different empanadas, all delicious, and the salsa provided to top them was fantastic."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best cheap eats in Mesa, and within walking distance to the Mesa Arts Center. Small restaurant, parking in the back, good service. Order the yucca frita, much better then any fries."}
{"text":"This is a friendly, tasty, fried fast food joint. Fried but not greasy!!  I'm here with a group and the outside/inside choice is perfect. Everyone, even veggie lovers are happy!! The pernil empa is crispy but not greasy, with a delicious meatball of juicy pork. Also loved the plantains, rice and black beans! And the sweet empas were good too.  Dinner for $11! A real find"}
{"text":"Crazy good food but to get everything - fried yucca, lunch platter, a drink - I spent $25. On just me. Not something I would do on the daily. The Cubana is my favorite"}
{"text":"Nestled close to downtown, this place is a hidden gem in Mesa and definitely worth discovering! Although small inside & a slightly limited menu, containing empanadas savory and sweet (some gluten free, wheat, and vegetarian choices) a few appetizers, platters, a couple sides, soup and salads, Republica Empanada was big on flavor! Beverages consist of RC products on tap, bottles of fully loaded Pepsi, Coke, Jarritos in several fruity flavors, canned soda, lemonade and tea. I ordered the Greek empanada filled with sautéed spinach, creamy feta, and kalamata olive, thanks to the suggestion of our awesome server Heidi, and that day's special, the Jalapeno popper empanada with cream cheese, ham, and roasted jalapenos, both melt in your mouth savory perfection! Oh and the jalapeno cilantro ranch is amazing, so great I could put it on both and could have finished it with a spoon! My daughter had the buffalo chicken which she wanted me to say that it was soooo good and from the one bite she was sweet enough to share I agree, it was soooo good! Only wished the empanadas were bigger but for my waistline's sake glad they're not because I want to try them all! Dinner isn't complete without dessert, so we ordered \"the King\" an empanada stuffed with peanut butter & banana. Little Miss loved it and by the last bite was saying thank you, thank you very much! (LL) I had melt in your mouth sweet perfection, fig and caramel empanada made with fig, mozzarella cheese, & South American dulce de leche, a definite must try! Great food, prices and service will definitely keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  The service was, well.....not good.  We stood at the front waiting to be seated for many minutes with the one server not acknowledging us. We decided to seat ourselves. When the server finally came to us she made us move to another table and said \"that's why I didn't seat you here. We might need this table to pull together to another \" Really? I was almost ready to leave. But.....I gave the benefit of doubt. As time went by, they seated 2 other people there without an issue. Wow :(( really? There wasn't much to offer for gluten free, but understandable. I got a side of cabbage slaw, black beans and fried plantains. The plantains were ok but way too greasy for my liking. The slaw and beans were good but how can you go wrong with that.  My friend got 4 different empanadas and said they were so so. I was NOT impressed at all. They seemed way understaffed and not interested in taking care of business. They were too busy taking phone orders and talking to other staff members.  Will I return??? Not likely"}
{"text":"Pretty good place!! I'm wanting to go back sometime soon!! Customer service was great as well!!"}
{"text":"I don't often take the time to write reviews these days, particularly if the current ratings reflect my experience. This one does not. This was my fourth visit here, and it will be my last.  The food was fine, but the service was horrid. And crappy service plus just fine food doesn't cut it these days. There are too many other good options.  We were a party of two, and we went for an early dinner before a show at MAC. When we arrived, there was an open table for two next to an open table for four. We asked for the table for two, and were told that it was the restaurant's \"policy\" to keep the table open so it could be combined with the four-top for larger parties.  There was no one else waiting at all for a table, so we pressed them. They would not let us sit there and told us our options were at the communal counter (we couldn't sit there on the backless stools because my husband has a bad back) or on the patio. I didn't want to sit on the patio because it was still hot outside and there were bugs, but we did because we wanted to eat sometime soon. After the meal, I ended up with about 20 itchy, welty bug bites on my legs. When I went inside the restaurant to escape, guess what? They had seated a party of two at the table we had asked for, and the neighboring four-top was still empty. I pointed this out, and there was no apology at all. The answer was just that they \"got busy.\" There were still tables on the patio, but I guess the other diners looked better/younger/hipper/richer/more fun than we did, so they got the table inside.  Moral of the story--silly \"policies\" need to give way to customer service when there is a good, articulated reason.  This place has lost another customer (see other service reviews below--there seems to be a recent trend) because they couldn't even offer me an apology for their bone-headedness."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Last night was my first visit here and the food and service was impeccable.  I lived in Panama, Canal Zone and missed good empanadas.  I have searched since 1966 for a good comparison.  I had the Boricua and my friend had the beans and cheese.  We also ordered a salad that was not on the menu (thanks to our waitress input), then for a finisher we had the   Dizzy Fig Local Mesa Grown Figs, with mozzarella & South American style Dulce de Leche.  If you have never tried Republica Empanada, you are in for a real treat.  Not a fancy place, tucked away off Main St. in Mesa.  Music a little loud."}
{"text":"Found this little gem through word of mouth and looked it up here and saw all the great reviews. Decided to try them out for lunch last week and my wife and i both ordered the special which includes 2 empanadas of your choice from a small list with a side of beans, rice and salad for around $8.  I went with the cheeseburger and also the Boricua empanadas. Both were awesome. The food was very fresh but i felt the portions of the sides were a little small.  The place is cozy & the parking can get packed but there is street parking available.  I can haz cheezburger empanadas!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, great service and very pretty but quaint. Independent as hell, the food is super soulful and homemade. Has a nice patio too! What a little gem in the heart of Mesa."}
{"text":"First time here. The food and service was absolutely fantastic!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great find!  I found myself down in Mesa for work and stumbled upon this cool little place. As a fan of empanadas (owing to trips to Argentina and Costa Rica), I was excited to see the sign and I made my way into the building. I had the lunch special - 2 empanadas, with a couple of sides. I had one chicken and one that had tomatoes and olives and chickpeas and a bunch of other stuff. Delish!  They also have agua fresca and a collection of local beers. If you ever find yourself in Mesa, check it out!"}
{"text":"The empanada platter is the way to go! Very filling and delicious, my favorite is the potato jalapeno popper. Simple menu with a good selection. Very casual setting. Melody served me and it was probably the most genuine service I've received! Super heartwarming and made my night all the better"}
{"text":"I'm digging the Downtown Revival! Republica Empanada was a great place to stop for a nice lunch. The service was great, the lunch special is fantastic and a good amount of food, I didn't leave the slightest bit hungry. The empanadas were delicious, and the decor and atmosphere were quaint, welcoming and thoroughly enjoyable. Will stop by again. Love the original building!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 5 for dinner and the restaurant was entirely empty. This was nice as we had great service and the entire menu was explained to us by our waiter. He suggested the combo app platter that had tostonies, fried plantains, yucca & two dipping sauces which was a jalapeno ranch and regular ranch. This was good but did fill you up pretty quick. He recommended the dinner combo... OK portions are huge. Could have skipped the app combo. Dinner special was 2 empanadas of your choice. They have about 10 different varieties. Also on the plate was rice, black beans and some more fried plantains. I would have opted for the dinner special. You can order the empanadas individually which run around $3 each, they also serve 4 different tortas with the same fillings they use for the tasty empanadas. Place was very clean on the inside. As we where seated a couple was leaving. They decided to move outside by the main entrance and proceeded to smoke. The smell of smoke did fill up the dinning room and the owner asked the patrons nicely to move away from the door which they graciously did. The food was very good and the service was excellent. Prices pretty decent as well. Dinner special ran $11 and well worth every penny."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account just so I could post about this place! I went into Republica Empanada today for a lunch date. I ended up being stood up for said date! Not only did they give me a free dessert, but they were incredibly kind and said it was his loss that he didn't show up. I decided to stick around and have lunch anyway, and I have no regrets about that! I got to eat great food in a comfortable place, and listen to some great music! They have created a business where people will not only want to return because of the food (which was FANTASTIC; I recommend the peanut butter and banana empanada) but people will want to return for the whole atmosphere and the kindness of those that work there! I will definitely be back, and next time probably with a girlfriend or my mom. :)"}
{"text":"The food was great! I tried the republica chicken, cheese, and Nutella banana. They were all wonderful, and came out really quickly. The interior was very clean and modern. All of the empanadas were $3-3.50, so they're great for even just a snack before going to the art center or museum."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was awesome and the owner the kept the place open till we finished! Talk about service.   I'll be sure to come back when I'm in town.... Really really good... The salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"What a strange experience. This place fell way short of the hype and buildup, and I walked away very disappointed. I entered at a time where there was nobody else in the restaurant. I believe they were transitioning from their lunch configuration to their happy hour at the time. I was asked to wait to be helped, and I did -- I stood at the entrance for a pretty long time before someone (who seemed like the owner), who was more interested in chatting with an employee than addressing me, finally approached me.  I had never been before, so I asked for some guidance in ordering. I opted to go for the lunch plate special, which has two empanadas, salad, and rice and beans. They were out of the boricua, so I ended up asking for a pernil and a cubana. Apparently, the lunch special only applies to specific empanadas on specific days, but the person serving me said he'd allow this order since it was my first time. This was nice of him, but over the course of the meal he reminded me 3 or 4 times how much money he'd saved me by doing this. Honestly I could've gotten both on their own for under a dollar more than the combo cost, so it really wasn't the huge act of kindness he made it out to be.  The service continued to be weird as the owner initially seated me and took my order at the bar, then had me move to a table before serving me the food. Maybe he wanted a tip? The food took forever considering that they apparently have these ready already, and that I was again the only customer in the place (and no they were not close to closing). Once I was served, he never came to check on me. Anyway, the empanadas were tiny and really not filling by any means, and unlike similar combos from other restaurants, this place served seemingly the tiniest portion of rice & beans that I've ever seen. It was like one serving spoon's worth. If you're going to make the empanadas so small, at least compensate with the sides which cost next to nothing to make.   In the interest of being fair, the empanadas did taste pretty good, but there wasn't really enough of them to confirm that -- they were gone in 3 bites. In New York (and maybe somewhere here, haven't found it yet), you can get very tasty, well-sized empanadas for a dollar a pop from a lady's street cart. So I have to roll my eyes at paying 3-4 bucks for one that's less than half the size.  The sense I get from this place is that it desperately wants to be a modern trendy hipster place, and it has all the hallmarks of one. The logo, menu, and design of the place are all filled with hipster eatery tropes, and yes, good craft beer selection yadda yadda. I like many hipster eateries. But to Republica, apparently, near-absentee service, overpriced and underportioned food, and a healthy dose of pretension all come with the territory."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, unique , great food, nice set up :) I will go back"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. We were there around five PM, and they were not busy at all. Very attentive wait staff, nice selection of beers as well as real cane sugar sodas. The empanadas were delicious, both savory and sweet. Reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I'm puzzled how this place received so many positive reviews. My visit was a disappointment. Sure, the decor is trendy and the atmosphere is energetic, but the positive stops here.   I had the lunch special (select 2 empanadas from a list, salad, black bean, and rice) with the King (peanut butter and banana) and Boricua (pork). The Boricua has decent taste, but nothing special. While the King is creative, the ingredients were not distributed evenly....so you literally get half banana empanada and half peanut butter empanada. The black bean was absolutely bland. I'm not too crazy about the two spoonful of cabbage salad either. The white rice is the best tasting element of the meal. It's one of the most flavorful rice I've had..thanks to the coconut milk(?).   Perhaps the worst thing about this place is the service. When I was ready to order, the cashier/server made me wait 5 minutes while she went to clean tables, refill water...etc. waited 25 minutes for food until I asked the server. Was told they messed up the order. Waited another 5 to 10 minutes before food arrived, but and there was no silverware. I had to go behind the counter to help myself because the server was MIA. It's especially painful to watch the food at the window ready for pickup for more  than 5 minutes...yet the server was clueless where the food should go (she messed up the order of the next table, too). It wasn't busy at that time and there were 5 staff and about 15 customers. If they can't handle with that staff to customer ratio, I doubt they can handle a busy lunch/dinner crowd.   The next table left at the same time and one of the guys commented that he'd never return....yeah, me neither."}
{"text":"The Empanadas are outstanding! Various selections available for those that want to taste the different Latin meats/proteins from the island! My family enjoyed the Boricua, Pernil, Cheeseburger and Cubana Empanadas along with the combo platter of Tostones, Maduros and Yucca fritas (fries)! As for the dessert options - EXCEPCIONAL (Outstanding)! The manager/owner makes you feel welcomed to walk in!"}
{"text":"Excuse my French but this place is F***ING amazing.  Your a fool if you don't enjoy these pockets of joy!   Rated 10 STARS"}
{"text":"Great place and nice change of pace from typical good found in the valley - empanadas are a wide range of fillings and there is something for everyone. Try the sweet empanadas for dessert they are great"}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is an awesome unique restaurant in downtown Mesa, and one of the best. They have great and cheap specials, plates, and menu items. I've tried literally ALL the empanadas and can honestly say there isn't one I don't like. The fig and cheese is my favorite sweet empanada and I highly recommend. The family that owns and runs this restaurant really cares about every aspect of their business and you can tell. From the fresh ingredients and food all made from scratch, to the fresh flowers picked daily from the garden next door, to the family members managing, cooking, and serving. These people truly care about the food they serve and their customers."}
{"text":"I went with a group of people and we scheduled a reservation. The service was really good and the food came out quickly.  However...several of us did not receive what we ordered. For me, I did not get either empanada that I actually ordered. I got an empanada platter and took the empanadas home to eat so I could not have them exchanged. The beans were bland and the empanadas were so so that I ended up having. The plantains were very good though.   Because there were so many issues with getting the correct order (especially for the price I paid), I gave a 3 star. I probably will not go back. There are much better options for the price."}
{"text":"Taking another class, so Republica is back on the pre-class dinner rotation - and I'm excited about it.  I called the order in as I was leaving the house - it was ready for pickup when I arrived.  Still loving the Jalapeño / potato poppers, and have been working my way through the sweet empanadas - pumpkin pie last time (around Thanksgiving) - this time, banana cream pie.  Very tasty.  Make sure you get some extra green sauce if you get several empanadas - it's really great!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Idaho so our first step in a new city is to find Latin food (not Mexican). What a treasure it is here! It is clean, modern, and has good customer service. A requirement for us is to have tostones on the menu and theirs are excellent. There is no carne Asada type meats on the menu but did have a good variety. Especially for vegetarians or vegans. I thought my arroz con pollo would be saucier but that's because of past experiences at other restaurants. My rice was very flavorful. And go ahead... order one of each of all of the dessert empanadas. So good! Especially the fig. Thanks for an awesome, flavorful and filling lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Food is super good if you're into cultural food. Definitely different from your regular sushi or Mexican place, so if you're feeling adventurous but are scared to try something crazy, give this a shot. Unique, tasty, cool atmosphere, good people."}
{"text":"Empanadas are tasty but you will have to order a pile of them to have enough to eat for dinner.  I would recommend this place if your looking for appetizer portions of tasty food to go with your drinks but be prepared to spend a lot, no good deals on drinks.  Stay away from platters they are overpriced by about $6.00.  If you are going to try it out just get the empanadas and order a rice n' bean empanada instead of a combo or side order.  Allow plenty of time service is slow"}
{"text":"Showed up here for a lunch with my team from work. They weren't very happy with my suggestion when they found out this was a no service restaurant.  However the menu options including a number of vegetarian options impressed them.  The staff was very cordial and friendly and gave us many suggestions to help us make our choices as all of us were trying empanadas for the first time. They also have a number of Hispanic drinks to choose from.   The TVs were also playing the World Cup so it was fun to catch parts of the game. Great decor as well which makes it a nice spot to eat and spend some time. Will surely visit again."}
{"text":"Went last weekend. Ordered the Arroz Colombiano. Friendly owner and very good service. First time eating this dish. When I received it my first thought was, this is almost too pretty to eat. Glad I did though as this is one of the best dishes I've had in some time. Kudos. Will definitely go back to try some other items on the menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You go in and its very Latin hipster. I love the way we can walk up and order OR we could be seated by a waiter. The ones who are there to work, are super casual which helps new people who come there.  The empanadas, oh the empanadas!! I've been twice and not been disappointed. I ordered the Cubano, the jalapeno and cream cheese, the shredded pork, and the one with golden raisins. The most favorite part of the food wasn't actually the empanadas, but the house salsa! It went with every empanada I ate, whether out was supposed to or not. I loved it!  I have to take time to compliment the staff and Howe they take care of people and their things, because I left my credit card here by accident for three days and they kept it for me until I was able to come for it. Thanks RE!!! Not only do I trust you with my stomach but with my stuff if I ever forget it again!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Pretty slow to get food tonight, expensive bottled drinks, and then they added a service fee!  They just add a surprise fee to the bill and take money instead of raising their prices!  They are priced expensive enough already!  I HATE surprise fees so they can just reach in your wallet and take what they want.  We paid $70 for 4 people with a 25% Entertainment Book coupon.  They should be listed at $$ not $.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this 8 stars I would. Amazing, fresh flavors in a perfect dough. Huge variety. Had the cubano, pernil, el capitan and the dizzy fig. All very good. The cubano is the favorite but I still loved the rest. Great atmosphere. Extremely fast and friendly service. I know I sound like a commercial, but this is the real deal. I am a fan and will be a regular. My only complaint is that they are not closer to home."}
{"text":"Really cool place in the heart of Mesa. Nice place to go have dinner before a  show or just happy hour.  Beautiful art on the walls and yummy empanadas. Local beers and wine. Really enjoyed our time there. The servers were awesome and accommodating.  The dessert empanadas were delicious. I recommend the new Nutella  and banana empanada."}
{"text":"YUM!  We eat her when we are on this side of town and every time it is delicious!  I have tried every empanada on the menu, and haven't decided my favorite.  The star of the show it their green sauce!  And the warm desert empanadas can't be skipped.  They are small enough to order a couple to try a variety."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food. It's a great little place tucked away in downtown Mesa. Drop in you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and we had a variety of empanadas. All were delicious!!! The desert empanadas were delightful! I'm not even a desert person, but I had to try one after the tasty empanadas we had for lunch. I'll be coming back to try the other types!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in Mesa. Everything has been good every time and the service is incredible with such helpful and friendly staff. I recommend the jalapeño popper and Cubana empanadas and the Arroz con Pollo. Their salsa verde is good on everything!"}
{"text":"All I can say is OHH MYYYY! Took one bite and was in heaven. I think I gained 5 lbs today, but worth it. I had the lunch special since I could not decide what to do...come with beans, rice and cabbage salad. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. Everyone there is very friendly. Nice people Good food. The lunch special comes with two choices. I had the chicken and mushroom (very good) and the el capitan which was very flavorful. Both were excellent.  So I had to have desert.... banana and nutella... this was out of this world.  I will be back to gain some more lbs."}
{"text":"The place was fairly easy to find, we were greeted and sat immediately despite the rush. Did take a while to get our drink order due to short staffing. Otherwise, the food totally made up for it! A nice, and much needed spot in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"That was a really nice lunch, food was great and the staff was very friendly. Tried almost every Empanada they had all of them were very tasty."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Stop what you're doing and just go to Republica Empanada. Very cool vibes from the guy behind the counter, the music, the atmosphere. The building is in downtown Mesa, which has a cool mid-century modern feel; the restaurant looks like it was a bank built in 1960. There's also a really great outdoor space if you want to enjoy your super yumbo empanadas outside. We each got the lunch special: 2 empanadas with three sides, cabbage salad, rice, black beans. $8.25 each, a reasonable amount of food for lunch. I tried the El Capitan and the Boricua; my bf had two cheeseburger empanadas. They are served with a yummy, fresh salsa verde. We loved all of our food and will definitely return. Only 4 stars because I wish the empanadas were larger...so the deliciousness lasts longer!"}
{"text":"Want a hand held lunch that you can enjoy with variety? Empanadas are the way to go and Republica Empanada has made it so!   In a small location with some parking in a lot and more available along the street, flavor packed empanadas are created daily to satify many different tastes.  These are thick doughy empanadas made in an over rather, they are thin discs of dough that are stuffed, folded, sealed and fried to crispy perfection. They have many options for fillings, my favorite was the Boriqua, which was filled with arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas, they are like the baby of a pea and a lentil, a little fatter than a lentil and drier than a pea) and pernil (puertorican style roasted pork with lots of garlic, olive and annatto seed flavor).   The restaurant is small and can get full around the lunch hour. They offer daily specials that are NOT empanadas but are delish. I had a chicken, rice and her sopa that was thick and almost gumbo-like once that was YUMMY. It is counter service and they are friendly plus can help with any questions you have on the menu.   I can't wait to try them for dinner one day soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food! Great Service! They provide a great atmosphere for a lunch on the go. Glad I found this joint!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for lunch or date night in Mesa. I love bringing  people who were previously unfamiliar with Downtown Mesa and its charms. It's got such a great urban vibe all wrapped up in Mesa pride. And the food is delicious and seems to be lovingly prepared. The menu items which are gluten-free or vegetarian are clearly labeled as such. My favorites are the hearts of palm and avocado salad and the tostones, especially when the tostones have a little extra rosemary on them. But the shining star (aside from the empanadas, of course) is their salsa. Holy moly, I could drink that stuff! I could make my entire meal out of that stuff. It's also a great spot for a couple of drinks. I like drinking a margarita on the patio becaisw it's so beautiful out there."}
{"text":"First timer here! I have to knock off a few stars for: Price/ Value- $4 a piece for the empanadas and they were no more than  like 3-4 bites each. Way too expensive for the neighborhood. Everything was mostly alacarte. No menu deals or happy hour. They were tasty, but I couldn't afford to try more than 3 because of the price! A sampler option for sharing would have been more sensible.  Service- was mediocre and unfriendly. No water refills offered. No offers to order more food. Just the bill. The Bill- Like I said it's pricey. $30 for 2 ppl without a real entree and no drinks. And I had to ask for an explanation of a .89 \"surcharge\" on the bill.  I was informed by my server that they are blatantly passing on    Minimum wage increase to the customers. It made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"Gallo pinto was solid, empanadas were great. I suggest the combo apps with the tostones, yucca and the Maduros. And glass of wine or three. Good vibe; the Owners are super cool"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was ok. The chairs were uncomfortable and the place lacked any real vibe."}
{"text":"This place is Fantastic!  The empinadas are perfect and not oily or dry.  The Pernil is my favorite along with the Posole.  They serve beer and wine and are working on getting their liquor licence.   The lunch special is filling and delicious.  Or try the Posole for your lunch.  A great way to go.  The place has a great vibe, the staff are friendly and nice and the bathrooms are always clean!    I like supporting small business, and this is a win win!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Went for Valentine's day and they had a special table set aside with a flower. Food was amazing! Loved the dessert empanadas! Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I've never had empanadas like these before. I bought 6 (haha) let me tell you these were incredible, delicious. The plantains and beans perfectly complemented the meal. They're conveniently packed in a separate baggie which is labeled. The restaurant itself was cute and I especially loved the soccer on the tv!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but the service is terrible. It always seems very disorganized, and it smells like grease. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, yet tables stayed dirty for 10-15 minutes before anyone was able to reset them. Very frustrating. They need to get some front of the house people who know how to do their job. Two waitresses for a full restaurant is unacceptable. They were running all over the place like headless chickens.. Very unprofessional.  Food is meh"}
{"text":"Amazing place  the food is good the costumer service is good , the place is clean I recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Ill say this out right,  the food here is amazing.  It's obvious they take pride in it. The atmosphere is clean and trendy with a beautiful patio.  The price is steep for what I tend to think of as a cheaper food ( DC food carts and empanada shops ruined me). A plate with sides will be 12 dollars but you case buy individual empanadas"}
{"text":"Finally a good empanada place ;) Favorites so far are the El capitan and jalapeño popper with ham. Also tried the Cubano and buffalo chicken along with the chicken with mushroom ;) The restaurant is small but friendly hipster type of place. They have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Yeah, changing my review from 4 stars to 5. I  love this place and like to take in-town guests for a casual lunch. So far the Pura Vida and Jalapeño Potato popper are my go-tos. I am a vegetarian so I can't say to the other choice BUT I did have my first dessert empanada today. Holy Cow! Dizzy fig. It's insane and voted 1 of the 10 best desserts in the valley. I don't know if I would go that far but I know I'll try it again and then again and then again... ;)"}
{"text":"I used to eat at this building years ago. I think it was called Casa Rosa's at the time, but when I moved I wasn't able to visit again until after the business had shut down. For the first time in years, I saw this place open, so I excitedly pulled into one of the street side parking spaces and walked in.   The general idea of the place is the same. There is a tv, but the giant screen projection tv is gone for anybody that remembers it. You must walk in and go immediately left to see the counter where you order. All of the furniture is new and the interior has been completely remodeled from the looks of it. The employees were extremely helpful and polite, and I believe it was the owner that introduced himself to me. I ordered the Cubano, which alone is not nearly enough for a meal even though it was delicious. It was served with an excellent avocado sauce (didn't seem quite like guac).   They have a full selection of beverages imported from Mexico and therefore not including high fructose corn syrup. Order one of these with a two empanada lunch combo. Their prep time was very fast making this a good place for a lunch break or date. It also looks like they're applying for their beer license (exciting).   If you haven't been here since the building reopened in July 2013, it's definitely worth stopping by if you're in downtown Mesa around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Monday night was perfect. Absolutely delicious empanadas and great service. Clean place to eat as well. Try any of the sweet empanadas because they are all good. My favorite savory empanadas were the Cubana and the ham and cheese."}
{"text":"These guys have a great little restaurant.  Food is excellent.  I'm excited to see what they do with the place.  Hope the salads and entree selection on their menu grows!"}
{"text":"Great beer choice ( though not draft) and the food is EXCELLENT. The fig and cheese dessert Empanada was a perfect, sweet and savory finish. Mondays and Tuesdays you can get 4 empanadas and four beers ( or a bottle of wine) for $20 (2 People min.) I highly recommend this chic, little hole in the wall joint."}
{"text":"This place was great and they offered so many types of empanadas that I wanted to try them all. My wife and I even got our 17 month old a peanut butter and banana empanada and he ate every bite!"}
{"text":"I went to Republica Empanada after researching local places. Their fig, mozzarella and dulce de leche empanada caught my eye so I grabbed my partner in crime and went for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The place is tiny but very clean and nicely decorated. Not ideal with children. Inside it has one long table (bar) with bunch of chairs and about 8-10 small tables with 2-4 chairs each. They do have an outside seating area but I didn't go out. The place was rated A by health department as well.   I went just before noon and it was already busy. By the time 12:30 hit, it was packed. But they are very fast and lines moved quickly. The food didn't take long to come out and in the meantime, you get the enjoy the delicious smell.   We got 6 empanadas total. 4 meal and 2 sweet. We had the buffalo chicken, mushroom chicken, pernil, boricua, Ruiz's pieces and fig cheese & caramel. The savory ones were filled and generous. The pernil was tender and flavorful. The boricua is pernil with rice, peas, etc. and it had a tiny bit of spice and even better than the pernil. The buffalo chicken wasn't overpowering buffalo flavor and mushroom chicken was savory and moist with good spices.Ruiz's pieces was nutella and peanut butter. It was generously sprinkled with powder sugar and inside was warm and gooey. The star of the show for me was fig cheese and caramel. Dried fig with melted mozzarella and dulce de leche. What an interesting combination of flavors but it worked wonderfully together. It also came generously sprinkled with powder sugar.   It's a great local hole in the wall. We both loved everything about the place but the food is definitely worth the trip. It's a bit hidden but look for a red sign, it's hard to miss from the corner. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"The prices are way to high for a small portion of food. We had to wait for a 40 minutes for food and it was just myself and three other people in the place. Not the best sorry. Service is friendly but just waiting for food and the portions is outrageous."}
{"text":"What an excellent find! A cute place off of downtown Mesa. When my husband and I got there, we were impressed to see that the place was not your typical just average Mesa style restaurant. This place looks like some of those little mom and pop shops in downtown Scottsdale! When you arrive, you wait to get seated. They prepare the table for you and ask you to come in. We decided to sit at the patio cause it wasn't super cold tonight. While walking to the patio, I noticed a long bar like table in the middle of the place and other tables on the side. Everyone is so welcoming when you come in, even when we arrived 35 min before close!   We were given time to go over the menu and then our waiter came to take our drink orders and go over some menu options with us since it was our first time. He was very patient and explained a lot of dishes to us and made recommendations for some of their best dishes. The menu is not extensive but they have a good selection of appetizers, mains, tortas and of course Empanadas.   We ordered the Posole soup with chicken. It comes with a lot of toppings to add on top, kinda like Pho. It is served also with a piece of bread. This soup was so good. It's like a great pick me up soup after a long day or on a cold night, warm and very comforting. We also ordered the Yuca Fritas. I had never tried Yuca before. It's a more starchy version of potatoes almost, (for the people who like me, don't know what Yuca is). It was served with an excellent house ranch dip. For our mains, we decided to order the chicken, mushroom and kalamata olive empanadas and the potato empanadas. Out of the two, the potato one was my favorite, especially with their homemade green salsa!   Prices were very good. At the beginning we thought  the food we ordered won't be enough, especially since we were super hungry but our waiter was right in recommending our portions, we ended up eating everything and we felt full.   Service is beyond excellent. Tonight, I saw maybe 7 different people take care of us one way or another till we were done with our meal. The patio seating area looked so pretty tonight and they had a heater turned on for me because I was feeling cold, and that's when they over heard me saying I was cold! That's service!   This place just started off the weekend for me on an excellent note. So happy to have found it and will be going there again for sure! Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to RE. Both times I got take out. I will have to dine in one of these days for their Mon/Tues night special.   Their empanadas are really tasty! I like that they are crispy fried rather than soft baked. I bought 6 to share with the BF; 5 savory ones and one sweet. We had: El Capitan, Boricua, Pernil (pork), Chicken, Chicken & Mushrooms and the Caramel Fig one for dessert. My favorites were the chicken and pork. I didn't really care for the more complex ones. The caramel figs one was pretty good also. I think I would've preferred lesser caramel to taste more of the figs but I might be in the minority with this.   I have to say though what makes these empanadas over the top is that delicious green sauce that comes with them. Don't forget to ask for extra!"}
{"text":"Great empanadas! Love the location and atmosphere. My favorite is the pernil. Cheese burger, jalapeño popper are relish too. Sort of pricey."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. This will definitely be my new favorite spot after moving to the area. Super cute inside. Awesome food. Decent drink prices. And most of all, really sweet, competent staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Wednesday night at 7pm.  There was only one other couple there eating, we were grabbing something to go.  We ordered a couple empanadas each.    Wife had the potato empanada and the fig and cheese.  Both were really good.   I had the pernil and the chicken with mushroom. Both were good but the pernil was the best.    The green sauce they give you is really good. Has a little spice to it but it is just right.    After eating two empanadas I could use a third.  They do have a happy hour that ends at 7. Not sure what the specials are, but they do serve beer and wine.  They have a special Monday and Tuesday, $20 for 4 empanadas and 4 beers.  Must be shared with 2 people."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the empanadas and the feel of the place. Kind of hipster/retro but family friendly too. Definitely worth a try! Fun Mesa Yelp find."}
{"text":"We love this place. We've been a few times and decided to bring a friend from New Orleans today. Started off with some amazing tostones. They taste just like home! After devouring our appetizer, we tasted the jalapeño empanada.. dear lord make sure you have water near by.. yes they are spicy but oh so delicious! My favorite taste of home is the Boriqua empanada. Every bite is a perfect blend of arroz con gandules and penil... literally like eating christmas dinner in every bite.   Not only is the food amazing, the owners are really nice. They make sure you feel like home everytime you walk in. A great atmosphere, great prices and better food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Well-made food, great atmosphere. The avocado and heart of palm salad is possibly my favorite thing on the menu (with the exception of their nutella banana empanada). Their gallo pinto is even tastier than the versions I had in Costa Rica. This is an absolute must-try in Mesa."}
{"text":"These are the best empanadas I've ever had. The empanada dough is perfect. It's thin and crisp - not so thin that it's falling apart and not too crisp that it's hard to eat. The fillings are delicious and the dessert empanadas are uuuuhmazing! We came here two times in two days because we are out-of-towners and had to get as many empanadas as we could! I liked the Republica Chicken, Bean and Cheese, the Fig, Cheese, and Caramel desert empanada, and the guava and cheese. I'm seriously thinking the drive from LA might be worth it! Plus the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant in Mesa that serves amazing empanadas.  My family and I ordered take out and we got a variety of empanadas to try.  I have to say that not a single one disappointed us.  But I have to say, my favorite was the desert ones.  :)  I recommend 2-3 for a hungry adult male.  Maybe 4-5 if you're starving.  Save room for the sweet ones though.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Really good food, from really great people.  The Dessert empanadas with ice cream and dulce de leche were amazing! They were out of a few of the menu items I wanted to try, but I really liked the potato empanada, maduros (sweet plantains) and tostones (savory green plantains.) I'll definitely be back to try the yucca frita and bean and cheese empanada.  This place reminds me of fusion between, Havana Cafe and Cornish Pasty.  You should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I have yet to try an empanada that I would not have again. I enjoy having their savory ones, and your choice really depends on what you are currently craving. I have yet to try their dessert empanadas, but they look good."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to AZ, I met up with a friend who thought I would enjoying lunching here.  As I love empanadas, I have tried several types in Southern CA where I live such as Argentinian, Peruvian, Hot Pocketian (there is a place by my work that has more hot pocket things than empanadas even though they call them empanadas)  This place is located in downtown Mesa and is on the smaller side.  There is table and chair seating along the sides of the restaurant plus a community table in the middle.   It is a walk up to the counter and order and get your food delivered to you kind of place.  I trust my friend's judgment and as he has eaten here in past, I let him order for me.  There is a really good lunch deal for $7.95 that is available M-F that includes your choice of two empanadas, rice, beans and cabbage salad.  He chose the Boricua and El Capitan empanadas for me as he said they were very good.  And they were.  The Boricua was roasted pork with rice, peas and ham in sofrito sauce.  This empanada was yummy but my favorite was the El Capitan which was their version of a Saltena with seasoned ground beef,boiled egg, potato, green olives and raisins,  I loved this one as a I am a big Saltena fan.  The whole plate with the empanadas, beans, rice and salad were very filling and very good.   Service at the counter and at our table was friendly and helpful.  I know the best people in AZ who introduce me to places with awesome food and beverages.   Republica Empanada is a hidden gem worth seeking out for some tasty empanadas and other Latin-inspired food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place. I heard that the owners were from Costa Rica and I really wanted some authentic empanadas. They were yummy, the place was clean and trendy. I couldn't decide what to get so I took the server's recommendation. They were all just ok. A little dry and I had to douse mine in the salsa to get a good flavor. I might be back just to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Truth be told, this place is way outside of my regular travel pattern so I visit quite infrequently. However, anytime the Mesa Center of Performing Arts has a show that I want to see, I make sure that I go early in order to grab a meal at this fine spot. Empanadas are like baked tacos or samosas or pasties depending on where you are from. They are filled with goodness and served with rice and beans.   They are located in a cool mid-century building and have beer, wine, and cocktails. It's often very busy at meal time so plan to stand in line especially if there is a headliner at the Mesa Arts Center. And, if you're up for a short walk, you can park near this place and walk to your performance. Enjoy."}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown Mesa. The eatery offers a hip little hangout with a long community table down the center backing up to the Mesa Community Garden (you start to see the concept they are going for). The service was good, food was great, menu is sleek and simple.  We have not had a chance to try the desserts yet, that is on our list! The selection looks unbelievable. We heard they are also getting a liquor license, which will transform it from an urban eatery to a place to hangout and stay a while. Looking forward to that."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was disappointed based on the previous reviews. Portions were very limited and all the food was very bland.  Charged $6.50 for a small order of fries which I believe is a little excessive .   The cafe smells of fried food when entering.  Ambience is very limited.  Don't waste your time much better places close by."}
{"text":"When visiting Phx with my family I wanted to try an authentic, non chain, restaurant. I am SO HAPPY I found this place!!   It was DELICIOUS!! I shared the chicken empanada with my kids. Delicious. But the real star of the meal for us was the arros con pollo! I still dream of it weeks later. My kids (2 and 4yrs) could not get enough, they were practically fighting over the chicken pieces towards the end. It was the first time my 2yr old served herself more food. Good thing the PB&J empanada distracted them from the delicious dish!  I would recommend getting the arros to share and then a few empanadas for yourself. Staff was friendly.  Only con... it's a little loud in the restaurant.   I definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff & atmosphere were great and the food even better! I had the Pernil (seasoned pork) empanada & it was fantastic! But take my advice: though you'll be tempted to keep trying more of the deliciousness in the 'main course' or meat empanadas, pace yourself, because ALL of the sweet, dessert empanadas are equally amazing (the plantain & crema is the BEST in my opinion!). They also had a great, local beer selection! Great food, great prices & great service!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the supposed vegan options!  My husband and I stopped in on Friday evening. We were greeted after a few minutes and asked if we had a reservation. The place itself is incredibly tiny and casual dining. We were sat and ordered our food. I opted for the Vegan Platter which was $13. My husband picked out 3 empanadas and chose to get them with Rice and Beans.   We had a bit of a wait before our food came out, but our waitress did apologize for the delay. I was sad to see my platter only contained one empanada. It was hearty, but small. The platter also included some black beans, white rice, cabbage salad, some plantains and about 1/3 of an avocado.   Our bill seemed a little steep. $38 before tip and we hadn't even had appetizers or a dessert.  We will be back because my husband enjoyed it quite a bit. I may try the vegetarian torta next time. The menu states that it contains black beans and plantains... hopefully there are some more veggies on there as well."}
{"text":"Had their empanada platter with el capitan and boricua. Delicious."}
{"text":"We went here about 6 pm on a weekday before a concert at the Mesa Arts Center. The restaurant had high reviews so I thought we were in for a treat. Alas it was a total disappointment. When we first walked in, the restaurant interior reeked of grease. I instantly knew that if we sat inside we too would smell. We asked to sit outside, but a party had reserved the patio. With too little time to go elsewhere, we decided to stick it out, maybe the food would be worth it. I ordered the $13 empanada platter and chose the pork and chicken empanadas. The meal also came with black beans, rice, and slaw. The sides were fine, but nothing spectacular, just something that I could do at home. The chicken empanada was flavored well, but the pork was absolutely disgusting. It has a rancid fat taste. I was super disappointed; definitely not worth the price. My date had a shrimp/rice dish. The shrimp were under-cooked. She sent it back and they ended up prepping a new meal free of charge, which was very nice of them. She said in general that her meal was lackluster, and I felt the same way about mine. To add insult to injury we smelled like grease in the concert hall afterwards. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place food was so good! I can't say enough about the great friendly service. We never been here so when in Rome do what the romans do ask what's good and how to eat it! I can not wait to come back and try more!  We need a place like this in downtown Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"I had two of their empanadas and my wife and 2 others so I was able to taste 4 of them. They were all awesome! I don't have a favorite. I can see me getting different ones for my different moods but they will be perfect.   We also shared plantain chips. Yum! I haven't had plantain since our honeymoon cruise in the Caribbean and these did not disappoint. Probably better.  They also had some very tasty salsa-verde. Yum!  Note: I was also very impressed with clean, hip atmosphere. The large HD TV's playing \"Back to the Future\" was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Got the Vegan Pura Vida Empanada. Soooo bomb, but a bit on the small size. Next time I'll get two for sure. Fries were amazing! Green sauce was delicious. Chill ambience and service was fantastic. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Every one we tried was delish.  I am pretty picky about empanadas because I used to live in Venezuela where they are on every corner and better than any I have had here.  They had green sauce that was legit like the Venezuelan street vendors which I haven't seen since I left.  It went well with the chicken, the rest are very fusion type empanadas but I liked that there were traditional and empanadas like the Nutella banana.  Great mix of new and old and so yummy"}
{"text":"I had the arroz con pollo and it was delicious! The maduros I got were not sweet and that was the only bummer."}
{"text":"Just came in and ordered several empanada s to try. Ham and cheese  El capitan The Cuban The peril The boricua The cheese And finally a sweet empanada, the fig cheese and caramel.   My favorites in the savory category are the boricua and the fig cheese caramel was jaw droppingly amazing. The boricua is filled with rice, peas, ham and is so moist it drips with a homemade sofrito sauce."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! To start with, the staff is great. they're very friendly and come around often to check on you. The owner is really nice and pleasant and we had a very nice conversation with him. Now the food, Awesome!!! We tried a variety of empanadas and they were all great. The Jalapeno one was especially good. The dessert empanada fig cheese and caramel was delicious!  This place is wonderful! We will definitely be back and we highly recommend that you try it!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Gave  4 starts for the service or lack of service. Took about 20min just to get our drink order in. And every time we need something we had to find somebody who worked there."}
{"text":"Solid empanadas. Not too big and have a nice crust. They had a list of stuff that didn't necessarily strike my interest at the time, but I wouldn't mind trying them in the future. The green sauce though was wonderful. But the sauce does overpower the rest of the meal. The Maduros were solid as well. They had a crusty black edge, but they could have been a little softer. The filling inside the empanadas were OK, but I couldnt help feeling it could have used more seasoning or flavor in general. Maybe its the steam that hinders the flavors but overall its not a bad place to check out."}
{"text":"Called in for takeout tonight and was super excited to try this place out. I'm vegetarian and ordered the vegan platter which comes with one empanada. On the website the menu said it came with a potato empanada, but when I called the woman I spoke with asked if I wanted the potato or 'pura vida'. I asked which she would recommend, she said go with the pura vida if I like mushrooms. Ok! Picked up, drove 15 min home, bit in, and it was chicken and mushrooms. Great. Gave it to my husband and had no savory empanada but had fortunately ordered a couple dessert empanadas, the fig was to die for! The sides with the platter were great so I wasn't totally screwed for dinner, but if you're vegetarian or vegan make sure you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"Good food.. Grossly over priced.. with tip $35 for 4 empanadas rice and beans and 1 drink!!"}
{"text":"As out of town visitors, we were glad to try something different.  I wondered if the empanadas (fried dough after all) would be heavy.  Not at all.  The chicken empanada was delicious with the sauce and so was the bean and cheese empanada.  Definitely add the green sauce to your whole meal- it livened up even the rice and beans on the side.  Great interior."}
{"text":"Wanted something different and delicious and I got it!  Was very impressed by the variety of empanadas offered and they were all delicious. Don't leave without having a dessert empanada. I had the banana cream pie it was was warm and delicious.   Service was great as well despite a busy dining room. Not a lot of tables inside but they do have an open patio."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place.  Great environment and the food is even better.  Great service and friendly owner.  Whole family enjoyed it even my vegetarian daughter had a wide selection of choices.  Only down side is it can get crowded and a little wait for table.  But once our food came it was worth the wait.  We were so stuffed that we couldn't try the deserts but can't wit to go back and try some.  Might have to sneak over for lunch on Friday."}
{"text":"What a great spot for lunch or dinner!  There are few, if any, other restaurants in the metro Phoenix area that offer authentic empanadas, so it's a real draw.  The filling flavors are fantastic!  A friend and I split three flavors, so we could each get a sense for how they tasted.  The Greek and Cubana were very good, but the El Capitan was out of this world!  If I had a wish list, it would be a lighter, flakier crust.  I've had Argentinian empanadas before and these seemed crunchier by comparison.  I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu like Yucca fries ... and some other empanada flavors!"}
{"text":"This might be apocryphal but many in Latin America claim that God didn't rest on the 7th day, he celebrated by creating the empanada. A few visits to Republica Empanada and you will become a true believer to this sentiment.  While the place might have a serious hipster facade the owners behind the scenes are the genuine real article.  It's this type of restaurant that Yelp was made for.  Plan on making a few visits because you'll want to sample everything."}
{"text":"Loved!! Yuca Fritas were delicious. Pernil (slow roasted pork shoulder) was amazing. Also did the Cubano and jalapeño popper. Classic marg was also great. Loved the wait staff; all around great lunch!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here with friends three times, and each time the empanadas have been supreme, and the beer selection good. I love bringing new people here. The jalapeño and the caramel mozzarella dessert empanadas are the beeest... At times, they have a $20 special for two beers and four empanadas perfect for a small dinner or large snack. And the staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is unique. Food is excellent, service could not get any better. Flavors are awesome!"}
{"text":"The Arroz con Pollo is the best I ever had. The portion is huge can feed two however once you taste it, you're not going to want to share it with anyone (Serious)."}
{"text":"Empanada platter for lunch. It was excellent. Chicken empanadas, really fresh and on the plate fried plantains, white rice, black beans and a fresh slaw. $14 and well worth it. Nice clean place with a big community table and about six other tables. Order at the counter. They have a few different empanadas. Looking forward to the next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Been there twice and haven't been disappointed.  The staff and owner Edmundo are so cordial.  I was having an overwhelming day.  Sorting through different emotions.  Took my self for a celebration dinner for the purchase of a new car and closing a chapter in my life.  I couldn't be happier with my choice, the empanada platter, delicious!! Stop by, you won't be disappointed.  They have a wonderful garden and if you go before it's busy you can sit out and read a book and enjoy a good meal,  it's serene."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I lived in Costa Rica for a couple years and haven't had a decent Gallopinto until now. I can't wait to try everything on the menu.   Great local eatery for anyone looking to have great food that captures Central America."}
{"text":"Stopped for the first time two weeks ago after seeing the menu posted at Costco of all places!  Ordered the lunch special combo with the Greek, Mushroom Chicken and a 3rd Jalapeno Popper.  First and third were very tasty -- second was good but I would try something different next time more challenging.  The décor was nice and the staff did a great job.  I'll visit again soon for lunch!"}
{"text":"In the words of those great poets Hall & Oates, \"you make my (empanada) dreams come true.\"  Pretty sure that song was written after partaking in some crispy delicious empanadas. Cue the cartoon animals and backup dancers because Republica Empanada makes my heart flutter into an imaginary musical number complete with jazz hands.  There are so many delicious empanadas to choose from: Pernil (house speciality), El Capitian (ground beef, potato, egg, olive, raisins), Greek (spinach, feta, tomato, olive) and Cubana (pernil, ham, mozzarella, pickle). My favorite has to be, hands down, the Jalapeño Popper, which is now offered in 3 different varieties (ham, potato, and black bean). Just like how the world-altering super food \"The Cronut\" combined two beloved items: croissants and donuts. Now comes the Empeñopa...Jalapeñada...still working on the name...The Jalapeño Empanada: fulfilling both the craving for jalapeño poppers and empanadas at the same time!  Inside the establishment it can get pretty loud so if the weather is right, you can enjoy lunch outside on the nice shaded patio. Do remember to keep in mind that these pastry babies are freshly deep fried when you order them so they are HOT! I repeat: H-O-T! Too HOT to handle. So while it might be extremely tempting, please do not bite right into to them or risk loosing you taste buds for a period of time.  The service is always spectacular and the lunch special is a great value: two empanadas, rice, beans, and a cabbage salad for $7.95! Save room for some Papas Fritas (fresh cut fries with house seasoning). Those savory, golden tan, potato-y goodness treats are dangerously addicting. You'll get them to share amongst you and your friends but quickly regret not getting a basket all for your very own.    Republica Empanada, I know I (my stomach) will never be the same now that I have met you!"}
{"text":"We got a few different kinds, but we had to try the special Sonoran Dog empanadas. My daughter got the veggie Sonoran dog. When she bit into hers, and there were hot dog slices in there. I tried one for her, and determined that it was too good to be a veggie dog, so I called the restaurant (we got our order to go). I was informed that yes, they are veggie dogs in there, and yes they are that good. Any place that has a  veggie Sonoran dog, even if only for a limited time, that tastes that good... deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was really expecting this place to be amazing but the empanadas were really disappointing. The dry, cracker-like crust was the biggest problem. The fillings were okay and the fries were great, but for a place that specializes in empanadas, it was really dissapointing."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance, and I loved the music playlist.  The green salsa was delicious.  We had a variety of empenadas and they were all great.  The wait staff was super helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, high quality food and a great overall value.  Loved the ambience of the patio as well.  We will be going back anytime we travel to Mesa. Great find thanks to Yelp."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews, Dear Husband and I had to try it.  I ordered the jalapeño popper with black beans. It had great flavor but was a bit heavy for me.  I also ordered the mushroom chicken which was super moist and incredibly delicious.   DH had the republica chicken, I tries a bite and thought it was good but preferred my mushroom one better. My husband also ordered the Boricua which generally enjoyed.  All the pandas are served with a yummy jalapeño spread with just enough kick for most.  We on the other hand love everything overly spicy. Weaker if hey had any house hot sauce but sadly only tobasco or Cholula were our options.  We also ordered the combo caribe which is quite filling.  My personal favorite are the sweet maduros where as my husband loves the yuca frita.  Even though this is quite the drive for us, we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, great empanadas both authentic like the Capitán and more Americanized like the Buffalo Chicken!"}
{"text":"Tastes like good home cooking.  I tried the El Capitan (ground beef) and Pernil (pork) Empanadas and they both tasted hearty and healthy.  I felt great afterward too.  A solid 4-stars."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices and ridiculous portions. The tostones fried plantains were awesome and has just the right texture. You can taste the freshness in everything they make. The only thing I would improve on would be service and even that barely needs work. The staff was friendly and attentive, I think we caught them on an off night lol. I'm a server so I notice the little things. All in all, the food holds on it's own. With 2 appetizers, 2 big ass meals and a brew for my guy the bill was only 37! Could barely fit the leftovers in the 2 to go boxes... Give this a go if you're in the neighborhood for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place is, without a doubt, one of the best places to eat in Mesa. The empanadas platter is filled with everything you need to make your decision on your first visit. It comes with two empanadas of your choice, rice, beans and maduros.   I recommend the Cubans and the Jalapeno Ham popper. It's got a little bit of a kick but still incredibly delicious. My favorite part of the platter are the maduros. They are ripe plantains that have been fried to perfection! Dip them in their creama sauce and you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Kick-ass hole in the wall. A must try. Different concept done well. Nutella banana empenada.. delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Stop here and get the El Capitain, bean and cheese, Pernil, chicken with black beans and rice. Ate every bit of it. Even our 11 year old loved it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a \"value foodie\" and this is my favorite affordable restaurant in Phoenix area. Atmosphere and food are great and menu is diverse enough to please everyone.   My favorite empanadas are the Cubana, Ham Popper (with cheese and jalapeño!), Pernil, and the sweet Fig! (It's out of this world.)   I'm currently hooked on the Arroz con Pollo... (rice dish.)  And the world was made a better place with their one-of-a-kind green salsa! (add at least two to Arroz con Pollo! I always pay extra for extra sauce for home!)  Bonus: RE's chicken verde soup is a new fave and a perfect substitute for cold remedy. Fresh, hearty and dy-no-mighty!"}
{"text":"I'm Latina and these empanadas are great!!! The dough is a very nice: crispy outside and soft inside, flour based, not oily at all.   Really good. Loved the fact they mark the paper bags so you don't only know what you eating but also use the paperbags to hold them while you are eating. My \"guttural\" choices didn't disappoint at all:  Pernil: great Latin pulled pork El Capitan: well seasoned ground beef Boriqua: authentic arroz con guandules Cubana: great shredded (ropa vieja) beef  Had to order the second Pernil Empanada before I left !! Oh! And don't forget to spread the cilantro salsa on your empanadas!! I also order lime and add a little to any beef-stuffed empanadas. That's a family thing. Totally coming back here."}
{"text":"The empanadas are hard to find in Phoenix but this location makes the trip worth wild. Lunch specials are better because they are expensive.  Served two empanadas with green sauce and frijoles and arroz.  If they would drop prices I would buy dozen at a time.   I approve."}
{"text":"Amazing find! Empanadas here are amazing, I would have posted a picture of them but I was too busy eating them!  Nice staff, perfect food, good chill music at the perfect volume that you don't have to speak loudly over. Yum yum come get some!"}
{"text":"***Disclaimer: Several acquaintances have highly recommended this place, plus the reviews here made me want to give it a try. I probably had more than high expectations*** I ordered a total of 4 dishes (1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 1 sweet empanada for desert)  -Appetizer Yuca frita: it was well cooked and crispy, as it should be, accompanied by a delicious white dipping sauce that I wanted to almost drink it out of the container. This yuca and all the other appetizers seem overpriced to me, but I understand all good restaurants have to make their money somehow to be able to serve fresh delicious food, so at that moment I felt like the price was justified for what was to come. Entrees:  -Gallo Pinto: it was a giant pile of rice and beans with garnish vegetables and it looked really good; however, it didn't have much flavor and there was clumps of white rice in it which only means that the cook didn't really know how to make it, or didn't care for it to be made right.  -Arroz con pollo: another big pile of rice with vegetables and chicken which DID have lots of flavor, yet by the looks of hard-over-cooked strings of chicken and dried vegetables, one could say that this arroz con pollo was NOT freshly made. It probably was sitting in a rice cooker from the day before, or even frozen and thawed out for the day. This dish came with a cabbage salad on top which I truly enjoyed until I found a HAIR on it. I tried to pull it out and pretend nothing happen, but the hair was so long that was rolled around the whole salad  so at that point I had to go call the waitress (we set outside and the staff seemed to be mainly focused on the inside tables) and she offered to give me a new plate and take it off from the bill. I didn't want a new plate, just more salad with no hair.  -Dessert:  Sweet plantain and cheese empanada: This a truly the highlight. Where I'm from, the empanada dough is made from scratch, stuffed, and then baked or deep fried. All the flavors inside of the empanadas blend together... the cheese melts while the dough cooks on the outside... so when you take a bite at it, or cut it in half,  it's a surprise every time... like \"a box of chocolates\"... with this said, this empanada here was not like any other I ever pictured or had before. It was a hollow-air-empanada-shaped-like dough which was baked by itself, cut in half, and then stuffed with dried cooked plantains,  two chunks of cream cheese, and some powder sugar on top. It could have been taken apart and put back together... like a sandwich. The surprise factor was completely left out, and obviously there was no blended flavors in it.   Due to all these 4 dishes and my overall experience I decided to give 1 star for the good salsas/dipping sauces, and another star to the waitress who tried to make it right and apologized for the \"hairy\" situation."}
{"text":"Another fantastic dining experience here.  We all ordered a bunch of savory and sweets and enjoyed them all.  I loved the Dizzy Fig and the ham jalapeño popper is always a favorite.  My husband loved the Ruiz's Pieces."}
{"text":"This is a gem. This is by far one of best places you've never heard of and should try. Actually going there tonight and can't wait."}
{"text":"The rating is mostly because the single-threaded wait staff was so kind and busted his butt! The empanadas were okay. We each had one sweet and one savory which was enough for a meal. One kiddo had the Boricua and the PB-Nutella. Her savory Boricua was stuffed with flavorful pork,l and rice. Other kiddo had the Greek empanada and the Guava-Cheese. The Greek was good but doesn't have anything inside that really binds the filling together so it falls out easily. The sweet Guava one was different. I think the jam could be thinned with guava juice so there's an even consistency if the flavor in each bite. I had the Potato Popper which was the table favorite and had the Banana-Nutella sweet empeñada. For that one, if the bananas were chopped smaller and not sliced so thick there would be a better mash-up of bananas and gooey Nutella.  We went here on a recommendation and are in town for an event at the Kino Aquatics Center. I'd recommend to others but will test some other empeñada places while we're in town."}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is a fun a different spot, didn't disappoint with its offerings.  Why go there: It's empanadas. One of those things you can get a few of, share with friends and try a bunch of different flavors. They have some good samplers available if you have never had that type of Latin American fare.  All were fairly well executed, the portions were fair for the price, they have tons exotic and domestic beers available with your meal. They greet with you with a jalapeño cilantro sauce that'll be a key accompaniment to your meal!  Don't miss:  The Yucca fries were excellent. Surely a time consuming treat to make yourself, their plantains were also very well done. The chicken empanada was filled well and very tasty.  Overall: All stuffing is made in house, though the shells are not. Though the place is great for something different. The stuff inside was somewhat tame on flavor, but the sauces you get with it helps everything. Neat place, friendly staff, nice little dining room and patio."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been several times with my mom after playing golf and it always hits the spot. The ham and jalapeño empanada is my favorite but haven't had one I don't like. We typically split the combo plate with 2 empanadas, rice, beans and a little lettuce/salad. The green side they give you which is some type of cilantro mix is to die for. I put it on everything. Love the artwork outside and very cozy inside!"}
{"text":"I was curious as to what this place was about in reading the types of empanadas they had there so I decided to venture forth and try it out. When I arrive there was one waitress on staff and about 10 people sitting at tables..I counted because she told me I would be seated momentarily and ended up waiting a little over 10 minutes to be seated. I sat down on the sofa then got back up and stood right next to the 'please wait to be seated sign' to make sure I was not forgotten. Once she saw me stand up she walked over to me and took my order since it was to go. I almost felt sorry for her as they were behind on orders and there was no help for her. I ordered the Boricua empanada and was not disappointed at all!! They were extremely delicious (surprisingly since I never ate an empanada with arroz con gandules). Highly recommend this place. It's cute and cozy. I think it was just a day they were short staffed. Looking forward to go again when I get back out to Arizona."}
{"text":"Busy Friday night and Republica is as loud as a junior high lunch room. It was so noisy we couldn't hear our server and I don't think she could hear us because I wound up with an order of Papas Fritas that I thought was included in the dinner special as an appetizer. They served it after we were well into the meal so we were puzzled when it showed up. They were generously seasoned with rosemary. I had a black bean salad which was large and fresh. My partner had a special that included 2 empanadas which he thought were OK. Skip the Reisling at $6 for a juice glass size and the glass was warm. We thought it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Number of times visited? 2 Would I come back? Nope  Prior to coming here, I heard plenty of good things about this place on Yelp and Thrillist.  I'm a big fan of empanadas so I was looking forward to coming here.    I've been twice so far and have been unsatisfied both times.   The first time I came, I ordered the chicken empanada and the Cubano with the rice and beans.  The shells of the empanadas are good. Crunchy and hard.  But the fillings are underwheliming.  The chicken was forgettable.  It was underseasoned and not very flavorful.  The Cubano was better but the fillings seemed unevenly distributed.  Pork on one half, ham and cheese on the other. The second time I came was a worse experience.  After being seated, the host asked if we were ready to order but we weren't. After that, it took about 25 min for someone to take our order.  No one even came back to check.  4 other couples came in after us and had their orders taken and some were already eating before our orders were even taken.   We eventually ordered the El capitan, the caramel apple empanada, and the jalapeño popper with salted ham.  The El capitan was decent, it had ground beef, eggs, potatoes and green olives.  The consistency was a little pasty and mushy though.  The jalapeño popper was better. It was salty, spicy and fatty.  I'd recommended it if someone was going here. The waitress forgot to place the order for the caramel apple empanada so she brought it out late. I wish she didn't remember it though.  It was like a bad apple pie. It was dry, with no caramel in sight. Sadly, McDonald's apple pies are better in my opinion.    Overall, I expected alot from this place after all the hype and just from the fact that it's an empanada restaurant.  Empanadas are fucking awesome.  But not here. Very disappointed and wouldn't come back. Having a a shitty staff experience just solidified my decision not to eat here again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend recently moved to Arizona and has been going out checking out all the Happy Hour spots and came across this little Gem. Me being from the Bay Area I've had my fair share of Empanadas but never had anything like this. This place is legit and worth it.  It was Crispy and fully filled like it should be.  We basically had the Flight that comes with 3 Empanadas and 3 beers.  The Cubano, Anchotè, The Popper, Pernil & Cheeseburger Empanadas were on hit!  My mouth is watering just writing this review.  My pics tell it all.  Def be coming back"}
{"text":"We went here for a date night. The staff was friendly. The place is clean and trendy decor. We had the yucca fries. They were pretty good with the dipping sauce. I ended up keeping the fry sauce to pour over my empanada. It was better with a sauce.  The empanadas were tasty but really small. My friend ordered the platter where she got 2 empanadas, salad, and plantains. I think I will do that next time. Just the empanadas al a carte isn't enough to fill you. They should make them double the size and change double and offer a couple sauce choices.   We had a longer wait time and it wasn't very busy when we got there. Not sure what took our food so long. It was a pretty good overall experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like this place and have been here a couple of times. The empanadas and drinks are great and the staff is nice. I'm not a fan of the 2 big TVs that are playing unless there's a huge game on and would prefer for the music to have more Latin influence. It's a nice small and comfortable place with yummy food and we will definitely  go back."}
{"text":"This place was clean, friendly, had amazing murals on some of the walls, but on top of that the food was soooooo good!  It hit the spot and I will definitely be going back for more.  I got the Empanada plate with two different empanadas with rice, beans, lettuce and two different side sauces."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My boyfriend and I went out to eat here for the first time with a few friends over the weekend and the food was phenomenal! I would highly recommend the empanada platter, it comes with two empanadas (of your choice) as well as rice, beans and some fried banana. These were the best empanadas any of us had ever had, the Cubana and the Boricua were total hits! We also ordered dessert empanadas afterwards, the plantain & cheese were amazing!!! They are considerably small, not something share worthy.  Though the food was amazing, the service was a little rough. Our server made us feel very rushed and showed her stress. Once it got close to closing time she was definitely trying to get everyone out, asking to clear everyone's plates as we were still eating."}
{"text":"So delicious! Everything we ordered was fabulous. Super good black beans and rice and the pork and the potato empanadas are amazing. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place is kinda hip BUT the empanadas were not good. I had both the Cubana and the beef.. plus they're $4 each for a really small piece!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't see what all the fuss is about. My first sign that this place might not be for me was the fact that there were no Mexicans eating there (I'm Caucasian BTW) I've noticed that most \"Mexican\" food places with fancy  and modern decorations and ambiance are usually overpriced and the food is not spicy at all. I ordered a Cuban empanada and it was kind of dry and there wasn't hardly any meat in it. The empanadas are very small too. I ordered a second empanada and downed that but I ended up eating somewhere else right after we left this place because I was still really hungry. My wife loved the decor inside but didn't care for the food either. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you like Cornish Pasty AND Mexican food, then you have to try this place! There are a good variety of sweet and savory empanadas, which are cooked fresh and served hot!  Today was my first time dining at República and there was a lunch special: 2 empanadas, rice, black beans, and cabbage salad all for under $10. Great deal! I'll be back to try the other varieties. :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more.  Perhaps my experience with home made empanadas from a variety of sources growing up makes me more critical than the average yelper for this type of food.  We tried the fried appetizer.  It had a fried yukon, tostones (non ripe platanos) and platanos.  Having spent a few years in Puerto Rico where these are served quite commonly I would say it was okay.  I tried the chicken and beef empanadas along with a meal that included rice, beans and another forgettable side.  The filling on the empanadas was generous.  However, they seemed to lack spice and flavor.  They were actually quite bland for my taste.  The highlight of the meal was the fig and cheese empanadas.  If I go back to this restaurant it will be to enjoy this dessert again.  For the low price of the meal you really can't go wrong.  But some of the reviews claiming they serve the best empanadas are a bit over inflated in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are looking for a light meal/appetizers and a good drink selection off the beaten path. Come in a catch a game while eating some tasty Empanadas with a few friends.  We were looking for a lighter meal close to home with the kids. Between my husband, 2 sons, and myself we tried the Yuca fries (way tasty!). My youngest son (9) had a cheeseburger empanadas and loved it. Older son (11) was more adventurous with the Pernil and he was very pleased with it, commented on the very flavorful pork. The hubs got the Captain, Cubana, and Boricua. He loved them all and the Toña beer was a perfect match with it. We were loving everything.....until we ordered dessert- The King, Nutella and banana, and Dizzy Fig. It took so long for the desserts to come out (well over 20 mins) and they came to our table pretty cold. I'm pretty sure they sat on the counter ready to go out to us for at least 10 mins. I would have asked the waitress if it was our order but she was no where to be found.   All in all, it was pretty good but I would not recommend coming here if you are in a hurry or super hungry. But if you come with time to spare you will love it!"}
{"text":"Very good crust, lackluster filling (I had the chicken and the pernil empanadas). Don't know why the pernil is so hyped, it lacks flavor and is too watery. For the same price I've had better empanadas. Price is still reasonable though, and again the crust is good.   I'd come back especially since this place is within walking distance of the Mesa Arts Center, so it's an excellent spot for a quick bite and maybe a beer (beer list is pretty decent) before attending a concert."}
{"text":"While the food was good, not oh my goodness this is heaven, but pretty different empanadas, I don't think I'll ever come back. Reason is, the wait for these little bites (I say bites because the empanadas can't be bigger 3inches) is RIDICULOUS. we waited about 45 minutes to get our first order and since it was our first time we didn't order much (1 each). Once we tried them and decided we wanted more, we ordered another round of them and those took about another 30 minutes to come out. By that time, we hadn't been offered refills on our drinks or explained why the wait was soooo long. We ordered two to go as soon as the second order came out figuring maybe by the time we finished and paid it would be ready but we had to wait an additional 15 after that. Most of us were in the car by then. There was probably 3 or 4 tables being served by two servers, at most.  All in all, good food, not coming back though. Im not dying to try an empanada that comes w such long wait time and bad service."}
{"text":"We've seen this place advertised and I believe they were on Guy's DDD show as well.  OMG is about all we can say...these are the bomb!  It's not a big place but had no problem getting seated when we arrived.  There is a big community table and as I walked in, I checked out some of the dishes that were being eaten...everything looked so good!  When I saw the Arroz con Pollo on the menu, I had to order because I'm a sucker for a good plate of rice and chicken.  And of course, we had to order a variety of empanadas because that is what we were there for!  We ordered the Anchiote Potato (potato, annatto seed seasoning), Greek (spinich, feta, sun dried tomato & kalamata olive), Pura Vida (can't remember ingredients), and Pernil (roasted pig) and of course we had to also try two dessert ones (The King-banana & peanut butter and The Dizzy Fig-figs, mozzarella and dulce de leche).   The roast pig is my favorite, with pork that was moist and flavorful.  The Arroz was very good but I have had better.  Makes sense...we were there for the empanadas and that is where they shine!  The dough used for these is soft and cooked to perfection.  Every one of the fillings were their own unique flavor and all were stuffed full.  What a great experience!  The staff were so friendly and offered some great suggestions.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"My oldest daughter and I met up with a friend and her daughter for dinner , the placed picked Republica Empanada.  We walked in and where greeted right away, and our server was Heidi, who was amazing & helpful!    For starters I ordered Tostones, fried green plantains severed with creama and this amazing cilantro jalapeno ranch sauce, this was a great starter, I loved it, the plantains where cooked perfectly and the combination of the creama & cilantro jalapeno ranch sauce was perfect! They flowed well with each other, so good!  Now they do offer sweet & savory empanadas, and for the savory I went with the Republica Chicken and the Cubana.  The Cubana was slow roasted pork, ham, mozzarella & dill pickle, it was very tasty, I enjoyed it very much. The Republica Chicken was chicken & veggies with some seasoning. OMG AMAZING!! I need to try out the rest of the savory ones, but right now the Republica Chicken is my fav!!   Now for the sweet!!! I ordered the fig, cheese & caramel & Nutella & banana.  The fig empanada had figs, mozzarella and South American style Dulce de Leche, this was amazing, I loved the combinations of everything! Figs, Cheese and Caramel, yes please!   The Nutella & Banana AAAAAMMMMMMAAAAZZZZZIIIIINNNNNGGGGGG!!! I am a Nutella loving fool, love that stuff, and this empanada was perfect!! So so good!!!  I enjoyed everything I had tried and everything is so reasonably priced, didn't even break the bank account for everything! Great service and great food look forward to coming back and trying more empanadas out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to try republic empanada I went with a friend who knew the different empanadas to order.  We did try the cheeseburger empanada and also the ham and cheese empanada they were very good.  We also got a sampler platter of the appetizers and they were very good and hot. The green sauce that you dip everything and is absolutely delicious asked for extra if you really like it.  This is a great place to stop by for empanadas."}
{"text":"We went to a concert at the Mesa Art Center and went to dinner here before the show. We are so glad that we did! The food was delicious, if you like empanadas you will have a great selection. I loved the El Capitan. We also had both of their salads which were very fresh and delicious. The beer selection was good and we had wine. The wine was warmer than it should have been but was still good. The restaurant itself was really cute and mod. We enjoyed sitting on the covered patio watching the hummingbirds buzz around. Service was friendly and good. I highly recommend Empanadas Republica."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. Such a cute vibe and delicious margaritas and empenadas. The customer service was beyond amazing and refreshing. You immediately feel like family. I look forward to having our wedding reception there."}
{"text":"I am so excited to call this a Mesa restaurant! We have returned a couple times and have had wonderful times each visit! What to expect:  - full flavor - tender meat - CHOICES (my husband is a big fan of choices) - cozy atmosphere - live music some nights - YUMMY desserts (my favorite part of any meal)  We will continue to come back and hope foodies looking for a new spot will give this one a try!"}
{"text":"Ok, Sometimes you find a hole in the wall restaurant that is truly amazing.  This is one of those places. Had a great waiter and the food was truly amazing.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB.COM! Go there you will not be disappointed! The straight up cheese empanada takes you to the streets of Chile! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Writing this and thinking about this place is making my mouth water. I LOVE Republica! So unique and so delicious! Some of my fave empanadas are: Jalapeno Popper, Cubano and the Buffalo Chicken. You MUST try them with the green sauce. Best I have ever had. Not sure if they put crack in it or what, it's Goooood!   The fries are something you can't leave without trying. They have the best fries in town, hands down. I could go on and on. There's nothing that I have not loved! And the place itself is so swanky and cool.   This is the perfect spot to impress a date!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place! I love this location, the genuine staff, the amazing food. The interior isn't what you'd call amazing but the fact that it's an old bank turned into a tasty restaurant somehow makes me happy. It has quaint charm.  We ordered four times, no joke. I tried the Cubana, and the bean and cheese empanadas. Then for dessert, we ordered not one, not two, but three of the fig, mozzarella, and dolce de leche empanadas. Oh my. They were incredible. I never would have put that flavor combo together, but it worked so well. So delicious, we all loved it.  The papas fritas were so delicious. Whatever that dipping sauce was is amazing. Will definitely go again, and order everything."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Friendly service and excellent meal.  Will return here when I come back to Tempe!"}
{"text":"4-star food, 2-star service. Been here 3 times, but sadly, the third time was not the charm.   To be clear, the food is really good. Empanadas are terrific. The Boricua, Pernil, Chicken & Veggie and Potato are standouts. It's not easy to find Gallo Pinto in town, and theirs is really good. Soups are rich and flavorful. Tostones and maduras are delightful.  The service, however, goes back-and-forth between indifferent and poor. Last Saturday night, it was a server who only came over 10 minutes after we were seated, and only someone in our party practically grabbed her. Place was about 2/3 full, so that wasn't the issue. We ordered appetizers (soup) and entrees. After 15 minutes, the soup hadn't arrived, so we asked her how they were coming along. \"Oh, it's coming, they're making it now\". Um, I don't believe that they are making soup on an order-by-order basis. Literally 30 seconds after she walked away, a 2nd server brought over our entrees, and we still didn't have the appetizers. So we canceled one of them, and she acted all pissy. Sadly, not that different from the last time we were there, when we arrived at 6:00 (on a weeknight, half full), told them we needed to be out the door at 7:15, and were served our entrees at 7:00.  Love the food, but I'm done with dining in. Maybe for take out..."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! Simple and delicious. Pick your two empanadas and it comes with rice, black beans, and cabage salad. Afordable. The place is modern and love that they have a couch to relax after finishing your meal. Customer service great."}
{"text":"República Empanada was a nightmare. The FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. The SERVICE REALLY BAD. We waited a long time before they took our order, and the place was empty on a Saturday 2pm. There was only one more family in a table that was being served by the two waitresses, and we were completely ignored. I complained to the manager in regards to the food and service. She only said sorry, and didn't even care. I wouldn't recomend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The pernil, Republica chicken, and the potato cream cheese jalapeño empanadas are my favorites. The fillings are all so good--tender meat, great spices, amazing flavors. I also love their cilantro-jalapeño green sauce with them. I just wish they'd give you a little more of it. They also have Mexican coke, which is my favorite.   The restaurant is simple and a little spartan, but I like the wall mural. I really like their outdoor covered patio in the evenings as well (fall and winter mainly). The one complaint I have is that the empanadas aren't very big, so I think the price is a little high for their size. But they are very delicious, so I will still come back."}
{"text":"Man you gotta try the empanadas here, sit in the community garden and enjoy the flavors they offer."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials! The Pernil empanada is to die for!"}
{"text":"After coming here a while back with some girlfriends I was excited to bring my husband.  Unfortunately our experience was less than stellar. First we waited 10 minutes to be seated. Not because all the tables were full but because one person was doing all the hosting, waitressing, and bussing herself.  Once we were seated another waitress mysteriously appeared and took our drink order. We weren't quite ready to order food so she said she'd give us a minute. 30 minutes later we had to track someone down to take our order.  We ordered the combo caribe appetizer platter and 2 empanada platters.  We both wanted a jalapeño popper empanada and we were told they were out of all 3 varieties.  Bummer. So we found something else appetizing to order.  While we waited for our food we noticed the restaurant had a line out the door but only 2-3 occupied tables.  I started feeling frustrated for those people who stood there waiting for 20 minutes or more while the restaurant sat mostly empty. I wanted to tell them the experience wouldn't be much better once they were seated.  We received our appetizer that was just ok.  Then the waitress came over to let my husband know that they were now also out of the pura vida which is what he ordered instead of the jalapeño popper.  By this time we had been there an hour and just wanted to be done. He told the waitress to just surprise him with a replacement.  We got our food in fine time. It was ok. Kind of bland. I liked my meal more than my husband liked his.  Also the first time I was here the dipping sauces were delicious.  This time they just tasted like warm ranch dressing. My husband said he thought they were disgusting. We also noticed that most tables approached the front bar for their check since service was already taking so long.    I gave it two stars because I liked my food. But I think if it were up to my husband he would give them negative two stars.   Side note, we brought our 5 month old with us and we were disappointed that they didn't have a changing table in the restroom.  My husband had to go change her diaper in the car while we waited for our food. It is my opinion that food and health inspection start requiring them for all restaurants. It helps your patrons be sanitary."}
{"text":"Yum! Hubby and I met a couple friends for dinner and they were blown away. The empanadas were delicious, crispy and freshly made. We ordered 8 different empanadas and some beer and then after a while, another round.  We were a bit disappointed they didn't have a huge selection of Latin beers but what they had wasn't too bad. We stay past the 9pm closing time. No one encouraged us to leave but the crew was packed and ready. Since we hadn't seen our friends in a long time we completely lost track of time. Our tab wasn't too bad considering we had about 16 empanadas, 2 glasses of wine, and 6 beers. On our way out, the owner introduced himself and thanked us for our business. He also apologized they for their early hours. All in all, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Boricua, Pura Vida and Guava mozzarella empanadas were all delicious!!! Black beans and white rice very flavorful."}
{"text":"The wait time in this place is to die for. I mean it, you'll be dead before you ever get seated or have any food. The hostess told us it would be 15 minutes to be seated. Forty minutes pass and we have yet to see the hostess return. I look around and see table after table of happy customers, who have no food on their tables. The bell from the kitchen only dinged twice while we were waiting. So I guess they are getting to an entire three tables an hour, yipee.   The only thing this place serves are air tacos."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great.  I had their pulled pork sandwich (I can't remember what they called it).  Its really good.  I put their green sauce all over it.  Its one of the best sandwiches I have ever had."}
{"text":"Try alot of them. Cheeseburger republica chicken japeno popper. Cubana  all were excellent.  Buffalo chicken pass on that one . Ewww"}
{"text":"Headed here with the husband and a friend for the first time last night and fell in love with this place! The parking lot was a little tight to navigate, but there is plenty of street parking surrounding this location, so don't fret!  We headed in to this eclectically designed venue and opted for a high top table since all the regular tables were taken up with patrons and it was a little too hot out to enjoy the patio seating. Fortunately we made it in time to squeeze in a happy hour drink order before the 7 p.m. end - $1 off wine and beer. I hoped for Sangria, but they didn't have any, however, they said they were working on getting it in, so fingers crossed for next visit!  My husband and I both ordered the dinner platter since it came with maduros, rice, black beans and salad, along with the choice of 2 empanadas. We had the El Capitan, Pernil, Chicken Republica, and Boricua - then we cut each in half and shared them between each other, so we both got to try 4 varieties! The maduros were delicious and cooked perfectly.  I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite between the 4 empanadas we tried, I'd order them all again in a heart beat.   When we walked in we noted that they had dessert empanadas, and knew that this just had to happen, so we \"saved room\" for them (read as attempted to save room, really didn't have room, but ordered them anyways, cause...dessert.)  We had the King and the Fig.  I would probably say I preferred the fig over the King, but both were great!    Overall: A A smaller restaurant (max seating of 49 people) that gives off an intimate artsy vibe with great food and nice staff! Happy hour from 3-7 daily!"}
{"text":"Hit his place before a concert at the Mesa Arts Center.  Seriously, the best empanada that I've ever had.  Got the El Capitan and the the chicken veggies empanadas.  The outer skin is nice and thin - not super thick and doughy like a lot of other places.   The restaurant has a laid back vibe.  The service is excellent.  We had about 45 minutes to eat and had entrees and dessert out in no time.  One of the owners, Marco was there waiting tables and making sure guests had everything they needed.  I think it's really nice when the owners help with the day to day and make sure all of the details are taken care of.  Will definitely be back when we see our next concert at the Mesa Arts Center."}
{"text":"Awesome Empanadas & the sweet plantains were delicious as well. The girl working the counter was very courteous & friendly. Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing Empanadas at this small family owned and run business. I had the lunch special! Two empanadas from their daily selection, rice, black beans and cabbage salad. I opted for water but they have an excellent drink selection including bottled Mexican coke.  The girl at the counter was very pleasant and our order arrived quickly.  They hold a special place in my heart as they have a brick proudly displayed of my Jr. High that was demolished this year. A true treasure indeed.  Come support a local small business and eat some great food.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very good Pan Latin American food. Great empanadas, as we had Cubano and Columbian. The Arroz Columbia was excellent too. A bit expensive for what you get, but delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like it. Service was outstanding. Simple menu. Sleek and stylish decor. It's a beautiful addition to downtown Mesa. ER has so much potential! I had a lovely chat with the owner, Edmundo, who told us about his family, him being from Mexico and his wife from Costa Rica. The beautiful mural on the wall represents his family. It's awesome! You can tell there is a lot of love and passion behind this business. I also liked the fact that the owner was so friendly and open to suggestions and feedback.  I was so very excited for ER to open since I lived in Chile for a year and ate empanadas nearly everyday. We ordered the El Capitan (it sounded the closest to the traditional Chilean empanadas I loved), and the Cubana. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the El Capitan. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting I guess. Cubana was very good.   They also had a really good lunch special. It was $7.50 for 2 empanadas, a side of beans, rice, and salad.(I think). Excited for them to get their liquor license and start offering local craft beers!  I think ER has a lot of potential. Will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"If you go here, I recommend just getting one of everything. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is well matched. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Republica I desperately wanted to love you... We came in on Saturday night about 7:45. The restaurant was about 25% full but it took 15 mins to seat us. We ordered the papas fritas, and were saddened to get limp fries. We both ordered platters and the food was good, but don't think we will be back. Highlights included the green sauce on the table (jalapeño, cilantro salsa) and the jalapeño popper empanada. The Cubano gets an honera me mention."}
{"text":"Today tried a seasonal special, pork enchiladas. They were incredibly good! Spicy red sauce was perfect. My wife, the hot fan, loved the jalapeno popper. Have yet to try anything here that isn't excellent!"}
{"text":"Best place around - absolutely delicious!! Personally, I think the Cubana is the best but go try them all - they're all great!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointment with this place, I will not going back, they don't make the discos to make the empanadas,it seems that they just got them from Lee Lee marquet and very expensive. I went to Argentina's empanadas in Rocky Point and it was so good because they make the own masa."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious! The chicken empanada is very tasty. Indoor and outdoor seating and the family/staff is very welcoming. My only gripe for not giving 5 stars is it is only open until 9pm and that's just unheard of for a restaurant. We wanted to stay and order more but they were closing all around us. The empanadas do not come with sides and they are very cheap price wise, they could charge double which would still be 8.00 or less and then throw in sides and charge 12+. I'll go back for sure and tell people to head over as well, just wish they were open extended hours."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my first time having an empanada. I got the Vegan Platter. It was soooooo good! I will be returning here in the future. The food is satisfying, but not too heavy or greasy. The gentleman at the counter also served those at the tables, and he was wonderful. This is a must go to place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere, the service and the food! Highly recommend! Thankful they had real vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and super cute!! I love the food, so delish! I got the Rupublicia chicken empanada, (which is like a marinated shredded chicken). I paired it with their awesome black beans. So yummy. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Empanadas.  Menu has such a nice variety, something to please everyone. Restaurant sits on a corner and reminds me of a quaint coffee house.  Staff is warm and friendly.  I picked this place based on the reviews from fellow yelpers and I love empanadas. Please know they are not cheap and they are not big.  Cost for two was $7.89, but worth it fresh and frabjous."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw the review on Check Please! Arizona. (If you're not watching Check Please, you really need to. We've discovered so many great places in the valley.)   Republics Empanada is a small white building on the corner of Hibbert & 1st Ave. We wouldn't have noticed it if we weren't looking for it.   The restaurant itself isn't very big. There is a long high top table in the middle and regular cafe tables along the walls. They have brunch on the weekends and the day we went there was a DJ playing music. I usually don't like it when a DJ is playing during the day but I didn't mind it that day. I'm not sure if it was a regular event or because there was a large group meeting there.   When we arrived we were seated right away. Their staff share the host and wait staff responsibilities and I think every waiter it waitress who was working that day checked on is at one point. They had a special brunch menu on top of their regular menu. Since we hadn't been there before we asked our waitress what she recommended. She suggested the Combo Caribe appetizer to start which had two kinds of plantains and yucca fries. I wasn't sure what to think of the yucca but that ended up being my favorite! They were really crispy and seasoned with salt & pepper. The combo came with two sauces - crema and a jalapeno ranch?, I think. The jalapeno one was so good!!! The plantains came maduros and tostones. The maduros were standard plantains roasted in honey or syrup. The tostones were kind of mashed plantain cakes that were crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. These were my second favorite.   The empanadas are small and you order them individually so you can get as many or as few as you want. I filled up on the appetizer so I got the Achiote Potato and my boyfriend got the Cubana, Republica Chicken and I think the Pernil. He ate them all so quickly I guess he had no complaints. I overlooked that the brunch menu had a egg & potato Empanada so we will have to go back for brunch. The Achiote Potato was very good. I thought it would be spicier but I was glad it wasn't. The crust on the Empanada was nice and crispy. I expected them to be greasier because I think they're fried but they weren't greasy at all.   For desert we got the apple & caramel Empanada. It was good but a little underwhelming. I thought it would have more caramel than it did. Next time we'll try the Dizzy Fig and the Guava & Cheese.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Sadly I cannot even come close to rating the quality of the food. After waiting an hour and a half for our food to arrive we had to leave. The order was lost. The extremely disappointing part was that no one seemed to notice nor care that we did not have our food, even after initially questioning the status of our food. Only after our pointed insistence did we find that our order was lost and there was no hope of even be able to eat dinner. We had to leave for a show that was starting so waiting was not an option. A consolation of a gift card was offered and although we have it in hand I am doubting it will be used any time soon. The failures experienced had some easy resolutions that could have been employed along the way. The first and easiest is ensuring the staff maintain situational awareness of  of the customers, if someone has been there a while and there is no food check on them. When a new system has just been deployed, the excuse given in this case, double up on making sure things are working and double check everything. Also revert to the one mentioned before, maintain situational awareness. When a customer mentions being there an hour and still does not have their food take it seriously and check on it and then get back with the customer with an update. Don't just go to the computer, talk with people and then resume normal activity without providing an updated and ignoring every attempt by the customer to get your attention. Sadly this was a very terrible experience and I have no desire to return to give it another try for a very long time."}
{"text":"Great taste but the combo was not worth the cost. I recommend ordering 3-4 empanadas, specifically the jalapeño poppers. The atmosphere is an indie modern take with upbeat songs from a cultured era. Definitely a hole in the wall to visit"}
{"text":"Love to eat in their patio, there is a flower garden next to it. Really nice. My favorite empanadas is Greek. Chicken and mushroom very good too"}
{"text":"This is the greatest little gem! Just happened to come across it!  Definitely a must!! I'm quite sad I'm from out of state and can't have this on a weekly basic"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food in a great atmosphere! Melody was our server and she was great!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place and it was delicious! Also super affordable :)"}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I stopped by for the first time today for lunch. Lots of parking and the place looks clean from the outside. We walk in and the seating and decor is very cool. Signs direct you to how to place an order. There was lunch special that was $7.95 for two empanadas, rice, beans and cabbage salad. I ordered the special and a Coke Zero in the 12oz can. I was getting ready to pay the bill so my order could start and realized my Coke can was being charged at $2.00 and I had to ask to make sure. The girl said yes and since I was already rung up I went along with my $10.59 lunch special.  My friends and I sat down and our food was brought to us.The plate presentation was excellent. The food flavors were really good. We walked away feeling comfortable.  I would have like a 12oz can for less than $2.00 and empanadas to be a little larger to feel the total value package to earn 5 stars. I will try next time take out or the $20 beer and empanada special."}
{"text":"My review:  Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.    The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.  Tonight I had a variety of items.  Yum!  Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious, scrumptious empanadas!  Great lunch specials!  Fabulous restaurant!  Fast and friendly service!  NUFF SAID! *drops microphone and walks away*"}
{"text":"Ever since the boyfriend and I discovered empanadas in New York we have been dreaming of finding something comparable close to home. Enter Republica Empanada.  When we saw the menu online we got excited because there were a variety of options, many quite similar to what we had experienced in NYC. Our expectations were high and Republica Empanada did not disappoint. We both ordered the lunch special - 2 empanadas, rice, beans and salad for $7.50. I chose the Hawaiian and the El Capitan, both were very, very good. The shell was done just right - crispy but not greasy. And there was plenty of filling with a good ratio of ingredients. They served them with a spicy cilantro sauce on a side that definitely had a kick but was very tasty. The rice and beans, though simple, were flavorful and a nice complement to the empanadas.   The place itself is clean, contemporary and comfortable. The staff was very pleasant and helpful explaining the menu options.  One thing to watch out for when going there - they are on First AVE. Apple maps will take you to First STREET (thanks a lot SIRI!) So watch out for that.  I can't wait to go back and try a few of the other flavors. This is sure to become a regular place for us."}
{"text":"Great new gem in downtown Mesa! Light, flaky delicious empanadas. One person can have 2-3 and still have room for a dessert empanada. I had the Boricua, El Capitán and the Cubano. All equally delicious and honest to their menu descriptions. Good bottled beer selection and the restaurant was clean, tidy and modern. The service was attentive and friendly. So happy to see a good and unique restaurant in Mesa."}
{"text":"Great place with a great vibe and delicious empanadas!  We must have tried 10 flavors between the 4 of us and they were all amazing!  The ranch/ cilantro dressing with a few items (salads and appetizers) was also amazing.  Very interesting flavor combos for the empenadas and delicious flaky crust.  Superb!  Great new find for me!  Oh and I love the stamps to label everything!  And the beautiful mural and all the cactus.  Its a creative place!"}
{"text":"Oh dear. Do you give one start or two for AMAZING food, but horrible service? Make sure in advance that they allow dogs on the patio, great, they do. Get there just after noon. No wait! Score. Patio it is. Yes, it's warm out, but the patio is covered and it's just me so it's not like I'll be here all day. Haha. Get seated, would you like something to drink? Water and a drink menu. Five minutes later someone asks if I've been helped. Another minute or two...here's my water...no drink menu. Order food and drink. Food comes out in a reasonable time...too bad my order is wrong. I purposely ordered nothing with meat, got a chicken not cheese. No big deal. I'm sure they'll replace it. Except...I had eaten all of my first empanada, my rice, drank my mimosa, and most of my water BEFORE anyone asked me if my meal was good. Finally someone does, tells me they'll bring me a water and the cheese empanada. A good ten minutes goes by before someone comes out and asks again how everything is (still no more water!). Um... I order another mimosa. (Great, now I'm spending money and calories just because my food is taking forever). A table next to me, who sat down just before my food originally came, is already done eating. Wow. When someone messes up your order, your replacement should come STAT. I wait approximately 40 minutes (thank God I brought a book!) before I give up. I've been here for almost two hours at this point, and all I've had to eat was one empanada and some rice. Oddly enough, when I say I can't wait anymore I suddenly have my check and my empanada is ready and wrapped to go. This visit literally ruined my morning, because I was sooo excited to come here and try this place. They are also donating 15% to Mesa Urban Garden today. AWESOME! Food is amazing...but geeez....don't come here unless you have 2 hours to kill? Or, no appetite. Unfortunately for me, that wasn't the case. They did take off the price of the 2nd empanada...but seriously.......seriously. :("}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Was made to wait a long time for seating, although the restaurant was nearly empty. Then we were seated in the worst seats in the house, right next to the area where people congregate (and are forced to wait a curiously long time) for seating, with other patrons bumping into us and crowding around our table so we couldn't even hold a conversation. Staff was running around like they were over worked when there were hardly any customers. I could see a manager try to step in to help her servers, but her \"help\" seemed to be more for show and she didn't even bring enough menus to the table she was trying to help, forcing them to share awkwardly. We couldn't wait forever for our server to ask her to move us to a different table, all the while getting surrounded by other waiting patrons who weren't being seated, so we moved ourselves (not something we'd normally do, but when some dude's butt bumps your shoulders for the third time, you take action!). I'd heard they have gluten free and dairy free options, but upon reviewing the menu there was only one dish I could eat. I realize I'm hard to feed so I was happy there was an option for me. But that option, Gallo Pinto, was described as black beans and rice with tomatoes and avocado. It came with two thin, tiny slices each of tomato and avocado as garnish atop a large portion of beans and rice. A good portion size but not really a meal, not really very tasty, kind of a cop out menu item really. My meal was something I would've made a more tasty version of at home. My husband very much enjoyed his chicken empanada but the ham one he was not happy with.  Overall, the servers lacked friendliness, hustle, and didn't really seem to care about doing a good job. I would not return and I would not recommend. Total waste of time and money. The decor was attractive and the space was nice, I wanted to like it, too bad about all the rest."}
{"text":"Had the El Captain, Cubano, and the Fig/caramel/mozzarella. All were super yum. $11+ A bit pricey for the size."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because it was on Diners,  Drive- ins and Dives and got the food that he ate there which was delicious but have to say the dessert called the Dizzy Fig was my favorite thing. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Why are you on YELP reading about this place and NOT eating here? Holy balls, this place is amazzzzzing. I have single-handedly converted a small army of people to adoring this place. Really, it's all fab, except for the Buffalo Empanada. The ham and cheese is fabulous, the black bean salad to die for, the fig and cheese empanada my BFF. Plus, BOTH my kids eat whatever the get here. Go here now."}
{"text":"Finding myself Mesa, the allure of highly rated Republica Empanada was too temping to pass up. On arrival, the location was questionable but stepping inside I was reminded to not judge a book by its cover. Striking a fine balance between trendy while retaining the feel of a family ran business."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here every couple of months with my son for an early dinner.  The empanadas are fresh and always tasty. They often have specials--I loved the pumpkin empanada dessert--and a nice beer selection. Waitstaff are very friendly and helpful. I really hope this place thrives!"}
{"text":"Great service, reasonable prices , and an excellent variety of Spanish dishes. I also enjoyed the local beer selection. There's a couple of delicious vegetarian options (not your ordinary salad and veggie burger options either).  I am anxious to go back again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Arroz Con Pollo and especially liked the jalapeño popper and the cubana empanadas. Many  craft beers to choose from. Crew was extremely nice and made us feel welcome.  Very clean and relaxed environment. Republica Empanada is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I found myself in Mesa for a conference and was disappointed in the \"downtown\" food options. I am so happy that I found Republica Empanada early during my week because I went there many, many times. There are so many choices, and not just with the empanadas. You can get a heaping bowl of rice, or down a platter full of deep fried goodness, or be responsible with a hearty vegan salad. The waitstaff and the owner were so, so nice when I was there with a huge group. Wish I could take this restaurant home with me."}
{"text":"Two MUST HAVES!!! 1.  Pernil Torta - The best shredded pork ever topped with tomato, avocado, slaw, and chipotle may AMAZING 2.  Fig Carmel Empanada - Sound bizarre but has the perfect balance of fruit, cheese, and carmel, let me tell you this will melt in your mouth  5 Stars this place is excellent!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little restaurant. Most of their menu are different empanadas which are meat half pies. We had four different types but I can't remember what their names were but they were delicious. We are definitely going back again.  I understand from the owner that were filmed for Diners, drive thrus and dives!"}
{"text":"This is my 516th review and I finally found what a true 1 star experience is.  I've given 1 star before but now I feel bad for those other places because Republica Empanada takes the 1-star cake.    I'll say I was excited to try this place based upon the reviews and the unique food options.  When we arrived there were about 10 people or so waiting for tables ahead of us.  We were told 20 minutes.  No problem.  20 minutes passes.  Then 30.  Then 40.  \"You're table is ready, we're cleaning it off now!\"  Great!  At this point another customer walked up and asked when they'd be seated.  The hostess comes back to us and, not kidding, says \"I'm going to seat them and then you'll be next.\"  What???  I'm not going to make a scene so I take her at her word that we'll be next.  10 more minutes pass.  Then 20.  We're finally called up and to my shock most of the tables in the restaurant are empty when we're sat.  What exactly were we waiting for?    At this point I just want to get on with my evening so we order immediately. We ask for four empanadas and the tostones to be brought out together.  Flash forward 10 minutes to the tostones being brought out sans empanadas.  Fine, I'll eat those first.  They're basically wet discs of plantain and were clearly fried in oil that wasn't hot enough.  Yum.   Around this point my attention is drawn to a waitress who is yelling at a cook.  She's asking \"Who are these for???\" while holding a plate with 4 empanadas.  I have a good idea who those are for.  She says she needs a to-go order and then, not knowing who's food this is, throws those empanadas in a bag and sends the to-go customer on their way.  The same waitress then awkwardly makes her way over to our table a minute later (she wasn't our waitress) and with a \"please don't ask me any questions\" look on her face tells us our food should be out shortly.    Eventually it comes out.  It's fine.     We hastily pay the bill and head for the door of the still 80% empty restaurant.  What do we find?  About 20 people waiting for a table. It's like the employees were plucked out of a Walmart and told \"you're running a restaurant tonight...go!\"    If you must, get a to-go order.  If you don't have to, don't."}
{"text":"Overrated. Trendy exotic does not flavorful food make. One time try and done."}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is an excellent little establishment that, despite being located in Mesa, would fit in perfectly with all of the hipster \"foodie\" joints in Central Phoenix.  As the name states, this place serves empanadas. Pretty damned good ones, too. So if that's not your thing, I wouldn't bother coming here. I prefer getting the platter, which allows you to pick any two empanadas, which also includes rice, beans, and some excellent maduros. The pernil is decent, although it's just one boatload of meat. I suggest ordering it in its boricua form to make it a little more interesting. The republica chicken is high quality, but strangely enough, my favorite out of all of them is the basic cheese.  We've tried two dessert empanadas that both delivered. The fail-safe combination of banana and nutella, as well as the The King, which as expected, includes peanut butter and banana. With the option of adding ice cream and drizzle, you can't really go wrong with either choice.  As some other reviewers have noted, service seems a bit off. Normally, I overlook this when the food is good, but this is a situation where I just can't give them a full five stars. The servers are always hobnobbing to the point where we've had to physically go to the counter and ask for our bill, boxes, and even request desserts. They rarely come to check on you, to the point where if you need something, you simply just have to go up and ask for it. What's the point in providing a tip?  Be warned, the food's aroma will completely seep into your clothing, to the point where you can still smell it on our clothes and skin hours after leaving. It reminds me of my days working fast food as a teenager in the sense that, when I get home, the first thing I want to do is take a shower. This is probably due to the fact that everything is fried, while the kitchen setup doesn't really provide much of a barrier. I mean, the food is great, but I don't want to walk around smelling like an empanada all night.  Despite these issues, we really enjoy the food here to the point where it's become one of our preferred locations whenever we venture into Mesa.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The empanadas, though small, are very tasty. We had pernil, Puerto Rican and banana Nutella. Yummy! The black beans are good too. Very friendly staff. Nice outside seating with a pleasant water fountain masking city sounds. Bucket list from Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. He does not disappoint."}
{"text":"While temporarily living in the Mesa area for purposes of business I walked down to this restaurant from our unit. My day off, walking dog stopped in to get a menu. The restaurant inside was stuffy, hot and dark. I waited a long time for the host to help me but she would just look in my direction and bustle another way. I didn't have my reading glasses on so I took a paper menu on a clipboard thinking it was a menu. Finally after a lot of disgusting looks and ignoring from her she came over asked me what I wanted and I asked her for a menu to take out. I wasn't dressed to stay in or go out on the patio....so I just wanted to look it over. I asked her if the one I was holding was the take out menu and she snatched it out of my hands as if it were gold and said in a nasty tone this is the \"drinks\" menu. Oh ok...no problem. She didn't have to be so nasty.. I asked her if dogs were allowed for the patio dining and she didn't even want to seem to speak. She shook her head yes as if it were menacing to have to even answer. She looked me over the minute I came in and decided since I was dressed down I was not worthy of seating or speaking to. Too bad she treats people like this based on her stereotypical assumption. At 75 K a year, 2 businesses of my own, retired from government after 30 years with a nice pension and possess a Master's degree from a top military university-perhaps she should be careful about who she judges? The patio area seems fine but after that encounter wouldn't eat there if you paid me. If one of my employees ever treated anyone like that-they would be promptly let go for cause. She can take her dirty tattered little beverage menu back and put it on the same clipboard I took it from. Her body language suggests she thinks it is beneath her to deal with the public let alone someone dressed down casual on their day off. Chill little girl, this isn't exactly the east coast, its not even Scottsdale or Paradise Valley.....its downtown Mesa so not everyone looks like money and sometimes you have to dress for where you are. She is about 30, short dark hair, maybe 120 pounds, very light complexion-so watch out if you go she can be quite rude. Oh by the way, the food on the menu is pricey and there isn't much variety. I am surprised by positive reviews here, perhaps they are rigged with friends or family of the restaurant?? or maybe they just didn't have to deal with her??"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about. The empanadas are mediocre lacking any authenticity and flavor. Also the staff did not seem very well trained. We will not return."}
{"text":"Be careful not to get a dessert empanada 'a la mode'. For two very small scoops of your run-of-the-mill vanilla ice cream we paid an extra $6! I was shocked and disappointed. The empanadas are good. But the service is poor."}
{"text":"Great job! Good service and excellent food. We've had several of the empanadas on the menu and they were all hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The coconut porter was really good and the yucca fries were amazing! I had the chicken empanada and my husband had the beef and the mushroom and chicken and everything was divine. The sauces are all great compliments to the food. I have actually been to South America and I know authentic empanadas. We will definitely be returning! Also the caramel fig empanada is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was fine. The empanadas I find to be very small and quite pricey! It's my second time having empanadas it was in salt lake. So this was a disappointment! For over 50 for my family I don't find this to be a $ restaurant. Also had to wait very long for my order. And made the order for there and not to go. The girl taking our order was clueless in regards to the product. We asked her a few questions which she had no answer to. And lastly the policy that they support the initiative to pay minimum wage and charge me a surcharge is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The Jalapeno Popper one was good and the Cuban one was excellent.  The guava and cheese one was also decent. The chicken on was ok.  Cute little restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  Walk up and order and then sit down and they bring your food to you."}
{"text":"So we came out on Thursday to test it out and make sure it was as good as they said (guy)......and it was !!! We are back today it's Friday and this place is jumping. Greatest vibe ever"}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in downtown mesa that is saturated by subs and Mexican food. This place is clean, not to expensive ( good lunch deals), and just something totally new. The hamburger and slow cooked pork is heaven. I don't usually eat dessert but the fig, mascarpone, and caramel is a home run that would even impress Babe Ruth. If you're in the area, try it!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good!  I got the vegan platter and was not disappointed.  I love the green sauce they give you and the papas fritas were delicious. For dessert I highly recommend the dizzy fig empanada. The service was fantastic and the restaurant was spotless. Definitely a downtown Mesa must."}
{"text":"The food is a 5 star and so is service.  However, the prices I would give a 3 star.  But, it's what the market will bear and since there really is no competition in this market, with great food, and an okay location, they can charge these prices.  I was looking on my mobile Entertainment app and found this little hole in the wall place.  We went here Friday night and while driving there in the dark (about 6:30 pm), my husband was a bit leery about going here because it was on the edge of a residential area, dark, and didn't look that great from the outside.  He asked me why I always chose places like this and I told him that some of these types of places have the greatest food, and it doesn't taste like it's a chain thing.    He felt nervous parking because the area didn't look too great.  But I assured him we were going to be alright.  He comes from Colombian and usually places that look like this or areas that look like this meant danger - people with guns, being killed or some other bad thing happening to you.  I said it's really not the same here, at least not in Mesa and this wasn't really a bad area, just not well lit.  When we went in, the place was very urban looking, quaint urban, trendy.  It was really very nice.  It's not a big place and really more for couples.  I don't see how you could have a large group here, though, unless you combine all the tables together and closed down the place for only that small party.  But, it was perfect for my husband's and my date night.    We started off with Tostones ($6.50), which is like Colombian Patacones.  It came with a Jalapeno Ranch Dressing.  They also gave us their House Salsa, which looked more like a Green Salsa.  My husband is NOT a saucy type person, but he loved by the Jalapeno Dressing and the Green Salsa.  They were super yummy.  They made the Tostones thicker than we made our Patacones and they came out piping hot and fresh, made from non-ripe plantains (very green plantains).  Yum.  We started off with 2 empanadas each.  My husband ordered the Pernil and the Chicken ($3.50) empanadas.  I ordered the Boricua ($3.75) and the Cubana ($3.75).  We tasted each other's empanadas and all were yummy.  My husband really loved the Boricua, which is the Pernil with rice, peas, ham.  The Pernil ($3.75) is a slow roasted pork.  The Cubana is the Pernil, ham, mozzarella, and dill pickle.  The Cubana was by far the tastiest one and I think the dill gives it that really special flavor.  Since these empanadas were so yummy, we ordered 3 more, 2 more Boricua for my husband and the Cheese ($3.50) one for me.  My husband said these empanadas reminded him of Colombia, which he loves and misses the food.   The size of these empanadas were 3-4\" in diameter.  The empanada dough, I believe, is made with regular flour, so it's light.  They were not made with white corn flour, which would have made them much heavier.  I prefer the white corn flour instead, but this was also delish.  My husband said they serve both kinds in Colombian.  Despite me thinking these empanadas were overpriced, they were yummy with good service and ambiance.  We will be back with our kids, which we know they'll enjoy.  At that point, we'll probably be ordering 20.  LOL.  The mobile Entertainment gives you 25% off your total bill, which is really good because these are so pricey.  But if cost is not an issue, then by all means.  Food, service, ambiance is great!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Great food nice clean casual atmosphere. You can even get a beer with you lunch! If you haven't tried it you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem!  Surprisingly they were not busy when I went today at 12:45. I was seated right away and drinks order taken.   The staff is so friendly. The service quick. Our order was out about ten minutes after placing it.   Between my daughter and I we ordered five empenadas. Hawaiian, ham n cheese, jalepeno popper and  el capitain. For dessert we had the nutella and banana.  We were so excited to try the dessert that we dug in and forgot to take a picture. Darn it. But it was so good I highly recommend trying it.  The shells were cooked to perfection. Light, golden and crispy.  My favorite was jalepeno popper and Hawaiian.   Great place. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Republica Empanada 204 E. 1st Avenue Mesa 85210  We arrived at the restaurant at 6:00 and were seated in a few minutes. We were asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. By 6:15 we understood why a reservation is a good thing since the place was packed.  Companions 1 & 2 and myself started off with an order of Maduros (Sweet Plantains), and companion 3 started with Tostones (Unripe Plantains that are deep fried and salted). The Maduros were beautifully cooked and came with some crema. Delightfully sweet and slightly chewy they were a real hit. Companion 3's Tostones were cooked properly, but companion felt they were a little dry. A loan of some of our crema solved the situation nicely.  Since they had so many varieties of Empanada's on the menu, we ordered a large assortment. The Pernil (pork shoulder) was perfectly cooked with wonderful flavor, and the Mushroom Chicken was so good that extra was ordered to take home. The Boricua was very tasty having been cooked in a Sofrito sauce along with a ham hock. The Ham and Mozzarella cheese was tasty if not a bit unusual. One of our party was a vegetarian and was pleased that the menu had a nice amount of dishes that were compatible with that life style.  Next, on to the dessert empanadas.  Once again, we ordered an assortment to try. The Fig with Mozzarella and Dulce de Leche was outstanding, as was the Plantain and Crème Cheese. The Guava preserve and Mozzarella had a wonderful strawberry flavor that was quite intense, especially since it was ordered with Ice Cream and Whipped Cream. We also ordered the Banana Crème Empanada as well as the Baked Apple and Caramel Empanada.  We couldn't leave without ordering some extra to take home. We left with several bags with more Maduros, Mushroom Chicken, and Plantain and Crème Cheese. Other companions also took home doggy bags which will not be touched by any dog if it knows what is good for itself.  The place is kept spotless, and fortunately only had one television on the wall which was showing the soccer game.  Service was reasonably quick considering how many people were there, and was always with a smile!  Prices are what can only be described as cheap, with most items in the area of $3.75. My suggestion would be to make a reservation, then run, don't walk to get there and prepare to stuff yourself. It is rare for me to give 5 stars to a little restaurant that doesn't have a fancy interior, but this is an exception I gladly make.  5 stars for outstanding food, great prices, good sanitation, and the wonderful smiles."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and worth the drive if you don't live in Mesa. Everything was good and one thing that surprised me was how delicious their dessert empanada of fig, mozzarella cheese and dulce de Leche was. I highly recommend ending in that one."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday evening. Service was great but food was just OK! The bill was $ 35. and change for two people for dinner and appetizer's not including the tip.$ 2.50 for a bottle of coke, yikes! Probably would not go back considering price, portions and taste of food."}
{"text":"I'm being nice,  over priced under whelmed!  average if that...   I am from Miami, I know good Empanada's and  Palle'a ,,,  this was just not good,  The owner was nice, but that doesn't  really matter if the food stinks, although I  appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"If you're willing to make the drive and are looking for some good Latin comfort food, this is your place! Giving four stars because of the horrible service, but the food makes this place well worth it. The Combo Caribe appetizer is a good start for newbies. The empanadas are cooked absolutely perfect with just the right amount of crust and are not dripping in grease like so many places. I like the al a carte option so you can choose a few to try. Their sweet empanada options are also a must try. The dizzy fig has figs, mozzarella, and dulce de leche- Great sweet and savory mix for after dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Mesa!  Great location in downtown Mesa!  They have Delicious emapanadas and employees here are friendly.  Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We loved it. Our teenager said that the cheeseburger and papas fritas were better than any hamburger he had ever eaten. El Capitan and the Boricua were tasty, the prices were reasonable and the service excellent."}
{"text":"Not sure what to think of this place. It's good, but not worth the price I paid for the small empanadas. You will have to order three pieces or a platter with sides if you are starved to make it worth it. The empanadas are minuscule about the size of a small child's fist which is perfect for me, so two pieces usually fill me up. I ordered them with an ice tea, and my bill came up to $14 including tips. Rather high to tell you the truth, so it's better to get here during lunch hours, and have the lunch specials.  Still giving it four stars since I'm a fan of its originality. They have different varieties of empanadas here from sweet and savory to vegan and spicy. I took a menu to go so that I can see the ingredients of the empanadas. They are easy to make, so I am going to make some at home.  No Glutton Free, so don't come here looking for something that can accommodate your diet. There's enough parking space here both inside the lot, and street parking. I can't say much about the inside of the restaurant, however.  If you don't mind sitting outside on the patio, they can probably accommodate larger groups.  It's near the light rail in Mesa, but you have to walk a block to 1st Avenue.   NEAREST LIGHT RAIL: Center and Main"}
{"text":"Best service and food in Mesa. Period. Accommodating, down to earth. Great staff, ambience and menu. Loved it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the verdict is in: this place rocks! It's affordable, close to home, friendly, cozy, and unique. Oh, did I mention the food is great too? The Popper flavor was my favorite but honestly I didn't find one I didn't like and we must have tried about half the menu. Me and mine will definitely be back to try everything at least once."}
{"text":"The empenadas here are quite tasty.  However, I found that they were quite small for what you pay for.  I'm always looking to get the best tasting food for my buck and Republica Empanada fell short.  I'm glad I gave them a try, but I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Republica Empanada is a place I had been, but my wife had not.  Today she finally got to try it.  We both had Empanada Platters, but chose very different empanadas.  They all look the same on the outside, but are very different on the inside.  My wife tried the Mushroom Chicken and the Boricua, and really liked them both.  I had the Pernil and the Greek and was also happy with my choices.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and I'm so happy I went out of my way to try this place. My sister, daughter and I shared a bunch of items on the menu and left very satisfied! We had the Combo Caribe for an appetizer, then shared the Chicken, Cheeseburger, Cheese, Boricua, Greek and Jalapeño Popper Empanadas(Chicken and Cheeseburger came with rice and beans for the lunch special). We were stuffed at this point but decided to indulge in the Fig Cheese and Caramel, and Cheese with Guava dessert empanadas both topped with ice cream and chocolate.... Everything was amazing! Reasonably priced, service was fast and friendly even though they were busy for lunch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service & prime location near the Mesa Drive Light Rail station on Main Street. Perfect place to hangout on happy hours."}
{"text":"The cheese empanadas were delicious and the green salsa that comes with it is amazing. I plan on eating there again."}
{"text":"My ode to Rupert Holmes's song \"Escape\" (The pina colada song) is as follows:  Yes, I like Republica Empanada And getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food I am into (fried) plantains  OK I don't really like getting caught in the rain but the rest holds true! I tried some yuca frita and several empanadas. I went into a food coma shortly afterwards. Then I woke up and wrote this review. :)  The yuca frita were lightly crispy with great starchy flavor. I love them as an alternative to your standard French fries. I wasn't a big fan of the ranch it was served with though, it tasted weird to me. We had the Republica chicken, El Capitan, chicken and mushroom and cheeseburger empanadas. My favorites were the El Capitan and the Republica chicken. The mushroom and chicken came in a close third. The cheeseburger, while technically tasting like a cheeseburger, was the sort of novelty filling you get but then realize you'd rather be eating a regular cheeseburger over this version. The empanada crust itself was great: crispy yet slightly tender, cooked until golden brown.  Service was friendly but a bit sluggish. The iced teas we ordered were refreshing and came in a gigantic cup.  The parking lot is small but there is street parking along the restaurant.  If I'm in the area again I'll definitely stop by for more empanadas and maybe some fried plantains. :)  P.S. I always thought the pina colada song was sung by Jimmy Buffett until I did a Wikipedia search today!"}
{"text":"We just love this place so much. Love having a delicious and cool spot to go here in Mesa! The owner is rad and loves his patrons, he's passionate about Mesa and good food. Lunch time is a great time to go and get the special. Lots of food for a great price. The worst part about RE is having to choose what to get! My absolute favorite thing is the bean and cheese Empanada and their yuca frita dipped in their jalapeño ranch (you have to ask for it). If you're with a group, get the caribe platter as an appetizer. My husband is obsessed with the pork torta smothered in their green salsa and the jalapeño ranch. The fries it comes with are YUM and I'm always stealing some. We also love the potato Empanada and the Nutella dessert Empanada. If you're interested in a salad the black bean one is my fave. You guys, GO, support Mesa and make your belly happy. Then go for a stroll in the urban garden next door :)"}
{"text":"Great menu! The staff was friendly and helpful. Delicious Empanadas and the soup was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. El Capitan is my favorite and the closest to Argentine empeñadas though all of them are kind of a medley of south and Central American flavors. I also love the fried mandioca (yucca root)"}
{"text":"This place is really authentic and crazy good.  One of my New Years Resolutions is to make sure to eat at Republica Empanada every time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide on which empanada to try so we ordered one of each.  Check out the menu or just listen to the server. They'll tell you what's the best selling empanadas.   authentic and flavorful.    I like how the simple food was made to order and just made my tastes buds happy.   This place is not in the nicest part of town but worth checking out for a different kind of flavor.    Casual and come hang out and enjoy empanadas of many flavors."}
{"text":"Yes!!!!! Thank you, Republica Empanada!  I first heard of this place at the Sips and Sweets event this past summer. I sampled some of the sweet empanadas and the one with the figs in it made me obsessed.  I finally made it to the actual restaurant a few weeks ago and ordered several savory empanadas, along with some tostones as an appetizer. Everything was delicious and the prices are so great. You can order a bunch of empanadas and try a bunch. They are the perfect size to sample and share.  I didn't order the Gallo pinto, but I am so pumped it's on the menu. I studied abroad in Costa Rica my senior year of college and this tasty dish is something I really miss. I'm definitely ordering it next time (just had to go with all the empanadas the very first time, you know?).  The service was great, and they also have a pretty solid beer list. So, nothing to complain about here!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hip little place within walking distance of the last stop on the new light rail extension to Mesa. The offer a wide variety of empanadas, which are little hand held pastries that have various fillings and are then fried. Good selection of beers in the bottle but nothing, thus far, on draft and that is something they may wan to consider, if they have room, as this is definitely beer friendly food.   My friend and I also had the combo appetizer platter with both the fried ripe plantains and the smashed and fried green ones - came with some good good sour cream like dipping sauce but my favorite sauce was the spicy green sort of salsa like sauce - seemed to go good on everything.  I finished the meal with the fig, cheese and caramel empanada - not quite as exciting as I thought it would be (I would prefer fig jam in it versus whole dried figs) but glad I got it with the ice cream. I'm not a big desert person so will probably stick with just the savory versus the sweet ones in the future.   The best deal seems to be their Monday and Tuesday evening specials - any four beers and any four empanadas for only $20 - which is about a $30 discount when you take into account the beer at happy hour prices ($4 a bottle).   I will definitely be back to this place - especially as the weather cools down and you can sit outside on their nice patio.; -)"}
{"text":"I have to say! Pernil empanadas are my favorite and if I could I would eat there every single day. Neat place, nice people, good prices, delicious food, I am sold for life. oh and I forgot that green salsa they have is the best I have tried, I can't even make it that good and I cook pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place, I was expecting more of a traditional Mexican empanada, because of the restaurant name, but it was definitely american. I ordered the cheese empanada, and it tasted like the bagged American cheese, not what I was expecting but it wasn't too bad. Atmosphere was very nice though."}
{"text":"If the revitalization efforts  of Mesa's downtown restoration succeed, places like Republic Empanada can take a lot of the credit.   Briefly, a comfy cozy place with hip music and good solid food, albeit, mostly empanadas. The decor try's a little hard, but I applaud the effort. The light fixtures are awesome and I love the couch."}
{"text":"I called 30 minutes prior to our arrival to order our 14 empanadas. Everything was made fresh and it was ready for us. We wanted to try their popular Boricua, but they were sold out, so we chose a couple others and they threw in an extra empanada for the trouble. The location was easy to find, but a little dark in the area at night. There is a lot of parking as well. The interior is cozy and I like the decor. There's also a nice outdoor patio for cooler days.  Republica Chicken ($3): Chicken, fresh vegetables, and seasonings. Good flavors and packed with chicken. One of the best ones we had.  Pernil ($3.25): Slow roasted and specially-seasoned pork. My absolute favorite of our selections. The pork was delightfully juicy and very flavorful. As with the chicken, there is a very generous serving of pork.  El Capitán ($3.25): Seasoned ground beef, potato, boiled egg, green olive, and golden raisin. I've had variations of this Argentinian classic and I'm usually a fan, but I do not like green olives and the one in this empanada was SO salty that it took away from the rest of the filling (fortunately, it was only one bite). Otherwise, it was good.  The Buffalo ($3.25): Chicken, buffalo sauce, and gorgonzola. Tasted just like a buffalo chicken pastry, nothing particularly exciting for me. Ruben is a big fan of Buffalo Chicken and he really enjoyed it.  Cubana ($3.25): Pernil, ham, mozzarella, and dill pickle.This was one of my favorites. Delicious and a great combination of flavors. I enjoyed every bite.  Mushroom Chicken ($3.25): Chicken, sautéed mushrooms, and kalamata olive. You can't really taste the mushroom in this one, so it was hard to distinguish from the Rebuplica Chicken, but with much less flavor. I also did not like the one whole kalamata olive. It would be better chopped up and dispersed throughout the filling.  Cheeseburger ($3.25): Seasoned ground beef and cheddar cheese. There was a generous amount of ground beef and it was nice. Although, the cheese was oddly non-existent.   Jalapeño Popper ($3.25): Cream cheese, grilled and seeded jalapeños, and salted ham. The ham was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed its flavor and saltiness against the mild cream cheese and jalapeños.  All empanadas are encased in a nice pastry and fried for a crispy exterior. The savory empanadas are served with their fantastic salsa verde (one of the best I've had). Overall, they're all lovely. I personally enjoy a little more doughiness in pastries, but I was really pleased with the amount of meat in the fillings. As far as flavors, it was a bit all over the place; some were more robust and some were too mild. I was disappointed by most of them. My favorites: Pernil, Republica Chicken, and Cubana."}
{"text":"The food is great...really enjoyed trying several different empanadas.  The food took a little time to come out but I guess good things take time!  Our favorites were El Capitan, Cubana and the banana cream pie was delicious as well."}
{"text":"I left a review here about a year ago and absolutely loved it...went back today and was treated so badly... We sat and the young girl who was our waitress seemed super sourly...we never even got the yummy sauces with our.empanadas until we asked for them we literally got up and found someone.. we ordered a bunch of food and the girl in the end came to tell us if we were ready for the check instead of asking if we wanted a sweet empanada or anything else I truly felt like we were inconveniencing them by being there.. thumbs down I guess I will have to make my own Argentinean empanasas and be the friendly competitor!"}
{"text":"BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE! My husband kept telling me how good this place is so for dinner last night we finally went and oh my gosh I fell in love. I am super picky when it comes to food but literally every single thing I tried, I loved. We got the fried plantains with creme for our appetizer (melts in your mouth it's so good) and then for the empanadas- my husband and I got the jalapeño popper, cheeseburger, pork empanada and a couple others. Finally for the dessert empanadas, we got the Nutella and peanut butter and the banana one. It was so good we still can't stop talking about it. Also it's a super cute place. I am obsessed with the art there and they had a really talented DJ playing some good music. Everything was perfect and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"If you've read my previous reviews, I always stop by when in the neighborhood for my fix of Empanadas which I love. Today I opted to try the Chicken Pozole with Red Broth.  The Pozole was excellent! It was a big bowl with a lot of chicken and all the add-ons. My friend had his usual Empanadas.  Service: very good, Food: Empanadas out of this world and the Pozole very good. A bit of a warning which you will catch throughout almost every ones reviews, it's not cheap, more on the pricier side. My soup was $12 though it was a big bowl and came with bread."}
{"text":"The only things I've had are the empanadas, which by the name of the place you'd think are the house specialty.  Solid,  good but nothing special.  I tried all the empanadas between my wife and I. My favorite was the boricua.  The jalapeño popper had way too much cream cheese.  Friendly service,  I think I was hearing such great things it was a letdown.  Just a small one tho"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food and service are amazing!! The aciote potato is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and fantastic. It makes me really sad that the waiters/waitresses are always apologizing for the long wait. I sat and waited nearly 35-40 min after being told twice that it would be 5-10 min. Then watch my table be ready for me for 16 min just being empty. **GREAT FOOD, EXPECT TO WAIT 1.5 HOURS FOR EVERYTHING**"}
{"text":"Food was OK. It's different than anything around so that is appetizing. I'm not a fan of ham, Green and Kalamata Olives, so that eliminates 89% of their menu for me. I tried the buffalo chicken and the cheeseburger. I'd eat the chicken one again, but the ground beef pocket I can do without.  My stars are actually for the decor, service, and beer selection.   The place would get more stars from me once they make more affordable, appetizing empanada combinations. but for someone like my dad, that likes nasty tasting olives, this may be 5 stars.  The empanadas are $3 each, but are small. good luck getting full for less than $10."}
{"text":"De-lish! Empanadas were perfectly made. Crispy pastry, delicious fillings. They even have cervezas & other drinks go enjoy with your meals. I say meals because you will not stop ordering until you explode!  Take a walk to the  library if you wanna make a good days worth of good food & Adventure:)"}
{"text":"This rating is mostly a reflection of their service but the empanadas are average at best also.  Went after the lunch rush, the place had 2 or 3 other customers. Waited to get seated, had to grab a server after sitting there over  15 minutes to place my order. The entire time The server seemed inconvenienced at my tables presence. After the food came out I realized the yucca fries were heavily seasoned with rosemary (did not describe in the menu). The green sauce is pretty good but overpowering with the empanadas. My El Capitan didn't have any egg. Not realizing how small the empanadas were I was still hungry but with the service being so bad decided against it and left hungry.  While I love empanadas and was hoping to order a sweet one, due to the rude service and mediocre food I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Super stylish, super hip, super friendly and SUPER GOOD. I never knew white rice could be so savory, and the beans were keen, too! The empanadas are just exquisite!!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend Rupublica Empanada!!! It's truly a gem of downtown Mesa!"}
{"text":"We were impressed with the freshness and quality of the ingredients. Everything was homemade, and there was great attention to detail. The server was attentive to our needs. It was reasonably priced. The food was delicious. It reminded me of my time spent in Latin America. What else could you ask for? We'll definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"Lovely interior, just enough comfort-to-hip ratio. Went there for the first time Monday night got 4 empanadas and a desert for take out. The food was delicious!!! and we will be going there to eat in next time. As I was waiting for my food I noticed that the staff were engaged and informative and customers were enjoying the atmosphere as much as the food. Go there to eat and hang out it will make a wonderful evening. Ps the food is mostly somewhat Puerto Rican & Caribbean style -ish and tastes just like you hope it will."}
{"text":"Great unique food! The Maduros or fried plantains are out of this world! Manager came by to see how we were doing. Excellent customer service and great food I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Visited several times over the years, and I've seen it go downhill. When I ate there recently, the service was more awful then usual. The wait (to order, to get food) has always been long but it's recently averaged 15 min after seating to get waitstaff attention and 35+ for food to table.  The food is decent but often hit or miss. My main complaint is that the quality and the menu are both unreliable. The printed menu and the specials board does not disclose all ingredients--beware customers with food allergies!  I was happy when Republica Empanadas opened, since the dining options in downtown Mesa are meager and mostly brewery or cookie-oriented. But I'm not sure it's worth going back."}
{"text":"this is good place.   Food home-made.    Looking at poor reviews, it is not clear how the place works.  You pick up a menu and order up front, they bring it too you.     Also note the empanadas are small, most people would eat about 3.  The key is to get a platter which has two empan's and some rice, etc.     The only thing I didn't like was they have 3% surcharge to pay higher minimum wage.  I know restaurant biz is low margin and you gotta charge what you gotta charge, but just raise prices,  Surcharges are like resort fees, deceptive in a way.  So just raise prices 3% and be up front about it (3.50 empanada goes to 3.605)."}
{"text":"Delightful empanada spot in Mesa.  I had a Saturday girls night there and was so happy with my meal.  There is ample street parking and an attached lot as well.  There are a few tables and a patio as well.  The menu has a nice selection of different empanada options as well as a few entrees. They also have cool soda flavors from Latin America. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Do you like empanadas, do you hate empanadas?  Well, whichever it is, you will love this place.  They have everything to spiced ground beef and veggies to Fig and Cheese empanadas.. also me not being a fan of Nutella, LOVES their Nutella Empanada !"}
{"text":"Only reason for a 3 star rating was due to the service, the staff seemed to be without a leader or a manager, a little latter a guy that looked like the owner or manager arrived and everything started to run a bit smother. The kitchen had everything under control but the waiters were just too slow for them, the place was busy but not enough to justify them. Still the overall food experience was pretty good. This is very trendy place with some Latin influences in the menu, mainly puertorrican. Started with the Combo caribe, good combination of tostones, maduros and yuca, comes with two sauces, one is like a ranch and the other is like a sour cream without the sour, both of the sauces seems a bit out of place, I was expecting like a MayoKetchup but the platter was good without the sauces. They also bring you like a sofrito that you can use but they seem to be using Mexican pepper in it and that added a little bit of spicyness. Then Tried the Boricua empanada, this is really good, rice with pigeon peas in it is cooked very well and the combination of flavors are awesome, great idea. Next was the Cubano, another great idea, pernil with melting cheese and dill, flavors were great. Also tried the El Capitan, their take on the ground beef empanada, flavor was good but a little too much of the green olive flavor for my liking. Will definitely be back if in the area."}
{"text":"I first heard about this restaurant through Phoenix New Times, and finally tried it out tonight. Very good food! Everything was super tasty and fresh, and the service was quite good - everyone was very attentive and knowledgeable. Everything was really reasonably priced especially when you get the special. We had the combo appetizer, a couple specials, a couple of desserts, and some sangria - loved it all! Definitely recommend trying out this great restaurant - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My niece turned me on to this place. I'm glad she did! This is great comfort food and a nice place to engage in good convo. If you're in the downtown Mesa area catching a concert, musical or hitting up first Friday, stop in here and try this place. The food is great."}
{"text":"I only give three stars due to lack of service. The food was pretty good, and the empanadas were very filling! Over all It's a pretty tasty place. I just think it's pretty pricy to be a okay food."}
{"text":"Omg love this place.  Small menu because they do what they have very well.  Had their rice dish recently and it was super good.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp a few days ago and was super excited to try it out. When in NYC I always make it a point to eat at Empanada Mama, so I was hoping this would be as good. It wasn't bad, but fell a bit short. The empanadas were hit and miss. Pernil was very bland, it just tasted like pork with no seasoning. The republica chicken was my favorite. Maduros were also pretty good!"}
{"text":"I never find myself in Mesa, strictly out of principle :D, but I was headed to the Mesa Arts Center for a concert and found this gem using my Yelp app.  The waitress was very attentive and actually apologized for asking me a question right after I took a bite (I swear they must teach that timing in the training videos at every restaurant). I had the El Capitan & the Cubana empanadas as part of the platter for dinner. Both were excellent. There was a surprisingly decent assortment of craft beer bottles to choose from as well. I was easily convinced to look at the sweet empanadas for dessert, and the waitress was quick to point out all her favorites (essentially the whole menu). I settled on the Ruiz's Pieces, because obviously I'm a sucker for a clever name.  I suppose I'll have to find an excuse to be in Mesa again soon. It will be an easy walk from the light rail as well once it's finished being built out that far."}
{"text":"The empanadas are amazing! So full of flavor and we had excellent service. A great place to go for a light snack or order more qith sides for a filling meal. Try them all. We had about 8 different ones and all of them were great. The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  A casual place to enjoy some good food and a beer. A must when in Mesa! We will be back. The price is a bit high for the size, but the flavor makes it worth every penny! My favorite was the black bean and cheese."}
{"text":"Seeing that this place had 4.5 stars with almost 500 reviews, this place looked promising. Plus, I don't get to eat empanadas very often. However, my husband and I were very disappointed in both the quality and value of the food. We ordered the El Capitan and Mushroom Chicken empanadas. If it weren't for the green sauce that they give you with them, they would've been way too bland for my taste buds. Also, we ordered a side of cabbage salad. It was not a SALAD! They just put some cabbage in a small bowl and charged $3.50 for something that probably costs 25 cents or less. No extra veggies, no dressing...just shredded cabbage.  We would have much rather bought another empanada for that price.  On a brighter note, the sweet empanadas were much more tasteful. We got the Guava and Cheese & Dizzy Fig. Out of the two, we preferred the Dizzy Fig mainly because the guava one didn't have straight up guava in it, it was more like a jam. If you're gonna do that, then write \"Guava Jam and Cheese\" on the menu so that the customer isn't more disappointed when they fail to receive the fresh guava they were imagining and getting hungry for. It was still yummy, though.   If you want to visit this place, I would skip the savory empanadas (the sweet ones are more worth it) and try something else...maybe it would be tastier??"}
{"text":"Yum yum!  Decent prices, clean, friendly and different.   We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Something so different and light but gets you full, variety of unique delicious empanadas, I recommend this place to everyone, will defiantly go back for more with friends, also the staff are soo nice! The owner was also very nice he walked up to us and asked us about the things we ordered and if we liked them. (Thumbs up)"}
{"text":"Had to stop by downtown Mesa area to drop something off and had to stop by this place since I was in the area. Very good empanadas and decent size.. just wish they had a little bit more filling but everything we ordered was pretty good.."}
{"text":"OMG we just shared six and I couldn't pick a favorite, they are all fantastic! Do yourself a favor and try this place.."}
{"text":"Love coming here!! Came today for my third time.. and just love it! They have great customer service,.. as we ate the place started too fill up.. The food is always great! The french fries are amazing.. and I always order a variety of their empanadas..  I totally recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I love everything here. You can order empanadas to get a good sample menu or go for the entrees and have dinner and lunch the next day!!! I like supporting local restaurants and this is owned by a family. You can meet the son any night of the week or if you catch the patriarch he is probably gardening in the next door community garden. Maybe off the beaten path but worth the drive for the great food!"}
{"text":"I found this on Google maps, searching for something in close proximity to Mesa Arts Center, where I attended a concert tonight.  My sister and I shared several savory empanadas, the Yuca Fritas, and one sweet empanada.  We agreed that our favorites were the Pernil and the Mushroom Chicken, although we liked all the ones we tried.  We had the Guava and Cheese for dessert, and it was delicious too.  All the empanadas were very flavorful, with a crispy (and not oily) pastry.  What a delicious concept, and it's great to share so you can try many different flavors.  The service was a little slow, especially since there weren't many people there, but the staff was very friendly.  This is a true gem in downtown Mesa.  I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu of food and drinks! Sirven Fernet!!"}
{"text":"Love Latin food so imagine my surprise to find this gem in downtown Mesa. The empanadas were amazing and the salsa (which is similar to a chimichurri) on top was off the charts. I love this place and am so glad that it is only 3 miles from my office!"}
{"text":"The food here is really solid, but the atmosphere is not good. Republica Empanada fries their empanadas, but they don't feel greasy or overly heavy. Everything comes out piping hot. The dessert empanadas are particularly stellar - this restaurant was on a list of the best restaurant desserts in the Phoenix area for their fig, cheese, and dulce de leche (caramel) empanada, and with good reason. They make the dulce de leche in house and it's phenomenal.   Unfortunately, the last time I went, it was so loud that it literally gave me a migraine. I would recommend either making a reservation to sit on the patio or just stopping by for dessert in the middle of the day when it's not so busy. The other reviews are correct about the disorganized service, but the desserts are worth it if you avoid sitting inside during peak hours."}
{"text":"I just ate here.   It is Saturday at around 3:30 so we had to order dinner menu which was more expensive.   I had the El Capitan empanadas with the dinner option.  They were OK but not great.  My husband had the Arroz con Pollo and is average too.  I really like the ambience so I'll give it another try someday,  maybe a happy hour.  They seem to have lots of beers if you like that."}
{"text":"Loved how unique this place was.  Great empanadas.  Recommend the jalapeño popper and cheeseburger.  I would order 3 for a meal.  They come ala carte or white rice and sides.  The staff was very friendly. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot! I love the hip decor. We even got to enjoy the sweet little patio out back on a cool night. We went as a family for our Friday night dinner...well it was actually our Friday night snack. :) We ordered some fries off of the appetizer menu...they were good. We also each ordered our own empanada. Everyone got something different and loved them so much that nobody wanted to give up a bite. I ordered the jalapeño popper with the salted ham. Oh my....little popper heaven...hubby wanted a bite...that wasn't happening!!! Next time we need to go back for more than just a snack. If you are looking to try something out of the ordinary check this place out...you'll be glad you did! P.S. The little sauce they give you when you sit down is out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews and really wanted to go. We went for dinner on a Wednesday night and were 2 of about 5 people in the whole place. We order the special and the rice and beans were cold. The empanada were good but somewhat small. Got a beer for a dollar off which was nice. Also got two dessert empanada which were the highlight of the meal hot and good. Food was ok but not sure I would drive the 20 minutes to come back."}
{"text":"I came to celebrate on my son's birthday. Saw on Yelp this place has good reviews so decided to try. I am very pleased to say everything that I tried was delicious. The Empanadas had great flavor. We got an order of French fries and it was full basket. I will definitely come here again. The only thing I will not recommend is getting the combo appetizer was to expensive for me for what we got but doesn't mean it wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Such a great place for lunch or dinner! Great empanadas and more! Try the arroz con pollo. They sometimes have soup in the winter time. Located a couple of blocs off the light rail stop in downtown Mesa. A must try if you're looking for good food, fun & a cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always start with the combo caribe: tostones (fried green plantain slices), yucca fries (with an awesome salt and herb garnish) and maduros (fried sweet plantain). The dish is served with crema and jalapeño cilantro ranch. For empanadas I usually go with an El Capitan, a Boricua and a Cubana. Those three are my favorite go tos, I especially love the green olive, golden raisin and egg in the El Capitan. If I have room dessert the fig, cheese and caramel is to die for. The sweetness of the figs and warm caramel is balanced out by the mild saltiness of melty cheese; throw some powder sugar on top and it is awesome. Plus there's always friendly and quick service which is a huge plus. They can get pretty busy and even then the food times aren't too bad. Plus they seem to always be playing Nacho Libre when I'm there, which I'm totally okay with."}
{"text":"Food and service was great!!!  I do recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, otherwise just anticipate that the good food will be worth the wait.  We were celebrating Father's Day and they allowed us to bring our own cake for dessert and they didn't try to rush us out so we really enjoyed our meal and celebration."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and it's always fantastic!  Great food - I haven't had an empanada yet that I didn't love, but the jalapeño potato is my favorite.  The caribe combo is fabulous as well, and the sangria is divine!"}
{"text":"Quiet little place with seating inside and out.  Good food, reasonable proportions.  Server was authentically friendly.  I'd go back when I'm in Mesa again."}
{"text":"The empanadas where sooo fresh and good. I had the cubano and the boricua.. I will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"Looooovvvveeeeee republica!! Such a cool little spot! We love Marco and his family, They do an amazing job of making everyone feel welcome and the food is delicious!!! We recommend them to everyone. Everything we had was just perfect and I may be a little obsessed with their cilantro jalapeño ranch! we have made republica empanada our definite go to spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite, go-to, lunch and dinner destinations. I was there when DD&D highlighted the restaurant. The food is innovative and delicious, and the service is great. It is close to MESA Arts and downtown Mesa, thus making it a perfect stop during a night out. Don't forget to try the desert empanadas."}
{"text":"Myself and my BFF (who is also vegan) drove 40 minutes to the east valley to get vegan empanadas and they did not disappoint! We also enjoyed the vegan platter with rice, beans, avocado, and cabbage. The restaurant is very warm and trendy with an ambiguous Latin American flair. They have items on the menu from many Latin American countries, so we had to do some digging to find out they are Costa Rican. Loved it! The Caribbean combo (fried yucca, fried sweet plantain and fried plantain - tostones) was delicious, but maybe a bit too greasy. Other than that, no complaints and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with great empanadas. They have a variety of savory and sweet offerings -- the sweet ones have an option to add ice cream and chocolate sauce. They appear to have several kid- and vegetarian-friendly offerings.  We have lived in Mesa for a long time, but this was our first time here. The location is a little off the beaten path, but we agreed that is was worth the trip. There isn't a lot of parking in their lot, but we went there when it wasn't very crowded and did not have any trouble.  As some others have reported, I think a normal person can probably eat 2-3 empanadas for a meal -- I'd suggest 2 and +1 for dessert, especially given the interesting dessert options. For the savory options, I also recommend using the salsa verde that they give you. It just seems like the right thing to do to brighten them up a little. Maybe not the Hawaiian one, but the others for sure. My kids had a bean and cheese and a cheeseburger empanada and enjoyed them. It was a nice touch that each different kind came in a little paper bag that was stamped with the type. They all look the same and that keeps things organized. If you order multiple of one type, you get one labeled bag containing several of that type.   I had the Pernil, which contained some roasted pork that was very good -- moist and tasty, especially with a little hit of the salsa verde. I also tried the Boricua, which had the same pork, but also rice and some kind of peas in it, I think. I liked this one the best. I had the platter, and found the rice to be cooked well, but a little boring (salsa verde to the rescue!). The fried plantains were perfectly cooked and very tasty.   For dessert, we split the Fig, Cheese and Caramel (Well, that one ended up being all mine since everyone else thought it sounded \"weird\") and the Ruiz's Pieces with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The Ruiz's Pieces is Nutella and peanut butter, and I have to admit it was the star of the show. The Fig, Cheese (Mozzarella) and Caramel was good, but I didn't think the flavors blended together as much as I would have liked: the ingredients were stacked/layered in the empanada with the caramel on the bottom, figs in the middle, and cheese on the top. It was definitely worth a try and interesting, especially if you like something a bit off the norm, but it was a little challenging to ensure that you got a bit of each filling in every bite.  Overall, I think everyone was happy and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved it here! Can't wait to come back. We had the arroz con pollo, the capitan empanada, the jalapeño popper empanada and the cubano. Wow! This food is delicious, the staff was very nice and this place is so cute, hipster-ish style decor."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, good atmosphere & nice owners. It's not well marked from the street but it's totally a downtown Mesa gem."}
{"text":"\"I've never eaten a hot pocket and then afterwards been: I'm glad I ate that\" -Jim G  All you need to know, is that these palatable pouches are anything but the frozen snacks made infamous by Mr Gaffigan.  J-WoW and I had been working up quite an appetite painting moonlit cherry blossoms, and wanted to pair our creative sides with a venue we'd never frequented... enter Yelp, which suggested this highly-ranked hideaway.  I was relieved to see a nearly packed parking area, as our previous potential eaterly was kinda ghost-town'ish.  J spotted a swanky hi-top, which suited me just fine... because the seats were 360 degree swivel!  Is there a better way to annoy that obnoxious group of strangers, sitting to the left of you, who ordered \"samples\" of Malbec and Shiraz?  Actually, I might try that sometime.  Oh, and it gets hella LOUD in there, son.  I looked like a fool with that waitress, yes, the one with the captivating red lipstain... after I referred to the cuisine as Cuban, or as I like to call it: Cuban-oh.  The fare is actually Costa Rican, or as I like to call it: Chican-oh.  Not knowing which of the appetizers to order, the waitress suggests the most expensive item, which I thought was a good choice.  After a little pleading, and emotional breakdown, J decided to trade halfs of her empenadas for halfs of mine.  That makes sense, until I realized I gave her both halves of my Pernil (slow roasted and specially seasoned pork).  I tricked her into trading one half back, because she tried to offload both halves of her Republica Chicken (chicken, fresh vegs and seasonings), onto me.  I saw how it burned her fingers after cutting it in half and picking it up.  As the scalding liquid ran down her fair hand, she screamed out      So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a lizzle     Got some cheesy drizzle, drippin' on my shizzle  All I could do was sit and stare.  I was captivated by my lil G, J.  I also ordered the Cubana (pernil, ham, mozzarella & dill pickle), which was fabulous (and J's favorite, even though she balked at first), and she also ordered the Jalapeño Popper (cream cheese, grilled seeded jalapeños & salted ham).  That oñe was my favorite, eveñ though I ñever order poppers añywhere, maiñly because I can ñever find the \"n\" key with the tilde, and that lack of autheñticity really cheapeñs the review.  \"There is the vegetarian hot pocket, for those of us who dont want to eat meat, but would still like diarrhea.\" -Jim G  Anywho... they also offer empenadas that dont contain meaty things.  Choose the Greek (sauteed spinach, feta, sun dried tomato, kalamata olive), the Cheeze (asiago & mozzarella blend), the Bean & Cheese (black beans & mozzarella) and Achite Potato (potato, annatto seed seasoning).  That's right, fool, count em... 4 vegetarian selections.  So, if yous latch key kids are sitting around the house, and got nothing in the freezer, grab some cash from your parents dresser and call a neighbor to swing you by Republica Empanada!  Hungry kids in the crib, ma Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot"}
{"text":"Found this place was open late (till 9) and thought I would try it. Very pleasant surprise when I walked in! Not a low-rent \"taco stand\" at all, but a hip, friendly local place with high-quality food and a lovely atmosphere. I met the owners who were so friendly and said I could sit on their patio with my dog anytime. The empanadas were DELICIOUS, very inexpensive (2 for $7.95) and had a green chili dipping sauce that is to die for. I will make this a regular local spot from now on!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a small restaurant to check out if you're in Mesa. The pork and chicken empanadas were amazing! The decor and atmosphere were really neat too. I'll definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"After my trip to Puerto Rico, a tiny voice in my mind has been calling for empanadas relentlessly. Unfortunately some of the places I've been to here in AZ have been selling glorified hot pockets masquerading as empanadas, so you can imagine my delight finding a place that specializes in them.  It's tucked away in central mesa, and if you're not looking for it you'll probably miss it. The atmophere is fun, urban and inviting. We were greeted and seated promptly.  I ordered the chicken empanada with the black bean salad- both were absolutely incredible, especially when dipped in the delicious green salsa everyone gets as they're seated. Warning: the salad is a LOT of food- you might want to split it with someone or get ready for some leftovers. We also ordered desert which was nothing short of incredible. Spring for the scoop of ice cream and whipped cream- worth every penny of the extra $3.  My only complaint was that the service was incredibly slow, especially considering we were one of only three or four other groups in the dining room. All said it took us about an hour to get our food. Also, we were shorted one empanada that barely made it out before our desert- and when it did it was the wrong one and we waited even longer for the correction. We were still charged for that one, which I was a little surprised by. I didn't want to make a fuss, so we paid and didn't say anything.   That said, the service was very friendly and attentive, so no worries there. We'll definitely be back as soon as that little voice in the back of my mind nagging for empanadas starts getting too lout to ignore."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Came in today for the lunch special, which came with a choice of 2 empanadas and all three of their sides. As a vegetarian, I was delighted that their rice and beans were both veggie! I went for the cheese and potato, the potato was my favorite, so good. The cheese was a giant mozzarella stick of deliciousness. My sister ordered a bean and cheese empanada, she's a veggie too, and TWICE empanadas came out with meat in them. The employees were very apologetic and we could tell it wasn't purposefully, as if a prep cook had accidentally mixed them up, but could have been bad if my sister had actually taken a bite. But as I said, they were nice about it, and I wouldn't hold it against them.   We also ordered three.... Yes three.... Dessert empanadas! Guava and cheese is where it's at.   I'm excited to come out on a Monday or Tuesday for their special! Beer and fried goodness. Nom!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried empanadas + soccer on the TV."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The fried sweet plantains (with fresh crema) are some of the best things I've ever tasted. Their fries are also very good, perfectly seasoned, and you get a ton with just one side order. Unfortunately I detest olives, and it seems that many of the otherwise tasty-sounding empanada choices contain the rotten things. But they do have the amazing jalapeno popper, which is my go-to.   I have two small gripes with this place... well, three, but I realize one is quite petty. I guess I'll start with that one... and that is that this place is in Mesa, but I live in Tempe! The drive over here is long and inconvenient, so I come here much less often than I'd like. I wish they would open a second location closer to me. I would go every week... no lie.  The other two have to do with price and service, sad to say. Everything seems just a tad overpriced... I get that it's a small local place, and they have bills (and employees!) to pay. And honestly, I don't mind shelling out the extra $$$ for the great food. But the check at the end of the meal here can come with a small shock. Since basically everything is ordered a la carte, and the empanadas themselves are quite small, the amounts add up quick. Perhaps they could offer more \"combo\" deals? I don't know... maybe I just indulge too much.   Lastly, the service... the wait staff all are nice, no problem there. But when you first enter you might as well be invisible, at least that's the experience I've had. Even when the place isn't very busy, when I come in I've had to wait several minutes to be helped. The entrance is around the corner from the kitchen, which is where the staff all hangs out, so they don't have a way to see people coming in. I wouldn't mind at all, except there is a sign at the front asking you to wait to be seated. I don't like to feel like I'm bothering people, but that's what happens when I inevitably walk to the kitchen and ask for a table. Perhaps they could implement a \"seat yourself\" policy, or add a bell to the door, or a camera for them to watch the door... something?  Despite the minor issues, I still really love this place, and would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience. The service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome, very cozy, dim, and creatively decorated. The food was....iight, I was hyping these empanadas up and they were okay, very crunchy shell with pretty runny insides for the bean and cheese empanada. The fries were actually better which is strange. Overall, I got a drink, 2 empanadas and fries for $15 which I guess is an okay price. They do have alcohol and sports on which makes it a great place to meet up with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is very average. I think we would only go here if were around Mesa, this is a not place that I would drive out of the way for.  PROS -Empanadas are pretty tasty. Great, crispy crust. We tried the jalapeno ham popper, pernil, cheeseburger and cubano. Our favorite empanada was the cubano one. The pickles were a nice touch.  -Empanada platter - where you can try a little of everything with rice and beans and plantains with a light yogurt sauce  CONS -My pernil torta didn't have a lot going on...it was a little boring and dry -Pretty dull atmosphere for Friday HH... -When arriving to get seated, it was pretty empty and one of the gentleman who was sitting saw us but kept doing whatever he was doing on the table (paperwork) and didn't say hi or seat us -Our server was very LOUD. The restaurant only had a few groups dining and it was pretty quiet but her voice was very booming... -HH is only for drinks and not on food  As you can see, more cons and pros for us."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived, but  we \"waited to be seated\" for about 5 minutes before one of us went to find someone to help us.     The food was great. Everyone at our table enjoyed what we ordered.  If we had ordered takeout, this would be a four star review. We ordered two different appetizers, four different empanadas and a dessert empanada. There weren't any real complaints about the food.        We did not enjoy that the entire process took over an hour. The other comments about waiting are no exaggeration. The empty restaurant had a line out the door by the time we left. There is no way the staff was prepared for this when they couldn't handle our table of four.   Total bill was $60 including tip.  2 appetizers 6 savory empanadas 3 dessert empanadas 1 Pepsi"}
{"text":"Totally recommend this place to anyone wanting to try something new, fresh, and authentic. I ordered the Empanada Platter, it came with the choice of two empanadas, white rice, black beans, cabbage, and plantains for $13.00, completely worth it. The food reminded me of my Mom's home cooking. It's a real small restaurant, but the atmosphere is great. Right next door you have the Mesa Urban Garden, cool place to check out after."}
{"text":"Food was good, especially the plantains! I couldn't get enough. The only complaint was the rice was hard as if it wasn't cooked long enough, but good flavors. I would go back and try other empanadas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The empanadas are delicious!  My favorite thing is the hearts of palm salad with chicken.  Their dressings and salsas are outstanding.  My favorite is the salsa-- I could pretty much eat that stuff by the gallon.  Don't miss the dessert empanadas either!  Everyone working here is super nice and friendly too.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you stumble on an unexpected treasure and you are blown away. Sometimes you find a restaurant that is so good that you just have to rave about it. Sometimes you find a restaurant whose proprietor is so earnest and sincere--and clearly gifted--that you just pray the restaurant takes off.  And sometimes you find a restaurant that makes you wish you were in place to invest and help it expand into other markets--like your home market.  Republica Empanada is all of those things.  It is tucked away just off the \"main drag\" of Mesa and it is well worth seeking out.  The atmosphere is unassuming but inviting.  But you're coming here for the food and the incredibly creative menu.  I had an amazing hearts of palm salad.  (How often am I going to describe a salad as amazing?)  It was fresh and crisp and well dressed and just perfectly delicious.  They must really care about their ingredients to be able to assemble such a fresh salad in Mesa, in January.  I also had their maduros.  They were perfect--and this is coming from a guy who used to live in Puerto Rico.  They were sweet and fried just to the point that they had that crunchy, caramel coating that you want one a plantain.  And their crema sauce was a perfect complement to the perfect plantains.  And of course I had an empanada.  The menu is so creative that I wish I wasn't watching my waistline because I wanted to try ALL of their empanadas.  Their menu is an homage to Latin cuisine with empanadas inspired by the cuisines of many (if not all) of the major Latin culinary capitals.  But I just got a cheese empanada.  (So I am going back tomorrow to try some others.)  But my \"just cheese\" empanada was heavenly.  The outer shell was crispy and flaky and, well, amazing.  And the cheese filling. . . the cheese filling? I wish I could have gone swimming in that cheese filling.  It was (have I said this word in this review already?) AMAZING!  Seriously, this place, if put on a beaten path (instead of off of one) would be printing it's own money.  (And don't get me wrong, the prices were imminently reasonable.)  If you live in this area (and by \"this area\" I mean the entire Southwest from San Diego to Denver) and you haven't been to Republica Empanada you are crazy.  If you live in other parts of the world, Republica Empanada merits a trip to Mesa.  (What the heck else merits a trip to Mesa?  (Apologies to residents of Mesa.))  I'm serious.  I'm considering cobbling together an offering to franchise this place in DC.  It's that good.  If you don't believe me, stop by there tomorrow and we can discuss it.  I'll be the guy with a giant plate of empanadas in front of me.  (Oh, and their eclectic beer list is amazing (there's that word again), too!)  Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place. I ordered a few different types of empanada, both savory and sweet. Only a couple of them were good...not great, just good.  Also, price is too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Greatest empanadas! Many Flavors to savor. And don't forget to visit the community garden next door :)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and very nice atmosphere. The hostess was friendly and made us feel welcomed. Everything we tried was really good especially the chile relleno and the jalapeño popper."}
{"text":"First time here. I loved it! Excellent food. Great atmosphere and friendly people. Absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"I started a new job so I work in the area, found this little gem of a place! I love empanadas and it's hard to find a place that does them right. I got the lunch special, came with a list of empanadas you could choose from, not all were listed, also served with black beans, white rice, and the cabbage salad. I picked the cheeseburger and chicken with mushrooms. I also got an extra empanada the jalapeño cream cheese potato. They were all amazing and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great good. Nice atmosphere. The owner himself came by and made sure we were taken care of. Try this place."}
{"text":"The empanadas are very good with plenty of choices.  Some of which were very unexpected.  The sauce they give you is excellent.  Very plain inside but very clean.  The service was very good.  My only complaint is that they are kind of expensive.  $13.00 for 2 empanadas, rice and some black beans seems kind of expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely deeelicious.  The food is awesome, however, the portion size for the price is not.  And, for this reason only, I will not return.  I was introduced to Republica Empanada at a recent conference.  The smorgasbord was to die for.  The taste stays with you.  I decided to pick up lunch and phoned in an order.  2 chicken empanadas, rice, beans and plantains.  $14.01.  Wow.  Not to worry, I needed to get back to work.  When I arrived at my job and opened the dish, I must say I was very disappointed.  It looked as though there were exactly 2 tablespoons of rice, a tablespoon of black beans and a tablespoon of salad. There were 3 small pieces of plantains. Wow.  The taste was delicious but not enough to send me back.  I believe in an equal exchange of energy/goods. Unfortunately, this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, like the art and the music. More importantly, these are the best empanadas I've ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about spending a summer in Argentina was trying to eat the most delicious food, as often as possible. Empanadas were a staple, and always mouthwatering. Republica Empanada nails it every single time- super authentic, every time I crave my Argentinian staple I have to come here! Mushroom and chicken is my favorite. Stop in and support, it's an awesome mom and pop place that's a must for lunch. Hoping they expand to Phoenix and Scottsdale soon!!"}
{"text":"I drove here from Scottsdale to meet my dad for lunch and we became instant fans. The place is small and quaint but the food is worth every bite. My dad ordered the Capitan and Boricua empanadas with rice and beans on the side. He was very happy with every bite. I ordered the Capitan and the Pernil. The Capitan empanada reminds me of empanadas my mom makes at home during the holidays. My favorite part of this meal was the Combo Caribe. WOW. Plantains and Tostones are my favorite and they were cooked just right. I highly recommend this place and learned that the Owners are from Costa Rica but wanted this place to have a South American/Caribbean flair. And YES it does.  My dad and I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Was nice to try something different for lunch but it was only okay. Tried the lunch special which came with two empanadas + rice + beans. Empanadas good but needs a dipping sauce. Overall a bit dry and the shell greasy. Also tried the pollo con arroz. That was disappointing. Compared to other PCAs I've had this was not it. This was prepared like chicken fried rice (but not as good tasting). Likely not to return as it was not memorable."}
{"text":"These are not ordinary. They are extremely good. My favorite was the pernil and the one with the fig. Didn't know fig could be so good. They accept reservations so you may want to make one if you plan to eat there."}
{"text":"We visited arizona couple weeks ago, I found this place on yelp. I'm glad we went, service was good, food delicious. Platanos fritos my favorite, well cooked. I'll definitely come back next time in town"}
{"text":"Unique Latin American food with some delicious choices. Great atmosphere and awesome staff! We ordered the black bean and cheese and the republica chicken empanadas with papas frites.  Just pure delicious! We were too full to do dessert but when we return we will get the peanut butter and Nutella with vanilla bean ice cream"}
{"text":"Came here during zapcon 4 in April my friend brought me here and I order the empenada with the pork I have to say it was very delicious also the Fry's they serve are good 5stars"}
{"text":"This restaurant was like a little slice of hipster downtown Phoenix in Mesa. The space is nicely decorated and has a 'cool' atmosphere. I went with a friend and we each got the dinner plate. Unfortunately, they were out of more than half of their variety of empanada... it was only around 6 pm.... Anyway, the empanadas I ended up getting were very good. Got the Cubana and the Boricua. The Cubana was very flavorful, and though I don't typically like ham, I really liked this. The Boricua was also good with pulled pork and a yellow rice.... it even has olives in it, which I don't like, but I liked this. The crust of their empanadas was thin and crispy....really delicious. The green sauce they provide is good, with nice heat, but is really strong with raw onion... I could taste it in my mouth all night. The dinner plate also came with rice and beans (which were both pretty standard, nothing special) and maduros which were very tasty. We shared dessert, a fig and cheese with ice cream...this was tasty, but I didn't think the ice cream added too much...for the extra 3$, just get a second empanada. I would definitely come back here if I were in the neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Chose this place as I liked their menu as I was excited to get fresh empanadas. I tried their pork and their cheese. The pork was a bit disappointing in regard to flavor.  The presentation of the plate was great. But overall, beans included, the food was average.  My server was friendly, but failed to follow up with refills even though it was just myself and one other person in the place."}
{"text":"A must eat! Loved the empanadas. My fav: Achiote potato and I loved the rice. Eating my chilled mango slice from my iced tea was the best part. :P Make sure to try the sweet empanadas. Great service!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I can't remember our servers name, but he was off the day Guy Fieri was in if that helps? He's awesome. Recommended the jalapeño potato popper and the watermelon spiked Agua Fresca. He knows his stuff. Loved that the staff was really cohesive and working together for every table, not just \"their\" table.  Enjoyed a romantic walk around the community garden after. Will return."}
{"text":"Really neat little place, great service and fun ambiance. The menu has a lot of options and a large variety! My one complaint is that the meats just tasted reheated and really lacked flavor. We tried the chicken and pernil and they were okay, but just kind of dry and flavorless. The plantain and traditional plate was really fun but overall just lacked the flavor punch I anticipated. Loved the jalapeño, black bean and cream cheese empeñada, definitely the best item we had!"}
{"text":"2nd or 3rd time here, also have ordered to go a couple of times, never an issue in the past, and loved the various empanadas we've tried. AWFUL experience tonight however. Arrived at 5:30, just ahead of a mob of people. Seated and ordered fairly quickly. Watched as the entry area filled and nobody was taking any names or greeting the new arrivals. Watched one large group walk out after being ignored for 10-15 minutes, and at least one smaller group leave as well. Our appetizer finally came out about 40 minutes after ordering, with a quick apology and promise to remove it from the bill for being so late. Remember, we got in BEFORE the rush, and it still took an eternity. Our dinners were literally 15 seconds behind the appetizer. I ordered a platter, \"Arroz Colombiana\", which oddly isn't on the online menu. It was loaded with peas and olives, 2 ingredients that aren't listed among the many on the menu. I despise peas and would have ordered something else had they been disclosed. It was also quite bland. No one checked on us after our food was delivered, nor did the waitress notice as she left the check that I had a massive pile of peas on a side plate that I'd dug out of my dish. There was another throng of people waiting to be greeted/seated as we left, and again there was no one at the podium to help, and frustration was visible. I don't know what was so wrong tonight - short-staffed, or a general inability to handle high volume - but they dropped the ball on several levels here.  Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"This is a small cafe located just behind Benedictine University in Mesa.  It is hard to locate.  I initially drove right by it, and I was looking for it.  I was pleasantly surprised though.  The empanadas are very good.  I had the Lunch special, and I chose the Greek and the Boricua for the two empanada choices.  They were good.    I see that they do serve certain alcoholic drinks (beer).  While I do not drink alcohol, what they do serve is fitting for it.  Perhaps with it being in downtown, this may be a good late night hangout....perhaps just missing the mojitos and related, but then again I do not drink.  I also do not know if they want to have a full bar given they are so close to the university.    This is a good place for either lunch or a snack....maybe late night."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my husband and three of our friends. Empanadas are delicious and tasty. We enjoyed the Pernil, El Capitan, and a Chicken with vegetables. Service was very good. We willl go back."}
{"text":"I heart this place not just because it may be the only restaurant in metro Phoenix devoted to empanadas with dough that is so crispy and soft on the inside, but the owner is warm, friendly and just a really good guy. This place is only a block over from downtown Mesa's Main Street yet it feels so removed. It also at first glance appears not to be in the best neighborhood. The owner said there are quite a few halfway houses in the area. Still, instead of being intimidated by it, he offers a helping hand if needed. The place isn't that big but it's still an inviting space. That's in large part due to the repurposed wooden tables and the one long communal table. There are a couple of TVs but it doesn't feel like a sports bar.   As for the food, I had a special--arroz Colombiano--which came with shrimp, sausage and slices of avocado and red bell pepper on a huge pile of rice. It was kind of oily but still tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken and beef empanadas. Two is plenty for one meal. But by far, my favorite was the dessert one--fig, mozzarella and dulce de leche. That one is worth miles and miles of exercise. Definitely do yourself a favor and get that if nothing else.  The owner was flattered when I said I came all the way from central Phoenix, like it's super far. But he appreciated it because he knows there are a slew of choices closer to my home. I reassured him that I would be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place. We traveled pretty far to get there . The staff is super friendly. Unfortunately they kept getting my orders wrong. They also took a long time to get us our fiid with a fairly emoty restaurant. We ordered boriqua, Capitan, bean and cheese, fig and cheese, nutella and banana, guava and cheese. Plus a sopa verde. The sopa Verde is great so flavorful and perfect for a hang over. Bean and cheese was great as well all the others lacked flavor. I don't think I will make the journey again."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the ambience quirky, and the service is stellar! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The empanadas are delicious!! One of the best lunches I've had in a long time.  We had the Cheeseburger and the Buffalo Chicken empanadas.  The green sauce they give you is fantastic, I'm not quite sure what's in them besides a heavy helping of what surely must be magic, but I could drink that stuff up!!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the ruff exposing this seemingly rough side of town to a delectable Latin flavor."}
{"text":"Although April 8th is National Empanada Day, July 18th seemed like an appropriate day to try out these bad boys!  The Spanish word for bread is \"pan\" and \"empanar\" is a verb that means \"to bread.\"  Emapanada is the past-participle, \"breaded.\"  Think of it as a pasty, a Hot Pocket, or a turnover.  These delicious pastries can be sweet or savory.  Since I had the best dining companion with me, I decided to go empanada-crazy [no joke, I tried six yesterday]!    We shared a Combo Caribe which is starch-infused goodness and we each got an Empanada Platter which comes with two savory empanadas and is served with rice, beans, cabbage salad, and maduros & crema Mexicana.  I got the Jalapeno Poppers and Republica Chicken.  Those suckers are tiny bombs of super hot meat and sauces.  It's amazing how I didn't whip my Republica Chicken across the room like a grenade when some of the sauce dribbled onto my hand.  It was an intense moment of pain... lots and lots of pain.  I got The King and Guava & Cheese empanadas to-go for dessert.  Mr. Dubs consumed them all like a champ and his official statement is that The King was the best because peanut butter and bananas... obviously!  All in all, delicious empanadas!  It's a small cozy place with a great atmosphere . The bullet holes in the skinny window off to the side is... charming.  I'd return for the empanadas hands down but I'd probably pass on the appetizers.  And a friendly reminder:  Don't be dumb like me and try to eat the empanadas right away or you'll suffer burning your tongue!"}
{"text":"awesome empanadas and the owner is a great guy, they just cooked and catered the City's restaurant event downtown and they were a hit!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Gluten free options, delicious sangria and in downtown Mesa! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting shop that I was surprised to find in Mesa. Someone mentioned it has a cool, hipster vibe, and I think that's an accurate way to describe it. There's plenty of parking around the building, and there's menus near the door to look over while you wait in line to order. Food is brought to your table.  I had the lunch plate special, where you choose two empanadas from several options. It comes with sides - black beans, rice, and a cabbage salad. There's several beers and canned soda to choose from, too.  I had a black bean and cheese empanada and the buffalo chicken empanada. I thought the black bean and cheese was pretty good - nice ratio, without one element overpowering the other. It was flavored pretty simply but it was good. The buffalo chicken had a lot of bleu cheese, so beware if you aren't a fan. It was pretty good, but it tasted like bottled buffalo sauce from the grocery store. It was good, but not great. Chicken was moist, which is a definite plus.  The side of black beans were also very plain. The rice was dry. The cabbage had a tiny hint of sweet dressing but it seemed like a weird side to the empanadas. A friend had the boricua which he did not like. He said the filling was dry and lacked flavor. We split a fig, cheese, and caramel dessert empanada which I liked a lot. It was probably the highlight of the meal.  For Mesa, this is nice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If you're in the area, stop in. It's a nice, different concept that's pretty well executed."}
{"text":"Just watched this place on food network  with DDD guy fiery..looks prerty legit..will check it out"}
{"text":"Even if we came in late, almost closing time, they still welcomingly accommodated us. The place is small, but very nice and cozy. Cool ambiance!   The PB&J empanada was great."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Service was below par. It's always a shame when you go to a place that takes wonderful care of your taste buds, but lacks in service. This place could easily be 5 stars with a simple fix of taking care of their customers.   We really didn't know who our server was. We started with one. Got picked up by a different server because he noticed our first server ditched us. Then we got ditched by that server so I adopted the hostess to help us with the check. Which by the way took 35 minutes.   The empanadas were delicious all the way until the last bite. I will go back to this place even though the wait time for service is long.   Hopefully next time they at least pretend that I'm a paying customer eating in their restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  I have had a chance to have their catered meals while attending Jazz A to Z at the Mesa Arts Center ( that was the hook).  I have been there numerous time since, just good quality and good flavors.  My Wife and I just went on Sunday, It was her first time.  She got the chicken, I got the chicken and mushroom, and we split the combo caribe'...and two local beers.  Just the right amount of food.  We will always return.   Kepp up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The variety of empanadas is great. Dessert selection of empanadas is yummy. Good drink selection... Bottled drinks, beer too I think? Atmosphere is great; excellent spot for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Randomly discovered this quaint restaurant today when doing some work in Mesa. Delicious hardly describes it. Their Monday-Friday lunch special is well priced and has an excellent variety of options. I had the jalapeño bean popper empanada as well as the Borecua empanada along with rice, beans and cabbage salad. The green sauce that accompanied it was fabulous. My lunch companions enjoyed their meals as well. We all come from different cultural backgrounds and noted how the food made us feel like we were eating the dishes we know and love. I will definitely go back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap food. The staff are really nice, hardworking people."}
{"text":"Republica Emanada is sooooo yummy. The Pernil, the Cubana, the Achiote Potato- they're all delicious. And don't get me started on the Fig Cheese and Caramel. I'm still dreaming about it's gooey deliciousness.  The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the appetizer combo with plantains and yucca fries. It was okay, but not particularly flavorful.   Definitely check this place out, but skip the appetizer and order an extra dessert!"}
{"text":"Such a great idea for a restaurant! They have traditional fillings for empanadas, and some other fun ones that are tasty. The dessert empanadas are DELICIOUS! The inside is set up nicely, and there is an option to eat outside."}
{"text":"Meh... $3-$3.25 fancy under filled hot pockets.  Didn't feel it was a good value and at bill time got forgotten about for about ten minutes. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pro's: It's close to where I live and the food is OK in my opinion. Con's: It's a loud bar atmosphere. Asked for no ice in my soda and I got unwanted ice. A bit expensive for people on a tight budget. This place is perfect for people that like outdoor dining and a loud bar environment."}
{"text":"What should you eat? The Cubano empanada with a side of tostones. And get a little extra of that jalapeño ranch - you'll want it.  When should you go? After 6 PM on Mondays and Tuesdays, apparently. They do a $20 \"flight night\" deal: 4 flights of beer, 4 empanadas, all for less than a tank of gas. And all their beer is localish - there's some Portland and Mexican brews, but there's selections from Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, and even Mesa.   My only regret: Other than not coming during that 4-for-20 nonsense extravaganza, I wish I'd had room to try one of the sweet empanadas. After two empanadas and sharing the caribé platter (which, delicious), I couldn't eat another bite. But oh man, did I want to."}
{"text":"Awsome food!!! I could eat one of each little empanadas.  They have multiple flavor options.  The services is not bad.  The place is chic.  And the location is not in a plaza or at a main streets but it in a good location."}
{"text":"I have to say.... YUM!  My first time here and so much more to try!  So it's a quaint little mom and pop store. Clean and cute. There is both off the street parking and a parking lot. We were seated immediately at lunch hour on the July 4th. The waitress was attentive and did her job well.  Now for the food! I ordered Boricua which is rice, peas and pork , my daughter, not so adventurous had ham and cheese, we split an order of their homemade seasoned  fries that had a yummy green sauce. I also ordered the fig empanada. If I only go back there again  for one thing it would be for that fig empanada! I really liked the Boricua the pork was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The food is so good here! I loved all the savory empanadas we had here. The dessert ones were a little strange though but the pumpkin one was still pretty good despite it all"}
{"text":"Great, trendy place to get your Carribean comfort food. Really good  for vegetarians and meat eaters. I had Achioto empanada and my husband  had the lunch special  which came with your choice  of 2 empanadas, rice and beans for $7.95. We shared the appetizers  combo caribe which although was over priced was very good. Good, fast service and establishment was clean and upbeat."}
{"text":"The empanadas may be small but they are full of flavor and filling. Both savory and sweet styles. Good beer selection.  The restaurant is small so expect a wait on busy days."}
{"text":"This is fantastic. The empanada were amazing. My favorite was the cubano with pork ham cheese and pickles but the pbj and plantain and cremA were also amazing. The plantains were out of this world and the cassava with jalapeno ranch was also delightful. It was busy put not packed which was weird considering the high quality combined with reasonable prices. Beer selection was also superb. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"You can burn your tongue at this place!  If like me you are incapable of waiting until the empanadas are cool enough to eat.  Who has that kid of patience?  They were amazing.  I could have eaten 10 by myself, but that's a bit embarrassing.   Next time I want to try the sweet ones. The only drawback was that it was really slow and I get that they make them from scratch, but it just seemed extremely slow for the amount of clients at the time. The place is in a tiny little place hidden in downtown Mesa (behind Center for the Arts), so I'm sure they get plenty of clients from events down there."}
