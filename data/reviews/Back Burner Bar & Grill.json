{"text":"This is such a swell place...I can't wait for the new mustard. The ketchup was phenomenal I can't believe how delish it was and what ever the girl/man said an how there was liquids in the ketchup better shut the heck up like T.P. SHUT UP. I love this place I can't believe that they have almost CLEAR soda//sprite. The service of the place was quite amazing, they were so nice to me and didn't judge me for how much I drank(#wasted)."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Food is always so good & never disappoints. You can taste the homemade love right in each bite. The happy hour specials are awesome! (Almost 1/2 off all bar drinks and I believe there is an appetizer special as well) The bartenders are always friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"A great local bar/restaurant. Been welcomed every time, by attentive and friendly staff. The atmosphere is smoke-free, which is a welcome change in Coraopolis, the menu isn't huge, but food is well done.  Daily food specials, and a rocking happy hour from 5-7pm & all day Sunday!  And most important for the Pittsburgh sports fan: Just the right amount of TVs to keep an eye on the game.   A totally new business! I was skeptical on my first visit that it was just a rebrand of the former owners, I was pleasantly surprised to find new ownership, new menu, and updated interior. Check out the Back Burner you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Placed a to-go order for a group of friends.  When I got there I was told they were packing it up.  15 minutes later it's finally ready.  I honestly don't think it was being packed up w/ that length of time.  Upon opening everything up, one of the sandwiches didn't even have the tissue paper in the bottom.  Then there's 3 giant cups of something red.  We find out its ketchup.  A bit much considering there were only 3 sandwiches that came w/ fries, and I guess the fish sandwich.  Not even sure it was Heinz because it seemed a bit runny.    Onto the food:  Fresh cut fries - good. Probably would have even been better had we ate at the restaurant. Fish sandwich - good, flakey; maybe cooked just a bit much since alot of the batter was coming off and some parts a bit dark. Pierogies - very tasty, seemed liked they may have been deep fried for a minute but it wasn't advertised on the menu as such. Also seemed home made. Wings - Ok. Even though you could taste the buffalo sauce, it didn't even look like there was any sauce on them at all. Hamburger w/ a Fried Egg - Terrible, frozen burger, burnt and extremely dry.  The egg was the only good thing about it. Reuben - Worst reuben ever.  This is the sandwich that had no paper in it.  First, overloaded w/ dressing leaking all over the container.  The corned beef was sliced way too thick and was tough.  And who serves a reuben on a hoagie bun ????  It should be served on marble rye!!!!  I thought I saw somewhere that the owner went to culinary school.  We were all expecting so much more.  Like maybe a fresh burger!  I doubt any of us will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and friendly local place. I stopped in on a quiet Sunday evening. I had wings and the lemon pepper wings were really good, flavorful and tasty. Staff are friendly and cool. Smoke free environment and a special shout out for clean bathrooms."}
