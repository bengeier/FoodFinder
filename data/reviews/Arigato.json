{"text":"We've been there mostly every Saturday lunch and we always order Bibimbop and teriyaki chicken bento.. Comfort food and good price !"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken teriyaki bento box.  $9.73 plus tax; total $11.00

- Portion size was good. 5/5
- Chicken teriyaki had too much sauce and was just acceptable. 3/5
- Soy sauce was salty. I didn't ask if they had low sodium soy sauce (which I prefer).
- Tempura, California roll and and sushi was decent. 3/5

Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. I absolutely love this place!

This sushi place is located in an Asian mall food court. While it may look like a fast food place, this is restaurant quality Japanese food for a fraction of the price.

If you don't mind eating in a crowded food court, I highly recommend going to this place for good sushi.

I went here tonight for dinner and picked up a bento for only $11.50. It came with sushi, sashimi, California rolls, and tempura. It also included a bowl of rice  and soup. A sit down Japanese restaurant would have charged me almost $20 for this meal. Tonight, I paid almost half that.

The sushi tasted great. The rice was really fresh and tasted delicious. The tempura was crispy and flavorful (although this time the tempura was just slightly overcooked, but still tasted great!).

This place is really a great hidden gem in Mississauga. Great sushi at an unbelievable price - what more could I ask for?

One quick note, this place is cash only. Still, five star restaurant hands down."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you want come decent sushi at a low price. Terrible service however... I ordered a bento box and clearly stated which one. When they gave be the wrong order and I told them what I actually order they basically told me tough luck."}
{"text":"Despite going to Dixie Park Mall often, this was my first time rating from Arigato. And damn, I was impressed!

I got a dolsot bibimbap that cost only $8 (outside prices range from $10 to $12) and it came in an authentic stone bowl. The entire dish was sizzling, and there was this perfect layer of crispy rice lining the bottom, formed from the oil caked on the rice. The toppings were unseasoned white radish, pickled carrots, julienned cucumbers, bean sprouts, bulgogi beef, and a fried egg. There was a generous amount of toppings! The entire order also came with a side of miso soup. My main complaint is that the rice was quite soggy in the centre, and so I left most of that untouched (felt like porridge).

My sister ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup) which came also in a hot stone bowl. There were at least two pieces of pork on chunky cuts of bone, and so much tender meaty goodness.

Just a tip: don't come here and order what we did in the summer. The food court isn't adequately air conditioned, and by the end of our meal, we were sweating bullets. I swear my thighs left an imprint on the seat...

Another tip: be sure to get your change! I didn't get any change for our order, but unfortunately didn't realize until after the fact."}
{"text":"TAKOYAKI BALLS!!! I don't know why I love them so much, but I've had other takoyaki and it just isn't as good as it was here!

It was so yummy with the tempura bits which add a nice texture to the dish.  I wish I had more! Lol 

I'll be sure to try out other dishes here like the pork bone soup and bulgogi, but for now...I'm always going to come for the takoyaki :)

The gentleman at the cash was fast, efficient and polite!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I want some good japanese food that we take on the go. Its not amazing but it hits the spot quite well for me.

I tend to get the same thing when I like something and I always go for their pork sizzling set and sometimes I get something from their bento menu. Its been consistent and am happy with it always being like that.

The staff are fast and efficient..and yes, I recommend you trying them out!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in a little mall on Dixie, but oh my the sushi is great! 
The service is always friendly and the prices are also amazing. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyed this food court place in the ghetto looking strip mall. The person taking orders isn't too friendly and almost always sits in the back so you have to call them to come take your order. I had the takoyaki and bulgogi hotpot. The takoyaki was sauced up and had 1-2 pieces of octopus inside each ball. The hotpot was bubbling when it arrived and was a sweet broth that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"For what it is, re:  a stall in a somewhat dingy Asian food court in Dixie Park, it's pretty decent.  Warning:  Tables aren't the cleanest and sometimes floor is sticky,

Arigato serves Korean/Japanese food, including 15 different types of bento boxes, various rolls, and the Korean staples like bibimbap, bulgolgi, kalbi, pork bone soup for dine-in OR takeout.  Stall is relatively busy which is a good sign!

Food was served shortly after ordering - within 10mins.  And PBS was quite good, better than in some restaurants.

Average cost was like $10pp.  It's a no nonsense type place!"}
{"text":"Meal for 2 under $20 

All the dishes here are reasonably priced. Very cheap. 

The bulgogi shabu shabu was only $6.99. The soup was delicious and comparable to owls. The order came with some glass noodles inside and a bowl of rice on the side. It was pretty filling. 

The spicy sizzling pork was $8.99. It came with a bowl of rice and soup. Portion of this was a little small the pork was really soft maybe a little too soft. But the food was decent. 

Overall good for the price. Good place to grab something cheap and quick to eat !"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, decent Korean foods, and price is cheap!  Will definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a dingy food court in a small asian mall but don't let appearances fool you because the food is actually pretty good! At least the takoyaki is. They were large, filling and very delicious. They didn't skimp on the condiments/toppings at all despite the low price."}
{"text":"Forewarning that this place is located in a small dingy mall / food court. However as dead as the rest of this \"mall\" may seem, the food court is always poppin'! Mostly Chinese food at this food court, this place is packed on both weekdays and weekends. I'd suggest ordering the food to go if you live nearby as the seating at this place can get cramped and a bit dirty. However, onto the main point of this review - the food at Arigato is both amazing and cheap! It's located at the far back corner of the food court.

There are so many options when you come here, their entire wall is filled with a photo menu! Mixture of bento boxes, sushi rolls, and your typical Korean fare like bibimbap, pork bone soup, etc. A full meal can cost you between $6-$15 which is easy on the wallet.

Came here numerous times since work is just down the street and I usually get their bibimbap served in the hot stone bowl or Bento #11 (chicken katsu on a bed of Japanese rice, dumplings, California roll, and salad and miso soup all for $10 incl tax!!!). Taste wise is very good and also on par with your sit down restaurants for a fraction of the price! (I'd shy away from their teriyaki chicken/beef though - a bit dry for my taste) but everything else on the menu is worth trying! Portion size is also perfect, not too much and enough to fill you up!

They also do sushi boats and platters btw! You can call ahead and place an order. Just remember that they're closed on Monday (and sometimes Sunday if I recall correctly) and take cash only!

Undoubtedly, arigato for existing, Arigato! So glad I found this hidden gem in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Small food court style resto in right cornor of food court. Friendly staff.  Serves most Japanese dishes. Great variety of sushi platters. 

Sashimi don buri tastes really great. Salmon , white fish with fresh crisp veges.  
Squid tako yaki tastes ok.  7/10.  

Good presentation and playing."}
