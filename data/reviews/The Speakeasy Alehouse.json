{"text":"The beer selection is wonderful, and they also have a full bar.  The food is definitely better than your average bar food (the pork chop w/sweet potatoes and green beans?  Delicious!  Deep fried burger?  Wow.), although the service is a little slow.  They also have good choices for the goods.  We always have a great time here, see lots of neighborhood folks, and the evening entertainment has always been great, especially Jay Mathey!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, I really, really want to like this place.  But, every time I go back, I feel like I'm a glutton for punishment.  

Food:  You could call the menu eclectic; I would say they're trying too hard.  It's your basic neighborhood pub, one would expect basic, but tasty pub food.  On my visits I've had soggy empanadas, very dry pulled pork sliders, runny, tasteless fondue, and yet again dry mahi-mahi (I mean who puts a descriptor \"burnt cashew cream\" on their menu).   Every burger I've had was charred beyond recognition.  All I'm asking for is want a simple meal I can enjoy with a beer. 

Entertainment:  The live music is inexplicably loud.  Don't even think about trying to carry on a conversation.  

Bar:  And if you're going solely for the beer; also, just meh.  Pale Ales and IPAs are the most popular craft beer style in American.  But, unless you're looking for high gravity, don't expect to find them on tap here.   

I had so much hope for this place.  I think that's why it's such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We were passing through, and a little hesitant after seeing there were only two not-so-good ratings.  We werent starving, so felt up to the challenge.  The assortment and selection of beer was spot-on.  We ordered Carolina Shiners Queso-cream cheese, rotel, sausage.  It was delicious.  And we split the Hop Along Cassidy Burger-great taste with cream cheese, hot pepper jelly, bacon, and shredded lettuce. Best burger we have had  in a very long time.  The bartender, Jakob, was helpful and we enjoyed great conversation with him.  This is a place that would be worth going out of your way for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a burger and beer in Concord. I would prefer a larger selection of beer, but then again, I can only drink so many after scarfing down the beer battered Dillinger burger. I've also been to a wedding reception that was catered by these guys, upstairs above their restaurant. The food and service were amazing, and the room was a beautiful old movie theater they restored."}
{"text":"Sometimes service can be slow.. (The kitchen is actually upstairs) Wait staff changes quite a bit.. But the food is really good!! And they have live music on the weekends! Lots of IPAs and different kinds of beers too!
Dixie chicken is the best fried chicken I have had and as a born n bread Cabarrus countian I have had my fair share. Two big fried boneless chicken breasts with honey and red pepper flakes in the crust and two sides. Sweet and spicy! Mmmmmm 

Best spinach dip in the world!! Has little pieces of ham which really adds to the flavor!
Hop along burger is so good w red pepper relish and cream cheese!!
Mahi mahi w burnt cashew sauce mmm 
I have heard the root beer basted empanadas are really good too!
Love the twists they put on regular dishes w a little different sauce or ingredient like mashed potatoes with blue cheese crumbles! Makes all the difference 
If you have been here and had something you didn't like be patient w them n try again! I'm sure you will find a new favorite dish at this locally owned hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Speak easy twice, the first time i was a little disappointing but thought it had potential.
I took the family there last night. It was around 8pm on a Sunday night, not a lot of folks there. the waitress was attentive,  the food took longer than I would have liked to arrive but considering the time and traffic I figured it was OK. The waitress was on the spot with drinks but slacked off once the food arrived. which is a no no for me.
The food was fantastic, way better than the last visit and overall we were happy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised. The prices were very reasonable and the food was delicious. I was told a new menu was in the works and should be available in a few weeks.

Sandwiches ranged from $7-$10 and main courses were $10-$15. The menu isn't huge, but there is something for everyone. There was a full page list of beers on tap, along with where it was brewed, alcohol content, and price. I had a summer ale for $3 that was very good.

I don't know why this place doesn't have very many reviews, it had a good size crowd when I arrived around 6:00. The desert list looked so good but I was too full, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Hole in the wall pub style atmosphere. Relatively small for the number of people dining at tables. I arrived at around 7 on a Saturday, and left shortly after the music started. The band was good, but given the small venue you may want to steer clear if you don't like it loud. 

Food: I had the \"Groucho Marx ($9.50),\" which is an open-face bacon-wrapped veal meatlof sandwich with mashed potatoes and a side of green beans. It was excellent. 

Beer: There was a pretty good beer selection including lots of bottles and 6 or 7 drafts. I had Duck-Rabbit Milk Stout (bottle, $3), New Holland Cabin Fever (draft pint, $6) and Terrapin Moo-Hoo (draft pint, $6)

For what I had this was a great value at $26.17+tip. One small note is that the specials board was misleading. It read \"Stouts & Porters $3\" and.the Moo-Hoo, a chocolate milk stout, was $6. I didn't mind because it is an excellent beer. The bartender explained (after I got the tab) that the special was bottles only."}
{"text":"A small but surprisingly hip and lively saloon-style pub hidden in a sleepy, corner of downtown Concord that features a creative menu and a beer selection  to kill for. Any restaurant that will beer batter and deep fry a burger (The Dillinger) and add root beer to its pulled pork empanadas (The Houdini)  will always be OK in my book, if for the superior effort only. But it's not just the burgers and appetizers that are unique-- the desserts take the experience to a whole other level. I dare you to find another restaurant that will serve creme brulee cheesecake with Bananas Foster bathed in a bourbon creme anglaise for six bucks -- so good it could be illegal."}
{"text":"Lets see... Where do I start? 

Service is horrible but typical for most Concord establishments. Prepare to be ignored while the waitstaff / bartenders carry on with their conversations. I actually saw the bartender notice that my beer had a tiny amount left.....and kept walking. 

The food is just OK. Apparently, it acceptable to be out of certain beers on a Saturday evening and also out of Cheddar. ?????

My friend ordered a hamburger after being tempted with the addition of Candied Bacon.  Now, if you're like the few of us that picture a nice crispy piece of bacon dappled with dark brown sugar crumbles that will make a very audible \"snap\" when broken..... You're wrong. What she received were several pieces of bacon with  a limp noodle consistency that tasted as if they poured a simple syrup over it. Oh, and she ordered the burger medium well and it was very Well Done. 
    The food isn't horrible and has potential just like the rest of the bar but whoever is managing this place needs to hand over the keys. 
    I couldn't imagine going to a bar/restaurant similar to The Speakeasy in Charlotte and need to ask for another beer or get told that they're out of anything. It was early on a Saturday night people,.....come on. 
   Oh, I forgot to mention, we were 2 of probably 8 people total. So, no excuses of \"being too busy\" can be used on this one."}
{"text":"Stopped in here over the holidays. It was packed but that was to be expected as lots of people were reuniting with home friends. They have some music in the front which was nice, different than just having the top 40 radio blaring. It was extremely crowded so we didn't stay long but probably will go back next time I am in town. The food look like typical bar, but tasty none the less. Seems like the best option for after midnight in downtown Concord."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat in Concord!
They usually have a live band or some type of live music on weekends. 
Small menu.. But food is cooked to order. 
Huge selection of strange beers from around the world. I'm a tea person, their sweet tea is as good as any others. 
Please, do not come here if you're in a hurry!! 
The Speakeasy is a laid back, fun place to be. 
And loud!! The place can be over crowded at times. With the people and the music, it's not the perfect place to take your Grandmother. 
Great menu. 
Great atmosphere. 
Great food!!"}
{"text":"There aren't a whole bunch of places to eat in Downtown Concord, let alone on a Sunday. The advantage of the Alehouse is their menu - this has been mentioned before. It's adventurous in many places, let alone in this tiny pub in Concord, of all places.

Unfortunately, when you try and actually eat off said menu, you would think a place that says they open at 12pm on Sunday, they would actually open then. Since we're talking a small restaurant, and not a large, multinational joint, I can even cut them a bit of slack - but were they open by 12:30? 1? 2? Nope. And we're not talking just web site here, because everyone knows that few people keep up with their site.

The recording on their phone said the same thing (when it answered), and even the neighbors said they should have been open, as well as people stopping by hoping to come in. Now it's possible that they had an issue with something serious, and I hope that's not the case - but even if so, there should have been someone there, because most places are run by more than a single person. And said recording mentioned something about being closed for the July 4th weekend, so methinks they don't update that very often either.

A poster in the window also mentioned a concert coming up later this week - so it seems more likely that they just didn't want to open early, perhaps because the Panthers game on Sunday wasn't until later in the after. Incidentally, we went down the street to another place that was open, and they still hadn't opened by well after 3pm. No idea."}
{"text":"Almost left because it was really noisy (football games) and dark and I had my infant son with me- decided to brave it and am SO GLAD I DID!!! I had the spinach dip as an appetizer (it was very rich like it was made with a lot of cream cheese), and the Cary Grant (steak, blue cheese mashed potatoes, onion marmalade and I substituted asparagus for the carrots) it was divine!!! Would definitely return, maybe without the baby next time, can't wait to try other menu items!

They were out of one of the beers I wanted to try, no biggie- and several menu items had been taken off the menu, but instead of having new ones printed- they just covered the deleted item with electrical tape, I'm nosy I had to peel the tape back and read what I was missing. 

Our service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is getting a crappy rating even though I really wanted to like it. Seriously. I may not even give them a second chance, which is rare for me to withhold. I was *that* annoyed.

How bad, you ask?
How do I count the ways? 

I arrived late, but they were stil serving. Server took forEVER to respond, and then told me the kitchen was \"closed\". (Can a bar close a kitchen completely while serving alcohol???)

 Upon further inquiry, he conceded that they still had sandwiches, maybe fries, but no grill. Cool; I can deal with that. So we make a quick beer selection (more on that later) and move to the food. Server tries to steer me into a chicken salad sandwich- but, I abhor, absolutely ABHOR mayonnaise... so notsomuch. I respond with his/kitchen's choice of either of 2 coldcut sandwiches (because I am basically easy), and since I ABHOR mayo.... no mayo on it, k?

I get my sandwich with potato chip crumbs (yuck) and it is absolutely slathered with a white creamy substance, which, silly me, I mistake for the dread aforementioned MAYO. Server comes back with the response, \"That is honey mustard. Not mayo.\" 

Hello? Any server with a brain might, just might, consider asking the patron who has emphasized her dislike of dressings on her sandwich if they *want* the honey mustard, or, GODS forbid, put it on the side just in case. But, it's late, I have a beer and need food to offset the alcohol. So I choke down an otherwise perfectly good sandwich ruined (for me at least) by the addition of the quart of damned honey mustard- and begin to form a poor opinion of the place.

 Server comes back as I finish the sandwich to see if it was OK...like there were options at that point? Riiiight.

Oh yes, about the beer. I love IPAs. See one on the menu, asked what the alcohol content was since I am needing to eat, and I don't like high gravity beers in general. Server tried to inform me that IPA styles *only* come in high-gravity offerings. I responded that I knew of quite a few very good ones that were anything *but* high alcohol content...at which point he amended his statement to say *available here*. So I switched to another, unsatisfactory choice based on alcohol content. And, after the rigamarole about the beer and sandwich, I don't get asked if I want a second beer (since my glass was EMPTY), but have the check dumped in front of me. Guess they wanted to go home. So much for the traditional \"last call\". And, so much for my discretionary income. 

Taco Mac is a few minutes further away; has a full menu til 2 AM, and 100 beers on tap, plus bottles... AND people who actuallly know what they are serving. I'm thinking I won't be back to the Alehouse, even though I would dearly prefer to support a local business. Just too many negatives in the one visit to overcome.  Sad, actually."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this place. I like the food here and have only been dissatisfied with it once. Considering how many times we've been to this restaurant, that says a lot! They do have an eclectic but not very big menu, along with live music on the weekends. When there are musicians, it's extremely loud all over the place...very difficult to hear. They are also extremely busy on the weekends, so be prepared to wait at least half an hour to get a table on a Friday or Saturday night. Their service is consistently dependable and friendly. It's not for everyone, but check it out if you want something a little different than the typical Concord fare!"}
