{"text":"Fellow yelper Kirellos S. and I shared a pepperoni pizza, mild chicken wings and garlic knots.  -The garlic knots are better than any other garlic knots that I've ever had. -The chicken wings were good, because they were freshly cooked and served steaming hot. According to other yelp reviews, the ranch is homemade. -The pizza was a little bit thicker than I had hoped for, but that's not really saying much coming from a person who enjoys thin crust pizzas. The sauce was really good.  I definitely enjoyed my stay there, because Kirellos elbowed his water, spilling it everywhere. The owner came and mopped it up, reassuring him that it was okay, since she knows he did not do it on purpose. Then another guy came to mop a second time and said, \"Who needs the sippy cup?\" We were relieved that they used comedic relief to make us feel better about the accident. The best part was that they really did replace his water with a sippy cup! Ok, it was really a to-go cup, but it was just as funny. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Had a WONDERFUL baked lasagne for lunch here a couple of weeks ago.  It was out of this world, crazy good!  I can't wait to have a chance to go back to try their Napolitana-style pizzas."}
{"text":"Unreal they have always been rude and cheap, but its so bad now we went there TONIGHT, and ordred a veggi pizza the service was unsettling the waitress was pushy and in a rush. I asked to substitute two toppings her SON ran out of eggplnt and instead of the waitress notifying us he SNEAKED artichokes on there...  The pizza was so F...... undercooked and the chticken was like a ROCK and the amounts of toppings and cheese could not feed a MOUSE WTF...  I explanied they were rude and they told us F... YOU GET THE F... OUT AND NEVER COME BACK...."}
{"text":"My husband and I (kids too) love Enzo's pizza so much that we have started making it a Friday night ritual.  We always get their pizza special of a large cheese pizza, wings, and garlic knots for $20!!  What a deal and it is so delicious.     Did I mention how amazing the garlic knots are????     Their pizza is definately one of the best that we have tasted since moving here to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been coming here since I was a kid with my family and I can honestly say that it's one of my favorite spots here in Henderson. The food is awesome and the staff is so welcoming. Tonight I had the Pizza Margherita which was so simple yet flavorful I loved it and I will definitely be ordering this again...My dad had the linguine with clams in red sauce, which he was nice enough to share and let me tell you it was sooo good. Hands down best meal I have had in a while!!! Also I can't forget to mention the GARLIC KNOTS omg they are to die for!!! So if your in the area please make a stop at Enzo's and try it you won't be sorry :)"}
{"text":"Purchased garlic knots hoping to bite into some fresh, warm, soft bread. Unfortunately, this was not the place to buy them from. They were ready in under 2 minutes! The bread was slightly warm, hard and had a very mild taste of garlic. Not fresh at all. I'm disappointed and I will not come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after checking if any pizza places nearby offered delivery. Noticed the lunch special (two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $6, or add three garlic knots for $.50) and decided we'd just dine in -- it's close enough to Sunset and Green Valley to be a good fit.  Food was good. Slices are huge; the two slices I got were probably well over a quarter of a large pizza. Crust was good, not burnt but not too greasy. Garlic knots were passable, if crunchy. Might've been left out too long.  Drinks are fairly small and refills aren't free ($0.50), but they'll last you over lunch. Atmosphere was nice and fairly quiet at 1:30 PM on a Monday.  Overall, decent experience and worth going back to. Cheap and good."}
{"text":"I ordered food from Enzo's to go. I should have known better when I showed up and there was no one in the place except the guy behind the counter who didn't seem that excited to be helping me with my to-go order.   I got fettuccini alfredo which comes with garlic knots and a house salad. Yikes. When my order is given to me it is in a box that used to house their canned alfredo sauce. Uh...at least pretend my meal didn't come out of a jar, would ya? The garlic knots were bad, at best. They were garlicky...which is desireable, but that's where it ends. They were hard and clearly not made from scratch. (By the way, bread and alfredo sauce are very easy-to-make, minimal ingredient items.) The salad was...just, wow. Awful iceberg lettuce that was browning. Tomatoes that were dried out. Carrots that were shriveled around the edges and clearly had seen better days. The dressing was obviously from a tub as well, not surprisingly at this point.  All in all, this place should only be open to Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. I've heard the pizza is ok, but I'm scared to find out what jars their sauce comes from and what bags their pre-shredded cheese comes out of."}
{"text":"So I ordered a large 16 inch Pizza Napolitana for delivery with 3 items, and asked for mushrooms, tomatoes and anchovies(only on half the pizza) the guy charged me $5 for delivery because I lived like 5 miles away instead of the 3 miles radius that they charge 2$ for which I didnt mind paying although it didnt seem fair and when I got my pizza i wish I had returned it. My total was $24 something and for a 16inch 3 topping pizza it was a total rip off.  The anchovies I asked for only on half the pizza ended up being 3 tiny pieces on 4 big slices of pizza, thats not even one anchovie for a slice!!!  Also, mushrooms and tomatoes are not the most expensive veggies in the world and it looked as if they sliced just one mushroom and one tomatoe for a large pizza that clearly looked that these guys were trying to make money and not a quality pizza. It might be a different story if you are in the restaurant for a sit down where they cant do it to your face but for delivery they totally try to get away with being as cheap as possible and $24 dollars for a pizza shouldnt be a cheap pizza with barely anything on it, bottom line, i paid $24 dollars for a cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the neighborhood. I called last night to order. The lady was rude as fuck, but ok I'll let it go everyone has a bad day right? Order was on time (35 mins) like she said. Guy delivers, he was nice nothin bad to say about him, but the food? It was bad I can't even sugar coat it. I'm guessing they use frozen spinach on ur pizza which is gross I can't stand soggy pizza and that's exactly what it was. Soggy & sloppy! its pretty disappointing since I would like to be a regular somewhere, definitely won't be back. You can't have bad service and bad food, you got to Pick a struggle! Ughhhh what a waste.  I don't like to do a bad review but the lady's attitude and the crappy food I just had to say something"}
{"text":"This pizza/Italian restaurant is a Green Valley classic. It is right across the street from the GV Library, and has fed my starving tummy many a times between study sessions. It is by far the absolute 100% best pizza in this area. And I guarantee Enzo himself will be inside, making pizzas and lasagnas and calzone and chicken fingers, when you get there. The pizzas are pretty big, so be careful when ordering. But its okay if you overdo it, that just means awesome leftovers. It's always hot inside the dining area, so I suggest picking it up and eating it elsewhere. All that magic in the back where they cook must produce a lot of heat. That, or there is no ac unit. I don't know. I know when its 110 degrees out and I am about to eat a piping hot pie, I don't want to be a sweaty Betty. Anyway...if you are from Green Valley and have never had Enzo's, I never want to talk to you again. If you are new to the area, do yourself the favor and check it out. You will not be disappointed. Get some garlic knots too, they add that much more \"mmm\" factor to Enzos Pizza. I give it five stars and I mean it."}
{"text":"The pizza is a 5 star all the way!!! Being from NY it's hard to find good quality NY pizza in the valley. Enzos does it right. The garlic knots were a little hard for my taste. Wish I could give a 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Since we recently moved to a nearby neighborhood I Wish it was Good!  It sadly was awful....the garlic bread was stale, hard bread with unrecognizable tastes.  It certainly was not garlic.  The pizza was hardly NY Style Pizza!  (Lived in NY for over 50 years.) Undercooked crust, very little sauce, and perhaps slices of melted cheese?  Texture, Taste, Temperature, Presentation all poor!    Everything was served on paper plates...the flimsy, limp ones!  The atmosphere was cold with no smiles or pleasantries.  Too indifferent to our presence."}
{"text":"Very rude and horrible customer service! Last I checked a restaurant was part of the service industry - but at this place you get anything but! Walked in, was not greeted or directed by anyone. After waiting about 5-8 minutes, we decided it must be seat yourself and sat down in a nearby open booth. A man came by and dropped off menus with not so much as a grunt. When the waitress approached I told her it was our first time at the restaurant and we weren't sure if it was seat yourself or not. She looked at me and replied curtly \" Most restaurants aren't seat yourself just so ya know\" and walked away. My husband and I looked at each other in shock at what we heard. We then proceeded to get up and leave. We will never return. I don't care how good the food is, the way we were treated is just not worth it. I would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Me and my sister wanted to try something new with her kids. We got to the restaurant and the woman behind the counter had an attitude. I am sorry that we are bothering you by eating at your restaurant, lady. She was nice to the other people sitting in the dining area so I guess it was just us she didn't like the look of.  Anyway, about the food. First the water tasted like tap water. I ordered mild chicken fingers and they were plain, my sister got hot and they were what a typical mild tastes like. My niece asked for a side of sauce for our plain fingers and the lady was a snot, again. The fries were good. The worst was my nephew's spaghetti, he is eight and eats everything and he said it wasn't good, that it tasted funny. My sister tried it and said the sauce was gross, she said it tasted like ketchup. The meatball tasted like the meatballs in spaghetti-o's. And to top it all off both my sister and my nephew were sick this morning. The only thing they ate in common was that spaghetti which only had a few bites taken out of it. Grossly overpriced for mediocrity.  I don't ask for much, friendliness, affordability and food that doesn't taste disgusting. I got none of that. Shame since I like little holes in the wall joints. They can't really afford to be this bad."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby needed to go to the Dollar Tree for some stuff and we decided to try a little pizzeria. It was Enzo's and Enzo himself was there. He is such a funny guy. Great sense of humor. The pizza was delicious. I don't mind paying a bit more for a slice of pie when it truly tastes homemade. Definitely will return and highly recommend stopping by for a slice of pie and great customer service."}
{"text":"This is the Pizza place i have searched for all my life, The new york style pizza just melts in your mouth. The perfect crust has been created at enzo's. you must go here period.."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good, havent tried anything else yet, however their service is just as bad as most new yorkers, they charge 50CENTS for refills! bunch of cheapskates! only on the strip you can get away with that!"}
{"text":"So...my daughter and I wanted to try a local \"hole in the wall\" so to speak on 5/2/16. I don't like to speak prolly about a restaurant but this place was horrible. The Baked Ziti tasted like it was frozen. The sauce tasted as though it had freezer burn. The Stromboli was the same way. It was obvious that it was microwaved and not baked like it should have been. Service was marginal at best. To top things off though....I left a tip on the table and a couple of days later when I checked my cleared transactions from my bank...I discovered that they tacked on an ADDITIONAL $7.00 to my charge. Why? Who knows.  I will NEVER go there again. Poor food and they are dishonest with credit charges. If I could give \"ZERO STARS\" I would."}
{"text":"Went here twice over a 6 month time frame. Each time I ordered the lunch special slice of pie, salad and a drink for $7.95  and I was sorely disappointed. The slice of pizza was days old, without any flavor, lacking any ply-ability and truly tasted like a reheated piece of wood. No - wood may have had a better taste!"}
{"text":"It's so great that good food isn't far away from me.  The pizza is delicious and watch out for their sausage... it's incrEDIBLE.  I'm one of those people that doesn't eat their pizza crusts but trust me, if the pizza is from Enzo's I'll try to eat it all.  We did have some miscommunication the first time we went here: they ended up giving us a huge ass thick crust pizza when we asked for the thin crust.  Our lesson was learned and we decided to use the correct verbiage of Nepolitana for the thin crust pizza next time we went there and there was no problem.  The man up front (not sure what his name is) is a really nice guy and I just want to give hime a big hug when I see him.    As I told my boyfriend \"THEY WILL KNOW MY NAME!!!\""}
{"text":"good food, but bunch of cheapskates, they charge 50 cents for a refill! only on the strip you can get away with that! The son is rude, he doesn't bring my slices to me, he leaves it on the counter for me to pick it up when im dining in and just talks to his mommy, instead of improving the business, theyve been in business for 20 years but theres a reason the place is never sold out! A pizza oven should never be empty!"}
{"text":"We came across Enzo's after stopping at  Trader Joes. It was 8:55pm, but the owner was more than welcoming. I loved the feel of the place, very mom & pop-like. The wife ordered 2 cheese pizza slices, a soda, & a salad for about $9. I had two pepperoni slices and a house beer for $7. It was all freshly made- we were satisfied with the prices, quality of food, and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Enzo's has some pro's and con's. Let's start:  Con's: The service is TERRIBLE the staff is rude, and extremely slow.  Pro's: They are CHEAP! $20 for:              1) Large cheese pizza- the crust was AMAZING! Sauce was straight out of a can and the middle was a little too greasy for me but the crust made up for it.  2) 12 wings- We ordered them Hot (spicy) which they weren't but they still had a good flavor and were cooked well.  3) 12 garlic knots- Again these were the same AMAZING dough with a light garlicy salty goodness about them.  The meal was large enough for four and we took most of it home.  We also ordered the Cappuccino Truffle which was great. (Cappuccino ice cream covered in a dark chocolate shell.)   Overall I would go back..... But order take out :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Love their pizza, chicken fingers, and garlic knots deal. Actually the only thing I've gotten, besides the cannolis(yum):)"}
{"text":"Best pizza outside of New York! My Husband and I went to Enzo's for lunch yesterday. I had the cheese pizza and garlic knots and my Husband had the chicken parm sandwich. Delicious! Live across town but will travel there for great food!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast I can say New York style pizza is king. That being said all the pizza chains in Las Vegas cannot compare to their east coast counterparts. I found Enzo's several years ago and I can tell you if you like Sicilian style pizza Enzo's is by far the best in town. Their garlic knots are flat out ridiculous.  Getting a Sicilian pie and an order of garlic knots reminds me of home. I can't comment on any other items on the menu because I order the same thing every time I eat there. When you find your love there is no reason to stray. The staff is friendly. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I just ate at this place never been here before, I walked in and the man asked me what I wanted he seemed to be in a very bad mood.  I said well I was going to eat. So then I sit down order a salad and a side off pasta. Awful the salad was not ever cut properly had a little oil on it then the pasta was watered down with canned sauce no flavor what so ever I took one bite. When I said I did not like the food he still charged me $10 never will I recommend this place no customer service and to charge me for two bites of food how terrible they must need every dime just to try and stay open. Just saying. Never visit again never"}
{"text":"The food is good. However I ordered a medium pizza half bacon and 10 wings. The price was almost $28. There weren't even carrots with my wings. Not impressed for the price.  They also charged me a delivery fee, I live directly across the street."}
{"text":"Dear Enzo's, Do you really do enough volume of business in your little pizza shop that you can afford to be curt and discourteous with customers? How many customers have not returned simply because you refuse to offer a pleasant atmosphere on the phone and in your shop?   You claim to be NY style pizza. I lived in NYC for 6 years so my hopes were high. The pizza was OK, but even pizza shops in NYC were 10 times more friendly than you. You get a 0 for service and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine pizza, but not the stellar gastronomic experience that I was expecting from the other reviews.  I ordered a large veggie with 1/2 chicken added.   The veggies were numerous and plentiful (including cooked eggplant and lots of spinach... yum!) However,  The chicken was barely there. Only two pieces of the pie had any at all. I also felt that they were stingy with the mozzarella.   The selection and amount of veggies made the overall pizza pretty sloppy, and  the crust soggy. Definitely a knife-and-fork  affair. Perhaps this is just an issue with this particular specialty pie.  I'll try another one, but for my money, Metro Pizza, and Giovanni's on Eastern still rate higher."}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here unexpectedly one Sunday night, when we needed dinner, were already hungry, but also needed to grab some things at Trader Joe's. We caught them before they were closing - about a 1/2 hour before, don't worry - we aren't the jerks that walk in asking for a pizza 5 min. before closing! :D   They were very friendly and helpful as we ordered here for the first time. Takeout was easy, and the thick crust pizza that we ordered was delicious. (See photo if you want your mouth to water!)  I am only giving four stars because I really felt like, \"Yay! I'm a fan!\" but I want to be able to sit down and have that \"AMEN\" moment in order to give five. I can at least tell you it's definitely a great place to go for take out."}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best. They were nice and the service was decently fast, but certainly not worth the money. My small dish of ravioli was $13.  Certainly not worth the money."}
{"text":"We came in at 845, the owner told us to \"hurry up & make up our minds\" to my boyfriend and I. Also, he couldn't order the stuffed pasta because it takes too long to make. We changed our order...I got the chicken philly, which wasn't pleasing at all. It was all bread! They up charged for fries and it came with barely any. We usually go to Napoli's (which is similar) but wanted to try something different...sad to say we weren't pleased at all. The owner was also acting like a grumpy old man."}
{"text":"My Wife and I visited Enzo's on three separate occasions. Their pizza is OK, a bit overpriced and nothing special. We visited a second and third time because our options are limited here in Las Vegas/Henderson. Our third visit, last night, was the last straw. We ordered the Enzo's special, which included a large cheese pizza, 10 wings, and an order of garlic knots. The pizza and knots were mediocre at best. However, this is not the sole reason for us reverting back to Alexander's pizza (Located on Broadbent BLVD), which is the better choice of the two. Our order of wings became fictional after we realized that there were no wings. Instead, we received 10 dried-up mini chicken legs.  We determined that dried-up mini chicken legs just might be Enzo's trademark. Our order of wings came as such on all three occasions. Done."}
{"text":"Pasta ranges from $10-$14.  It comes with 4 garlic knots and a salad.  I was expecting more \"authentic Italian taste\".  I ordered plain spaghetti. It was ok.  And also ordered pasta with steak strips.  That was the expensive dish.  The sauce and pasta were not the best for the price but the thin steak strips were ok.  Not what I expected for top of the line pasta. Bummer."}
{"text":"went to trader joes and spotted this place and glad I did. Food was great, very reasonable prices, the atmosphere was chill and everything was clean, the owner is super nice and very pleasant to chat with. I recommend this place and will come back again."}
{"text":"Video link at bottom review. Worst service I have ever had. I am 22 years old I don't want to be treated with any disrespect because I wear a hat. I have lived here for 5 days and new to the area they will really short with me had an a problem because I did not understand there menu and had to ask for a menu. No help at all. So on top if the bad service the pizza was horrible. I called Enzo back (the owner) to say I was unhappy with the pizza and service and her swore and yelled on the phone. So I went in to talk to him and he swore at me in person telling me to f****n leave. Only wanted to pay me back for half the price. Worst place I have been to here in the area. I have a video of him yelling at me.  He refused to give me his name and wanted to hear nothing I had to say.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuq5w_GpZTo&feature=youtu.be please check it out."}
{"text":"I am so happy right now.  Walked in between lunch and dinner to a clean and quiet restaurant and was greeted by a smiling man who was extremely pleasant.  Ordered the white pizza and added chicken and  mushrooms.  And a slice of cheese cake.  Right now I am sitting at home, eating the best pizza I've ever tasted, and planning my next visit.  If you have not been to Enzo's pizza I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stop by here for the lunch special when I need to go to the post office next door. I love the pizza and garlic knots! When I order a whole pizza, it's a white pizza! It's perfect cheese and garlic amount, best in town!"}
{"text":"Must have been good at some point but not when I was there.  You could hear the 2 employees complain the whole time.  They should have been watching the food instead.  Garlic knots were hard as weapons and the pizza crust was burnt cardboard.  Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with my boys. We got fresh cheese pizza and it was so yummy.  We were the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a very unappetizing place to be. As soon as we walked in, it had a very unpleasant smell. The bread was tasteless. No flavor and felt like it came out of the freezer. Ohh, I can't forget about the salad. It was like throwing pieces of lettuce on the plate. The lettuce was falling off the table. I asked for bleu cheese dressing... IT WAS JUST MAYO WITH PEPPER SEASONING.  No bleu cheese crumbs. I felt uncomfortable eating there. Never again will I come to this place. Sorry for those regular customers who come there often."}
{"text":"The only reason why I have decided to a 1 star is only because this one old lady that work there I believe she is the manager of Enzo's pizza cussed me out just because I only ask for some paper plates.  This is real serious because I felt degraded, unnoticed, grossed, and angry of how she disrespect me only because she find's my time is a waste.  I only came there just for a pick up and As she is complaining about a company making allot charges she decided to blow up on me as soon as I asked about paper plates.  If she is reviewing this right now I hope you are because this is poor customer service.  NO ONE SHOULD EVER COME TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE!!!  It is horrible and pitiful because I got called out by dirty filthy words.  And possibly cussing out and degrading other customers too!!  I have check all this company reviews and majority of them are horrible and sad to see how They are not satisfied. Please if you all don't want any trouble stay away from this place because it was the most horrible feeling I got in my life from a restaurant.    All the other people are friendly I love them!!! But this lady who work there or probably the manager because she got all right to act the way she is;  giving poor customer service.  Yeah it's really bad.  If you decide to go just be prepared for the worst when you get your food prepared and ready.."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Had an eggplant parm sandwich which the bread was so hard i couldn't bite or cut through it. Discussed this with the waiter who became instantly defensive and acted like a jack ass. Had the nerve to throw the bill on the table. They can take their stinkin New York attitude and shove it. Save your money."}
{"text":"I was here years ago was treated like crap. I came back and nothing has changed F this place. I'll never be back"}
{"text":"Super rude and food is mediocre. I like to support small businesses, but this place sucks.  Woman on the phone was super rude and nasty to deal with. Won't return."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and couldn't decide on dinner. We were returning movies at Blockbuster that shares a parking lot with Enzo's. While in blockbuster my husband checked the reviews and we decided to risk it.   We entered the establishment behind a group of 4. We were greeted immediately and offered a table. The decor of the place leaves some to be desired. The booths and chairs are all obviously old and outdated. The glass covered tables could have used some updating. Our table was dirty and sticky. Yuck.   We read reviews about the service being rude. I like to think I have high standards for service (I am usually disappointed), but I could not agree that the staff was rude. The server (guessing he's the son of this mom & pop establishment) was polite, just not overly talkative. I wouldn't consider that rude at all. He could use some brushing up on phone etiquette, but in person service was good. He responded to us well, was patient when we were indecisive and we didn't have to wait on or ask for anything as he tried to anticipate our needs. He was prompt in his work and although he was checking his personal cell phone frequently, it did not impede his work (just looked unprofessional).   My husband ordered the chicken Parmesan, his go-to meal when trying a new place. The chicken was \"super tender\" and \"it was delicious\".   I ordered the Alfredo, with chicken. After some though, I guess that the chicken was a full breast portion but for some reason it looked like a VERY small amount of chicken for the extra $3. With chicken, the meal was $13 and at that price, I expected more flavor. There was not much sauce, leaving the pasta somewhat dry and the lack of flavor did not help the situation. I managed to eat about half of the dish, so I can't complain about portion size based on the price. I took some leftover, but to be honest, didn't eat it. There was no taste. Disappointing.   I give 3/5 stars based on the dirty table and lack of flavor for my meal. I hesitate to give it less than that as the portions were great, the service was good and my husband (who is PICKY) loved his meal. I would go back and try other dishes, or even the same dish to see if maybe it was just an off day.   Overall, I was not disappointed to the point of no return. I hope to be able to return and update my review, to be honest."}
{"text":"Did not really care for the pizza. Got a pepperoni and what I thought would be black olives instead they used kalmata olives. Disappointing when you expect one thing and get another."}
{"text":"Oh how we LOVE Enzo's! The delicious homemade blue cheese dressing. The garlic knots are so delightful, warm, soft inside, just so good. We had meatballs and angel hair pasta. So, so very good! After nearly 30 years in business, Enzo still knows that a clean restaurant, good food, and great service will always be appreciated."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices!  Small restaurant that could be easily overlooked, make a trip to trader joes and then stop next door st Enzo's!"}
{"text":"This is a fixture in Green Valley as it has been there for at least the 18 years I've lived here.  There's a few things you should know about this place.I can't say much about the whole menu as I pretty much stick to the pizza when I order take-out.    What to expect:  -Enzo might be cranky that day, don't hold it against him it's hot back there.  -The pizza is awesome and the crust is the BEST.  -If you like toppings, please know that they will NEVER be evenly distributed around the pie.  Get used to it, it's been that way forever.  -The sausage is a crumbly shredded consistency which I love the texture it gives and the flavor is terrific.  -Enzo's son will park his Audi in the best spot right out front and after a while you'll stop being pissed about it.  -Don't even think about asking Enzo to sell you a ball of dough like most places would for $2, he has a psychotic fear that you'll take it to a lab and have it analyzed and open up a place next door and run him out of business.  Bottom line...the pizza is great! Great flavor and I even find myself daydreaming about a large peperoni and sausage right after eating at the deli next door."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza on my way home from work so I just stopped into the first pizza joint I saw.  This appears to be a family-run joint.  The NY style pizza was excellent as was the lasagna!  My only complaint is that the pricepoint leaves no value for the consumer."}
{"text":"I had been several times at the business center where Enzo's is located and I was curious about that little place next to my local Trader Joe's. Finally one of those weekends of pizza cravings, I decided to give this restaurant a try, and I was glad I did.  I tried the napolitana pizza, which on the menu says is the thin crust. I was worried about it being so thin I'd feel like eating a toast; but it was perfect! Not too thin, not to thick.  The tomato sauce tastes definitely homemade. Something strange ( I had read about in a previous review) is that the toppings are not evenly put in the whole pizza, but somewhat accumulated towards the center. The flavor was exquisite, so this uneven toppings distribution didn't bother me at all.   There's not doubt I will come back for more delicious food at this place, however this time I will not have a pick up pizza, but I will eat there. The dining area looks cozy, and family owned, and places like this, are precisely my favorite to eat. Enzo's pizzeria in Henderson, you will be my savior for my next pizza cravings :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed when we first got there and when the food came, I was kinda meh.  The server at first was lackadaisical and just wasn't a pleasant person.  Not sure if she heard our complaints but she turned a complete 180 after and she was a chipper lady.  The food came and at first I wasn't thrilled.  I thought it lacked taste but as I ate the food, it tasted better and I was pretty impressed.  Their lunch specials come with \"gelato,\" a drink, and a side salad, and all for $10!  I have to warn you, their gelato isn't gelato.  It tasted like old ice cream. I was seriously disappointed.  For a mom & pop place, this place was a good find.  Just needs to provide better service and don't say their ice cream is gelato."}
{"text":"I work in an small office, we order lunch everyday yesterday we decided pizza. The lunch specials were not any kind of deal so we decided to go with two large pizzas for 8 of us here in the office. The food was overpriced it was a good size, but the taste wasn't really up to par with the pricing."}
{"text":"I ordered a ravioli dinner and it was good.  But my husband and daughter got the chicken alfredo and I think the just put sweet corn sauce on the noodles and no alfredo sauce . They couldn't even eat it. $50 delivery down the toilet . Will never order from here again ."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite. The owner was rude to take out order. We ordered ice tea and it tasted horrible. We asked to get something else and the owner was rude about us not liking the ice tea. The chicken fingers were way too salty and the meatball Parmesan needed more sauce. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, fresh tasting,  good service. Great mom & pop place just like the east coast."}
{"text":"This was once our very favorite pizza on the planet.  Been eating here since they opened.  The current state of this pizza is: cheese-less, gooy-less, with also massive skimping on the sausage. Before it was ok that the owner was rude because you knew you were getting the best pizza ever. Now the person who answered the phone was beyond cold, sharp and the pizza arrives tasteless and Italian-less. Beyond bummed and disappointed.  \"Momma, you should call them before you post this,\" \"I did 2 times.\""}
{"text":"Best NY pizza!  2 slices, knots and drink.   The owner is great.   Best lunch specials.  It's been here forever,  and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Enzo's since it opened.  Food is great!  Service is fast, food is freshly cooked and everything is just plain good.  We have gotten to know Enzo & Margaret and their son over the years and we thoroughly enjoy going there.  You feel like family, the grown kids and grandkids love going there for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I recommend the special it was very good! Pizza, wings and knots where delicious. The service is great. I can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat at Enzo's all the time and while I can see why some people think the service is hit-or-miss, I for one am willing to look past the rare occurances of less than stellar service we have received in the past because the food is just that good! I always joke that they must put crack in the pizza because it's so addicting. Some people may find the pizza too greasy but I would'nt change a thing about it. If you go there definitely try the garlic knots, they're the stuff dreams are made of. I've even gone there just to get an order of knots to go!"}
{"text":"i lurveee enzo's. the crust is thin, chewy with a slight crunch. the sauce is not too salty and just tomatoey right and the cheese is always hot and plentiful. the garlic knots are the best here. i've been a patron of enzo's for almost 15 years (went there at least three times a week for lunch during high school!) and even though I don't get to LV that frequently I always stop at enzo's for pizza, garlic knots and ranch."}
{"text":"After ordering from Enzos for the last eight years as my kids love the pizza I bit my tongue many times when I called and was treated rude time after time tonight when Enzos wouldn't answer the phone I tried a new pizza place call Jessie's they deliver anywhere in Henderson and it was nice to call and have somebody appreciate your business instead of somebody act as though your a problem on their busy schedule sorry Enzo at some point you can't continue to be rude to customers that have been loyal to your company for many many many years. I know you probably don't care but look at your reviews when people are saying that you're rude over and over and over again you may want to take a step back and let your customers know that you appreciate them!!  Good pizza bad customer service maybe it's a New York thing I don't know. We order pizza three times a month at least so there's 36 $50 tickets that you lost maybe a  $1800  are your customers not that important to younot that important to you.   Might be time to hang it up or we look at how you take care of your customers!!"}
{"text":"Dear Enzo's,  I love you.  You, your food, and your humble decor and atmosphere.  I feel like we've gotten to know each other quite well.  After all, I have been eating your food for as long as I can remember (at least 20 years).  I'm very fond of the memories I have with you.  However, Enzo's, if you are rude to me or my husband, one more time, I will probably never come back ever again.  I understand that there may be an east meets west kind of out-of-syncness with our communication, I get it.  I really do.  But you complained about us, in front of us, because we didn't give you the coupon at the exact time when you preferred it.  Never mind that I have been coming here for 20 years or that we simply didn't know.  You don't make eye contact, you don't say hello or thank you.  When I ask a question, the answer is half-assed and un-helpful.    Enzo's, your food is terrific.  The value is terrific.  I hold sentimental value in your establishment.  But your service of late, steals every bit of pleasure from our meals.  It tarnishes the memories.  It makes the food taste bitter.    I really don't want to break up with you Enzo's, but in case you didn't know there are a lot of new players in the locally-owned delicious Italian food genre.  Some might even have better food than yours.  If you were nice to me, I wouldn't even think about it.  But as of right now, they are looking like my next choice."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been going to Trader Joe's in the same vicinity as Enzo's and I never discovered this little Gem of Italian Food! My son & I were looking for Italian food for Valentine's day and all the places we drove by were jam packed. He had to drop off movies at Block Buster (same vicinity) I waited in the car, I smelled garlic in the air Lo and Behold there I saw Enzo's!  So we took a chance, good thing because all I can say, is that every thing we ordered was DELICIOUS! Finally I found a delicious hole in the wall Italian restaurant, with EXCELLENT & Friendly service! Can't wait to go back this week, this time for pizza! I'm Happily Hooked!"}
{"text":"The place has really decent and fairly authentic Italian pizza. It's a little pricey for pizza, but well worth trying. The only shortcoming was using canned jalapeños, instead of freshly sliced ones. The service could use some smiles too, but it's really not much higher scale than a diner so you're going to get diner-class servers. I'd recommend getting your pizza to go."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Carly G.   As if the food isn't bad enough, the service is even worse.  I had to meet a few friends here so I decided to stay but regretted it.  We all did.  Pizza is awful, spaghetti is right out of a can, or it tasted like it.   Skip this one.  There are great Italian restaurants with far better food and service."}
{"text":"its'a pizza pie! my boyfriend's family introduced me to this mom and pop little shop a few months ago. being from nyc they thought i'd appreciate the good pies and the service. we decided to go here for dinner tonight and i was surprised enzo's wife remembered me from back in october. (it's a family joint. the family that makes pizza pies together, stays together!) walking in you get the east coast accents and the funny (maybe harsh to some people who can't take a joke) service. being my 2nd time there tonight i felt like i was part of the family. i love them! the pies are good. good enough that i lick my fingers clean of the sauce. i can't decide if my favorite is the pepperoni or the sausage. thin crust and very fold worthy. very fresh and you can taste it. the garlic knots are tasty and leave my breath warding off vampires for the rest of the day. i love the ranch they use to dip my pizza crust (and sometimes chicken fingers) in. very thick and rich. my boyfriends 1 year old niece happens to love to suck it off the chicken tenders so that has to be a good sign? good enough for me to dip! the chicken fingers always come out extra hot and juicy, white on the inside. beware for a few minutes for your mouths sake. my boyfriend and i also like to share the ravioli in meat sauce. i'm telling you that sauce is addicting. i am a fan of enzo's. the service is fun and reminds me of some of my favorite pizza joints back in nyc. i love their humor and their pizza pies. it is becoming one of my go-to places when i need that nyc crack pizza fix. i get those a lot. good thing with the deals we have leftovers for a few days."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and knots! We came here for a quick bite before our movie and they brought the food out immediately. Great little pizza place to get a quick bite and a beer for a solid price!"}
{"text":"Quaint little Italian place, cute decor. The hubs & I were on a mission to find calzones and we lucked out! I'd seen this place while shopping in the area as we just moved here. We stopped in on a whim and we will definitely be back. I got the spinach calzone which had fresh spinach, not mushy frozen spinach like you typically get. They were delicious! The beer was pricey, however. I appreciated that they will deliver as well. Not sure what their bad reviews are about. We loved it!"}
{"text":"So many folks have already raved about Enzo and his hole-in-the-wall establishment, I doubt that I have all that much to add, except that Enzo is gifted with not only the ability to prepare and serve outstanding pasta dishes, but he impresses customers like me, with his phenomenal MEMORY.  When I first moved to Las Vegas (1992), I regularly patronized his place, not only because the food was fantastic, but because it was close to my residence.  Then, I moved too far away to regularly visit, but when I came back a few years later (I had moved back into my former area), I was amazed that he recognized me and greeted me by name.  Enzo is a \"Kitchen Magician,\" when it comes to preparing \"Old Country\" Italian Pasta dishes, from recipes passed down to him from family members when he was younger.  He moved to Las Vegas from New York City, which has, as everyone knows, 20 million Italian Pizza Ristorantés.  In Las Vegas, there's only ONE Enzo, and only ONE place to go, if you want the very finest in Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Yum! I'd have to agree, Enzo's pizza is what I've been searching for. New York thin crust style pizza that literally just melts in your mouth. I just grabbed a slice of pepperoni for dinner to go. Seriously wishing I had ordered a box! Definitely recommend going, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"During my dark and lonely days of travel I have know many fine Italian people and I am personally offended at the stereotypes about them.  First I would like to thank Nunzio for the professional manner he runs his waste management company.  I would like to thank Pete the Cheek for his excellent service at his Long Island Auto Body shop.  Lastly I would like to think my favorite street sweeper Giuseppe Luigi Franco Peter Paul Anthony Rossi.  I like to hang out with them and sip amaretto and chew raw garlic and make pasta while watching the Godfather.  Stereotypes are wrong people. I try to tell my Italian friends that but my mouth is usually full of pizza and pasta.  One day I was hanging out with my pisans and they made the radical suggestion that we try an Italian place to eat.  I love Italian food, but in Las Vegas finding good Italian food is like finding a stripper that doesn't know what Charlie Sheen's tongue taste like or what the tattoo on Dennis Rodman's taint says.  Not impossible but too difficult to put forth the effort.    They suggest that we go to Enzo's.  It just sounds right. It just sounds good. Say it out loud. Enzo's. Enzo's. Enzo's.  It is like a retarded person saying \"endzone.\" Beautiful.  So we drive there. It is in a strip mall. Good sign. It is like being on Long Island...except there is no Trader Joe's on Long Island...and if it is I am sure that it is full of organic box wine, jug wine, wine coolers and other really sad items.  We park and walk into the nondescript restaurant.  My expectations were low.  The place from the outside was uninspiring.  Pete the Cheek licked his lips. I threw up the bottle of cough syrup I had drank in the car. Guido bastard ruined my buzz. This food better be good.  Despite the fact that Giuseppe brought his monkey and organ grinder and Nunzio kept yelling \"that's a spicy meatball\" every 30 seconds...but he didn't order meatballs...and they all had dirt on them from burying a guy for not paying the vig...it was really great. The food was terrific.  I have gone back several times since and I can't say one bad thing about the food.  This is going to be ritzy kind of food, it isn't the gourmet Italian food that you get on the strip for 40 bucks a plate.  This is just really great strip mall Italian food than never lets you down and doesn't blow out your wallet.  The first thing I had with my friends was the Chicken Parm lunch special. When you go there you get a salad, drink, garlic knots and gelato for 10 bucks. There are like 7 specials including stuffed shells, lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs and others.  For the price it is the best lunch deal in miles. Since that first day I have tried the pasta, the lasagna and more.  The chicken parm and the lasagna are the best. The pasta is good but needs some more oil on the pasta and more sauce.  They tend to under sauce the pasta slightly.  The garlic knots are good, but they need to be a little softer. Sometimes they are overcooked and not as good as the ones that are perfectly cooked, moist and filled with garlic and oil. The gelato is great and they claim it is made in town. It is very rich and creamy. Good ending to the meal.  If you are looking for high priced food with ambiance, nice dishes...that fancy place to bring a date...or sob violently because you are dating a girl with one eye, one leg and one kidney...this isn't the place for you. If you and your part time freak want to go out and eat a good meal...go to Enzo's.  Tell them Rex sent you...actually...because of an incident that involved me throwing bleach into former friends beady little eyes...don't mention Rex.  Rex hates you. Rex loves himself. Rex wishes that was true."}
{"text":"Love the food, Hate that I unwittingly dated the son of the owner and can no longer go there. Great food, but not worth the akward...so whats been going on lately thing while I wait for food. So ladies, eat the food, not the server lol."}
{"text":"Enzo's gives you wings! I don't know what they are putting in the sauce, but last night I could not stop stuffing my face with this delicious pizza and can't stop wishing I had some in front of me right now.   Margherita pizza, garlic knots and bucket of fingers ordered and delivered within 25 minutes flat! WORK! They even remembered my extra ranch and hot sauce. I thought for certain the pie would be undercooked since we received it in warp speed time, but hell no. It was perfectly crisp in all the right places. I feel like the sauce is seasoned better than other places. They don't just slap tomato sauce down. They care about what they are serving and you can taste it in every single bite. Unless that bite misses your mouth and ends up on your shirt. The crust is not the crust you leave on the plate or feed to the dogs either. You dip that lovin in Ranch like a champion! The chicken fingers paired with their HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, homemade Ranch dressing here could possibly be my favorite in town. No joke. I'm also nuts for the knots. Garlic knots which I kept sneaking back into the kitchen for more. I'm hooked.   This feast along with one of the best episodes of  Southpark made for a perfect night in.  Hilarious!!!!  http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/10/south-park-broadway-bro-down.html  Point of the story is this. Enzo's has been in Green Valley since I can remember. Unlike Kim Kardashian's fake marriage(I knew it wouldn't last)  this restaurant  will be going strong until the end of time if I have anything to say about it. A family owned business that's consistently delivering  5 Stars across the board each and every time.   ENZO'S FOR LIFE, BABY!!!"}
{"text":"Why is this place still open? Staff are unfriendly at best, and rude generally. Asking for simple things like a bread plate for the bread knots is apparently an inconvenience.   The tv is blaring some obnoxious news station and she blatantly ignored multiple requests to change the station. My daughter first asked and she rudely just said no.   The pizza slice my daughter got was so greasy, that it dripped off in this reddish-orange greasy liquid. She refused to eat it.   I ordered eggplant pasta, which was okay, but nothing special, especially for $11 a plate.  It's a dive. If you like that sort of place, then you might like it here. But, just be aware that they don't charge \"dive\" prices."}
{"text":"Place is way overpriced , food is mediocre! There are alot better pizza joints  in H enderson, and this is not one of them!"}
{"text":"I've asked for extra basil on my pizza for the LAST 3 ORDERS this place can't get it right the food is also sub par don't waste your money on this place ,its junk!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good!  Inside the restaurant is dark gloomy and dated!   Owner or who seems to be the owner is rude unpleasant and seems to be prejudice or racist! My family and I came in for a slice of pizza and when we asked for ranch he replied  we pay now and you guys always need dipping sauce ...   Really! You should be happy to have our business, maybe we need sauce bc of a lack of flavor! Whatever our reason for using sauce is our business!    We watched ppl eat then pay but I guess we \"look like the type of ppl who would run out on our bill  With all this being said maybe the owner is the  reason there's a help wanted sign outside and no one to help him take order or serve ppl who stayed and eat!    Ok I'm done! GOD bless"}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day dinner. It was pretty empty. The guy who served us was very attentive. Always filled our cups up, gave us napkins and stuff like that. We ordered one of the deals that came with pizza, chicken fingers and garlic knots. The food came one pretty fast. Everything came out to perfection! Probably some of the best chicken fingers I've had in awhile. Great place to take your family."}
{"text":"We ordered from Enzos Pizza Sunday October 29th through Grub Hub. The food was delivered on time however our order was incorrect and the food was bad. We ordered Shrimp Alfredo and there was no Alfredo sauce. The Philly cheese steak was only burnt bread, burny steak and a little cheese. Very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"I just ate at Enzo's today, it's a cute little Italian place! The staff was super nice and helpful when I couldn't decide what I wanted. To my surprise and what I though was cool is that we actually had Enzo himself take our order, and cook it! We got pizza, and it was super yummy. A little greasy but yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is my spot! I call in my orders for delivery and they are always on time. I think it's the owner who answers the phone and he can come across as a grump but I think it's a New York thing. I recommend anyone who likes pizza and a great chicken Parmesan!"}
{"text":"We ordered some hot sandwiches and chicken strips to go from Enzo's. It was overall a decent meal, a little over priced for what you get however.5 little chicken strips for $10 was not good value compared to competitor portions vs price. The sandwiches and fries were good, but again they cut corners with portion size which really pissed off a few of the guys.   Food was really good, not sure we will go back for lack of value."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch, they have many specials. I usually get 2 slices with a topping and dink for under $7. Not the best pizza but it is decent and consistant. The owner is normally behind the counter and cooking always in a chipper mood. Deserts are no the best being they are frozen.Give them a try."}
{"text":"If you are looking for true New York style pizza, this is the place to come to.  Well made, fold-it-up type NY pizza.  And my daughter can eat a whole order of the garlic knots herself!  Come here and come often!!"}
{"text":"Went in and was craving soup, most italian place will carry a pasta fagioli or minestrone. The guy at the counter said they carried the latter. I asked if I could taste it, he said no because it's made to order. Ummm what ? Then went on to tell me soup could be made in a couple minutes by throwing things together boiling them and \"you have soup\". Yeah, so anyone who cooks can tell you soup isn't made in a couple minutes, I'm guessing the zeal they have for cooking soup can be found in their other items based on others reviews of the food here. We chose not to dine here based on his idea of boiled items as soup. In addition his attitude and their customer service was non-existent."}
{"text":"\"Pretty good pizza\" says someone from the East Coast. Be ready for some New York attitude too. Don't take it personally!  I've only had plain slices and veggie."}
{"text":"I probably won't be ordering from Enzo's again. For starters, the lady who took my order was rude...I believe she is the owner's wife. She wasn't friendly at all and didn't even give me a time span of when the food would be delivered. Instead she said \"we'll see you in a little bit\". Really? Because to me, a little bit is 5 minutes. They showed up 50 minutes later.   We ordered the garlic knots, hot wings and a 3 topping pizza. The garlic knots were alright, nothing special. I think they should probably be saved for a dine-in experience when you receive them piping hot. The wings were good although could have used a bit more sauce.   Ok, so our pizza order was a little complicated. It actually wasn't but apparently nobody understood our request. We ordered a pizza covered entirely with onion and jalapeno, half pepperoni and half olives. There were three of us who all have different likes thus the \"complicated\" order. We received the pizza and it was all screwed up. Three slices were covered in olives. Two slices had onions. Four slices had pepperoni and then a few jalapenos thrown on three slices by the crust. I called in to let them know they messed up and I get the wife on the phone. She asks me to explain what I ordered and what I received. Halfway through the conversation without notice, she hands the phone to who I assume is Enzo. He asks me to explain what happened and I tell him and while I'm talking he starts yelling at his wife. Um I suggest you wait until the customer is off the phone before your start your domestic dispute. He offered me a free topping for my next order. 1) I won't order from there again and 2) JUST ONE TOPPING?!??! Seriously? Ughhhh!   Anyway, the pizza was alright. A little greasy for my taste but the crust was good. Very light and fluffy.  I won't be going back to Enzo's."}
{"text":"Food is OVER priced SON needs a BEATING to say the least   RUDE family and discourteous   F them"}
{"text":"Yeah so Enzo is still rude and has a nasty attitude. He obviously doesn't read Yelp reviews. I'm never going back there again. Mediocre and nasty customer service! I think it's time to retire !"}
{"text":"Expensive, poor customer service but some of the best quality pizza around. I got the Sicilian thick crust pizza for the super bowl and it was made right on time for pick up. However, the people working there(looked like the husband and wife owners) were not friendly at all. It was kind of like, \"here you go here's your pizza, you're gonna enjoy it now give us $30 and get out of here.\"  The pizza was awesome, maybe the best deep dish pizza I've ever had but again, not very friendly service and expensive."}
{"text":"While the folks that work here are very nice and the service is great, they need to have more homemade ingredients in the dishes/ I got the sausage pizza slice which was great. I would suggest not getting the chicken fingers and fries, clearly not something they excel at. Chicken comes in on a truck and was something that you can get just about any place these days."}
{"text":"It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter.   Long story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said \"No.\" \"I can't use it?\" \"No.\"   Oh. Alright.  I was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.  No big loss for either of us, I suppose!"}
{"text":"We had our dinner catered from this place. The chicken pastas and lasagna were good, but the eggplant parmesan was incredible. I wasn't even that hungry, and I do eat meat, but eggplant parmesan was just so good. It's even better than Maggiano's.  Soo psyched for leftovers."}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here since I moved here 16 years ago. Everytime I come in Enzo already knows my order. I like my pizza thin and crispy and he always makes it great, I'm super picky about chicken wings and they are great! The sause is awesome and they're always cooked perfect. Don't even get me started on the garlic knots they're so addicting!! I always get the special Large pizza with 10 wings and 12 knots for $23 great deal! I read some previous negative posts and couldn't believe it. The whole family is so nice Margaret and her son always chat with me while i wait for my to go order. Love mom and pop places like this. Everytime I go in Enzo is always working hard in the kitchen, I don't think that guy ever takes a day off. Highly recommend I order to go for my family every Friday night."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salads! Iove the garden salad w mozzarella cheese and their house Italian dressing is THE BEST! I could drink it! I just bought some extra containers to bring home. Their pizza is done right, just so great! We live in north west Vegas but anytime we have to go to Henderson we make it a point to eat here, I would probably even make a special trip if I had no reason to go to Henderson anymore. :) thanks Enzo's!"}
{"text":"I really really like their margarita pizza ( I don't know if I'm spelling it correctly).  The crust is thin and crisp, the sauce taste like they add clamato and tons of garlic to it.  And simple, cheese, garlic, tomatoes, and basil.    Ordered 5 times, four times it was good.  One time it was soggy.  They only reason I don't order more often is it is was too expensive for me to eat unless I am absolutely craving it specifically.  With tax, tip and everything $28 for a large pizza.    Between me and my roommate it's not enough to keep us full."}
{"text":"The garlic knots were amazing, the pizza was hot, fresh, and perfect. I can't believe my husband waited seven years to take me here."}
{"text":"Enzo's is, in a word, terrific! I had lived a block from this little Italian restaurant for more than a year before I discovered them. Like some other reviewers, I felt that perhaps the service could have been friendlier; that said, however, the staff was not unfriendly, per se, and the food more than makes up for what this establishment may be lacking in personality. The crust of the pizza is delectable;  it is light, fluffy and crispy, with wonderful flavor! I am ordinarily not a crust-eater, but with the side of ranch that was provided free of charge and without even being requested, I dipped and ate every last bite! The service was prompt, and the pizza was simply delicious! On another, perhaps unimportant note, my five year old had to visit the restroom while we were there, and the restroom was clean and well-stocked, which is always a pleasant surprise!   We will not hesitate to return to Enzo's, and will likely go out of our way to visit if we someday move from the Green Valley area. Next time, if we can resist their pizzas, we'll be checking out the pasta!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Nothing special, service good. Salad mostly iceberg lettuce. Pizza sauce too plain for my taste."}
{"text":"Awful. Been here several times I have lived here for 16 years. This is the last time I'll come. Came in at 2:00pm and there was another couple across the room that was just served plated of salad. We sat down, the old man, I assume is the owner didn't even come to us, he yelled from the across the room and asked if we knew what we wanted and we were still deciding and he walked away. Yelled at us about our drink order. Gave it to us in styrofoam cups instead of glasses like the other couple that was there. Didn't even bring it to us. Our slices of pizza were ready and didn't even bring them to us, just left them at the counter and yelled how much our bill was. We came to sit down for lunch, not be treated like we were at a fast food establishment. To top it off, the old man was friendly to the couple that was here before we came in and went to there table to serve them. I'm so shocked this place is still open for business after all these years. These owners are so rude and the wait staff (if any) are also rude as well. Always act annoyed and never friendly. I would never come back ever."}
{"text":"Over priced, boring and bland. Place looks like it should for a NY style pizza joint... But it sure doesn't deliver. I can't believe they are even allowed to call that tasteless piece of cardboard pizza! Sadly, I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"hmmm....what to say...I mean the food was okay..bland and over priced. The owner, who is also the cook is nice..his wife didn't seem too interested in helping us. Will we go again? Sadly no...I'm all for family owned businesses but some may need to throw in the towel."}
{"text":"A few years after an unpleasant visit to Enzo's , when a nasty attitude caused us to walk out before ordering, I decided to give it a second try.   If I were writing this review a few years back,  I would've given Enzo's one star and make them the leading listing on a \"Failed Remedial Business Skills 101\" list. The deal was that my brother and myself walked inside around 3 p.m. At any rate, instead of being greeted warmly, the older woman snapped something about we cannot get the lunch special. This was approximately two minutes past the end of the lunch special.  And why did she assume we wanted the lunch special?  Immediately afterwards we left and took our business elsewhere. This experience left us with a terrible impression of Enzo's.     A couple of apartment leases later, I returned to Enzo's for the lunch special.  I peaked inside to see if the older woman was there. It seemed safe. The restaurant was relatively empty. Maybe other people had had similar experiences here. The younger woman at the counter was pleasant. I got past the walking out before I order stage,  and paid $6 plus change for the lunch special.     The lunch special includes two slices of New York pizza and medium soda. Soda refills are 50 cents. The pizza could hold its own to a decent New York pizzaria. Enzo's Pizza literally gives a slice of New York's food culture to Henderson Nevada. Still I have tasted better pizza in the Las Vegas valley.     I am giving Enzo's three stars. A future review could keep it the same rating or change it. If I come in around 3:02 p.m., and am given an attitude,  there will be a new list on Yelp. Enzo's had been an example of a restaurant serving good food that turns away business with lousy customer service."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good here. I would give the place 3.5-4 stars on the food alone.  However, I gave it 2 stars because the service is downright horrible.  I mostly order delivery and whenever I call they seem pissed that I'm calling. This could be a great place if they would improve the customer service."}
{"text":"First thing I did was open the box and the pizza was small.. box is 18\" but the pizza is only 15\" second the pizza slices were all different sizes third it came ice cold and the bottom was burnt! I cannot believe someone hates their job so much to send that out!! I will NEVER be ordering from this place again! If I could give a negative star I would!"}
{"text":"Ended up picking this place randomly while waiting to go to a movie once, and am so glad.  This place has the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life.  I no longer live in Vegas, but anytime I go back I always have to stop here.  Just make sure to get extra cheese.   :)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here and if you go ask Enzo to make it extra crispy!!! Also order some garlic knots and sprinkle some parmesan cheese all over them mmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here about a week ago and never got around to writing a review..so here we go .   I placed the order for baked ziti and it comes with garlic knots on the side. The sauce was flavorless, and and the noodles were a bit soggy. Bread is always my favorite part of any meal,  and the garlic knots were cold and hard. Very disappointing. And they barely had any seasoning on them.   The service was great but the food itself was not good."}
{"text":"I have to lower the rating on this place. While the service and food are pretty good, I can't STAND being charged extra money for condiments that should come with your food when you're eating in the restaurant.   I'm sorry, but I don't enjoy being nickel and dimed 60 cents for some frigging ranch. It costs you less than $2 per bottle, and for a table of two you're making $30ish after drinks and whatnot."}
{"text":"bad pizza,cold garlic knots we will never go again bad ,bad service never again........got to be the worst service the worst food ever...."}
{"text":"The service was poor as they told me they would honor my coupon and then rescinded after we ate our food (this was a few years back).  The food was mediocre for \"homemade\" Italian....Maybe it's improved since then? Cheers"}
{"text":"The lady was rude af. When i talked to her, she pretended like i didn't  even exist. The order was delayed like 30 minutes then i asked the guy in the back. He blamed my friend. The discrimination was real. The food was not even good and service was like sh*t. I didnt come here to ask for free food. What the f ! I cant believe this place stil survive."}
{"text":"The sauce is not the same. They use a jar sauce that is pre-made. I used to love coming here. I want the owner to see this so he can go back to his original food which used to be amazing. Stop hiring mexicans; they have no clue about pizza."}
{"text":"My friend's and I have been going to Enzo's since we were in highschool.  Now, 15 years later, it is still my go to pizza joint.  Weather getting a basic pizza, or manacotti, stuffed shells, lasagna, whatever!  Everything is delicious.  I dream about their garlic knots for weeks.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Definitely two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fresh and much better than the chains around here, but man does their service suck. The guys on the phone are just plain rude and if they didn't make such a good pizza, I wouldn't order from them. Green Valley is in need of better pizza joints, but until more places with good pies come up, we just have to deal with the bad customer service."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have been here several times ant the service has been excellent. Perhaps they were just having a bad day. Food is consistent and tasty. I Love the house Pizza with the meatballs and the garlic knots =)"}
{"text":"Enzo is just so cute. He treats his pizzas like his children. Get the Sicilian with a fizzy. The atmosphere is a little hokey, but at least it's clean."}
{"text":"Came in around 7 p.m. thinking it's worth a shot of I can try by the slice. I should have got a whole dang pizza. So freaking delicious! Great ingredients.  Perfect thin type crust! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has the best baked ziti.. i highy recommend this when at Enzo's.. prices are decent very small hole in the wall located in the green valley shopping center near trader joe's.. I would suggest going on a beautiful day and enjoy the weather and sit outside. Staff is friendly, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to work in the plaza with Enzo's, so it was a convenient thing to eat on my lunch/dinner breaks.  The service is very hit or miss.  Sometimes the staff seems to bend over backwards to make you happy, and at other times they make you feel like you are an inconvenience.  Whatever.  The pizza is pretty generic.  As others have said, the sausage is good.  The sauce is pretty boring.  However, the crust is nice - light and fluffy.  Topping distribution is really odd.  I ordered a pizza there tonight, and there were FIVE pepperoni slices baked on top of each other, while other slices had none.  Weird.    Oh, and don't order a dinner salad.  It's literally just lettuce on a plate.  Overall, my fiance and I eat at Enzo's when we're sick of everything else.  It's not exactly something I crave, but it's okay.  EDIT 07/10/12:  I took away an additional star.  While my review regarding the food quality stands as written, the service has gone downhill... if that's even possible.  Enzo can be so damn crabby sometimes that I feel like cowering in a corner if I need to ask for something.  Why would I waste money at a place like Enzo's when there are so many alternatives?  If you want to try some great local pizza with likewise great service, try the new Bistro Pizza on Gibson.  It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon between a quick stop at Trader Joe's and watching football at Dylan's. I asked to see the pizza since the sign says it's sold \"by the slice\" and the man who claimed to be the owner went to the walk in and pulled out a raw Sicilian with sauce put on to show it to me. That's right they put the sauce on the raw dough and refrigerate it. It must be tough to ladle the sauce on the pizza dough since their were all of 2 customers there and the phone was not ringing. I'll describe customer service as \"eccentric\" and leave it at that. I got the Sicilian with an antipasto salad for $27 as take out. I lived/worked in NYC for 20 years and if anyone tried to sell pizza like this they would have been out of business at best or sleeping with the fishes at worst. This was the first time I remember throwing out pizza, and the salad was a joke too. Whoever thinks this is good should sue their surgeon because they messed up their lobotomy."}
{"text":"good, solid Pie  NY style, paper thin crust, nice burnt dough bubbles in the crust, toppings seem to mesh well...pizza by the slice...  Ideal spot to hit after the club."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new for dinner and had a craving for some pasta. I ordered linguini with MARINARA, yet it came loaded with chunks of ground beef. Not even meatballs that I might have been able to push to the side, but meat chunks mixed into the sauce.  Well, that was a bust so I opened up the garlic knots which I usually love but these were hard as rocks and severely lacking in buttery, garlicky goodness. And they didn't come with any sauce.  The salad was decent, the dressing was actually quite good and the cheesecake was ok. They delivered on time but I'm not going to give the restaurant credit for that because we ordered through Postmates. And I'm glad we did because the other reviews say that if you order from them they're not nice so at least we dodged that bullet.  It looks like I'm not alone here and we probably won't try this place again any time soon."}
{"text":"Handspun New York style pizza!  Favorite pizza place in Vegas by far.  This is the closest I've come to finding authentic NY style pizza.  The crust was perfect and the pizza was huge.  The prices aren't bad and the service friendly.    Try an order of garlic knots, they're heaven."}
{"text":"Enzo is the BEST!!! You will not find a better pizza joint in ALL of Vegas... And this is coming from a Metro Pizza fanatic!  This little gem is located in a shopping mall on Green Valley and Sunset (by Trader Joes).  There is a small dinning room with booths and tables.   I've tried their pizzas, calzones, garlic knots, and sandwiches. All which tasted like authetic New York pizza! The service is quick. The store is clean. The staff is friendly.  Enzo's is great for take out and they have a limited delivery area. Now my go-to pizza jizz-oint! Hey-o!"}
{"text":"Poor costumer service and and the food is mediocre I'll never go back nor recommend this place"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite with the family before a movie. I had had lunch here before but it was the families first time. I give it up to Enzo who does everything himself. First was garlic knots which were great crisp and perfect amount of butter and garlic. The pizza is so good perfect crispy ness on the crust and the sauce has such good flavor! The chicken fingers were not too sauces and nice crisp. This is our go to pizza place for this area!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas, hands down. Just picked up a slice, reminds me of Via Napoli at Walt Disney World....the best."}
{"text":"Tried this place out since I live right around the corner from the shopping center.  If you go during lunch the parking lot is crazy, probably because of Weiss Deli next door and the Trader Joe's.  I got the lunch special of two slices and a drink.  Luckily they had just pulled out a fresh pizza so I was out of there and back to work in about 5 minutes.  Great cheese pizza and I loved the crust.  It was crispy and done just right.  Another time I got the family meal of a cheese pizza, wings, and garlic knots.  The pizza was again great again and the garlic knots were good as well.  We ordered the wings mild but when we got home and opened the box there was no sauce on them.  Not sure what happened there.  We made sure to ask for blue cheese instead of ranch and it was thick and creamy.  Definately better than most blue cheese at other places.  Not sure about the other reviews concerning service, but both times I've been we had no issues with how we were treated."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Wings, garlic knots, pepperoni pizza. Garlic knots were good. Pizza was fair. Wings dry and flavorless. Would not order again."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was alittle kid, definitely has declined in food quality. Pizza tasted like it was soaked in water covered in an unreasonably amount of olives and onions. My salad was drenched in ranch, and only 4 croutons. Only thing to look forward to is the Spumoni and garlic knots."}
{"text":"I got the \"Meat Lovers\" pizza for takeout.: ham, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, meatball. By the looks of the place, I'm glad I got it to go. The pizza was okay. Just like a hundred other meat lovers pizzas at other pizza joints. It won't knock your socks off."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and am just not impressed. Ok, the garlic knots are good, big whoop it is not rocket science. The first time I went in for lunch specials. I had to walk up and return my salad because the lettuce was disgustingly wilted. I was given another, the same. :( Served with bottled ranch, double sad face. Now here is the breakdown of their salad: Iceberg lettuce that is at least three days already cut and wilted, peeled carrots that have been cut into chunks by a three year old (no seriously, it is comical) and a wedge of green tomato. What? And it wasn't just the one time, nor the second time I exchanged it but also the same three weeks later when I ventured out again. The second time I had the salad, (which I did not eat, it just came with the meal) and eggplant parmesan. I have eaten eggplant parmesan many many places, and this was the worst. Ever. Ever. And it was a daily chef special. What? Nothing special here, and I didn't eat it. I let the bf enjoy his pizza and we left. I will not be back.  Home made ranch is expected when you go out and it is not hard to make. Salads are easy to make fresh and don't cost much. Losing guests because of bad attitudes and crappy food should not be an issue for a mom and pop place, ever. Put work into your product, or have you forgotten how to cook with love?"}
{"text":"Bad food, Bad Service, Bad Price!!! Pizza dough was so mushy and the NY-combo pizza was too oily and not tasty at all! The side salad looked like it came straight out of out-dated market package. It was terrible! I should've known when I first walked in. There was only 1 table occupied and I found out later it was the owner lady and her friend X( Anyway, sad to see a local business not doing well but it's kinda easy to see why..."}
{"text":"Love Enzo's Pizza.  I grew up in Green Valley and this place has been a staple of the GV community since I was a kid.  Loved this place 20 years ago and still love it today.  Great NY style pizza, awesome wings and the best garlic knots in town!!! Family owned and operated with a casual, NY family style atmosphere.  Makes me miss my college days in NYC..."}
{"text":"Second time there last night, I tried the daily special baked ziti, after debating going with the same meal as last time (chicken parm with angel hair pasta) or trying something new. The owner was the one taking our order, asked what I was debating between and told her. Of course, my first choice was \"one of our best\", which made me question ordering anything else. After confirming that the baked ziti is one of her other favorites, I gave it a shot.  Our food came out, and my ziti was incredibly hot, when they say baked, they take it from the oven, directly to your table! Once it cooled down enough to not scald my mouth, the flavors of the sauce and cheese complimented each other quite well.   We were there toward the end of the night, the service was still OK, nothing incredible but good. If the pasta did not split apart and fall off the fork it would have been a bit easier to eat.  Being that my wife keeps getting \"alright\" food, not sure if we will go back together again."}
{"text":"This is our (myself and my girlfriend) pizza place. First of all I like to support a private owner shop over a corporate owned place. Second the food is good! It's the only place near us thatc has pizza by the slice. And not just pizza but a whole menu of good stuff."}
{"text":"Decent pizza customer service is decent also. If your looking for a step up of Pizza Hut or dominoes this is your place."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are DELICIOUS!!!!! Make sure you get the hot ones cuz the mild don't have any kick to them.  Pizza and garlic knots were also tasty.  We come here every time we visit Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Chicken Parmesan was really bland. Service just wasn't what we expected being a local spot. Server seemed uninterested and busy"}
{"text":"Food was not good. Fries bland and under cooked. Chicken fingers ok. Catchup was in a nasty bottle. Staff not friendly and I know why they didn't ask how everything was. That's because it was not good."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this is the worst Italian food I have ever eaten.  I ordered Eggplant Parm and it was, to say the least, disgusting.  The breading was soggy and the dish tasted like it had been sitting for days.  I was looking forward to eating here after reading the other reviews on Yelp however I will never give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I was born. We still enjoy it. Enzo and Margaret are some of the nicest people and the food has always been delicious. Definitely a family restaurant. Also great catering."}
{"text":"Ive lived in Vegas for 2 months and this place is as good as it gets, for me anyway. Im really picky about my pizza, being a Cali girl and all.   I ordered a medium pep and waited about 15 minutes. There was some crazy drama while I was there, but that was totally not the employees fault. The chick was crazed. Anyway, the dough was delish, the sause was yummy with a lil spice that I like. It was $15 for that. I'll try those garlic knots next time. I hear they are yummy."}
{"text":"So my hunny tells me he wants some pasta for dinner tonight and I go hunting for something good for him online.  He's a really picky guy when it comes to Italian food so I try my best to find something that will please my NY fella.  I saw the reviews from yelpers and its really close to my house so I say.. why not... and I call and our fate was sealed.  First the phone order was great.  I had a few questions for the girl who answered and she was great at answering everything I needed.  I placed an order with extras and she was really nice about it.  She was even nice when he changed his mind about 2 times about his dressing.  She told me about 15 minutes till it would be ready.  He ordered the baked ziti with meat sauce added, a meatball and sausage, with garlic knots, and a salad.  When I got there the son and a girl was behind the counter.  We chatted about how I found them (on yelp)  and they were super nice.  The girl gave me a take home menu and some coupons.  I have to admit I was a bit surprised at the cost (over $18) and I hoped it would really be impressive for my sweetie.  So I get home and he digs in, and I wait and see what hes going to say.  My NY Italian loving man is head over heels for the food at Enzo's!  He tells me the garlic knots are really good and the salad is good (your basic salad) but the ziti is phenomenal.  He says the meat sauce has just the right amount of sweetness and the sausage and meatball were fantastic.  He completely cleared out the container and is using the last garlic knot to mop up the rest of the sauce.  He can't get enough of it.  He paid this place the biggest compliment.  When his mom comes to visit from back east he wants to bring her to Enzo's for a dinner.  That is a big compliment for anyone who understands mamas :)  So based on his enthusiastic endorsement of Enzo's I will be trying this place myself soon and recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"I recently enjoyed two meals at Enzo's.  On the first occasion only Enzo and I were present after I asked at the door at 9:10 p.m. what time the restaurant closed and was told, \"Ten minutes ago.  But come on in and I'll take care of you.\"  The second was for pizza with Diane and friends just a few days ago.  On the first visit, after a Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing I enjoyed some complimentary Garlic Knots (since otherwise they would have been thrown out) and a filling meal of Sausage & Peppers.  Chef-owner Enzo does not scrimp on portions, and I had an ample amount of sausage lengths to devour, along with both Green and Red Peppers nicely enfolded together in a tasty Pomodoro Sauce.  On the second stop, the Garlic Knots were big, freshly made, and chewy.  Another Dinner Salad with Italian Dressing, greens, and a few pieces of tomato and carrot was nothing special but a serviceable beginning.  The pizza, however, was sublime.  A great thin-crust Neapolitan pizza with supple dough, plenty of sauce and melted cheese, and this time five ingredients: tomato, mushroom, sausage, pepperoni, and cashews.  The cashews were brought in by Diane, and Enzo graciously accommodated our request to add them as a topping on our 16-inchers.  Our friends split an 18-inch pizza, so pizza was omnipresent on our table top.  The pizza was delicious, even though the sausage packed a spice that lingered in the mouth for awhile.  To offset the sausage's kick, the pepperoni was mild.  Service was very good; our waiter somehow remembered me from a single stop over 3 years ago.  The ambiance inside our dining room was casual, and our booth seating was quite  comfortable.  Food came out quickly, too, even though the place was humming with several diners in our midst.  4-1.2 stars overall for the Sausage & Peppers, Garlic Knots, and fine pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Enzo's was very delicious!!! I went with 2 other people and we got a large pizza, garlic knots and an order of wings for $20.00. That was a great deal! The owner was extremely nice and very friendly! I liked the feeling of being in a place that was family owned. The son came just after we got our food and made sure our drinks were filled and that we were doing okay. I would highly recommend this place if you love good tasting pizza and a cozy environment."}
{"text":"I ordered the family special with the pizza fingers and garlic knots last night.Got sausage mushrooms on my half. I ended up with food poisoning with vomiting and diarrhea several hours after eating the food. The first time I have been here and definitely the last. On top of this they were rude on the phone while ordering and bickering amongst themselves while picking up the order."}
{"text":"Needed a pizza fix while overnighting in Henderson.  Yelp didn't let me down.  Enzo's makes a great New York Style thin crust pizza.  The pepperoni and sausage are just like you get in New York.  They have a small dining area (about 8-10 tables) or you can order take out as I did (was ready in 15 minutes).  Delivery is also available in a limited area.  I would definitely recommend these guys."}
