{"text":"Great first impression. Delicious and great staff. But second visit was disappointing. My mission burrito was basically all rice with a sliver of a piece of carne asada. Disappointing second visit. Hope it was just a Friday night fluke...?"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food taco places I have ever ate at.  I originally received an email for one free taco after signing up for their newsletter.  My husband and I tried it out for lunch and it was so good we went back for dinner.  Then a week ago I was a winner and received a $25 gift card.  Today we went for lunch had the tacos again and a caramel churro.  The bill was over by about $3 and they called it even.  There are not many places that have amazing food and great customer service.  This place has both.  Definitely will be frequently Me Gusta Tacos!!!  Can't wait to try them for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The California burrito is to die for. If I could I would eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place ! Amazing flavors and good location being in front of the splash pad! Friendly staff and a must try for yourself especially if you have kids in the summer when the splash pad is on. Agua Fresca drinks are so good. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a great taco/ Mexican flavor. Also the salsas are so tasty !!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for a while. We try it out once and it is fantastic! So imaginative, delicious, and simple. It just goes to prove the old adage; do what you know and do it well. Tonight however we had planned to dine at their next-door neighbor do and proper. We had never been there before, and no one I knew had been there before. That was my mistake. We waited an hour and a half to have no food, no drink refills, and Voraciously empty stomachs. Our party wondered hungrily to this taco stand, and were treated properly served with a smile, all in a timely fashion. WARNING  Do not go to do & proper! They Suck!"}
{"text":"Ordered this place via uber eats not really knowing what to expect. Got the shrimp burrito and added black beans. Seriously THEE BEST shrimp burrito ever!! It was so delicious! And the guac was on point!! Highly recommend and will DEF be going back!"}
{"text":"First off this place was too small. Food was mediocre for the price and taste. Their is no comfortable seating. You constantly have to ask for ice and water. This place has no drink station. Customer service was nonexistent. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Great location with minimalistic, hipster vibes. They offer samples of the different agua fresca flavor which are delicious. I got three tacos and was delighted when the cashier told me I could mix and match from the taco selections. I got two shredded pollo and one korean taco. It said the pollo was a best seller but in my opinion the Korean beef was the best. I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Awesome taco joint. Great food, and awesome staff! The portions are solid and the agua fresca flavors are great."}
{"text":"Loved the concept of this Asian and Mexican fusion. The tacos are delicious, but the best part was adding the homemade salsas. Try the salsa verde. You can just eat that alone with a spoon it was so good. The owner was nice as well. He came over to our table and gave us theirs homemade pineapple basil and horchata drinks to try. Will be back again"}
{"text":"We are from CA and used Yelp to find this place. What a gem!  Great Mexican food without the typical grease and lard. Salsa was unique and wonderful. Sangria was innovative and yummy. Will go to again when back in Vegas. Wish it was a franchise so I could own one."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and lots of different choices. There are healthy options if you're looking for something lighter. They also have loaded tater tots if you're looking for some yummy junk food. Their agua fresca is delicious. I'm a huge fan of the pineapple basil. They're even better as a sangria. I have become a regular here and have yet to experience anything but excellent customer service. The staff here is extremely friendly and open to questions. They come around and pick up your plates and ask if you need anything else and it's not even a sit down place! I see the owner there often and he is extremely humble and friendly. All I can say is, this place is doing it right!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what the district needed! The Carne Asada California burrito was really good. Can't wait to go back. Me Gusta. 

Also, we had a guest with us that is sensitive to guten, and they took the time to go line by line with their ingredients to accommodate her."}
{"text":"Really good fusion tacos! Tried the Vietnamese? ban mi taco, Korean bbq taco, and carne asada. I really thought they were very fresh and well seasoned. Not spicy at all, but the have red and green hot sauce in squeezee bottles if you like it hot. Definitely? give this place a try for some yummy tacos."}
{"text":"The food here is a good. I enjoy korean-mexican fusion and this place does a pretty good job. I've had better but that's not to say the food here isn't good. I really enjoy the California burrito with kalbi. I've also tried the mission burrito with kalbi and it's good but the California burrito is definitely better in my opinion. The salsa's here are also good. The habanero is a little too sweet and spicy for me though. The salsa roja is great though. The bavarian cream churro is also really good. 

PS. Remember to check in! You get a complimentary agua fresca."}
{"text":"Great fusion tacos at a reasonable price. Don't expect authentic taco styles that you're used to from a taqueria but the food is amazing with its unique little twist. The sauces are delicious. Be careful with the fairly spicy habanero sauce!"}
{"text":"My family loves Me Gusta Tacos!!   We order them weekly for delivery through Uber.  The chicken tacos are amazing and the salad dressing for the salad is out of this world.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place. Fantastic tacos and the black bean salad and salsas were great! Wow!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing new restaurant! All of the staff members were very nice, and the gal ringing us up gave us samples of the freshly made frescas; all wonderful!! The menu had a good amount of vegan and vegetarian options, and so far everything I've had has been fresh, delisous, great portion sizes, and just beautifully crafted! You must go check this new restaurant out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great prices, no fuss. Simple menu bursting with flavor. In the often overpriced District, this is a great affordable option. The splash pad location is a nice bonus for parents!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! This cute, but slightly hidden, little store is amazing. The Korean tacos and shrimp burrito were very fresh and the loaded tots were delicious. The seating both inside and out is plentiful in this delightful little shopping square. Great food, great location and excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend this spot to others and will visit again when we are back in Nevada!"}
{"text":"Delish!  Short walk from Green Valley Ranch Resort. Me Gusta Bowl with chicken was fantastic and my wife had a Mission Burrito with Carne Asada. She loved it. I even finished up with a delicious Churro. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"First visit here. About 5 people eating when I walked in. As I approached the counter I was politely greeted. Before I could respond, I was already being asked for my order.  I informed the counter person that it was my first visit and asked him what was good.  He started describing every taco on the menu which is fine, but I can also read.  Finally he revealed that the Bahn me taco was the most popular, and that the chicken was, well, chicken. Whew, I thought it was gonna be something other than chicken.....I ordered the Bahn me, the fish and the carnitas.  2.50 for a soda! Now I know why every single reason there had a water cup.  You've been warned! Bahn me taco-spit about half the filling out as it was to hard to even chew. Carnitas taco-became carnitas in a bowl as the tortilla was so soggy it disintegrated on first bite, however the flavor was good. Fish taco- the fish was so small it couldnt be seen under the mountain of red cabbage. No surprise they were trying to hide it, as fish should not be clear unless it is bad.  And the taco fell apart on fist bite. Oh, I also got a side of rice....2.50, again.  Burnt grains in the top, half cooked and crunchy on the bottom.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was about 2, maybe 3 days old. The salsas are good, especially the habanero...overall I'd say pass, unless that all sounds good to you....."}
{"text":"This place has good customer service, but the food is not that great. It's very Americanized Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious and so fresh! We ordered (in order of our favorites:
Fish taco (skipped the cream, but so good!)
Carnitas (amazing flavor...cinnamon!)
Carne Asada
Chicken (a little too bland for our taste)

Also had the pineapple basil agua fresca....nummy!

Awesome location for a beautiful Vegas day, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I order the bowl with the Korean beef, extremely good and service was great. Good location and nice music inside."}
{"text":"Very clean with good service.  Had a bowl with chicken, very flavorful.  Salsa's are excellent.  Caution with Habanero Sauce. It is as powerful as advertised.   Also, infused waters are a must."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here after shopping at the district on a Saturday afternoon. The taco shop wasn't too crowded so we got a spot at one of the high tables inside. They also have some spots outside of you prefer. We both got the vegetarian taco with chips. They have three different sauces that you can bring to your table. A classic red, a salsa verde and habanero salsa. All are so good but the salsa verde is my favorite. We also got a side of the creamy wasabi dressing to dip our tacos in..so yummy! The ingredients are all top quality and the restaurant is very clean. We only got waters to drink but they do have beer on tap and other Mexican specialty beverages available.  I will definitely go back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on the reviews. Got the \"California\" burrito and it was pretty good. I love tater tots and it is a pretty \"original\" idea to have them tucked inside the burrito to give an added \"cruch\". Taste wasn't overwhelming though that took away from the other ingredients. I chose the carne asada meat and it was flavorful and tender. I didn't care for the chips though that came as the side. They were pretty bland. I had to doctor those up pretty good with one of the salsas that were located in bottles up front. Also tried the cinnamon sugar churro as \"desert\" and that was muy delicioso! All in all pretty good addition to the District!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Food was amazing! The chicken was to die for, so delicious.

Oh and as a tip, only the most daring should try that habanero salsa    it was good though"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing them online and was extremely excited. But it is alll hype food is extremely bland no flavor for the price I was expecting some delicious tacos but was let down. Even the waters were not good I'm a big taco connoisseur and will never return again. The concept is great and have the following they need a much much better chef to revamp the whole menu service is average and waited way too long. So sad this is for people who think Taco Bell is Mexican food I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Everything we had was amazing, the agua frescas taste of perfection. Three of us ordered, I had the Anthem which was a tasty and light option, all the flavors danced together in harmony. Me and my table shared the stacked tater tots, adding shrimp which was seasoned to perfection.  All you heard at the table was mmmmm, ah, yum... so good!!! It's a must try especially if you Gusta Tacos too!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Small indoor seating area but people aren't there too long. Kind of expensive for portion you get."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and we will be back! Portion size is very generous. I tried the fish taco, pollo taco and pork. The pollo was my favorite by far. My husband had the mission burrito and loved it. The establishment is very clean and tidy. The staff member who took my order was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, excellent flavor. Quick service and a reasonable price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The tacos weren't bad but not extraordinary. I actually have had better. I found the meat to be a bit bland and kind of on the skimpy side. However, service was friendly and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place. Great food with healthy options. Awesome customer service and cute decor! I will be back often."}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday because of Instagram photos I came across and heard it's a must try. So I decided to try their surf n turf burrito and added a nice cold beer to my order. I sat outside and enjoyed my delicious meal. Looking forward to going again!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG. 

We had been holding out for our cheat meal to hit Me Gusta Tacos Up. #WorthIt

BAM - great service. Super friendly. Helpful with menu suggestions, clean!!

The food was amazing as well. We tried the California and Mission burritos. They absolutely didn't disappoint. Great flavor, yummy side salads and the food came out super quick. 

Bonus - their music that was playing was spot on."}
{"text":"Their homemade hibiscus juice was awesome! Recommend it! 

Also the home made salsa sources were very flavorful. Three different types of salsa in bottle. Freshly made at there."}
{"text":"I have driven by his place several times and I decided to give it a try FINALLY!  I was NOT impressed with the food at all.. very very disappointed.. chicken taco was extremely dry.. Carne asada taco WASNT EVEN CARNE ASADA.. the texture was so gross and squishy like jack & the box meat... And carnitas was to salty. I couldn't even put limon on my tacos either since they are greedy with those as well. For 3 tacos they gave me 1 half of a half lime.. wth!! The only thing exceptional was the salsa! Very spicy but delish. I would never go back there and eat again. Not worth my money. If the owner revamped the menu and put some Mexican love in the food it would be amazing. They need to focus on the food taste and texture rather than focus on the presentation. 

Ps NO HORCHATA or Jarritos"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!  I love their korean kalbi tacos, their chips are fresh. Shrimp burrito was also good. Their place is simple but clean. I will recommend it."}
{"text":"We were craving some Tacos and wanted to try a new place. The restaurant is located in the District at GV. When we entered we were greeted and offered free samples of their agua Fresca which was really tasty. We ordered the black bean salad with chicken, 3 tacos and the staked tarot totes. All were very good. I enjoyed those fresh salsa. Had the verde which was flavorful but not really spicy. They rated it 6/10 on the spice level. 

Is it true Mexican food... No but a good and affordable place to grab a casual bite to eat."}
{"text":"Love them! Best salsas in town in my opinion. My fave is the green one, never had anything like it! Ordered fish tacos, nachos, the bowl with kalbi last night through uber eats, i asked for extra sauces and I got 2 extra of each flavor, 6 total! all my dreams came true! :) you guys are the best. Please open another location in summerlin!"}
{"text":"Placed an order to go, basic nachos. I had never been inside so I wasn't aware it was basically an upscale fast food place. I arrived and my nachos were ready right in time. I like to think of myself as a nacho connoisseur and I found these pretty darn good. No toppings I had to pick off - I'm picky.  And it was a pretty decent price.  Will definitely give them another go, next time ordering their taco namesake."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh salsa options, great burritos and tacos served with chips, ALL-DAY BREAKFAST and lots of tater tots!  Cute place, nice staff.  Just opened.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice place and excellent service from all staff.. We 
tried 4 different tacos and my favorite was the pork belly
banh mi with the salsa verde salsa.. Definitely coming back to try the bowls and burritos.."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a bite to eat if you're in the green valley plaza. They have a spin off of traditional tacos and it's very filling! 
Their Korean kalbi tacos are a 10!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly staff , great food the steak and egg burrito is tasty and the mission burrito with the carnitas has the right flavors , the meat is tender and portions are a good size"}
{"text":"Good enviornment its mexican food with a twist would not eat their very often will probably not go back"}
{"text":"I liked me Gusta tacos! The menu isn't very big nor authentic but I enjoyed what I had. I don't really understand the few Asian items on the menu because there are too few to call it a \"fusion\" restaurant.
I got the California burrito with the carne asada. I love the concept of putting tater tots on the burrito. It was delicious but the carne asada was not anywhere near the best I've ever had. Pretty dry. But overall I liked it. The green salsa is amazing but they don't give you a lot. They should have containers near the salsa station so you can take some to go.
My boyfriend loved his burrito but said the habanero salsa was a bit too sweet. He liked how spicy it was.
We also ordered the shrimp ceviche. It was nothing special. Still good but wouldn't order again. 
Overall the staff was friendly and the portion sizes awesome. Lost a star for the dry carne asada and how our stomachs are feeling the next day, lol."}
{"text":"Love the simplicity. 
Your choice from a variety of tacos full of flavor. 
The salsas are delicious. 
And now this location offers beer and sangria."}
{"text":"I was excited about a taco place opening so close to me but this place far exceeded any of my expectations. 
I went in there day 2 of their opening and was hooked. I eat there at least once a week
The food is amazing and they just added 2 new proteins...Barbacoa and shrimp. 
If you are in the Henderson/Green Valley area, this place is a must. Chris and Lee are the owners and will welcome you with open arms."}
{"text":"It's clean and fresh and so comforting and delicious! Try all the sauces!! Don't be afraid of the yellow sauce - it's citrus base with cinnamon and cumin is amazing!! 
We went 2 days in a row!! Loved everything!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Simply delicious menu options that are always satisfying. I can never decide on what to have so I wind up getting one of  everything in seems like! My favorites are the Korean kolbi beef taco and the shredded beef barbacoa taco with housemade habanero salsa and a side of fresh guacamole. The best summertime beverage can be had here too, Pineapple Basil agua fresca  hits the spot on these hot days for sure!"}
{"text":"Me Gusta Tacos is my favorite place to eat in Henderson. 

Me Gusta Tacos is a mom and pop business with fresh ingredients and a friendly staff.  Places like Me Gusta Taco are what gives a town character and soul.  The owner Chris is amazing and is heavily involved in putting together local events in the community. 

I crave these tacos particularly the Korean Kalbi and Pork Belly Tacos.   The pineapple basil aqua fresco is also a favorite."}
{"text":"I wish I had the opportunity to get in here more often. I'm a bit of a taco addict and can tell you will little doubt that you'll love Me Gusta Tacos. 
Besides the amazing food, they keep their menu nice, simple and not over crowded with a million items that are essentially the same product, only with one tiny change to build an unnecessarily large selection. Contrary, each item is uniquely designed to its own perfection. 
I haven't tied the full menu, but I'm on a mission. 

Finally, the staff. Man, it's great to have a bunch of people that seem to be happy to be at work together. Seriously, 90% seems like they may be an owner the way they interact with the customers and are constantly doing little things to make the Me Gusta Taco experience better."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was very impressed! Had the Korean bbq and carnitas tacos. Both flavorful. I can see why the Korean tacos are the most popular. Travis was very attentive and helpful with ordering and checking up on us! Definitely planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and a very pleasant staff.
Grilled tortillas are a nice change of pace from the usual soft tortilla.  Special order done perfectly, and the fresh avocado was delicious.
We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pricey but good. They do not have the good old Mexican food you're used to. No refried beans. It's fresh-mex, healthy tacos, but good."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch with friends while i was in town for the weekend. Loved their shrimp burrito, pork belly taco and churro!"}
{"text":"These are excellent tacos! Fresh & full of flavor. My favorite are the Kalbi & the Bahn Mi. This food is simple and clean. Not frilly or covered with cheese or sauce. Just fresh food, full of flavor. I want to try the burritos & bowls, but so far I'm too obsessed with the tacos to divert. So glad to have this place close to home. And 3 tacos for under $10 at this quality is a great deal. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places. It's really simple combinations but they are SO GOOD. My favs- the pork belly taco and Korean kalbi. The meat is extremely tender and full of flavor. Paired with simple slaw but it works so well. Tacos are packed with meat. Their chips are very fresh, perfect crunch, not too salty. Green salsa is excellent on the tacos and either chips. You receive a free Agua Fresca if you FB check-in. It's extremely clean and organized. Menu is easy to read and staff is super nice. If you like tacos, please try me gusta!"}
{"text":"Me Gusta Tacos are fusion taco and burrito geniuses. We were lucky enough to try their food during their first day of business and it was so good that our whole office had to go back for lunch the following day! I always had their Henderson location on my bookmarks but never had the chance to make it out there so I was ecstatic to find out they are open really close to my workplace. This is probably going to be a dangerous thing for me because I'm probably going to end up eating here every lunch break. The service is extremely friendly and you can tell they're really passionate about their food. 

Their Kalbi Mission Burrito consists of sweet, Korean kalbi paired with pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese and spanish rice. I was also able to try the Carnitas Mission Burrito and the meat is so flavorful and tender. The Carne Asada Taco has queso fresco crumbles and it's really refreshing since I'm used to usual places just adding the typical shredded cheese.

Their salsas are awesome! Mildest to hottest-- Roja, Verde and Habanero. I'm not a fan of super spicy but a little bit of habanero on my burrito gave it an extra kick. It's sweet at first then somehow, it hits you hard at the end. It's reaaaally good. 

I also loved their Pineapple Basil Agua Fresca. You can really taste the basil but it doesn't overpower the sweetness of the pineapple juice. I was also able to try all their churros-- original, caramel filled and bavarian cream filled. All had a sweet cinnamon sugar exterior and the texture was crunchy not soggy or chewy. My favorite would have to be the bavarian cream. I think the caramel was a bit too sweet for my liking and the bavarian cream balanced out the cinnamon sugar more so I prefer that. 

You know it's so good when you're still eating your food but you're already thinking of what you'll order next when you come back. Be back real soon, Me Gusta Tacos!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty with great fresh ingredients, service is friendly and the location in the District is perfect! I had the 3 taco plate; chicken, carne asada & the kalbi. All impressed. Looking forward to trying other menu items!"}
{"text":"So I came here because I seen a picture of some good looking burritos on unlokt. It's in the district of green Valley Ranch casino. Very nice scenery here. The place is kind of small. . About 6 tables? The guy at the counter was cool. I got 2 California burittos.. they didn't really look as good as the picture lol. But they were still really good. 8 bucks and came with tortilla chips. Best part is there habenero sauce.. it's helllaaa good. Not to hot.. and it's sweet. They also have beer and wine on tap."}
{"text":"Tacos at this brand new place in the District have excellent flavor and are made with very fresh ingredients. Had a carnitas taco and Korean Kalbi taco. Both were awesome. Salsa fridge has three different salsas. The Salsa Habanero is legit. A mild sweetness to open with a nice pop of a spicy finish."}
{"text":"Fresh-Mex with a healthy slant. Located inside of the District, prices are predictably higher than your local taco truck, but the quality is also better. Located next to the splash pad, MGT is a good spot to get a bite while your kids are cooling off.

The Me Gusta Bowl with quinoa or a Black Bean Salad are both solid, healthy options with fresh slices of avocado- I prefer to add protein to mine, either Kalbi or Asada. At $3.50/ea I thought the tacos were just okay, heads up that the fish taco includes a wasabi sour cream whose flavor took me a bit by surprise. Most orders are served with a small side of fresh tortilla chips, which is much appreciated over the whole basket served elsewhere, that I always overdo and regret. 

Attention to detail is a theme here. Even if you dine outside, staff will come out to check on you throughout your meal. The salsas are kept fresh and cool inside a mini-fridge rather than open and exposed on a traditional salsa bar. Don't forget the aguas frescas! Next time, I'm definitely getting an extra one to go."}
{"text":"Great food and the catering was in abundance!  If you like fresh, Me Gusta nails it!  Wonderful food and service.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"They should warn people about the hot sauce. Our Korean Kalbi tacos and Pork Belly taco were so good. Got to try the Bavarian churros too."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp burrito. I have had it twice now and it was consistent with flavor and chunks of fresh shrimp."}
{"text":"\"I like tacos...\" - George W. Bush

The short and sweet of it...Me Gusta Tacos serve really delicious street style tacos and burritos.
Tried the Carnitas, the Carne Asada, and the Korean Kalbi Tacos (with corn tortillas)...all outstanding. Wife had the fish and the chicken tacos (with flour tortillas), she loved them. Also, ordered the stacked tots...tator-tots topped with melted cheese, sour crema, and a scoop of guacamole, wuz the best thing ever! Oh wait, the Bavarian cream churros wuz the best! They have freshly made juices and lemonades...strawberry-lemonade was very thirst quenching...and they also have some Mexican beers on tap. And oh yeah, salsa's located in a refrigerator up front...Legit tacos, bomb tots, churros, give it a try."}
{"text":"Overall, it was good! Flavors were good, portion size and cost was reasonable. Unexpected gem in this little strip mall... especially all the restaurants before didn't do well.

Tried: galbi taco, carne asada taco, and the banhmi taco. My favorite was probably the galbi. It had the most flavor, and good balance of meat, sweetness and slaw. The banhmi tasted more like a bulgogi taco than it did banhmi, but good nonetheless.

Also tasted the black bean salad. It was good, but after a few bites of it, didn't care for it as much. Maybe good to share when eating tacos...

Would definitely recommend... especially for those looking for a quick bite... and good flavor in the Southwest area."}
{"text":"This place is very aesthetically pleasing to me! Clean, bright & simple :) I have been here twice now and got the same thing both times... the bowl and added chicken. The portion size is massive for the price. They have three different salsas you can add to your meals too, ranging from mild to verrrry spicy. The agua frescas are a must try! Strawberry lemonade is the perfect balance of sweet & sour. The employees are friendly & helpful. We lucked out with a coupon in a local vegas magazine for buy one entree get one free! Next time I will definitely try the tacos!"}
{"text":"My third favorite taco stop after tacos El Gordo and Tacos and Beer. Their Korean beef taco is a touch sweet and the meat is never over cooked. The fish taco is also amazing and not heavy at all, fresh citrusy fish and a hint of horseradish. Now I don't like horseradish normally, but for some reason the small amount works well. Burritos are also pretty good. If I'm feeling like I want cheat, their burrito with the tater tots is dammmmn good. 

The only thing I don't care for is their salsas, the seem watery and I think they are made with juice which makes them too sweet and throws me off. 

They deliver on Uber Eats so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"The tacos are sooo good. I got the charbroiled carne asada, korean kalbi, and carnitas. It's gets you hella full as well"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. I found this place on Instagram, the food looked so good in photos so I decided to come give it a try. Came here for dinner and there was not one single person eating in there. I tried their fish tacos, korean kalbi tacos and carne asada tacos. Now, keep in mind that I'm a bit picky with my meat. I did not like their meat at all, they contained a \"stinky\" smell, I believe their meat wasn't fresh at all which is why they carried that funky smell. The meal was also kind of cold when it was served to us. 

I definitely had high expection for the korean kalbi and it tasted just as disappointing as the carne asada. The fish taco wasn't too bad but it was cold. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Go to Tacos el Gordo or Taco y Taco, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ordered the pollo tacos right before closing (close at 6 on Sunday's) and am still sitting outside enjoying the scenery.  Everything was very fresh and the perfect amount.  The tacos are tiny, so I ordered 3 for $9.50.  Mine came with chicken, avocado, pico & cheese; simple & perfect.

The tables for the restaurant are surrounding the splash pad, so it's perfect for me to grab a bite while the little one plays.

Excited to try the bowls and carne asada... I'll prob eat here every weekend, considering the District is my second home."}
{"text":"Stopped by while walking through the district and found this wonderful gem. The menu is simple, but more than enough options. The food is clean, fresh and not too expensive. It is the same price as Chipotle but Me Gusta tacos comes with chips. Highly recommend trying the strawberry lemonade. 

I got the shrimp burrito, my boyfriend got the mission. The food came out very fast. You can choose your own salsa, it comes in little bottles that you can bring to your table."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to taco shop. I really believed all tacos were created equal. Fortunately not! The tacos here are amazing. 

My munchies haul consisted of...
Pulled pork tator tots
Kalbi beef California burrito 
Kalbi beef tacos
Fish taco
Cream and caramel churro 

The stacked tator tots, were nothing short of heaven in every bite. The ratio of meat : tots, was a match made in heaven. Crunchiness consisted in every bite, and the flavor of the pulled pork compliments every bite so well! After this appetizer, I was ready to snack on the Kalbi California burrito. 

The first bite of the burrito, I was completely in heaven. The kalbi beef is marinated to perfection and cooked the best way possible. It pairs with the potatoes and cheese in the burrito so well. Hands down one of the best, California burritos ever."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good. The barbacoa is a little messy, so grab extra napkins. Tacos come with some chips, but I'd order more since they're so good and you can add a side of fresh guacamole for extra. 

The agua fresca is good, I prefer the strawberry lemonade. It tastes fresh and made from real fruit. Very refreshing. 

The shrimp ceviche is really good. Good to share for an appetizer for two. 

Churros are delicious and warm. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yum! I had the Mission burrito with carne asada. The food was good and fresh and the service was fast and friendly! I will definitely go back there! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Also I really appreciate them saying they are semi authentic Mexican food, honesty is important you know? 
Walking in, the establishment is clean and bright with a flair of green decor and with plenty of space! 

We were greeted and offered to try their agua fresca right off the bat, yes please! They had four flavors to choose from: pinapple basil, hibiscus, pepperment horchata, and watermelon. The drinks vary each day though.
I ended up picking the pinapple basil flavor for its refreshing yet mildly sweet taste.

I had the 3 tacos for 9.50, and it did not disappoint! One thing I noticed is that the menu incorporates Asian food, I was so excited to try their \"kind of\" fusion menu at that point. The three tacos I selected was the korean kalbi, pork belly banh mi, and carnitas.
The kalbi taco was my favorite, they marinated that beef with the best sweet flavor you can imagine. There is a generous portion too! It actually spilled out for me, but I didn't mind picking the spilt goods with my chips.
The pork belly banh mi taco definitely tasted like traditional banh mi sandwhich, minus the baguette and pate paste. The pork belly went well with the white radish/daikon and pickled carrots.
Now the carnitas, very tender and tasty! Not the best carnitas I've had, but it'll do.

You can also pick your sauces in the back left hand side. They come is squirt bottle, and there's enough for everyone! You can pick between salsa roja (spicy level 4), salsa verde (spicy level 6), and the salsa habanero (spicy level 9). The roja and verde salsa was not spicy at all to me, so it's perfect if you're not all about that spice. But the habanero kicked a good punch in terms of flavor and spice!

I liked how the staff came to check on us, asking if the food was alright. Keep it up! I can't wait to come back to try all the other tacos, and give a go at their churros... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos were delicious.  Sooooo tender. The kalbi beef tacos were good as well.  I enjoy the healthy, clean alternative to eating tacos.  Try the refreshing infused drinks like the lemon & chia."}
{"text":"Seemingly simple but bursting with flavor!

You walk into a cozy place that doesn't have all of the chaos and 30 page menu.  Nope.  A clean, plain and simple dining room just awaiting your arrival.  The service is served up with courtesy and kindness.  They definitely knew how to focus on their customers and give them an enjoyable meal.  

Now usually when I eat Mexican food I need to be 'rolled' out of the restaurant from being so stuffed.  Here the portions are a good amount but not heaping.  That's great for me.  I ordered the Kalbi Mission Burrito.  It's served with a few tortilla chips on the side.  Me Encanto! The kalbi had a terrific flavor with every bite.  The meat was tender and abundant throughout the burrito.  

The salsas they offer are in the little refrigerator on the condiment counter.  They were good but not great. A little too watery for my preference.  The spicy salsa could have been a little more spicy as well.  Good thing my burrito didn't need it.  

I'm glad a fresh and flavorful Mexican place has arrived.  I hope you enjoy the same great experience I did."}
{"text":"Simply awesome! You'll love Me Gusta Tacos twist on food and drinks they have to offer here.

The tacos - choice of pork, steak, fish, shredded chicken and even Kalbi!  Buy them individually 3.50 ea or mix em up a trio for under ten bucks!  Love that corn tortillas are made in house every morning.  

While I love traditional style tacos drowned in sauces and cheeses it's a welcome change of healthy and cleaner eats you'll love here. Fresh ingredients, colorful veggies, herbs  grains, and spices  that add great flavor!

My favorite go to is the Me Gusta Bowl! Quinoa,roasted corn, fresh mango dressing, some of the main ingredients make up this delicious meal. I added Kalbi bbq to mine.  The serving size portion is pretty filling.  Enough for sharing or leftovers if it's for yourself.. more for me, since my fam and friends turn up their noses at quinoa.. I don't know why.. it's an awesome grain, good texture, gluten free, a super food!

Stacked Tater Tots rock!  Topped with your choice protein, and you're set!

There's also kids meals! AND Breakfast items that's available all day! 

Agua Frescas!! Mucho yummo! Fresh fruits.. herbs.. ie watermelon Mint, Hibiscus, lemonade Chia are some of the drinks that the owner let us sample

... oh speaking of owner(s) familiar faces.. it's restauranters Chris (former Rachel's Kitchen) and Li (Crepe Shack Waffles)They both sold their places and they are the ones behind the creative concept and own Me Gusta Tacos! That explains the healthier creativity!

The staff here rocks as well. Most already well experienced.  You may recognize some of their smiling faces. (Hi Vinny! of B&B) 

Fast/Casual style Order at counter. Menu on the wall or grab a paper menu. Servers will bring out your orders. Help yourself to the salsas in the cooler on the counter. 
 
The space at Me Gusta occupies, was the former froyo shop here at The District at Green Valley Ranch.  Transformation to this fast casual café is pretty impressive. Small, but spacious enough for hightops and table seating inside.  Seating also right out front with hightops or chill with the tables in the common area in front of the splash pad.

Reasonable and pretty affordable, they strive for high quality...It just got even cooler hanging out here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Get something with Kalbi (Korean beef). I got Kalbi nachos and the hubs was jealous of my order even though his shredded chicken tacos were extremely fresh!"}
{"text":"5 STARS! I'm from San Diego, I'm 6'3\", 300 pounds! I know Mexican food! This place BLEW MY MIND! Breakfast burritos, Kalbi tacos, Kalbi tater tots!!!! This spot does it right. The salsa is on point, but be careful of that Habanero salsa...so much citrus that the heat sneaks right up on you!!!! Chris, one of the owners, was epic, knowledge, and most importantly, friendly! This is a spot I will stop at every single time I'm in Vegas! GO THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"Cute little taco shop located in The District in Green Valley. The restaurant itself is small but there is seating right outside in a courtyard, because for the fall. Their menu has a little Asian twist to them. We got the pork belly burrito which is the best burrito I've tasted. The other burrito we got was the kalbi burrito which also was delicious and full of flavor. We did a mix of three tacos, kalbi and pork belly mix, the flavors were perfect. They also have house made hot sauce. If you check in you get a Agua Fresca! Will definitely be back if I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were just strolling down the District to find somewhere to eat and we stumbled upon me Gusta. I'm always hesitant with taco spots, we don't like really fancy high end tacos. They usually are over priced and not very good. This taco spot has a fusion twist to it, kalbi and pork belly... need I say more? They had me at pork belly! I originally ordered three tacos with a mix of kabli and the other two pork belly. The pork belly was nice and thick and very flavorful. the pork belly tacos were so good I went back and got a pork belly burrito. I love the twists with fusion cuisine. They offer free Fresca upon yelp check in and home made hot sauces! If I'm in the area I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are a must when going to Me gusta tacos! So happy I decided to stop in. Will recommend to all my clients, friends, and family."}
{"text":"Pretty decent americanized mexican food. Sisters and I tried the carne asada mission burrito, one of the breakfast burritos, chicken taco, and korean taco. Ingredients taste fresh, but doesnt taste much different from say Chipotle. The tacos were good but nothing special. Mission burrito was the best item and had seasoning that reminded me of Indian food. The steak in the breakfast burrito was very bland though. Food does have good size portions and come with free chips. The agua frescas were really delicious and refreshing. The girl at the register was very friendly and food came out super fast. I would give 5 stars for price, but food just isnt stand out. You also have to pay for $2 for refills, but hey youre in Henderson. Dont think I would come again unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"The pineapple basil juice is amazing. I also enjoyed the camitas and carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location every one is very sweet. 
It's convenient to order to go usually take 5 to 10 minutes. 
The food is delicious and they have lots of options. 
Coffee is great too."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before I saw the sign. Ordered from Uber Eats and the food was delicious.  Had a black bean and cheese burrito and a chicken taco. Both really good. The taco was full of meat and it was juicy and not dried out. I will say the taco was like a street taco and since it was so full it could have used a double shell but still delicious. 
The burrito was fantastic and cheesy. The chips were crisp and light perfect! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews on this place and had seen it at The District a few times so we decided to try it.  I thought it was pretty good, not amazing or anything, but pretty good.

We had two different types of Nachos, chicken and carne asada. The chicken was better in my opinion.  Also, had the me gusta bowl and the California burrito with carnitas. Out of all of them, the California burrito was the best, a good ratio of ingredients.

Overall, i'd recommend it. The staff was very friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! A little on the pricey side, but considering they are on the gourmet side of the taco spectrum it was pretty worth it. Quaint little seating area, the food came out fast and the service was good. They have a few beers and wines on tap too which is awesome! I tried the chicken, Barbacoa and steak tacos. Giving it 4 stars only because the barbacoa taco was pretty greasy and caused my other two tacos to get kinda soggy :/ other than that, the tacos are delicious and the salsa is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Korean Kalbi tacos which are made with marinated Korean Flap Steak & Asian cabbage slaw & a Strawberry Lemonade. The owner Li also gave me a sample of Pineapple Basil drink. It was good, with a green grassy fruit flavor & would be perfect for people that like Basil.
I thought the Korean Kalbi Tacos were delicious. 2 of them were perfect for lunch.  I got them with soft corn tortillas. 
The Agua Fresca Strawberry Lemonade was refreshing & not too sweet.
For desert I had a Cinnamon Sugar Churros & a Caramel Churros with a Hibiscus flavored Sangria. The Caramel Churros has a creamy center which was yummy. Both Churros were freshly made, nice & hot. The Hibiscus Sangria hit the spot!
Service was good. The 2 counter people smiled & were very attentive. And the owner Li was also nice. The restaurant was clean. I do recommend it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I REALLY REALLY did!! Unfortunately I did not. My husband on the other hand did thoroughly enjoy his meal. 
I liked their chips and guacamole though. Very tasty. For some odd reason my taste buds were just not into it. 
I will however try again!!"}
{"text":"Tacos please me, but so do taquitos- and MGT's Cinco de Mayo taquito special is what brought me clear across town to this location! Hopefully they'll eventually add this as a full time menu staple, because the rolled tacos topped with cheese, sour cream, and guac was tasty and a good portion for the price. Staff were friendly even when I barged in the minute they opened. Don't forget to snap a photo with the taco mirror, raid the salsa fridge, and check in on your Yelp app for a free agua fresca!"}
{"text":"The guy at the counter was very nice and helpful. They have a few vegetarian options and I opted for the me Gusta bowl without any meat. The food was good but it felt like it was missing something. It definitely wasn't meant to be a vegetarian bowl or else there would be more ingredients in it. The mango dressing however was very tasty and so was their salsa so I'll give them that. Overrall I got a very good impression of the place and next time I will try the vegetarian burrito or taco"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The watermelon mint water is a little piece of heaven on earth... The friendly and welcoming staff that explained the items on the menu, from the fresh shells, gmo free meat. The fish taco with the fresh cod is a breath of fresh air... From service, quality & price I will for sure to come back! Definitely a place to check out if your shopping in the district"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the district and Green Valley! Loved the Tacos, the Nachos and the Quinoa bowl. Super cute and clean, great vibe and excellent service!"}
{"text":"¡Me gusta Me Gusta Tacos! Thank God a place like this opened in The District, it was much needed! With a perfect location and amazing atmosphere, Me Gusta Tacos is bound to do well. Their food is exceptionally fresh and delicious and the owner is friendly and present. 

We ordered the Black Bean Bowl, three tacos (Carne Asada, Korean Kalbi, and Carnitas), a side of guacamole, and the Hibiscus Agua Fresca. I wasn't mad at any of it. The food was fresh and simple, which the wall graphic reiterates inside the restaurant. The black bean bowl was perfectly balanced ingredient-wise and exactly what I want from a lunch dish. Light, filling, and scrumptious. Now, the tacos, I'm not a huge meat eater, but I tried each one of the tacos and dang, is that meat amazing! The flavor was fantastic and the quality was high. No fatty parts. I was majorly impressed. Especially with the Carne Asada. It was charred perfectly. Something this place also does well, they use ripe avocados! Nutty and delicious without a hint of the fruity flavor that an overripe avocado possesses. 

I'm very excited about this place. They have beer, wine, sangria, and mimosas (on the weekends). You can grab a glass of sangria, sit on the patio and watch your kids play on the splash pad. Or, if you don't have kids like me, watch parents watching their kids on the splash pad, feeling grateful that it's not you."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Love that there are vegan options! Black bean salad is phenomenal! Get the Anthem burrito, hold the cheese, perfect! For the kiddos I get sides of guac, black beans and rice and a couple tortillas and they make their own burritos! Total win... and I get to sip a beer while they splash in the splash pad between bites!"}
{"text":"Ordered Uber Delivery- Presentation & packaging was nice. Looked really good, but very disappointed on the prices.  

Ordered the following:

Anthem Burrito $8.50- By the time you add a protein $3.00, Avocado $.75, Pico $.50, Sour Cream $.50, black beans $1.00, Spanish Rice $1.50= your burrito ends up being $15.75

Bean & Cheese burrito- Will not order again
Roasted Corn with Bacon- Yummy
Mission Burrito- Will not order again. Tastes exactly like the Anthem
Charbroiled Carne Asada Taco- Both tacos were together in same packaging and tasted exactly the same. 
Barbacoa Taco- Both tacos were together in same packaging and tasted exactly the same. 

I am giving a 2 based on the price. My total was $58.00. I could have spent $12 at taco bell and received the same tasting items."}
{"text":"Wow! These tacos are the best!!! The ingredients were super fresh. Agua Fresca is the best I've ever had. Also if you prefer black beans over pinto, this is definitely the place to visit."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a bunch of friends. The food was great and the customer service is just as good. I don't usually write reviews here on yelp expect when I encounter a place with good food and excellent service. Highly, highly recommend this place. 

To the staff: keep up the great service!!! It make all the difference."}
{"text":"Kicking myself for not trying this place sooner-it's so close to home! The Black Bean salad just blew my mind. Love the proportions: equal parts of all ingredients, instead of being romaine-centric, and the cilantro lime dressing is stupid good. No, it's not authentic Mexican, they themselves call it \"semi-authentic.\" It's just fresh, clean, simple and delicious. Can't wait to try more, but I'm pretty certain I've already landed on my favorite dish."}
{"text":"I would stumble in here every now and again for tacos and decided to have them cater our wedding. 100% A+ maximum awesomeness. All of our guests were fed, they kept the food stocked the line moving and helped our guests. Their service and food is always good (hence us using them for our wedding) but then coming through so clutch on a catering order for a big life event was enough to keep me a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito place. Tried the steak and egg burrito on my second visit-very good. I enjoyed the tater totes as well. This is a new restaurant worth trying out. My daughter loved her quesadilla"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The servers are really friendly. I recommend this place with two thumbs up. I ordered the California burrito and let me tell you. One of the best burritos I have ever had. I do wish they would have salt available for the triangle tostada's but healthy right ? Lol try the pineapple basil. You will get a second cup for sure !!!!!"}
{"text":"Very bland and over priced for chicken tacos. I was excited to try this place but my boyfriend and were pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"PORK BELLY BANH MI TACOS. YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES. Great prices for great food. Their salsa is amazing. I will say tho if you are craving authentic Mexican tacos, Taco y Taco is the spot to be. This is more of a specialty craving if that makes sense - but maybe I'm only saying that because I've only had the kalbi mission burrito and pork belly banh mi tacos. Very fresh tasting, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already. Both times I ordered to-go. I've had the carnitas, pork belly, barbacoa, Korean kalbi, carne asada, and fish tacos. I also like to get the tator tots (comes with sour cream, cheese, and a big scoop of guacamole). I highly recommend this place and will be back to try the rest of the menu! I have my eye on the churros next!"}
{"text":"Me Gusta is a unique version of the classic taco shop and perfect for the Green Valley District vibe. They have all the classic Mexican flavors you'd expect, but done a little more refined and with attention to detail that can sometimes slip through the cracks at a \"standard\" taqueria. They also have some interesting fusion tacos that can't be missed- the Korean Kalbi BBQ is out of this world flavorful and a perfect marriage of the two cuisines! 

The only thing that holds these tacos back from a perfect five stars is the tortilla; they are wonderfully fresh, loaded with filling, but often fall apart as a result while eating and that's a bummer. I also would like to see a bit more variety in their salsa selection. They have three options, all very tasty, but two are pretty similar in my opinion and the third is good- but it is SPICY! I can handle a decent amount of heat and it gets me sometimes. It would be nice if they had a more middle of the road salsa (heat wise) as the two similar salsas are more mild, but differ in flavor/texture a bit."}
{"text":"Some of the greatest tacos I've had yet! We took them to go and they were still delicious. The guacamole was phenomenal. You have to try the bean salad! I had asada tacos and my girlfriend ordered pollo tacos. Both were 5-star worthy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my New Mexican spot my favorite! Except they run out of my basil cucumber water when I went there last. I was bummed out but other than that it would have been 6 stars haha. It's amazing food, not greasy at all. Good quality Mexican food. My favorite is their chicken taco and charred carne Asadas."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Henderson and I always want to try Mexican food when I'm in NV.  We got 3 sets of taco meals. And one nachos with pollo. 
Everything was fresh and flavorful. The salsas were all great!  The habanero one (yellow) was sweet and really spicy.  My mouth was burning but I couldn't stop eating it, was so good.  
The ceviche was a great suggestion to eat with our chips and the two Aqua fresca's were delicious!  We got take out, but I loved seeing Malbec as a wine choice!  
We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The customer service at this restaurant was amazing. Thank you Francis for going above and beyond in every way. I will definitely be back again! 

I ordered the breakfast burrito, but instead of cilantro, I got avocado. It tasted pretty good with their most mild red salsa. Next time I'm looking forward to trying their shrimp burrito. I was able to try their caramel and cream churros. I liked the cream one better."}
{"text":"Great location!  Service was on point.  Quality of food is noticeable on your 1st bite...to the last.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Kalbi taco was delish.  The fish taco was good.  The balbacoa taco...not so much.  The spicy breakfast burrito w bacon did not have much bacon...just a lot of tadteless, rubbery, liquid eggs.  The saving grace was the habanero (really hot) salsa and the salsa verde.  The basil drink was interesting and good."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times now as it's usually the go-to eatery in The District,  mainly for being convenient and somewhat decently priced. 
The menu looks fun while there aren't too many options which is okay, but the flavors are just okay too good, nothing to fall in love with. 
I'm a huge fan of tacos and the tacos here usually fall apart and for some reason the flavors don't come together that well. 
It's also REALLY bright in here so not really a night time vibe or relaxing loungey vibe...
The things I do like are that it's fast, reasonably healthy, and they have beer. There are some stools you can sit and eat at and watch the passers by. 
When I'm @ The District I usually eat here or @ Crazy Pita, which is also good
but not great. Everything else is too trendy or overpriced."}
{"text":"Good for lunch. My husband liked the carnitas taco and I had a burrito. We liked their green salsa the best and we both got free aguas frescas for checking in. We had the strawberry lemonade. The orange pineapple was also delicious. We tried the caramel and the Bavarian cream churros. The caramel one tasted artificial but the other was good!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is a new hidden gem!I tried the Korean taco and it's on point for sure.The staff was knowledgeable and very nice.The choice of fresh salsa was really fun and I like the selfie mirror lol"}
{"text":"Great food and the best aqua fresca!!!! LoVe the barbacoa and korean beef. The sayces are aoooo good too!!"}
{"text":"What I love most about Me Gusta Tacos is the care they put into making each dish. Some places just pile massive gobs of ingredients into a tortilla and call it a day. Here, they construct dishes carefully and everything is perfectly balanced. The food is fresh and great quality. And service is fantastic. I've had almost everything on the menu and haven't found anything I haven't loved. Faves: mission burrito, tacos - kalbi, fish, asada, agua frescas, and their churros."}
{"text":"Such a breath of fresh air. The flavors are unique, great quality, excellent service. You can tell each meal is made with care. I'm a big fan of the mission burrito with carne asada, fish taco, and kalbi taco. They also have interesting agua frescas you must try."}
{"text":"Saw some great reviews from fellow yelpers so I came in for some breakfast burritos when I was visiting Vegas. I think I really enjoyed it because of their fresh ingredients and creative flavors!"}
{"text":"Not good. Fish taco was raw and cold inside. Carne Asada taco was mushy. Carnitas taco was okay. Salsa verde was decent, but I couldn't get past the one bite of the cold, raw fish taco."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Sides are all sold separately, paid about 30.00 for about 20.00 worth of food..will not go back."}
{"text":"Color me impressed. After having a so-so experience at a few taco shops on SW side of LV, we gave this one a shot. The place is bright, clean, & simple. They offered samples of the aqua frescas as we walked in. The hibiscus  was good but the cantaloupe was calling my name. It was refreshing and a delicious compliment to the habanero salsa. We ordered 2 plates of 3 tacos & it comes with chips. The chips are comparable to Chipotle & just as good. We went classic on my son's tacos & more adventurous on mine. They were all very tasty! Our least favorite was the vegetarian & barbacoa. Originally from South Texas, we do barbacoa very well. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't comparable. The vegetarian made for a great salsa for my chips after adding the habanero salsa. It was stuffed with the tiny cut veggies. Very pretty and colorful-the standouts were just so phenomenal! Our favorites-the Korean kalbi (never had before so can't compare it), the delicious roasted corn with bacon (a side you MUST get), & the Pork Belly Banh Mi.  OMG!!! I love the flavor of pork belly but can't stand the thick pieces of fat. This was cooked so beautifully that you get the flavor of the pork with a few crispy edges, minus chewy fat. Wow! The banh mi vegetables tame any taste of fat with their crisp, tangy accent. I highly suggest!!! I usually judge a taco joint by their salsas. I didn't even let a drop touch my 1st two favorite tacos! That's saying a lot for this Texas girl! We loved this place."}
{"text":"Simple effective menu. Excellent fresh tacos. Great affordable option at the District ."}
{"text":"Cruising by and happened to stop in. It exceeded all of my expectations. The space is clean and comfortable. Service is really nice and helpful. The tacos are fantastic and possibly some of the best I've had in Las Vegas so far. The ingredients are obviously high quality. The menu has a good mix of traditional and innovative flavors. Definitely coming back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Wow!  Awesome tacos.  All the taco choices were great.  Service was perfect. Very friendly.  Green salsa...YUM!  So happy to have them in the area!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with some out of town visitors. Tried the Me Gusta Bowl with kalbi and it was surprisingly refreshing and tasty.  I was hoping for a more flavorful dressing but I actually ended up having it without. They had the trio of fish, carne asada, and kalbi. Their least favorite was the fish but they liked the other two. Unique twist on street tacos."}
{"text":"Just wanted to shout out Me Gusta Tacos because I ordered from here to cater a party and the food was amazing! Everything came on time and the staff is so helpful and awesome. Thanks y'all for making the catering so easy!   can't wait for our next event to order again."}
{"text":"Food was okay nothing special for the price. The steak felt like it was beef not carne asada (don't know how to explain this any better).  

That loaded tots were good. I'll go back but no rush. 

Service was good and overall food was good not great. Very clean. The Fresca was good also. Not 5 star for steak being subpar"}
{"text":"Meh, they were OK. I ordered 3 tacos and a drink. The counter employee was kind and friendly. My order came out VERY quick. The taste of the tacos is where the 3 stars falls into play. I ordered a carnitas, a barbacoa and a kalbi taco. The carnitas and barbacoa weren't special in any way. The carnitas taco lacked any flavor at all and the barbacoa was similar. The kalbi taco had a flavor explosion! Yummy! If I return, that will be my \" go-to\". Chips were good, salsas were very good too. Tortillas were soft, needed a little crunch to them."}
{"text":"I was in Taco Monday kind of mood and always had Me Gusta Tacos on my radar. So decided to stop by for lunch get my tacos on.

I ended up getting one each of the Pork Belly Banh Me, Korean Kalbi, and Fish Taco. The Pork Belly was cooked to perfection combine it with Veitnamese Slaw perfect marriage. The Korean Kalbi another favorite the meat cook on point with nice flavor (I could have had just the kalbi action by itself and be happy) and again Asian Cabbage Slaw so good. Just fan of nice slaw compliment protein brings true taco to another level. The Fish taco  just might have been my favorite if had pick on of the three. You get a nice piece of fish again cooked on point. The wasabi creme gives it different twist then normal fish taco. The warm Tortillas chips come with is hell of addicting. 

The house salsa they have three different ones from Roja, Verde, and Habanero. The Habanero warning it legit HOT!  I know with heat and salsa every restaurant different. It up there for my experience comes to the hottest salsa ever tasted. All you need is couple drops good. The Roja is very mild but nice depth of flavor. The Verde had nice balance between the two. They keep them all in squeeze bottle in little refrigerator. I thought that was pretty cool. Not like salsa station fill up cups. They had ample amount of bottles. In the bottle perfect way get even salsa across your taco. 

Don't forget use your yelp check in. I forgot so never tried the Agua Fresca. 

The restaurant I like the interior very spacious, clean, and great place to hang out with friends. I plan on coming back cause the menu has a nice diversity from Burritos, Bowls, Sides, and Churros section that sounds hell of good. Till next visit............"}
{"text":"You cannot argue that this is the BEST Mexican food in Las Vegas/Henderson area. The food is so good it's like my Gma's kitchen 20 years ago. Def come here. My girl and I will be here many times."}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night snack and was fortunate to find Me Gusta Taco still open. It was about 8:45pm. We order tacos and drinks. The service was excellent and quick. Food delicious. Highly recommend ordering their pork belly taco with pickled vegetables- the best. I also enjoyed the kalbi taco. I'll definitely come again for a full meal."}
{"text":"ME GUSTA ME GUSTA TACOS!

Some people may point out that Me Gusta Tacos is not authentic Mexican food. This is true, but that it does not sway you from experiencing these deliciousness tacos. I ordered the 3 tacos for $10 deal. They have a great variety to choose from; a more traditional choice like carnitas to a fun, fusion choice like the Korean kalbi. I decided on the pork belly banh mi, the carne asada, and the kalbi. They were all delicious! It was a close race but I have to say that I enjoyed the banh mi the most-- what a mouth watering combination with those pickled veggies and the cilantro! UMF. I also had a bite of the California burrito ($9). Instead of usual fries you find in a cali burrito they use tots which is fine with me. The tacos and the burritos are served with non-GMO tortilla chips (oh hey, fancy now). 

When you dine in, you can go to the little fridge off to the side to pick up your own salsa bottles. There are three different kinds to make sure that everyone in your group is happy. Talking about things that make me happy-- they also serve breakfast all day long! I know I can't speak for everyone, but I can have a breakfast burrito ANY time of the day and my tummy will be happy! The next time I'll have to try the side order of corn. I love me some elote!

They serve agua frescas ($4) here. During my visit they had pineapple, watermelon, hibiscus, and strawberry lemonade. Make sure you use that Yelp check in for a free agua fresca with your meal. Sofa, beer, and wine are also options on the menu. 

And you can't leave this place without trying a churro ($3)! They have cinnamon sugar, Bavarian cream, and caramel. These are filled churros. For the sake of trying something different, we went with the Bavarian cream and the caramel. My favorite of the two would have to be the Bavarian cream-- it was like a churro and a donut had a baby. The caramel one was alright, but it was a little too sweet for my liking.

Also note that this place has great service! The guy that helped take our order was friendly and even offered us samples to help with that important decision making. The food came quickly and he even made a trip to our table to help clean up our table and throw away the trash. 

To end this review with a \"I'll be back\" would be an understatement. I'll be a weekly regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Can we taco'bout how great the salsas are?????  I suppose the tacos are supposed to steal the show here, but me gusta las salsas more!!!  You can tell they are freshly made and stored in a little salsa fridge.  The salsa verde is my fave; watch out for the habanero salsa!  It is spicy and will have you saying, \"haba haba,\" while trying to feel your taste buds again and breaking into a spicy sweat.  Don't fear though, the bomb agua fresca comes to the rescue!  I tried the pineapple basil one and it was so refreshing!  Kinda like a mojito sans the rum.  Oh and the steak and eggs burrito....yyyyeeesss, any day!! Steak cooked just right and fluffy eggs wrapped in a crisp yet chewy flour tortilla!!!  Soooo, come find your me gusta here~~~"}
{"text":"Spin 8 times and point to the menu and you will literally have a food-gasm. ITS THAT GOOD
Everything is amazing. If you have a chance speak to the owner Chris, he is a cool dude"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch. The workers there are extremely friendly.

I have tried their burritos(skinny) with shrimp and beef. They give a healthy portion of shrimp and beef, so I got full with alot of rice left over. The shrimp is amazing, it's grilled to perfection.

I have also tried two of their tacos. The kalbi beef  tasted a bit weird to me. I wasn't really a big fan of the Korean fusion taco. The charbroiled beef taco was pretty good. Again, I was surprised by how much meat they put inside the taco.

It's a good place to go to full your taco craving :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to the one at The District for a while and love it. So I was excited when I saw one closer to my house. It's larger, more seating, but has the same general look and feel. 

The entire family likes coming here, meaning even my super picky 11 year old. The food is always fresh and good. It's not traditional Mexican food, which is a nice change from what you usually find around.  

My favorite item is actually a bean salad with carne asada. The tacos can be ordered individually or three, and you can pick a different meat for each one if you want. My other favorite item is the roasted corn, that comes with bacon and cotija cheese on top. 

They have four different \"juices\" that change regularly. I like the basil pineapple and usually stick with that one. I tried the peppermint horchata and it wasn't bad, but not for me. Those two flavors just weren't meant to be together in my opinion. 

I think they are reasonably priced for eating out and getting really good fresh food quickly. Probably $8-12/per person. Go. You'll like it. And try the salad at this taco place."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago and I must say I was really impressed. Great atmosphere and the service was excellent via Travis, HE WAS AWESOME!!! Highly recommend both carne asada and chicken tacos. Great service and food equals a happy customer."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I ordered steak ontop of tator tots (cant remember the name of the dish). The steak was so tough and i swear it had cinnimon on it. Overpriced as well"}
{"text":"Now this place is all about location location location. The tacos are flavorful the chirps are hot and it's next to a splash pad for kids entertainment. Fun fun oh and did I mention sangria??"}
{"text":"I tried 3 tacos,chix and pork was dry, sauces and chips were salty! The drinks were on point! Overall I was expecting much more after reading all the reviews!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I ordered the chicken tacos, with corn instead of the Pico de gallo (i just dont like pico). 
I'd definitely recommend. Also, if you check-in, you get a free Agua Fresca, they had Pineapple Basil, Strawberry Lemonade, and Cantaloupe. I had the Strawberry Lemonade and it was super tart and delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   I ordered the California burrito with barbacoa because it includes tater tots.  The meat was juicy and and there was a nice crunch from the tater tots. They are generous with the cheese.

The burritos are large and come with a side of chips, cost $9.50.  The green sauce is amazing!  

The restaurant is easy to miss because of limited signage, but we'll worth the search.  I don't classify if as a fast food joint, but more of a quick service like Qdoba."}
{"text":"Te gustan tacos? Me gusta tacos! Well, their burritos are better in my opinion! Their california burrito is my favorite :) I love how they added tater tots instead of fries. It makes it so filling! You have a choice of different meats such as: carne asada, kalbi, barbacoa, carnitas, or fish. If burritos are not your thing, they also have some tasty tacos! We ordered the shredded pollo, fish, & korean kalbi. All their fillings are a perfect pairing for the meat. There's much more on the menu but I'll let you guys have a look for yourselves when you visit. Everyone is so friendly & they have the best suggestions especially if it's your first time here!"}
{"text":"This place is great! You can taste, the fresh ingredients in every bite- right down to their homemade Salsas and Agua Frescas!! They have unique tacos, which were tasty. The Carne Asada meat was so tender!!! 

You place your order at the counter. You'll see some juices that they make in house, and can sample them! The Pineapple Basil was DELICIOUS!! But I opted for Cantaloupe juice- was so refreshing and not too sweet! 

The only reason I'm deducting a star, is because 1 taco costs $3.50. and they are small tacos. While I loved my meal, a few hours later it pissed me off just how much I ended up spending for 2 people. But I still do recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Just got Uber eats and I'm very very impressed so good and healthy, not greasy or salty!  I got the quinoa bowl add chicken. The beans were perfectly cooked. I think everywhere I go the beans are always salty- but these were not. This is my idea of mexican"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place I would go back to. I ordered the California Burrito with Kalbi. It was very delicious. I would go back and order the pork belly tacos. The Agua Fresca cantaloupe was refreshing as well. Service was great all around."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and awesome food. Their sauces aren't too spicy but they sure are tasty! Make sure to get one of their fresh juices too!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food.  Everything is homemade and very flavorful.  Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I ordered 4 tacos. Hey, I was hungry and I wanted to try a variety. But in fairness, I could have been satisfied and full off of 2 tacos. I shared with my hubby.

I ordered 2 asada, 1 banh mi, and 1 Korean bbq. The Korean bbq Taco was my fave. It was pretty poppin with memorable flavor. The banh mi was just aiight and same goes for the asada. However, props to them for the quality of the meats used, as well as how perfectly they are cooked. 

I will definitely come back to try everything else. So many Things I wanted to order all at once, but I knew I couldn't overdue it. I'll try something different next time and maybe add an extra Korean bbq Taco lol."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Found them through instagram and they didn't disappoint. We had the California burrito and their Shrimp burrito \"Make it Skinny\" style (No tortilla). Both were very tasty and nice portions.  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This place is a go-to for me. Casual. Good and consistent-- quality food, tasty, and nice customer service. Walk up service. They even feature non-gmo tortilla chips included with burritos and tacos. I usually dine here. Ordering for pick-up easy-peasy  but why waste the packaging when I'll finish my lunch in just a few. Yum. Even health conscious friends have enjoyed it.

Watch out those agua frescas - made here with fresh fruits- they are delish. I had pineapple basil today (have seen people order it with wine). So either way quite refreshing and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Me Gusta Tacos is amazing! The ingredients are fresh, the food tastes great, and the owners are really nice. I would eat here every day if I lived in the area. They have great meals that are more traditional Mexican as well as other awesome dishes that bring in new ideas and food combinations. 

You can't go wrong with anything you order here!"}
{"text":"Muy bueno is an understatement, this spot got me hooked in just one visit. The staff upfront was very friendly and gave me the scoop on the different types of tacos and burrito's. I caught the 3 tacos for 9.95 deal on the menu so that's what I got. I opted for the Carne Asada, Pollo, & to my surprise they had pork belly bahn mi (which i love ) and to have it in taco form was amazing. The 3 taco deal comes with a side of chips and there are 3 salsa variations in a fridge so whether you like mild or caliente there is a salsa for everyone. After the taco feast i inquired about the churros which are stuffed with filling. I grabbed a caramel one which was delightful and picked the brain of the guy up front on what I should try for my next visit. I got to sample the Kalbi which tasted great so that's on my radar for next time. Also interestingly enough they do serve Breakfast ALL DAY! :D, and the Breakfast burritos are calling my name for the morning. Bonus: get a free agua fresca with a yelp check in!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Excellent food. Friendly and very customer service oriented staff. Fun place for families especially with the outdoor seating and splash pad."}
{"text":"For the hype I've heard about Me Gusta Tacos, for the first impression it did not live up to the hype. I order through grub hub for lunch at work and my experience with strictly the food wasn't that well. I ordered one kalbi steak taco with the Asian slaw on the side, Mexican edamame, and a side of guacamole. For starters, they did put a small 3oz cup of the slaw on the side as well as putting it on half of the taco. I strictly ordered slaw on side but that's not what happened. I ordered the Mexican edamame and it was a stereotypical version of Mexican edamame, just tajin ontop of the edamame. I different take on it, but not to my personal liking. The kalbi taco was delicious and the guacamole was amazing as well. The food arrived warm and I would definitely like to try this place again and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars but I cannot justify pushing this to a solid 4 star review. More of that in a bit.

I came here knowing this isn't your street-style tacos you'll find at Tacos El Gordo. I've read some reviews beforehand and many of you have said it's more of a fusion kind of taco. Okay, noted.

So I ordered the three tacos for $9.50: carne asada, Korean kalbi and carnitas. We also got a California Burrito-crunchy tator tots, cheddar, sour cream with barbacoa. 
That burrito was great....lots of flavor...a lot going on with the tator tots and choice of meat. Lather that up with the green salsa and mmmm mmmm good!
My carne asada and Korean kalbi tacos were delicious. This probably would have been a 4 star review if I got those two tacos alone. But the mood killer was the carnitas taco. Plain and flavorless....no matter how much salsa I put on that thing....the taco just cannot be saved. What a shame.

Three different kind of salsas. Spice level comes in mild, medium and habanero hot. I love allllll things spicy and that was scorching hot! Be careful, it won't hit you at first so you put another layer on your food and them boom! The pain and fire in your mouth!!!!!!! Lesson learned, just go easy on that. Our fav was the green salsa; 6/10 in spice level. 

Checking in on Yelp gives you a free aqua fresca. I had the pineapple basil. Yum! One drink per party...unless you get a generous cashier like some people here, you get a free drink per guest. Didn't happen to me.

And I agree with some Yelpers...this place just isn't worth the hype. Mediocre tacos. I may give it one more shot and order their stacked tator tots."}
{"text":"The vegetarian tacos were really good. I could barely notice there was bell peppers in them and i hate bell peppers. The 3 tacos for 9.50 was pretty filling. If they added one more then you would be stuffed so maybe they should add one more haha. Churros were great!!! Had cinnamon sugar on it for days! I had the hibiscus agua fresca and it was good! Good hot sauce range! The habanero was surprisingly flavorful and not just hot! Definitely worth it to check it out. Next time I want to try the burrito!"}
{"text":"Pretty good next Mexican place. I came here after reading the reviews in yelp. Only been here once and had the chicken burrito it was solid. It's nice to have the fresh salsas, I really liked the green one, red one was not great and the habanero definitely had a kick. Only issue is I added tater tots to my burrito and I feel like it was like 2.5 more and that seems like a lot of like 5/6 tater tots."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly, and the food is fantastic!! We checked in for a free juice we chose the orange pineapple and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. Small but great menu. Fast turn around for take out orders. My go to take out place when I'm hungry and can't decide."}
{"text":"First time visiting this joint while browsing Yelp for a new place to try out. The restaurant is very clean, modern and instagram worthy at every corner. It wasn't busy when we first arrived but soon after we got our food many people started to walk in. 

My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted with friendly staff. They told us about their favorites and other items on the menu. They let us try out their Agua Fresca drink which is basically fresh fruit juice. You can get a free one when you check in on Yelp. Finally we made our selection. I ordered three tacos; two Korean Kalbi and one Vegetarian. My boyfriend ordered the California Burrito which was delicious. I liked the Kalbi Tacos because they were flavorful, juicy, and nicely portioned. The Vegetarian was lacking flavor so I wouldn't suggest that taco. Even with hot salsa. That's another thing I liked, their signature salsa. I chose the spiciest one and boy was it spicy. I am used to spice and this was delicious! Our meals also came with fresh chips which were nice and warm. It was a nice treat with our food. 

I definitely will be coming back to try more food here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! I went here last night and from the moment we walked in, the service was top notch. The cashier (i wish i would have gotten his name), was very helpful, willing to give us any suggestions and was willing to make special accommodations so i could find something i would like (i'm a vegetarian). The food was great, my mother loved the Carnitas which we found out they slow cook for SEVEN HOURS. Even their churros were the best i've had in a while. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great experience overall! I would definitely get the carnitas tacos and fish tacos again! The tater tots with carnitas on top are genius, loved them. Banh mi tacos were ok. We got the free agua Fresca with check in! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a super quick, cheap bite to eat before my meeting at Green Valley Ranch. Out of all the options available this matched the best and I couldn't be happier with the results. I had the steak and egg breakfast burrito. It came out quick and was incredibly tasty. It was served with tater tots and the overall portion was large. I was starving and couldn't finish everything. I will definitely be back to try all the other items on their menu. I love finding eateries like this!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so high, food was average. Great customer service and staff, chicken tacos were a 3/10 and my burrito was a 5ish/10. Wasn't worth the calories or price."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice now and both times were really good. The tacos are street style are really filed with stuff. The carne asada is my favorite, Tried the pork belly ban mi taco, delicious. They ague frescas they have are tasty too. Nice and friendly staff that work there too"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the customer service! You have to try the Kalibi! And the churros. So so good!"}
{"text":"I had some errands to do in Green Valley area so I stopped by this newly opened taco shop at the district that I had bookmarked a week or so ago. This place is a perfect lunch spot for health conscious people. 
I had Me Gusta Bowl with Carne Asada. This bowl came with a lot of garlic flavored lean steaks, shredded red cabbages, corns, and five thinly sliced avocados on top of generous portion quinoa. Came with green lemony, citrusy sauce on the side but I used their habanero salsa instead. It was orange flavored salsa (spice level 9). Went perfect with the Carne Asada!!
Next time, I will order this bowl without the corns. Then, it would be the perfect low carb, high protein bowl for me :-) 
I had samples of their Agua Frescas. Mmmm, sweet but very refreshing. I liked the watermelon mint flavor. All four flavors are very sweet but the sweetness is from natural fruits. They don't add sugar to their Agua Frescas. Nice. This would be a perfect refreshing drink for me after I sweat my ass off at the gym!! Can't wait. 
The service was nice and helpful.
I love this new Mexican spot. Probably the healthiest Mexican option in Henderson!! 

*(Personal note) I got garlic breath after eating this bowl.  (Very strong garlic taste in my mouth till I got home and brushed my teeth.) Next time, don't forget to bring mint gums or mint tablets."}
{"text":"Decent little gourmet taco shop at the district. Not much seating there but we like to sit outside at the splash pad and let our daughter play while we nom. bonus for having local beer on tap. tot nachos are good. kinda pricey overall but not really any more than other street taco joints. will be back once its warm enough for the splash pad again."}
{"text":"Love the twist on this taco shop. I'm Korean and I love their kalbi tacos 
The pineapple drink is very tasty-not too sweet-just right. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was overall delicious. We order 3 tacos: kalbi, carnitas, and carne. I was especially impressed with the kalbi taco! It was flavorful, juicy and the flavor combo was great. Then we order a carnitas nachos and it was meh. I wasn't impressed with the flavor at all. The nachos was bland and kinda boring, but it came with a great amount of guac. Then the owner recommended us the Me Gusta Bowl which completely surprised me. The quinoa was perfectly cooked, the mango dressing was tart and complimented the quinoa. We got it with kalbi meat and it was a great choice. I definitely recommend this Ko-Mex fusion but only on certain options!"}
{"text":"So there's got to be a dozen choices for tacos on every street corner in Vegas but if you want some of the most unique and best around then this is the place to be.

Came here on a late Thursday night right before they closed. I thought they'd be a bit in a hurry to get us out but they were so busy working on orders for pick up they didn't rush us at all.

Heard a lot of talk about this place so I wanted to try a variety. They offer tacos for $3.50 a piece of 3 for $9.50 and that comes with chips. 

I went ahead and tried the carne asada taco, fish taco and pastor(pork).

The asada taco was magnificent. Tender juicy succulent pieces of steak cooked perfectly. Grilled to the best way possible and served with onions and cilantro. A true homage to street tacos everywhere. I opted for the flour tortilla at no extra cost.

Next was the fish taco. A simply perfectly grilled piece of fish inside the flour tortilla served with a wasabi aioli and shredded cabbage with some cilantro. Very well done but I'm a fan of the Baja style where it's a chunk of white cod fried but this was exceptional by all means.

Last was the pastor. Perfectly cooked pieces of pork that had been marinated to perfection and served with a pico de gallo.

No wonder this place is so popular. Definitely a step above the rest in cleanliness and appearance. Still a simple taco shop but a safer and more inviting field."}
{"text":"What can I say? The place is clean... mininalist style. Now comes the food.... we got the california carne asada burrito and 3 tacos (barbacoa, kalbi, and pork belly). The kalbi and pork belly was great! Barbacoa on the other hand was bland and chewy. The corn tortilla breaks easily though especially it only comes with one per taco. My husband had the california burrito. He said it was kind of dry. With the price, I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Just not a FAN, have been there five times. I wish we had real mexican food with a bar in zip 89052, All way looking"}
{"text":"So I tried giving the benefit of the doubt by hoping maybe I misunderstood the type of food they serve hoping I could maybe excuse the taste in food by perhaps saying it's a mexican/korean/american/Japanese fusion. However, their website specifically states it's Mexican style food. So back to the day I went, I went hoping to have some \"Mexican style\" tacos and boy was I disappointed!!! These tacos are in no way Mexican style. I would perhaps give them a higher star review if they were a fusion since they have kalbi tacos and other different types of meats and ingredients. I also had their carne asada tacos, which were really unpleasant to my taste. My husband in his side didn't mind them but said they had no flavor. The tacos he had were barbacoa and those weren't terrible, the carnitas tasted like cinnamon in the meat, personally I did not like them and neither did he. The drinks were also disappointing in our opinion. He had peppermint orchata and it tasted more like a peppermint with water and milk. I want to stress out that my point is not to put down a business, I just simply want to express my opinion in case someone is planning on going so that they can have better understanding of what the food might be like. I hate to be the only negative review but I personally did not like it or plan to go there for Mexican style tacos. If you are into fusion food then I would definitely give it a try. Churros were good and the employees were very nice."}
{"text":"Great fusion tacos.  Tried the carnitas,barbacoa and korean kalbi.  All great.  Fresh ingredients with fast service."}
{"text":"Very plain taco shop tucked into the vons shopping center. Hardly visible from the road but if your shopping in the center you see a few signs. Very clean and neatly organized in the inside with a nice modern decor. Service was fast and cashier was friendly. I ordered 3 tacos and all 3 were okay. They did have several salsas and hot sauces which were all very good . The prices are fairly high for single tacos. Their portions are pretty small and despite their attempt at a gourmet spin on Mexican food they fall pretty short of expectation based on price. I probably won't return due to the fact the prices don't match the product."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Mexican food, especially when it's prepared with fresh ingredients made to order. NonGMO tortilla chips, a trio of salsas to choose from available at your fingertips, and refreshing agua frescas to cleanse your palate. The Mission burrito, and stacked tots are a must try. This place is located in the heart of The District of Green Valley and is great for family gatherings outside overlooking the splash pads or inside while you munch away and listen to the acoustic guitar music."}
{"text":"The atmosphere: clean, minimalistic aesthetic. Not the biggest place, but there are tables to eat at inside as well as out on the patio. 

The service: always kind and professional. 

The food: AMAZING 

Checkin perks: you get a complimentary agua fresca with your order when you checkin on Yelp. 

My favorites on the menu: Carnitas Tacos, Classic Churro, Hibiscus Agua Fresca, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE their salsa roja."}
{"text":"Pros:  Location is great with outdoor seating. The inside is small and very clean and the small fridge with your fav salsa is readily available. Service was quick and the people were very friendly. 

Cons: The corn tortillas, C'mon Man! I get those at the grocery store, same for the chips for that matter. The carnitas and the carne asana were okay but lacked some flavor. The meat was scooped out of some caldron or something and the juices just made the store bought corn tortillas fall apart.

I don't mind paying for good food but this was unacceptable. I consider myself a lifetime taco consumer and can cook a dang good taco as well. It all comes down to how much love you put into it. 

I did not feel the love in this place preparing the tacos. I may give them one more try and see if there is improvement."}
{"text":"Fusion tacos is the way to describe this restaurant. I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner to get my tacos and burritos. I am personally a really big fan of their carnitas and kalbi beef. I have tried these proteins on almost anything they offer from tacos, salads, and burritos and can't get enough! If you are looking for a place to bring the family this new location is it! The restaurant has plenty of space for large parties, it's spotless and the customer service is great. While I was having lunch here the other day I was checked on by the staff frequently and felt really cared for. 
 
This particular review is going to be on the Carne Me Gusta Bowl and pineapple basil drink I personally had. I really recommend this since it is a very healthy alternative to an actual burrito without getting the carb guilt. The bowl came with soft quinoa, crunchy cabbage, tender steak and tangy mango dressing. I added my two favorite salsa's the green and habanero for the extra spice and enjoyed every bit of this dish. When the spice would get high I would took a sip of the pineapple basil agua fresca and cooled off with this cold refreshment.  The bowl has definitely become one of my new favorites aside from the tacos of course. To top off my meal I ordered a Bavarian cream churro which was warm and fresh. I will definitely be back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Simple but very tasty.  Flavors are very well done and matched with great atmosphere at the district.  Great place to stop with the kids right by the splashpad"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I used to live in District!  It was definitely a go-to for fresh fruit waters and delicious, healthy tacos!  Their habanero salsa is FIRE!  Literally!

I'm Vietnamese and I approve of their \"Banh Mi\" taco.  The California burrito add avocado is my fiancé's favorite. They're huge, packed burritos and it comes with a side of chips to accompany the 3 salsas that are in the mini fridge.  (Must try the Habanero salsa!!!!)"}
{"text":"Best fusion tacos I have had in a long time. I had the carnitas, fish, pork belly banh mi, kalbi, and the charbroiled carne asada. A must try place. Great service and loved the habanero sauce!! The employee also table touched which was different. Definitely worth it and portion size is spot on!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of taco joints and this one isn't anything special. The kalbi taco was ok. But the rest was like going to a minor upgrade of Roberto's. Not so special at all."}
{"text":"Me gusta Me Gusta Tacos! They have a great location with indoor and outdoor seating, the owners and staff are on point, and the food is fresh and delicious. Their decor is cute and simple and their menu is the perfect size. The menu has a good variety and great ingredients without being overwhelming. Try their agua frescas: lemon chia, cucumber lime, watermelon mint, and fresh OJ. Their fresh salsas are flavorful: green, red, and habanero. We went for breakfast and tried the Venezuelan chocolate pancakes and the breakfast burrito with tots. The pancakes are decadent, yet fluffy with amazing flavor. The breakfast burrito has green chiles in it and the tots were crispy. I liked how the burrito wasn't just wrapped in an unheated tortilla. It was crisped up nice on the outside. Everything was great! Can't wait to try all the other menu options. They are located right by the splash pad at the District. Perfect to grab some food and hang out with the family."}
{"text":"Highly overrated and overpriced.

Tried the signature carne asana tacos. Back in San Diego we would call these street tacos. They were so small, good for only about 3 bites each and at $3.50 each, that's about $1 per bite! 

Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the chunks of meat had been smaller, but they were gigantic. No effort exerted to chop the meat up into proper proportions, given how small the tacos are. You have to wonder what these people are thinking.

It was $2.50 per side order of rice and beans, black beans at that, but the rice was somewhat under cooked, and stuck together in clumps.

Kudos on their homemade sauces though, that they keep in a small chiller. Good stuff, and if you like hot, their habanero sauce was exceptionally hot, yet refreshing.

May be a good value for breakfast, but I certainly would not repeat a taco meal. For $14, you can get much more food many other places."}
{"text":"In Vegas for family event and decided to grab a bite at this location. Viewed reviews and thought I'd give it a try. Much to my disappointment, this place failed to meet my expectations. Besides being a little pricey for the quality of food you get.  My chicken tacos were a little dry, lacked flavor. Coming from Cali, I expected to see a salsa bar instead you will find a small fridge that holds salsa in plastic bottles. Too bad"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my Henderson based friend, so we agreed to meet up for dinner here while my wife and I were in town.  I appreciated the simple menu.  It gave me confidence that everything we were about to order would be done well, and for the most part, it was.  We were greeted by the friendly staff who happily helped us out with all the questions we had.  They knew the menu well and were able to give us the details that we wanted.  They also offered us samples of their agua frescas which they were very proud of, though I didn't really care for them at all. 

Our food came out and it was good, but I felt that it was a little lacking in the flavor department.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, and don't get me wrong, it was a good burrito, but I really wished there was some flavor that made the burrito \"pop\".  It's had to describe, but maybe some additional seasoning or longer marinade might have helped.  I'm not a food doctor so I admit that I am not qualified to diagnose what would have gotten this burrito another star, but overall I was still very glad we came here.

As a bonus, we got a churro before leaving and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Me gusta Me Gusta Tacos! The pork belly taco is soo good! The people there are nice and attentive too. It's absolutely a new favorite spot. Plus they deliver with Uber eats!"}
{"text":"Delicious!

Great customer service. I love that the corn is GMO-free, tortillas are freshly made, and that everything is very simple. No MSG or crap, and everything tastes fresh. 

We went there for the first time and got the avocado tostada, stacked tater tots with carnitas, and the fish, carne asada and chicken tacos. 

The only thing I was indifferent about was the fish taco. Needed some salt, maybe a slaw of sorts and some avocado! It was OK. 

Tostada? I had a dream about it that night. Just avocado and radishes. I don't like radish, but I loved this tostada with some habenero salsa. 

The chicken taco was so good. Great seasoning and not greasy. 

Carne asada taco was great too - not greasy and was just nice and light and savory. 

Tater tots were exactly what I needed them to be. Not heavy, not greasy, and their carnitas is so freaking good. Guacamole on the side was yummy too 

I'd also suggest trying their flavored water. Fresh fruit and Stevia. Pineapple basil was my favorite!

I also liked that I could play in the splash pad with my son and they bring the food out to us while we play! Love it!

P.S. Everything is gluten free except the Korean taco, pancakes (I think), and the burritos (flour tortilla), and their salsas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. I had a burrito and y was delicious and we also had steak tacos which were good to. The lace was very clean and open space. You'd be able to sit inside or out if you prefer."}
{"text":"I loved the California burrito with Kalbi  seriously so tasty and meaty!! Their menu isn't huge but it's definitely worth trying. I also tried the hibiscus Fresca and all 3 salsas."}
{"text":"Just got into town and my husband wanted tacos. We found Me Gusta on here and the reviews were good so we decided to give it a try, I'm glad we did, the prices were pretty good and the carne asada tacos were delicious! We'll definitely be returning on our next trip to Henderson."}
{"text":"Me likey Me Gusta tacos. 

It blows my mind that I have yet to write a review for Me Gusta Tacos, but I've been here more times than I've actually checked in on Yelp. The venue is clean, bright and satisfying just like the menu, which is packed with burritos, nachos, healthy bowl options, stacked tater tots and of course tacos. 

The tacos here are the bomb and very filling. My personal favorites are the veggie tacos filled with portobello mushrooms and the Kalbi beef. If you're not familiar with Kalbi beef, it's a marinated sliced beef that has a tangy and mildly sweet flavor. From what I understand it's the owner's wife's family recipe. 

My go-to lately has been the California Burrito with Kalbi beef. Normally a Cali Burrito comes with fries, but Me Gusta's comes packed with tater tots, Kalbi beef, cheese, and sour cream, hubba hubba that's some sexy food! The crunchy tots, the sweet Kali, and the salty cheese, is a match made in burrito heaven. 

Stop what you're doing now and get over to Me Gusta Tacos. You're tummy will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"Delicious and great customer service! I have tried the California burrito, the stacked tater tots, carnitas taco, pork belly taco and the Korean taco. All tasted great but the pork belly is by far my favorite. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. They go above and beyond to make customers happy. This place will be a new favorite of mine. Also, the habanero salsa is super hot but if you can handle the heat it's a perfect blend of sweet and spice!"}
{"text":"Got the standard 3 taco plate and a drink.  One hidden gem that the menu does not have (or maybe I missed it) is the ability to mix and match tacos.  Genius!  A little on the pricey side (3 tacos for $9.50) and the tacos are relatively small (3 bites and the taco is gone).  Quality is outstanding, flavors are full and rich, and each taco is uniquely presented.

From the moment you walk in, it is very vibrant, classy, and modernistic.  The right wall has an interesting decor choice with various wall pots with plants placed all around.  Interior is a bit small and cramped, but building itself is not very big.  A few times, the booth next to me had to get up and squeeze out, but I had to slide my table to give them more room, but it blocked the table on the other side in.  Overall location is a little tricky to find.  It is NOT along the main road; you have to go into an alley and it's the 2nd business in.  Signage is good and helps point it out.  At the register, if there is a line and another associate, they will leave the counter with a tablet and take the order of the next person in line.  Very convenient!

I will have to come again and try the burritos.  Hopefully the size and portion is bigger, I'm sure the quality will still be the same.  This visit I got shredded chicken, fish, and Korean taco.  My only concern (other than size), is the fish taco looked more like a small fish stick placed in the taco, and it did not even go from Edge to edge of the tortilla.  Still tasted good so won't rate low for that."}
{"text":"NOTHING SPECIAL, DONT DO IT! Very very disappointed! I ordered uber eats carne asada tacos. First, MEAT tasted pan cooked, soggy, over cooked and tasteless. Generic corn tortillas. Not enough LIMES literally they give you a quarter of a lime for three tacos. SALSA needs flavor. FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY THEY DONT GIVE YOU GUACAMOLE OR BEANS...AND THEY RAN OUT OF ALL THE FRESH DRINKS, yeah thanks a lot... ur welcome for my business, never again."}
{"text":"Won't go back. Very expensive for tiny tacos. Barely warm. Wish I  had asked for my money back."}
{"text":"So bomb! ! Had a Carne and a chicken taco,they are great. .oh and they had a 1 free taco coupon!  Love free stuff!!"}
{"text":"Me Gusta tacos is the perfect name for this place. The menu is very limited to tacos & a couple burritos. Got both & both were knock outs. Tacos come in 3 & you can mix & match. Also have draft wine & beer. Yes draft wine not a typo. All in all if you want tacos chips burritos this is your spot definitely a lunch over dinner spot."}
{"text":"I work in Henderson once or twice a month and always try to stop in here for lunch.  VERY nice, courteous, friendly people and having only been in a few times, they still remember me - which is a nice touch.  I order the \"Mission Burrito\" but order it without the tortilla and instead as a rice bowl.  This place has to have the best shredded chicken I've ever had....I'm very picky about chicken and the shredded chicken here is what keeps me coming back!  You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality, and that they take pride in making things right.  I'll keep coming back when I'm in town!  (And as an added bonus, the owner has an adorable little baby who just happened to be there the last two times I was in visiting...cutest little baby ever!  Made my day!)"}
{"text":"This place has delicious tacos and salsas. They make their salsa fresh daily! I love the pork belly taco and fish taco, but everything is good here. You cannot go wrong. 

Try some tots with pork belly on top. That's heaven."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and it was very good. Simple menu but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Love it!  I love Korean kabli beef!  I love Tacos!  Putting them together makes for amazing dishes!  Great location too at the district!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"Me gusta el taco que comi. Served with a handful of tortilla chips, the carnitas taco is an excellent snack. I devoured the slow cooked pork, which was perfectly adorned with pico de gallo and avocado. I was seduced by the Chia Seed Lemonade. Tart and refreshing! To top it off, my order was ready lightning fast.

If you must claw your way through a maze of exuberant teenagers, please do to try out Me Gusta Tacos."}
{"text":"We're all aware of these new taco shops that have popped up over the last two years here, but they are pretty hit or miss quality.

My second time here, so there's a lot of pros and cons. Haven't tasted everything yet, but well on my way.

First off, the staff and interior. Just great on both counts. Everyone I came in contact with was nice. And by nice I don't mean Polite. Well trained cordial staff is one thing. This is different. People here are nice, jovial, and just very laid back while still providing great customer service. Not forced at all.  To go along with this the interior of the establishment is spotless and well designed. Very bright and open, with everything  being in the right place.

Now the food. Overall, the best tacos I have ever had, with a few dishes trailing in the back. Let's start with the stars of the show.

Korean Kalbi. I've had this twice and if there was a more perfect taco I don't know what it is. Just the right amount of beef, seasonings and veggies. I normally don't care for corn tortillas, but these little babies are the right consistency to hold up to a semi-wet filling. I could eat these things every single day and not complain.

Char Broiled Carne Asada. There's not a lot of times that I can almost complain about too much beef, but this one's right on the cusp. For a little taco, there's so much flavor and volume to this thing it's almost ridiculous. Subtle char flavor on some nice cuts of meat. My second favorite for sure.

Barbacoa. This is the most traditional of the dishes I think, and they nailed it beautifully. Rations of beef to toppings is spot on. Little juicy so prepare for some mess, but it's well worth it.

Fish. My least favorite. Not much taste. More like a fish stick with a little bit of salad. Overdone and no flavor. Definitely a pass.

Ceviche. I have mixed feelings about this. The dish itself was fresh, and had the right proportions of shrimp to onions and avocado. However, they added some spice to it I cannot quite put my finger on. Neither cumin nor cilantro. Just not sure what it is, but it ruins the dish. Whatever it is it overwhelmed everything else, including the sour lime taste. If I can't taste the lime in a raw fish dish, I'm definitely out. 100%.

Nachos. I know I say perfect a lot in this review, but I really have to lay one down here. These are nachos. Just the right amount of cheese to guac to black olives and black beans. That's right folks; no olives and black beans equals no mas nachos. These bad boys are the real deal and should be in the dictionary as the very definition of what nachos should be.

Aqua Fresca. This is an unqualified review since I've never had it before, but this might be my favorite new drink in the entire world. I asked for the pineapple fresca and it was amazing. I think there might be pineapple and basil in it, I'm not sure. Regardless, it is so delicious I might visit just for this drink. 

Salsa. Whoever makes the salsa here should get a congressional medal. It is the best salsa I've ever had. Their green salsa is fantastic, but the habaneros is my new obsession. It is sweet to start out with (mango maybe?) and then it lights your a$$ up something fierce. Not a lingerer, but definitely a solid face puncher. Super, fantastically hot, and then just mellows right out. I know some pepper heads just want the ultra hot rush, but this delivers a great taste with a great experience. Ask for an extra serving and then put it on your eggs the next day. Super, Duper, Delish.

Two major complaints to put out there. 

One; someone fix the freaking tables! They wobble more than a six year old getting off of the Teacup ride at Disneyland.

Two; change your location. Y'all are literally a 90 second car ride from my place. You're way too close to be this great. :)

Short version, just try it out. You definitley won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this joint hoping I can explore the menu and try it for myself. Today is the day. Located in the heart of the District. I took my friends to try the tacos. 
Since it's my first time at this joint, the girl at the counter just saw me staring at the menu board trying  to figure out what I wanted. Not a whole lot on the board but something for everyone including a breakfast and vegetarian menu. She  was kind enough to suggest that I can have 3 different tacos on 1 order so I opted for a fish taco, carnitas taco and the Kalbi taco, along with a pineapple basil  agua fresca drink.
I am rating this place a 5 star! 
Why? Clean, light, defined flavors. This is not your typical Mexican, fast  food joint where every food on the menu tastes some kind of taco seasoning, jalapeño,  with heavy, greasy,cheesy, sloppy stuff. 
Have you ever heard of the saying \"less is more\"? This is the kind of menu.
It is a contemporary approach to light and healthy eating and satisfying.
The only thing that needs a little tweaking is on the Kalbi flavor and I'm hoping they can make it a little more authentic. Kalbi has a deeper, richer marinade flavor between soy and  brown sugar. The Kalbi taco I had today needed it.
If your palate is up for an adventurous mix of exotic fruit, regular fruit mixed with herbs, 
the Agua Fresca drinks is refreshing and exciting!  Maybe not for everyone! Taste test is a must! lol.  Super good!
Can't wait to try the burritos next time.
By the way, excellent customer service!  if you're seated outside by the splash pad, they continue to check on you. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Las Vegas we decided to eat at this off strip local favorite Mexican (fusion) restaurant.  It was SO good. We sampled the aqua fresca (fresh fruit waters) and out of the 4 choices, both selected cantaloupe. Very tasty...and addicting!
Guests order at the counter and then wait at your table. (We waited maybe 10 minutes tops)
We love tacos, and each chose 3/$9....they come in an environmentally friendly container with chips. 
Sorry, I don't remember exact names but between us we had veggie, pork belly, bahn mi, and another pork choice. Every meat was marinated and cooked perfectly. The vegetables and slaw topping were very fresh. 
There was also 3 house made salsas, verde, roja and our favorite habanero....it was sweet with hints of orange peel? and very spicy...sooo good. 
The restaurant was very clean with modern minimalist decor....and the gentleman who was at the counter was courteuous, knowledgeable and stopped by our table to ask about our experience. I can totally tell why this is a favorite local stop! Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"The food has a very original flavor. It's refreshing to go and experience something like no other. It is rather pricy but we'll worth the splurge if you have the cash to spare. I love the flavored water selection they have."}
{"text":"Soooo my client said she went here today and it was amazing... soooo I had to try it. OH MY GOSH!!! Best tacos ever! My husband and I tried 6 different tacos. Every single one was amazing! I seriously don't have enough positive adjectives to describe their food. My favorite was probably the pork belly and fish. My husbands was barbacoa and carne asada. The service was great, the place is very clean, and the salsas and drinks are sooo good. Definitely will be back a bunch!"}
{"text":"This place could probably be good but the kalbi burrito that i had was wayyyyyyy to sweet...i have never had steak that taste like churro...if uou come here get something other then the kalbi."}
{"text":"The owners of this tasty joint have done such an awesome job with the ambiance and the menu! From the lovely plant wall to the kickin' habanero salsa, all around an awesome place to eat! Don't hesitate to check it out TODAY!!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh & flavorful no matter what I get! Always a pleasant experience whether dining in or taking out largely because of the friendly, welcoming atmosphere. An employee offered me samples of all their fresh juices and made a great suggestion to mix the pineapple basil with the hibiscus - so good! My favorite tacos are the Korean Kalibi and the Pork Belly - I get them every time and they're always amazing! If you're hungry and want a taste of something refreshingly different from your normal Mexican food establishment - go to Me Gusta Tacos!!!"}
{"text":"You MUST order the Korean Kalbi tacos!!

Upon entering - Me Gusta is clean, inviting and welcoming! The staff greeted us immediately.

We ordered one of every taco and churro. Hey, no judgement, were foodies! We also ordered the tots. Yum-o!! The fish and Korean Kalbi tacos were our favorite, but all of them were delicious and fresh especially due to the house made sauces. We recommended they sell them as we'd love to have these at home!

I didn't even mention their drinks yet! Homemade drinks along with a few adult beverages. The lemon chia and pineapple basil drinks are incredible and are just the right amount of sweet. A must try!

All in all a great experience and delicious place to eat! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Me Gustavo Tacos when they first opened excellent service and great food. It is a lil pricy $ but worth it would definitely go here again! The staff was friendly best place to get tacos"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! Food and service is amazing- and the peppermint horchata is to die for"}
{"text":"This place is very simple. Its nice and clean inside and its spacious. The food is really good. The steak and kalbi meat is really yummy! Owner is very friendly :) All the workers are always happy to help and never have attitude. They even check up on you if you dine in. And their salsa is the best part. The green salsa is a MUST try."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp burrito today was delicious . Salsa was fresh ! I really enjoyed my lunch today ! I'll be coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Bahn-Mi Tacos....absolutely amazing!   We also had just about every other type of taco.  The Korean BBQ taco was good as well, but the Bahn-Mi I will be going back for.  
  My kids loved the Quesedilla's too."}
{"text":"Shrimp burrito was my favorite but today not that great. Not sure what was cold cheese or rice but it was room temp cold but fridge cold. I also ordered a side of guacamole but it wasn't fresh avocado and had no flavor neither did mild salsa. Been here a couple times and really disappointing today. Not sure if I'll b back. Gave three stars because it's been better b4."}
{"text":"This place is 10/10! I was lucky enough to stop by on the first day of their Durango location and loved it. The people working at the counter were very welcoming. The menu is simple but delicious and there is a little something for everybody. The GM was walking around and his family and/or friends (I think) and seemed really nice. I has the shrimp burrito and a side of the habanero salsa and side of the salsa verde. The habanero has a nice kick and the salsa verde had delicious flavor. Will 100% go back! Gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing fusion Mexican food! Their use of tator-tots puts a whole new spin on delicious. Place is super busy, but service is fast and friendly. I eat there most every time I'm at The District.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. California Burrito is my favorite go-to menu item when I'm there."}
{"text":"Tried this place out one day trying to kill some time, the tacos definitely did not disappoint. Although I was kind of sad that the sauces weren't spicy at all. (But everyone's preference will be different) The reason I brought down a star was for the price. I wouldn't consider eating here if you have to pay for multiple people since they don't exactly have refills for drinks and they aren't essentially cheap (even for water)."}
{"text":"Great flavors! Clean place! Salsa is tasty!

Will come again sometime. Little far from me."}
{"text":"Artisan tacos at their best! Fruity citrus habanero salsa was fabulous on my carnitas & pollo tacos.  Chips were fresh and hot. Wish I was staying in the area longer to try more items.  I'll be back next time I'm in the area.  #healthy"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for fresh, flavorful and delicious tacos! My taca trifecta of choice is the Carne Asada, Pork Belly Banh Mi and the Korean Kalbi. My wife is more of a burrito gal, so the Mission Burrito with barbacoa is right up her alley. 

Also, the place is clean and the staff are super friendly.

Give this place a try next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I guess I will be the odd one out. I ordered a chicken taco and carnitas taco. They do put a lot of meat, they are not stingy at all there. Tortillas are good, but my chicken was so dry. I only took one bite and was practically choking on it. Carnitas was ok, nothing special. Now at $3.50 per taco, WOW!! That is not even a tad bit overpriced, that is over the top. For the kalbi and pork belly tacos I can see that price maybe. But for the others, absolutely not. I tried 2 of the 3 salsas and thought they were just ok. 

The place is nice, new and clean. The cashier was super friendly, I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos.....basil and pineapple drink...soo yummy....not a chain hope they get local support!"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. No flavor whatsoever it was pretty disappointing to say the least. Tacos broke apart as soon as you pick them up because of how greasy and watery it was. Let's just say I make better tacos at home for less than $25 for what I paid for this garbage. Also paid almost 3 dollars for a tiny tiny side of guacamole. Smh I want my fucking money back!"}
{"text":"Super amazing food . This is my new hot spot to go eat lunch with friends or have a nice dinner. The stacked tater tots are so good,  a must try if you stop in."}
{"text":"It's Mexican food for people who pronounce the \"L's\" in quesadilla.  

Came here after a hard workout and ended up ordering a breakfast burrito.  Nothing technically wrong with the flavor, just zero complexity and it was served with tater-tots which I found to be a bit surprising.  As you can see by the picture they used an entire carton of eggs for the burrito which made it a little difficult to get through, but hey, anything for low carb lean protein right? 

3 stars total; one for the space.  It's as nice as you can get for a gentrified taqueria.  One for the service- folks were friendly.  Another star for the portion sizes.  I couldn't even take down half of the burrito.  

Will I be back?  Probably not, but not every flame melts everybody's butter.  Personally, I prefer my ethnic food with a little more ethnicity."}
{"text":"Really good fusion tacos. Fav is def The California with Kalbi but haven't tried them all yet. Their agua frescas are delicious as well. I believe they are made fresh as opposed to getting out of a fountain machine. 

The dining room is clean and inviting. The sun shines through so it's not dreary and dark. The drink station and hot sauce station is clean and tidy. The have salsa verde, roja and habanero. My recommendation would be the habanero. 

If you're in the mode for fusion tacos/burritos, this place is a must."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best places to eat in Henderson. Always good food and always a friendly staff. If you want amazing food and you like things that taste good, you should go here. Never disappointing. Never."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Small seating inside but additional outdoor seating is a huge plus. Easy parking as it's located inside The District."}
{"text":"Tacos were good a little disappointed with the tortillas. I just think they're pricey for the size over $3 dlls each! Don't think I'll go back. 3 stars for costumer service, and tasty tater tots. This place is Korean right???!!!! NOT MEXICAN!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim because I was craving tacos and it did not disappoint! I had the carnitas and chicken tacos and the strawberry lemonade agua fresca. The tacos were delicious and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of meat they put in each taco. The pico and avocado on top was just perfect. They have a variety of house made salsas to choose from to accompany your meal. The tacos came with a side of chips which tasted very fresh; next time I'll order a side of guac to go with my chips! The agua fresca was very refreshing and not too sweet at all. The staff were all very nice and professional, and the restaurant itself looked very clean. I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I had to come twice, thats how much I liked this place. Very friendly staff, ordering was pretty easy and food dishes out super quick. 

I ordred the korean kalbi, porkbelly ban mi, carnitas taco, tator tots, the mission and shrimp burrito. Very clean and quick, food were superb. 

The rating of spice didn't match the level I expected. Side note, their tortillas fell apart before I could even try them. Soon as I pick one up, breaks through and collapses. 

My high expectations were meet, so I'll be coming back for more. Food 7/10 and service 10/10."}
{"text":"I would give Me Gusta Tacos SIX STARS if I could'Easily one of the best restaurants in this part of town! 

I've been here several times, and everything I've had has surpassed all expectations. The breakfast burrito, the California burrito, the pork belly taco, the kalbi taco, all of it is f***ing delicious and dangerously addicting! 

If you're craving tacos or burritos, make the trip. It'll only take one visit to make you a believer!"}
{"text":"Really quite delicious. I loved the fish taco and my husband loved the pork belly taco and we both loved the kalbi. We will definitely return and we both want to try a burrito!"}
{"text":"Aqua Fresca watermelon basil was good but the pork tacos are just okay. I don't think the guac is fresh or real so that was a disappointment. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Place is clean, burritos that we ordered for to go several times was delish.  Just a bit pricey though especially the side of guacamole."}
{"text":"I recently came by this Me Gusta Tacos location for lunch with some friends. The manager was nice enough to let us push some tables together so we could all sit together. Inside was clean and there's a good amount of tables. The menu says they offer all natural meats, sustainable fish and real fruit agua fresca. The food definitely tasted fresh and the salsa that's made from scratch on site each day is very good. One friend couldn't get enough of the salsa verde while I couldn't get enough of the salsa roja. They have a \"spicy level\" on each jar, but everyone at our table agreed that it's off because the spiciness simply wasn't there like indicated, though still fresh and delicious tasting.

Stacked Tater Tots ($7) - Tater tots, mild cheddar cheese, guacamole and sour cream. The tots were crispy and tasty. I really liked the fresh taste of the guacamole, but there was a lot of cheese melted at the bottom and I'd have liked the cheese to be put on more evenly on the tots. 

Roasted Corn with Bacon ($4) - This was very flavorful. Bacon was freshly cooked, the cheese added great flavor and the corn had a nicely roasted taste. The burritos are so big that the corn was enough for a couple of us to share making the price reasonable for such a fresh and tasty side. 

Me Gusta Bowl ($7) - Quinoa, roasted corn, red cabbage, avocado, queso fresco with mango dressing and your choice of meat. I chose the shredded chicken and it had good flavor. This whole dish had great flavor and I didn't even add the dressing. 

Carnitas Tacos ($9.50 for 3 tacos) - Pork, pico de gallo and avocado on a corn tortilla. The tacos were filled with meat and tasted great. The fresh avocado slices really capped it off. A side of tortilla chips came with the tacos, so don't forget to use some of the fresh salsas on the tables on them. You can get small plastic containers of salsa for take out orders. 

Steak and Egg Burrito ($8.50) - Carne asada, scrambled eggs, guacamole and mile cheddar cheese. This burrito also comes with a side of Breakfast Tater Tots, that have cinnamon or some sort of seasoning on them that tasted really good. The burrito was filled with a good amount of meat and eggs and was my favorite of what I have tried from here. Great price for the portion. 

Korean Kalbi Tacos ($9.50 for 3 tacos) - Korean steak and Asian cabbage slaw served on a corn tortilla. Others liked this at my table, but I didn't. Hubby found a long black hair in his (it was remade with no problem) and some of the meat was still raw which isn't something I am a fan of.

Caramel and Bavarian Cream Churros ($2.50) - There was a good amount of cinnamon and sugar, but these churros could have benefited from something to dip them in like maybe whipped cream. Chocolate sauce would be great too. The caramel churros had enough \"wet\" in the middle to work, but the bavarian ceam churros were a bit dry for me. At $2.50 each I don't think a dollop of whipped cream would hurt. 

Some of the other items tried was the Shrimp Burrito which some felt had more rice than shrimp, the California Burrito that was filled with tons of meat and flavorful, and Fish Tacos that I didn't try, but others seemed to like. I'm interested in coming back to try the Spicy Bacon Burrito. Since they are focused on serving healthy items, you will not find any refried beans on the menu and instead they serve black beans. Decent spot to stop for breakfast, lunch, dinner or meal to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They staff was super friendly! I will be back!! I had the California Burrito and I thought it was mucho bueno! If you like a little kick you have to try the salsa Habanero."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great food. This is a must try when in the district Area.

Highlights:

-California burrito
-Pork belly tacos"}
{"text":"One star for cleanness, another for customer service and a third star for effort. 

A step up from Taco Bell, but nothing near anything more."}
{"text":"Best GF food I've ever eaten! Need a great quick lunch/dinner in Henderson, this is the place to go!! Nachos good, corn tacos good, Churros awesome!! Did I mention Agua Fresca?? Watermelon mint, refreshing and ready to face the long day by the pool!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting the flavor!  Not at all what I was expecting.  I can't even explain it.  And then the salsa's again flavors that I wasn't expecting or use to.  The \"Hot one\"  Was sweet and spicy, but not hot \"to me\"  The Medium one was the only one that had a familiar flavor, and the mild one.......No thank you!   Now don't get me wrong, I don't expect all burritos and salsas to taste the same.   But this just wasn't my cup of tea!  I know alot of people really like this place, so my motto is, give it a try, you might like it."}
{"text":"Looking for something different in the District I stopped in me Gusta for lunch. The menu offered basic Mexican style food, some with a twist with all Natural Meats, Sustainable Fish and Real Fruit Agua Fresca.
-I decided to try the California burrito. You get to choose your protein, mine was Kalbi, and it comes with tater tots, cheese and sour cream. A small side of chips on the side and I ordered a side of guacamole. Kalbi had excellent flavors and I like the crunchy tots vs potatoes or fries. I wasn't sure about the pineapple mint aqua fresca before order but glad that I did. Not one flavor dominated the other and it was very refreshing. Can't wait to get bake to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Recently bought a place in Henderson so checking out the area around my place.  Found MGT on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I ordered the the Kalbi, Pork, and Fish tacos.  Everything came out delicious and yummy, although the pork one is the on \"dry\" side however still taste great.  The missing star is because the price is a bit steep for a taco... Friendly staff and yummy food, will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the tacos here; they just weren't anything to write home about ? I thought the minimal design would be an indicator that they were really focused on food only but we got multiple types of tacos and none of them were very good. I also found it a little weird that you had to request a lime w your beer, request napkins (and they give you one) etc. although I suppose it could be a method of reducing waste; just found it abnormal."}
{"text":"This place was just short of perfect.
My husband had the kalbi, barbacoa and carne asada tacos. I had the fish, carnitas and pork belly banh mi tacos. 
Our first reaction is that these are just a hair bigger than street tacos but almost twice the cost. 3 for $9.50 or 1 for $3.50. However, after tasting most of them, we agreed it was worth it.
He really liked the 3 he had.
The carnitas taco was pretty good.
The fish taco had zero salt on it so the only thing I could taste was a faint hint of wasabi in the crema. It looked really good but I couldn't taste anything on it.
The banh mi taco was to die for. The pork belly was deliciously and perfectly cooked. Combined with the pickled carrot and daikon, this pairing was heavenly.
We both agreed that the tortilla chips served alongside the tacos were amazing. They have that homemade taste and feel. Very fragile and thinly crunchy, expertly done. They also have that almost-too-salty taste that I just adore, especially when mixed with their delicious green salsa.
Will be back for some more of those banh mi tacos and tortilla chips, when we can save up again.

$23 for 6 tacos and a drink."}
{"text":"Fun drinking game: take a shot every time a yelper playfully incorporates \"Me Gusta Tacos\" in their review. 

AnYwHoO ~ Let it be known that the day I visited Me Gusta Tacos was the day I borderline overdosed on their delicous churros. 

CARAMEL CHURRO ($2.50) - 5/5 - Me gusta tacos pero me gusta churros tambien!
YES, i know tacos are in their name but trust me their CHURROS ARE DROOL WORTHY and you can choose from a handful of fillings! Pipin' hot, generously coated in sugar and spice - yup it's everything nice in a churro. Better than Costco 4 sho. I ate 4 of them and took a dank nap after~ no ragrets. 

THE ACTUAL FOOD: As their wall states, their food is simple, but it's scrumptious. 

TACOS - 1 for $3.50, 3 for $9.50, 6 for $18. It's a step above my normal taco budget but you're paying for quality bruh! OH AND FREE CHIPS! Raid their salsa fridge to douse your chips and you'll be a happy camper.

FISH TACO - 5/5 - I'm not a big fan of wasabi, but their wasabi crema that lubricated the fish married the cabbage and cilantro nicely. The fish was flaky and delicious. Note that it's grilled, not battered and deep fried like most typical fish tacos - good move for the health conscious. Handmade corn tortillas? - made all the difference!

MISSION BURRITO ($8)- 4.5/5 - Rice, pico, guac, cheese and your choice of meat - i got the kalbi. Love how they toast their burritos so there's a subtle crunch. Check out my pic, SUPERB meat to rice ratio!!! My only complaint is that I felt like the kalbi asian flavor was lost with the other components on the burrito - i wish they had a more asian flavors-centered burrito that incorporated kimchi and/or their asian slaw to complement the kalbi. Still a delicious burrito tho, can't deny that.

WATERMELON MINT AGUA FRESCA ($3.50) - 5/5 - Sublime when you overdose on their habanero salsa. Refreshing. 10/10 would sip in vegas heat. No artificial flavorings here, this is the real deal.

BONUS POINTS:
- they serve local Vegas brewed beer!! WHAAT! 
- potted plants adorned on the wall = totez instagram worthy! 
- BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY!!

OVERALL: It's a delicious spin on quality, fresh Mexican food that even your yoga instructor will approve of. TRY IT!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We order a couple things just to try this place out and each piece we tried got better and better!
Shrimp me gusta bowl 
Carnitas mission burrito 
Fish, Kolbi, Vegetarian, and Chicken Tacos 
Agua fresca strawberry 
Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good! I got a steak burrito, chips and tried a whole bunch of salsa! I looove the mango one. The food here is delicious, but also makes me feel like I'm eating clean, which is a plus. Thanks for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"The pork belly taco and nachos and delicious, as well as churros. Nice twist to authentic tacos. Only drawback was the carnitas taco tasted like there was some cinnamon in it, not sure if I liked that."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, questionable prices if you get anything with shrimp. Just to add a few pieces of shrimp is an added $5 or more. That kinda sucks, especially because the shrimp has obviously been frozen at some point and not very fresh. Very good location and atmosphere! Unless you go Friday and the complex is overrun with children getting out of school."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. My review is bias cause I'm not usually not a fan of fusion food. But we wanted to try this place (I had no idea it was fusion tacos). The tacos lacked flavor and the Korean kalbi tasted like teriyaki beef jerky. So they weren't my favorite. BUT I did enjoy the tater tots nachos. They don't have a soda fountain, they have some juices to choose from and a small selection of bottle sodas. It was a little disappointing considering what we paid for our meal, I guess I was just expecting a little bit more. If someone enjoyed fusion flavors, they might enjoy this spot. It just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Had the Pork Belly Banh Mi and Korean Kalbi tacos with corn/bacon side..Everything was delicious!! We'll be back"}
{"text":"I like this place. The kalbi taco is by far my fave. My husband really digs the carnitas taco. Their green salsa is super delish and their agua frescas are pretty decent. And the employees super-nice!"}
{"text":"Their food is good but don't order delivery with grub hub they don't honor the delivery times, I learned the hard way I'll just be picking up my orders from now on"}
{"text":"I was super hungry tonight and decided to check out Me Gusta. I've been to a few other taco joints such as Bruno's Taco Bar and wanted to give this place a try. It's a nice seating area with good drinks and simple beer selection. We ordered essentially one of every taco. The first thing I noticed about the tacos were that they were very generous with the meat, and with me being super hungry I was very happy about this. 

The meat of the Carne Asada, Pork Belly, and Korean Kalbi were really well seasoned however I do feel like the tacos overall were lacking in toppings. I do like that the star of the dish is the meat, but I do feel that the tacos need additional toppings or sauces to bring it all together and I do feel like this is where some other places like Bruno excels in. I did really like the complimentary salsa's and free Tortilla chips which take away some of the dryness of the plain taco. I would definitely come back to try their other items such as their burritos, but as they told me, their tacos are their most popular dishes."}
{"text":"Order shrimp burrito, tots, bacon and corn it was delicious. Will be going back. Great location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how amazing this place is! The owner is completely customer service savvy. I am so excited every time I come here to eat, because it is a time for me to digress and simply enjoy  my company and myself. The atmosphere is conducive to such! Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Out of three tacos I only liked one.  The service was good, but the food was surprising and not in a good way.  The pork was sweet and not what I wanted or expected in  a taco.  The carnitas had a chargrilled taste, the meat tasted gamey, and had a chewy taste.  I will say however that the chicken taco was good but what really made it were the sauces.  I loved the flavor of the super spicy habanero salsa, it had a pineapple or possible mango taste that really made it enjoyable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and bright. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. 

If your looking for beers or sangria to go with your tacos, you've found the place! Awesome sangria's that you can almost customize with their different agua frescas. 

They have three types of sauces; green, rojo and habanero. The sauces were just ok... not super tasteful, maybe under salted, and the sauce was separated, as we squeezed it out, only the water/liquid would come out first. 

Tacos actually had too much meat to tortilla ratio. I like a full taco but it's was huge mouthfuls of meat on a single corn tortilla. 

The baked tater tots were very delicious, they melted fresh cheese on top instead of gross cheddar cheese sauce, thank you!! 

You get chips with the 3 taco dish - $9.5."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in the city! The food tastes great, the staff is very welcoming and friendly. It's one of my favorite new spots in the district.  5 stars well earned!"}
{"text":"Everything on this menu is great! I go here often for lunch and order for my office regularly And they never disappoint. A few of my favorites are the black bean salad, the spicy bacon burrito, and the kalbi meat."}
{"text":"Me gusta real authentic tacos. These aren't it! Staff was friendly, place was clean, and ambience was chill. But the food was eh! Over priced food and drinks. Including the aguas frescas and they're way to artificially sweetened. If you want some gringo style tacos then I guess this is your place. You want some yummy tacos with yummy salsas go somewhere else. Hell Ricos (delicious) Tacos El Tio is just up the way and fantastic. First and last visit for me ?"}
{"text":"Yum! 

We ordered delivery through ubereats, and it was so good! The carnitas burrito was good but the cinnamon threw us off, however the filling ratio on the burrito was great, you didn't get a bite of one thing then something different.. it was perfectly layered so you got a bite of everything with each bite.  

Pork belly tacos= amazing! 
Kalbi beef tacos= meh, ok.. kalbi I've had in the past was super tender and not chewy, this kalbi beef was very chewy and  it made the taco fall apart.. 

They swapped my tortilla chips for a small side of tater tots which was nice because I didn't want a ton of tortilla chips. Well, turns out they're extra delicious with the homemade salsas they provide.. 

I want to go here sometime and try the food at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Had the pork belly, Korean kalbi, and fish. I'm not keen on fish tacos and not sure why I ordered it but the pork belly and Korean kalbi were good! I tried all three salsas. The habanero was hot, but sweet. I loved the green salsa and the milder red salsa. The chips were good, too. I'll be back for more tacos!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and friendly staff. Very clean and the food is amazing!! Go check it out then shop the farmers market! Great date night"}
{"text":"Ordered from these guys on UberEATS one hungover morning. Wasn't expecting to be blown away as much as I was. I usually want to just lay in a fetal position and drink pedialyte after a night like I had but instead I got the California burrito with Kalbi and the steak and egg burrito with tots. Amazing. The Korean Kalbi is so damn good. This place is probably as good as or better than Komex. And a better start to your morning than Robertos. Give them a try on UberEATS. Free delivery and was super fresh and warm. 

This code will get you $10 off your first order: eats-alexandera974ue."}
{"text":"What's not good about this place?
I can't think of a damn thing. 

I had the California burrito with carne asada and it was the best carne I've tasted, EVER.
Not to mention those stacked tots, that's something to cry for. (Happy tears of course)

What compelled me to write this post was not the food (even though it deserves its own post) it was the quality of service. My burrito came out slightly later than the rest of the food that was served at my table so, a few minutes after getting my food, I was approached with an apology and an offer for a complimentary drink. SAY WHAT? That's right, this place is set with such high standards waiting even 5 more minutes is unacceptable. I really had no intention to complain, in my opinion, it wasn't even that long of a wait. But, the fact that I was approached was a breath of fresh air. 

EVERYTHING about this place is awesome. Your tastebuds will thank you twice over for putting this restaurant at the top of your list!"}
{"text":"Pineapple basil drink is tasty and the service is friendly but their carne asada tacos have to be one of the worst I've had in town and ridiculously overpriced given its size, quality and location. Tacos El Gordo and Taco y Taco tacos are not only much tastier but much cheaper and represents a greater value in every sense of the word. I'm quite disappointed given how it's expensive these tacos are. I wouldn't even buy it at $1 unless they improve the quality. Their habanero sauce is also similarly tasteless without the proper smoky fruitiness naturally present in habanero peppers.

Tacos from Me Gusta taste like subpar, overpriced tacos from the east coast. My apologies to the owner and cooks but there needs to be a serious revamping of the standard tacos."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Super fresh food and awesome service. I've had the taco plate with carne asada, fish, and barbacoa, the shrimp ceviche, the California burrito with kalbi, the steak and egg breakfast burrito, and the sangria with pineapple basil agua fresca. 

Check this place out if you haven't been. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their Kalbi burrito is off the charts good. Friendly service and really delicious angus frescas. Don't forget to get a churro before you leave. I think everyone should give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Gave it a second try and was very satisfied this time around. Ordered their breakfast burrito,along with the watermelon mint water and of course the chocolate pancakes."}
{"text":"Great tacos, nice area.  The new trend is the minimalist look.  This place may not look like a regular Mexican restaurant, but it is definitely a family-friendly and welcoming place.  Food tastes great.  I asked for the 3-taco order and had their 3 most popular tacos."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh tacos burritos and salads oh my! And their salsa! Let's talk about that for a sec....they offer 3 kinds of house-made salsas....refrigerated to keep them fresh and cold. Salsa roja, verde and habanero. So delicious and a perfect compliment to their delicious (AND HEALTHY!) food. I love their grilled fish tacos and their black bean salad.  My hubby loves their kalbi tacos. Great guac, and chips come with every order!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place several times now and finally stopped in, and really glad I did.

The restaurant has a really cool vibe, good music, and pretty contemporary in design. 

The food was really good, I mean really good.

They have the Spanish influence of tacos and burritos, but some have a little extra flair on them such as some of the dishes with Korean Kalbi on or in them.

They food was really unique, but also really good, perfect for a midday snack and not too heavy.

I really recommend you check them out, I know you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We came in because of Yelp. Their sustainable fish tacos are grilled and not breaded. So yummy. Fred had the California burrito. Non GMO. I had the hibiscus tea. Happy, happy!"}
{"text":"Yooo I just tried this place , Kalbi tacos are stupid good , I also had a fish taco and carne asada taco and both were above expectations . The red and green salsa are perfect spicy level with lots of flavor . Looking forward to trying different things in the menu, will be back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Green Valley area. You do have to park and walk but the walk isn't too far at all. 
This place is tucked in between lots of cool shops, bars, and other food places. In the middle of all this is a cute little fountain that kids are playing in. 
It seems there might be hosted events outside on the \"street\" as there was a stage platform. 

When my boyfriend and I first entered we were instantly greeted by two of the employees at the register (wish I'd gotten their names as they had excellent customer service). The ordering process was a lot simpler than I'd anticipated. They offer bowls, burritos, and tacos. 

I ordered one of the shredded chicken street tacos, one barbacoa taco, and one carne Asada taco. Each taco meal comes with tortilla chips. I then got a house made \"Agua Fresca\" ( I chose strawberry lemonade) and it was delicious! The tacos were all very good (I think the barbacoa was my favorite with the chicken coming in close second). They each seemed to have their own flavors and not just some generic spice mix that went on each choice of meat. They were flavorful and just the right portion sizes. 

They have red salsa, salsa verde, and habanera salsa available in a little fridge off to the side and each were very good. 

Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Was not as impressed as I was expecting to be. The location and area are great, a few tables inside with additional seating outside.  Decided to take our order to go as we were not feeling the barre group that were exercising outside and then clamored in line for food smelling of sweat funk..
Ordered the following items:  California Burrito with Kalbi Meat,  3 Shredded Pollo Tacos and a bottled Coke. Both orders come with tortilla chips.  Three different salsas are available to choose from, but be sure to ask for salsa containers with your takeout order - they do not provide it or have any out on the counter by the salsas, so you need to ask before you leave, otherwise you'll end up at home with no salsa to accompany your grub if you're like most people who don't double check your bag before walking out.

The tacos were great, but the lime pieces they included were super skinny and dry, so i hardly got anything out of those things...good thing I had salsa to help.  The salsa verde was my favorite. Hubby had the California Burrito - he said the Kalbi meat was not fresh.  It was super dry like it had been sitting out for some time and then just heated up as ordered.  He only finished half, before sliding it over my way and requesting to get food elsewhere.  I tried it also, but only a few bites - yes the meat is dry but the worst part was after taking a couple bites, I noticed a dark black piece embedded in the mix and my first thought was that it was just an overcooked piece of Kalbi - I scooped it out and it felt and looked like a huge piece of rock, it definitely was not an overcooked piece of meat.  How the hell did that get in there!? and such a big piece...this totally turned me off and I threw it all away burning the thought of ever returning to this place out of my mind.

Another disappointing strikeout."}
{"text":"Was greeted very friendly and decided on 3 vegetarian tacos. The tacos were a little better than I like but the taste was there from the filling to the corn tortillas. They have three salsas to choose from red, green and habanero and they are all super tasty. The habanero is super yummy and WAY hot. Three tacos come with chips and they are nice and thick without bwing greasy. I also got a agua fresca, pineapple and basil, it was SO good! All in all, will come back!"}
{"text":"Walking through the District trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. Came across this place. I DO NOT recommend this place! Not even an ounce of authenticity at all!!! I know I know..should've gone to Roberto's. But it was a beautiful night and this was the only option for mexican food. I ordered the nachos. Hardly ANY cheese whatsoever! Beens taste like they were out of a can. Carne asada had pieces that were two toned and tasted really weird. 
This is actually my first negative review on Yelp  Save your money and do not come here."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We needed a good taco place in the district. I've had all of their tacos and every single one is amazing! Very consistent food and a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"This place wasn't very good. I did somewhat enjoy their Korean bbq taco, but other than that I didn't enjoy their California burrito. Would rather get Roberto's or chipotle."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for street tacos, but not those greasy conventional low-quality meat tacos. Then I stumbled upon Me Gusta Tacos.  I was hopeful it smelled great, simple atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing salsas! The Carne Asada tacos had a funny taste to the marinade wasn't too bad but the Carnitas tacos were so greasy and so fatty I couldn't even finish more than one taco. Over-priced in my opinion. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Me Gusto was pleasantly surprising. Stark plain purposeful decoration but it's cool... the food is what matters. Here the food will even throw you for a loop. When you get your order which comes pretty quick. It physically looks kinda bland and plane. Rolled up to exact specs. I had a shrimp burrito and it was delicious. There sauces are also delicious. Been 3X now and the food is always very good. Always a safe bet. Go eat"}
{"text":"Best Mango hot sauce. Back when my stomach could take it ha. Very fun environment and good good burritos and tacos. Bien bien"}
{"text":"Yeah, they are that good and the salsas are addicting.  I'm kinda hooked on the Me Gusta bowl (big portions!)"}
{"text":"This place has great customer service, makes a delicious sangria, but the food... the food is so good that my mouth is watering just thinking about it as I type this review!!! I ate almost a full bottle of the green salsa while I was there because I couldn't get enough of it. I cannot recommend this place enough!!! Just go, order, enjoy. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Just moved back to Vegas and trying all these new places. I have to say this place was amazing. Got the surf and turf burrito and it was so good. Fresh ingredients and not super expensive for the amount of food you get. Also tried the pineapple basil aqua fresca and it was so good. Definitely coming back and recommending to others!"}
{"text":"Food was fire AF! Tater tots in the burrito w carne???!!! Nom nom!!! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Are you going to eat your tots?

I'm not a tater tot eater. But something made me go for those stacked tots. Definitely one of my better decisions in recent memory.  Gooey, cheesy, guacy deliciousness.  Highly recommended, especially if you are nursing a hangover.  I was not and chose them on a work day, sending myself into a food coma and an afternoon siesta. Whatta way to go. Yum, yum, yum.

I've also tried the California burrito. While tasty, it was a little on the heavy side for my taste, probably the combination of a flour tortilla AND tots inside. Me Gusta is pleasing to my belly. It's prices are on point, the food tastes fresh and a place like this was much needed in the SouthWest. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting! The food is so fresh and full of flavor. I had the black bean salad with a side of roasted corn with bacon.. it was unbelievable. And the salsas.. The Spicy Habinaro had a hint of mango/fruity flavor mixed with a decent heat of spice. The salsa verde was equally satisfying as well. I hope Me Gusta Tacos continues to grow as a business and stay at this location as long as possible."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with great service and awesome employees. I had the California burrito with pork belly and guacamole, barbacoa taco, breakfast burrito and two churros. Everything tasted phenomenal however I didn't care for the caramel churro. Overall I would absolutely recommend this restaurant and look forward to coming back soon and trying everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night on our way through town (on a road trip and trying to avoid the madness of the strip.)  Service was excellent.  We ordered a variety of tacos, a black bean salad and some guac.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about, but not terrible.  I think my exact words were, \"At least I'm not hungry anymore.\""}
{"text":"What an amazing little place in the district. Great tacos to eat while relaxing on the patio. Their hibiscus fresca and the strawberry lemonade was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. Pretty fast service, The gentleman at the register was very helpful! Awesome music, and a very modern atmosphere! I got the shrimp burrito ! It was good and had a very generous proportion of shrimp ! Oh ! And they had a bunch of agua fresca drinks that I happened to get fo free for checking in ! Will be coming back for breakfast ! And the loaded tots ! They look amazing!!"}
{"text":"I scarfed my food and forgot to take pictures!  Ordered the pork belly, kalbi, and fish tacos.  Pork  belly was my favorite.  With the pickled daikon and carrots... So good.

I also had a horchata.  And in all honesty it was good, but just gritty.  Way too much cinnamon!  I don't know if it was just the bottom of the barrel, or how they make it, but it was way gritty.

I was disappointed too in the homemade salsas.  Although the tacos didn't really need it, the salsas tasted rather plain.  They were on the watery side, and lacked complexity of flavor.  My Mexican friends tell me that the salsa is what sets places apart, and for me the salsa here was just a let down.  Too simple, and lacked complexity of flavor.  

I will return here.  They really do make their motto of \"simple\" taste good!  Next thing to try - the burritos!"}
{"text":"It was taco Tuesday so my friend and I were looking to try a new Mexican place. The reviews and menu made this place look good. The place is small, clean, and the staff is very friendly. They have 3 salsas that are house made, the verde and roja both are quite good, the habanero is just way too sour, its sad because if it was just a little acidic it would be very good. I soon found after this that everything here has the potential to be very good but there is something off or wrong that ruins the dish completely. I ordered the 3 taco plate, Carnitas, Asada, and the Kalbi tacos, all of which were very bad. The Asada had a very strange and off putting flavor, which I couldn't identify the problem. The Kalbi, which was definitely over-hyped, tasted exactly like re-hydrated beef jerky and was very unpleasant. Unfortunately for me the last one I tried was the Carnitas, which was one of the worst things I have ever eaten. It had the flavoring of Gingerbread and was sweet. Suffice to say I will not be returning, but I hope the owner reads this, takes this review seriously, and heavily considers changing the preparations on all the meats here. I am saying this as constructive criticism, not to bring him or this place down, I feel with such adjustments this place can turn from a 1 star to a 4-5 star with ease."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas from out of town for a sales convention. This place was close to the event and I love tacos so gave it a try. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the carne asada nachos. The place is very cute and the staff is awesome! They were playing Don Omar over the speaker...so that was a definite plus. The food was ok. Ultimately it served its purpose...lunch. I've had better tacos and nachos...but it was decent food. The price for the tacos, nachos, and a strawberry lemonade was twenty-something bucks."}
{"text":"3 tacos for $9.50 and chips. Lucky the tacos were good I had carne asada tacos. Little pricey but I won't complain, it was good food. Sauce was not too spicy and not bland"}
{"text":"So good and vegan friendly (just leave off the cheese and cream sauce). Super fresh food and amazing homemade salsas. Plus plenty of outdoor seating. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific new place with some very interesting flavors. The tacos are stuffed full of deliciousness. 

The tacos are variety of flavors I liked the Carnitas Taco, the Vietnamese pork belly Banhart Mi and the Korean Kalbi.  

Three tacos comes with chips and a variety of salsas, all for very reasonable price. 

Next up on my list is the barbacoa and the charbroiled carne asada tacos. They offer burrito salads and a variety of sides. I had the pineapple basil agua fresca which was unique and delicious. I would recommend this place to you for lunch or very casual dinner. The guys behind the counter are very helpful, ask them a question about the food or the menu and you'll get a great answer Enjoy."}
{"text":"Yelpers are right. This business has earned 5 stars ~

From the moment you walk in, you are promptly greeted with a friendly smile. Great start. 

Though the menu is small, it's delicious. My first time dining here tonight and ordered 6 tacos and nachos to try. Total tab a little over $28.00. 

Food quality is fresh. Not greasy. Not soggy with unnecessary sauce. Just right. 

I like the mini fridge housing three different intensities/flavors of salsa. Green and yellow salsa  are great. 

Great location in middle area of The District shopping. If weather was cooler, it would be fun to dine outside in front of water park/interior views. 

Efficient and fast staff - no complaints. Well, besides eating carbs, ha!"}
{"text":"I've been to Me Gusta Tacos numerous times and each time the food is amazing! The shrimp burrito and the vegetarian taco are my favorites. We always get great service- they really treat you like you're eating at a sit down restaurant. The owner is super friendly and just does a great job of making you feel welcomed. Wonderful job Me Gusta Tacos! One of my favorites at the District. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Had to grab a quick bite for lunch and this place was a welcome treat! Get a variety of the tacos. Had the Korean beef, carnitas and fish and all had unique flavors. A very safe bet and friendly waitstaff helped expedite my visit! Will be back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! Took my kids to play at the splash pad and they were all hungry so ordered tacos, kids burrito, mission burrito and a pineapple basil drink! Holy yum we are foodies and my kids are picky they ate everything! Great service too! Will be back for sure I already told all
My friends! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food! The environment is clean and I love the pineapple basil drink with all my meals."}
{"text":"I love tacos and this place just reaffirms that. I had 3 tacos that came with a side of chips. I ate the pork belly, kalbi, and carne asada tacos. They are just a little bigger than a street taco so 3 was plenty for a meal, especially with the side of chips. 

In the restaurant there's a little mini fridge with some salsas you can bring back to your table. A red salsa, green salsa, and habanero. Each salsa is labeled with the level of spice where red is 4/10, green is 6/10 and habanero is 9/10. They all taste amazing! The habanero is definitely 9/10. Though, I feel like the red and green are backwards. The green is a sweet salsa, and I'd give it 2/10 for a spice level. The red has a little kick, but it's not really spicy. That one I'd give a 4/10. 

I also dig the decor of the place. It felt modern and clean. Interesting take on the fake grass on the walls. I lot of taco joints always feel a little \"cheap\", for a lack of a better term, that make you say \"yup, this is how I picture a taco join\". Me gusta is more of \"this is how a taco joint should be\". I can't wait to bring some people in to try it out."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door. The restaurant was clean, nicely organized and the staff was friendly. 

After ordering the California Burrito we went to get our soda. They have a small cooler with freshly made salsas, each a different heat level. We had to try all three!

The burrito came with chips. Not sure if they were homemade, but they may have been. They were good, nice and crispy. We split our burrito. It was very full, and with nice flavor. Our favorite ended up being the Salsa Verde. It had excellent flavor. The fact that it was chilled was a really nice treat. 

The shredded cheese inside of the burrito was not melted at all, but it was still pretty tasty. 

I love that they use recyclable trays/bowls for their food. No Styrofoam here!!! 

The atmosphere here, the cleanliness, the great staff...oh, 3 different people came to check on us to see how we were doing!!!, the fresh food...this is the reason why we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very delicious   

I had the grilled shrimp burrito and it was definitely the best shrimp burrito I've ever had. 

Fiancé had chicken tacos. They were a bit boring but good.

This is definitely my new favorite place"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Fresh and clean. I'm so happy it's close to my home. Reminds me of being in California . Thanks for the great customer service. The second time I ordered thru Uber eats and it was still hot. My new favorite place ."}
{"text":"First time here and the service was standard, friendly greeting and great tacos, excellent beverage choices and a variety of sauces that are sure to compliment the great tacos. I know to try for a burrito next time. Would come again!"}
{"text":"First time here. Yummy fresh food! Had the fish tacos and loved the crispness of the cabbage, the fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce added just the right amount of creaminess. Topped with their salsa verde salsa it was delicious. The carne asada California burrito was also great. The beef was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Don't forget to try all their salsas!  The agua fresca was a drink I had not tried before. The pineapple basil was a treat. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good! I love the nachos with shredded chicken! GMO free! If I want something lighter I get the me gusta bowl with quinoa and shrimp. My husband loves all the burritos and my kids love the street tacos. We go all the time!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and the service, unfortunately the portions were a little small for what you pay for. $9.50 for a burrito is pretty steep and a small burrito at that. They give you a nice portion of tortilla chips though, but I didn't pay for tortilla chips. I may go back if they lower the prices or give you what you pay for."}
{"text":"Got two Mission burritos through Uber Eats. Very similar to grilled stuffed burrito from a certain drive thru establishment. Nothing like a Mission district burrito. Carnitas was good. Kalbi was dry. Where are all the ingredients that are supposed to be in here? Not much food for $10. Good salsa. Wouldn't get again. Rip off."}
{"text":"So glad I finally got a chance to try this taco spot. Prices are cheap, service was great, and the tacos were absolutely scrumptious. I tried 3 tacos: the fish taco, pork belly, and shredded pollo. If I wasn't watching my girlish figure, I honestly would've ordered 3 more! Also, they have a unique selection of agua frecas, including a strawberry lemonade one that was the perfect addition to my taco plate. I personally love lemonade with a bit more tang to it and this one did not disappoint. However, if you prefer less tang and would rather have something to satisfy your sweet tooth at the end of your meal, I recommend trying the Bavarian cream filled churro. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried Me Gusta Tacos out for the first time yesterday as it has been on my list of places to check out. The food has excellent flavor and the customer service was great. Its located in a nice area to have some Mexican food and a Beer while sitting outside as well. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover they say and this totally applies to Me Gusta Tacos... In a bad way. They're located right by the fountains at The District, cute outdoor seating. The restaurant is very hipster and simple. Only a couple of tables inside and the inside echoes so much that you probably won't want to sit in. 
We ordered the California burrito which turned out to be pretty bland. There are salsas in the fridge inside, however none were at all spicy. The whole meal was just boring :( 
Me Gusta Tacos is cute, but the food turned out to be extremely disappointing. They serve alcohol and fresh juices so I'll have to try that in the future. They have a lot of potential, hopefully things improve with time!"}
{"text":"Yay for more taco places! Super friendly staff, mexican restaurant located at The District, reasonable prices for good amount of food. The korean Kalbi taco is a must! and they're not playing with their hot salsas, we tried the 9 out 10 salsa (habanero) it was extremely spicy! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"This is OK. 

The pineapple basil drink was awesome. The food was kinda meh for me. The descriptions sounded better than they actually tasted."}
{"text":"I love tacos!    ! J'aime les tacos! Te amo tacos!

There are so many ways I can express my love for tacos and one way i like to enjoy them is by devouring them in two large bites! My friend had told me a buddy of ours sold their ownership of crepe shake to open up this family operated restaurant at the district in Henderson. Now the district maybe a few years ago was a desolate, dying area but now has been revitalized with cool bars, and some remodeling, but with the appearance of Me gusta, this place has gotten only stronger.

Setting: Located right in the center of the district by due & proper, come in to the clean yet compact restaurant interior. The seating inside is sparse but there are tables outside that the employees will bring to you. Complimentary water is served via a spout inside the restaurant, bathrooms in a hallway right by the restaurant, and incredible sauces that you just can't pass up in a mini fridge. 

Food: Originally wanting tacos I found myself opting for this Kalbi California burrito. Kalbi meat prepared by the family's korean recipe, crispy tater tots, cheese and creama almost sounds a bit void of the usually ingredients in a burrito; in fact this is more of a loaded quesadilla in my opinion. BOMB! The sweetness of the meat, mixed with the crispiness of the tater tots with the smoothness of the cheese and cream create a wonderful combination.

Sauces: Green Sauce: Sweet, light, refreshing, and a good kick of cilantro. (My favorite)
Yellow Sauce: Sweet and very spicy, I warn you to be careful and only try when added to the food (also very good)
Red sauce: for next time!

Overall: A regular spot for me, lets grab lunch?"}
{"text":"This is a noble attempt at a great California inspired taco/burrito spot, but, sadly it lacks punch and value to be a destination worth going to.

Someone responsible for this location has done their homework.  The carne asada has a properly smokey flavor, the green salsa is very tasty, the ingredients in the burritos are appropriate to their inspiration, and the staff is pleasant.  These are the nice parts.

The trouble with this location is that the food just kinda sucks.  The burritos contain about 2oz of protein, and are pretty unsubstantial.  California and mission burritos should be the size of your forearm, these are about the size of a small Del Taco burrito.  The ratios of the burritos are way off,  Way too much cheese, way too little meat, and just poor execution all the way around.

This uninteresting food in coupled with a price tag that would accommodate much grander fare.  The price for what you get is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Over price tacos, I was expecting something more street style tacos, they were just plain"}
{"text":"They call it fusion, and that's exactly what it is. Don't expect super authentic Mexican food, but you can expect a nice twist that works. I usually get the California burrito with Kalbi or the Breakfast Burrito. The California burrito is nice because it has tater tots which give it a nice crunch, and if you get kalbi, the meat is slightly sweet and cooked well. 

Sauces/Salsa- They have 3 sauces/salsas that they keep in a mini fridge next to the water and iced tea. Just grab one out of the fridge, and take it to where you're sitting. They go by heat level, and my favorite is the middle salsa that's green. It has nice flavor, but it's not all that spicy which is kind of a bummer.

Drinks- If you check in on Yelp, there's a free agua fresca which is really generous imo. I really like the watermelon mint. It's refreshing on a hot Summer day. Water is from a little tap/faucet next to the iced tea, so it  might be easy to miss. It's really cute though!

My only complaint is that the seating inside isn't super plentiful, but you can always sit outside where there's tables w/ umbrellas. It's not a huge problem.

TLDR- it's decently priced, the food is good, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Love the food there ! 
Great menu from salads to my favorite avocado tostado.
If you want some quick and healthy Mexican food this is a great choice !! 
Wonderful customer service also :)"}
{"text":"Was a fan of Me Gusta Tacos at the district in Green Valley so I tried their new location ..  loved it and it was a great meal as per usual .  Very clean and great friendly service !!  A great spin on Mexican food !  A healthy meal with great taste !!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying mi gusta tacos. The place is small but charming. Coming from Los Angeles, tacos are indeed a comfort food and a nostalgic eating experience for me and my wife. We recently moved here and we really haven't found that taco eating experience yet. And unfortunately, mi gusta tacos didn't win us over completely. 

Before we get to my cons let's explore the pros! 
-the pork belly bahn mi taco is probably my favorite from what we ordered. 
-the pineapple basil Fresca was refreshing and delightful.
-the service is very friendly and patient, since this was my first time. 
-their salsas are flavorful, I personally like the salsa verde.
-the atmosphere is charming and indeed a hip place to dine. 

With so much good, I was surprised to find some not so good things with mi gusta tacos. 
-their rendition of a carne asada tacos just sort of missed my taste buds. It wasn't chopped up and grilled like I've grown to love my tacos. Grant it I know this is a fusion type of eatery, but it just was a little odd to eat a soft and mushy taco...
- the fish taco was bland, even with their wasabi crema
-the Korean kalbi, was indeed a significant let down, as the flavor rose to excite my taste buds, it left them wanting more...it was indeed an anticlimactic experience.
-I also got a California burrito, which had tater tots instead of French fries. I liked the idea, but again the sour cream, mild cheddar and the \"crunchy tater tots\" just fell flat on the flavor. It's was filling, but I wasn't satisfied. 

I think mi gusta tacos are taking steps in some bold directions. I appreciate this, but I feel some ideas look better on paper than in your mouth. I will definitely try them out again, solely for their super awesome service.

I give mi gusta tacos 3 stars. Hopefully, next time I'll be more in love with the taste of their food, over their amazing and inviting service."}
{"text":"One night last week my husband and I were looking for a quick dinner spot where we could enjoy our food outside. This spot popped up on my Yelp that day and I knew I wanted to try it out. 

I love The District so that alone makes it a great location in my books. I also like that it's near the splash pad so there are plenty of tables around to enjoy your food. 

The inside of the restaurant is simple and clean. There are about a dozen tables, but I'd recommend the tables outside on a nice day.

Orders are taken at the register and then brought out when they are ready. The employees were fine with finding everyone at the outside tables when orders were ready. The orders show up on a screen in front of the register so you can make sure your order is correct as you go. 

I had a trio of tacos with chips as my dinner. The Fish Taco tasted fresh and the wasabi crema had a nice taste. The cilantro loaded on a little too generously. The Shredded Pollo Taco was simple and delicious. The Charbroiled Carne Asada Taco was my favorite. The steak portion was generous and very well flavored. I tried the red and green salsa and wasn't thrilled with either, but the tacos were great as served. Overall, this was a tasty meal and not too heavy. 

Along with my tacos I enjoyed the Watermelon Mint Fresca and a Caramel Churro. The Fresca was light and refreshing. It can be spiked for a nice adult beverage as well. The Caramel Churro was really good and the perfect sweet ending to the meal. 

My husband had the Breakfast Burrito and if I had to rate on this alone I would be giving a two. The burrito said it came with green chile which is why my husband chose it, but the burrito didn't have any green chile to be found. It was just egg, cheese, and a ridiculous amount of cilantro. I have included a photo of the cilantro to show the cilantro overkill. The tots served on the side were completely forgettable. This item made me torn on what to rate this spot overall because I don't believe in restaurants serving foods that they can't do well. Fortunately, my tacos were awesome. 

There aren't a ton of taco spots in this area so I think this is a good spot for the area. Get the tacos and churros!"}
{"text":"Tried Me Gusta Tacos yesterday and it was great, I had the mission burrito, stacked totts and my wife had the pork belly and kalbi tacos. Highly recommend you try this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I love this place! Customer service is so great. He explains the whole menu and the sauces. My boyfriend got the California burrito with Korean kalbi in it. I couldn't get my hands off his plate. I will definitely be getting that next time."}
{"text":"Probably the best Taco/Burrito joint in Henderson/Las Vegas area. Really creative and the food is spot on. Went there looking for just a simple lunch and got so much more. The food quality, and the service were unbeaten. I would pick Me Gusta Tacos over chipotle or any main stream Mexican food place any day the food is just too good. Also the prices match any of those places but the taste exceeds those places. Please check this place out you won't regret it I guarantee it!"}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping and decided to get some food before we headed back to St. George Utah, this place was just around the corner. If you like tacos you'll love this place!! It was beyond anything we thought it would be. The Korean taco and the pork belly are both amazing! And the Green Salsa !! This place is so good My boyfriend could not stop talking about it on the two hr drive back home! We even debated driving back to Henderson just to get some more tacos!! The employees were so nice and available for anything we needed! They were super patient with us (we stared at the menu for 10 minutes before we could decided) everything just sounded so good and we could not decided! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 rating. Tacos are above average and good. Had the Kalbi, Asada, and the pork bahn. Asada was my favorite and the other two were good as well.

I expected a lot more coming from a 5 Star place, especially with a $3.5 per taco (or 3 for 9.50). This is a fancy taco place, good for once in a blue moon"}
{"text":"The carnitas Tacos was salty.  The pork belly chewy.   I liked the carne asada and Kali.  The seafood taco left a lot to be desired.  The tater tot nachos were excellent.  The best thing.  Corn with bacon not so good.  Overall, it was hit and miss.  No one in group found it excellent.  Everyone agree on so-so."}
{"text":"It was ok, but I wasn't blown away. My wife and I both got 3 taco plates with 3 different tacos each, so we tried 6 of their taco selections. If you are aiming for healthy, gluten free, etc, it's probably great. Add a star. But if you're just looking for delicious tacos and don't care about that other stuff, try Rubio's, Cafe Rio or someplace more authentic like Taco y Taco. They also have burrito's and a few other selections, so it's possible I'd like those things more, but they are supposedly known for their tacos, which I found mediocre. Most of the ones we tried were either one note flavors or the meat was dry and tough. The only one my wife and I both liked was the carnitas. 

My wife and I are big on ambience when we choose where to eat. This place has none. The inside is stark, brightly lit and uninviting. There is some seating outside by the splash pad in The District, which can be nice for families, but we don't have kids and don't particularly care for unsupervised children running amok and screaming in our faces while we are trying to enjoy a meal. Call me old fashioned, but there it is. 

I will give a nod to the service. Our server was great. When we didn't like the aqua fresca we tried, she gave us another flavor no charge. And when they accidentally gave our churro out with another order, they gave us two in it's place. For that reason alone, if I were in the district and in the mood for healthy, sustainable, responsible food, I'd try getting it to go and eating it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I had 3 tacos and the stacked tater tots.  Fish taco was a grilled white fish with wasabi cream, slaw, and cilantro.   I thought it was pretty good on a healthier play on a fish taco.  I used the habanero sauce on this one which paired nicely with the fish.  Even though the sauce is rated a 9 in heat level by Me Gusta, it was mild as far as hot sauces go.  Chicken taco was flavorful but unremarkable tbh.  I used the green sauce with this one.  Lastly I had the carne Asada taco where the beef was tender and it had a different flavor than your typical carne Asada.  I used the red sauce which is the most mild so I could taste the flavor of the beef better.  Tater tots were what you would expect with some guacamole, cheese, and sour cream.  Overall a good attempt in doing a slightly healthier Mexican concept with an Asian slant.  Clean fast-casual spot inside the District"}
{"text":"I came here for a meeting. The fusion was different interesting. Overall, the tacos were decent but nothing special. I enjoyed the carne asada best but everything else was pretty standard. I wasn't too impressed. The sauces and drinks they made were unique but left you wondering if they were trying too hard."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!   Very fresh food.  The interior of the restaurant is small and quaint.  There are plenty of tables and seats outside.  The 3 salsa choices are amazing!  I can't say enough good things about this place that we just stumbled upon.  I want to go back again tomorrow!!!  A must in Henderson!   Please go and try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey great for take out or eat in!!  Really like the fish and Korean tacos.  And a great cold modello beer.  Great flavor and super staff and service provided."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place. The customer service was the best. The food was so good. We had the California burrito and it was amazing! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's an Asian-Mex fusion place and we loved it! It was our first time here and we have a lot of people so we shared different tacos and nachos. I have to say my favorites so far were the bahn mi and carnitas tacos. The carnitas were rubbed in like cinnamon or something and that habanero salsa was the perfect addition."}
{"text":"Ordered taco trio, fish/carne asada/Korean. My food took forever to come out the two other people I was with got their food right away. Maybe it was because I ordered a fish taco and it had to be fried. Tacos come with chips (not a lot) I ordered a side of guacamole and a drink. $18.00 later which is a bit much for lunch. The taco are street tacos (small) best taco was the Korean taco.they have a fridge with fresh made salsa the green is the best. Food and service was good. Probably won't go back until I get paid again.
FOLLOW UP-check your account they charged me twice for the same meal and the owner won't return my call! It happened to my friend I was with also!"}
{"text":"We got the veggie burrito(with chips) and a black bean salad and both were delicious.  You can choose from a few salsas.  Topped them off with a cerveza.  Best of all, we could eat outside and watch the toddlers run through the sprinklers at The District.  Really a fun place, especially if you plan it to coincide with The District's outdoor entertainment (a guitarist the day we went).  Add in good service, to boot!"}
{"text":"Very very impressed with the food. I got the carne asada nachos, must say very filling. Great portion of chips, meat, guacamole and salsa.

My husband ordered the 3 tacos, he said very filling also, meat was cook to perfection. His favorite was the kbbq!

They have 3 different side sauces which were amazing, my favorite was the habenero.

As for the place, perfect location for me since it's down the street from my house. Very cute little restaurant with a selfie mirror. Lol. Also the costumer service was great for our first time the cashier explained the whole menu to us.

The only down side was the prices, $10 for 3 mini tacos.. a bit out of range. But I'll def be back on pay days to catch me another bite."}
{"text":"Super delicious food that's right near the splash pad. Allows my husband and I to enjoy a nice,  casual dinner while our son plays outside. Great addition to The District.."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite taco spot. Although it isn't only a taco spot. The food is top quality, the service impeccable and the place provides a bright, fresh atmosphere.
Their reasonably priced menu offers an array of items that cater to the most difficult palates and restricted diets - from Pork Belly Bahn Mi tacos, which everyone I bring here loves, to Vegetarian Tacos, which I love, to their Me Gusta Bowls (just try it!). Everything I've ever tried here is flawlessly prepared and delicious!

Sin lugar a dudas, este es mi sitio para tacos favorito. Aunque no es sólo para tacos. La comida es de suprema calidad, el servicio impecable y el sitio tiene un ambiente fresco y alegre.
Su menú abarca una variedad de platos, todos a precios razonables, los cuales acomodan el paladar más difícil y la dieta más restringida. Tienen desde Pork Belly Bahn Mi's, lo cuales les encantan a todo el que traigo aquí, hasta tacos vegetarianos, ¡los cuales me encantan a mí!, y también los Me Gusta Bowls (¡sólo pruébalo!). ¡Todo lo que he probado aquí ha estado preparado a la perfección y delicioso!"}
{"text":"How dare other people give this restaurant anything less than 5 stars?!?!?! 
We stumble upon this place looking for frozen yogurt and my goodness! What a great find! The food is amazing! i had their me gusta bowl with chicken and mango salsa, the most amazing \"healthy\" food i ever had! Don't leave without trying the caramel churro as well..

Oh and the pineapple basil is so refreshing and not sweet at all, my type of drink.. 

I fell too fast and feel too much, its my first time here and this place has become an instant favorite! The owner talked to us and seems like a nice guy! Will totally be supporting this local business.."}
{"text":"This place is great! The Me Gusta bowl and Carne Asada tacos are my favorites! The staff is friendly and service is fast! They have outdoor seating by the splash pad. They make new drinks everyday, including chia lemonade, orange juice, and horchata. Overall this place is delicious and a great addition to the district."}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place a few weeks ago and I know she loves it as I have to go get her office lunch here weekly! The carnitas are rich in flavor and I would recommend spicing it up with the mango sauce. My wife really loves the veggie tacos because it's such a unique flavor! My only complaint is their tater tots aren't gluten free as they only have one fryer but that is pretty common issue!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had in my life. If I could eat here everyday I would. Just order the tacos and let your kids run wild on the splash pad right outside the restaurant! Only complaint is the luke warm tap water for water cups, but they have cold bottled water if you want."}
{"text":"Nothing special,taste is ok location is clean the salsa verity is really nice any super fresh but the tacos are ok not Supreme-and they don't have grilled chicken.overall cool place to eat"}
{"text":"Order Kalbi,Ban mi and Fish tacos, had pineapple basil fresca it was very refreshing Kalbi taco and fish was really good Ban mi kinda chewy overall it was very good tacos great customer service A place to check out."}
{"text":"I love the delicious simplicity of this Taco Restaurant. The service is top notch, the food is fresh and perfectly prepared each time. I don't live near but I stop by every time I'm in Green Valley! Excellence is rare, so grateful for the excellence you serve up!"}
{"text":"Wow... simple and delicious. Clean atmosphere, fresh salsas and great tacos. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Really good fusion tacos. Service is fast and friendly. The workers are very helpful and knowledgeable. I had the Bahn Mi taco which has Vietnamese elements in it such as pickled carrots and bbq pork. Yum! The carne asda taco was fresh and flavorful. I also ordered the carne asada nachos and the chips were fresh and not. There are squeezee bottles with red hot sauce and green hot sauce. Both were mild to me but added some heat. The place is very clean and a good crowd shows up quick. Will definitely be coming back to try some agua frescas."}
{"text":"We used Me Gusta for a catering order for 32 people and EVERYONE loved it! 
It was awesome- Kalbi beef, shredded chicken, rice, beans, Tater tots, corn with bacon, pineapple basil Fresca and chips with salsa. I'm still thinking about it!! Going back this week to take my husband."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Me Gusta Tacos. The restaurant was spotless and the service was friendly, helpful, and efficient. 

My wife and I tried the California and the Mission burritos, both with carne asada. Both were delicious. The carne asada has good flavor with a nice char and the meat was of noticeably higher quality than you typically get at Mexican fast food. The tater tots in the California burrito were crunchy and a nice change from french fries. The tortillas come crispy/well done which is my favorite way for burritos.  

It was a little more than I typically spend on burritos, but the increase in the quality of the food was definitely noticeable.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our go to eatery when we're in the GVR area. A little more pricey for burritos and tacos, however the fusion and quality make it worth the travel and money. Their motto is \"make simple better\" and it's so fitting for me gusta tacos! The meat (I've only tried kalbi and carne asada) is so fresh and tender. Putting Tator tots and Kalbi together is genius! I've pretty much had all the burritos besides the breakfast ones. They're a little small compared to usual burritos but very fulfilling and so good. Oh and don't even get me started with the agua de frescas! All of them are good and so refreshing. Overall the menu is very simple but quality worth and the staff there really helps caters your needs"}
{"text":"This place is yummy and their aguas frescas are never to disappoint. The pineapple basil is so great! The people working here are very sweet and helpful. I like their salsa selection too!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this place. I ordered the Carnitas meat on my loaded tater tots and when I receive them the dish was sweet so I asked what the sweet component was and was told it was a cinnamon rub on the pork. Well I do not like sweet and savory together so I was truly disappointed and only eat a few bites. My daughter ordered the carne asada on her salad and the meat was flavored more like Mediterranean then Mexican food. We were expecting authentic Mexican food and the spices just did not pair well with the dishes. If it's not going to be traditional then maybe you should tell people I could have been allergic to Cinnamon I would never think to ask if cinnamon was going to be in carnitas."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy...... first time in this cute clean little restaurant. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I tried  three different tacos. Loved the carne asada and the vegetable. Will  definitely return  for more. Also tried the fresca."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day. The service behind the counter was friendly. I thought the food was delicious and so was the tea. I would definitely come here again! A++"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go eat here in the Rhodes Ranch area. :) Best tacos and service in town. Plenty of tables and chairs. Very clean inside. A++"}
{"text":"Was driving back to the Vegas strip from the Hoover dam and found this place on yelp. A great spot!!! We tried 5 different tacos and the nachos and all were excellent and fresh. Would totally check this place out if you the close by."}
{"text":"Just moved here from California, and I was out exploring at GVR. Stumbled across this gem in my state of hunger. I'm glad I did. Food has a fresh, healthy, quality feel to it. It hit the spot, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pineapple basil Agua fresca was great and a must Try. The staff was very friendly. We ordered the chicken California burrito, comes with  shredded chicken, tots, and cheddar (way too much cheddar)  The burrito was just awful. Maybe because we came too late an hr before closing but the chicken and tots tasted old and were cold inside a grilled tortilla . The shrimp burrito was ok but the shrimp was way to fishy for me. The salsas and chips were fresh and pretty good."}
{"text":"Way overpriced, not even that good, 10 dollars for a small burrito or 3 small tacos with no rice or beans, gimme a break.Tried it twice because I was hoping to have a better experience based on other yelp reveiws, don't know how this place is highly rated."}
{"text":"So delicious. Found this place online. Came over to the district just to try it out for lunch. Yummy. Love the unique dishes. Staff is lovely. Ambiance is peaceful right near the outside area."}
{"text":"My 2nd time back and was pretty excited for the pork belly burrito. It was pretty delicious, goes well with the salsa verde. Sad thing is they charge for refills. Can't  wait to come back for the kobi tacos."}
{"text":"Great fusion of Asian & Mexican deliciousness! The employees here are very friendly & very helpful. My family shared a bunch of different menu items; kalbi quesadilla, kalbi California burrito, pork belly tacos, a strawberry lemonade fresca & a shrimp burrito. Everything tasted amazing, especially the shrimp burrito. Tons of flavor! We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Nice area and vibe. The food was ok. A lot of cumin spice on carne asada. I ordered a burrito which came with chips and an agua Fresca. $13.00. The agua fresca was very good. The size of the burrito was like a taco. Servings are very small compared to the price. My friend ordered 3 tacos and a drink and it was $16 and tacos were small as well."}
{"text":"Loved the concept, but didn't deliver for us. We drove across town to try and brought our kids for the splash pad. The location is great.   Flavor wise I just didn't love it and we probably wouldn't come back.  I liked the idea of adding in the tots but flavors just didn't wow me, kind of had no flavor."}
{"text":"Me gusta tacos was a yes for me! I was craving Mexican food one day but didn't feel like going to Roberto's so I browsed on yelp and me gusta popped up! It's still fairly new located in the vons shopping center where the old Pho place used to be next to at&t. When we arrived we were greeted by 2 very friendly ladies. They are always personable and very professional with all guests. There is a wide variety of burritos and tacos. I prefer the California burrito with carne asada over any other meat. I tried the shrimp last time and it was meh, very underwhelming. My friends always get the tator tots with guac and sour cream which are really good. Everything is fresh and made to order unlike Roberto's who serves less than mediocre carne asada. There hot sauces are fresh and spicy and have a way more sanitary set up, they're all in a mini fridge. Not sitting under ice in a messy buffet style display. I've never been let down or disappointed here. I was dissatisfied with the shrimp burrito last time I came and asked the lady working if I could change it to my usual and she was very accommodating and didn't get an attitude about me sending it back. That's what customer service is all about and me gustas nailed it! Don't forget to check in and receive a free complimentary tea. The hibiscus and strawberry are the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Ubereats tonight. 4 tacos and nachos. Tacos were good but in the nachos was a long strand of hair. Absolutely disgusting. Your employees should be wearing hair nets. Seriously. Never ordering from this place again."}

{"text":"Love going to this place! I always get there pork belly California burrito with their green sauce. It's amaaaazzzzing!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place but got let down tremendously..I ordered the me Gusta bowl with shrimp ..I was charged $16 for my meal
That had 5 shrimp total and load of red cabbage..wtf !! It was my first time and when I was asking for the size and more Information on the food  it was more like an inconvenience for the cashier to explain. Ok no thanks ..lesson learned 
Pretentious taco shop who up sells their product cause they have quinoa on the menu.

{"text":"We looked this place up on Yelp while visiting from California and it did not disappoint.  
I love California Burritos so when I saw theirs on the menu with CRUNCHY TATER TOTS, and KALBI as a choice of meat...throw in some GUAC, I was sold.
It looked like a small portion when I got it but it was actually really filling for me. I couldn't even finish the whole thing (but I am a tiny person, so it doesn't take much to fill me).  The price is affordable too.
Also, the free Agua Fresca from checking in on Facebook was delicious. I stuck with the basic strawberry lemonade. 
The workers were very friendly too.
I would definitely recommend this place and would totally come back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 4-5 times now and really enjoy the simplicity and flavors of this place.

1. Burritos - mainly came here for the burritos and had both the California, Anthem and Mission Burrito over several times.

California - Had both the carnitas and the kalbi burrito of this and it is very fresh and tasty.

Anthem - This is more of a vegetarian style burrito with beans, cheese and avocado and squash.  Also tasty, you really don't miss the mean and my daughter makes this her Vegan favorite by cutting out the cheese.

2.  Beer and Wine - Yes, I enjoy having a glass of beer or wine at times with my dinner and it is great that they have a license.  You can sit in or outside and enjoy the weather, the water park, the kids playing, the band when there is one, and eat, drink and be merry.

3.  The weather - We all know in summer it can get hot.  The best thing is that in the mornings, Me Gusta is positioned on the west side and they get a lot of shade, so it can still be very nice and pleasant to enjoy and relax.

4.  Agua Fresca - Interestingly, they have fresh water mixed with fruit, mint and these are very refreshing!  I have tried a few of their flavors. They make them fresh and they change it up and if you want a very cold and refreshing drink that is healthy, check it out!

If you are a meat eater, or a vegetarian, this is a place that has options for you  and they can make it your way. 

GK Says, check it out.  It is one of our favorite places now!"}
{"text":"The shrimp burrito was amazing! Also the guys at the counter were very helpful to me and my girlfriend as she has some dietary restrictions, and they helped us choose alternatives. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"READ ME FIRST:  I'm going to save you a trip and let you know that this restaurant doesn't serve Mexican style street tacos.  Instead it's a fusion type of restaurant.  If you're expecting delicious greasy Mexican tacos POR FAVOR look elsewhere.  

Ok so now that that's out of the way... We ordered the 3 taco plate as well as a California burrito.  They have a variety of meats to choose from but we wanted the classics and chose carne asada, barbacoa, and carnitas. They also have Asian style tacos like banh mi etc.  

It was a pleasant surprise to receive the tacos and there wasn't any grease or oil on the plate.  You get the feeling that you're eating clean, and well, that's about the only good thing about the tacos.  They just... lacked salt and flavor.  So naturally I grab the 3 salsas to add some flavor.  I don't think I've ever had salsas as bad as these.  They just didn't taste traditional.  The salsa verde was so off tasting and it's just upsetting because it's so simple to make... tomatillos, chilis, cilantro and salt. I don't know how you can screw that up but they did.  The other two salsas were forgettable as well but I had to choose the red salsa as it was the only decent salsa out of the three.

On the bright side, the burrito was fantastic!  They use tator tots instead of fries and I loved the crunchiness of the tots.  The burrito just needed salt but other than that it was good as is.  

The agua frescas aren't flavorful and actually I didn't see horchata or tamarindo.  They have real fruit/veggie juices but since there was a lack of sugar I just didn't drink them.  The chips also lacked salt.

All in all I won't be coming back.  I love authentic Mexican and I also enjoy Americanized Mexican food but this wasn't good at either.  Salsas are a good indicator of how good a restaurant will be and if I was offered tortilla chips at the beginning and realized how bad the salsas were, I would left a tip and walked out.  DO try the California burrito, and don't forget to add salt."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! The carnitas is made with a cinnamon garlic marinade and it's slow cooked. Really brings out the taste. The ceviche has a hint of spice but it's not over powering, the avocado and cucumbers balances it out. Overall great food and great experience."}
{"text":"So here we are, 4 hours since lunch, and my wife is still gushing over how delicious and how much she enjoyed her Nachos.  If I was insecure, I'd be worried. 

The Nachos were a tasty, perfect, blend of chips, sharp cheese, Black Beans, diced tomatoes, sour cream and a generous portion of homemade Guacamole.   Altogether, the Nachos were a healthy combination of texture and flavors.

I had three tacos.  They are \"street taco\" size, but if you're expecting a hole-in-the-wall, greasy taco, you're going to be disappointed.  

These tacos are a fresh and modern take on an Old World favorite.  I had Carnitas, Korean and Fish.  The corn tortillas were soft and pliable. The meat and their appropriate spice blend were tasty. The cabbage or other greens were crisp, fresh, and in the correct ratio to the taco size.  

Though a bit on the costlier side, the food here is worth every cent.  This isn't a place to gorge yourself because you're starving.  It's a place to enjoy excellent Modern Mexican cuisine. 

I'll be back on a regular basis for sure!"}
{"text":"Okay so let's start with no horchata.. bummer :( 

I ordered the nachos with just beans, cheese, sour cream, and guac along with a korean taco. The korean taco was amazing! This along with the friendly staff are the only reason they are getting 3 stars instead of 1. The nachos were burnt like you could see black on the chips around the edges. There was hardly any cheese?? Nachos need a lot of cheese!! I honestly couldn't believe they brought out burnt nachos... the black chips didn't make them think twice I guess? Definitely going to avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"New place by the house + I LOVE Mexican food =FANTASTICO!!

Healthy and delish options, you can tell it's better quality of food and the staff is super friendly and kind. They have happy hour 4-6pm which is cool and the Agua Fresca was OUT OF THIS WORLD!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant while staying in Henderson. My family tried the anthem burrito, carne Asada taco, and mission burrito. All of the food tasted fresh and simple. I would highly recommend this place for  anyone who is looking for a fresh Mexican meal that has a healthy spin. It was filling but not greasy! Their vegetarian option (the anthem) was flavorful and filling. I would highly recommend the freshly made churros! The customer service was also great - they checked on us frequently and allow us to sample the agua frescas. My only suggestions would be to have a few more salsa options and fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Oh my goshhhh this place is amazing!! Okay where do I start... first off the place is so cute when you walk in! The tiles on the wall were the first thing that caught my eye, they are so cute! The place is very clean and the staff every time we have gone in are very cool and friendly... The prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing! If you are looking for some good mexican food THIS IS YOUR PLACE!! Stop searching on Yelp right now for where to eat and come here! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is just as good as their first location! The food is delicious and the service is amazing! Such a great spot to come and eat and hangout. If you haven't checked it out yet you're missing out!! Mmm talking about this place makes me hungry! Hahahah!"}
{"text":"What a GREAT addition to the Rhodes Ranch community shopping center. I had never even heard of Me Gusta Tacos and had since learned they have one in the district in Henderson as well. The food is very fresh. The Korean tacos are unique and like nothing I have had before. They are great... They also have barvarian cream filled churros which are a must. The salsa is in bottles and the habanero one is pretty hot which is great. It is an interesting idea to not have a salsa bar and have the salsa's in bottles. It somewhat keeps it more sanitary to me though and I like the idea. Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Who cares if this is fusion Mexican food? It's food and great food at that. I can appreciate great food and great customer service. They made it a point to ask if i have ate here before when I walked up to the counter and welcomed me to ask questions if I needed to. I explained that I found there food page on \"@lasvegasfoodie\" on Instagram and had sent that page to my friend in Oregon to help make a decision for me! I'm glad I decided to come here. I was bummed to hear the Watermelon Mint agua fresca was sold out but after free samples I opted for the Strawberry Lemonade agua fresca. It only seemed right for this Californian to try the California Burrito: crunchy tater tots, mild cheddar, sour cream, with chicken and the added guacamole was a hit. I thought the chicken would be pieces and not shredded but it wasn't enough to disappoint me. Food is great, and people on here dissing fusion Mexican food should keep more of an open mind!"}
{"text":"I'll give 2 stars for the service, which was great! The food I would give 0 stars. I had high hopes after reading the other reviews and receiving an email threw Yelp. I am sad to say the food was just not good at all! I ordered the chicken tacos which looked good when they came out but fell apart when you pick them up and the flavor was just blah. Rice was horrible!!! Looked like white rice with absolutely no flavor. I've never had a Mexican rice that was so bad! My husband ordered a steak burrito. He said literally everywhere else has better burritos then this place. And for $28 it definitely was not worth it. Your better off going to a robertos. I have no idea how they stay in business. I left feeling disappointed and ripped off."}
{"text":"We had the California burrito and added pico de gallo and guacamole. So good! Their ingredients taste so fresh and their sauces are so yummy! Love that there's a Mexican fusion place in this area now!"}
{"text":"Always welcoming, always fresh, always delicious. A fail-safe, go-to taco spot. Theyve got it all in terms of their selection of protein. While I dont eat pork, I can vouch their chicken and barbacoa are on-point. I loved that they offer korean kalbi, but it's a little too sweet (like beef jerky sweet) for my liking. But, others may dig it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The black bean salad is so yummy and the dressing is to die for. Going to be a regular on my local restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  Too pricey for a little serving.  Better go to Robertos OR Don Tortaco...."}
{"text":"Place is great. Had to try all the churros. They do have fillings in them. Yes they do have tacos. All the sauces are on the side and excellent. Very reasonable price. Great for the kids while they are in the splash pad. I do recommend this place just asking you try the churros, better then the one in Disneyland . And way cheaper!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a five star experience like most reviewers, but I don't think I'll be back. I like the location, but I'd venture out of my 'hood to get some good tacos and burritos. 

The small-ish tacos were $3.50 each or 3 for $9.50. Carnitas was salty and had just a sliver of avocado. Kalbi was on the dry side. Fish taco tasted fresh and I liked the wasabi. My husband thought his taco meal was very \"meh.\"

I was most excited for the California burrito, which traditionally comes with carne asada and fries at other taco joints. At Me Gusta Tacos, they use tater tots! I got mine with kalbi. The only other things in the burrito were cheese and a tiny amount of sour cream. Overall, the burrito was very dry. Even the house made sauces did not help it. Luckily, I had some avocado at home that I added along with some plain Greek yogurt (did not have sour cream at home).

Ordered my child a quesadilla kids meal ($4). Total regret. I could've made this better at home. It was sad. He took a couple bites and we tossed it. It wasn't worth saving as leftovers. For future reference, please put more cheese in it.

Another disappointment was that horchata was not on the beverage menu, since it was mentioned in the tips section on Yelp. Por qué?!?

{"text":"I LOVE this place... my favorite is the black bean salad with chicken!! The cilantro salsa goes perfect with it too. Whenever I'm at the District, I make sure to grab a bite here!! Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Korean taco is bomb, carnitas just ok.  Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I have to hand it to them. Best surf and turf burrito I had in my best! High quality food for a reasonable price, you just can't beat that! I got the California burrito with added shrimp and guac and boy did it hit the spot.
The regular Cali burrito was like $8 something but with added shrimp and gauc, it came out to be around $15. (It was totally worth it)
They have 3 levels of salsas in the small fridge by the drinking fountain. Make sure to try all three of them!!  

This place is freaking amazing.... Wish they were out in California for my friends to try.. 

It's a causal clean hip Mexican restaurant overall.

They serve breakfast burritos as well as tacos! Can't be mad..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The portions were the perfect size and the ingredients were super fresh. We had the Mission burritos and they were AMAZING. The pork belly tacos and shrimp ceviche were also really good. We will definitely be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Me Like, You Like, We both like Tacos!!!!!
Me Gusta Tacos delivers on providing mouth watering and healthy tacos. 
In my opinion, they are serious contenders that puts them near the top of my list as one of the best tacos in town.  They also have enticing breakfast menu as well and is served all day. 

I ordered a variety of tacos, all these were really delicious on there own.  The one commonality is the food tastes fresh and juicy. They make handmade soft corn tortillas, and the best salsas. You cannot eat a taco without salsa here, your missing out!!! 
I recommend the Salsa Verde and the Habanero if you like spicy.  

KOREAN KALBI - Korean Steak, Asian Cabbage Slaw
SHREDDED POLLO - Chicken, Cheddar, Pico de Gallo, Avocado
FISH - Sustainable Fish, Cabbage, Cilantro, Wasabi Crema
CARNE ASADA - Traditional Marinated Steak, Pico de Gallo, Queso Fresco
If had to pick a favorite its the Korean Kalbi - Korean BBQ in a form of a taco, my I can't resist that.

Say your in the mood for something sweet? The Venezuelan Chocolate Pancakes is heavenly and will satisfy your craving, just look at the picture. 

Overall, this is a shot of adrenaline that Henderson needed. It's in a beautiful spot in the district, where people can relax and enjoy. Plus, the staff are pleasant and provide great customer service. Just by walking in,  wouldn't think they just opened. 

I highly recommend checking out Me Gusta Tacos!"}
{"text":"You know what they say the food the doesn't lie. Me Gusta Tacos continues to thrive with their freshly made tacos and burritos. Now with the grand opening their second location near Durango & 215 more people can enjoy this delicious food. 

Today I ate the Mission Burrito the skinny version which is without the tortilla basically a nacho bowl with choice of meat, cheese, salsa and rice. Barbcoa tasted bomb, very tender and juicy. I made sure to mix everything up to get full flavor of everything. 

This shop is twice as big than the other location, kitchen and dining space. They'll need it, lots of foot traffic are over here. 

I'm so happy these guys are doing well I wish them further success."}
{"text":"This kind of place is EXACTLY what the District needed. High quality, affordable and quick modern Mexican cuisine. 

I tried the Carne Asada, Carnitas and Korean Kalbi tacos. All three were phenomenal- seriously some of the best proteins I've ever had. I also enjoyed their salad and guacamole. 

This is the kind of place that will keep me from going to Chipotle ever again... 

I highly recommend trying this place before it gains too much popularity in the District because it's definitely going to happen! Killer job Me Gusta!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The husband and wife team, Sandra and Li have done a wonderful job creating a popular restaurant in the District in Henderson, which was crowded, even when not the tables outside, after only 9 days of being open. 
The menu is well thought out, with all day breakfast, and a balanced selection of other dishes to choose from, including many vegetarian selections, some using sustainable fish, non-gmo ingredients, and other good stuff, make this a definite place to try for a meal."}
{"text":"I don't normally wrote lengthy reviews, but I must say this place hands down is in my favorites list..
I ordered the 3 tacos korean kalbi and carne asada, and chips. The tacos had so much flavor and were very tasty, I don't live on this side of town but when leaving work I will make sure to stop by for a good meal..I highly recommend anyone if they haven't to try this place out.."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience all around. Everything was made to order and tased phenomenal. There was a mistake made to our order that I noticed when the food was brought out, and the staff worked quickly to fix it and even comped a drink after the mistake was fixed. The gesture was very appreciated and will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"We drove from Summerlin all the way to Henderson for these tacos! They did not disappoint! We tried all of the tacos on the menu! I appreciate the hospitality shown and the care taken to blen cultures together to make AWESOME tacos! Sorry no pics we are them to fast."}
{"text":"I have been to this place on two different occasions and have tired their tacos and burrito so far ---- and they are delicious! I have tried the  Pork Belly Banh Mi, Charbroiled Carne Asada, and Korean Kalbi tacos so far and I got to say that my favorite is the Pork Belly. As for burritos, I have tried the shrimp burrito and it is the best shrimp burrito I have ever tasted. The shrimp's seasoning definitely gives me a Vietnamese take and I absolutely love the Mexican-Asian fusion available on their menu. Will definitely stop by again and again to try out their other items."}
{"text":"It's a good little spot. Steak Korean tacos were tasty. It is a little pricey though for what you get. Staff is friendly. I would go back again."}
{"text":"My favorite new taco shop!!!  A perfect place to find a satisfying vegetarian meal  if it's your first time remember to check in on yelp for a free drink!"}
{"text":"This place has some good fresh wholesome tasting food. This to me is sort of a modern twist on Mexican flavors and they deliver on some good fusion. I've had both bowls and tacos with almost all the meats, barbacoa is ok and same with the chicken, but kalbi in my opinion has the most flavor. The me gusta bowl is delicious and you can choose your meat and comes with avocado and red cabbage and mango which adds a nice sweetness. They also make delicious churros that are the perfect texture. Overall pretty solid stuff, almost perfect.       4.5/5"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while walking around Town Square.  Since it was a while before we were meeting our friends for lunch, we decided to stop in and share some tacos.  We chose the 3 tacos for $9.50: Carnitas, barbacoa, Korean Kalbi.  All of the were really good!  The salsa choices were really tasty as well.  Worth trying out if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Wow. Kalbi cali burrito is delish! Crunchy tots are substituted for fries.  Definitely an affordable place to stop by for some quick Mexican-Korean fusion while you're in The District.

Pineapple Basil agua fresca may not be everyone's favorite but still a must try."}
{"text":"First time going here and we will definitely be back. The place is super clean, the menu is diverse and the food was amazing. Fresh ingreidients, I got the shrimp burrito and it had plenty of shrimp that was well seasoned, cilantro, rice and a great sauce. The guy taking our order gave recommendations and was very friendly. Support our local businesses!!! We are now huge fans, can't wait to try the vegetarian options. We got 3 burritos and 2 churros, left an 18% tip and it was 39 bucks. Not del taco prices but you get what you pay for and we really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I'm so Canadian that seeing Spanish on store names, products, and signs still have that novelty feel. I expect to see French...not that I speak it either. But I have fun google translating the Spanish and I definitely agree with Me Gusta Tacos. 

I was lured in here through Instagram and the California Burrito with the kalbi ribs and tater tots. We literally drove from one end of the city to the other to try this menu. They did NOT disappoint! They were very helpful and had patience for us to ask about the menu first (which is rare and must be super annoying). Now, I love tater tots, but these were the BEST tater tots I ever had. The Stacked Tater Tots were amazing! The California Burrito was delicious and the kalbi was flavorful, such a perfect combo. Definitely try their agua frescas to wash your meal down, like the Watermelon Mint. The Churros are MUST and a take home treat, because you WILL leave here stuffed. And when midnight hits and you are standing in front of the fridge looking for snacks, you will be disappointed you didn't take the churros to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! 

Ordered the Korean Kalbi Tacos, Pollo Tacos, Venezuelan pancakes and Stacked Tater Tots.... Mmmm mmmm mmmmmmm!!!! Ingredients are so fresh, everything well seasoned and so simple but delicious! I will definitely be coming back for more~~~ service and ambiance is a 5 star as well!"}
{"text":"Got a California burrito with barbacoa and a mission burrito with carne Asada. Also got loaded tater tots. The food was nothing special."}
{"text":"Impressive tacos! We got the pork belly, carne, and fish tacos ( kept simple with lots of flavor). All were fabulous including their pineapple basil drink and street corn. Restraunt was very clean and nice vibes. Service from several employees were all great. Would recommend!"}

Now open for 19 months at The District at Green Valley Ranch and recently expanding westward to 7425 South Durango Drive just across the road from Glazier's it was for lunch on Friday that a visit was made to Me Gusta Tacos, the clean and spacious build-out from a prior occupant giving the place a somewhat sterile feel that is quickly remedied by friendly service.

Best described as fusion, the ownership previously involved with Rachel's Kitchen deciding to expand their fresh and healthy eating portfolio to Mexican food given an eastern twist, guests entering Me Gusta Tacos will immediately find themselves greeted by a pair of servers who offer to help first-timers navigate a menu divided into several sections with Tacos front and center, seven types of Meat plus a Vegetarian option made daily on site in addition to three styles of Salsa made \"at least twice a day\" depending on demand.

Joining the quick-casual movement that many diners seem to enjoy white keeping lights bright and offering both an \"I love Tacos\" mirror as well as wall signage for Instagrammers, it is after payment that patrons are given a number and offered the choice of high-tops or standard seating, a spot at the window overlooking the parking lot selected with food arriving in less than five minutes, a housemade Agua Fresca proving very clean and herbal without a lot of unnecessary sweetness. 

Changing up beverages daily, though the best-selling Pineapple-Basil is apparently a mainstay, it was as baskets were delivered that squeeze bottles of Salsa were additionally offered, the flavors bold and descriptions of spice level entirely accurate despite the fact that labels were accidentally switched around with both the Roja and Verde compelling enough to warrant eating two accompanying orders of crispy Tortilla Chips.

Starting off three Tacos, a $9.50 value with Chips as each Taco is individually sold for $3.50 otherwise, it was in an attempt to sample as widely as possible that the tasting got started with shredded Pollo topped in Pico de Gallo, Cheddar and Avocado, the flavor of the Chicken unfortunately a little overwhelmed by the toppings though this certainly was not an issue for the spicy Barbacoa and tangy Kalbi with both cuts of Beef tender, moist and nicely accentuated by their condiments.

Equally intrigued by the Burritos as by the Tacos and Bowls, everything available in a healthy or Gluten-friendly version by way of simply removing the Tortilla, it was after some debate between Mission or California-style that the latter was selected, Queso Fresco subbed for Sour Cream making the housemade Tots stand out even more boldly in terms of texture while the slow-cooked pork was aromatic and succulent.

Rounding out the afternoon with one of three Churros, a version filled with Caramel selected over Bavarian Cream or traditional Cinnamon and Sugar for no particular reason, suffice it to say that those who've experienced Churros in Mexico City or Barcelona will likely be unimpressed by the texture as oil penetrates deep, thus making everything a bit too heavy, though the flavor itself is as sweet and decadent as the ingredients would make one suspect.

****Not claiming to be \"authentic\" in any way, the focus instead on quality ingredients and preparations that can be adjusted to fit most dietary restrictions, Me Gusta Tacos offers another locally owned and healthy option for those seeking an affordable lunch or dinner option in the rapidly developing Southwest."}
{"text":"Definitely a place you have to try if you want a bit of a flair. Went in today after seeing the reviews.

Its a small little place inside the district in Henderson. What we ordered: the 6 tacos for $18 (pork belly, korean kalbi, carne asada, and barbacoa). All the tacos fully loaded, with the right seasoning. The pork belly and kalbi, soft and tender which also gave off a sweet taste. They also sell burritos, seafood options, and desserts. 

We also both checked in and got a free agua fresca on one order. Best part is, affordable and better than other taco food chain place in town.

Next up, the bavarian churros. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"YUUUUUUMM

I've been here only twice and haven't even tried the tacos yet, so this review is solely for the shrimp and Cali burritos. Let me tell you, this place DE-LI-VERS. No, they don't actually deliver food, but they deliver in FLAVORS. I've been living in Southern California for the last 11 years, so getting Mexican food anywhere outside of that area is hard to beat. HOWEVER,  the Cali burrito at Me Gusta Tacos is to die for. It is legit. The menu is \"fusion\" in the sense you can choose Korean meats like galbi for your food. The aguas frescas here are amazing too! They honor the Yelp check-in, so don't forget to pair 1 free agua fresca with your delicious food! Service is usually fast too.  This is easily the best eatery at The District. :D"}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious and the vibe is totally chill. The space inside is a little small for my own taste but the food makes up for it. I got the 3/9.50 tacos and enjoyed all of them. The ingredients were fresh and paired together well. They include chips with all the meals but the salsa is hidden in a refrigerator over in the corner. They have 3 different heat levels, all of which are slightly more mild than what they're rated, at least in my opinion."}
{"text":"Mi Gusta is located in The District, next to the water play feature.  Been meaning to try this place forever because of the ALL NATURAL MEATS, SUSTAINABLE FISH & REAL FRUIT AGUA FRESCA.


As soon as you walk in, granted there is no line, you get greeted by the friendly staff.  You walk up and order and take a number to your seat.  Seating is limited inside, since it's a smaller place.  But granted the weather is nice, they do have outdoor seating.   

This place gets busy, especially on the weekends, since families enjoy the water feature as well as the good eats.  

Let's get to the good stuff:  THE FOOD.

TACOS:

CARNITAS
Marinated Slow Cooked Pork, Pico de Gallo, Avocado



PORK BELLY BANH MI
Grilled Pork Belly, Vietnamese Slaw, Cilantro
The luscious pork belly and the sweet and salty pickled slaw went perfectly together.  One of my faves! 

BARBACOA
Slow Cooked Shredded Beef, Diced Onion, Cilantro
Pretty good.  Wanted more of a kick.  So with the addition of their yummy sauces it was on point.

KOREAN KALBI
Marinated Korean Steak, Asian Cabbage Slaw
Another one of my favorites.  Who doesn't love a bit of ko-mex fusion!!

CHARBROILED CARNE ASADA
Traditional Marinated Steak, Pico de Gallo, Queso Fresco
This one was a but disappointing.  Not as bold as the other tacos.  

FISH
Sustainable Fish, Cabbage, Cilantro, Wasabi Crema
Tender fish with he crispy cabbage, very good fish taco.  

*SHRIMP CEVICHE with chips
Disappointing.  A bit bland and it had more veg filler than any shrimp.  Very little shrimp.  


The agua frescas were refreshing and different.  So yummy!!!!   We had the pineapple basil and watermelon. So so so good.  Definitely must try. 


5 stars for service 

3.5 stars for food

5 stars Agua frescas 

3 stars for price."}
{"text":"New location is amazing, staff is very friendly and the food is great. Tried the Kalbi and it was fantastic and liked the new take on the California burrito with the tatter tots. Carne asada  is tender and juicy and the fresh made salsa has a good kick to them. Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine your average taco shop. Well, this is not it. There's definitely a twist to the classic Mexican dishes offered with its incorporation of hints of Asian flavors. Located at The District at Green Valley Ranch, Me Gusta Taco creates unique flavors that you won't find elsewhere. You have the option of ordering tacos, burritos, and other Mexican eats such as nachos. There are a variety of sauces available ranging from mild to super hot. I forgot the name of the flavor, but I really enjoyed indulging in my meal with the green sauce. Everything that I have ordered has been carefully cooked and provided me with a satisfying stomach and happy mind!

The stacked tator tots are my favorite. The tator tots are actually crispy (I have had bad experiences at other restaurants where it was soggy) and it's presented like a nacho dish with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and your choice of meat (the chicken was on point). 

The fish tacos and chicken tacos were also amazing. The cilantro on the fish taco was especially a nice addition. 

On top of the delicious food, the service is always 10/10. Travis is always knowledgeable and patient as I try to make a decision about what to choose from the menu. Everyone always has a smile, which is always a great addition to great food!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot. Beautiful design, good seating, wonderful customer service and amazing food! I went with the California burrito it has tots inside with cold cheese what a combo. Will be back weekly"}
{"text":"Went here because of the YELP reviews. I was greeted when I entered and since I was the only customer, my order was taken right away. Their salsa is kept in a fridge in squeeze bottles which is great! I ordered the pork belly and Korean tacos and wine. The presentation is beautiful! I wasn't impressed with either as far as how tough the meat was, but the flavor is terrific! They don't deserve a 4 star, but certainly not a 3."}
{"text":"Started with kalbi beef, vegetarian and shredded pollo tacos, ended up getting another kalbi and their nachos too.

Checked in and even got a strawberry lemon Agua fresca as well.  

Place has an easy clean vibe.  Bright, well made food offering authentic and fusion flavors."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a couple of tacos and they were delicious. Really fresh and great flavor."}
{"text":"Si! Me gusta tacos! Also, me gusta burritos! Especially when there are tater tots in the burrito. If you like tater tots in your burritos, too, order the California burrito! Add some guacamole and yum yum, delicioso! 

This location is much larger than their first location at The District at Green Valley Ranch, but parking may be a little hard during the lunch rush hour. 

The food here is very simple. Simple tacos, simple burritos, simple churros. If you get too complex, it's a little overwhelming. Me Gusta Tacos got it right! They also have three salsas with three different degrees of spiciness. I do like that they keep the salsa in the refrigerator to keep them cool! 

I would admit, Me Gusta Tacos wouldn't be the first place I'd go to get tacos. But it's still a great place to eat at if you're close by and just want something simple! Or if you want warm, crunchy churros!"}
{"text":"It's in between a 3.5 to 4 stars but this place does have some good options for food....we ordered:

Pork Belly Banh Mi Tacos - Interesting take on tacos and done well.

Shredded Pollo Tacos - Exactly what it is, nothing over the top.

Kalbi Tacos - Probably my favorite choice of meat as it had the most flavor and was tender...similar to Kogi...havent had Kogi in 4 years but I want to say they are similar...

Carne Asada California Burrito - Ok in flavor but I hate that fake guacamole super smooth shit....just like I hate nacho cheese sauce or places that put fake cheese on their nachos.

Roasted Corn with Bacon - Good and has that same tangy taste as some Mexican candy....

Pineapple Basil Agua Fresca - Sooo good and the flavor is something new and unique. This and the kalbi are the highlights of this place for sure

An interesting and different option to your traditional taco spot and another great addition to the Southwest side"}
{"text":"My husband and I had one of the best urban Mexican food in the suburban area of Las Vegas! I loved the shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"Me Gusta has burritos and tacos headlining their menu but what separates these items from the others is their quality ingredients. I sampled four of the proteins for lunch and they were all fresh and flavorful. You'll pay a little extra here, but that's where your money is going. I'm a fan and I still haven't tried any of the breakfast (served all day) and \"other\" items, such as the the breakfast burritos, me gusta bowl, or stacked tater tots.

For the shortest walk, if you feel like you're going to melt in the heat, park in the lot of the District that is closest to Lucille's and Panera and walk north on the alley in front of Lucille's. We came at three o'clock on a Thursday to a clean, open, simply decorated restaurant with no other customers. The employee at the register was very courteous and helpful offering some nice suggestions. During our meal, two gentlemen, who I believe were the owners came in to do some work, but they took the time to greet us and inquire how our meal was while lowering the blinds over the front window to block the sun from blinding us.

My favorite item was the Korean kalbi taco on a flour tortilla. The meat was seasoned well while still being able to taste the marinade, with Asian cabbage slaw providing a nice crunch. If you would like a salsa, you can pick it out of the cooler. Don't be afraid of the habanero if you like spice, which they rate 9/10. Although it did have a kick, it didn't phase me.

I'm ok with the $21 lunch for two. Breakfast with churros for dessert is on the agenda for the next trip. If you're in the District and in the mood for some Mexican, Me Gusta Tacos is definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Ok...so YELP sent me an email that said....LET'S TALK TACOS!!! I was excited to see some new places on the email and looked at the reviews, pictures, etc. 
Decided to try here because everything sounded so yummy...and the pix looked pretty good too and I just plain LOVE tacos. I decided to take my employee as a thank you for all of her hard work.
We got there and no one was in the restaurant...so we had time to talk to the cashier and make up our minds on what to eat!
I chose the 3 taco mix and match plate. My employee had a spicy bacon breakfast burrito, we both had the watermelon mint Agua Fresca and I got a water and I ordered the stacked tater tots...$36 and change. I even tipped them the rest of the $40 I gave her. 
The tater tots and my tacos came out together which had me just a little concerned....it took them just as long to cook the meat for my tacos as deep frying the tater tots??? The tater tots were suppose to have cheese, crema and guacamole. They came out with crema and guacamole and the cheese was so melted it was off the tots and on the bottom of the paper container. :/ So I waited to eat my tacos until her burrito came out. When it came out it was already cut in half for her.... so I looked at it and said ,\" where's your bacon?\" She said oh it's there, took a few bites, no bacon, a few more bites, crumbles of bacon. It was so stuffed with eggs and tater tots but barely any bacon.
I bit into my 1st taco, which was the Asian one, the meat was COLD, chewy and just tasteless. I couldn't chew the meat so I had to spit it out. I pulled out a piece of meat and felt it to see if in fact it was cold or if it was just the Asian slaw on it....NOPE meat was cold. Tasted like it was last night's. So then I pulled out a piece of meat from my 2nd taco, Carne asada. COLD...I handed it to my employee and said is it just me or is that cold? She took it and said no...it's COLD! so by this point I am done. Don't even care if 3rd taco is done. 
Not only all of that but the salsa is not salsa, no heat, no flavor, so watered down that when I 1st went to use it, nothing but clear liquid came out.
So...something I never do...I asked for my money back for the tacos, I really should have asked for the tater tot back too ...and for an all egg burrito it was $9. If I could make this a -star....I would.
Sad. Sad day for tacos! I will not be back..."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick service tacos located near the splash pad at the District! You get 3 tacos for around $10. You can mix and match tacos and the nachos are yummy too!

They have kids options and drink options. Staff was great and the place was nice and clean. It's a pretty small space so seating is limited and the outside seating is mostly parents with their kids playing in the water. 

An awesome location to grab a bite if you are at the splash pad and get hungry."}
{"text":"Very cute and tasty! Love their salsa and tea selection. Their vegan taco was delicious!! 3 nice sized tacos with a side of tortilla chips. MEGA NICE STAFF! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't really get this place...maybe I was expecting some more authentic flavors or just better quality.  The carne asada was flavorful but the tortillas were completely falling apart as I was eating them.  Most of the places double layer them to prevent this from happening but not here.  The salsa we had seemed very watered down, even salsa from a jar tastes better.  The kalbi burrito was also completely underwhelming, it didn't really taste like kalbi.  Th chips were in the take out containers....maybe that's why they were slightly chewy.  Most places put the chips in a separate bag so they don't get wet or soggy from the hot elements.  Anyways the only highlight of the meal was the churro, pretty delicious...but could have used more bavarian cream inside.  I think they were pretty stingy with the cream, quite a few bites of churro with no cream.  Maybe breakfast burritos are better here...."}
{"text":"Love Love Love th place!!!  So grateful to have them in the neighborhood.  It's clear they are about quality ingredients and healthy.  The salsas are made throughout the day and taste homemade.  I always order tons of food.

Go to order is 4 vegetarian tacos, the anthem burrito add barbacoa, 4 barbacoa tacos, 1 churro, strawberry lemonade and lots of salsa.  I keep left overs in fridge and then just take plastic lid off and heat up in microwave because their dishes aren't plastic!!!

We go here like twice a week so good!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight.  Had the me gusta bowl with Kalbi and my husband had the tots.  Friendly fast service.  Not thrilled with the pineapple basil agua.  Too watery.  Food was very tasty!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love it! I had the California Burrito with chicken. The tortilla was fresh, slightly browned, not too thick and really good. Looking forward to coming back soon. Clean interior design too! Thanks for the great service Yanet."}
{"text":"Great environment in and out side not busy when I went kid friendly if you have kids the tacos are great!!!! Tried the Korean kalbi, and the asada! Yumm! Only have suggestions to make it better (Mexican cokes) I will be back! Open a location in southwest please!!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and explained the menu well since it was my first time. The prices are little high, but their food is quite delicious. I ordered the California burrito with korean kalbi. I'll admit it was too sweet for me, but my brothers definitely liked it. But let me just say, their green sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Me Gusta Tacos is a good place to find hipster-like recreation of burritos but if you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant, this place is no the place for you. Their nachos are okay, and so are their burritos, but a little too overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The drinks are good. The people that work here are very friendly. Not the first place I would go to when craving authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"This place was friendly, very clean and organized, prices are reasonable, and the food was good. I liked that there were healthy choices on the menu and that the Jamaica did not have a lot of sugar."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner our first night in Henderson. We didn't know what we wanted after a 10 hour drive and decided on this place. Super glad we did! The tacos are amazing! My nephew had the spicy bacon burrito which he also loved. My wife had the me gusto bowl, with no meat(she is vegetarian) and it was also top notch! I would definitely return here for tacos in the future, and recommend anyone who is on the fence to come! Staff is friendly and the menu is simple."}
{"text":"This was another bookmark realized. I happen to be out in Green Valley visiting my Mom and we decided to check this place out.

This is not a large space, can sit about maybe 20 people indoors and there are some tables outside too. It was super hot the day we ate there so we grabbed an inside spot. Our order was taken at the front and then the food was brought out by the staff. I had the three tacos. Two were pollo and the other was fish. They have three really tasty salsas to choose from and I tried all three. I was partial to the green one. I would have to say that the fish taco was really the best due to the creamy wasabi sauce. I need to go back again and try something new like one of the burritos. Overall it wasn't an amazing meal but it was good enough for me to stop by again the future."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that I was impressed... But alas. No. 

I took the family to GV district to try this place. It is SUPER small. Six(ish) tables total, so I hope you don't have more than 5-6 people in your party, or you will be eating outside if it's busy. 

I tried the egg and steak burrito, the fish tacos, carnitas tacos, kalbi tacos, and barbacoa tacos, as well as the pineapple basil agua fresca. The best thing was the drink.

The egg and steak burrito was very heavily seasoned. And it wasn't a \"heavily good\" seasoned. The fish tacos.. while the fish was good and flaky (grilled - not fried), the sauce - or wasabi crema - was so overwhelming that you cannot taste the fish at all. I had to wipe all of the sauce off with a napkin to actually taste fish. The carnitas tacos were the best of the bunch in my opinion, and hubby liked the barbacoa. The kalbi was not a favorite.

I think this place has potential, but I think that some of the dishes could be re-engineered."}
{"text":"I've ate here twice. I was not impressed the first time but figured it deserved a second chance. Disappointed again. There's no flavor! The chicken and pork are bland and the carne asada tastes of cinnamon. The rice is moist but again, no flavor. I'm really baffled by this. Plus, it is pricey. I will not be going a third time. The two stars are for atmosphere, and the nice staff."}
{"text":"There are many choices in this area for food. We chose this place because 1) we like tacos, and 2) faster food for more shopping. 
That being said, the food was great; fresh and just the right portion size. 
The salsas were on point. Red was mild, green a little warmer, but the habanero was the bomb! Fruit up front; heat came on later. 
We only tried two tacos. The chicken and fish. Both were excellent. 
Need to come back for the pork belly bahn mi and carne asada . And then all the rest. Fantastic prices! Great staff. Can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Food:
- 3 tacos (fish, chicken, carnitas). Came with a few chips. Fish and chicken were bland and carnitas was too salty. Blah city. 
- Free agua fresca with Yelp check-in. Pineapple Basil.  I couldn't decide if I liked the agua Fresca. The basil gets a bit weird after a while.  

Service: super friendly. They let us try the strawberry lemonade and the pineapple basil since I couldn't decide. 

Ambiance: we opted for the outdoor seating which was enjoyable in the sun (screaming 2 year olds aside, but what do you expect being next to the splash pad).

I just didn't like the food.  I'd rather go to Taco y Taco where the flavor explodes."}
{"text":"This place has great tacos! I try to visit here at least once a week and every time I come in the staff is friendly and the service is excellent. The best part is the food. It's always clean and inviting and I've never had a bad experience here. I'm a customer for life."}
{"text":"It's good...if you're craving mexican but the tacos are just ok. This place reminds me of when I was in high school and I thought I was making some of the best tacos around, not really knowing what good street style tacos were. The workers were nice. And I like that this place is in the District and allows you to grab a quick fix if you really want \"Mexican.\" I also think it's good if you really just need something quick for you and/or the kids but honestly you're better off going to Albertsons/Smiths buying some tortillas, salsa, ground taco meat and a lawrys packet. Pretty much the same thing. While it does offer some different choices in meats it's really just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place has the best California burrito!! I love that you can pick which type of meat in it- I love the barbacoa!!! Also their stacked tots are delicious but the serving is huge so make sure to share!"}
{"text":"I love my gusta tacos the service is nice and the food is freshly made and it's not too far from my house"}
{"text":"Put the banh mi taco in your face right now! Your life will be better because you did. It just will. Good banh mi has a magical quality that they managed to capture and it pairs surprisingly well with a tortilla! The galbi taco is wonderful also. This place is more than worth a try if you are in the mood for more of a gourmet type taco than authentic street taco style. You should also try every single one of their augua frescas."}
{"text":"I had three tacos: the kalbi beef, the chicken, and the vegetarian. The kalbi beef was tasty and enjoyable, definitely something I would order again. The chicken was ok, not particularly memorable. The vegetarian one was a bit disappointing--just not quite as much flavor as the other two. But given that these are not basic tacos, I'd say the price point is reasonable. I would probably change two of the three tacos, but it is a place to which I would return."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, but way over priced. Tacos are smaller than street tacos. Kids don't usually like black beans, but that is what the burritos are made of on the kids menu."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious. Mexican food on another level. They are different than other Mexican places. The California burrito with kalbi beef was a little sweet, but good. The tacos were served with a good amount of meat. My son loved his cheese quesadilla. 
Their cantaloupe agua fresca was awesome.   
We will definitely be coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"Good service. Bland tacos. Meat was dry and flavorless. Everything was covered in chopped onions - too overpowering. Definitely won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"Great taco joint in The District in Henderson that has great variety and quality of food at a good value. I highly recommend you to try it."}
{"text":"Love this place, between the Hibiscus, Pineapple Basil, Cantaloupe drinks along with just about everything on the menu I'm hooked. Definitely a regular now after few months back trying it for first time.  Would recommend this place to anyone.  Staff are nice and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Was truly disappointed with our food.. people hype this place up way too much. The staff was super friendly and nice but the food was disgusting.. the carne asada tasted like it was old and smelt terrible.. kinda wishing I would've went through Roberto's drive-thru instead. They definitely need to get a different kind of meat"}
{"text":"California Burrito
Carne asada, beans, cheese, salsa, and TATER TOTS. How can a burrito be bad if it has tots in there? I ended up adding Spanish rice in there also. The burrito large enough where I couldn't even finish it. The carne asada was very good, not excellent. Overall, great burrito.

Watermelon Mint
Feel free to ask them to sample the different drinks. I did that, and I ended up choosing the watermelon, hands down. The Watermelon Mint is their most popular, according to the cashier, and deserving so. I thought it was the best out of the drinks. Very refreshing watermelon coolness with a hint of mint.

I went on a Saturday evening, and there was live music outside with a bunch of children playing in the water. Grab some tacos and enjoy."}
{"text":"Tacos were good. Getting a choice of 3 different ones is a good choice for the price. It's hard for me to rate any restaurant 5 stars. This place is very clean and the customer service is very good. My one fault I found was; when I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect chips and salsa. Now you get that here but the side of chips is minimal. I'm a chip guy, I usually order a lot of food, then fill up on chips then take my order home and have lunch for the next day. Salsa was tasty, just not enough chips to go with."}
{"text":"We followed the yelp reviews to this delicious taco joint. Definitely not traditional Mexican but oh so tasty and fresh. All the tacos we tried were great, including the pork belly and barbacoa. The warm taco chips on the side were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean, and great food! It doesn't get better than that! Exactly what this neighborhood needed. Unfortunately, the southwest part of town is congested with mediocre dirty restaurants so it's nice to have this as an option."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos in town. Only gripe is that they close a little too early, at 9."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend stopping here, their food is awesome.  We got 3 tacos for 10 bucks which isn't too bad. Bathe tacos were great and their homemade salsas made them even better. Great service and everyone there was very friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say- I love eating food with intense flavor.  I love Me Gusta Tacos Food, every time I am at the District I have to stop by, especially during the summer they are right next to the splash pad, so it was on for the summer.  Even if I didnt order there food items, I would alway go in for some refreshing drinks, I love homemade fresh drinks, my favorite is the watermelon, it's so darn good and it would alway quench my thirst.  I really wish I could grab a Beer and enjoy it while I watched my son frolic in the water, but drinking in the heat is alway a no go for me.  My absolute thing to order here is the Korean tacos- they have a very sweet and savory flavor- plus I love marinated KOrean bbq, so converting it into a taco is genius idea. I love the slaw that is layered on top and even putting some of their homemade salsa is a must!  Plus I love the fact that my son can grab an inexpensive kids meal (cheese quesadilla) and he's set!  
I can't wait to go to there second location that is opening up Dec 9th, I definitely gonna go check it out and hopefully they will have some awesome giveaways- I aiming for free tacos- a girl can wish right?"}
{"text":"More than I expected! Located in the district next to Green Valley Ranch (next to Lucielle's) it's more expensive than a similar shop elsewhere, but the food is fresh and everything was pretty tasty. I had the shrimp burrito ($9.50) which came with a side of tortilla chips. The jumbo shrimp were plentiful but most importantly - not over cooked. The inside is a little small and sterile feeling but clean.
They have a trio of fresh salsas that are great but I wasn't a fan of the habanero - way too sweet. 
Overall, a good place to visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Im glad I didn't write a review after my first visit and gave Me Gusta a second chance. I ordered a carnitas mission burrito and after the first bite I tasted a very sweet spice flavor I did not like at all. For me, Mexican food should not be sweet, especially carnitas. I found out they cook their carnitas in cinnamon sticks which completely overpowered the meat. 

I gave them a second try and ordered the California burrito with carne asada. My other half ordered the mission burrito with chicken (only shredded chicken offered). My burrito was good but definitely nothing I can't get somewhere else. The tater tots were a nice addition and the melted cheddar added much needed flavor. It was quite plain and needed a lot more spice. 

The chicken burrito was also very mild and lacked any mexican flavors. An employee stopped by to chat with us. On both visits the service has been excellent and employees very friendly. He explained to us that they need to cater to the clientele in that area so all the food is made very mild. I could not disagree more but I don't own the business. Personally I would cook MY food and not change family recipes because of the neighborhood I am in."}
{"text":"Great place to eat a good healthy meal and very affordable, staff and great team
I recommend Me Gusta Taco at anytime"}
{"text":"Very Americanized Mexican but the freshness and quality is top notch. All the sauces are delicious and homemade. They have a wide variety of freshly made drinks (always sold out by the time I make it there, so I'm assuming it's good). Food is made to order and has something for everyone including vegetarians. Fish tacos weren't seasoned but with everything packed in there, it did not lack flavor. Delicious, chargrilled vegetables in the veggie tacos. Very casual, good for catching up with friends and satisfying a hungry belly. You don't feel guilty about eating this food. 

I would definitely go back and give some of the other menu items a shot."}
{"text":"Wow-I guess I must have really got them on an off day. This was my late lunch/my kids' early dinner. Firstly I live in Rhodes Ranch and ordered via UberEats. It came in record time so you would think it would have been nice and warm-think again. The carne asada burrito had hardly any meat in it and was cold, the rice was used to fill it. Looking at it looked so promising but actually taking a bite made me say; WHY DID I NOT GO TO TACO BELL AND SAVE 20 DOLLARS? My son's quesadilla was cold, the carne asada taco was miniscule. Chips were used a lot as filler for the plates to make them look good. My daughter loves guacamole and this is about  the only thing I can truly say was done right (and the salsa at least had a \"bite\" to it). Otherwise I will definitely be heading for the boarder....TACO BELL next time. Very disappointing considering I wanted a non fast food taco place to get good Mexican. I mean Las Vegas can screw almost anything up but this place really took it to new levels."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Mexican cuisine. From the food to the fresh aquas frescas (fresh waters) everything here is absolutely amazing. I'd recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Delicious! My favorite is the pork banh mi taco and Korean kalbi. Perfect portions and really great quality food. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My friends & I just randomly came across this spot on Yelp while trying to find something near by & first timers & definitely was amazing. Fresh ingredients & very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I wish they had another location near my house because I'd be there every week! My weakness, the bulgogi tacos! It's sweet, beefy, and DELICIOUS all around! You get three tacos in one order which is enough to satisfy hunger. You can also add some salsa which you can take from a mini fridge. I think they make them fresh because they look like it. 

The service is okay. Nothing worth remembering but I'm a fan of the ambiance and pretty much everything in the menu. I have yet to try the juice they make but upon check in, you can get them for free. I was a little too late to redeem mine so I saved the voucher for future visits. 

I also like that my order came with fresh nachos. It was warm and crispy which is just the way I loved them! 

When you're around the area, I highly recommend going!"}
