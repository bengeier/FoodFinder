{"text":"I got a \"chicken carver sandwich\" from this location.  Because I know they do not usually pick fresh chicken for the sandwiches (it's generally pre-picked and kept in the carver station in equipment that keeps it hot and at a food-safe temperature unless business is incredibly slow), I requested that my sandwich be made with fresh chicken.  It was well after the lunch rush and I knew that if they still had chicken picked from earlier, it'd no doubt be kind of gross tasting by now.  They smiled and assured me they would definitely give me fresh chicken.  

When I returned to work, I opened my food to find that not only had they not given me fresh chicken, they gave me the most disgusting, inedible piece of chicken I have ever gotten from a restaurant in my entire life.  It was so dried out that the breast meat was turning shades of medium and dark brown.  An image of this sandwich has been uploaded to Yelp's page for this Boston Market location.

Chicken has to be sitting in a dry, hot environment for a long time in order to degrade so badly.  It doesn't just happen magically.  So when I called to tell them what happened, the woman on the other end assured me \"we only use fresh chicken\".  She lied through her teeth.  I have worked for Boston Market in the past and am well aware of their food storage processes.

She offered me a replacement sandwich and was not the least concerned that her employees were serving chicken that no one in their right mind would eat.  Something tells me Corporate would have a much different take on the situation.  For the safety of others, I'm considering going to the main store where corporate meets and letting them know that the Strongsville location does not meet Boston Market's standards for service or food safety.

Try the location in Brooklyn (Ridge Park Square) instead.  They're held to a higher standard."}
{"text":"Ok maybe i am too picky. But i heard how good their food is...! Yeah if you were on of those kids who liked cafeteria food back in high school maybe. Now the workers are 100 %better than the mean upset cafeteria workers, friendly and more than helpful. Over all they are clean and have a welcoming atmosphere. But i would encourage those of you who are interested to try it for your selves, my boyfriend loved their meat loaf."}
{"text":"Drove from shopping in central phx to this Boston market for some \"healty\" food and did not get what we expected. The whole rotisserie chicken was pale and rubbery. The chicken was quartered, while trying to find chicken all I came up with was fat. Very poor quality chicken. 

Tried the new rotisserie potatoes, very old, hard, and burnt. 

The one star is for the corn bread, luckily that wasn't screwed up."}
{"text":"went through drive through and had such a sweet lady with glasses do my order. Great food, especially considering it was a drive thru. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Been to this location three times now and the service here has been excellent. The employees are always so nice and really seem to go the extra mile to be friendly. Kudos to Kenn that was working the drive thru tonight! Very thorough and pleasant!"}
{"text":"When I stop in here with the family (which is usually once every other month) we typically get the rotisserie chicken family meal.  Food has never been bad, but has never been great.  Sometimes you get a side that's been sitting out for awhile, sometimes the side has just been prepared.  Service when ordering is your standard fast food restaurant service.  After  you sit down, you typically never see an employee again.
As Jason M. mentioned, the place is typically quite messy, though whenever we're there, there's never more than 2 tables occupied.  No matter the time of year, the place always seems to be cold.  I remember seeing employees wearing jackets while working, and it was August.
This place is no worse or better than any other fast food place in the area."}
{"text":"There were bubbles of soap shining on the tops of my various side dishes so I couldn't even eat my lunch."}
{"text":"Used to.like their chicken dinners, but the veggies have gotten worse and worse. ..no matter what time we go, veggies are limp, overcooked and watery.  Too bad, as they hire great kids and Mar is awesome....hope food can be improved"}
{"text":"Went here with 2 co-workers. Not too busy of time of day. They gave us 2 meals. Obviously, we ordered 3. They actually tried to briefly argue that they gave us all our meals. Seriously? 3 sitting at the table with 2 meals. 2+2 equals.....? Food was good though."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but worth it. It's typical to spend around $15 for 2 people, which for fast food is up there. Even though the Yelp pricer thing say, cheap? Turkey with corn and mash potatoes and mac n cheese. Mmmmm. I only with they still had the sirloin."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome experience here!

It has been a number of years since I've eaten at a Boston Market... In the down time, they have REALLY upped their game! 

The food was very tasty... solid comfort food if you're in the mood for it. But you already knew and expected that.

What earned 5 stars for me was the service I got. The staff is friendly, personable, and quick. The food was delivered to my table on a real plate with real silverware. Someone stopped by my table mid-meal just to be sure the meal had met my expectations. And everything was very clean. 

I don't remember Boston Market going that far above and beyond standard fast food service... not sure of this is new company mandate or if it's just this location, but I certainly loved the experience! More fast food places need to up their game to this level!"}
{"text":"Great for people who want food fast and are willing to give up poor quality, unhealthy ingredients and crappy customer service.

The food is fresh, yummy and affordable (personal favorite = pot pie) - it's clean and comfortable - and the people working there are incredibly, almost unbelievably, friendly and attentive. Kudos to the manager for creating an environment that is all too rare in the Valley.

I don't know if all Boston Markets are like this one, but this one is really good."}
{"text":"The cream spinach was great, and they knocked it out if the ball park with sweet potatoes.  Guest loved it."}
{"text":"In comparing this Boston Market location to other Boston Markets and comparing Boston Market to other fast-foodish restaurants, I give it 5 stars. The individuals working at this location are great. Very attentive and friendly. They even wish you well as you leave. It's also a very clean establishment. The food tastes very fresh. Their sandwiches are great. Drink selection is great too...beyond the usual fountain drinks, they have two kinds of lemonade and four kinds of tea. Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Employees here are always super friendly, even though this restaurant seems to have the worst customers I've ever seen. No joke, I visit this location every few months and every single time I have had a rude customer in front of me or behind me. If they aren't plowing me down to race me into the door then they are complaining about something or demanding something special (FOR FREE) because they are entitled jerks. Employees are always smiling and polite and patient, I really don't know how they do it. 

Service aside, the food is always fresh and tasty. I'm constantly seeing the sides being swapped out, even during slow times in the middle of the afternoon. I like knowing the food isn't just sitting there under heat lamps getting crusty. The meals are a great value, and they reheat nicely. Sometimes you have to remind them to give you your cornbread, but after seeing what they have to deal with at this location I definitely let them slide on that."}
{"text":"I love going to this Boston Market, the location is convenient and the food and staff are excellent.  On a recent visit there was an issue with my debit card, their machine would not process my payment for some reason.  A big thank you to the manager, Matt, who
came to the rescue at the counter and I was able to have the chicken dinner that evening I had wanted all day!!!  Thank you Matt, this is the only Boston Market location I visit and I
appreciate your assistance greatly!!!  I plan to pay it forward!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been dreaming of you. Oh Boston Market, since I have moved south, I have been looking back on our past with such fond memories.

I sometimes cry knowing we are so far away from each other... and oh how I long for your tender turkey breast.  Cornbread that just melts in your mouth, and even the vegetables are from some other planet of awesomeness.

MC Burger Taco Box just isn't doing it for me anymore. Last night, in a desperate act of \"preparing dinner\" avoidance, the family loaded up and headed over to a slightly mediocre eating establishment *cough*pandaexpress*cough* and not only were we hurried through the maze of fried, sauteed, and mono-saturated, we were yelled at by probably the smallest woman I have ever seen. There was no warm smiles, rotisserie chicken, or green bean casserole.  

I love you Boston Market, please move to Laveen, before I am battered and deep fried.

{"text":"I know, I know, this is a food chain and people should not support it... ,but I can't help it... I love their food. There's no Boston Market in Hawaii so when I visit family in Lakewood I make sure I stop here to have some chicken and mac n cheese. Hey at least it's a real meal compared to Mc Donald's. They definitely need to open one up in Hawaii!!!!"}
{"text":"I live a couple of blocks away and I've been going here off and on since it opened. Usually I get good service. The last time though I went on a Friday night (10/9) at about 8 PM. One couple ahead of me who ordered and was being rung up by a tall african american guy. Younger white girl in the drive thru helping customers, A taller hispanic girl with a chefs hat on in the cooking area said \"just a minute and we'll be right with you\". So I waited, and waited, and waited. A hispanic guy in a red shirt (manager?) came out of the back and then another employee comes out as well. So, I waited, and waited.... you get the picture. 5 employees on duty versus 3 customers and finally I couldn't wait any longer. I walked out and wont be back."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, I was at the Boston  Market on Detroit Av. I call in to report the the bad service. No one  never got back to me. I was with another gentleman and they offer him a special. I ask about the special. They said they can only give it to him. When I ask to speak to a manager, she had no comment. She stood there looking stupid. She then offer the gentleman a free cookie. That was another slap in face just rude. I now feel different about Boston Market. I prefer not to eat there."}
{"text":"I've never had Boston Market before, but when Grub Hub added it for delivery my coworker and I decided to try it. I ordered the Caesar bowl w chicken and he ordered the turkey meal. He was happy with his but my lettuce was brown and gooey in several areas. Not impressed by quality control there. The corn bread was good though."}
{"text":"Seriously this food is no good. And it's not cheap either. The meat smells weird, lettuce   is old.  Bread is pretty good. Money better spent else where."}
{"text":"This place has hit rock bottom . Food gone down hill and employees are slow & stupid . Never again"}
{"text":"This was a nice dining experience and great food.  The service was fine, people were nice but not overly nice.  The only super weird thing was there were no napkin dispensers and no trash cans for patrons.  You had to ask for napkins and you were supposed to leave your garbage for the employees to pick up.  It was kind of strange.  I feel like every restaurant should have at least one garbage can in the dining room."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I go here all the time and the service and food are always exceptional. Super friendly employees."}
{"text":"During the work week I have to eat out for lunch quite a bit and I get tired of paying 10+ for lunch. I remembered hearing something about Boston Market having a $5 lunch special so I figured I would go check it out... Finally there is a place that has good, somewhat healthy and well priced lunches! Your choice of carver sandwich with soup/salad and a drink, they have soup and salad and I can't remember the others but it was a pretty nice selection. 

You pay more at McDonald's for a combo and this is way better! If you are out and about for lunch I would highly recommend going here. I'm sure most people have eaten here before so the food won't be a big surprise but the price is GREAT! This will definitely be a go to for me."}
{"text":"First of all, I am a huge Boston Chicken fan (yes Boston Chicken that was the original name) and because I am a creature of habit, I tend to stick with what I know and after you visit an establishment many times it becomes not so much about the food(you already know you like it or you wouldnt keep going back) it becomes about the whole package.
The service here is outstanding! On my most recent visit I was overwhelmed by all the fresh choices I had for my sides. So instead of just the three large sides that comes with the meal...this young girl bent over backwards to please me and let me get several smaller size sides so that I wouldnt leave un-satisified. 
Wish I could steal this girl and make her my employee which to me is an obvious sign of great training!!
Thankyou Boston Chicken on Ridge Rd in Parma!!! I will be back"}
{"text":"Decent food, but not much more than that. The vegetables I got with the deal tasted like plastic.  The chicken was ok. I'm not trying to be negative, there just wasn't anything that wowed me for it being my first time."}
{"text":"Great food with a great environment, fresh chicken with a bunch of sides that hit the spot, I truly like this place and would recommend it to everyone.. the staff is very nice and welcoming .. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My food was prepared by an employee liberally coughing over the food.  She was extremely careless while handling the food and being around the food, and appeared to be ill.  It was simply disgusting.  When I expressed my concern to her about her coughing around food to be served to customers, she responded with the same carelessness and a juvenile \"I don't care\" attitude accompanied with a disingenuous smile.  The management of this establishment should exercise better judgment in assigning tasks to employees.  Keep the careless (and therefore dangerous) Neanderthal airheads away from the food!"}
{"text":"I arrived a Boston Market at 9:00 pm  and there was no food to order. They had no chicken available and no one offered me a thing just an I. Sorry........ bad business !!"}
{"text":"Wanted to pick some good food up on my way home from work. Hours say it's open until 10pm. I Got to the door at 9:45 pm and it was locked. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday 4/9/16 about about 6:00 with my girlfriend and the place was abnormally dirty.  We both ordered the chichen and rib dinner with 2 sides.  Taste was pretty good.  
Now the horror starts! We get home and i get violently sick from both ends.  Could not sleep at all... Now it's Sunday morning and its her turn. She is going through the same thing i did. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Boston market needs to understand when there employees are working and talking Customers Can hear them talking crap about people and looks very bad especially if they are talking crap about other employees,very disappointed in the managers mostly when they talk crap almost as bad as any other employee Doesn't look good at all cause the food is very good and I would hate to stop coming into Boston market that is right next to my work at pizza place"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Boston Market.  This location is the one closest to my house and has aways given me consistent quality food.  Highly recommend.  I love the hot apples in cinnamon sauce and the cornbread is addictive."}
{"text":"This is one of the best I have been to.  You get an actual plate with your salad.  They serve you at your seat, and have posted not to tip.  The food is consistent.  Never had a bad meal there or experience"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing every time I have been there. Never had cold food, or chewy food, or anything bad at all. The employees there are some of the friendliest you will ever interact with at any restaurant in the area!! Dining area is always super clean and inviting"}
{"text":"Food is good
Staff is usually pretty good but young redhead that works late seems to hate life. She sounds like she hates life and has zero service skills. I avoid going in there when I see her that's how much of a buzz kill she is."}
{"text":"Ugh, Boston Market has been on the down hill lately - especially this one.  Tonight my chicken was dried out and the size of the corn bread shrunk by about 50% since the last time I visited."}
{"text":"Great location and great service!  Probably one of the best I've been too!  The service was my the highlight and it was a great dinner, too."}
{"text":"Back when my hubby & I moved into our first apartment together, we would pick up Boston at least once a month. After a couple years of doing so we got pretty burnt out on it & stopped going for a while. Last week the hubs suddenly got a craving for it, so we hit up the drive thru for dinner. We got the family meal for three & chose the chicken with mac & cheese, red potatoes & corn for our sides. It also comes with 4 pieces of cornbread. We got some dessert as well, a cookie & a brownie. Their chicken is pretty good, better than KFC but not as good as El Pollo Loco. Their sides are pretty good as well but very fattening. The cornbread is yummy, my hubby is a big fan. I had the cookie which was sweet & a bit crunchy, hubs had the brownie which was rich & very soft. Total for the family meal & desserts was about $26. A bit pricey, but we both had dinner & I believe my hubby squeezed two lunches out of it as well. I'm sure we'll be back eventually!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for fast food.  I haven't been to one of these places in over 5 years.  They serve the typical thanksgiving type foods or comfort foods. It was late and right down the street from my house so I picked this over Taco Bell.    I had a slider meal.  It had 3 little sandwiches a side and a drink for 5 bucks.   I got two turkey and cheese and a meatloaf.  My side was spinach w/ gobs of cheese creamy unhealthiness.

The standout of the evening was the sign next to the register on the glass case.  It was worth 5 + stars

\"We're happy to freshly toss your salad.  Just ask!\"


I laughed and sent the pic to my firneds.  The sign alone makes this place worth the visit"}
{"text":"Have been avoiding this place for the last year, due to repeated bad experiences.  Thought we'd give them another chance, and see if things have improved.

At the restaurant, we noticed that all of our side dishes were lukewarm, almost tepid, even though we watched them serve our meals fresh from the steam table. This was between 6:30 and 7:00 PM on a Sunday, so not just before closing time.

Unfortunately both me and my wife got food poisoning.  Again."}
{"text":"Food is as good as expected, but the people are oh so nice, and willing to spend a minute answering questions.  Good for group meals / take out."}
{"text":"I honestly do not want to come to this location until the older woman named judi leaves the store. She is so rude and many customers walked out the door along with me. She is a manager who yelled at the cashier for helping another employee. Completely uncalled for. If I could give no stars I would. Her attitude towards the employees as well as some customers was horrible."}
{"text":"I stopped in here yesterday for lunch (I've been here many times in the past).  What has happened to Boston Market?  The food is terrible. I ordered a turkey dinner and the turkey tastes like pre-packaged and re-heated stuff...not the type usually cooked in the store.  The mashed potatoes had the consistency of kindergarten paste and tasted about the same.  The gravy has been changed and is terrible.  The mixed vegetables were under-cooked as well.  The mini cornbread loaf that is usually sweet and fluffy was tough and doughy.  I couldn't each much of any of this.  I will NEVER step food in a Boston Market again...and that's a promise!!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Everythings been sitting out way longer than it should. Lance the manager has a very fake attitude. Pretends to be nice to customers but clearly isn't a pleasent person. Constantly yelling at his employees as well. On top of the mediocre food, the prices are way too high. Got a chicken carver combo for $10. Not nearly worth that. Maybe $5. Also only one drink size? Worst business module I've ever heard of."}
{"text":"I love Boston Market  at Thanksgiving time. It was so easy to pre-order with them over the phone. Very professional, friendly & helpful. I picked up my order on Thanksgiving day around 1pm & they were so organized, friendly & fast. I will continue to order my Pre-cooked Thanksgiving dinner from them. I was very impressed!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Boston Markets but this is the one closest to me. In my opinion, it's far superior to most fast food but it's nothing special.   It is good if you're too tired make dinner and want something fast and tasty.  The people at the counter are always very nice and helpful.  The side salad is actually pretty good and has more variety than your typical lettuce/carrot combo.  The mac and cheese and the creamed spinach are really good if you're not watching calories."}
{"text":"This is the closest Boston Market to me and I am a huge fan of their food. However the last 2 times I have gone to this location the food has been crap, along with the service. :( The mac&cheese has been hard, the cornbread cold, and just not enjoyable. I would hate to have to stop going and or find a further location! Hope they make some adjustments."}
{"text":"Foods ok but They have really good customor service i posted a negitive yelp review and almost immediately i got a Message asking how They Could change my expirence. That completely changed my point of view also there mac and cheese is actually not that bad."}
{"text":"Here is a direct quote from the CDC site http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/clostridium-perfingens.html

\"What causes C. perfringens food poisoning?
Although C. perfringens may live normally in the human intestine, illness is caused by eating food contaminated with large numbers of C. perfringens bacteria that produce enough toxin in the intestines to cause illness. C. perfringens spores can survive high temperatures. During cooling and holding of food at temperatures from 54°F-140°F (12°C -- 60°C), the spores germinate and then the bacteria grow. The bacteria grow very rapidly between 109°F-- 117°F (43°C --47°C).  If the food is served without reheating to kill the bacteria, live bacteria may be eaten. The bacteria produce a toxin inside the intestine that causes illness.\"


What else causes food poisoning? Boston Market's Chicken Pot Pie

It hurts so bad, totally not worth it..."}
{"text":"Today, this company gets only two stars as I'm hungry and its 907 pm.  Info online says they close at 930.  However with the doors locked and me on the outside looking in still hungry.  They need to update their online information.  

In going to Dwnny's they never close."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Food was good! We had rotisserie chicken, stuffing, Mac 'n Cheese, Loaded Mash Potato, Baked Appples, Apple Pie, and a cookie."}
{"text":"I have been here once only but will definitely be returning.

The food is definitely worth the price (which is a low price in the first place).  They offer a vegetarian option of just sides, which even though I am not vegetarian, I chose over the meat with sides and it was delicious.  My boyfriend got the turkey bowl with two sides and gravy on top and he was very happy with his meal as well.

I really like the cups that they give you.  They are only one size, something like 20 ounces, and are plastic so you can keep reusing them at home!

The employees are not rude but they are a little pushy, like they are in a rush even when the place wasn't busy at all.  They were helpful though.  The restaurant also seemed to be pretty clean when I went in, and the cashier took my food to a table for me to sit at while I got my drink, which was nice.

Like I said, I will be returning."}
{"text":"So many choices! It really is a hit or miss kind of thing at this location, but more hits than misses. Biggest downfall is the service. So I don't know which of the million veggies I want? Don't ignore me for the better part of 10 minutes, make a suggestion!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!!great service. I'll be sure too come back again. Their chicken is phenomenal it has to be the best chicken I have ever had can't wait to go here again even the customer service was excellent thumbs up Boston Market"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times.  I like that the food is fast, but not fast food.  We call it \"Thanksgiving for Lunch\".  The service is good, although they can be annoying when walking the restaurant. 

They lose a half star for taking the salt off the table and hiding it up by the soda machines.  Don't try to be a salt nanny.  And a half star for being too forward (Constantly walking the dining area, and watch out for the frequent buyers club or whatever it is called - they just have a list in front of the register with your contact info sitting there for anyone to read/copy/steal)."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and nice, clean restaurant. We had the Easter dinner special which included a decent amount of ham, two sides of your choice, gravy, cornbread with butter and honey, and a slice of apple pie for $11.99. Try the creamed spinach!"}
{"text":"We love this location on E Bell Rd until they \"re-org\" the staff, the new female manager who works 2nd shift in red shirt (tiny lady who always looks like as grumpy as $&@$) was so rude with zero customer service skills at all.  It's just sad that managers like her exist.

We are not going back at this location as long as grumpy works here. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Going through the drive-through took a while, because the lady in front of me was having an issue. it took the lady 15 minutes to finally resolve the issue, and when I got up to get my food The man in the window apologize for the delay and said that my sandwich was free tonight.

It's just refreshing to know that the people working behind the counter do you realize that there are other people present, aside from the customer they are dealing with."}
{"text":"Boston Market prides itself on having chicken. Unfortunately, they didn't have any at this establishment. Talk about poor planning!"}
{"text":"For such a simple and casual place, ribs and corn bread is something to die for! It's not a fancy dining spot, but definitely a place to quench your thirst for some thanksgiving flavors!"}
{"text":"9/7/2013

This is a good place for lunch; clean; reasonable prices; good service, friendly employees; not much to say...it's a chain.   We did like ordering and then having someone bring our meal to us at a table.  Is that normal for a Boston Market?  The 1/2 chicken and sides I ordered were good.  The ribs my wife ordered were good, but with a bit too much sauce slathered on top."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick snack. The staff was nice and helpful and extremely quick. The Mac and cheese was really good and the kids meal had huge portions."}
{"text":"I order here every other week. The food is good and consistent and customer service was good. I'm currently loving the Chicken Marsala with three piece dark meal."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. I like the fact they give you real plates and forks if you are dining in; not paper plates and plastic forks.
Better than any fast food place in the area. A main dish, two sides and a large drink for approximately $10 to $11 is a good value in my opinion for the quantity and quality of the food.
I think Boston Market is a healthier alternative to your typical burger fast food restaurant.
I have read some reviews that said the service wasn't good at this location; however, I eat here a few times a month and have always been treated well with friendly, smiling faces that are happy to help."}
{"text":"Always a savior on the holidays! Also, be sure to ask for the puppy treats if you have your dog in the car with you when you go through the drive-thru, since they'll sometimes have little dog biscuits for them!"}
{"text":"If you want a nice case of food poisoning then I highly recommend this place! My boyfriend  and I were so sick last night and today.   We definetly won't eat here ever again!"}
{"text":"Usually good service and personable staff.  Food is pretty much what you would expect at any Boston Market.  When the manager's are around, it seems like the food quality and readiness is better, but I guess that's to be expected I suppose..."}
{"text":"Not one person serving food was wearing gloves. When I asked them, they said they have never worn gloves and were never trained to wear gloves. They were serving the food. The girl ringing up the purchase was closing lids and touching food as well as money. They had overflow food (?) or what looked like from from a stockroom on the counters by the tables. I tried to call corporate and there was no place to leave a message. The place was filthy. Disgusting and totally unsanitary. I will be notifying the health inspector."}
{"text":"I got a half dark chicken with the Tuscan sauce. The chicken was almost as dry as jerkey. It didn't look at all like the ads."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean, very friendly. Manager obviously cares about the brand and how customers feel when they eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was really good tasting of course but the stupid girl put our chicken, potato wedges, and fuckin apple slices all mixed together in one bowl soooo dumb!"}
{"text":"I visited the store and was very very disappointed. 5 servings trays were empty. The special promotion of Cod fish was not available the help said it would take 7 minutes."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight and it was very good. The food was fresh, the employees were pleasant."}
{"text":"Stopped in on 10/21/2016 at 5 pm. This Boston Market is set up differently than the one I usually go to. This one wants you to pay first, which is weird since is kinda set up like a cafeteria. The food I could see did not look fresh so who knows what the food looked like behind the hoods. It's 5 pm you would think they would have put fresh food out for the dinner time customers.  We did not stay, we left.  I noticed that most if their reviews are really old, I hope this helps."}
{"text":"On our vacation to Phoenix we stopped by to eat here . Everything was ok until I discovered a ROACH mashed with my creamy spinach!!! You can only imagine how gross was that for all of us. Since then I can't even look at the spinach! They got my info - told me they will contact me but never did! No letter of apology for serving roaches on my vacation, nothing! Gross ."}
{"text":"Very nice location, but they definitely need to make some changes. I had the manager take my order and her hair was everywhere and she had on no hair net or hat like the other workers, so I politely requested to have someone else take my order, I could take that clearly she was offended but she obliged nicely and had another young lady round up my food. My draw back was that I had to ask at all, as a manager you should never look like you've been outside running and sweating and then want to handle someone's food, you should look better than all the employees and set standards. 

The manager advised me that all managers don't have to wear hair nets or hats, which is fine, but you definitely shouldn't be on the food line then.....so for that they get 3 stars. The food was good and I have no complaints but I won't be driving back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had our Thanksgiving catered here. It was such a good decision,  would do it again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We come to this location often and have never had a bad experience with the staff or food. The kids love the food and I love that I don't always have to cook. We will definitely continue to come back. We have witnessed some pretty nasty customers and the staff handled it with respect."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst meal I have eaten at BM.  They seem to have perfected the art of raising and serving nearly meatless chickens.  Overlooked and nearly tasteless.  This place makes Popeye's look gourmet.  Not returning .  You were warned."}
{"text":"Staff is polite and good with order accuracy. The ribs were cold though. The mac n cheese is amazing though and they've got good coupons"}
{"text":"Nice area and very public service friendly. The restaurant is clean, the staff are very kind and polite, and the sandwiches are rocking! Definitely a home cooked alternative to the fast food competitors. Service with a can do attitude and smile. This is one place that truly appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"Don't ask me why I'm doing a review of Boston Market at ten minutes to 7 in the morning.

This location is convenient because it's in the plaza where I work.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't go there, but not because it's bad.  It's just...well, it's ok.

I used to love Boston Market when I was younger and it was called Boston Chicken...or maybe that was Kenny Roger's Roasters.  It doesn't matter.  It's the same thing: roasted chicken with fattening sides.

Now they have seemingly \"healthy\" sides -- like a caesar salad or green beans covered in butter sauce.  Blecch.

I usually stop in under one of two conditions:

1-I forgot lunch and need something quick and cheap.  I will usually grab something from their \"$5 Favorites\" menu (they have a chicken or turkey \"carver\" sandwich on multi-grain bread that's pretty good).

2-I didn't plan ahead for dinner and, again, need something quick and cheap.  I usually think this is more healthful than McDonald's or Burger King and you get more food.  Like a whole chicken and about a million sides which taste good until they get to room temperature....oh, let's face it.  I'd rather have McDonald's but that's another thing on my Murtaugh List."}
{"text":"The first time i have ever been to this Boston Market. They greet you nicely when you walk in. The restaurant is very clean.....Lots of different food cooked and in stock. Smelled wonderful in there. I got the chicken pot pie, roasted chicken, green beans and mash w gravy. As well as the lemon spinach and corn bread.  Tasted a little of every thing  and everything was wonderful. Love it!"}
{"text":"This one is for you Daniel.  Happiness. 
I had to be at work for an evening shift on this day. So I stopped by Boston Market on my way home from running errands. I had never been to this location. I actually had not been to Boston's in over a year.
Anyway, this one is on the way home, so I gave it a try.
Lots of parking, very clean inside. So we are off to a good start.
I ordered a few different items to go. I got the Chicken pot pie, which is great because , it only has a crust on the top.  
Also I got The dinner plate with ribs and chicken. Well received, and it came with 2 sides. I also got the roasted chicken dinner. It comes with 2 sides and I got a cranberry sauce on the side.
I really wanted to get one of the Anderson Cooper lunches. Which is the Turkey dinner with the Cranberry sauce. Anderson eats one every week day for lunch. The nice young man taking my order had no idea what I was talking about, but was happy to get me a Cranberry sauce. 
Hahaaa good times.
I would come back , all the food was very good and very reasonable."}
{"text":"The chicken caesar salad gives this place one more star!! AMAZING! 

Imagine a plentiful bed of romaine,croutons and cheese. Normal. 

NOW picture the Boston Market roasted chicken on it! It just bumps the salad up to a whole other level. Best chicken on a salad ever."}
{"text":"Good food, a large variety of food to choose from. Prices reasonable. 
The temperature and portions are very good. Appearance of food very appetizing. 
Undergoing remodeling, but staff is always polite and professional."}
{"text":"Shitty. That white boy with long hair wouldn't give me his name and continued to argue with me after I asked for a name. He had me fearing for my life"}
{"text":"I arrived at 4:45 pm on a Tuesday I ordered 3 meals to go.... 1 meatloaf and 2 chicken strip meals.... I was told rudely that they were out of strips... and I asked when they were going to have them ready... the girl asked the cook who said 20 minutes....I figured I will wait... she said have a seat.... now mind you, this is at the beginning of dinner rush and people are getting off work and stopping to pick up dinner for their families!   This must be a new crew.... as I have been here many times in the past!   No productive communication between employees!  In this type of service industry, each employee is a key player in keeping the product available, and the orders executed timely and efficiently.  That was not the case today.  After waiting patiently for a little over 20 minutes and 3 customers were waited on in the interim.... the strips were just about to be brought out of the oven, when the female food prep announced very loudly that they were out of meatloaf and it won't be ready for another 20 minutes... loud enough that everyone in the lobby heard.   I asked her if she put aside my order since I have been there over 25 minutes already.   She abruptly told me no, that I will have to wait.   Seriously????   I have never been so irritated... they filled 3 customers orders while I waited on mine and still did not have my order.  No apologies, no concern... just snide attitude!   I'm not a person to raise my voice or cause a scene.... maybe I should have.  But I told her to cancel my order and stormed out!   You wasted my time, you were rude and insensitive to the needs of your customers! It was not that busy...there were 6-7 employees on duty.... so staffing was not an issue!   I sure hope that mgmt can get it together.  I have always enjoyed the selection Boston Market offers!  Now let's put the Service back in Customer Service."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks dirty and greasy inside.  All the side dishes looked like they had been sitting there for days.  The flavor of the food was good tho.  But the restaurant needs a makeover and a good cleaning"}
{"text":"God forbid you walk in 30 minutes before they close! There was a snobby teen girl there who you could tell was easily glaring at us and complaining about us to other coworkers. Yeah, having customers suck, because then you'd have to work...boo hoo! That's what a job is! It means you WORK! We left about 5 minutes from closing, so I don't see why all this drama even happened! Managers, you need to hire some more PROFESSIONAL people, not young bimbos!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is your best option for food on Nellis. The staff has always been prompt, courteous and clean. I eat here multiple times per week and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved the Tuscany seasoned chicken but they quit serving it at this location. The bathrooms sure could stand to be cleaned and no soap! Lovely"}
{"text":"This is actually a really good Boston Market if you ask me.

I have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion. One young gentleman named Trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went. He checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed. I was quite impressed!

The food is also always really good at Boston Market. The brownies are addictive! I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants. I also like their drink cups a lot!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Boston Market used to be my favorite food chain particularly for their sweet potato casserole. Now that and a few of the sides carry an up-charge. We ordered turkey dinner and deboned chicken dinner. Everything was cold. So they brought plates to the back and microwaved them. Food was ok now that it was hot. Guess part of the disappointment was my own fault since I refused to pay the up-charge (why I gave the second star) But overall below average meals."}
{"text":"This BM's gone downhill.

I frequent this location a lot and it used to be really great. The previous middle aged manager was super friendly, and seemed to go out of his way to give you the best food and service possible. Unfortunately, it looks like there's a new younger manager and I haven't seen the previous manager at this location for a few months now.

On my last visit I got some really poor cuts of turkey meat, like bottom of the barrel scraps. The mashed potatoes were stale and had hardened crusty tops. I actually had to throw it out as it was really unappetizing. (It was takeout so I wasn't able to go back to the counter and ask them to serve up fresher stuff)

Pretty disappointed since this location is the close to me and it's a shame a lot of the staff that made it great and kept the quality up seem to have moved on. If there's a new location the previous manager went to, I'd love to know where."}
{"text":"Listen man eat here. The food is super good and the workers are super nice. Makes you feel at home and eating healthy food that tastes good is just a win."}
{"text":"Love Boston market!  Came to this location and the first person who came up to me, ( girl with blue hair ) ignored me when I had a question then made a rude comment to the customer next to me while she restocked the fresh food. It was very unprofessional. But however, there was a lady by the name of crystal who went above and beyond to make sure I got everything I needed! I left her a tip for her awesomeness."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. The quality of food is no longer there. I was happier when it was more like fast food. I'll clean my table just make food better."}
{"text":"We come to this location quite often and were really disappointed today the service was super slow the chicken we got was old wrinkly and dry the cornbread look old like it had been sitting there there were plenty of people around but look like only one was really actually helping customers until a huge line finally formed and the others did not have a choice but to follow in and work"}
{"text":"I wish Seattle had a Boston market. We eat here every time we visit Phoenix. Great service and great food. I got the rosemary lemon chicken and my fiancé got prime rib on a Friday. Super clean restaurant and the employees were very attentive to your needs. If you are in need of comfort food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good chicken...sides a bit dry. The bathroom smelled so bad it made me not want to eat. That's NOT ok. I would recommend fixing that at once, major turn off."}
{"text":"I went to Boston Market, Solon, tonight for take-out.  Very efficient and friendly staff behind the counter except when I ordered, there were no green beans or mixed veggies ready so I had to wait.  I don't not mind waiting.  A couple came in while I was waiting and ordered and then they were also waiting on the green beans.  After about 7-10 minutes, the manager, who was busy filling a large group order, asked the couple what they were waiting on?  They responded green beans.  The manager totally ignored me standing there waiting.  Mind you, I was waiting 5 minutes on two veggies before the couple even walked into Boston Market but the manager didn't bother to ask me what I was waiting for and he was up front most of the time filling the large group order.  I must be invisible.  The manager then offered the couple a brownie or cookie for their inconvenience.  At that same time, the veggies came out and I got my order and left.  Like I said, friendly and efficient staff even though they need to keep the side options filled for availability and no waiting but the manager definiitely needs to work on his observation skills.  I would have passed on the cookie or brownie but being made to feel like I am visible is not cool."}
{"text":"Food was good, but did not appreciate having to ask for a table to be cleaned. Out of 10 tables, there were 4 occupied and all the rest had plates and were dirty.."}
{"text":"One word: dirty! Dirty! DIRTY! OK, maybe that's three words, but it gives you an idea of how grossed out I am.  My chicken and steamed veggies were alright.  The sweet potato casserole was amazing, and the only reason I am able to give the two stars I gave them.  To start with, the door handle to get into the place looked like it had never been wiped off, like it was too nasty to even touch.  Then, the dining room was filthy.  The booth we sat in had a sticky back, as in my husband put his arm across it and stuck to it.  The ledges between seat were covered with bits of food.  The seats were covered with material that looked like it'd lived in a garage, covered with streaks of black stuff.  To top it off, they didn't have any paper towels in the bathroom, so I'm pretty sure nobody was very intent on hand washing.  I don't think I'll be coming back, and if I do it won't be this location.  If I was a health inspector, they'd be in seriously deep shit.  I shudder to think what the kitchen was like.  I don't want to think about it.  I advise skipping it."}
{"text":"This location has the WORST customer service EVER! 

Month ago I tried to order through drive through and the guys in the restaurant started moaning in the speaker after one asked,\"how can I help you?\" Then they started kissing into the speaker so I just left! Ignorant idiots left alone will be idiots.

Today is first day I went back since being treated so wrong (because it's close and I'm in a hurry for work). Today the guy taking my order only let me order one thing when I had more to order, so told him I wasn't done. Geez??? Why just do that? So going to pay for everything I had to ring two separate orders. He said it was an \"accident\" ain't no accident when it's avoidable if he wasn't in such a rude hurry? No one was even behind me."}
{"text":"We often eat here when we are too busy to cook and it never disappoints. When you think about it, there are not very many places where you can get a reasonably healthy meal that is quick and affordable. Boston Market is one of the few places you can. 

The rotisserie chicken here is usually moist and flavorful. That may sound like no big deal, but cooking a chicken breast to the proper doneness is not easy. They give you two sides plus cornbread with most meals and you can go healthy with green beans and spinach or pig out with mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. The sides are generous and every one I've tried is great.

This will continue to be a mainstay for us at dinner time."}
{"text":"Best service! Raul is possibly the sweetest person I have encountered lately! He made sure our order was correct and he was kind and courteous. He needs a raise!"}
{"text":"First I should say that this review doesn't reflect the service of the employees.  They were great.  
Boston Market recently came out with a rib or rib/chicken combo.  Both myself and my husband decided to try the rib/chicken combo.  Did NOT LIKE the ribs at all (they are st louis style and they have a horrible texture, too much fat and not enough meat and the sauce is lousy.  Actually didn't like the chicken too much either  :(
Our sides were the garlicky lemon spinach and mac and cheese and both these were very good as was the biscuit.  For what you pay this meal is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Giving it a 3/5 since I would really rate \"fast food\" chicken any higher than that... I've eaten here a couple times while doing business in Cleveland. Always had great customer service and chicken and food was always fresh. Interestingly, it was always pretty empty whenever I stopped in for lunch on weekdays. Hope it's still in business the next time I'm out there!"}
{"text":"I have faith in Boston Market again.
This location was clean, friendly, atmosphere and comfortable temp to dine in.
Very helpful and patient employees when ordering. 
Chicken pot pie (only top crust) was warm/hot, tasty good and filling.
1/2 chicken and sides great filling, tasty combo.
Employees kept coming around making sure if needed anything.
Easy access parking lot also.
Will come back again and just this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic 
Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Food was tasty and lots of options. They don't have a boneless option but offered and did take the chicken off the bone! Not pushy or in a hurry to serve and ring, laid back. Helps when you still deciding 
Will visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I will never never never understand why my order is always messed up when I visit. I walk in, wait patiently in line. I'm asked what I would like to order. My order taker walks away. She comes back and asks me again what I would like to order. I ask for green beans. She puts mixed vegetables on my plate. She asks again what I would like. I repeat my order. I ask for turkey with gravy on the side. She adds gravy to my turkey as I say- no, no gravy, please. I get the glare. She walks away. My food sits on the counter as there is no cashier to ring me up. This isn't an isolated incident. I was there a few weeks ago but my order wasn't wrong. I didn't get a chance to order. They were out of turkey. They were out of meatloaf. They were out of prime rib. They were out of pot pies. I'm pretty sure they were out of chicken too. No, it wasn't Easter. No it wasn't dinner time. Just a typical day at a poorly run Boston Market. Bummer."}
{"text":"I was craving turkey and mac and cheese on my way home from work and decided just to stop here and pick it up. The place was clean and smelled so good. The girl taking my order was new so another employee was helping her. Fast and friendly service. Food was EXACTLY what I was craving. Tasted so good. The price I paid for the food was definitely worth it and unbeatable. Cornbread was on point."}
{"text":"It had been several years since I was at a Boston Market. If I had to go anywhere for \"fast\" food this would be it. My boyfriend and I had tried the one in Greentree not too long ago and I fell in love all over again. I was even more thrilled looking in yelp to find out they deliver with Grub Hub! We've ordered twice in the last few weeks and everything has been awesome. A restaurant that stays true to its roots! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I always think their food is too salty but we come here on occasion.  They now bring your order to you and the food is served on plastic, washable plates rather than the disposable ones.  I like the chicken but like I said it's just all on the salty side for me."}
{"text":"I stop here a few times a month.  I work out a lot and then the last thing I want to do is cook at home.  I get the turkey and my better half gets the Chicken.  The food is good and the sides always appear to be fresh.  I wish they had real tea though.  I am a fan of fresh brew tea.  Some times they can get backed up and you can end up waiting a few minutes.  Great for food if you are in a hurry.  Plus it is better than fast food burgers and fries."}
{"text":"In the sordid world of fast food chains Boston Market is like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, a hooker with a heart of gold. The store is clean, the food is good (and can be good for you) and the service is never lacking. 

This particular location wins points from me due to it's location. It just so happens to be right between my gym and my office, making any post-workout protein cravings a no brainer. 

The main dishes are always consistent. I usually opt for the turkey, but the other meats are well prepared as well. The sides can be hit or miss, depending on how long they've been out or who prepared them. Typically the simpler the side the harder it is to screw up. Go green beans! 

The service is friendly and efficient. Usually my food is done by the time I've gotten my drink. You can't really go wrong with that speed. 

If I ever need to gnaw on a hunk of meat after a gym session Boston Market will continue to be my spot."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Great staff, very friendly. Service was top notch.  They do free \"seconds\" on the soup....awesome!   Food was good. Plenty of choices. Reasonable prices.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious! I would come here for lunch every day if I could! Their chicken is delicious mashed potatoes delicious macaroni and cheese delicious and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"A big shout out the the Easter crew who worked their tails (sorry) off to fulfill in store and online catering orders amidst the chaos of all of us whose plans changed at the last minute or who failed to make plans for a holiday feast day! You all rock. Food was as well prepared and assembled as always with attention to detail and courtesy even in the face of some grumbling customers. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Always love Boston market - this location is no different. Got the rotisserie chicken dinner bowl through the drive through and it was a good sized portion"}
{"text":"This Boston Market has great service and the staff was very friendly. After dinner my girlfriend and I were sitting and talking one of the staff even came by and cleared our table, asked if we needed anything. Above and beyond in my opinion for this type of restaurant. 

I usually get the apples but there were none on the line. I asked and if they aren't out they make them to order...just ask."}
{"text":"The food is like any other Boston Markets so take that FWIW.  The service though was pretty good at this location.  Very nice young man who was polite and helpful.  I would definitely come here again.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I usually get my food to go or by the drive-thru window. I've never had a bad experience. I eat here, because I know I'm getting fresh, tasty food. I wouldn't go as far to say 'home cooked' nevertheless it's still good at the sane time. The chicken, turkey, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach are some favorites of mine. The drive-thru is usually quick. I once picked up some chickens that weren't called in until that morning, and they had them ready for me. When you need something a little different and not greasy, Boston Market is your place."}
{"text":"I love Boston Market!

This location is right near Shadyside Hospital in the Bloomfield, Shadyside area of Pittsburgh. This location has a large sit down area and a drivethru if your in a hurry to get your food. They are always nice and the food always tastes great! I get the same thing everytime I'm here. No need to look at the menu. I always get the 3 Piece Dark Individual Meal. A rotisserie chicken meal that comes with one thigh and two legs and two sides. I always get mac & cheese, creamed spinach and sweet potato casserole as my sides.

Yummo!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. If you are getting carry out, you'd be wise to double and triple check your order as they NEVER get it right!!!"}
{"text":"Three pieces of roasted chicken, a good size delicious Caesar salad, tasty cornbread, and a scrumptious sweet potato dish that I would shove your grandma out of the way to get to first, all for $6.79. Are you kidding me? This is the gold standard of the fast food world!

Is it fine dining time at the Boston Market? Of course not, but it is pretty stellar for fast food. Me likey."}
{"text":"For many years I thought Boston Market was a \"Market\" and didn't bother coming in because it was too small of a \"Market\". That was until I met my future wife who worked at a Boston Market and then realized that it was a restaurant, silly me.  

Boston Market is one of those places that reminds you of a home cooked meal. When you're feeling down and about and missing some moms home Cooked meal, this should be the place to visit. 

Now, unto the food. BM is known for their chicken. Usually what most people order. They do also have turkey, ribs, meat loaf- which I was not too fond of here.  Occasionally they have specials and they will have other main dishes available.  Next, they offer many different sides, mac n Cheese/Brussel sprouts/ veggies/ and many others.  Mac n cheese is by far one of the best ones.  
If you get the chicken, ask for Dijon sauce on the side, goes great with the chicken.  

Last part, in my current state of mind, they have the BEST Pecan Pie- prove me wrong and I will remove the last statement."}
{"text":"Having the Mediterranean chicken salad for the first time.  Not very Mediterranean, but i like it and it's enough for two.  This is a nice store, in a nice area, with nice people.  The real deal is if you go in on a week night, you get a coupon good for the weekend, buy a meal and a 32 oz drink, get a 2nd entree free.  So turkey lunch, salad dinner, for around $10.

I like that you can eat healthy here. I'd like to know how they get the turkey so moist.  I get the turkey because of that, even though i would rather have the chicken (all dark, too much fat!).  You can get chicken noodle soup as a side, and I like the green beans (i like sweet potato but it's a bit too sweet, which is only bad because of the added calories).  and corn bread for desert."}
{"text":"One would typically think that going through a drivethrough may somewhat insinuate someone might be eating in the car! Hub ordered a chicken sandwich (plain, only cheese), myself, 3 small sides (corn, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese). We are told this will be 17 dollars!? Wow! So this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so? So, when we get the window, it's actually 13. Okay, that's better. As we pull off to head to our event for the evening, we open the bag to find there is no fork, no napkins, and  his sandwich is the absolute farthest thing from \"Plain\". Sauce ran off the wrapper into his hand. Crap, if only we'd had a napkin!?
If you come here check your order well, and if planning non inside dining, bring your own silverware and napkins! Or swear and run across to the Fry's deli across the street for the items."}
{"text":"What can I say that already hasn't been said of this American icon of a restaurant.  I love me some rotisserie chicken and my usual staple here is the Chicken Carver Sandwich combo.  They have lots of sides to choose from, my new fav is the loaded mashed potatoes! Cheese bacon bits delicious! 

I've not had any service issues or anything at this location, they are on top of it and very fast!!  So instead of Wendy's/McDonald's/BK and the usual, give ol Boston Market a shot if you haven't in a while. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Huge reliance on spices. Lack of freshness. Overkill on certain items to add taste, such as unnecessary breading in the squash casserole. Sweet Potatoe casserole had too much sugar. Parm Tuscan chicken had too much sauce but good flavor. Green beans were great flavor but chewy. Mac n cheese tasted processed as well. We came In dinner rush so there is no reason the veggies should have been chewy. Good prices. Friendly staff. I would not recommend this place unfortunately. However, I've only gone once."}
{"text":"Great service everyone was super friendly. The food was hot, fresh and it tastes great. The restaurant was clean and the prices were affordable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often due to the delicious food and super friendly staff! I'm not sure of her name but this blonde women I see every time I go into Boston Market is always very happy and always makes conversation, she's so wonderful :) I love BM!! Thanks staff for always making my Friday or Saturday night even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've experienced better. I'm not sure if Boston Market is just in a decline in the valley. I'm originally from the east coast though I've spent nearly two decades living in San Diego on the west coast. 

The offerings here at Boston Market in Scottsdale really reminded me of... Not home. I had fond memories of Boston Market growing up going there on the occasional weekends with the family. The quantity of food provided has largely shrunk and some of the food just has a weird chemical-y taste.

Looking at the other reviews on here for Boston Market at this specific location, it looks like other reviewers are giving the place less than 3 star reviews as well. Go figure."}
{"text":"Great place to pickup a tasty home style dinner.  We typically get the chicken, loaded potatoes, and green beans.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great employees but got food poisoning from their food. Will never eat at a Boston market again."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Boston market.    Very impressed with the staff, food selection and freshness of the food.  

The Santa Fe bowl with rotisserie chicken was awesome.

The atmosphere was very pleasant and definitely   5 star for basically a fast food restaurant.

The table was really clean and they did not use a rag out of dirty pan of dishwater to wipe the table down."}
{"text":"Don't come here unless all you want is chicken, they didn't have any ribs or meatloaf. Won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is another chain that used to be the only show in town. I have not been to one in years, but stopped here to lack of safe dining options in the area. They have a buffet of sorts behind the counter with all the side dishes. Did not try the cornbread or get a platter, but if you add a combo the sandwich then you are looking at over 10 bucks for lunch. Turkey is probably the better choice for a sandwich, but I ended up with the ole Chicken Carver at $7. Nothing to write home about as the pulled chicken was cold (was it supposed to me?) and the bun was a store bought kind of French roll. They slathered honey mustard on that bread (unknown to me at order) and I still needed to use the BBQ sauce at the table to get some flavor. The BBQ sauce is another story also - there are about 100 artificial ingredients in that bottle if you care about that stuff. Might give the turkey one more chance in the future."}
{"text":"I could not believe how small the chickens are now.  I usually order the chicken meal for 5 and the chicken used to require 2 containers for 1 and a half chickens.  Now it fits in one container with room to spare.  The prices keep getting higher, but the chickens keep getting smaller!
No longer a good value for the money!"}
{"text":"Riley was really great! Super excited to find this since we don't have it in Iowa but I grew up with it as a special treat. Not sure what the point of online ordering is since they just do it regularly so it's kind of needless to do."}
{"text":"This location continues to excel at messing up drive through orders. It's actually quite impressive because consistency like this can take years to attain. Regardless of what you order- something will not make it home with you. Much like AZ sports teams- while you have great hopes- you will continue to be disappointed. 

You win Boston Market. I know I should just bring my lunch and eat better blah blah- but you keep reeling me back in. This time it's over- I want your stuff gone by the time I get home. For realz (when you see a Z you know its serious business)"}
{"text":"I love this quick service chain. Most meals & sides are excellent. STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATLOAF !!
They changed the recipe for it and it is terrible. All other meals are Great and this particular lovation is very clean and efficiently run. Staff is polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Made a stop here today for a early dinner. Chicken and bread was cold when I got it. The staff was nice enough to bring us some warm chicken to replace the pieces we had. This location is a bit run down and needs some work. I will not be going back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"The interesting thing about this place is that they bring your meals to you on real plates and you get real silverware if you eat there! So crazy! I have never seen that at a Boston Market. Everyone was extremely friendly and they cleaned up your table after you're done (no tips expected!). My coworker thought her veggies were cold so they bought her out a new plate. The service is above and beyond at this place, but I just wish the food was as fresh as most of the other Boston Markets I've been to. The food here was just so-so in comparison."}
{"text":"When I moved here 8 months ago, I was overwhelmed by the amount of places to eat.  I ended up trying numerous \"trendy\" offerings around the area, but always came back to Boston Market. It is now my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  So consistent in food quality and serving size and the employees are always outstanding. 

I never leave this place disappointed and I am always full!"}
{"text":"Got chicken from Boston Market. It was a stale. the whole chicken was cut into pieces, didnt feel like it was a whole chicken. Will go there again but i am kind of hurt, since this is my fav restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Boston Market for years.  Consistent Quality in food and service.  However this store has changed dramatically.  Last night i decided to bring home B.M. for the family.  The macaroni was over cooked, the chicken cold, but it was was late when i got there.  Even though they miss made my salad last night, I decided to give them another chance.  

So tonight I returned. They didn't seem to care that last might was an error, nor did i push the fact.  However when they repeated the mistake again tonight, I had to call them out.  I guess the consistency has remained, but the quality is lost.  When i showed the clerk the salad was wrong, she said the guy was new.  So i gave her the menu sitting on the counter and and asked her to show the guy what went in it.  So he through on two handfuls of onions and told me they were out of the other ingredients.  I had to ask for my money back and left with no salad.  The manager - Dan didn't really seem to care.

I will not return to this store until its management changes.  Over the years i have been there dozens of times.  Now it has fallen below the minimal acceptable standard.  I hope all the Boston Markets are not of this quality now and that this was just an aberration.  It was two nights in a row and we are done with our local store."}
{"text":"This is a particularly bad Boston market. Came for lunch and they were either out of most of the sides or they'd been sitting under the heat lamps so long that they were awful. Also, I ordered the three piece chicken and got two legs that were smaller than the average wing and the smallest thigh I've ever been served. And they were understaffed and the staff they had was borderline incompetent... definitely slow as hell. Anybody needing chicken or home style food would do better to go a block away and get something at the fry's grocery store."}
{"text":"Boston Market is a bit of a nostalgic treat for me. I remember coming here when I was younger - way back before the place was remodeled with nice, comfy lounge tables instead of high top chairs - and begging my mother to let me get chicken with Mac and cheese and potatoes, with my poor mother fighting with me to get me to eat my veggies all the way.

These days I have no problem eating the vegetables here. Our little selves don't always know what they're talking about, which was definitely the case here: everything here is seasoned and cooked really well and is pretty delicious, from the mashed potatoes to mixed veggies to the meatloaf and chicken. You do get the occasional dry chicken, but overall the chain has really mastered its recipes and knows what it's doing. It's even introduced a line of pretty good sandwiches and meal bowls. Kind of wish those had been around when I was a kid!

But let's get real, for lots of us there's one reason to go to Boston Market above all others. I mean, their sandwiches are ok and all, and even the chicken's pretty decent most of the time - but OH MAN, the Mac & Cheese. The Mac & Cheese is worth an entire extra star in my book and bumps Market up from a 3 to a 4. It's wonderfully cheesy and delicious and just makes me happy! Mac & cheese is my comfort food, and sometimes all you want is a nice big bowl of wonderful comfort food.

Really that's what Boston Market is when you get down to it: yummy comfort food. But hey, sometimes even the best of us need a giant plate of comfort food, and there's nothing wrong with that! What else can I say? It's hard to screw up classic comfort dishes, and on that front Boston Market's definitely got you covered."}
{"text":"Basic Boston Market.   It's becoming a little dated, but it's still clean and acceptable.   The food was average except that the dressing was a little cold. Otherwise it was about what you'd expect from Boston Market."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location a few times. I'm sorry but this place is the worst ! Their food is always old. It also seems if you ask them to put out fresh Mac and cheese or mashed potatoes they have an attitude as well. When you pull into the location, the employees are standing outside in the open smoking with their uniform ON !!! && then when they see you approach closer, they'll run inside and stand behind the counter. I don't believe they even wash their hands after the smoke break. I love Boston Market but this particular location has the worst food. They don't seem to care what they serve their customers ! I'd rather not call and complain either because they won't do anything anyway ! Maybe offer a free meal from that same location and it will be old as well"}
{"text":"oOoh been here once for dinner and about three times for lunch...it's really a great place for a quick and easy meal and it's not too fatty like other fast foods..and it's pretty cheap. 

I love their 3 piece dark meat rotisserie chicken that comes with a delicious cornbread (I'm usually not fond of cornbread) and two choices of sides. I've had the creamed spinach, corn, veggie mix, squash mix, roasted herb red potatoes and sweet yam which is my least favorite....the sweet yam casserole is just too sweet for my taste...so not a big fan of that one..other than that the other sides are pretty good. The meatloaf meal is also really good...two really good size slice of meatloaf also with a choice of two sides and a cornbread...2 bucks more expensive than the chicken but sometimes you want something besides chicken. heh

So for a quick easy cheap semi-healthy meal that does not consist of a hand full of grease (burgers, pizza, tacos of that sort..) then Boston Market is really a fantastic choice =)

Yummers!"}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've ate here but got a craving and stopped in.

The wait staff was prompt, courteous and looked like they genuinely enjoyed working there.  I was in and out in well less than 10 minutes.

The food, ordered to go, was really good.  We had the 3 person chicken dinner with sides of stuffing, corn, and red potatoes.  The meal comes with corn bread as well.  
Total with tax came to 23.28.    

Chicken was tender and tasted very fresh.  In fact it all tasted really good.  Obviously it is a well run restaurant for it's class."}
{"text":"Clearly not romaine lettuce in a Caesar salad. Don't use iceberg lettuce when your menu clearly states romaine. Very disappointed. How do restaurants get away with it? Creamed spinach delicious and that's what gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"Our family always has a fun time when we visit here.  The staff is nice and
they serve quickly.  Have no trouble using our coupons here.

Food is very good.  Nice selection.  Wish they had fish"}
{"text":"I truly feel my life is more complete after eating here!! Turkey, creamed spinach and sweet potato casserole..... yes... life is more complete now!!"}
{"text":"I love Boston market and am a bit bias I must say..... every thing here is fantastic !!! I will be using there thanksgiving catering next year as well!!! no more all day cooking for me!!!"}
{"text":"This is your typical Boston Market.  I met my husband here for lunch one day last week. I had the roast turkey and he had the meatloaf. They were both pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I came here for lunch but, boy, I was happy I did.  I bought a chicken pot pie and it was the best pot pie I've ever had!  The service here is good too.  I'll be returning on more lunch breaks!!!"}
{"text":"Standard Boston Market.  No extra frills.  

I've been here twice, getting fast service without much complaint.

Fast food -- always standardized."}
{"text":"Come early for dinner else you'll be in a long line.  I like that they take internet orders, so I order from my car on the way there with my Droid, and go right to the front and pickup my order.

The food is good, and the service is good.  Nice people. Nice atmosphere.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and I just had to write a review.   We walked in, immediately greeted, told about their specials, got our food very quickly and sat down to eat.  So, our food was pretty good, we had chicken, ribs, loaded mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese,  and cornbread.   The cornbread was amazing, moist, and very delicious.  The chicken was equally tasty, actually everything was very good, except my only complaint was the ribs were lacking of actual meat, they aren't the hearty ribs I was expecing and they were luke warm.  However, what made me 5 star this visit was their outstanding customer service.   The staff made us feel welcome, were extremely pleasant, I just can't say enough about how nice we were treated, they get 5 stars just for that!  It's becoming more and more difficult these days to find somewhere to go where the employees actually give a hoot about customer service.  That alone will make us go back again and again.    My only other critique, would be that of the lady walking around the place with her cell phone attached to her head, I'm guessing she was the manager and she was also was sitting in the eating area set up with her briefcase and again on her cell phone.  I don't think it's entirely appropriate for that to be ok.  Isn't there an office she could have went into, or at the very least pick the furthest table/booth away from customers view as much as possible, just sort of unprofessional in our opinion.   All in all, we'll be back, glad they are still around."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this location. I ordered 4 bowls of chicken and turkey with side of gravy and corn bread. When they gave me my to go order I assumed everything was inside including spoons, napkins, etc. When I got home (which isn't too close to the Boston Market) I noticed they forgot my gravy and cornbread AND silverware! Not sure what the reason was, it's not like the location was busy or full of people. Debating if I'll come to this location again..."}
{"text":"This review is for catering orders:

I cater meals for my clients a few times a week and I used Boston Market on McClintock last week. Had a fantastic experience. The food was prepared for me upon arrival and my clients loved the food and were very satisfied. The price was extremely affordable compared to local competition and it's the perfect lunch option for catering when you have clients sick of pizza, subs and wraps. The staff at this location is astounding. Extremely friendly and make you feel right at home for a pleasant experience. I will definitely be back. 

Details:
Served 11 people
Price: $80
Scheduled Pick up time: 11:30am


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Used to love picking up a quick, \"homemade,\" healthy dinner here.  This visit was not up to par.  The staff member who took our order and packed our dinner clearly didn't want to be working there and seemed annoyed at having any customers.  Food was not up to standards.  Roasted potatoes seemed like they were multiple days old with a very crunchy / almost plastic-y shell.  Mixed veggies were cold and super bland.  We saw the staff take a vacuum sealed package of turkey and throw it in the microwave before cutting it open and putting it on our to-go plates.  Not sure if this is standard procedure or not, but I had thought Boston Market was bit more \"homecooked\" than microwaved.  Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"So this place is close to me, yet I had not tried it before until just this Summer. Not a bad place at all. it is easy to get to ,located right on the corner. It is very clean inside. 
The staff is friendly and helpful, they can answer all the questions about the food and how it is made.
I got my order to go. Because, I just wanted to get home. Who doesn't after a long day working in BedRock.
Loved the food. it is still hot in the containers they put it in. Even after I drove home and took a shower, it was still hot.
I will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Turkey dinner for 3 review

Pros:  The corn bread, green beans, and creamed spinach were delicious.  

Cons:  The turkey was dry, the gravy was uninspired, and the apple pie is almost unedible.  I will definitely try something else next time."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Boston Market and there is not one near my home.  When I travel I like to frequent them if they are convenient.  This one was right by the hotel and although I really liked the hotel restaurant how could I pass out a Boston Market?

Second night of my trip I got an order to go from here.  I know their specialty is chicken but I am a meatloaf man.  I got red skin potatoes and mac n cheese with my meatloaf.  Correct, the potatoes were my vegetables.  I took it all back to the hotel and watched football and relaxed.  Perfect meal and  end to a long day of conducting training sessions.

Now if they could just build one in Frankfort."}
{"text":"I don't have any Boston Markets close to where I live but boy does this one remind me of why I miss it! The food was delish and service was better than most restaurants I've been to. Hospitable doesn't even begin to tell the story. Will be back any time I'm visiting my fam in Solon!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Boston Market a long time ago.  Loved the chicken and the cole slaw, so went in just for that.  Guess what?  They don't make cole slaw anymore.  So I won't be a customer anymore.  Just ok."}
{"text":"Best sides dishes of any of its competition and the chicken ain't half bad either.  They have changed their service to ceramic plates and metal siverware if you eat in.  The chicken has always been good and the sides great for a fast food environment."}
{"text":"The staff does a pretty good job and were friendly.  The manager was a bit standoffish and could be more welcoming.  The problem is the food is TERRIBLE.  The ribs are frankly, tasteless and the texture is strange.  The chicken is also tasteless although it was cooked well.  The brisket and meatloaf are also bland and seemed like they had been sitting for hours.  Very disappointing since I spent $80.00 for a mini-buffet.  All of the sauces, meats and most of the sides have the same tasteless flavor, or lack thereof.  The only food that was somewhat okay was the sweet potatoes.  Skip this place for any kind of meal."}
{"text":"Where's the beef?

Boston Market on a Friday night, thought I'd stop by for some quick comfort food before heading to the movies. It was not busy but they way they handled everything you would have thought it was packed. 

They must have some new employee issues because I got one taking my order. I ordered a carver sandwich. My child ordered mac and cheese of course. It seemed to be a language barrier when I said Brisket carver sandwich on WHEAT. She repeated back to me three times insisting I do the combo. Ok maybe it only comes as a combo so I say yes. She tells the cook  \"half beef on white\" and I quickly correct her. WHEAT please.  

Some sort of holdup and they say they will bring to it to the table for us.  We get our Mac N Cheese and drinks and sit. A few minutes later the 1/2 carver arrived wrapped and ready togo.  No au jus for dipping. No salad. Just a 1/2 sandwich. She says \"I'm sorry\" and realizes she forgot the rest of the order and quickly goes back to get the missing food. The manager comes by and asks what is wrong as he is apologizing to every table. He was the manager of \"I'm sorry\". She comes back with the food and leaves. The sandwich had 2 small skinny pieces of beef on it that did not even cover the roll. No swiss and no mayo. The au jus was warm at best. The salad was fine. I was extremely disappointed in the carver sandwich. For $6 I do think there should be meat on the sandwich. 

To be quite honest the last few times I have been to this location they are slipping. It will be a few months before I go back if I ever go back. The manager did bring me a one free corn muffin. Hint hint...Nice jester but dessert would have been better. 

Just very disappointed in the whole experience."}
{"text":"Very good place for a chicken dinner. 

My family stops in here about once every few months for a half chicken meal with sides. The chicken is great. We always seem to get fresh chicken that is hot and juicy. The sides are moderately good, depending on what you go for. I personally like the mashed potatoes but find the potato slices too dry. The mac and cheese is slightly more runny that I would prefer, but still pretty good nonetheless.  

The service is fine. Not amazing, but good. Sometimes they can be a bit slow to be honest. They are always friendly though. The only real negative about this location is the plaza that it sits in. The corner of 19th Avenue and Northern has always been hard to get in and out of, but with the light rail construction it is even more difficult now. 

Overall it is a good place to eat if you want a nice change of pace or you're just too tired to cook anything for dinner. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is disgusting..it's dirty, hot, and the staff are rude and very unhelpful.  They said they were open for xmas day (on the phone) but neglected to say they were only serving one meal. Upon arriving it looked more like a soup kitchen (speaking of the clientele) and the drive through is closed.  Next year, I suggest Boston Market go ahead and close for xmas...I won't  be back as a result of this experience, but why risk other customers."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times before work and they're quick!!  Prior to this, I hadn't been to a Boston Market in years!  The last time I was there, they had plastic forks and knives and plastic plates that was sectioned off for your food. Now...real silverware and real plates!!   Nice!  :)
I love that they offer bowls now too. They are the perfect size and you can get anything you want in it!  Hmmm.  All this talking is making me want to go now!!"}
{"text":"Our Thanksgiving plans got cancelled at the last  moment.  My husband drove here and picked up a delicious meal for the two of us.  All hands were on deck and he was in and out within 10 minutes.  The turkey was moist, the stuffing and mashed potatoes were flavorful and they gave us a free pie.  They' replaced their standard corn bread with hard dinner rolls.  If they didn't raise the cost of the meal to $35 (from  $27) because of the holiday, I would have considered this a 5 star meal for the occasion and price.  Wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"Only redeeming quality about this place is the food, always consistently good. Other than that the whole experience is terrible and the employees are incredibly unprofessional. Don't even bother ordering online because your order won't be ready when you get there and they won't have enough food to fulfill your order. Seriously save yourself some time and go to another location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always great and fresh and tastes home made. The servers are always nice and make sure you are taken care of. It's a nice balance of a sit down and fast food, because it's healthy, but also fast. And you don't get bothered every 10 seconds by a server. The servers at Boston Market just come by every 10 minutes or so to make sure everything's good and then clean up after you (if they're not super busy) I highly recommend this place. The loaded mashed potatoes and the sweet potatoes are delish, and as for the sandwiches I get the Mediterranean carver."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times their food is always amazing the service was absolutely outstanding I was in and out in less than 3 minutes I called ahead and order my food which is a great option they had it already waiting for me all I had to do is walk in and pay and go I had to add extra cornbread and they were very accommodating it was no extra hassle I would recommend this place to anybody the only reason I got four stars instead of five is cleanliness of the restaurant could use some cleaning"}
{"text":"First time at Boston Market. Needed a big meal for my crew who had to work on Easter and then decided to get one for my family so no one would have to cook. 

I arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday. I ordered a family meal for five and a family meal for six. They each came to about $45 since I added a pie for the five-meal. 

There were lots of options available so I chose to get chicken and turkey for one and meatloaf and turkey for the other. The sides were all good choices but I settled for Mac n Cheese, Steamed Veggies, Mashed Potatoes with Gravy and Sweet Corn.

The chicken was fork-tender, seasoned properly and it nearly fell off the bone. The turkey was also very tender, juicy and flavorful. 

It was an excellent meal and I highly recommend Boston Market."}
{"text":"I have alway love their food. Comforting and I can count of it tasting the same as long as I can remember. I alway get the 1/2 dark it's 3 sides. Green beans, corn, and mashed potatoes. Sometimes I'll add their Mac and cheese. Their chocolate cake is awesome! And now that they have Postmates to deliver and I'm grateful. This way I can have more of it since they're far from my salon and definitely far from home!"}
{"text":"I usually don't bother reviewing chains. Go ahead. Make fun of me. I get off on it. 

I came here today because: a) I forgot my lunch and b) I had some gift cards for donating blood last week. 

We already know about the food. It's nothing to rave about. 

In all seriousness, I felt I needed to review this Boston Market because of the people that work here. They were so freakin' nice that I just couldn't stand it.  Sure, they probably go through a rigorous customer service training program and it's probably beaten into their skulls daily just how nice and pleasant they must be to keep their jobs. I think that's sort of terrible but I'm glad they were so nice. I was obviously touched and (surprisingly) not annoyed by the 10 different hello's I received and the general happy chattiness by all who worked there. 

Hopefully their manager reads this and gives those poor kids a raise. They deserve it."}
{"text":"We went to Boston Market in Phoenix Az and we had the Prime rib it was very good, we wished it was a lot warmer!"}
{"text":"Food was good but disappointed that they only had 1 person to help us with a line...I don't understand how you only have 1 person to get orders while there's another at the back looking and another hardly doing anything...doesn't make sense if you ask me."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was not! One of the worst meals I ever had in a restaurant, the chicken just lacked any flavor at all, the potatoes dry, horrible, my kids had meals and same, no wonder we were the only ones in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Our family has a love/ hate affair with Boston Market.

In the early years, Boston Market was a hot property, as hot as Chipotle is now.  Back then, when it was know as Boston Chicken, the sight of those spinning chickens would make our mouths water.  

Then the dot com era burst and people didn't want to go out for something they could buy at their local grocery store.  And then, due to over expansion, Boston Market went bankrupt.

So now, if you are following along at home, this when McDonalds came in and bought the company and saved them.  I forget what state we were living in at the time, but it seemed that all the Boston Markets, but a few were closed over night.  

Today, we have a more upscale restaurant.  Not quite a wait-service place, but close.  You order, like always up front and someone will come by and deliver your meal to your table.  Nice!  They even have fancy napkins and everything.  How about those green tinted Coca-Cola glasses, eh? LOL

Where our family has a disconnect, is the more upscale price and somewhat diminished quantity; hence value for our money.  They've also change several standard menu items like stuffing and cream spinach for what benefit I cannot understand.  In retail, you don't fix things that aren't broken! 

The food is still good.  The service is even better and the menu is still mostly (with the above noted exceptions) unchanged.  It's just times have changed.  Fry's and every other supermarket offer a fully roasted chicken for $6.00, and those guys at Chipotle are growing exponentially.  And one of these days, the public is going to figure out that El Pollo Loco is just as good.

So, we don't come here as often as we would like.  It's just now, there are so many places in the crowded \"I don't feel like cooking tonight dinner market.\"  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Perfect Christmas Eve dinner of roasted chicken, corn, and mashed potatoes! Too bad they're closed on Christmas Day, otherwise I'd been getting that for dinner again tonight! 

I love that you can order a 3-piece DARK meat meal since I'm not a big fan of white meat. It has a wide selection of entrees and even sandwiches. This is the perfect place to go if you want a somewhat home-cooked meal with all the dressings. The service was great and I got my meal super fast; didn't have to wait at all. This is a perfect location since it's on my way home from work and easy to get to. yummy!"}
{"text":"Typically I like this location/chain just because it is a welcome break from your usual fast food burger. The prices are a little steep but the food is decent and the service is good.
Yesterday I ordered a turkey sandwich on white with no tomatoes. Luckily it is just an aversion to tomatoes and not an allergy because there were clearly tomatoes on it at some point based on all the seeds left behind. It seems like they forgot what they were dong and pulled them off. It could have been a ready made sandwich and they just pulled them off to accommodate my order but I don't think so.
Despite this...I will still go back."}
{"text":"I am usually very happy with there food , not so much this time . We got prime rib a $14.99 and there new bacon broccoli with some sort of vinegar sauce . The prime rib was 1/2 fat and very spicy on the outside with little to no flavor on the inside . The broccoli mixture was over done and way to salty . The workers were polite and fast I just don't plan on having that meal again .On The weekend usually can get a special buy one get one free if you check the Coupons online."}
{"text":"Worst chicken and all food i ever had from them. This was my first time visiting this location and will be my last time as well. I got my food to go and when i got home to eat it the 3 piece deal had more like just a little over 1 piece. The  2 small chicken legs had 2/3rds of one of them completely cut off and the chicken thigh was 1/2 of what a chicken thigh would have been. I took some of the skin off to eat first and it was burnt and not tasty at all. Roasted potatoes were just dry pieces of chewy potatoes, creamed spinach was almost ok however she served me the chewy edge that had baked under the hot light way too long. I really didn't like anything i had ordered except for the fountain drink i got and had very nice ladies take my order. This place was awful and maybe it was because it was about 30 mins before closing that the food was old, dry and in small half pieces. Picture is of the 3piece dark. I took one bite out if the upper leg. The other pieces are 2 sides cut off the leg and half a thigh, i guess that is how they see a 3 piece combo. Chicken dry and skin was burnt. AWFUL!!! No one else was there and i see why now. The guy had 15-20 whole chickens he was shredding and could have found better pieces to serve at 8:30pm."}
{"text":"My first visit to Boston Market in probably 10+ year. The service was good, the turkey was recommended and it was very moist and tasty. Sadly the tea was nasty. Completely undrinkable. I'm not sure when it was made but I'm guessing not today. I only drink tea or water so this is frustrating for me. It's hot so I order the biggest drink they have then end up filling it with free water. Ugh. Atmosphere-pretty non existent. It's not inviting at all. Will I be back? Maybe? Dunno...

Update: 
Then I arrive home and give my husband the cookie he wanted. He takes one bite and pulls out a hair that's baked into the cookie. Nasty! Change that to 'No, I won't eat here again'."}
{"text":"Ok, so let me begin by saying it has been many years since I have visited this place.... it was very very good!!! I had the baked chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy, stuffing & sweet potato casserole.
But what really made this dining experience was the excellent Customer service.. Derrick was the man, he went above & beyond & with such nice manners for a young man nowadays.
Pleased! Delicious"}
{"text":"Food is great.

However:

-Once there were two co-workers loudly arguing with each other while people waited in line to be served.

-Once I had a cashier actually tell me to leave a tip on the table after I was done eating.

The staff here needs to do better."}
{"text":"This location is very nice and clean compared to other ones I have been to. Perfect on a day you don't feel like making lunch or dinner! You get good serving sizes for the price and the food tastes better. You don't feel like you are eating fast food but more of a home cooked meal. 

The service was spectacular! Two different employees asked me to make sure I didn't need silverware. They were very friendly and on top of everything! They had a good amount of side selections, although the macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes are my favorite. If you never had their macaroni and cheese, you have to try it, it is really good and creamy!

The food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered the chicken and it was excellent. It was really fresh and juicy.  I would definitely reccommed this location!"}
{"text":"Our family won't be going back to Boston market any longer so now they have premium sides so now if you want to get either the mac & cheese or the sweet potato casserole you have to pay more money now for that so I decided that it's not worth my time or my money eating there anymore because the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have gone up !!! I've noticed ..so I'm gonna take my business elsewhere or start staying home and cooking and get back to real family life and family time....... damn I unsubscribed but I'm still getting emails from Boston market buy one get one free it's not worth me coming down to get a buy one get one free when I can't get the damn sides that I want that I have to pay more money for if I don't eat the other site it's not worth my time or my money to come down and to pay more money for the sites that I to eat and I do like so please stop sending me emails when I unsubscribe if I have to pay more for the sites that I wants I will not be a customer I'll go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Terribly unprofessional. Ghetto! Being a business owner myself,  the owner should be embarrassed to have these type of employees. As you run out of items on Christmas Eve, you laugh at customers as they walk out? Grow up! 

I was embarrassed as a customer to see them behave this way. Will NEVER give Boston's my money EVER again!"}
{"text":"Tried the new rotisserie potatoes. I went about 8 pm thru the drive up window and I think they had sat under the heat lamp for awhile. They potatoes were hard and burnt. Everything else was great as usual. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Great place to go for the nights I don't want to cook! They always seem to have fresh food out and ready to go around dinner time. Love the creamed spinach and the rotisserie chicken as well as the meatloaf. If you don't want to cook and want some comfort food, stop by this Boston Market. Clean too!"}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday and enjoyed it so much I went back on Thursday too.

I have never before this week dined at Boston Market! I don't know what I was waiting for this place is something special.  When you dine in they serve you on a real plate...not some plastic plate or out of boxes. That fact alone was enough to award 5 stars the plate was nice but the food on the plate was even better.  

They have two kinds of gravy beef and chicken
The food was excellent 
the ribs were so tender"}
{"text":"The chicken is fantastic and all the sides are great!! Prices you can't beat.. we go at least once a month.. my wife loves the turkey the best---"}
{"text":"Love this place for it's food. The service was superbly helpful in ordering and humorous personalities  to boot. Can't wait 'til my next visit!"}
{"text":"Good food, prices are good, and the place was very clean.  The girl at the register was very professional and pleasant. She even carried our plates to our seat."}
{"text":"The service was friendly here but I was overcharged for an extra side.  It was nice that the employee noticed and came to get me debit card to refund me.  They were out of the kale side I wanted but did enjoy the meatloaf and creamed spinach.  Not a fan of their beverage choices so just stuck with water."}
{"text":"Typical tasty Boston Market fare. Kind of hard to give a 5 star to a chain shop."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give even 1 star. Horrible service. I ordered family dinner for 4 plus 2 extra sides. I got sighs and eye rolls from the cook and the girl waiting on me. I got home and no extra sides. I paid for them but they didn't put them in the bag. I called and was told that they would send me a card for family dinner for 3 since they charged me for items not received. I called again on July 2nd as they never sent anything. I spoke with Autumn who advised me that she was a manager and would send out a gift card as previously promised. Still have not received. So if you choose this location make sure to check your order because they love to charge you for items you won't receive and have no follow through. I would be happy to get my 10.00 back. This started on June 24th. Terrible servce. We went there at least 1x a month and had no problem spending money, but I'd rather spend that 60.00 somewhere else. Mediocre food, horrible service, zero follow through. My advice, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Simply awesome! Great food at great price. Lobe this location! Thank you Boston Market!!"}
{"text":"First & last trip in one. We stopped to try something different for lunch. I got chicken sandwich with red potatoes & my husband got meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes & gravy. All our potatoes were cold & were in dire need of seasoning. The gravy had no flavor. The bread was so tough you couldn't eat the sandwich. The chicken was terribly DRY. Tea dispenser was water, not even any brown color. We got lemonade (taste more like Kool Aide). We wasted almost $20 on that lunch. Would not recommend Boston Market!!"}
{"text":"This was first time here and the food was actually not that bad. Shawn and Miguel were so amazing! They both were so friendly and because of them I'll be coming back. Keep up the good work! See you next time."}
{"text":"Very good custom service. Had a meal that wasn't so great, manager (Mike, I believe) made it right. Will give them another try."}
{"text":"It was so disappointing last night when my family and I decided to pick up dinner after one of those school concerts.  It was 8pm and there was NO CHICKEN.  I asked when they closed, and was told 9pm.  You have an entire hour left and no plans to make more?  While they were nice enough, I couldn't understand.  \"We got very busy earlier.\"  Ummm,  I'm not sure how long it takes to prepare one of the whole rotisserie chickens, but when they knew they were running out, why didn't they put more on?  I don't understand mismanaging the preparation of the very item you sell.  No excuses.  We ended up going to the New China Buffet on Andrews... one hour before closing, as well.  Yet the place was fully stocked and the service was nice. ~"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update that I've tried the pot pie again and really like it. It's so fresh, I love the crust and it hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place is great, same as I remember it from years ago when I worked near here. Food is fantastic, prices are not bad, and did I mention the food is fantastic?!?!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving happens to be my favorite holiday! But here is the problem with that... its once a year. I crave turkey and all the fixins alot more then once a year but there is no way in hell I am going to cook all of that. So that is where Boston Market comes into play. 
Boston Market has all the home cooked goodness of Thanksgiving but they serve individual meals so I can get that wonderful Thanksgiving comfort food experience at a fraction of the price. VICTORY! 
Their turkey and chicken are delicious but just like Thanksgiving day, what really stand out for me are the sides. I don't think I have had one thing at Boston Market that I didnt like. Among my favorites are the creamed spinich, mac and cheese, veggie stuffing, sweet potato casserole, and corn bread. 
Yes their prices are a bit higher then KFC but the quality and taste of their food is in on a whole other level. Also the service is always fast and friendly. 
If you love Thanksgiving and want to taste it, go to Boston Market today!"}
{"text":"Boston Market used to have really good side dishes to go with the chicken and turkey but lately the veggies have to undercooked and bland.  We used to go there at least twice a month but have not gone back for several months now.  It seems that when companies have a good thing, they start to cut corners."}
{"text":"Good food really quick and great service. Three piece chicken meal isn't cheap but it's good size.   The sides of sweet potatoes and crammed spinach were both really good and almost too hot.  Set potatoes had marshmallows mixed in.   Yum.   Portions are better than average. 

The crew was very friendly and for me in and out quickly.   Move lunch stop, next time I bring coupon."}
{"text":"I usually go to a different location but this Thanksgiving I made a 2nd stop at this one in search of pecan pie by the slice. They were MOBBED but a very pleasant and courteous employee (manager?) got the dessert for me and asked the cashier if she could ring me up since that was all I was getting, so I didn't have to wait in the long line. 

Sorry I didn't get your name, kind sir, but if you read this you know who you are. Thanks for your help on Thanksgiving Day!"}
{"text":"Update 11/25/16: Unfortunately they did away with their wonderful loaded mashed potatoes over a year ago. Also, their pumpkin pie used to be delicious and for the past couple of years it has had an odd flavor IMO. Other than those two disappointments I still enjoy their food and service, and once again got a very nice Thanksgiving take-out meal this year.

They were very busy--guess I'm not the only one who doesn't want to spend the holiday cooking!
...................................

I used to live in Tempe and would stop here often; don't live nearby now but occasionally still want a Boston Market meal, so I make the trek from the far east valley. There are two locations a little closer depending on the driving route, but I prefer the Elliott and McClintock restaurant as I have consistently received the best meals and service there. 

Stopped in this afternoon and picked up some good food to go--love the loaded mashed potatoes (the regular ones are good too), stuffing and some mac'n'cheese on the side, and for an entree will get the meat loaf, chicken or turkey. 

As usual the employees were very friendly, service was prompt and the meal was good. 

More than once I have driven in on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Eve Day to get everything required for a holiday meal, because holiday cooking ain't happening at this house. Their seasonal pumpkin pie was delicious this last holiday season; wish they carried it year round.

They do catering and delivery, though not sure if they deliver individual meals. I do know they deliver across the valley for the holidays--I've always driven in, but one year they told me they just got back from dropping an entire holiday meal off at someone's home (shoot, I could have delivered it for them and made a few bucks!). 

It takes a while to get there from San Tan Valley, but it's worth the drive. Hope one day they will open an equally-fine location out here."}
{"text":"Second time eating at this location. Mark, an older gentleman, was very pleasant both times. I only got the side sampler both times and they were very good. On the second time however, my husband came with us. He was the only one who ordered a sandwich. Hours later he came down with what appeared to be food poisoning as no one else in the family got sick. Let's just leave it at he was violently ill in multiple ways for many hours. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to for a quick last minute dinner when we have guests! The family meals are reasonably priced at $7ish a person which comes with meat, sides, and corn bread. We opted for the four person meal with the rotisserie chicken (so juicy!), mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, and bread. Definitely enough food for everyone and we even had leftovers! The drive thru aspect makes everything so simple and service is always great. You can sign up for their emails and get a coupon for your first visit!"}
{"text":"Try to order from here this evening and order prime rib à la cart and was told that I couldn't'. Was told that it was the one item out of every single item on the menu that is sold à la cart that they cannot sell À la Carte. Calling cooperate to confirm. Seems a bit strange that everything else can be sold that way except this one item."}
{"text":"Meh. I'm a fan of Boston Market but today was not the business. The chicken seemed undercooked, they didn't have the regular garlic spinach, the sweet potatoes were justo\"ok\". Instead of garlic spinach I ordered the creamed and it was gross. The cornbread was like a little crispy brick and basically inedible. I ended up changing the spinach for corn and it was either overcooked or old. Either way this meal was a waste of money.

The staff was nice but while I was trying to pay for my food the cashier started swooning all over my watch and handbag (both Michael Kors.) She then preceded to ask me how much it was and call over her coworker to look at it too! Flattered but weirded out."}
{"text":"I'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.

Boston Market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the Internet, the order is sent to the store that you select and you just go and pick it up.  Humph, that's where the happiness stops.  Just because you send your order in and are given a time for pick up does not mean that your order will be ready.  Also be sure to print out your \"invoice\" prior to going or they will literally argue with you that you order is complete.  Out of five orders, only two were done correctly.  So that meant the estimated twenty minutes on the \"invoice\" actually turned into about 45 minutes.  Would have been easier to drive here, walk into the store and wait for the order to be done.

And prices weren't really that great.  Food not as good either, the meatloaf I ordered has several pieces of gristle in it.  And if I hadn't asked for gravy to put on it, it would have been dry beyond believe.

As the stars say, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"I do love their rotisserie chicken the most.  I am not a huge fan of all of the sides.  I also do a lot of catering here for work lunches and they do a really great job at that.  Good option for fast, non fast food, just watch out for the sides..."}
{"text":"The staff was pleasant upon my entry. The Service was pretty good. The food I would barely feed my dead dog.  I only ordered two things the older gentleman behind the counter barely wanted to fill my plate with the two sides I requested. All i ordered were stramed vwggues and rrd skin potatoes. When i asked if the mashed potatoes were from scratch the gentleman said they were homemade. I stated: sir, those are not the same thing. I asked do you make then in house he said no. I told him that means this is processed he insisted they were homemade. I gave up on that convo.  Then, I got back to my office and saw why. The potatoes were burnt, the steamed veggies were half steamed and half I don't know what, not to mention dry. Additionally, they do not offer you a personal condiment stand so I had to double back for those. You know a little salt and pepper bc otherwise the struggle would have been too real."}
{"text":"Quarter chicken white with garlic new potatoes and mixed vegis. I get that meal at least once a week. Chicken is always cooked perfect with great flavor. Chocolate chip cookies are great too!  Staff at Alma/Ray are always friendly and give you a great smile at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Boston Market is usually a good go to place for decent tasting rotisserie style chicken and delicious sides. However, Boston Market kicks up the game higher with its chicken noodle soup. The soup is loaded with huge pieces of torn rotisserie chicken, wide, flat noodles, and small chunks of carrots, celery and onion. 

The stock is flavorful enough on its own, but I like to add in a couple of sprinkles of cayenne pepper, and man does this soup rock after this!  Try Boston Market's chicken noodle soup, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I hate fast food and yes Boston Market is fast food but if I need  quick fast meal I will hit this Boston Market up. 

This Boston Market is by far one of the best in local market.  Each and every time I get food here it's always fresh, great portions and this may sound funny but I always get what I order.  I say that because many of the other Boston Markets don't seem to know how to get it right.  I think the managers name is Remi, always friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  Unlike most the other Boston Markets in the area you wont get overcooked day old buffet food that is skimped on portions.   

Wish they would chill on there sodium content of there food but one can dream right?"}
{"text":"I love Boston Market and this one is the WORST of them all.  Portions are 2/3 of the bowls they use and the food is almost always over cooked.  I think they are related to the one near FLW and the 101, which is a great Bostons.  They always fill your bowls completely and you get your value for your money.  This one rips ya off and doesn't give you the full amount and the food tends to be overcooked and lacks any taste.  They always forgot my cornbread and how they fill there bowls for the sides it's almost a joke. I bet you anything they carry over food from previous days to sell as fresh because it tastes so bad and overdone.   The GM must be trying to fluff his pockets with not filling the bowls full and giving you 60-70% to lower his food costs. Also who is the moron who works there that parks there car so when you come off of 40th st and turn into the drive through you have to make a multiple point turn to avoid hitting that car.  .  They know what they are doing and it's just annoying. .  Avoid this one and if your near the one near 101 and FLW please visit it you will see such a huge difference."}
{"text":"The staff here is pretty great. I had never been to a Bostons Market before and Mary Kate and Nick were patient and helpful and answered all questions I had.  They even had to go find one of the answers and was willing to and didn't just make one up, which I thought was awesome.  We also had a little hiccup with one of our meals and Nick was quick to fix it without showing any type of attitude! 

I was recommended to try the sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. The sweet potatoes are candied and was my favorite thing we had. Mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy and good, but not as good as the potatoes. The ribs were better with the BBQ sauce they have in the dining area, but still just okay... the cod and cornbread were just mediocre too.
The staff though, never saw them just standing around, they were always cleaning and restocking and taking care of incoming guest."}
{"text":"I usually get the 3 piece dark combo which is delicious. But I have to say those chicken drumsticks and thighs come from the skinniest chickens on the face of the earth. A couple of nibbles on the thigh and you're basically down to the bone. 

I think Boston Market needs to feed those skinny chicken models a little bit more. For the $9.67 they charge for that meal, which includes a drink; I think Boston Market can do better and I'll just have to go elsewhere for my chicken fix until things improve."}
{"text":"I can't help it that I'm addicted to sweet potatoes. So that's why I have been gravitating toward Boston Market lately. My two sides are always sweet potatoes, or should I say my main course is the sweet potatoes and the chicken is my side. The food is excellent, although sometimes the chicken can get a little scrawny looking.

My only complaint about this place is that I'm constantly approached by employees to either sign up with my email address or being asked how's my meal. Last time I was in there I was asked how's my meal twice by the same guy and then a manager came by and asked the same thing. I get the touchy feely customer service thing. But PLEASE, dial it down a bit."}
{"text":"From the disgusting, discolored meat, to the old crusty lookin sides, this place could not be more disgusting! The manager Tracy clearly hates both her life and her job. When I was in there, no less than 3 people actually turned around and walked out because of the condition of the food in there.  This did not go unnoticed by a charming employee behind the counter who yelled \"hey fuc* off\" as they left. Apparently making edible food and having good customer service is too much of an interruption to the smoke breaks that they were all discussing when I walked in. Never go here!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. I went with a group from work, who at times can be very difficult to accommodate. The entire crew made sure we had the most convenient and delicious lunch. A huge thank you to them."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work to pick up dinner on April 10th around 615pm. Worst service ever. Tonyea was completely rude the entire time and was talking shit to her coworkers while I was standing at the register. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The littlest pieces of chicken I ever had!
 They try compensating by adding a bunch of veggies. Disappointing for $7.57 would not return. I will say Evan was great working the front counter and working the tables."}
{"text":"Last night at this location, we walk in any my sister sees the same two people serving and then handling money without gloves the whole. This violates food handling laws, and is in-efficient. My sister could not eat there after seeing that.

Normally I like Boston, but lately the veggies are overdone, and then this incident. It might be a while before i cautiously return."}
{"text":"Ordered a family meal for Christmas Eve and things were missing from our order! There were a total of 3 people helping us with our order and things were left out. It's obviously too late to go back or call and let them know. Never again, not happy with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went at 6:30 and out of chicken that was literally five people at the restaurant I could wait 10 minutes for a chicken or get people just seems weird but please note for chicken is that a chicken at dinner time"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty clean and fast. They are frequently out of some of their menu selections however. Location is convenient. They only serve one size soda which is like 20 oz and its priced at 1.99. You may just want to bring your own.:( 
Service is so-so to good based on the dozens of times I've stopped in."}
{"text":"Unacceptably slow service. First sight, there were 4 tables with dishes and one with a bus tub on top of the table. We were 3rd group in line, chicken cutter guy asked what we wanted. We replied with our order. The plates of food then sat on top of the stainless steel counter for the next 7 minutes until we could get our sides. Chicken cold, sides hot. My wife wouldn't go to the US location because it is scary. Sorry this was scary x2."}
{"text":"Miranda is the definition of quality customer service. She offered fresh , hot food, all the proper materials to eat the damn food. Since lately I've had to ask for napkins and straws . I'm not a huge complainer but damn after supporting these fast food chains for years they should give the bare minimum to customers. This employee should be brought into a management position to train regionally and BOSTON MARKET YOU WILL GET Your MONEY's WORTH. And of course Miranda follows up with the promotion to leave a survey and tells us about the 15% off on our next visit to BOSTON MARKET! I love me some Boston Market  COME BACK TO CALI!!"}
{"text":"Great service Here! Brenda is the best. Wish I could say more but service and food is great."}
{"text":"I like this place because compared to claim jumper, prices are more reasonable for a meatloaf dinner and quicker. and if you get on their email list, you'll get special offers. Great comfort food choices and friendly service.   But I wish they had a drive thru at this location since sometimes I have my kids with me and this is not my first choice if I have them with me."}
{"text":"Boo hiss your TV dinners are less salty than your food fresh from this restaurant. Used to love Boston Chicken but it's declined too much."}
{"text":"I called them the day before thanksgiving to see if I had to preorder my order and they said they don't do online or take orders by phone. The guy said it was first come first serve so I said okay I'll just go in today and order food. When I got there when they open at 9 the lady at the counter told me what I wanted was sold out. That's what we wanted for thanksgiving and for them to lie to me was bull crap. My company from work orders from them once a month for cater and I'm the manager for my company. We will no longer order from them even for our company."}
{"text":"I meant to do this awhile ago. Boston Market reached out to me to make this right. They were very thorough and followed up with me once they spoke with and coached their employees. I am satisfied with the outcome and will return to this business."}
{"text":"Boston market used to taste homemade. This place has gone extremely downhill. First of all the food looks really really basic, like it came out of a can and has been sitting under heat lamp all night. Secondly it tastes very bland.

Besides the food, the service is horrible! I'm at the place right now, I can count 10 people working, yet the drive through is closed and I stood next in line for 15 minutes. 

This places used to be the shit, not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Fast service but not really a \"fast food\" joint anymore. 
During the mid 90s I worked at a location where the only two practical choices for lunch were Einstein Bagel and Boston Market, luckily neither were too bad.
I stopped going to BM over the years because the quality went down and the sides became completely tasteless. Fast forward to 2012, I'm in the mood for roasted chicken, I'm pressed for time and there it is. I cut across 3 lanes on Independence bvd but I made it.  Nine bucks for half a chicken?? There are plenty of restaurants and sports bars that charge the same or less at lunch time!! mm Thai chili garlic sauce, the potatoes look and the garlic spinach looks good I'll bite, 
What a china plate, real silverware and they bring it to your table?  There a sign on the table that says \" no tips, and leave the cleaning to us\" they stole my idea of tip-free restaurant dining!!

 I hate the experience of eating in fast food joints so to me this seems like a great idea. The price no longer seemed excessive The food was ..... passable as in not too bad. They need to get a beer license"}
{"text":"Good Comfort Food

I don't frequent Boston Market often but when I do the food is always good. Your greeted the moment you walk in the door.  

 The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and even came to check on us during our meal - like we were eating at a full-service restaurant.

The chicken and meatloaf were flavorful and the mashed potatoes reminded me of the kind we make at home.

Usually a good inexpensive choice when you're hungry."}

{"text":"I'm never ashamed of the half chicken deal here! It's fall apart delicious and with two mediocre sides and a slice of cornbread I'm good. I think my total was like 9$. I feel good about the convenience, quickness, and friendly service."}

{"text":"I don't care what anybody says, Boston Market it good homecooked style food. The prices are a half step above cheap but, I'm always down for good food. 

I got the chicken salad sanwhich with a side of mac and cheese. And of course a large cup of minute maid. All very good. Ill be back. Heard they got good chicken....."}
{"text":"Really disappointed today.  Got take out for 2 chic dinners both with roasted red tators and cream spinach. 
First off, it was about 4 pm and several trays of side dishes were empty or very close to it. The ones that did have food, had the dried out look on the top like it had been sitting for a while.  I asked for fresh red potatoes as the ones in the try look dried out.  She brought out fresh ones from the back but those too were over cooked and dried out.  The cream spinach was real thick, almost too much.  The chicken was good, but the sides were not."}
{"text":"My friend and I used to come here all the time. We decided the other day it sounded good so we went back. Now, I'm not saying it was terrible but, it definitely didn't taste like it used to. The stuffing is not that good at all, I had to cover it in pepper. The mashed potatoes were ok and the chicken was alright. Mac and cheese was probably the best part and it didn't seem to taste as good as it used to. I don't know if they've changed recipes or brands but it seemed different.

I'm not saying I won't go back because it wasn't that bad. Just hoping it was an off day!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Boston Market for years, but really loved my lunch today!  I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo, which was the perfect amount, and it only cost $6.99!  I LOVED the chicken noodle soup.  I also decided to try their new bacon Brussels sprouts side dish and it was pretty good!  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  Boston Market is a nice healthier option when you need something quick and don't want to go to a fast food drive thru!"}
{"text":"As far as Boston Markets go, this one isn't bad. It, along with most of the restaurants I've seen lately, has been nicely renovated. They also seem to have upped their customer service, in that after you place your order, they actually escort you to your table and bring you your food. Even though there are no dedicated waiters, the employees still do their best to come around and make sure you're doing well.

The food itself is delicious! The chicken is always juicy, and the sides are always plentiful and tasty as well. Personally, I flip flop between the creamed spinach, the mac and cheese, and sometimes the sweet potatoes if I'm feeling like a complete pig. 

The only drawback to this particular location for me is that there's no drive through. I know, I know...first world problems.  Other than that, you'll be sure to find great service, engaged employees, and most of all, great food!"}
{"text":"I remember coming here quite often when I lived near. The food is always great every time. I especially like the buy one get one free Saturday promotion. It was always a given that Saturday's were Boston Market days. The staff is very nice and you have a way of developing great customer to staff relationships with the group there. They are all so nice. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best rotisserie chicken I've had in a while. Definitly worth checking out. Friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"We frequent this Boston market due to convenience and the meal preparation is normally good. 

Today was a disappointment. We ordered a market bowl with mashed potatoes corn extra gravy and white chicken meat and a quarter rib dinner.

The rib dinner was absolutely unacceptable. It consisted of two small sized bones and a third bone which had practically no meat on it photo attached. The sides were decent in quality and quantity. 

The market bowl was lacking in mashed potatoes as it had way too much gravy for the amount of mashed potatoes included.  One would think there would be an adequate amount of mashed potatoes for the gravy. 

Service was quick, the store was clean, and the display counter was clean and appealing. However the quality of today's meal was subpar. Come on Boston Market you can do better."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great Food. Always fresh.  Always Polite. I'm a Regular Customer!"}
{"text":"The food isnt hot. How can they prevent bacteria from growing. T he inside smelled terrible"}
{"text":"I work long hours so i decided to order our family Thanksgiving  from Boston Market. What a  joke! They said to allow 2 hours to heat the turkey and ham, that's fine!  But then you have all the additional sides at 10 mins each. Well by the time we did all that we could have prepared our own meal. We ordered an extra addotional side of mac n cheese and opened it up to find there was only a half container of it! That side wss an additional 11.59! What a joke! The food was such a total disappointment. Ive tasted hospital food better than this! 158.00 later and a bit pissed!"}
{"text":"Boston Market is always fast with good food. Let's face it, it's not fine dining but it hits the spot. The place could use some sprucing up, especially the bathroom. I was disappointed today when most days I leave with my hunger satisfied. The new potatoes tend to be undercooked most times and I had dark meat in my sandwich; bleh! To top it off, the bread was was crusty enough that it cut my lip and bled; what he heck! By no means a #1 pick, but it will do trick when you're tied of burger fast food and sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"I visited this Boston Market yesterday and was displeased with my meal.I ordered the baked chicken tenders.I don't even know where to begin to describe the tenders but let me advise you to not order them.There is so much breading on it and no meat whatsoever.The amount of meat available under the breading was paper thin (no exaggeration).I thought maybe just one of my tenders were like that but all of them were.I suggest Boston Market take it off the menu.

The customer service was good!"}
{"text":"really good mac and cheese, options for those who are vegatarian, quick service as well as nice servers. food is warm and you can see it being prepared."}
{"text":"Boston Market never gets old. The food is great & the employees really try to make your experience wonderful. This is a great place any day."}
{"text":"Pulled up to order box and tried to place an order, but some recording plays that sounds like someone talking to you but they cannot hear me. Then a real human speaks and they cannot be heard or understood on the order taker box. They cannot apparently hear me either. I order 2 platters and they keep asking \"what sides?\" I already said potatoes/gravy & dressing twice. I requested bread (NOT cornbread) explaining every time I had asked in the past, I still get cornbread! This time I get NO bread at all! For an overpriced $9 platter, they really fall short of offering value. Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Tasty Food, Nice Service, Happy Eating!

The service was great from there girls tonight. Everyone was friendly and nice. 

The food as always was nice and tasty... I am a fan of the meatloaf... Sweet potato goodness!

Stop by for a happy feeding to satisfy your inner animal!"}
{"text":"I attempted to order online for pick-up and was unable to submit my order. I called in and the manager was able to help me immediately. He was quick and friendly. By the time I had arrived, they had all of my food freshly cooked and ready to go. The staff was beyond awesome, and the customer service was exceptional. I will definitely be returning to this specific location! Thank you to the Boston Market manager and staff for going out of your way to provide great customer service, it did not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Incompetent, disorganized, overstaffed and not properly trained! I counted nine (yes 9!!) employees working the front counter and they could not get my  caesar salad order complete which is premade and only needed to add chicken. There were only 3 people ahead of me but they were all waiting for something and all of the employees were standing around waiting for someone else to do whatever the other persons job was ....so stupid! Even when it's super busy 3-4 people can serve the food. How many people work in the back!   The girl who everyone was waiting to slice chicken was just standing there with a knife caressing the chicken but never cut it.  After 20 minutes I left. WHERE'S THE MANAGER."}
{"text":"On 2 separate trips to this particular location, they ran out of white meat chicken! That is totally unacceptable! Also, when they DO have chicken, it always seems to be just lukewarm instead of piping hot, I wish Phoenix had KOO KOO ROO Chicken like they do in LA....They are way better than Boston Market."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I'll never go here again I go here at 9:58pm the rude lady locks the door in my face and says sorry were closed!!! What a joke"}
{"text":"I don't care if it's \"gourmet poor people food.\" I love it! Was convinced to do the BOGO chicken and rib meal special split between three people. Not a bad deal. Mashed potatoes and corn were my favorite. BBQ sauces and ribs are pretty boring. Chicken is the best."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed :( I was really looking forward to this and I can't even describe how terrible it tasted.  To the point I can't believe it and feel I need to give it another try, but also want to never see the name again.  I only took a few bites before completing saying nope and throwing it out.  The corn bread was pretty delicious though, unfortunately that's it.  I ordered the half chicken with lemon/ garlic herb.  The sauce was SO overwhelming and the chicken itself tasted horrible - I cant describe it.  For sides, I ordered the stuffing and sweet potato casserole.  Everything tasted so overly processed and just terrible.  Sorry to anyone that enjoys it!  I was really looking forward to it but felt I needed to share."}
{"text":"Only had there meatloaf meal for 4 with mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, and corn so Im not sure about other items. But what Ive had so far from them is good. I love there meatloaf. The mac and cheese is one of the best and the mashed potatoes and gravy is amazing. The corn is good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely impressed with the service!!!  Cheerful staff, friendly, and tasty food priced fairly.  A superstar employee (so sorry I didn't get her name) took our order and provided us with the best service I've had in a long time!  She does her job well and makes this place worth coming to just for the service!  Great job with your hiring skills Boston Market!"}
{"text":"Not once, but twice, have I left this restaurant only to end up violently ill for 2 days following. If it happens once, ok, maybe it's a one-off, a fluke. But for it to happen twice? Nope. I'm done. Both times, my partner and I went, got identical sides, but I got chicken, she got meatloaf. She never got sick, so I'm guessing the meatloaf is safe. 

But both times I had chicken, which looked like it was cooked through, I ended up in the bathroom for 2 days straight with the worst case of food poisoning. Like I said, if it had only happened once, that's one thing. But to have an identical reaction twice in a row says that something isn't right.

I'm wondering how sanitary the rotisseries are that hold the chicken. I mean, they put raw chicken on, cook it, take it off, throw another raw chicken on the same skewer. I don't see a lot of safe food handling being done. 

Needless to say, I'm not going back. Ever. In fact the thought of eating rotisserie chicken makes my stomach turn. Thanks Boston Market."}
{"text":"Every time this location gets a little busy they seem to run out of chicken. Boston Market on 59th and Peoria seems to understand supply and demand a little bit better."}
{"text":"Well I must say that Boston market has gone through a lot of changes over the years and this one near my apt. is no exception. The drive-thru concept is unusual for this kind of establishment....but it is efficient. The staff is very friendly....and the place is very clean as well. They always have specials and deals for the entire family....rather it is just for two....or an entire group. I guess though it has lost some of it's appeal from the older Boston Markets I am used to.....and that is why I gave only 3 stars. However it is a good place to eat....and the prices are not to bad. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. 445 at dinner time and no potatoes. Plus missing numerous missing items. Not even prepared for a dinner rush. It's not even busy and out of things. Smh"}
{"text":"Good food as usual at all locations...However, THIS location went above and beyond for us simply because I had to wait a few minutes for turkey!! PROACTIVELY turned a possible negative in to a hyper positive. GOOD JOB."}
{"text":"Everything's fine here... they do seem to run out of chicken at times so like dark meat they were out of on a few occasions. otherwise I go back often, drive-through is fast and accurate."}
{"text":"So I have been there TWICE in the past week now im hooked! lol fresh clean ! Tasty! I love there Coke cups maket he soda taste just better! Service is great Chefs are friendly New fav place! lol = ] Enjoy guys!"}
{"text":"I came here to get a quick pick for my lunch. I walked in and I was on my phone so to be courteous I stepped off to the side until I was done (It was work related hence on my lunch break). Then a gentleman started talking to me telling me he would just watch me on my phone when I clearly said I wasn't ready and why I stepped off to the side. I walk up to him and order what he suggests. Simple pot roast with 2 sides, but apparently this order is more complicated than that. Anyhow i go to pay the cashier because he had to go to a different area for my food. He comes up and what appears to be the manager is standing by him says to him, \"why did you do that\" while looking at my plate. He says, \"I explained it to her very slowly\". I just looked up and could not believe what he said, but I said nothing. I just know I won't be back. The cashier I think realized that I was upset because she offered other things which I ignored and to just give me my food. I was very irritated when I left because of that comment.

The only positive is the food is good not a great presentation for the price but it was good. That's why they get 3 stars or else it would have been 0 if I could."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good place to stop while on our way to Concord, NC. My wife and I didn't want to stop at a burger and fries joint, so I specifically sought out a Boston Market. Good food, and just as quick as a fast food place. 
I've been liking Boston Market chicken for years, and this is what I'll stay with. I'm not a fan of the ribs. They're 'ok,' and that's all I can give them. They arrive frozen, then are heated in store. Nothing special there. As for the sides; I had the zucchini casserole, and green beans. My wife had macaroni & cheese, and creamed spinach. She didn't like the creamed spinach, lol. I liked the casserole, but there was a bit of sweetness to it. Why does everything have to be sweet these days? Besides those minor issues, overall it was better than the typical fast food fare."}
{"text":"Let's be real. Its Boston Market. They aren't reinventing the wheel.  But the food came out hot and fresh tasting. And the service was super friendly.  Theresa anticipated my needs and the line worked fast.  If anything, I'd come back here for the service and its clean. Those two things alone make it 4 stars when compared to other fast casuals."}
{"text":"Shame on Boston Market. Bait and Switch! Avoid!

Did you see that new ad for the new prime rib for the great price?? It brought me in. The ad said Wednesday Friday and Sunday starting at 5:00. I guess I didn't notice the fine print at the bottom of the ad that said \"while supplies last\". I came in at 6:00 to try it. Guess what? They were out. Had been for a while. THEY DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO EVEN LAST AN HOUR. This is nothing but a bait and switch to bring people in with a deal that is \"too good to be true\". (Of course,  they'll gladly sell you the same tired menu that did NOT bring me into the store in the first place.) Guess what? The new prime rib dinner is too good to be true!! Avoid this store!

Shame on Boston Market!!!"}
{"text":"Disorganized place, nobody behind counter seems to care. This chain has gone down hill."}
{"text":"The half chicken here is huge! They give you a lot of food and it always tastes fresh. The chicken is good but I wish it wasn't too dry. Other than that it tastes good and I really like the amount of food they give you!"}
{"text":"Pretty good location. Staff are pretty nice. Very clean and well kept. And food is still on point ;)"}
{"text":"I love Boston Market but this location was a mess. The soda machine rug was sopping wet. Place was almost empty but we could hardly sit anywhere because a lot of tables looked very unclean & still had dishes on them. My sides were barely warm and got cold quick. Most of the drinks tasted stale."}
{"text":"Online ordering and promo codes found on Retail Me Not . com makes this a no brainer! Boston Market is pretty standard American fare but it is good and if you stick to the traditional sides you will enjoy your meal. Because I order online this is always a quick and pleasant experience for me plus this location is extremely close to home so I am  regular here but I don't always check in on Yelp, LOL to show it."}
{"text":"Nobody answered phone when we tried to place an order for pickup.  Slow service.  Unfriendly service.  Location dirty.  Thankfully I am plant based but even coming to pickup food for relatives is unpleasant."}
{"text":"I arrived at this Boston market at 9:20pm and they were no where in sight. Yet they are suppose to close at 9:30pm. The lights were all off and they were closed at 9:20. I will never go again. I was so disappointed, I was craving their greens. Now they will never have my business."}
{"text":"A case here a couple months ago irritated over a small issue but they redeemed themselves today! I"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The food was good. But I can't say great, and strangely I can't seem to put my finger on quite why. Something about the chicken seemed processed rather than wholesome. The sides were good too, but again not great. Overall, I'd probably come back when looking for a rotisserie chicken meal with sides but I'd also be open to considering options."}
{"text":"Great convenient location next to my work. Good food when u want fast but don't want to hate yourself with fast food. Friendly staff,clean and quiet. Noting special but always tasty and predictable."}
{"text":"Clean, awesome food for any taste. I ordered a salad bowl Mediterranean, Sweet Tomatoes closed next door and this was my next choice. It also offers free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Great experience. The manager was a real sweetheart very refreshing. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here ever! Now I know what I have been missing. Been here twice in one week. Full chicken, mash potatoes and gravy, green beans, and that dip! Omg be back tomorrow(;"}
{"text":"I wish we'd eat here more often. I love it! I always enjoy the environment. It's bright, clean & smells great! When you dine in, you get real plates and silverware. The food is always delicious. It's about $10 a plate but that's pretty much what you pay many places. You'll always enjoy your meal here."}
{"text":"What can I say about Boston Market? We love all their sides and the chicken is juicy, tender and flavorful. When purchasing more than a family dinner to go though, they really prefer you call ahead with your order. We didn't do this a few times and let's just say we were met with frowns. 

Overall, the food is great and service is good."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken, pork, mac and cheese, loaded and plain mashed potatoes, turkey, green beans, and two beverages. The food looked fresh and tasted good. The tables and seats were clean. When I was sitting at my table, an employee came over to ask me if I needed anything. I had no problems. The price can be a little high, but they do have coupons that can reduce the price by a lot if you use them."}
{"text":"Nice location. Food is good. I like getting the side meal when I can;t think of where to eat. My baby loves the mac and cheese here. Staff is nice. Store is clean."}
{"text":"Years ago I definitely would have given this Boston Market a five stars.  I now give this Boston Market four stars because of the corporate policy.  Boston Market serves their meals on real glass plates and real silverware.  Once customers are finished with their meals they leave everything on the tables.  During busy times when the dining room often looks messy as tables are often cluttered with napkins and dished which often have uneaten food on it.  I like the old method alot better.  Plastic plates and customers throw their own trash away."}
{"text":"I've been to this Boston Market at least three times now, once a coupla years ago on my last trip to Az when my daughter and I were looking for a fast place to grab a bite before a movie at the Tempe Cinema Theater and then I rediscovered it by Yelping the neighborhood for the same purpose a couple of weeks ago.  That time I grabbed a quick Rotisserie Chicken Plate, dark meat (my favorite), with sides of Rotisserie Chicken Noodle Soup (unlimited refills but I didn't have time to partake of that), cornbread, broccoli (gotta get my veggies in when possible), and sweet potatoes casserole.  Other than being a little salty, which concerns me for health reasons, and the casserole being pretty sweet, everything was delicious and I wished I hadn't had to rush thru it but didn't want to eat popcorn on an empty stomach.  It made mighty fine leftovers the next day, too.

I attempted to go back a week later to try the Turkey Plate but discovered after I parked that I had worn the wrong shorts with my money and cards in the other pair back at the motel.  By the time I drove back there it was too late for the movie so I just ate near my motel and called it a night.  

Last night I made sure I was properly financed and headed over to this Boston Market again.  As soon as I walked in I was  enveloped in wonderful aromas that made my mouth water.  I ordered the Turkey Plate with cornbread, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for about $8 including tax.  Now, I'm a dark meat fan, but that turkey breast was so moist and tender and flavorful I was an instant fan.  I could cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The only problem was for whatever reason, it wasn't hot, just sort of tepid, even borderline cool in spots.  Because I was hungry and headed for another movie across the street I didn't say anything because it tasted so good.  The spinach and mashed potatoes were hot, just not the meat.  

Later in the meal a worker walked by and asked how everything was so I politely let her know the everything was delicious accept the meat wasn't hot when served to me.  A man who may have been a manager overheard me and insisted on bringing me a fresh serving of turkey even tho I told him it wasn't necessary.  I ate most of it there because it was even better warm, and added the rest to my leftovers for lunch today.  Needless to say I was highly impressed with this level of customer service.

The only other issue I had was when I first sat down I found the chair to be quite loose and wiggly so I switched to the chair next to it.  When the same man mentioned earlier walked by I mentioned to him about the chair.  He tested it, agreed it was not acceptable, and immediately removed it from service, thanking me for letting him know.  Again, I was impressed by how quickly a customer's concerns we're responded to.

I'm actually looking forward to returning here to have some of their Beef Brisket and maybe more turkey and soup."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a chain.  But it was there for us when we needed it.  My mother wasn't eating well on her own and my middle daughter lived in Mesa, not too far, so she would stop by Boston Market and pick up a couple of dinners on the way to visit her and they would have a nice visit and meal together.  Since Mother always liked what my daughter brought and ate well, at least we knew she was getting good nutrition from it and some leftovers for the next day.  

When I was in town I would stop by there too  I always liked their sides and would sometimes just get a vegetarian plate of just the sides.  I liked their roast sirloin or whatever they call it too, for the price.  And their desserts were pretty good.  I liked that they had dishes that you don't find in most fast food places.  I never had a problem with anything I ate from there and they were pretty consistent in their quality so I give it four stars on a sliding scale compared to other fast food establishments.  I'd go back anytime I'm in the mood for good old American comfort food."}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese were below average and flavorless and the green beans and stuffing were terrible.  Rotisserie chicken was average, no flavor and a bit dry. Disappointed at how bad the food was."}
{"text":"Tasted like chicken, which is what I ordered so they have that going for them. Pretty decent food, nice staff at this location, quick and easy for lunch!"}
{"text":"The food was plentiful and very good, better than expected in fact.  Most of the staff was very pleasant, and the restaurant was clean.

HOWEVER

The restroom was absolutely disgusting, and it appeared as though the toilet/urinal hadn't received the appropriate attention in quite some time.  

In addition, there was one white male staff member who appeared to be the manager that was exceedingly loud and obnoxious in what would have otherwise been a pleasant and relaxing environment.     He worked all around the restaurant during my time there, seemingly filling in as needed.  He talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen.  He kept his food prep gloves on while delivering food to tables, and after scratching his head, and touching countless other restaurant surfaces before returning to the kitchen and continuing to use the same gloves.

What could have been a very positive experience was absolutely ruined by this man."}
{"text":"It's funny how Boston Market takes me back to my childhood when rotisserie restaurants were becoming popular. this euphoric I think of the Very rare when I go to something about going here although they have added new things to menu this place has some type of nostalgia. It's very rare that I go here to eat but when I saw that they had a Prime Rib special (I love prime rib) decided I would grab a quick dinner. 
The prime rib dinner is only on Sundays and Wednesday after 5pm. The dinner is 14.99 and comes with 2 sides and cornbread. The prime rib was a decent size and wasn't to thin. I had the green beans that were steamed and crisp and a lil bland but would get again since they weren't over cooked. The mashed potatoes with gravy were not bad either. I tasted the sweet potato casserole which was also tasty. 
The rotisserie chicken was seasoned very well and better than the one that you get from the local grocery store. 
I joined the Boston Market VIP club so I also got 3 dollars off my meal. Not bad at all. The staff was also very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Boston Market has always been a bit of an enigma to me.  It takes classic American comfort food and makes it fast food friendly.  Well, actually, it makes it more like cafeteria food that you are able to take home with you.  It was interesting to hear how popular they were this past Thanksgiving, with record sales.  They feature classic American proteins like turkey, meat loaf and rotisserie chicken.  They all are flavorful, but always have a bit of an artificial taste to me.  They feature multiple sides, vegetables, mashed potatoes and stuffing.  They feature their sweet potato casserole, but it is a bit of a mess.  To me the most unique side item is their corn bread, which comes in an individual sized loaf.  All this being said, this location always seems busy.  Parking is extremely challenging with the small lot right off the busy street entrance.  The employees are nice and helpful.  Overall, if you are desperate to get some fast food, and want something more than the usual, worth a trip."}
{"text":"Get the honey habanero sauce with your chicken. Free, good mix of spicy and sweet and probably the best sauce for chicken ever."}
{"text":"Top notch, caring staff. For what they serve, at all hours of the day, never a let down. I eat here whenever I need a cooking break now."}
{"text":"So I usually don't review chains such as this but just in case you are in the area and either have never been or don't have one by you I wanted to let you know what they are all about.  No frills no outstanding culinary surprises here just good food that's doesn't taste processed. They have a good selection of items from rotisserie chicken meatloaf and ribs and don't forget some sandwiches.   I like the fact I can get fresh cooked vegetables no canned green beans here and fresh seasonal selection as well as corn, mashed potatoes roasted red skins and other sides. My wife prefers the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as well as the apples in cinnamon sauce. The apples admittedly are not freshly prepared with a homemade sauce and are probably out of a can but they do hit the spot if you want something sweet with dinner. The restaurant  is very very clean as well as the bathrooms the staff have always been super friendly and the food is quick. If you don't want fast food and want a good down home meal don't hesitate to go.  Oh and by the way If you like your food cooked in hot oil this  is not the place for you I don't believe there is a fryer on premises."}
{"text":"I work just up the street and we always eat here for lunch, every time i go in they are always super nice and friendly, the food is fresh and I'm always in and out. Most of the time I'm picking up food for the whole office so one of the employees told me that i can call and order over the phone to make it easier on me which was great! I love going here, i always get GREAT service :)!"}
{"text":"I use to go to Boston Market a lot when I had one close to my work in Tempe.  I passed by this one on my way to my workout, decided to grab a quick bit.  I got a 1/4 white chicken, with rotisserie potatoes, and sweet corn plus cornbread.  The place is clean, the staff is super nice, but the chicken & cornbread was dry and the potatoes and corn were OK."}
{"text":"Standard comfort food if you don't feel like standing in front of a stove waiting for your chicken to roast. Or grunting your way through sweat and arm strength trying to mash some potatoes. Sometimes I get really lazy, and that's where Boston Market comes in. 

The service was actually very nice and we ate in. It's never really busy at night in the dining area as people mostly pick up their dinners and go. So it makes for a nice unwinding spot, hopefully with a friend or just by yourself. The chicken is not as tasty as Costco's but you can expect decent, standard dinner fare here. I highly recommend the pecan pie and giant chocolate brownie."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for mashed potatoes and rotisserie chicken. I yelped 'Boston Market' and was SO glad this location was right by my house. We just moved into this area a few months ago so we're still in the process of discovering what's all around us. Staff at this location are super courteous and the food was the awesome original home cooked food that Boston Market is known for. I couldn't be more happy that this gem is less than 2miles from our home."}
{"text":"Do you like home cooking but quick? Well this is the place for you. I enjoy eating here because they offer the side sampler meal. I get three sides with corn bread. This meal option is the perfect portion for me. You can also get chicken, meatloaf, or soup meals with sides too. If you eat in, your meal comes out on a real plate, not paper or plastic. The staff even brings it to your table. I love mashed potatoes and gravy. I highly recommend their mashed potatoes with gravy. It is so delicious. 

Boston Market caters, you can also get large portions to go. Plus you can even get your meal to go. Many times on Saturday's they have a buy one meal get one for free."}
{"text":"Boston Market... yum.  If you're in the mood for some home-style foods or in a hurry and want some comfort food, this is the place to go!  I especially like this location because they have the same menu with healthy options AND they'll make you up a fresh batch of something if they're running low or it's late and they ran out.  My roomie and I sometimes stopped here after our Lifetime Fitness nights. :)

See ya there!"}
{"text":"There is something about their rotisserie chicken that makes this such a comfort meal. I had the half-chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy, corn, and added mac & cheese. That corn bread they give you is so good it could be dessert...LOL  If I had a \"complaint\" they seemed to be a bit skimpy on the sides that come with the meal but overall the food is delicious and satisfying. The place here is very well kept and clean and the service provided was great."}
{"text":"I prefer supporting our small business people , but sometimes convenience overrides desire.

The Food here is not bad , portion size and price all seem ok , but the woman that served us was not very friendly.  No Thank you ,,,or have a nice day ,,,, just a grunt ? 

She did not close the plastic lid on my meal and the gravy spilled inside the bag , leaking on the car seat. 

She also forgot to include my cornbread. This place would do well to hire people who enjoy working with the public."}
{"text":"Great home style cooking 
Tori was great at serving
Left full of good food - I love eating at this place! No time to cook then eat the chicken! Cornbread is sweet - cookies for dessert"}
{"text":"Whats better than over priced chicken of all things....I guess because, they give you that great service and drop it off at the table never to be seen again.  I do not get it..has anyone ever counted the dirty plates on the tables?Or the bathroom so nasty that you barf from urine smell.? Now they say they have BBQ? Come on BBQ? where is the smoker? In the back of a food truck?that rolled in the pre cooked ribs?
               I just do not get it.. What is Boston about it? And what is Market about it?"}
{"text":"No no.. Boston Market ? HUH    go back to Boston with your nasty food and prices give me a break 1 piece of chicken 2 spoons  of veg 10 bucks?When I saw 3 Cops eating for free?I know it happens all the time I guess its the \" if we give them free food we will get more protection?\" with plate fulls of Food and by the way they did not need it . I will pay anything but when the food is nasty .. I swear I was praying to the toilet God all night after eating here.. Never again   .Its a great idea.. If the food was not so terrible . 

PS   there maybe locations that actually have food that you can eat but,, the few Charlotte NC location are terrible  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"I love Boston Market. I do not know how to cook and so the food there is always better than mine. The best part is if you buy a meal during the week they give you a coupon for one half off on Saturday.  Great value and it heats up well."}
{"text":"Never before but last night went there and the dining area was filthy, bathroom too..was told we had to wait 15 mins for the chicken to be ready...spoke to manager and she told us her problems, she seemed overwhelmed..I loved that place..I hope things change"}
{"text":"When i need quick home cooking, this is my go-to. Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely nothing spectacular or notable about this place. It's on par with fast food and sometimes that's all I have time for. On the particular night I was most recently there, they had no turkey left and it was going to be a long wait. So that bummed me out because it was right at the beginning of the dinner hour and they didn't seem prepared. Additionally, one of the servers abruptly walked away as we were ordering and did not return though a large line was building behind us. We had to ask another server behind the counter what happened and she just proceeded to take our order."}
{"text":"The times I've eaten here, the food was so-so. Meh."}
{"text":"This Boston Market was terrible.  My chicken was very dry and I was not able to eat it.  It was replaced, but still was not the quality I am used to.  It was after 2:00, but I didn't expect the poor quality of the food.  I also took home a pot pie for my husband who always loves them, but it was very, very dry inside.   He could not even eat it  as the chicken inside was also dry.   This all occurred on November 8th at the Matthews location.   I usually go to the University area Boston Market which is always good."}
{"text":"Fast and Fresh! 

I always get the quarter white chicken, with two sides of mashed potatoes and man n cheese. Can't go wrong for $7! 

I went during dinner rush, so the line was a little long but the staff was friendly. 

Not my favorite location though, there's always a lot of traffic. So pull in through the back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the new portion sizes. I stop here on my lunch break a least twice a month and always have a good experience, until now. I was OK with the $0.50 increase for my two favorite sides, Creamed Spinach & Sweet Potato Casserole, but now they've gone and made the meat portions smaller. The half chicken is about half the size as what I'm used to for the same price. This particular visit was sub-par even without the above issues. The staff was horsing around and laughing extremely loud when no customers were at the counter. My sides were way less than hot. In fact, I had to take the creamed spinach back to get a hotter portion, which they microwaved so it was dry on top and lava in the middle. . . Careful what you ask for. The only reason why I didn't leave only one star is due to the great taste of everything. Not sure if I'll be back on not. Visited 4/19/18 around 1:30 p.m."}
{"text":"3 stars for semi decent kids meal. I couldn't order anything for myself bc the calories were astronomical. I tried my daughter's veggies,  wayyy too much pepper, neither of us are it. Mac n cheese could've been bigger.  

Really don't see us returning but here's an adorable picture anyways."}
{"text":"I remember my parents taking me to boston market when I was a kid in California. There's just something about their comfort food that sits right in my belly. Always a good experience at this location in Tempe. Foods good. Always satisfied."}
{"text":"After a long day at a funeral on February 26th, 2016, the family was tired, worn out, and just plain ol' hungry. We struggled with finding anything nearby as I'm not from that area. I suggested Boston Market and my wife, who grew up in Aurora, agreed. Back home where I'm from, there's a Boston Market near my house who's staff has always been very friendly and outgoing. I was hoping for a similar experience here.

Upon entering, I wasn't sure what to get and was just in need of some good ol' chicken. We were smacked upside the head with a lot of happy, smiling faces which put us at ease. This location's staff is very personable and lively. We got a couple plates to go and they did their best to give us the best cuts of meat they could. Even while watching, the meat carver in the back called out to the guests waiting behind us to get them started in an energetic, engaging fashion. Customer service like this is an art, and they should keep it going let alone celebrate it.

We got the food home and there wasn't a single complaint - just the sounds of *nom*nom*nom*. It was hot, delicious, and really satisfying, which was a great end to a sad day for us.

Thanks to the staff of Boston Market in Solon, OH. You made our day so much better by just being awesome.

Sincerely,

The couple in formal wear with the child in the white polka dot dress."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times while shopping in the area and the food and service is always good. A couple of times there has been a bit of a line, but they move through them pretty quickly and are still friendly in the process.  The food is what you would expect from a typical Boston Market location - which isn't a bad thing, consistency is a good thing when you have a feel for what you are wanting to eat.

We have also used their locations for pre-packaged, re-heatable side dishes for holiday and such, which has always worked out well.

Overall: B+
Not a bad stop off for some instant food service with standard comfort dishes!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  

Absolutely one of the worst meals I've ever had.

I ordered pot pie and it was disgusting.  Vegetables that were obviously frozen, tasteless chicken, sauce that was gross, and a worthless crust that was made to be fraudulently \"flaky\" and yet robbed itself of any flavor.  Horrible.  Mind blowingly horrible.

The service was terrible.  The didn't really explain my option well, seemed annoyed that we were there, and didn't greet us or thank us.  I didn't feel welcome at all.

The place was FILTHY.  There wasn't a single clean table in the entire place.  I'm not talking about crumbs, I mean that there were used napkins and dishes on the tables.  They stayed there until after we left.  When I tried to clear my own dishes after we chocked down their disgusting food, one of the ladies there all but yelled at me that she needed to take care of it and not me.  I kind of rolled my eyes at that.  

They don't do themselves any favors with their prices.

Their pop was flat.  Also, I was annoyed by their nannying of me and the other customers by refusing to put out salt on the tables and making everyone ask to have a salt shaker.  In the place of the salt shaker, they put a condescending note in its place saying they were looking out for our health.  I can look out for my own health, thanks.

I will never eat here again.  Literally, I would rather choke down sardines in the bathroom of Wal-Mart than subject myself to this place ever again."}
{"text":"I did a carry out pick up order tonight. I had the three piece dark chicken, sweet potato with marshmallows and brown sugar. And their apple. It is a 20 minute ride home and the food was still hot. The lady that waited on me was very friendly. Antonisna was her name. When she talked it was hard to understand what she was saying. It sounded like she had her greeting memorized and her words ran together. But like I said she was friendly.  And the food was delicious. 
Boston Market has most of the time had excellent food ."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today. We've been here several times. My husband had the meatloaf with the tomato sauce, mac and cheese and the yellow rice everything was hot. I had the three piece dark chicken, sweet potato and the apple. Everything was hot for me also. We ate in the restaurant. Joe was who took care of us. He was very polite. Came a few times to our table to make sure we were happy. He greeted us when we came in and said to have a pleasant evening when we left. He seamed to be happy working there. The employees told every customer about the survey on the bottom of the receipt and if they come back next Saturday with their receipt and buy a meal they get the second meal free."}
{"text":"As you can tell this place is hit or miss with past reviewers...
I highly enjoyed it though!

I went there for the first time recently because I now work in the same plaza. Getting lunch here will most likely become a common occurrence.

I was greeted by smiling faces as soon as I got in the door. The dining area was clean. The food smelled great and was tended to by the busy employees. I got my tasty food quickly. (more about that later) But all in all, the customer service is what's going to bring me back again and again.
The employees here are so friendly! They have a special way with customers that is both polite and personal. They are professional but also show that they have their own individual personalities. That's what I look for in customer service employees-- anyone can tell me to have a nice day, but the ones who actually mean it are something special. That (along with the food of course) is what will bring me back to a restaurant.

Okay so on to the food:
There were a couple dishes that looked... not too fresh. However, the employees were replacing the soggy looking spinach with a freshly made batch when I was in there. It's not like it's being neglected. I ordered one of their Bowl Meals, with mashed potatoes, corn, and chicken all in one bowl. MMMMmmm... It was quick, cheap, and filling!

People need to remember when they come into a restaurant with a setup similar to Boston Market, they can't expect the freshest, top of the line food. You stand in a line and receive your food when you pay. It is fast food, except it's actually delicious and there's no questionable pink slime \"chicken\" nuggets (I'm looking at you McDonald's). If you have unrealistic expectations, you're going to be let down."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. Very nice and friendly staff, courteous manager that was very attentive to the customers and his staff, and clean dining room. Lastly, we went at an off time (not during main meal hrs; 3 pm) and the food was fresh and not crusted like most others look like when they sit for awhile. Liked much."}
{"text":"The Boston Market in Chicago was fantastic! The food was good and they had all you can eat soup at reasonable prices.

Just like every other hoodstablishment in Shittsburgh, this place sucks!

The chicken noodle soup is not on the menu and they are always out. The lady says what size, what size do you have? Huh (eye roll) small and large. Well what are the prices? Huh (eye roll 2x). I believe 4.99. 

When I get to the window its $8! How the H3ll did it go from $5 to $8 within a span of 5 seconds. She says, well that's how much it is. Well you can shove it!

Why the h3ll isn't the soup on the menu? Then we wouldn't have to spend 5 minutes in the drive through line discussing sizes and prices.

Why the h3ll do you have an attitude when a customer asks about a price since the item is NOT on your menu! While you were getting an attitude with me, you should have been learning the menu prices. I mean shouldn't there be some minimum knowledge even to work the drive through.

$8 for a bowl of soup is asinine. I can get unlimited soup salad and breadsticks from Olive Garden for less than that. I ended my suffering and went to Trader Joes and bought a bowl for 99 cent. 

I'm off Boston Market...."}
{"text":"Boston Market is open for Thanksgiving Day and this is the place I decided to go to for a quick bite and eat some turkey. They were so busy and I noticed so many angry customers on this day that it was a little bit on the scary side. 

Some were complaining of orders not being right and having to drive back and another was a man yelling about how their name was not called right. I mean it totally didn't seem very necessary. 

We just ordered on turkey plate with two sides of mashed potato and macaroni and cheese. It came with also a pie which we picked pumpkin. The taste was a bit too sweet for me. 

For how packed and busy this place was the manager I believe was handling it the best as she could. But what bothered me was that there were flies in the bread section and no one did anything about that."}
{"text":"I have come to this location more than once. The food is good. The service is okay. I don't hate the place. Its not bad but its not outstanding either. Its alright."}
{"text":"I have used Boston Market for my company holiday parties previously without incident.  However, For Thanksgiving some key parts of our order (gravy) were missing from our Turkey dinner order.  I decided to try the catering option to pick up at the store to see if I would get better results.  Much, much worse!  I arrived to pick up my order and the girl at the counter (possibly a manager) told me it would be a few minutes because they got a late start.  No big deal, I thought, even though their lack of preparedness is not my issue.  I sat there for 30 minutes and then had to pay extra for them not completing the order.  The young girl said \"sorry for the inconvenience.\"  There was no attempt to make it right.  I'm going to find an alternative for my company parties going forward."}
{"text":"Their half chicken meal is decent, but not the greatest. I really only go there once in a while for the cheap cornbread lol"}
{"text":"Never again will we order the meatloaf from here again. It smelled, looked and tasted like what I'd imagine cat/dog wet food to be. It was completely gross. The meat loaf smelled so strong in my kitchen garbage can  that I had to take the trash outside. Mashed Potatoes had a paste like consistency with the occasional lump. Green beans were covered in so much oil that they sloshed around in your mouth to such a degree they were difficult to chew. The \"beef gravy\" tasted like a bouillon cube that was dissolved in water mixed with flavorless gelatin. The consistency of the \"beef gravy\" resembled the slime from '80s Double Dare with a undesirable sheen that only can be created with extreme amounts of fat. Macaroni & Cheese tasted like it was left over from the lunch rush, seven hours earlier. So sad. One of my favorites, but much like skidz, Roos and Z Cavaricci, Boston Market time has past for me and I must move on."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. A home cooked meal at a great price. Got a half chicken and it was perfect.Will definitely be dining here again soon."}
{"text":"Kind of sad. Woman wearing a red apron (boss?) was pissy about our order. Wouldn't take the time to listen then complained that it was our fault. All of the sides were ice cold, except the spinach that they nuked. Man working the lobby. and good on them for hiring a learning impaired person, hovered over us, until I found some change in my pocket to give him. Not nice hovering, just \"give me a tip\" hovering. Second time we went, won't bother going back."}
{"text":"If ever there was a fast food place that I could say that I love, it would be Boston Market.  You go in, you order at the counter, you pay, you get your food and then take it to your seat just like every other fast food joint.  But here, you have fresh roasted chicken -- MMM.  

Today was an off day, though, and they had sold out of the chicken.  The associates said they had an untimely barrage of customers and that it would be ten more minutes before the next batch of chicken was ready,  not wanting to wait I opted to try one of their newer sandwiches and ordered:

Brisket and Swiss dip (au jus)
Mac n cheese
Mashed Potatoes and brown gravy

I love Boston Market's Mac n' cheese.  The noodles are spiral and always al dente -- today was no different. The mashed potatoes and gravy -- while obviously not homemade -- are always good with a little pepper.  I must say, though, that my chicken stand-in was also very good.  Not up to the fresh chicken standards; but good none-the-less.  The meat was moist and the au jus was flavorful.  I wish the bread was not as dry, but I had au jus so there was balance.

When needing food on the run, I will always go to Boston Market if given the choice."}
{"text":"We give this place 5 stars simply because of the excellent customer service.  The manager, Pete (who we have no connection to) was on his way out the door after working the day shift and saw an elderly woman eating by herself.  He quickly turned around and sat with her.  He had no idea who she was but took the time to find out. We need more compassionate people like Pete. 

The rotisserie chicken is pretty freakin' awesome too."}
{"text":"Just wanted some quick turkey protein and veggies. As always turkey was very good, mixed veggies were well prepared. The Brussels sprouts were a little sweeter than I usually like. Overall friendly and clean"}
{"text":"This Boston Market is the best location I have ever been to, and I have been to all of them in Phoenix and several in Chicago.  The people are SUPER nice, clean cut, and always smiling.  The food has always been top notch; hot and fresh!  It's like a home cooked meal from a family member."}
{"text":"Service is sloooowww if your a delivery driver! They are disorganized when it comes to delivery orders. They do not begin making the order until the driver calls or walks in."}
{"text":"What happened Boston Market?  You used to have a nice nutritious meal at a great price point. Now, portions are very skimpy, veggies are limp, turkey is full of gristle and, worst of all your gravy is horribly watered down. Still a notch above other fast food but, what happened?  C'mon, you can tell us."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We had a family meal for 3 and there was enough food for 4. The staff is very nice, smiling and happy attitudes. I'm going into a food coma now :)"}
{"text":"Boston Markets are the same anywhere, but the people who work here are great. This is my favorite one!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location all the time because it is up the street from me and I really love the market bowls and brownies and pecan pie I don't know what went wrong here but I stopped eating here because the rating has dropped way to low for me I hope they get it together"}
{"text":"Boston market is so good. Everyone time I go here the staff is very friendly. The food is always good. I know this is a roasted chicken place, but the meatloaf is so good. If you haven't tried the meatloaf, I would recommend it. The meatloaf kind of has a sweet flavor to it, so good. The price of the food is expensive but they give you a lot. You will probably be full off of one meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner Sunday night because I wanted something fresh and healthy.

I sure was happy I chose to visit an old favorite. I actually have been eating at Boston Market for many years, We would go to the valleys original location in Tempe, and back then it was a great place. Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south. I chalked that up to growth and just chose other dining options.

On last nights visit I was greeted by a friendly young lady who had that great \"we are happy you are here\" smile. I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.

After ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier. 

The meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.

Places like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night. Well somebody's doing there job and THAT'S FRESH!!!!

I recommend Boston Market if you have never been or haven't been in a while. It has to be the best meal in town under 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"Closed at 930 for the 3rd Tuesday I've tried to have a meal coming back into town. Employees leaving and cleaning while I'm pulling at the door. At least turn off your lights and sign so I know to be a guest somewhere that want my quick cash"}
{"text":"Ahh.this is a great comfort food pick-up place. Every time it's cold and dreary or i'm sick and craving the foods my mother used to make, I know I can be in and out and back home in 15 minutes if I come here. 

I'm a chicken lover- this is one of my favorite places. I get secretly happy when I order the 3pc dark and they give me 2 thighs and a leg, instead of vice versa. As far as other meats go, I think the turkey is bland, but the meatloaf is tasty. The pot pie is good if you're extra hungry- it's huge!

There are a wide variety of side dishes- recently they added side salads to the mix, and they've had fruit cups for awhile. You can get all sorts of hot sides, from the standard mashed potatoes and vegetables to creamed spinach, cinnamon apples, and creamy mac and cheese. You get a cornbread with each meal that you can either cover in butter or wad up into a ball and throw at somebody.  

The wait times are small, even during peak dinner time when the line goes to the door. Service is always friendly, and they are quite generous with the portions. On two occasions i've had to wait an extra amount of time for my meal- without asking, I was offered a drink twice along with a dessert once. This is a good option for fast but satisfying food."}
{"text":"We went in for meals last night, I ordered a chicken potpie and the person I was with ordered half a chicken meal, they wanted it cut into fours. However, when we received the meals (which was quick by the way!), the half chicken wasn't cut in fours. So, they asked the person at the cutting station (she put our meals together too), I swear that she was the most friendliest employee I have ever encountered, ANYWHERE! We later called this Boston Market to tell them how wonderful her communication and customer service skills were! Anyway, we got home, our food was good and it was everything that we asked for nothing was messed up."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Especially the one near 7th st Bell area! They have a drive thru that is fast and convenient! Great home cooked meals which I love when I'm in a hurry! Also love the buy one get one free that I can use Saturdays!:)"}
{"text":"Ordered at drive through.  
1/4 Rack of Ribs NOTE: Was up sold to the 1/2 rack [Wish I had stayed with my plan for a 1/4 chicken] 
New Garlic Potatoes
Mac & Cheese
Choc Cake Slice
Large Coke Zero

Upon arriving home, picked up my drink, squeezed the plastic cup a bit to maintain grip of a large drink and the plastic cup split about half way down about an inch long. Soaked the interior of my truck, and my iPhone.

Okay stuff happens, but then the food!  

First time having the ribs.  Just awful flavor of the sauce, and the rib meat was just \"off\". Not sure how to explain it other than, your expecting pork ribs, but got beef maybe?  Not sure what these were. 

The new potatoes. Were a bit crunchy like they were under cooked. The plastic fork broke off in the first one. 

The bottom layer of the cake was dried out, and not moist like the rest of the cake. How old was this piece? 

The only thing good was the mac and cheese, and the corn bread.   

I would have expected a lot more for $18.83 of for a single meal.  I tossed it out without eating most of it. 

Boston Market is usually decent, but your way off your game today. Not a fan of your new menu items at all.  

Please stick to what your good at, chicken.

Follow up note: I did call the restaurant the evening this happened just to advise them about the cup issue. This was before I tried eating the food so they were unaware of the other issues. Couple days later I did get a call from corporate regarding the drink, and they were only concerned if I was making a claim against BM for the damages. I said no, I cleaned it up myself, I was only making a comment as they might have an issue with their cups.  But I did take a moment to comment about the meal, and was advised I'd get a follow up call.   That was several days ago.  Don't bother, I've already made up my mind about my future purchases with BM. They will be limited."}
{"text":"food good, service terrible very slow not enough tables during lunchtime. come early before 11:45 am or after 1:30pm. They dont have enough staff to cover long lines.."}
{"text":"next to upmc hospital. new decor felt like a real restaurant. food was really good. clean , fast."}
{"text":"meatloaf, mashed potatoes, corn good. clean bathroom. lunchtime servers were nice. boston market is always my default place to eat if i am sight seeing."}
{"text":"Tasty!!!! I used to get the regular meatloaf dinner but it was too much food and I never ate all of it so one of the cashiers there advised that i get the \"Kids\" meal and substitute the cornbread for another side!! Best decision ive made this year!! Its just the right amount of food for any picky eater!! Im a little sad they dont serve the squash casserol anymore but the seasonal sides are fun to try!!"}
{"text":"I have so many great things to say about this location. 
1. They were open in Easter and while I don't really believe they should be it was convenient for me. I wish they were home with their families. 
2. The food was amazing. Like seriously awesome! Everything was piping hot when we picked it up and ready on time. We ordered ahead on the app. Very nice feature but would be even better if we could order for days ahead and not just day off. My favorite food? The sweet potatoes! Just yum! 
3. Price was very good. I will be back again."}
{"text":"If I'm ever looking for a place to get good, home style food without cooking it myself at home, Boston market is always my first stop."}
{"text":"I don't usually add comments to chain restaurants but I've been in this Boston Market in Lakewood several times and I have had the best customer service EACH TIME! Management must be doing something right!! Always a great experience!!! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"What is the first thing that comes to mind for you when you think of Boston Market? For me, it's chicken. Sure they serve meatloaf, turkey and numerous side dishes, but all of that is to compliment the rotisserie chicken, right? Well, I wish someone would tell these folks that. I cannot tell you how many times I've been to this Boston Market to find them 3 hours before they close for the day and to hear that they are out of chicken. 

I'm sorry, you're out of what?!? 

Yep. No chicken. They have plenty of meatloaf, though. If only I went there for meatloaf...

They are also known to be out of the side dishes I want constantly. I can't remember which it was last time, but when I got a third of a serving accompanied by a blank stare, I was told that it would be at least thirty minutes for them to make more. But the pan was empty before I got in there! Ahhh! 

...at least I wasn't the poor bastard behind me. He ordered chicken...and they were out...true story.

Now, in all honesty, the food they have - outside of that awful meatloaf - is pretty damned good. If we're in the mood for something \"homey\", we'll roll the dice on getting some chicken and delicious side items here where the people are friendly and, when they have chicken, its pretty good."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  There has been times when I had a fresh delicious turkey dinner and there has been times where my sides were cold and old."}
{"text":"Boston Market is always a great option for those of us wanting something close to \"home cooked\" on the affordable side. My kids love the selection of veggies and I appreciate that its a change from deep fried everything. It's a shame that there aren't more locations left. This location has always been convenient and the employees very pleasant. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is grimy, and the chicken noodle soup should be called \"uncooked onions in broth\" soup."}
{"text":"check your order before you leave.  got a chicken carver sandwich that was somehow crudely cut at 1/8th instead of half and the mash and gravy was just dry mashed potatoes.   This has been a fairly consistent experience with their drive thru...so In a way its my fault for going back.   but yeah, 10 bucks for a sandwich and mashed potatoes I'd expect it to be at least cut right."}
{"text":"We visit this location on a fairly regular basis. Generally the food is ok but they do have a bad habit of getting orders wrong or not giving you all of your items in the drive through. My wife drove through to grab dinner last night, and as I will often do, I had her also get a Chicken Salad sandwich for my lunch the next day.

As I was eating my sandwich today, I felt what could only be a hair in my mouth along with a piece of tomato. Sure enough, there was a long black hair wrapped around the piece of tomato. Since my hair is only about 1/2 inch long and this was quite long, no way was it mine. The thought of it and feel in my mouth is still grossing me out..."}
{"text":"So happy to find this store. I love the food. The staff is patient, and beyond friendly, and helpful!"}

{"text":"When I say I enjoy Boston Market people are like what... This is a one of a kind Boston Market the staff is always so friendly and will help you pick the best meal and joke around.  I always order the Quarter White Rotisserie Chicken with a side of Corn, Loaded Mashed Potatoes and Squash Casserole. The staff is so helpful they bring the food to what table you pick and are always around to fill your drink or get anything you need. The meal is always great and I can't get enough Squash Casserole so good...  I will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING! Order our Holiday dinner got confirmation and all. Went to pick up and they were closed, the lady said she didn't  know how the order went through after showing her the email confirmation. All she said she can do is apologize! Now we have no dinner for Christmas. Can't believe this, I only ordered cause I'm 8 months pregnant. What a mistake!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at any Boston Market in years and my hubby and I decided to eat here for lunch.  The staff we encountered during our visit provided excellent service- they greeted us as we walked in, they were patient with us choosing our entree selections, took our food to the table, and consistently checked on us while we ate.  I ordered the rotisserie turkey breast with mashed potatoes and gravy, along with the vegetable medley which consisted of carrots, broccoli, and zucchini; and I almost forgot the cornbread (yum).  The turkey was quite tasty as well as everything else, but the vegetables were just warm, not as hot as my other food.  Oh yeah, on Saturdays, they have buy one entree, get one free, which isn't a bad deal.  Overall, we had a pretty good experience and we will dine here again."}
{"text":"Let's start out with the good part of Boston Market. I think their food is really good. I have never had a bad food experience at any Boston Market. I wish there was a Boston Market bear where I live! I usually get the Turkey Carver Sandwich, which is my favorite item on the menu. I would always recommend Boston Market because the food is really good! With that being said, they do have negatives as well. I posted a photo of my sandwich, the amount of turkey I got was small compared to my bread. My tiny bowl of delicious Mac and Cheese and the cornbread. I would eat here everyday but it was over $11 for my meal. There are other places that are cheaper and get more food. So you have ask yourself, do you want good food & pay more or go a little cheaper for less quality of food. My meal was really good but not worth $11 and some change! Plus at this location, the staff was arguing with each other about things to clean and they were complaining about how slow it was at the time I was there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. We drove up to pick up dinner and three employees, in uniform, were all sitting in the parking lot smoking cigarettes. They looked at us super guiltily and put out their cigarettes and rushed inside. So sketchy! At that point we were too grossed out to go inside and have them touching and preparing all our food. We will not be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Best Boston Market I have been to. No question.

Boston is normally a 2-4 star price-performance selection in my book. This one is a solid 4. I bump this one up to a 5 (which I normally never give a franchise) because of spectacular service.

Score: I don't really score franchises by menu item. If it's a franchise - you probably like some items or you don't. Suffice it to say the half-chicken all dark and sides here are all solid 4 stars to me. Everything has been a 3+ here graded for Boston's expected quality.

Details: What makes this place a 5-star to me?

I rolled through here right after landing in town one day to grab some food for the Fam. Low and behold - they were out of everything I wanted. I arrived just between food-rotation shifts. Durn bad luck.

The lady running the place mentioned they still had extra of a few items I normally never sample at a Boston (like Meatloaf, and some sides I don't get). Asked if I wanted to try them and I said \"no\", and plus, I couldn't wait. So what does she do?

She hooked me up for FREE!. She had me try the meatloaf and something else....on the house. She even offered the sides on the house (I think they were changing them out anyway). I insisted on at least paying for the sides. I just can't justify taking food and not paying for some portion at a place I won't do regular business at. I hope this review doesn't get the manager in trouble.

Suffice it to say everything was great. My local family members go there often, and I look forward to heading back again next time I'm in Chandler.

Update: I have returned since I wrote this, and still found the service at this Boston's to be *excellent*"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, really nice people. Good service and yummy foods!!! Had the pot pie, it was great. So many sides."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Boston Market since they first opened.  I had all veggies & they were very good.  I was actually impressed with their mac & cheese & the creamed spinach was good, too.

Very casual, but very friendly.  The guests that were there seemed like neighborhood regulars & were also super friendly."}
{"text":"We recently visited again and I would have to say that will be the last time. The counter server just did not seem to want to be there. One side was about out but she decided to just give what was there. And I guess they no longer carry your plates out, or have trays. The location no longer has trash cans out either but asking to throw a bottle away seems like a horrible question to ask. We won't go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early dinner here a couple of days ago and I had the WORST dining experience EVER. The steamed veggies were soggy , the turkey was dry and needed more sauce and to top it all off, the waitress spilled lemonade on me and wasn't even apologetic at all! I would understand that accidents do happen but it won't hurt to say \"I am sorry\". Stay away from this place, there are other places you could go where there's good food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Turkey and chicken is good.

Everything else taste like hospital food at best depending on how long its been sitting."}
{"text":"Great place to get a \"home cooked\" meal. Boston Market in Strongsville seems to be always bumping. Order at the counter and they will serve you at the table, self serve refills. Food is always out in about 5 minutes and they even clean up after you :)  

I got the 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad which is a pretty good deal for under $6. The Rotisserie Chicken Carver sandwich has Rotisserie chicken with dijon mayo, cheddar, tomatoes and greens on a white or multi-grain roll. I recommend the multi-grain roll. The mediterranean salad is also very good. Good selection of greens, through some cornbread in on the side and you are good to go!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to say the young lady that just took my order here was very wonderful. I hope that she knows that I appreciated her very kind and helpful demeanor.  Absolutely wonderful service. Thank you for being you. You put a smile on my face and the gentleman before me! Food was pretty good also!"}
{"text":"My family went here for dinner and the customer service was excellent as well as the dinner selections. I like the the side dishes rotate so it's not always the same things. The young lady, Tanye was very friendly. We dined in and she double checked that everything was OK and that's not a sitdown type of restaurant so that was very kind of her to go out of her way."}
{"text":"This place was a lifesaver - was in Phoenix on a road trip when all three children got sick.  Must have been from all the candy and Thanksgiving food etc. at grandmas the day before.  They were in need of some good \"home-style\" chicken soup.  Well, in the area we were staying there was a CVS and Circle K on every corner yet no possible place for soup.  I also stopped into three separate Subways who all had only broccoli cheese soup... weird ...  then I turned a corner and there it was Boston Market, place was empty as if they were waiting for me.  I got two dinner plates and a huge family size chicken soup, great great service, extra bowls and plates etc, Rushed it back to the hotel.  Kids ate, tummys felt better and they went to sleep.  Mission accomplished!  The food is fresh and has that home made feel/taste...  What a welcome thing on a long road trip."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star rating I would.  Easily the worst experience ever.

12/24 I showed up 20 min late for my catering order, figuring all would be  ready.  There was exactly one other customer in the restaurant besides myself.  Guy at the carving counter (bald, glasses) asked me my name and that was the last I saw of him for the next 30 minutes.

No explanations, no nothing.  In short succession, the other 3 employees also disappeared in the backroom, leaving nobody in the front of the restaurant and giving me no clue what the hell was going on.

Finally after 30 minutes waiting I asked what the problem was and I was told that *I* called and changed the pickup time on my catering order.  Um, no I didn't and nobody knew I was getting it where I was delivering it, so nobody called on my behalf either.

The \"supervisor\" (African American, light skinned, black shirt/heavily stained, no name tag) makes a huge show of walking up to the table I was sitting at, looking in the catering box at the sheet for it (my order) and yelling to one of the workers across the restaurant \"YEP! 1pm!\" and walks away, completely ignoring me.  Finally 45 min later I got my food.

The portion for catering is a joke. I called Boston Market corporate: for 5 people the turkey you get is 1lb8 oz.  24 ounces for five people. So, roughly five ounces per person.  After 40 minutes, I got 7 pieces of turkey, weighing exactly what was expected. The slices were thicker than my pinky nail and I'm sure a blind man did the carving.  Thanks to this, two people I paid for couldn't even eat.  My mistake for not realizing Boston Market was going to screw me on this to the tune of 60 bucks.

The Mac/Cheese was sour.  Not just someone made it wrong. This tasted like someone squeezed a lemon in it; completely inedible.  Considering the utter contempt I was treated with, it's not hard for me to imagine at all that somebody did exactly that to my food.

The mashed was, well, it's mashed from a box.  You can't screw those up because the bar is so low to begin with.

ALL the muffins were stale.  Every one of them was rock hard.  

If this place were my only choice on earth or dogfood, I'd eat dog food.  

NO way in the world I'd ever go back between the utter customer mistreat and the lousy food.  If I were the actual manager of this place, I'd have handed out pink slips for Christmas.  I'd have been totally forgiving if the place were packed but it wasn't for any of the 40 minutes they got their jollies off by making me sit and wait when they're the ones that got the time wrong to begin with.

I have a complaint lodged with Boston corporate I'm waiting for them to call me back on, and I'll keep calling until I get this resolved.

If you want your holiday catering order screwed up, this is the place to go.  If you want decent food, ready for you when you asked for it - go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"I'm just like everyone else who wants comfort food every now and again. Alas, I feel that BM's food has been missing the \"make you feel good\" mark in terms of comfort foods. And is it me or have they made the portions smaller for more money? That's upsetting."}
{"text":"2nd time around. Tried the new carrots which are actually good.but the customer service damn!  I Just don't u understand why people act like they doing you a favor by waiting on you. Wake up young people?!!!"}
{"text":"I love Boston Market. The food is warm and it hits the spot when you want a good dinner. It's not fine food of course, but you know what, I'm a simple man. It's good.

The reason for my one star review, was because of their service. I just got back from a trip, so I figured I'd take 5 minutes to write about it real quick while it's fresh in my head and I'm eating their food.

I ordered online to take it out. It's a late night here at work, and this Boston Market is just down the street from the office, so I got me and the team some dinner. It said it would be ready at 7:18 pm when I was checking out my order online on the website, so about 20 minutes. Nothing too hard, 20 minutes is fine. Cool.

When I arrive there, I tell them I'm picking up my order. Everyone up front and in the kitchen looked like they were in training. All in their young 20's, maybe late teens. All seemed to be struggling to organize the couple of orders they had. 3 people were there, counting me. 3-4 people were on the line making the dinner plates. The cashier printed out my receipt, makes a mistake, asks for my receipt back, and etc.

Then he says, \"Okay, we'll get this made for you right now.\"

...Huh? So I ordered online for nothing or something?

I waited about another 15-20 minutes. Order was finally ready. I take it back to the office five minutes away. I eat the first bite, the vegetables and meat were sort of cold. Like room temperature at best.

I don't blame the kids up there working. They were doing their best, they weren't joking around, they just seem overwhelmed and learning. I blame the manager for putting them all up there. Horrible decision. Horrible service. And to end it all, when I got back and handed out dinner to everyone, I realized I forgot drinks. I admit, that was probably all my fault though. They said \"You're good to go\" when my order was finally ready, and I just took it and left. 

I paid for those drinks but you know what? I didn't care anymore. Too frustrated."}
{"text":"Good homestyle American fare. High quality ingredients, well prepared. Liked the new gourmet sides of loaded potatoes and Mediterranean green beans. I think the quarter dark plate with 2 sides is pretty good especially if you use one of the free soft drink or $1 coupons in the paper or from their website.

Service was good, and restaurant super clean when I went. Oh yeah, pretty cool to get real plates and silverware when dining in."}
{"text":"Service here at Boston Market deserves not one good complement at all. My mother and I wanted to come and eat for knowing in the past that Boston Market had pleased us. But when we arrived it was not what was expected. We told a young man by the name of Darnell our order and he asked us over and over what we wanted again. He then was scooping my mother's side dishes in bit by bit not as a heaping spoonful as usual and then he would scoop more off of her plate and back into the tray. Then my mother asked for Creamed Spinach  and you could tell that it had been sitting there for awhile because it had sort of hardened at the top. Josh then came with \"fresh hot\" Creamed Spinach.  We then checked out and sat down to eat. My mother's Spinach was cold. We called over the manager and she got us a hot one. We then saw a lady ordering but Josh blew his nose and threw his tissue away but did not wash his hands. He instead reached for the woman's plate and started loading things on. My mother said \"you should really wash your hands...and throw that plate away and use a new one.\" The woman thanked us and continued to order. We asked the manager for corporates phone number. We will be calling."}
{"text":"It's sad to see how some supervisors refuse to take care of there customers. I am a customer who goes everyday to buy my lunch at this Boston market. Well today Monday I had the worst experience ever. I was asked if I wanted the rosemary chicken. I asked to get the sauce on the side so if I didn't like it I didn't waste money on something I wasn't going to eat. The manager refused and said that the company policy did not allow for that to happen. She asked who sold me my meal yesterday and said she was going to talk to them. They should not get in trouble for going the extra mile to take care of there regular customers. I spend at least $80 a week buying my lunches there everyday and for the manager Wanda to refuse to go that extra mile is wrong.
I will probably no longer eat or recommend this place to anyone. Because of this manager."}
{"text":"WOW - must be the new management. The service was the best I've seen in 12+ years I've visited this place. 
The food has always been good, service - not so much. 

Keep up the good service and be back more often :)"}
{"text":"Still recovering from some sort of mystery stomach bug, the only thing I could eat last week without feeling sick was plain chicken and vegetables. Also not feeling like cooking due to my broken stomach, I headed over to this Boston Market location for a half chicken individual meal. You get your choice of two sides with the meal and I went with the steamed vegetables and green beans. Service was friendly fast and efficient. I was out the door in no time.

The chicken was tender, well seasoned and juicy. The vegetables were simply steamed, and I think the green beans were lightly seasoned with butter. There was a piece of cornbread with the meal too. The total was around $9 which wasn't a bad deal for all the food I got."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this outing at Boston Market. A few years ago, I had eaten at this location and wasn't particularly wowed by the food or the service. But now, they have improved by leaps and bounds. They're really focusing on a more comfortable, cozy environment for patrons that wish to dine on their homey Americana style eats with a fast-food type efficiency.

After you place your order, the cashier will bring your food to your table. If you get your order to eat in, they will serve it on some white plates with silverware. The workers here are fast and efficient, and are friendly even in high traffic times. When they can, the staff will come around and ask if you need anything, and will clear your table for you. The service here has been better than at some sit-down full service restaurants I've been to!

They offer deals now which are great if you are dining with another person. For $20, you can get 2 individual meals, 2 drinks, and 2 desserts! Quite a lot of food for a decent price."}
{"text":"This place is BAD..... they dont know how to cut up there meat well all of the meat has the extra fat and nastiness that you dont want to eat i would NEVER. Advise any of you to go here i dont want to go there again myself."}
{"text":"I stopped by last Thursday after a lengthy absence. I don't mind the restaurant in general, but when my former roommate and I moved to Phoenix in 2004 we didn't know the town and we didn't immediately venture too far away from the apartment. She loved Boston Market and dinner what seemed like nightly was there. We kept going back because every time we visited we received a coupon on the receipt for a buy one get one free meal. When I was able to avoid going constantly I stopped and hadn't returned.

I am searching for a rental home in Chandler, and as I was driving by around lunch time I noticed the old Boston Market we used to visit - so I decided to stop. I ordered the meatloaf, and that is definitely one of the best. I would say the 1/2 chicken and the turkey would be my other main selections. The mac & cheese is excellent, and I chose the garlicky spinach for the second side. As a meal it comes with the entree, two sides, and a corn bread. About $8 without a drink and upon check out I received, you guessed it - a buy one get on free coupon. Those are only good for specific dates -  mine was for two days hence, but I am not in that area too much now I skipped it. The meal was excellent and maybe heightened in appreciation since I no longer have it daily."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but it's a good one. This location is always clean and the food is fresh. I've never had a bad meal. The chicken is good as is the turkey. Spiral Mac and cheese and mixed vegetables are my favorite sides, but they have many more to choose from. It's nice to have a close fast food option that doesn't include a burger or anything fried."}
{"text":"I frequent this location before work quite a bit since I start work right around the normal dinner time. Always clean, friendly, and good food. They have real silverware and \"real\" plastic plates! Lol."}
{"text":"This is not a place that I would normally go to but my brother said I'm craving it. What to do what to do this is been going on for a week so finally I said behind will eat at Boston market if you have ever been in jail this food could possibly be delicious For you but for all the rest of us on the outside this is slop if you like overcooked vegetables overcooked chicken covered in nasty Gravy this is the place for you all I can say is yuck not for me but if you like it eat it"}
{"text":"My mother called our order in for 2 meals (each with 2 sides) and we ordered an extra side for each meal.  I picked up the order and was asked what the order name was.  When the order was brought to me I was asked if it was a family meal.  I said I did not know as I was not the one that placed the order.  Upon arriving to our hotel we observed that some of our order was there; however, it was missing a mashed potato, side salad, and creamed spinach.  Instead, it had 2 extra orders of mac and cheese and a dessert.  We decided to eat it anyway because we are a few miles away, I'm pregnant, and have a toddler as well.  Upon calling them to see what they could do for us about mixing up a few of our side items, we were talked to by the manager as if this were our fault.  She told us the only option was to come back and get our correct order.  Apparently we were given a family of 6 meal that cost $100 instead of our meal that cost $20 (if what we got was $100, I'd never buy this family meal...it was NOT $100 worth of food).  The manager said that I was asked if we ordered a family meal (I was) and she said that I said yes (I actually said I didn't know because my mom placed the order).  Again, she stated this was our fault because we accepted the wrong order and it was for more than what we ordered and paid for (and continuously told us the employee that I spoke with was new and he didn't know better).  We continuously asked her how she would fix this and her answer was always that we already ate it and it couldn't be replaced.  We asked if next time we come in we could be given the side items we didn't get this time, for free.  She said it would have to be now.  Again, we were at a hotel with a toddler and I'm pregnant.  I was not about to go out AGAIN, to pick up our food that was wrong.  This was an extremely frustrating situation, being that we are stuck in a hotel and I'm pregnant.  This was horrible customer service and we will never be returning.  I am still flabbergasted about the way we were spoken to about 'accepting' an order that was apparently so much more money than what we paid for."}
{"text":"Love the chicken.... went through the drive through and the employee did not place any napkins or silverware in the to go bag. It is hard to eat mashed potatoes and gravy with your fingers."}
{"text":"Food was fine but the service was terrible, there was one person ahead of me but I waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Once the customer ahead of me was done the manager and 3 employees stood around talking for about 5-10 minutes while no one was serving guests !"}
{"text":"When you mention fast food, Boston Market is never one of the places that comes to mind.  In that respect, it's like Wendy's.  It just never enters into the equation, though it's generally at least as fast as other options (and probably about as healthy in many respects).

I think part of the problem is that I can never decide what to order.  When I can't figure out what I want, I don't like going there.  This is true at places that have massive menus, or places that just don't tickle my fancy, and it's true at Boston Market.

I think they were one of the first places I noticed where they tend to obscure their menu choices somewhat.  Now lots of places do it (see McDonalds), but at those places, I know what I want, so it doesn't really matter.

In any case - I never know what I want, so I end up panicking in line and ordering something I don't really want, and end up unhappy.  The good news here is that the staff is nice, and the food is fresh.  It's just not what I wanted, which leaves me unhappy spending what I did for the food."}
{"text":"Like the P-man, I not only forget about the Boston Market here when I drive by, but I forget that I've been here half a dozen (or more) times and that I need to review the place.

Now there is nothing much special about this location. It is a Boston Market. If you have been to one, you have likely been to every other one. About the only thing that stands out is that getting in and out works pretty well, provided you are traveling in the right direction. Luckily, that is almost any direction, other than from Matthews on Sam Newell.

Once inside, the place is of a reasonable size, and the staff is nice enough - but it just exudes a sort of cold air, even in the middle of the summer. It could be because the dining section is so far away from the counter, but whatever the case, you might be better taking your food to go, as the food itself is fine - the place is what seems to make (or break) it here."}
{"text":"I will defintley be going toba differwnt boston market the food was delicious but the customer service sucked the manager joe was getting mad at a deaf guy because he was unable to talk he is very rude with the customers he acts like his job is so hard"}
{"text":"After seeing your commercial we decided to get dinner last night from Boston Market via the drive thru. When we got home we were highly disappointed in the portion size! Somebody was not paying attention when portioning out the food, as one of our meals was a 3-piece dark meat. Someone didn't notice we only actually got two pieces of chicken. The leg meat of one piece had fallen to the side. So, we actually got two pieces and a meatless bone.
The food quality was still yummy however frustrating to not see this error until we're unpackaging the food at home. Boston Market is NOT one of the cheaper options for dinner, so it is expected to get what you're paying for. And this case we did not."}
{"text":"Had BBQ ribs corn mashed potatoes sweet potato cobbler corn bread whole chicken. Enjoyed everything.  Ribs were moist. Chicken was on point. Got food for a house warming party and everyone liked it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in almost 12 yrs. and now I remember why. After the greasy chicken, bland mash potatoes w/watered down gravy. It was the worst $10 I ever spent, I couldn't even eat it all."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Our food was vile. The ribs has more fat than meat & the roasted potatoes were overcooked and swimming in grease. Ick! Unfortunately we went thru the drive thru. If we ate there I would have brought it back to the counter. 
Used to love Boston Market. What happened?"}
{"text":"I really love Boston Market. Its not QUITE fast food but is fast food. Always delicious. It worries me that no matter what location I go to there is only maybe 1 other person in there and Boston Market wont be around much longer"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $24. Paid $12. September 30th was a big day for Boston Market and they celebrated by giving customers BOGO entreès! Therefore, we had Boston Market two nights in a row  This location is fast and we were greeted as soon as we walked in the door. The guy working the register could have more personality but it's tough having to carry around a mustache like that. I have not seen this place when it is busy which is a shame because they have the best mac and cheese and some pretty bombdotcom chicken noodle soup - it's my go to when I have a cold. The only down side is it's pricey. The sides should be bigger for the price, but with a coupon it's not so bad. Sign up for their email club and get $3 iff $10."}
{"text":"Never been to a Boston Market?  

They basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.

Pay, sit down and eat.

I like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.

The sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.

I'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered \"Welcome to BM!\"  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch."}
{"text":"Every time I have come here the food has always been good and customer service is great. The mac and cheese, corn, cornbread, and stuffing are very good sides! My boyfriend always gets turkey and I get chicken both good meat choices! The only issue I have is with the location if you come during the day the independence traffic sucks and at night the area is kinda ehhh but that doesn't have anything to do with the food and quality both good."}
{"text":"I always feel like I am in a cafeteria when I'm at a Boston Market, but this one? It makes me feel like I'm in a cafeteria... a sanitarium cafeteria. The place was gross. Not sanitary. Food was old and gray. The place creeped me out. Big thumbs down"}
{"text":"Very slow service, obviously ordering  ahead means nothing to them. Should have gone to Del Taco across the street."}
{"text":"A bit of a sad location. Usually I feel good going in a Boston Market,  not ecstatic but definitely in there to satisfy comfort food cravings. I just don't get that nice vibe from this specific location. Has nothing to do with the food or the people, they're both as nice as any other Boston Market. It's sorta crammed in the end of a parking lot. The views are to homeless people on the corner of 19av+Northern to one side and half walls all around, a bit institution-like. That combined with very few patrons, it almost feels like a punishment to eat there. I haven't tried takeout, which I guess would fix the ambiance problem, but with so many other 4-5 star reviewed restaurants in the area,  it's hard to keep giving it the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of 'BM'!  I have been going there for years, and absolutely LOVE their rotisserie chicken!  Their BBQ pulled chicken sandwich is fantastic!  There is also a good selection of sides too.  If I had only one gripe, it would be that their prices are a bit too steep, in my opinion.  I can get as good, if not better chicken at many of the local diners and family restaurants around NE Ohio that 'do chicken right'!  And for much less money."}
{"text":"This is actually kind of sad. The customer service here is very good. Food was served quickly and tasted fine. Here's my problem. I ordered a 3 pc meal. What I got was two pieces of chicken (leg & thigh) and the one thigh had been cut into two pieces. No, really, I'm not kidding! (see photo) WTF? Are you kidding me. Then, once you get to your table and sit down, you realize the Salt Police have left a note insinuating that your eating too much Sodium and you need some extra exercise if you want the salt shaker because you have to get back up and go get one. COME ON GUYS! For a $10 meal I want 3 REAL pieces of chicken and a salt shaker! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a late lunch.  I ordered the 1/4 white, green beans, and potato wedges.  Chicken was good but very small and slightly dry.  Green beans were tasty (but not fresh) and I would guess the potatoes were tasty a long time ago.  They were dried up and you could hardly bite into them. Corn bread was fresh and good.  We used to eat in Boston all the time, but probably won't be going back.   If you are going to serve the same lunch food, that has been sitting in the steamer tables for hours, maybe it would be just better to close the doors until dinner time."}
{"text":"The service was great at this location
The young girl helping me choose my dish was super helpful
She woo'd me into trying the new pork ribs
She was so cool and friendly that I trusted her opinion. I ended up getting the ribs with Mac and cheese and stuffing as both of my sides 
My evening meal was great and it all started with that warm, friendly recommendation from the customer service 
This location is pretty much like every Boston Market, inside and out as far as decor and menu
Yumzo!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here the other night and I enjoyed it :) I got the chicken breast with Mac and cheese as well as mashed potatoes. It came with a yummy piece of corn bread too. 

They have Sriracha by the bottle which every restaurant should have ;) 

The price was great and id recommend it to families or anyone just wanting a decent meal, either on the go or sitting down"}
{"text":"I go there for lunch at least twice a week I Love this place, and their new Select Chicken Sandwiches, very juicy. Very clean, and fast service. Really good costumer service. The older lady that's there at nights is very generous and is always attentive to the costumers wants."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and welcoming . The interior was clean with the exception of the men's bathroom. That was a mess. The food was good. Nora went out of her way to assist us with our meal selection. Glad she did. Would stop back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Boston Market, is well, Boston Market.  But, I like it, and thier food is good, chain or no chain.  I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars, but decided I would up them to four stars, since thier food tastes pretty good.

I went here for Thanksgiving dinner, and the service was wonderful.  People were friendly here, considering that they are stuck working on a holiday serving others thier holiday dinner.  Place was clean, but the Turkey was kind of dry.  BUT, it beats that over processed crap your going to get anywhere else."}
{"text":"I just want to thank Carl for making this trip! It was my first time to a Boston Market so the menu was confusing to me but Carl explained it to me and I got a awesome lunch! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"11:20 and drive thru is blocked with no explanation. Inside is open, just no drive thru. Why offer the drive-thru if it isn't open? The last few times we used the drive thru, they forgot items. So maybe they are retraining people or closing it permanently. But some sort of explanation/sign would be nice."}
{"text":"This place is the worst run establishment I've ever been to, manager has no clue what his employees are doing or how to fix an issue when something is going wrong. Food will sit on plates while confused employees try to figure out what is happening. They also now slice and vacuum seal the turkey at 11am in the morning and let it sit in a heat drawer all day continuing to cook, so it's like trying to eat a piece of leather by the dinner time hour. Had an online order and was given a 20 minute lead time, I arrive at the location only to be told they have sold the last of the pot pies and I have to wait an additional 20 minuets past my given time of pick up! The only reason I come back is once the food is correct I do enjoy it and there is no other convenient location in my area, so be prepared for long wait times and indifferent employees!"}
{"text":"Good service, by far the best tasting healthy option fast food you will get. Faster than McDonald's drive thru. Love the quarter and half chicken plate. Brings food to table on a plate. Hank you for the fast option."}
{"text":"We were greeted as we walked in. Service was quick, staff was friendly, food was fresh, and the restaurant was very clean. An employee came over to our table to ask if everything thing was good and to see if we needed anything. I recommend this location."}
{"text":"Had not been to Boston Market in a long time. Decided to eat there yesterday.    
Was welcomed when I first entered the restaurant, who was I believe a shift manager.  He explained about their special of 1/2 chicken+ 2 sides, and after some contemplation I decided to get it.  A nice dark golden brown color that almost melted in your mouth, so tender & juicy that you could separate the drumstick from the Brest cage with just a butter knife.  I had Ice Tea to drink and really like the tea dispenser.  Restaurant was clean and well kept, not to mention after the bill was paid they carried my meal to the table for me.  Was really surprised at that one.  Also I went to  discard my garbage and noticed a sign explaining that they would take care it, I noticed the sign after I had already gotten to the garbage can, but still a definitely nice touch.  The only real complaint I had was it felt like I was sitting in a walk-in cooler.  I enjoy cold but this was to cold. As a result my food did get cold before I finished it, however I still was able to enjoy my food, and the person I was eating with.  If you have not been to Boston Market in a while, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I walked in and wasn't greeted. Woman at the counter was meh...literally didn't smile once. Gave me a mean look when I didn't know what kind of bread they had. The cook Sean needs to be the front desk rep because he was friendly right away!:)"}
{"text":"Great service! There was a guy named Morris and he was was really cool and helpful! From the minute we walked in we were welcomed! thanks guys"}
{"text":"Prices went too bad. Food was excellent. I love Boston Market when I want a \"home cooked\" meal away from home. Chicken, potatoes, mac-n-cheese, and cornbread! Place was clean and food was excellent. I wish there were more around town."}
{"text":"Very personable staff, but the food left a lot to be desired. The chicken was so greasy that I had to take the skin off (which honestly, is the best part). I ordered quarter white meal and the breast was meaty, but the wing and the undercarriage had no meat. The mashed potatoes were dry and tasteless and the green beans were watery. Cornbread was ok. I was greeted properly and taken good care of during a lunch rush, but don't know if I will give it another try because of the just so-so food."}
{"text":"Boston Market really gave my roommate and I one easy, satisfying Thanksgiving tonight!  I am so glad they were open and the food was really that good! 

     I do feel bad in a way that the employees here had to work on Thanksgiving but there were 6 of them behind the counter and they were all contributing something to help each customer.  They were fairly busy as that was kind of expected, I mean, it was Thanksgiving after all and in today's time (and preparing for Black Friday) more people are looking for the \"easy\" route in making Thanksgiving. This Boston Market being open until 7pm on Thanksgiving helped us with that and had a positive impact as well.  

     My roommate and I have been very busy with trying to clean up, fix and prepare her parents house and we have been working on this for 6 months and meanwhile she had to study for a test.  Pretty much, cooking for us on Thanksgiving was going to be difficult.  We didn't have time and I couldn't prepare all of that myself.  So, I looked around online and saw that not only Boston Market was open on Thanksgiving but that they had several options in making an entire Thanksgiving!  Well, I won't list all the options (trust me when I say this, there were SEVERAL from feeding yourself to feeding 12 people for $119.99 with multiple options!) but I looked over their menu choices and saw the feast for 3 at $34.99.  This was quite the deal in our opinions.  This meal deal included 1 1/2 rotisserie chickens (we are not big fans with turkey but if chicken is available next to turkey, we would chose chicken pretty much every time so we chose chicken).  3 large side dishes, 3 cornbread muffins and your choice of either a whole apple or whole pumpkin pie. We chose pumpkin.  A nice combination for all of us because we were sharing this with my roommates parents for a total of 4 people but her parents do not usually have a big appetite.  As a gift to my roommate and all her hard work, I bought this for her parents and us.  
     The food was excellent.  Now, I really mean the food was good because Boston Market was facing one of their BIGGEST critics and that would be my roommate's mom.  She is one of the pickiest, particular and judgmental eaters I have ever met!  Usually everything is either \"too salty\" or \"too sweet\".  Well, when she tried this chicken, vegetable stuffing, mashed potatoes and green beans, not one complaint.  Not one negative comment or dislike and we even received a \"It's good\" from her and I was SO happy!  That was the greatest Thanksgiving gift I could have received!  
     Overall, we are definitely coming back to this Boston Market.  It is close to where and what we need.  The quantity, quality and price are all decent here for what you receive.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying something else on the menu.  Maybe their meatloaf or ribs?
Their menu is worth a look and a try."}
{"text":"Great service by the youthful staff but the food was awful. The chicken was tough and the roast potatoes were rubber, etc etc. What happened to this formerly reliably tasty alternative to fast food?"}
{"text":"The chicken salad on 9 grain bun is fabulous. The creamed spinach is great as well as the mashed potatoes. They are usually running some special-got a full roasted chicken, 2 sides  and corn bread for $12.99. 

Always clean and very nice staff. However the woman's bathroom looks like it has been pried open and I scared myself trying to get out of it -lock jammed and was hard to open. 

Parking lot, casual dress."}
{"text":"I was so excited to be getting a Boston Market at the BX as it was one of my favorite places to go to lunch as a child. I went on opening day, but not at a peak time. The staff was very friendly, the portions are generous, and the food looked fresh and not as if it had been sitting awhile. 

They forgot the sauce I asked for, but that was ok. The chicken was amazing, literally falling off the bone, and ugh that cornbread. So, so good :) keep it up, and best of luck!"}
{"text":"Boston market saved our thanksgiving! When we ruined our turkey plan we had no where else to turn! Boston market provided us with 4 pounds of turkey on the spot and the customer service was excellent!! Thank you so much for working on thanksgiving, the turkey was amazing !"}
{"text":"I should have turned around and left when the girl putting cornbread in the bag threw the utensil down (where her hands were touching) unto the rest of the bread while using profanity under her breath because someone in the drive-through expressed they had an allergy. My experience continued for the worse when my three piece dark was a two piece, with the one being cut in half. It then became hard to eat  my meal and listen to the workers ( the younger girls) bicker and use profanity about cleaning the bathrooms and leaving early. I believe I even heard one say something about a COCKROACH. Not sure if there is a manager here but if there is what a disgrace for allowing your staff to act like this. I never been to a restaurant where the works were louder then the patrons. Until sometime is done about this I will never revisit this location."}
{"text":"Terrific food, clean dining area, and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Not sure why this Boston Market has such a low rating. After living in North Phoenix a year, it has been one of my favorite restaurants to frequent, especially on days when I am really hungry after getting off work. Every time I have come in here the customer service has been on point and a homestyle meal is ready for me almost immediately. I recommend visiting on Wednesday, Friday or Sunday night for the Prime Rib (They finally added something to the menu to make up for getting rid of the sirloin tips like 10 years ago). You also can never go wrong with the rotissere chicken."}
{"text":"I base my stars on what type of restaurant/eatery it is. For Boston Market, I expected some sort of slightly more upscale fast food joint based on reviews from all sorts of places, but it went beyond my expectations. It's mostly catered toward takeout I suppose, so you order and pay in front of a counter that displays the actual side items and menus at the back, and then seat yourself.
First of all, the cashier, Rachelle, was extremely friendly, so that was enjoyable! I ordered the market bowl and she accidentally gave me a cornbread but waved it off as free xD In any case, the turkey breast was wonderful - thick, juicy cubes covered with a flavorful beef gravy sauce. The steamed vegetables were well made - not mushy/overcooked - and although the mac and cheese was a bit too creamy for my tastes, it wasn't bad. The cornbread was a bit too crispy on the bottom and dry, but after a whole day of sitting under the heat lamp, it's not too surprising.

So I will be back! Despite the occasional whole rotisserie chicken that my family would buy, I've never visited for meals, and I'm very glad I did."}
{"text":"I'm slightly biased, I used to work for Boston Chicken and Boston Market. Back in the day it couldn't be beat, they made everything from scratch in the restaurant with few exceptions.

In the late 90s they outsourced their food and today everything comes frozen in a bag, already made. They thaw it, heat it and serve it, all to cut costs. The quality isn't there anymore. The customers aren't either. I can remember 45 minute long lines at dinner time to get a meal. Now there is never a line. There used to be 8-12 employees there during lunch and dinner. Now there are about 4. It's sad that they ran this once great concept into the ground.

The food is OK, overpriced, nothing special."}
{"text":"I heard a rumour that there was a actual Boston market in Charlotte NC I Found it!! I loved fried Chicken but enough you all make the best find chicken down here but this it what I have been missing the roasted chicken is the best I got a quarter chicken white with sweet potatoes and reg mashed potatoes and corn bread and veggies Wow is it all good! So get in vechicle and go to this great food place Do It for yourself do it for the family just go"}
{"text":"Everything there is pretty good EXCEPT for the Chicken Noodle Soup - they used ALL DARK MEAT and it was definitely OLD MEAT.  We threw it out.  This was carryout, so I don't think we would every order it THERE dine in OR CARRYOUT again- it was rank.  Don't order the chicken noodle soup.  For the price we paid for a tiny bowl of soup it should have WHITE MEAT and tasted FRESH - yuk."}
{"text":"Went to pick up dinner tonight at Boston Market, and received excellent service. Joey, one of the Boston Market employees, helped me pick out a low calorie meat entree and was very knowledgeable about their selection. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Boston market is the best quick homestyle meal thing you can get. Every side of theres is just amazing. Everyine knows how great the mac n cheese is, but the sweet potato casserole is soooo good as wwll. Its sweet with that brown sugar topping. The chicken noodle soup is endless and is also extemely tasty.  very good noodle and meat portions. The prices are under 10 bucks and you dont have to tip. The mashed potaoes and gravy are good probably because theyre gravy could make anything taste amazing!"}
{"text":"The workers do not look happy anymore. They charge extra for the sides that was there before. The 2 for 20 scimps the portions & you cannot pick desserts. The rice I& brussel sprouts are always hard. The people have their fingers in the plates, the doors do not stay open for handicaps."}
{"text":"Place brings too many transients hanging around inside and out, no one asks them to leave. They hang out in test rooms.Servers does not wear gloves, hands in plates"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant as a kid when we went out to eat as a family! The rotisserie chicken is moist and tastes great! The macaroni is just as I remember creamy and cheesy!! The mashed potatoes are also pretty good! The only thing that I do not like about this place is that they did not give me two pieces of chicken like they were supposed to. I only got a breast but it filled me up."}
{"text":"Cosmic Trickster, I am not amused. What are you trying to teach me? That fast food eats castor oil popsicles? Did I write too many favorable reviews for chains? 

Well, Boston Market isn't too, too bad actually. This was my first BM encounter in more than a few moons.

I used to really, really like Rotisserie chickens. I still do actually. They used to be an occasional, spontaneous treat when brought home from a deli ('Hey! Rotisserie! Let's get one!'). So when the Boston Market franchise first came on the scene, I was fairly excited about the prospect of getting roasted chickens pretty much whenever I wanted from a restaurant that specializes in them. No, I've never been to a Kenny Roger's Roasters and it's been 7-8 years since I've been to a George Aiken's. Boston Market (formerly Boston Chicken) has also seemingly branched out into other areas, going out of their way to offer a homey take on fast food, the idea being that you can eat a BM meal at home in your dining room with the good silverware on the good plates, reserving Crazy Bread or McNuggets for the woodland critters out in the backyard. 

Now the Boston Market chickens are tender enough (many places roast their chickens for too long), but I've always felt there was something missing from them. Actually, I take that back, their chickens have a funny taste I'm not sure I like, one that suggests that I'm dining on Frankenchickens or something. Is it because they're frozen? Not that they're awful in any way, mind you, I've just never liked their chickens as much as I feel I should. I guess the word I'm looking for is, bland?

Hooray for their army of side dishes. Well, they do give you a lot of choices, but like the chicken, they're mostly just passable. I usually get the green beans and the garlic dill taters, neither of which are bad nor rock my culinary socks off. But...wait...

...there's the...Cinnamon Apples.

These aren't a side dish. They are a dessert. I always forget how good they are until I have them, and while I'm eating them, I always imagine how good they would taste as a hot sundae topper. But I always end up eating them all before that happens and never have any ice cream around to slather the apples onto. 

Why is it that we were served applesauce in school and never the almost erotically warm Cinnamon Apples? Was the faculty afraid of corrupting us? Or spoiling us? Making us realize that school cafeteria fare doesn't have to suck? 

Staying on the dessert track, we had an order of their Chocolate Brownies, free I might add with some deal, and they are actually reasonably appetizing. They are cut into triangles, which is a nice touch. Instead of being heavy and gooey, they're just moist enough and very...cocoa-ish, as if you're munching on a soft Oreo cookie without the white stuff. 

What do you have in store for me next, Cosmic Trickster? Will you steer me towards the worst meal of my life, or the best? Methinks this was the calm before some sort of storm. A big concert weekend approaches after all...

Right now, I'm left with the remnants of a nice, safe 3 star dinner and Jon Stewart on the telly."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The service is also nice. The chicken is great. Boston Market is a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I've always like Boston Market, but my last visit here was exceptional, as there was an employee who was very nice and seemed genuinely pleasant. Customer service is everything. As far as the food goes, I always get a pot pie with a side of the sweet potato soufflé. Another thing I like about this Boston Market is that it's adjacent to a side street that runs into a light, so you can get out on Independence. Traffic can be rough out that way."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but I give it 4 stars rather than 5 stars because it's hot-lamp food and sometimes the loaded mashed potatoes aren't as hot as they should be."}
{"text":"For fast food, the service was a bit slow. That aside the food was awesome. My hubby got a 1/4 of a chicken meal with macaroni and cheese and fresh veggies. Both sides were delicious. The Mac and cheese was so creamy and cheesy. The vegetables were a mix of broccoli, carrots, zucchini and green beans and were tasty. I got the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was huge and divine. The sauce was a bit tangy and the roll was nice and hearty."}
{"text":"Omg the food was super tasty! I've never been here before, but I'd definitely come back again! The ladies working were super nice and attentive. They did a super great job (:"}
{"text":"Chicken is literally always dry. Other than that the food is pretty good for the price. Would recommend this place but probably should order something other than chicken. Service was great. Plenty of parking too. And not too busy."}
{"text":"About as good for you as fast food gets - I love their stuffing, green beans, and mashed potatoes. I usually stick with the chicken, but they also have meatloaf and pot pie. The corn bread sucks - its time they let it go!"}
{"text":"Staff does a decent job. Food here is tasty and healthier than the standard burger joint. I really like the market bowls. I get mine with rotisserie chicken, corn, cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I like Boston Market but there isn't one close to home so it's a bit of a drive. I got the Quarter White rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, and cornbread. It was pretty good. The mashed potatoes are like homemade (not instant). The cheese sauce in the macaroni tastes very similar to KFC... not a bad thing. I did have some trouble with the drinks. I wanted to make an Arnold Palmer with raspberry lemonade but it was coming out clear, and the tea was too strong on its own. But good meal overall."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on June 5th. First time at Boston Market . Staff was friendly. It was clean and seemed very organized. Wide variety of food selections. Everything looked fresh. We had meatloaf and turkey breast dinners. Both were tasty and fresh. Mashed potatoes and apple cinnamon were our sides with cornbread.  Very reasonable priced under $30 for both meals and drinks. Enjoyed the food and will return. They had one person clearing the tables since they handle cleaning off all tables. I didnt see anyone spray cleaning the table while i was there. Hopefully they do that. I am assuming they do....  Nice location with good food and service."}
{"text":"My my boyfriend  came here the other day. The chicken saying that he got was really really good I ended up taking half of his food. I decided to come back and get it myself. I ordered the meatloaf ( horrible choices) tasted like a can of dog food. The mashed potatoes were really good. I try to order their brussel sprouts but apparently they don't have them anymore or really disappointing. I also tried their creamed spinach was alright but was not the biggest fan of it."}
{"text":"Wow haven't had Boston market in years so when I discovered it right off providence Rd I knew I had to try it. I actually didn't even try the rotisserie chicken this time I tried the meatloaf , sweet potato casserole, and southwestern rice. I went for the meatloaf because I am a tomato based meatloaf type of girl and that's what they had. I didn't like the sauce it tasted like less quality spaghetti sauce. It was a tomato purée with onions and peppers. It may be good to some but not me. The sides were both awesome!!!! After I put ketchup on my meatloaf when I got home it definitely tasted waaaaaay better. Service was great! I also got a lemonade man oh man it was good! Parking is great and they get you in and out. Next time I'm trying the chicken. Oh remember you HAVE TO GET THE LEMONADE. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was awesome, they had this shredded barbecue chicken it was delicious, one of my favorite places to eat and take home."}
{"text":"Okay everyone. I went to Boston Market on Baum Blvd today and picked up my online order. I got back to work ready to partake in a meal.
I cut into the chicken and BLOOD not juice came out. I had two breasts both were uncooked! Both were pink inside!!! The potatoes were nasty too!
I ordered mixed veggies the gave me some broccoli with a tiny piece of carrot in it.
My lunch was ruined...
I called the store.
They told me I had to come back and bring the food to get a refund. I told them I was all the way in Bakery Square.
Manager said too bad that is our policy.
Then he tried to explain the chicken is okay to eat because all their chicken cooked on the same temperature?!?
I was so upset I went back over and did return it.
No apology
But he did credit my card.
I will NEVER go to the. Boston Market Baum Blvd again.
That meal was straight up NASTY.
Oh and btw I ordered a cookie. Someone bright put my cookie on top of the hot \"meal\" so the cookie got all squishy!
Eww
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Since the Boston Market on Washington road closed, we had to venture out to the one in green tree. I ordered the chicken pot pie which also came with cornbread. We also got some of their rotisserie chicken and sides such as sweet corn, creamy spinach, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. 

The pot pie crust was nice and flaky but the filling was just ok. Could have used some more seasoning. A plus though is they use shredded rotisserie chicken in the filling. The rotisserie chicken is always perfectly cooked and yummy. A favorite of mine since childhood. I always love their creamy spinach. Their mashed potatoes are nothing special. The sweet corn is also a great side. 

Overall, for the price the quantity and quality of food is pretty good. Can't complain 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Boston Market more these past 6-months than ever before, no particular reason.  This past experience left me tasting, well bland meatloaf.  I was very disappointed, very bland, no spices, nada zip.  Oh well, maybe I should simply stick to the chicken!!"}
{"text":"Half roasted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes. With an extra side of spicy chicken tortilla soup.

It was delicious!! The chicken was very filling and all of food was very flavorful..

Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"This location continuously doesn't have entrees on their menu available- I've came in several times for the meatloaf meal and they are out of stock.  Waste of a drive and lost a customer."}
{"text":"I better start this review before this place goes bankrupt. It doesn't even deserve a one star. I got meatloaf which I saw was already made and bot fresh. It looked ok but it tasted different that what it was before. The spinach looked like cafeteria food at a hospital and boxed mac and cheese tasted better than what they have. My son was lookinf coward to eating their famous corn bread and we got a cold white roll in replace of it because they did not have any. My daughter says that her school cafeteria food was way better than what u serve. She said she rather have that for dinner. I have not been there for many years and i am greatly dissapointwd in how it changed. It is way overpriced for what they serve. In short save ur money and go some place else"}
{"text":"I go through the drive-thru at this location about once per month. They are always super friendly, the food is great, and I've never had to call them back about missing items. BM is a little pricey, but when you compare it to a sit down restaurant you are saving money. They also have coupons on their website."}
{"text":"OK people. Let's face it. If it was called Cleveland Market, nobody would go. But throw in a trendy city's name and \"Oh, it must be fantastic.\" After all Boston does have the Celtics. And they gave us Kristin and Jared. But can they pull off fast food. Yea, kinda sorta. It's nice to have a fast food option that is a \"square meal.\" No burgers or fries. Roasted chicken, that holiday green bean casserole everyone loves but is too afraid to admit they eat it, mashed taters (gravy sucks ass though)...all pretty descent. We even tried the sirloin there, cooked medium rare, but WOW, it was like $12! So, I'm sure it's not even a Boston based company. And we all know it's nothing like a market. But three stars for dependable, un-bunned food! Oh. The cornbread? Seriously, it's \"crack\" good. I'd knock over school children just to get an extra one. As they say in Boston, \"cheers.\" I know. Lame. Now, go get some cornbread!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years there is a lady named Jenny who has been working here for over 20 years and she will take good care of you for lunch . All of the other staff is great too never had a problem with my food . Tje evening shift seemed to be slower then the day shift. Great place otherwise."}
{"text":"Drive thru service for us lazy asses. Perfect and convenient! They are efficient with my order and nice and friendly. Good is good and they have more menu options now."}
{"text":"First visit at this location - been awhile since we've been to a Boston Market. 

The not so good - the food just wasn't what it used to be.  The chicken was dry today, the bread was cold - sitting a bit. The entire meal could have used a warming to be honest. The sweet potatoes were aw some tho.  

The great - I want to congratulate the manager and staff for being one of the best run staff I've seen in a while. They were all friendly, welcoming, trying to find things to clean and check on people when no one was in line. I can't tell you how important service and the attitudes of the staff is for a business. You can always fix the food (hopefully) but cant fix poor attitudes and laziness of people. If it wasn't for the staff, the food today was likely a 1.5 star meal.. but honestly, I left so impressed with that staff that I had to rate it a 3.. 

Just hope the food gets warmer and fresher."}
{"text":"I love Boston Market too!! I seldom sit down at this location but usually get take out. Their chicken is always downright tasty and moist (I'd suggest asking for some side bbq sauce - it brings the meal to a whole other dimension!!) and I have a hard time deciding on sides. You can't go wrong with mac n cheese, vegetables, corn, stuffing and sweet potato yams. The cream spinach however seems to be different each time we order it. The cornbread while still good seems to have been reduced in thickness. I've also had the chicken pot pie and so scrumptious. Boston Market always hits the spot and service has always been peppy with no complaints."}
{"text":"okay , so i have to write this because i am so disappointed in the customer service and the presentation of my food .. i would say i am a frequent customer at this boston market and this may be the last time .. i go to boston market for the quality of food they prepare. what you will see here is mac n cheese that i ordered and i can honestly say this is the worst mac n cheese i have ever had . it tastes like my 4 month old cat started chewing on it and the regurgitated it and they threw it on my plate . that may seem extra , but in all honest this mac n cheese taste 2 weeks old minimum .. the cheese on it is hard as a rock .. in fact on the MOH's hardness scale the cheese on my mac would in my estimate calculate to at least 5.5 maybe 6 . unacceptable coming from a company like boston market."}
{"text":"It's Boston Market. Same great taste and service like the others. Quick drive thru too."}
{"text":"I think this is a great option for a fast meal that doesn't feel like fast food.  The staff have always been very wonderful when we visit - we were there for Valentines Day (we keep it pretty lowkey) and they have white tablecloths and chocolate kisses on the tables.  Their Tuscan seasoned Chicken is delicious and we always try new sides which have all been good - their squash casserole stuff was surprisingly tasty!  My boyfriend is always a sucker for their creamed spinach.  I love getting extra cornbread to warm up for breakfast the next day.
We also ordered their heat-at-home Easter meal while we watched the Game of Thrones premiere and I thought we got a great value for the package price.  The ham was delicious and all of the sides (sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, and we added macaroni and cheese) were delicious, plus we got 2 apple pies! It was a tasty feast with leftovers for everyone.
Also, when you dine during the week, you get a coupon for the upcoming Saturday for a Buy One Get One meal. I always forget to back on Saturday but I swear next time I will!"}
{"text":"Horrible take out last night. The chicken pot pie was gross mush. It went in the trash. The side of carrots were undercooked and the side of Brussel sprouts were over cooked. 
I remember Boston Market to always be on top of their game.  Not anymore."}
{"text":"Just went thru the drive thru. All I needed was some red potatoes to take to a family lunch. They told me it would be about 5 minutes. It was actually almost 10 but the manager personally walked out the potatoes to me, apologized, and gave me an order of brownies.  she said \"please take these on us and enjoy them wherever you are headed to\" AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Just okay food...i had the meatloaf sandwich...which was decent. Never being here but it failed to wow me. The girl at the register should put on smile once on a while.....great customer service goes a long way. Other than that it seem to cater to big family brunch."}
{"text":"Yikes! No butter, no wet naps, no trash bags, slippery floors.... well the welcome and exit were the best part... oh and the Hot Doughnuts Now sign that was on at Krispy Kreme across the Street!"}
{"text":"I love eating at Boston Market! The food is always delicious and I can honestly say I have never once had a bad experience, there is nothing but the best customer service given. Every time I go in, someone always checks in on our table to make sure we have everything we need and that everything is up to their highest standards."}
{"text":"I love Boston Market. The food is always good. I can always count on a varied menu with plenty of vegetables. It is definitely a break from standard fast food."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese, corn, and cornbread were good. The meatloaf was rubbery and barely edible."}
{"text":"Boston Market had not been on my radar, however, after having passed this location for years I decided to give dinner a try.  Since my first time, in years, I have been back two more times.  And, from my recent visits I find Boston Market is better than I expected.  Each time I enjoyed the Sliced Turkey dinner with two sides and a piece of cornbread.  The turkey has always been very moist and cooked to perfection.  The sides however have definitely varied. The mashed potatoes are good, but standard fast food mashed potatoes. The corn is great!  However, I wasn't too thrilled with the squash casserole, very muchy, and the sauteed veggies.  And, unfortunately the cornbread has not been consistent, one visit great, the next,stale and the final great. So, overall I have been pleased, but won't be my go to fast food spot on a regular basis.  However, if you are looking for a variety of dinner options, something quick to pick up and bring home, Boston Market might be spot to check out."}
{"text":"We had not gone here for several years. Decided to try them again since El pollo loco was not open yet. Now I remember why we stopped coming. The chickens were the size of pigeons. The sides were not fresh but maybe because we were there early evening. It was very clean but pretty empty."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Boston Market but, I was in the mood for home cooked tasting food.  The wait staff was friendly, attentive and worked well together as a team.  My order was to go and one of my items was still being cooked so I was given a cup to have any free drink while I waited (the wait was not that long).  After my fresh food was complete the manager came to me and apologized which I didn't expect then, she noticed I had ordered a brownie to split with my wife and she handed me a large container of 12 brownies!  Wow!  I am very impressed and when I got home, the food was awesome.  I hope my red potatoes are late again :)"}
{"text":"For the first time ever we pre-ordered the complete thanksgiving meal, and I was hesitant worried it would taste like pre-made cafeteria food. I must say I'm really impressed!! It was easy as ever and the turkey was juicy and tasted like the one my mom used to make. For the price and ease it was awesome and I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Great food and service! They will bring your food to your table if you dine in and the staff is very friendly especially the manager.  Be sure to try the half chicken meal and Mac and sweet potatoes.  Their buy one and get the second half off is an amazing deal."}
{"text":"As often as I eat here, I should write a review.

Look... you either like chain food place or you don't. In my opinion Boston Market is a good alternative to just any \"fast food\" joint. I feel a little healthier than eating fries and burgers (that weren't really beef). 

My go-to item is their rotisserie chicken. I normally get their kids meal, which consists of 2 pieces of dark meat (leg & thigh), 2 sides (you can request 2 sides instead of 1 side & corn bread) and a drink - all for a bargain price of under $5. Truth is no one needs to eat any more than this amount; this is a large amount of food for a kid honestly, but great for an adult.

For side items, I tend to get their sweet potato (sometimes a little too sweet - but I tell them to not scoop any of the sugar topping), garlic spinach (a better option than their creamed spinach, but I also love the creamed spinach) and the squash casserole (yes, it's cheesey and \"bready\" but that's exactly why I like them)

Keep your receipt and you get BOGO on that following Saturday."}
{"text":"Always a great value for the money. Always great food. I just wish One was closer to me as it's an hour to get there."}
{"text":"I come here every now and then since I'm in the area twice a week.  On my last visit the dining area was a little untidy.  And the service was unorganized.  Our meals are supposed to come with corn bread, but we were told they weren't ready yet and that they would bring them out to us when they were ready.  Halfway through our meals my brother checked on the corn bread and was told it still wasn't ready.  Mind you, we were not rushing through our meals since we were there mostly killing time. By the end of our meals I went up to the counter and asked if the cornbread was done.  The cashier gave me a look like I was bothering her.  (Um, the restaurant wasn't packed with people.). She said she could go to the back and get us some.  She could go back and get us some?!  Uh, didn't they say they would bring it out to us with our meal?!  Clearly, she forgot.  We're human, so no big deal.  What annoyed me was that we didn't get an apology from her and she made us feel like we were crazy for asking for the food we paid for.  Left here full, but annoyed."}
{"text":"Half chicken + creamed spinach + sweet potato casserole = my go to meal here. And it never disappoints! 
This location is always clean. The service varies but for the most part it is good and pretty fast. They have a good variety of options & everything is fresh. I love the smell of the rotisserie chickens cooking when I walk in. The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are good. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great customer service tonight! My son's meal was a little bit late, but they made it up to us in a very \"sweet\" way!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love Boston Market frozen dinners and I was so excited to try the real restaurant!! 

Visited on Sunday 8-14-16 at 12PM.  $18.57 got us two chicken dinners and one large drink.  This restaurant is located in the food court of the BX on Nellis Air Force Base. You do not need a military ID to eat here but you will need one to get on base, or ask one of your military buddies to bring you if you have one.  

The line is set up chipotle-style where you order at one end and choose what you like from the line and then pay at another end.  I got a half chicken meal which comes with two sides.  I chose macaroni and cheese and sweet potato casserole and it came with cornbread.  The rotisserie chicken was delicious.  It was hot, fresh, well seasoned, and fall-off-the-bone tender.  The sides were perfect and I especially enjoyed the cornbread which is sweet and cake-like.  

Overall the food was very good and I like it much better than the Denny's Express that was in this space previously."}
{"text":"I went there this afternoon, I tried the turkey meal.
It is good but not very fresh, it was ok though when I eat it with hot sauce.
The employees there are friendly and they smile most of the time."}
{"text":"I love Boston Market and especially the rotisserie chicken and always have! If I could I would eat it every day, but alas, the nearest BM to us is too far. I was happy though to be in the neighbourhood and enjoy their chicken and corn muffins. 
I especially liked this location cause the staff was great! They helped me get the food to the table and then cleaned the table when we were done."}
{"text":"Boston Market is a really decent fast food option.  If you're thinking about getting chicken, the salty caramelized flavor of the chicken here is the best of the fast options.  If you don't insist on fried, I'd recommend to come here.  The sides are pretty good, but the healthy side options are pretty limited.  If you stick to chicken breast or turkey with green beans or fresh veggies, you can get away with an appropriately sided lunch.  They also use real (kinda real) stainless utensils and plates.  For fast food, its a nice touch since they clean up after you too.

I would probably rate most Boston Markets as a 3 star, but the staff here is extra friendly!"}
{"text":"I've actually never dined at Boston Market until a few weeks ago. I always have seen it in my hometown but, it shut down before I had the chance to try it. This Boston Market was pretty packed the first time I tried it for lunch. I ordered a white chicken meat meal with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Meals come with a choice of bread roll or cornbread. Doesn't sound like a lot.. Wrong! Our plates were filled to the brim with food. I couldn't even finish half! The sides were amazing and the chicken was super fresh. The chipotle sauce was a nice finish to the chicken, sweet and spicy! We got lucky finding a table, it was the last open one during the lunch rush. 

My second experience was a takeaway dinner, less packed but still had some people in line. You could tell the sides were a little drier than at lunch, I'm assuming less turn over during the later hours. Still tasted great and was affordable for the cliched broke ass med student. Again, containers were packed with food. 

My suggestion, order takeout during lunch. The food is fresh and you don't have to worry about fighting for table!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I've been to this Boston market a few times and haven't had a complaint! I love the rotisserie chicken. Although I've had the meatloaf and turkey and both were good. They replenish the sides frequently and you'll always get the freshest made they have."}
{"text":"My coworker and I opted to deviate from our usual lunch spots and get something from Boston Market.  It's been a while since I've been to Boston Market, but I was familiar with their offerings and already knew what I wanted to get.  I ordered the Three-Piece Dark combo with mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese.  We got our soft drinks while we waited for food to be prepared.  Our orders were prepared within a reasonable time and we were on our way.  I had to double check my order to make sure that I got what I had ordered.  Upon inspection, I saw a sorry excuse for a Three-Piece Dark chicken meal.  The chicken pieces looked like they were from pigeons.  The side order of mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese dwarfed the serving of chicken.  We were well on our way back to work, so we stopped at Burger King to get a burger because I was certain that the \"Three-Piece Dark\" meal was not going to leave me feeling very satiated.  C'mon, Boston Market.  I could have gone to a local grocery store and bought a whole rotisserie chicken and received a better value than this.  If this is the new norm for serving size for rotisserie chicken, I will no longer be a patron at your establishments."}
{"text":"Always greet you when you arrive, fill order quickly and suggest treating yourself to a dessert. Great service and food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Comfort food... Basic down-home dinner. :-) sometimes ya just gotta."}
{"text":"The food, as always, is excellent.  So is the service.  HOWEVER, if you plan on using their advertised \"free Wi-Fi\" service, better go somewhere else. I've tried it several times, and it has never worked well."}
{"text":"Over time this has been my fall back for grabbing reasonably \"healthy\" drive-thru food when I don't feel like fixing myself up enough to get out of my car. (Enough said about that...)  I find myself now, when I order my food - adding \"and can you please make sure it's hot, the last time it was barely warm\".  All three times I went this month, parts of my order were barely warm.  It has happened with meatloaf twice, and soup once.  Other items in my order are hot.

I know it isn't the three mile drive home during which it cools off.  And why would those items cool faster than the other hot items in my order.  

That said, service is friendly, food is consistent, and the food options beat drive-thru burgers and fries any day."}
{"text":"Back in the day, Boston Market was sooooo yummy. Today it's just alright. Their rotisserie chicken is WAY better than the grocery store chix and their mashed potatoes must be super bad for you because they taste so dang good. But it's just not as good as it used to be before it was bought out. Still, my kids love the chicken. It's good for a family meal when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Call it amnesia, but whenever I venture out this way, I always forget there's a Boston Market here. Every time I see it, I get excited and insist on stopping. 

What it is about Boston Market? They exist all over the country, and is the typical rotisserie chicken chain but yet, I can't get enough. Nothing special, the foods always kinda mediocre and so are the sides. 

It must be the fact that I only eat it once every few months that keeps it kickin' on taste buds. I'm also a sucker for roasted chicken and any place that serves turkey not on Thanksgiving. American comfort food for the Asian kid. Cheers to mashed potatoes and stuffing!"}
{"text":"Their bogo coupons are great. Usually on receipts when buying weekdays, then coupon good for Saturday.

Best to not use order or app. Rarely are the orders even started before promised ready time. About 15% success rate."}
{"text":"Usually I really like Boston market. I like ribs also, so tried with chicken and meal. The ribs weren't very tasty. It had almost no flavor. I know the food is prepared ahead of time but these didnt seem fresh. Everything else was good as usual but I say stay away from the ribs."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service!!!! Food is nothing to rave about. Came in on my lunch break from work, from walking in to eating was 15 minutes. When I arrived the line had only one person that was being helped. My order was taken and before it could be finished the employee stopped helping me and attended to another customer who arrived after me for a pick up. Then my order was then finished by another employee who walked in from the back. After being rung up. I was told to have a seat I then waited until several other people were rung up for the food to be brought to the table without silverware. Very inefficient setup up employees obviously have no table service experience and while this was all going on the manager was chatting with a customer.
Looks like jack in the box will be my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"3rd bad visit IN A ROW to this location!!!
1st time was rudely told meatloaf wait was at least 1 hour
2nd time- counter staff was rude
3rd time- music was so loud we could not have a conversation at our table AND the same counter  person as 2nd visit was arguing with a co-worker/manager
While 10 people waited in line behind me.
Counter person told the manager \"then send me home\" so all  the waiting customers could hear . 
Staff seems very unprofessionally and inexperienced ie:  people need silverware to eat... you have to ask for it, order soup-ask for a soup spoon."}
{"text":"One of the better \"fast\" food expierences.  You can usually get in and out of this location pretty quickly.  I love me some home cookin!  Or at least as close as you can get from a chain..."}
{"text":"I have been to several Boston Market locations and this one is my favorite. The lobby is always clean and the staff is friendly. Prices can be a bit high on some items but worth the money if you want a good homestyle cooked meal without doing all the work."}
{"text":"Boston Market used to be on McKnight Road until it was closed down. I LOVE the pot pie here. This Boston Market in particular changed a whole lot. They made the inside roomier and it's like a traditional restaurant but without the waiter/waitress service. You still have the choice to take out or sit in. I give this place a 4 star because it is modern and the food is still great  in my eyes. Keep up the great work and hopefully this location will not close down."}
{"text":"Ah, Boston Market, how I've missed you.

Years ago all the Boston Markets in the PNW went away and I've missed their delicious chicken ever since. When I saw one a mile or two down the road from our hotel in Scottsdale it was on!

The chicken was just as good as I remember it: tender, juicy, flavorful. We got the family meal of a whole roasted chicken, three sides, and three cornbreads. Never been much of a cornbread fan, but this was actually pretty good. For sides we got the loaded baked potatoes (really good and just as health-conscious as they sound :p), corn, and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese wasn't nearly as good as I remember it being and was actually pretty lousy. Don't know if that's a change in the product, faulty memory on my part, or if it never really was any good.

Price was pretty good (around $28) and everyone was very polite and helpful; unusual for the fast food market they're definitely a part of. 

I'm glad I got to scratch that particular itch; now I can stop whining about them leaving the area, at least for a while : )"}
