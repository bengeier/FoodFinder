{"text":"We have been doing tastings for our wedding and did one with Mitch's on Monday. The food was soooo good. We are sending in our deposit today and can't wait to have the food for our wedding!"}
{"text":"I attended an event catered by Mitch's at the Veterans Pavilion in Schenley Park last night.  I arrived an hour and a half late due to circumstances beyond my control at work, but there was still plenty of food when I arrived.  I had a BBQ pork sandwich and some chicken with baked beans, corn on the cob, pasta salad, and green salad.  The BBQ pork was pretty good, although not the best I've ever had.  It was very tender, but the texture was a bit strange (there seemed to be chunks of pork intermingled with the pulled sections, whereas I'm accustomed to pure pulled pork), and it was slightly spicy (this is weird, since I've never had spicy pulled pork before).  The chicken was okay, but nothing to really write home about.  The baked beans weren't as sweet as I'm accustomed to.  I didn't have any issues with the corn, pasta salad, or green salad, but it's hard to mess these items up.  I liked the array of items offered for the dinner buffet, and I appreciated that they were labeled so I didn't have to guess about what things were.  The one criticism I have of the layout is that the corn on the cob was in a cooler beside the buffet table (I assume this was done in order to keep it warm and to save space), and I would have missed it had I not asked someone where it was (I saw the butter for the corn on the condiment table, which tipped me off that there was corn to be had).  This would probably be a 3.5 star review if it weren't for the ice cream sundae bar.  After dinner, they set up a table with four tubs of ice cream, and you could choose one or two flavors, which they'd scoop into a bowl for you.  (I chose oreo and chocolate.)  You then could take your ice cream to another table filled with sundae condiments, and dress it with as many as you like.  I went pretty crazy, taking some of all of the following: hot fudge, rainbow sprinkles, crushed Reese cups, crushed brownies (?), whipped cream, and maraschino cherries.  Needless to say, all of this made for one killer sundae!  As for the ice cream itself, it was quite smooth and delicious--definitely the culinary highlight of the meal.  Given that I didn't work with them to prepare for this event, I can't comment on that aspect of the experience.  However, as a consumer, I was pretty pleased with their offerings, and would enjoy attending another event catered by them."}
{"text":"We have used Mitch's Barbecue for many of our family functions and occasions. I have recommend Mitch to many of our friends, who have also used him for picnics and graduations. Mitch and his wife are wonderful to deal with, friendly and accommodating to all my special food needs. He has always been on time and followed all the venues requirements. The food is Excellent!!. The staff the Mitch hires are friendly and helpful.   We have always ordered The Backyard Bar-B-Que ( boneless chicken, hamburgers and hot dogs and a choice of two of his sides, usually the pasta and coleslaw, and we have always loved the homemade Ice Cream bar. )  We have also added the Pork BBQ at an additional price, but it was so well worth it !!  call him for your next event, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ!  People say that we don't have great traditional BBQ here in Pittsburgh, well now we do! My family & I have been to their new restaurant location on Perry Hwy in Warrendale a couple of times now, and I can tell you that you'll want to stop in and try some of their delicious BBQ. (They cater too!)  Enjoyed their tasty Ribs, and the Beef Brisket is juicy, tender, and tasty!  So good it melts in your mouth!  We also tried their Pulled Pork Sandwiches and they were very good. I do wish they had a few more sauce options to try.  Our sides of Cilantro Lime Cole Slaw was really good, never had it this good before.  They do offer a traditional creamy Cole Slaw as well, but we love this other version! They have a good Mac & Cheese too.  Great location, clean and well kept with plenty of tables inside and out back in a nice porch setting.  For dessert we tried their Maple & Vanilla homemade ice cream and it was excellent!  Do yourself a favor and stop off at Mitch's soon to see what I mean about great BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich from the Mitch's in Warrendale. It was just the right amount of barbecue sauce, tho they gave you more on the side.  The sandwich was a big size, taste delicious and just right for lunch.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch today... ribs, BBQ pork sandwich, BBQ beans. The BBQ sauce is a bit tangy (too \"ketchup-y\" for me) so asked for a side of the Texas fire sauce and it made all the difference. Great food, great price."}
{"text":"Good and I will go back!  Neat place, great service!  I ordered the ramen and I wouldn't get it again.  The nori was way overpowering and the bok choy was undercooked and bitter.  However, I tried both my friends meals...brisket tacos and a hot chicken sandwich...and both were amazing!!    And the piece de resistance....Meyer Lemon ice cream!!!  I'll go back for that!!!  And to give it another chance."}
