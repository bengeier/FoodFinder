{"text":"Great food, fast service, nice happy hour selection. We love that it's loud enough that we don't have to worry about bringing our toddler."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Really hope it doesn't go out of business. Definitely a \"hidden\" gem. Great service. Met the GM - he was super friendly and welcoming. Our server was upbeat, pleasant and answered all of our questions. They have an amazing happy hour. Half off apps and great drink specials. Their house margarita (on the rocks with salt) is deceivingly strong and delicious. They have the only tequila tap in the United States!!Their apps are awesome. The wild mushroom tamale is ridiculous. Highly recommend. The ceviche is amazing especially if you're a fan of lime. And their carne asada plates are impressive. Basically if you're looking for some gourmet Mexican food (I know that sounds lame, but it's true) and some great drinks, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Love this place!   We had the enchiladas with steak    The guacamole was yummy too.  This is now my favorite Mexican resturant!!!"}
{"text":"The theme of this restaurant is confusing. It doesn't feel like a Mexican restaurant at all. The food was typical Americanized Mexican food. I ordered a caipirinha and it was way to sweet. The service was a little slow but the food was good. Nothing was really that special"}
{"text":"I just heard TQLA closed today and what a tragedy! I have been a \"regular\" there since the restaurant opened and I just want to go on record as saying in my opinion this was a management problem! Staff members came and went, if they weren't professional, customer oriented and team players they didn't stay long! Over the years I made a lot of friends of both staff and management! Managements philosophy seem to be that there job was to give direction to staff and interact with customers to make sure the customers experience was a positive one! I think this was proven by the fact of the number of regulars you would encounter on any given night, especially Thurs, Fri, Sat and Sunday. A group of us use would come in on Sunday, for \"Sunday Funday\"!  Recently, they went through some management and staff changes, and in my opinion some mistakes were made, while some deserving staff were promoted, seemed more like they were just given more duties! Every time I asked where the new manager was, was told they were gone. I never met any of the new management, was never engaged nor observed them engaging other customer!  I know from experience that the restaurant business is the hardest business to make a go in and that this time of year is doubly difficult because it is our off-season! I suggest that the failure of this establishment has more to do with the leadership or lack of, then with anything else!  I am going to seriously miss all the fine people I met both customers and staff!"}
{"text":"Went there for Happy Hour. Everything was very good - Drinks -  Food - Service.  The group of friends & I will be back."}
{"text":"Good place for Happy Hour.  If you are lucky, Holly will be your server.  Excellent job.  Food & drinks good too.  We'll sure be back. Ken"}
{"text":"best customer service, best happy hour! i absolutely love this place!  the food is excellent, drinks are perfect! i usually order the micheloda, today i tried a Margarita! :) it was delicious! you can sit outside or outside inside! :) doors are open but the AC is blazing. the atmosphere is beautiful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Does admitting to the fact that we went to this place twice in one day tell you anything?  The Carne Asada ... blew my mind. It was a 8 oz (ish) piece of meat that was cooked to my liking. I have not had meat that tender and flavorful, maybe ever? The bartender John made a drink pairing selection, a Habanero infused Blackberry Margarita... kinda made you want to smack people! Then the bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer with grilled veggies.. another home run. These were big shrimp skewered with Jalapeno spears and acrispy bacon shell. This was lunch and dinner!!"}
{"text":"I went to TQLA around this time last year and I remembered it to be a fun atmosphere, and pretty good food.  This past weekend, my friends were in from Boston, and were asking for some good mexican food and drinks. I took them to TQLA thinking they'd enjoy it, but much to my surprise, the food, staff, and overall vibe had changed, and my friends didnt seem pleased with the food or service.  I ended up having to defend myself, letting them know I had only tried it once before, and it seemed to be a nice place.  The biggest complaint was when our server suggested the fajitas, and when we ordered them, she brought out a completely different order, and when we noticed it, she seemed upset and made a comment to the effect of we must have forgotten what we ordered.   She ended up changing it, but it took a while, and she seemed annoyed or bothered by us.  Unfortunately, I wont be returning to TQLA.  If someone wants good mexican food or drinks in the Phoenix area, I'd suggest Barrios downtown.  Its a bit of a drive, but the service and food are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with wifey.  In summary:  Value just not realized.  Sat outside with heaters and Christmas music which was the highlight of the visit.  Food and drink way over priced.  For a place with the name of TQLA, I would hope to taste it in the $10 margaritas.  We will be back for a happy hour....maybe.  never again for dinner.  Pass."}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight and it was AWESOME!! I will for sure be going back. The fajitas are amazing, the best I have ever had. The service was good and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"Very good food! Great atmosphere and people.  Wish we had a place like this closer to us!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delicious food, and perfect margaritas! What more could you ask for? Oh, maybe an extensive menu of tequila and cocktails, including tequila on tap? Yep well, they have that too! We have been back in AZ for 2 days after living in HI for 3 years, and of course have been eating nothing but all the Mexican food we can get our hands on! We were headed to our go-to place, Serrano's...and I am so glad they are closed on Sundays because that forced us to drive a little farther north and find this gem! Had the tres amigos for an appetizer and it went perfectly with our \"margarita flights\", the three margarita sampler where you choose three of their many fruity flavors (the three together were enough to get me a bit buzzed and my mom just barely drunk). We also got the grilled fish tacos and steak enchiladas, and both were amazing. The fajitas that passed by our table were mouth-watering, even though we were already SO full! Ryan was our waiter and was super attentive and friendly! He mentioned they have been open almost a year and miiiiiiiiight be having a huge party when they hit the year mark...well we will DEFINITELY be there! As this particular building location has a terrible track record of businesses failing, I am praying that TQLA makes it and is open for many years to come!"}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. Just stopped there for happy hr. Sign on door says - building landlord took over for nonpayment of rent.  Too bad. We were looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Me and my Wife loved it! Went for Cinco De Mayo and had great drinks and food? Sat at the bar and had great service! We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great ceviche and crab cakes! We just moved to the neighborhood and will be back often!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Saturday night.  We sat inside and we loved the environment.  The chips were thin and delicious and the green and (fire roasted) red salsas were both very good.  We had the Carne Asada and the chicken and steak Fajitas.  They were both fabulous along with the beans and rice.  We also had an on-tap IPA and the Flirtini, both of which were quite good.  The price was reasonable and the service was great.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always find a reason to get together their with friends or family..The sitting area outside is my favorite, especially happy hour...:) great prices, DELICIOUS food, their salsas are so yummy and on Fridays they have live music... Totally recommend this restaurant to everyone and if its Friday you get it all! You will not be disappointed at all:) Enjoy everyone!"}
{"text":"Its a cheap version of tgi fridays and the place is dry, not friendly and the food sucks!"}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin crusted salmon dish.  It was so delicious!  Bursting with flavor and the right amount of food.    It's a little pricey at almost $20 but so worth it if you want to try it.  The ceviche was very good and tasted so fresh.  Carne asada and fish tacos were a big hit at our table.  The Sangria was also a plus!  I'm a big sangria lover and the house made Sangria was fruity and had the right flavors.  It's worth the 6.75 a glass...  Glad we came out to eat here and I'm sure we will be back!!!   I'm a new fan!"}
{"text":"They have  the best   pineapple blueberry infused tequila to die for. This place rock I will totally be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food here is good. I love the atmosphere. Their margaritas are the best I've ever had. My gripe is that I've been here several times, held several celebrations here, and I just came here to celebrate my birthday and I barely even got a \"Happy Birthday\" from my lackluster wait person. Really? I could have chosen a dozen other places but came here because I love the food and they don't go out of their way to make me feel special?   Very upset. Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"What a great place love the Tequila on Tap ..Food was Great and Gabi r waitress was as sweet as can be ....cant wait to go back ..  O the Craw fish hush puppies da bomb ...Skirt Steak ..Deeelish ..!!! :)"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this gem and have been 6 times in just a couple of weeks. Absolutely love it!  Food has an incredible mix of flavors and stands out from the crowd of traditional southwest restaurants!   The service is outstanding. Went with friends on Cinco de Mayo and our waiter Kimball had so much to teach us about their tequila flights. Was truly a great experience. Took mom for Mother's day brunch and Elsie gave us superb attention.  Highly recommend the carne asada and wild mushroom tamale - both are an explosion of flavor! The salsas are fabulous as well. This is a new fave for sure and will be a regular visit!"}
{"text":"My family took me to this place for Father's Day. I had the worst experience ever!!! they served us raw  potatoes, COMPLETELY RAW!! On top of it when we made the comment to the manager he started arguing and telling us that we took it 'too personal'. Not only they RUINED the meal, but destroyed what was intended to be a memorable experience with the family.  I'll never go back! Beware!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place, it was hard to come check it out with Costa Vida so close and so good. But from now on, when we have the money, this is the new place to go!  The food was very delicious (I had the carnitas tacos), the complimentary chips and salsa were also great, and the chips didn't seem gross and greasy like most other complimentary chips (think Chili's). Tried two margaritas, they were very strong and worth the happy hour price. Our server Lyndsey was very nice and she wasn't at all annoyed that we were the only people to be sitting outside in the heat, making her come outside to check on us every time.   Only down side is the menu seemed kinda pricey unless you're here for happy hour. But the food is high enough quality to be worth the high price!"}
{"text":"I got my months worth of going out to this establishment! It should be called TQAZ . Shots on tap and they put the app in happy hour!"}
{"text":"Good food, a little pricey for good food. nice atmosphere. good place for a date or to start out a 21st birthday if you got some money to burn."}
{"text":"Six of us went in for drinks and some late night snacking. We ordered some nachos and they brought complimentary chips and salsa. This was my first time here since re-opening as TQLA.   The first round of drinks was a mess. The server could not get anything right. My beer was wrong TWICE! The bartender apparently mixed the wrong alcohols into two of my friends drinks. The server did not really do a great job of trying to fix the situation. He instead tried to say we were wrong and that the tequila they tasted was in the right drink. That drink was supposed to have mint leaves yet the other drink which didn't have tequila had mint leaves. Wow. Good job buddy. This guy couldn't even remember the four tequilas they had that were infused.   By the way. The infused tequilas are awful. Everyone that tried the vanilla and hibiscus/mint almost vomited. For a bar that names themselves tequila it was a poor showing.   The only bright point was the chips, salsa, and nachos. All were fantastic. I would not recommend this place for drinks or the service. It was awful. Now the food was actually pretty good.   Overall I think this building is cursed because the last restaurant that was here closed and this one probably should as well."}
{"text":"We went today for Mothers day and wow the food and service was the worst experience ever ! People around our table were waiting for a hour for food ! Half the food came out and was wrong  and we sent it back ! It came out with the rest 20 minutes later cold and the steak and Eggs were seriously cold!  Worst Service ever - Server never asked us if we wanted another drink or refilled our water glasses or our kids glasses ! Love the atmosphere but would rather eat brunch at Dennys !"}
{"text":"TQLA is my Joint!! I LOVE this place. Jason is my bartender and he's beyond Rad! Brad is my main manager and he is cooler than cool !!!  The food is fantastic (especially when you add jalapeños to Anything...) Infused tequilas like Blackberry habanero, pineapple blueberry, mixed berry, Etc....Etc.... The possibilities are Endless  Get Here Now !!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak and carnitas fajitas, strong margaritas, and bomb salsa!  If the salsa sucks I won't go back, and the warm salsa here is fantastic.  No way this place is 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"To the point - TQLA in the Dana Park Plaza off Val Vista has T  H  E   \"BEST\" steak fajitas in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"The house margaritas are delicious! We love the salsa as well. I wish they had a separate fryer for chips since I have Celiac:( but I bring my own. I love the fajitas and shrimp tacos. Both gf(chicken fajitas only)  the live music is fun as well!!"}
{"text":"Combine horrible service with frightening management!  Food is decent but service is nothing but a disappointment.  Every time we go we can expect a 15 minute wait to order food and don't even think about a drink refill.  Overpriced!  Rude staff all the way up to management."}
{"text":"I called about 5 minutes before we arrived to see how long of a wait they had. She said there was no wait (on a Friday night? Cool). So we get there, we're the only ones in the entrance and she says it would be 30 minutes. I was not happy about this, so I told her I JUST called and she said, \"Oh... wait, we do have a table actually.\" Hmm... that was rude.   The salsas were delicious; some of the best I've had -- chips were nothing special. I got the chicken quesadilla and it came out cold and soggy, and my husband got crawfish and spinach enchiladas, which he loved. I think the kitchen prepared my quesadilla ahead of time because it was under the \"Appetizers\" category and so it sat under the heat lamp until my husband's was done. It was cold and wet and very bland. I would not get this again. My husbands crawfish enchiladas were $14 and a very, very small portion. Two thin, under-stuffed echiladas with over-cooked rice and black beans. But he enjoyed the flavor so that was good.  I would definitely give it another shot and sample their tequilas/margaritas and chow down that delicious black bean salsa and tomatillo-pineapple salsa; it's about time a restaurant isn't scared to offer some spiciness in their salsa (currently pregnant so I couldn't try the alcohol). I like the atmosphere; it's just what Gilbert/Mesa needs. It's hip and young, with cool decor."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for the queso blanco and ceviche during happy hour.  Recently, the happy hour menu changed and  there  is no longer half off apps and the queso recipe has changed for the worse.  It used to be unique and flavorful.  It is now bland and tastes like something out of a jar.   So disappointing.  The servers here are not very attentive.  However, If you sit at the bar, Jason and Kevin will take great care of you.   So bummed I had to change my initial review from last year, but the recent changes are no good."}
{"text":"Sh!t service. Sat for 10 mins without being asked by any of the staff if we'd like some water, while 3 others behind us were sat and already served drinks. The manager pouring a drink behind the bar in a brandy glass readying it to be served to another customer, made it a point to gock/comment about my girlfriends hummingbird tattoo as we made our exodus out the front door."}
{"text":"Good happy hour and a great server today. Had slow service in the past but great today!"}
{"text":"hard to give this restaurant 3 stars because the food is absolutely wonderful. today however we had the worst experience possible at a restaurant. there were 6 of us on a sunday afternoon at 3. our waitress must have been having a really bad day. after the meal SHE OFFERED to split the ticket(we did not ask) so sure since you asked and some of the people were drinking, yes by all means. she brought back 3 WRONG tickets!!!!! she re-did them...........again, wrong. she's charging people for beer they didn't order, adding soda to the bill, charged my bill 3 times for the wrong order!!!(we were not the drinkers). i told the woman 4 times that i didn't order the carnitas.......still ended up paying for them. no managers in sight to ask how things were, because i was ready to tell them. if she couldn't split the ticket......she shouldn't have OFFERED because we wouldn't have asked. we brought 4 new people to the restaurant who i am sure will never go back based purely on service. so 3 stars is not enough for the food (chips and salsa to die for) but 3 stars for this waitress is 2 1/2 too many."}
{"text":"TQLA, has greatly improved from when they first opened. I have been twice in the last week (once for Happy Hour and once for Brunch). The margarita flights are amazing! Also, Sunday brunch is a great addition! The Bloody Mary bar is amazing ( beware the spicy is very spicy but delicious) the breakfast food was very good as well, perfect after a Saturday night out."}
{"text":"The salsa and chips were good, but stay away from the cerviche. Got food poisoning...service was good."}
{"text":"I'd go again !  Been there twice and look forward to a third time. Good food both times.  Tacos and fajitas are worthy repeats as are the burritos !  Give it a try when you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Impressed on all fronts. A word of warning though: if you don't booze or meat, don't bother. If you like at least one of the two, you'll leave happy.  The decor is clean, hip, sophisticated, and minimalistic with enough of a rustic feel to remind you of the state you're in and the kind of food you're eating. The service was great - I apologized to my waiter for needing my water glass refilled constantly, since I don't tolerate spicy food all that well, and he brought me an extra glass. Nice touch. The menu is roughly half alcohol (remember my warning earlier? I wasn't kidding) but the food items are all appetizing (with, at most, three vegetarian options, so leave your veggie friends at home). Perhaps best of all, the portions are all reasonably-sized (and reasonably priced for the quality), so I was able to share an appetizer and a dessert while having plenty of room for my entree. I had the queso blanco, the crawfish enchiladas, and the triple chocolate brownie - all excellently prepared and fresh-tasting. I got a side of mac and cheese to take home and I have no doubts it will make an awesome dinner tomorrow night. And I really was impressed by everything - in the ladies' room, the trash can was placed next to the door (so you can use your paper towel to open the door instead of your clean hands... for those of you who aren't obsessive about that sort of thing) as well as a hand sanitizer dispenser. The germaphobe in me was overjoyed.  Definitely looking forward to coming back, I hope I can make it in for brunch sometime because the menu looks wonderful."}
{"text":"Look. If you like cilantro, and I mean REALLY like cilantro the this is the place for you. I hate cilantro and apparently it comes on everything and in everything. I felt the food was pricey yet mediocre. The Bloody Mary bar may be something I look into after I have eaten somewhere else. Like Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Brought family here from out of town because we really loved our first experience. 2nd time, will never come back. Worst service I have ever experienced. Food/drinks/overall horrible."}
{"text":"Everything disgusting from the margarita of the month (chile mango) to the nachos with complimentary fingernails. Just say no!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and ambience. Tequila is top notch. Food leaves much to be desired. Fajitas are good. Sides are awful as is the black beans, rice, and others. Ceviche is poor. They try to be gourmet with dishes unsuccessfully. Just step back and try delicious instead. Service can be very poor at times. Even during  slow periods of time."}
{"text":"Very average. Nothing special. Had issues with all our 8 orders coming out at once and a few of our meals we not prepared accurately. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went to TQLA for my first time for lunch on a Friday with a client and sat in the bar at a high-top.. It was slower than I had hoped for, for TQLA. So everyone that try's this place, please write a review to help support them. The food was SO very good. The guacamole kart (where they make it in front of you) was fantastic!! I had the wedge salad with chicken, would get it again. The service was amazing....I don't how many times someone would pass by to make sure we were happy. Everyone from the manager, server and I think even another waiter or the bus person. I hear they get a crowd for the evenings because of the open patio that they are due to get misters soon for the summer evenings. Please support this place, it's a great upper scale bar/restaurant and this area really needs a fun and unique venue such as TQLA. The menu offers American and Mexican style food. When you go, ask for Lyndsey as your server....she was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I went in for the first time and my server was very attentive. I asked her what her favorite appetizer was and she said the calamari so I ordered it, as I was already contemplating getting it. I absolutely loved it, I'm a huge calamari fan and can I just say it's hard to find good calamari. So glad I checked this place out, the atmosphere was great and the service was on point. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"LOVE THE HAPPY HOUR.  My friend and I went for happy hour on a Friday night and the place was packed but we still managed to get seats at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere had a very modern vibe.  The ceviche was out of this world and was only $5 !!!!!!! It had big chunks of fish along with scallops and shrimp.  Best ceviche in the valley and it was ridiculously inexpensive.  Our entire bill was 15 and we had 2 margaritas, ceviche and guacamole with chips and salsa. The quacamole was off the charts too.  The margarita was refreshing and delicious as well.  I wished they had one in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials and nice ambiance. Very warm, welcoming service. Good selection of drinks and the food was pretty good. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Great flavors and fab margaritas, finally!  The hunny and I stopped in in a Saturday night around 8:30 pm.  There was plenty of open parking.  Tqla is located one light south of the 60.  The entrance is very nice, facing Val vista with 2 oversize doors.  We sit in a booth, only 1 large group nearing the end of thier meal with 3 small children.  We ask to sit one booth over which they obliged.   We started with a passion tea for him and a Chambord Rita for me and guacamole.  The Rita was great, swirled Chambord into the frozen house which did have a nice bite.  The guacamole was a large portion but the avocado was not quite ripe.  The house salsas are very good, one yummy Limey green and a hot smoky deep red thin sauce.  For our entrees we got the steak quesadilla and the carnitas tacos.  As for the carnitas, it was tender but most likely slow cooked.  To me it was more of a red chili pork not a true carnitas that's shredded and crisped.  The steak quesadilla was awesome with yummy cheese and all sorts of flavors.    We were full and did not try dessert. Nice and accommodating service at this New Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Combo Margarita Sampler is a great idea.  You can sample 3 different margaritas at a time.  The Oyster  appetizer was fishy and that means it's not fresh, it was bad. I won't get that again.  The Carne Asada meal was delicious. I made the mistake of getting it medium rare. It should be medium well. I don't even know why they ask you, it's not steak. I will probably come back for HH to try more..."}
{"text":"TQLA Is Bomb. I Mean Look At The Name. It Says It All!!! Make Sure You Have A DD! Money For Your Tequila & A Proper TIP! I Mean It Is \"Too Insure Proper Service\""}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the wild mushroom tamale was amazing however when I ask what was their specialty I was told the fajitas. The steak was mediocre at best and had a bizarre flavor. The shrimp was dry and the side of rice and beans did not complement the flavors and was hard and under cooked. It was warm, not hot. It should be improved or dropped from their menu as it offered no motivation for me to return. This is NOT their best item by far and could have the same item at a ghetto chills."}
{"text":"I was visiting my niece and her finance and decided to try out TQLA and happy that we did. Our server was super friendly and out dinner was very tasty. As we left, the manager Joe thanked us for coming in and definitely looking forward to a second visit."}
{"text":"Don't even like the house Margaritas any more. The bartender told me they changed ownership/management very quickly THREE TIMES. Was with a friend the other day in the area and we passed on TQLA because...their food is lousy now too.  Really a shame. If they were on the stock market...I'd short this one. They will go under. Sad. Nice space."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Satirday night to check it out. The ambiance was really nice and the live music was nice - a little too loud but it was solid. The waiter was on point answering our questions and the tres amigos was a great appetizer choice. The red sangria was nice and sweet and the ultimate tequila was awesome! Unfortunately, the place is a little too pricey for being what it is - a tex mex bar and sports lounge. Nonetheless, we were pretty satisfied. Next time, I'm getting that Cuatro Leches."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Tqla for an early dinner this afternoon. We had the fajitas and the Chile rellano and they were both amazing. I give it 4 stars because the service was pretty bad. After taking our drink order we had a long wait for chips and the waitress forgot the salsa. After that the waitress continued to chat at the bar while we were trying to get her attention but we were ignored. With our food order we asked for an appetizer,which we never got and we never were offered chip refills. Overall very disappointing service wise."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we have been here but tonight we were celebrating the awesomeness of my husband! Our waiter Justin ROCKED and we had  the steak Fajitas for 2 again and I think they were even better this time than the last time. I am now forever spoiled for fajitas. the meat was sooooooo tender and flavorful, I could have had just that and been happy. then to our surprise Elsie our waitress from our first visit 3 years ago came over and REMEMBERED US AND WHAT WE ORDERED!!! She is now almost done with hospitality school and LOVES working here!!!  And it shows. She is no longer a waitress and I am not sure of her title, but she ROCKS TOO!  We had an amazing night and we decided we need to come back more often."}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience!!  Everything. The server, Tony, was so helpful as we tried to select not a huge portion for the two of us. The taco platters come with three tacos!!  The fried fish tacos were the best ever!!  Better than La Bufadora, Mexico and that's saying something. Nice shot of Patron from a TAP like beer. I wish they had these in SF Bay Area. And then the live band has to go and play Billy Joel \"You May Be Right...I may be Crazy\". So fun"}
{"text":"So far, so GOOD!  For the first experience, I have to say, very good. I will return! The tomatillo salsa, a little too limey, but the roasted red pepper salsa was good. Chips were light and tasty. Waitress was so nice and attentive. Guess they've only been open for 3 weeks, but nice start. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is comfort food to us and that is exactly what we have experienced at TQLA.  We have visited TQLA 4 times and at this point must share with you how wonderful (and not so) wonderful dishes we have had.  Front of the house service has always been exceptional.  Clean kitchen and bathrooms (necessary that I check this out before dining).  Always start with an Original Frozen Margarita, devour chips served with their outstanding tomatillo and warm fire roasted red salsa, then move on to a little bowl of Queso Blanco...this is not the Velvetta deal....it is the real deal with Mexican cheeses.  Fajitas Famosa (chicken)...The Best Fajitas in Town!  $16.00 for one (little steep) or $23.00 for two...a good deal!  Plenty of meat, sides and tortillas.  Little side of chipotle butter adds a different twist to fajitas.  Appetizers~Spicy Crab Cakes were below average.  Not crispy and on the fishy side...would not order again.  On the other hand, the chicken quesadillas were much better than we have had in quite some time...the difference...they were not greasy and were actually filled with a substantial amount of grilled chicken.  Today...had a lunch combo special...one enchilada and one chalupa with beans and rice...very satisfying.  TQLA knows how to properly build layers of flavors that are authentic Mexican!"}
{"text":"The food is alright, but the service is always great! This is a fine venue for a quality tequila education. Think outside the Patron!"}
{"text":"Tqla is nice enough. We started an evening here. Reservation was a breeze and all that, however we came early for just a drink and we didn't realize that only the bar is open seating. All others high tops and whatnots are not. So we waited for that and got a grand seat in front of the enthusiastic pro-karaoke man that welted out Margaritaville like he was getting paid by the decibel. He might be ju fine entertainment for some people, but I am less amused. Especially since it makes you eat in silence while making awkward eye contact with your friends.  Overall it is an ok place, but I had heard more about this place than it delivered and post-visit I concluded that it must be the lack of competition that fills this place at 5pm on Good Friday. monopoly at its finest is a sweet business aspect. I respect that, but as I said I expected more.   The waitress staff was sweet and accommodating and that goes some way too.  I still haven't made my mind up about this place. I realize that I will come back when in this neck of the woods. But it will probably not be MY suggestion."}
{"text":"Just left TQLA. I'm pretty Impressed actually.   The food was really good!   I had the carnitas tacos with black beans and rice.- the carnitas meat was absolutely delicious. The rice was perfectly seasoned Mexican rice and the black beans were cooked just rice with small dap of creme fresh and white Mexican cheese. The meal itself was plenty for me. Two tacos with a side of rice and beans. I was defiantly stuffed after. ~ $10.95  A couple other people had the crispy lunch chicken tacos- a little extra something than your normal chicken tacos. Also included rice and beans. ~ $9.95  Another had the chorizo and eggs (Sunday brunch special) I stole a bite and it was fabulous!! Chorizo and cilantro on top of an egg with a side of seasoned breakfast potatoes. I'd defiantly be back just for this! ($8.95)  The cocktails were also great! They have a HUGE selection of tequila and margaritas.... They even have a tequila flight. I had the berry mojito-awesome and not too sweet. The Bellini-super sweet if you're into that be prepared for a brain freeze. The skinny margarita was also so so good! Oh and if your a Bloody Mary lover they have a make your own Bloody Mary bar!! Super awesome!   Our server Danny was awesome! He was  super friendly and provided awesome service! Keep up the great work Danny!  Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I'd love to stretch to 4 stars on this one but I just can't. For Mesa, it's about as good as it gets. Great location off Val Vista, food is above average, drinks well made. Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Not sure what it is, it's just missing something? The bar is usually the happening place. Great for small/medium groups as you can score a seat almost any night of the week."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great service, best margaritas in town!"}
{"text":"We hosted a company dinner here the other night. We had great service and the food was good. The margarita choices were amazing! I would definitely come back here. Loves it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they have removed the oysters from the menu and now the ceviche and crab cakes from the happy hour menu. Flies all over food on patio."}
{"text":"This is/was our all time favorite place for Sunday Brunch! The food tastes so good, best tasting food I've ever had; and the Bloody Mary Bar rocked! Closed???!!! That just breaks my heart!!!! NOOOOOO!!!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance took me to TQLA for dinner the other night. It was good, but in the car ride home I wasn't riffling through my calendar for the next opportunity to return.   I had a house margarita, rocks/salt, which was sweet and didn't taste handmade. Non-HH for $6.50 or so. I attached a photo of their better-priced HH selections. Fiance stuck w/water, and we shared the Trio appetizer. The mango habanero salsa was unique, sweet at first with a slow and staunch delayed heat. Yummy and unique but not the type of salsa to eat a whole mess of. Guac and queso were good but nothing to write home about.  For our entree, we shared fajitas. Chicken & Steak ($24). The seasonings and trimmings were great, but the steak had an abundance of gristle and made bites complicated and somewhat off-putting. As stated, flavors were nice, and proportions were appropriate. The rice & beans were unique and tasty. A little extra panache provided by corn, peppers and a cream sauce.   The 3/5 star reasoning; for the money there are a lot of other restaurants I'd rather patronize. Also, for the price, I would have expected a better cut of steak in the fajitas. I know that fajita meat isn't the best of the best, but it needed to be better.   I'll be back... For Happy Hour"}
{"text":"Had Tyler as our server again and he was just as great. This place has become a new favorite of mine. The queso dip is so delicious! So is the Patron XO flan. Oh, and I could put that green salsa on everything. So far, my favorite entree has been the pepita crusted salmon with fried green tomatoes. I'll definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Jason in the bar is amazing! Super friendly conversation and awesome service! He went above and beyond for us despite how many people he was serving. Love nothing more then great conversation with our host and he exceeds the expectation! Well done Jason!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ceviche and the crab cakes are to die for!! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Had the Carne Asada. I really enjoyed it. My wife really liked the Sangria and they so have a margarita sampler! Yummy!   Probably great for a date but was really dark when was there with my family. Server was a little slow but was training so not completely her fault. Nice atmosphere. Would definitely go back but maybe this time with just my wife to enjoy the dark ambience a little more."}
{"text":"I have been here 30 times if you live in the Val Vista Lakes or Gilbert in general it is a great place to have a drink.  The ambiance is good especially for the gilbert area and the outdoor patio is awsome as long as its not 110.  The food can be a little hit and miss but the fajitas with the Chipotle butter are awsome.  I literally get the steak and shrimp fajitas and a frozen margarita with a grand manier topper almost every time and it is always fantastic.  The chicken enchiladas or beef with the mole is also very good.  If you like bloody mary's they have a bar on sundays with like 30 ingredients and u make your own."}
{"text":"Me and My wife went for lunch and were in the mood for some really good fajitas, We were not sure about this place since we are Mexican food snobs.We walked in and were impressed with all the out door and patio seating and the style of the place. The margarita was so good and the shrimp and steak fajitas were awesome, beans and rice were OK but I never eat that anyway when Im pinching bites of fajitas with warm corn tortillas and dippin it in their bomb salsa..It was good the best fajitas in town on the eastside other than going to mesa where there are some pretty good spots as well but these fajitas are done right.. saw someone who ordered the civic he  and that looked really good too."}
{"text":"Good food here. I tried the quest Blanca dip (moms), ceviche, and shrimp enchiladas. All were very tasty. I also enjoyed the sangria margarita and the house tequilas. Great place!"}
{"text":"Really great food and a fun ambiance. I wish happy hour was on the weekend as well or at least until 7 during the week so we could frequent it."}
{"text":"TQLA owner. What can I say but, please revisit your staff. Starting with the GM. He was rude condescending and very unprofessional. That is not the description of great customer service. The waitress, Heather was very nice, sincere and accommodating today. That is what I call customer service. Your GM can learn a lot from her. I made a comment on Yelp while we were still there and the GM came and confronted me with a boldface lie."}
{"text":"Went to TQLA for a nice dinner on Saturday 12/15/2012 with my husband. Was quite excited about trying a new restaurant out. Decor and ambiance = Fantastic. We sat at the high top tables near the bar which makes for great people watching. We had chips and salsa as well as guacamole. The red-ish warm salsa was amazing as well as the guacamole. Chips were also light and crispy just how I like them. My husband and I ordered the carne asada plate with the recommendation from our fantastic waitress Holli (definitely recommend sitting at one of her tables!!!). The meat was cooked to perfection. I usually have my carne asada cooked a little bit longer than most and it still did not lack any flavor and definitely wasn't over cooked. The tortillas were freshly made which always is two thumbs up in my book. I also had the red sangria which was good. Would have like to see some more fruit inside of the drink itself but that's just personal preference. My husband got the traditional house margarita on the rocks and was pretty shocked at how strong it was - so that too deserves a thumbs up. All in all we will definitely be back soon and dine in Holli's section."}
{"text":"I would have given TQLA 5 stars but what stopped me short was the noise.  This is a great place.  Food was excellent, drinks were right on (I had a Lemon Drop Martini and it was delightful) and our server was very nice.  I had made reservations for 6 but had 3 unexpected guests arrive and they accommodated us with no fuss at all.    Now, even though we had 9 at our table we were seated very close and comfortable and really should have been able to enjoy each others conversations but since the music was so loud all patrons were talking loud and therefore we couldn't hear anyone that wasn't sitting right next to us.  This is/was my only complaint.  No reason for the music to be so loud during dinner hour."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Food was decent. House margarita was average to above average. Maybe a return could happen if we sit at the bar- no 10 minute waits for drink refills there."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for mothers day. It was very busy and we did not have a reservation but they did accomodate us and sat us at a table on the patio. We ordered our food and the waitress came out with cinnamon crisp chips and honey butter dip. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy, it was supposed to come with green chili but the only green chili was in the mashed potato. The chicken was dry and there was very little gravy. My mother ordered the breakfast tacos. They had bacon egg and cheese in them. The eggs were dry and not fluffy overall very bland and they did not come with salsa, i asked the waitress to bring some and she did accomodate. My girlfriend had the juevos rancheros she indicated that they were very bland as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome patio. Went on a Friday night. The food was great. The ceviche was enough for a meal, and very tasty! 4 stars only due to the long wait and my food being done the wrong way, but was corrected VERY quickly. Oh and if you like Tequila (I don't) this place is a must for you! I have been here for Sunday brunch and that was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Was nice but now closed leaving us stuck with a useless gift card.  really nice place to relax, have a drink and some great food."}
{"text":"My bf and I went for dinner on Saturday night.  We made it in time for Happy Hour, so we decided to try a variety of appetizers; carne asada quesadilla, crab cakes, fried oysters, ceviche and calamari.  We concluded that the only appetizer we might order again was the fried calamari.  The rest were just awful.  The crab cakes were not crispy or well-seasoned, the quesadilla was barely warm, the ceviche was extremely bland and the fried oysters tasted \"not-so-fresh\".  Everything tasted like it had been prepared well in advance and had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Also, not sure if we should blame the kitchen or our server, but all of the appetizers came out at once.  Two people sharing five appetizers should have clued someone in to stagger the items. The best thing going for TQLA is the decor and ambience.  The patio is a really nice feature, too.  It's too bad because we had such high hopes for this new restaurant.  However, if Saute (the previous occupant) couldn't make it serving fantastic food, TQLA, sadly, has no chance of surviving.  One last thing - the booths, oddly, were the most uncomfortable we've ever sat in!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant, and then dreamed about repeating a wonderful experience? No? I must be sleep deprived. Or hungry...  I probably would never had tried this restaurant if it hadn't been for my friend that lives in Gilbert. We met for a little shopping and lunch, and decided to try TQLA.   The restaurant is nicely decorated, and the outside patio is super cute!   We split the steak fajitas, and OMG! they were so good!   The meat, I believe, is ribeye, and was very tender and flavorful. What makes it even better is that when the sizzling platter comes to your table, there is a little butter on top of the meat (YUM!). There was a little cup of something on the side that we thought was a flavored butter, and we just plopped it right on top, and it was really tasty (we think it may be an ancho butter, and it was really good).   The personnel are very nice and attentive, as well.   Anyway, I'm dreaming of those fajitas. Every night."}
{"text":"Went back to the scene of the crime with a better date to try the food tonight after my ill fated attempt last visit. The Happy hour tacos are two for $3.50 and we tried all versions. I liked the shredded chicken version best and she was a fan of the steak ones. They all were very filling for the price. The chips were fresher this visit and the red salsa came out steaming hot and had a nice charred kick. I still like the green, but the gap is closing. Also, grab a $4 frozen margarita because it's very hot out and the booze in this version will sneak up and hit you on the way out. We had a very nice server too who was quite attentive."}
{"text":"Best taco salad I have had in Phoenix! Fiancé got the pumpkin margarita, which was amazing. I went ahead and tried her rice and beans too, very complex and amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour. $3 beers, good drinks, very good salsa. Meals are 10-15. We had the Baja ceviche was good. I had the chicken chili relleno, it was ok. My wife's salad was not good. It was supposed to have a mix of lettuce, but had basic ice burg with lots of the thick end pieces. Would go back for drums and chips and salsa, but no for dinner.  No traditional Mexican, but I don't think they claim to be. They are more like a Abuelo's, but not as good."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend with the family it was awesome !not only is the food amazing the staff was great in making sure we were comfortable   We wanted to sit outside so we choose the couches and after the food came  we decided it would be more comfortable  on a table with the five of us so our waiter cleaned and set up a table for us  in seconds and then moved everything over . they gave the kids these wiki sticks  along with there crayons and coloring pages which was amazing because it kept my little ones busy .  I will defiantly be back there again"}
{"text":"SUPER long wait time for a table. We went on a Friday at about 5pm and had to wait about 45min for a table and there was hardly any room to stand.  The bar is located towards the front of the restaurant, which is smart but it's way too small during happy hour.   They have a second bar towards the back but it's more for the people sitting in the patio area.  They have misters in the summer and heating lamps in the winter.  I didn't see anyone eating in the patio area tho, they were mostly drinking so I'm not sure if you can actually order food from there since the seating is more lounge(y) with no actual tables except for small coffee tables.   As of Sept 16, 2014, they have  1/2 priced appetizers during Happy Hour, and $4.50 house margaritas, $3 Mexican drafts, and $4 house wine.    Food was pretty good - I would describe their menu as mexican-american.  If you plan on going during happy hour on a Friday, expect a wait or make reservations!"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour on a warm evening, but I don't think I'd be here for the regular menu. It's more like Cali/Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food. Server was a really ditzy blonde that needed some extra brain power but she made for good people (er...person) watching?"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place tonight. Holy cow have I been missing out! Had the queso dip which is off the charts amazing, and it was great they have tasty chips and salsa too. For dinner I tried their Grilled Fish tacos. I have had fish tacos all over the US and these were for sure the best fish tacos I've ever had, juicy, fresh and topped with a delicious aioli sauce and pineapple medley of some sort. Our server Maria was super awesome and very pleasant, she suggested the Ultimate marg and it definitely hit the spot, I could tell it was fresh and non of that premade marg mixes. All in all, gotta check this place out if in the area, I know I will again!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times and wish I lived closer! Service is great, margaritas are great, and the shrimp tacos are bomb."}
{"text":"Made reservations online for a bday brunch. I thought it was weird that I made the reservation and with no one in the restaurant we still had to wait for them to set up tables for us. Waited quite some time for our \"build your own\" Bloody Mary bar drinks to come out but overall we had a good experience. We had a lot of fun making our own drinks and the food was great! Service lacked a bit. But we will definitely try this out once the weather cools off for dinner."}
{"text":"I love TQLA! The atmosphere food and service are top notch! Fabulous patio but indoors is just as awesome. They have an infused Margarita flavor of the month. Habenero blackberry is my favorite but the others are yummy too!  Tuesday night special Fajitas for 2 plus 2 house margaritas for $25! Great happy hour specials 7 days a week. I highly encourage you to check this place out!  I wanna send a shout out to my favorite server... Lita YOU ROCK GIRL! Thank you for always taking such good care of us :)"}
{"text":"Best fajitas I have had! I have been searching so long for good ones and now I have found them. So much flavor and the chipotle butter that comes with them is delish!"}
{"text":"Normally decent service. I show up tonight at 9:55pm and couldn't find anyone at the front or in the restaurant. I walked through the restaurant looking for someone to seat us and found someone coming out of the kitchen. He told me that the kitchen closed at 10. I would normally not show up so late but none of their online presence I saw says anything about the kitchen closing at 10pm, it just says they are open until 11."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the reviews and I wish I went somewhere else. The food tasted awful and the service was terrible. Our server stated he wasnt mych of a drinker and couldn't reccomend any drinks for happy hour because he was underage and he didn't try to find anyone to help us. He took our drink order and then came back to tell us the infused margaritas were not part of happy hour like he originally said. The people sitting behind us arrived about 10 mins after we did and they had their food before he took our order. The drinks how ever tasted pretty good and were decently strong"}
{"text":"Still loving their happy hours!!! The crab cakes are to die for, little spicy sauce gives them a kick. And wash them off with one or a few house margaritas!!!   I also tried a few of their tequilas, they were iced cold, very nice. No more HH on weekends so remember good deal are M - F before 7:00pm."}
{"text":"OK I'm whipping out 5 stars for the brunch carne asada and eggs alone.  The carne asada was fantastic!  When they sit the plate down, it looks like a seasoned NY strip.  What it is, is some of the most tender and flavorful carne asada you will ever have.  I could stop right there.  That's all you need to know...OH and it's only $12.50.  But also when we were there for brunch, my husband ordered his usual bacon, eggs, and taters, which was a great deal as well for $7.50, and while he did enjoy that, he said he wished he would have ordered the carne asada after he tried a few bites of my breakfast.    We had a couple of brunch mojitos ($5 each) and tried the prickly pear lemonade, also 5 bucks during brunch.  I didn't catch the bartender's name, but he was awesome.  So friendly and fun to talk to, without hovering over us.  This is definitely a favorite brunch spot.  Go get some of that carne asada!"}
{"text":"So first off it is extremely noisy so it is probably not the easiest place to have a quiet conversation however the food is really top-notch we had the crab cakes which you've seen in other reviews which is absolutely outstanding and my wife had the fish tacos I have three of them and they actually have a sweet taste I had a special chicken chili relleno which was excellent stuffed with a chicken and with a light fried I'm everything comes with rice and beans obviously extremely popular margaritas and tequila is so except for the fact that the noise level is very high I recommend it"}
{"text":"Living across the street from this restaurant we have been anticipating the opening for quite sometime. I really really wanted to like this place but honestly I probably will never go back at least not for the food. There are 2 choices of salsa neither very flavorful. We ended up having to add a lot of salt to the fire roasted red salsa to get any flavor, the green was just sweet. I order a bloody Mary which was a big mistake, probably the worst I ever had. This place had only been open a week, so I wont criticize the wait staff too much but it was one disaster after another. We order the guacamole for our appetizer but did not receive it  until after our meal. My meal which was the carne asda was decent however, I couldn't eat it because it was cooked medium rare after I requested for it to be medium well. Our waitress consistently reassured us it \"was not her fault\" and played the blame game on the kitchen which was a little awkward as we were not complaining just wanted our food. The manager came over and we gave him some feedback. He was very pleasant and understanding, he offered to get me something different since the meat was undercooked. I declined and he took the charge off of our bill instead. I think this place has potential, and only being open a week there is a lot of kinks to work out. Unfortunately besides the guacamole I was pretty disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"idk why this place doesn't have 5 stars from everyone?!?! everything is DELICIOUS.  best fajitas in the whole world. not even joking. I have a hard time ordering anything else so I don't. but I have tried other things from friends and everything has been awesome!  they have this tequila-infused butter that they serve with stuff and it's insane. and they have the most delicious onions with their fajitas. the tortillas taste freshly made. the complimentary chips and salsa are super great.    worth coming here for every meal."}
{"text":"Wow what a horrible experience. Right from the start I should've walked out. Our greet took over ten minutes, the server didn't know anything about their tequila menu. I didn't even know they had a separate tequila menu until over half way through my meal. Then the prices on their menu were not the prices of their tequilas. The manager dropped off the food, after twenty five minutes, said nothing and didn't even try to clear our appetizers that were obviously finished and just clutter on our table. The tacos were served in tin foil, looked terrible and were not anything worth ordering, the fish tacos looked bland and tasted the same. The steak tacos didn't look or taste like anything resembling steak, it was some sort of beef but not in any way should it have been called steak. The final straw, no pun intended, was when I took a drink out of my water and felt a weird texture on my straw. I stopped and looked at it and found lip stick caked on the outside and inside the straw, luckily I had paid my tab so I was able to quickly leave my table and go outside to scrub my mouth out with my shirt and hope that it would prevent me from contracting herpes from the incident. Pretty much the worst experience I could imagine, I know they are new and you should give them time to figure it out but I would never go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good service here. They clearly work together as a team for the customer experience. Tasty food - chips & salsa, crawfish enchiladas. I had lunch at the bar - headed back to work so didn't try the extensive tequila and libation  selection. Next time.  Garage style doors out to the patio...thinking its a good happy hour spot. TBD :). Bartender, Danielle, took care of me. I need to dance through the menu with friends to give the full set of stars. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party.  Server did a good job with a large party.  I ordered the original margarita.  It is served in a smaller glass as others have stated, but it was a good size for me so I didn't mind.  The drink was delicious.  I didn't order food, but from the looks of my friends plates, the portions are very small.  I'll be back for the chilled tequila shots."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here for Sunday brunch, lunch & dinner! The food is very tasty and the margaritas are great! The prickly pear margarita is my fav!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have brunch once a month. This month we planned to go to Snooze in Gilbert, but there was over an hour wait so we went to Tqla instead and it was one of the best decisions! Carafes of mimosas, a bloody mary (maria) bar, great food and service. Two thumbs up from all 10 of us girls!"}
{"text":"Service was very good. However the food is only a touch above taco bell. Ordered the chicken tinga chimi style with enchilada sauce. Chicken was dry and flavorless. Sooooo much bread vs. Fillings. So disappointing. I'll at taco bell next time for half the price and more flavor."}
{"text":"Carne asada seekers need to read this!   We came here because of the rave reviews for the carne asada. Readers should be aware that the carne asada is a steak, rather than thinly sliced meat. My husband ordered medium to medium well but it came out well done. Trying to cut the steak into slices to put on the tortilla was very difficult. The taste, with the grilled onions and jalapeño cheese they put on it was very different than the traditional citrus carne asada flavor. It is not our preference and we would not order it again.   The chips and salsa was very good, one of our favorites that we've tastes. The guacamole is pre made and tastes okay but not fresh.   I had the 3 taco platter without the rice and beans (addl $2 charge for rice and beans). The carne asada taco had a strong smokey flavor that is not our favorite. The barbacoa was tender and good but nothing unique or rememberable. The chicken tinga was fantastic and I would happily order it again. All of the tacos had a healthy amount of meat on them.   Service was decent but nothing special. I didn't realize they had a Sunday brunch because it was on the back of the menu. Probably would've orders that but the chicken tinga taco was good enough that I'm ok with missing the rare opportunity for brunch.   The iced tea had obviously been made with a machine that makes coffee. Coffee flavored tea is definitely not my thing. Yuck! Luckily the water was decent and didn't taste like we were licking a rock.   The bill for two meals, guac and 2 non alcoholic drinks was $50. Definitely not worth that price in our opinion. I'd go back to get one or two alacarte chicken tinga tacos if that was an options."}
{"text":"Went here just for some drinks for happy hour. The service was great. Free chips & salsa (so good). We'll be back to try out some food!"}
{"text":"Our company held a business meeting here just yesterday and although I had never eaten here previously I had seen good things and heard good things about it so we were hopeful and loved it! We had our meeting in their private room, which is very nice- it's a little loud while they're prepping, etc...however we'd definitely come back with a microphone or just as a business lunch. The patio also looks like a great location for a nice business lunch. Don, the GM, is GREAT!!! He was very detail oriented, conscious of our needs, the servers were awesome and everyone loved the food. We had another vendor bring a machine into the restaurant and Don was very accommodating with this as well.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could - simply because of the noise during our business meeting portion, other than that - it was great.  We sincerely appreciate the great food and service and plan to be back!"}
{"text":"First all I have to say is thank God TQLA is in the easy valley.... Last night was our first visit and will not be our last.  We sat in the bar (are go to spot) even though tables we available.  The bartenders were both very nice, and very helpful... Off to a great start...   We were offered chips and salsa. I know what you are thinking big deal! Well yeah the chips were chips, but the 3 yes 3 salsas were incredible.  First you're more traditional roasted pepper salsa, not the typical tomato puree with some onions.  Next a favorable guacamole tomatillo, and the kicker, what they called the \"good luck\" salsa, black eyed pees with onion & cilantro, best salsa of the night.  It was happy hour with appetizers half off, such a great deal, we chose the Baja Ceviche.  Now here is something do don't find out side of Scottsdale ... fresh seafood who would of thunk? Nice presentation with lots of seafood, my only comment maybe a little more lime..  For the entree we went with the craw fish & spinach enchiladas.  Everything about this was first rate.  The black beans had flavor, not like they just rolled them out of a can, and even the rice was memorable. Next time they have an appetizer of Craw fish Hush Puppies I have to try.   I would not call this place a Mexican restaurant, more of a Southwest fusion of three types of cuisine.  I would call it a cross between Cajun, Tex-Mex, and Mexican.  The menu is not large (good thing), but they do have a nice variety of choices, including vegetarian choices.  My wife and I both love this type of food, and we have search the east valley, and until now have not found a place to keep coming back to.  We were so desperate that we actually went to \"One the Boarder\" a couple of times, it makes me gag just thinking about it.  For me if you live around the 60 in Mesa you have to try it at least once. Thursdays are the night to be here we ended up next to a group that make Thursday's their TQLA night, and we were welcomed into the pack. So I hope to see you all next Thursday at TQLA it's a fun time and so far Great Food."}
{"text":"Love coming here, especially for the margaritas! They have an amazing happy hour and our server Ty was beyond amazing!  Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Two words: crab cakes. From the bangin' warm salsa to the delicious quatro leches cake this agave bar is my cup of tea. With half price appetizers and $2 off of tequila this is the perfect place for Happy hour."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC !!!  We ate here last Friday for my husband's birthday.  Since we wanted to try different things, we just had several appetizers rather than ordering entrees. The chips brought to the table were very good, freshly made in house.  The salsas were dynamite, not your typical restaurant salsa.  We ate: 1. Baja Ceviche  - absolutely perfect! 2. Queso Blanco - tasty, but nothing special. 3. Crawfish Hushpuppies - very unique and delicious. 4.  Duck Tamale - imaginative and outstanding! The Margaritas were very good but not in the top 5 best I've ever had. The service was excellent.  Erica was our server and.did a great job.  She had a large area to cover, including one big party.   The reasons I did not give five stars are for the noise level, and for the slow service from the bar.  This was due to the lack of help behind the bar rather than any shortcoming on the part of Erica."}
{"text":"Just a bad experience. Walked in, sat down in the bar area. Never greeted. Took 10 minutes to have a server finally come to our hightop and bring us menus. I actually had called the store and spoke to a host. Was in the process of asking her to send a server to my table. She arrived as I hung up, lol. She proceed to act like it wasn't her mistake but she would help us. By the way, only a handful of people in the restaurant. She forgot our check and took several minutes to realize her mistake. Server seems like a nice girl, just an awful server. We frequent TQLA because it in our neighborhood, but the service has always been poor. The food is okay and the Tqla is great. Just don't think we will be coming here any longer. We will make it a point to not recommended our friends here also. Too bad because it's a nice atmosphere. Work on customer service for future reference."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here so I can't give a 100% on my review. We always come and have a few cocktails and shots and chill in the bar. I give it 3 stars because of our waitress September, but wanted to give 2 stars because its pricey for drinks only."}
{"text":"Beware the ceviche! Fish was over sized and the flavor was lacking.   Service was good to slightly above average. Tequila flight was over priced and didn't have anything that would be considered a sipping tequila. All served like a shot. Slightly disappointing. Rice and black beans were average. Good vibe if you like a family setting."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of this place. I very much enjoyed their happy-hour food, their unique salsa with chips, their drinks and their live music. That was a then; now, they completely changed. Their happy-hour food-qualities greatly diminished with new recipes and lesser quantities; simultaneously, they increased their prices. Their unique salsa (I know people who would showed up just to buy to-go salsa) was replaced by a very average (almost no good) recipe and the chips are now store-bought quality. Finally I haven't seen any live entertainment for quite some time. My wife and I both feel the same about TQLA and have verbally agreed not to go back after our last few experiences. Adios TQLA."}
{"text":"I am sure on any other night, we would have been able to give a better review. Although our server was very good, we barely got to see him because they were so understaffed. They explained that they didn't expect the rush but the day before a three-day holiday weekend, come on. I work in the restaurant industry most of my life and everyone knows that those are some of the busiest days. And one of our companions never even received a drink they ordered at the beginning of the meal. They should try and make up for it by giving us a free appetizer on our next trip, however the location it's so far out of our normal area, and the food was so OK that nothing would probably bring me back there."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time this afternoon during happy hour.  We found their Happy Hour deals to be great.  Our server, April was wonderful and allowed us to take our time without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"Prices are a little high but overall it's great food. The chips and salsa were awesome. The green was my favorite but the red salsa was a very close second. I had the veggie enchilada and the veggies were wrapped in a blue corn tortilla with a green chili queso on top. Delish! The veggies inside were perfect, nice and crisp. Such a great texture with everything being cubed. I can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"The spinach and cod quesadilla sounded like a strange choice, but it was sooo good! Hands down one of my favorites. The chips and salsa were worth going for alone. We ate outside by the fire pit and even had blankets to keep warm. Fun place and good food, but just a little pricy."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Mango margarita was amazing, the calamari is the best I have ever had. Went just for drinks and appetizers  with girlfriends but will be returning with my husband for actual dinner.  The fajitas smelled and looked great and service was on point!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has received 2 and 3 stars.  Maybe it's a few disgruntled employees that left tqla.  We had one of the best tasting dinners I've experienced thus far here in Arizona.  The tamale was perfect, the salsas were toasty warm and delicious, the drinks were absolutely fantastic.  Fresh, chilled, on-tap tequila?  I never knew.  And, how many places have happy hour 7 days a week?  Looking forward to going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, group events and/or date night!   I normally get the house margarita and appetizers for happy hour- I recommend the tamales or the calamari. The tequila flights are a must for group events. The tacos are good but not very filling. Overall it's a nice new add to Dana park!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and the food has been consistently good with great service.  For appetizers I hear the ceviche is good (I'm not a ceviche person) but I personally love the duck tamale.   The lunch menu has a blackened tilapia that is really good for a fair price.  For drinks there are plenty of tequilas and margaritas that are mixed well."}
{"text":"I went to TQLA with a group of friends after hiking so we were hungry and ready to eat.  We sat in the bar area and our server quickly came over with chips and salsa and took our drink order.  Their avocado salsa was amazing and I would go just to eat that and drink a few beers.    I had the carnitas burrito off their lunch menu my friends had the Fajitas and Baja Tacos .  The food was good and everyone enjoyed their lunch but the food is more tex mex then authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Love TQLA! Happy Hour Rocks! You can sit anywhere in the restaurant! Food is yummy, appetizer quesadillas are the best."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it's underwhelming.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and others at the table ordered the shrimp tacos.  Good chorizo and eggs is just that, chorizo and eggs.  Not tomato, other veg, and bland chorizo.  This dish was marginal.  Just go to the other 1,000 places that serve chorizo.  Overall, everything was bland.  The Bloody Mary bar is a nice idea but also somewhat average as far as the mixers.  Maybe later in the day for dinner or drinks but brunch or lunch, no thanks.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was soso, service was absolutely horrible, we are literally sitting here right now and have been for about 15 minutes waiting for our table to be cleared, and had to flag someone down just for our check.  There's probably an equal amount of servers as there are customers in here right now! I wanted to try something new for my birthday so we came here, NEVER again!!"}
{"text":"Although we were sweaty from our Superstition Mountains hike, we headed to this restaurant (around 11am) for some replenishing food and some tequila type drinks. It's in the name, right?  Sometimes I can be a wimp with some spicy foods but for some reason, I adore spicy drinks. Our waitress, Danielle, recommended the habeñero blackberry margarita. I enjoyed my first one. It was a blend of spicy, sweet, and salty all in one. However, when asked how it was, I expected it to be a bit spicier. She said that the tequila was habañero infused but probably didn't have enough time for the infusion to occur. She was on a mission. She and the bartender concocted a second drink with sliced habañeros in it. Voilá! The spicy bite I was looking for was a success! I was incredibly grateful for their efforts!  As far as foods go, I ordered the steak fajitas. Really good stuff! However, my awesome spicy margarita way over-shadowed the fajitas and I think that's why I remember that more than the fajitas. The guac-salsa was also very yummy with the chips while waiting for the food to arrive at the table. This review is about a month overdue but I had to write it! We were so very happy with our service here and would love to return again if it wasn't so far from where I live!"}
{"text":"I came here with my Book Club and we sat on the patio. Our service was great and the drinks were delicious! I had the veggie enchiladas and loved them so much that I have been back twice to try them again! Next on the menu to try is the 5 degree tequila!"}
{"text":"E just got back from TQLA....loved it! Carne asada was so good. Fried oysters, guacamole,and drinks were all great. Will recommend to my friends and neighbors."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as it is close to my work, and their happy hour is not disappointing. Margaritas are under $5 and many appetizers and small plates are also discounted. I love their salsas. The warm red one is good, but the green is my fave. Their crab cakes with the corn sauce are darned tasty. The guac is good and my friends like the tacos here. They were pretty busy on a Friday at 530, so be prepared to wait for a table, even for just two ppl. There was also live music, which was so loud, it would have been impossible to have a conversation if we'd Sat in the bar."}
{"text":"We thought it was great. Went on nat'l tequila day and it was super busy. But everything we had (margaritas, 2 tequila flights, shared fajitas for two) was excellent. Atmosphere was wonderful. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"The food was yummi. However, the service was not acceptable. We waiting for 30 minutes after ordering. And asked on an update on our food. The order was not placed. My sisters drink had to be sent back twice. Once the food came out two or the four orders were wrong. Very poor service. Sorry TQLA. I recommend that you offer better service."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - War - Low Rider)  All my friends know the T-Q-LA The T-Q-LA makes me a little hungry  T-Q-LA drinks a little spicy T-Q-LA is a real goer  T-Q-LA knows a good fajita, yeah T-Q-LA is the one to eat, yeah   TQLA is a modern Southwestern restaurant located in the hot spot of Mesa in the Dana Park Village Square.    I came here with some friends for brunch after a long hike at The Lost Dutchman.  The staff was very accommodating since our group went from big to small and had to switch tables.  My friend shot for a spicy margarita and bloody mary while I went for a beer.  They have tequilas on tap, but as we all know that's my Kryptonite!  The bloody mary was nothing too special according to my buddy while the spicy margaritas was not spicy.  Our server later went out of her way to make a second, but this time with some habanero peppers; which really made the drink awesome!    For our entrees I got the fried fish tacos and both my friends ordered Fajitas.  I loved the blackbeans that came with my tacos; sweet and creamy.  My fish tacos were good, but way too big for a taco.  Looked like entire fillet of fish breaded and place in a small corn tortilla.  I ate only 2 and gave the rest to my buddy.  Well breaded for sure with a crunchy texture along with the cabbage slaw within.  My friends fajitas were pretty good according to them, but I had a taste of it and the beef was juicy and tender. - Enjoy!  Overall, a solid spot for some Southwestern bite and the service is always welcoming.  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So let me preface this review by saying that any place that has tequila on tap that is chilled to 5 degrees is a winner in my book!!!  HUGE selection of tequilas...and this one item on the menu that will leave you wanting more.  Queso! White Queso..with chips and chorizo.  I died.  A thousand deaths.    The food was tasty and the tequila was icy! Nothing could be better!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place while on yelp looking for a Bloody Mary bar.  Not only did it have a awesome Bloody Mary bar but the ambiance and service was amazing.  We had a server named heather who went above and beyond and we were only having drinks.  Also the tequila in tap I pretty cool to ."}
{"text":"Mexican fare with a super nice atmosphere!   Wait staff was cordial and friendly. Modern and elegant design to this restaurant and the wide openness makes for a private experience. It was unusually private for 7:30 on a Saturday night. The place was empty. Not taking this as a sign, we ordered the chicken and steak fajitas along with some street tacos. While both steak and chicken were tasty, the steak was overly gristley and we had to discreetly discard the fat with each bite. Not pleasant.  \"Street  tacos\". This must mean that they can make the smallest taco possible and sell it for normal / street price. They were microscopic!  2 bites each. Or if your hungry, 1 bite. I had no idea you could make a taco that small!  I don't suggest the margaritas. We ordered 2 house margaritas and each drink had maybe 3 weak sips in each glass. Not even served in a Margherita glass. Mostly ice. Pretty lame.   You'd think a place called TQLA wouldn't skimp on the TQLA! Stick to Cerveza.  2 star dining experience."}
{"text":"Food: Okay. Prices: Not okay. Atmosphere: Nice. Service: Okay.  Thats all folks!"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place for Happy Hour and I was not disappointed!  $4.50 happy hour margs were tasty and potent.  The chips and salsas were very good.  Green one was nice and refreshing, and the warm one had a nice kick to it.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  Let us sample their frozen margarita too.  The BF had the steak tacos which he said were great.  I ordered the crab cakes and the crawfish hushpuppies.  The crab cakes were really good, nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Beautifully presented.  The hushpuppies were sooo good!  At first I thought they were really greasy because they were shiny and what I thought was oil, was puddled in the bottom of the plate.  It turned out it was some sort of sweet stuff drizzled over them, and there was a salsa on the side too.  The sweetness combined with the spicy salsa was just great!  I thoroughly enjoyed them and even though I was full after about 3 of them, I kept eating until they were all gone.  Yum yum.  All in all, I left with a buzz and a full belly.  We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food, really great.  Service, good. Atmosphere....great looking place, but not a really fun atmosphere.  Been here twice, Friday happy hour and a Wednesday dinner.  Friday at the bar was mildly busy, good bartenders.  Wednesday was dead, but food was great.  Great place to hit before going out to Scottsdale. Will be back, but not a sports, dance, bar type of place.  Drinks a bit pricy.  Margarita and a \"specialty\" drink, $18...on happy hour pricing.  A bit high...."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Monday for happy hour. The place was pretty empty but it was mid day. We had margaritas which were very good! They said they had flavored but I didn't know it would be an extra 1.50 to a tiny bit of flavor to my drink. We ordered tacos and ceviche and the food was very bland and dry. Nothing even remotely good about what we ordered. Everything needed salt and we are anti salt people. We would only return for drinks. Bartender was nice but not too knowledgable every question we asked started with a \"uhhhhhmmmmm\""}
{"text":"Just ate there with my pop.  Awesome food and pretty good margs. I got the chicken quesadilla and it was phenomenal!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night we went to that TQLA opening night dinner in Mesa.  We both enjoy the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. We started with 2 margaritas that were fantastic!  I had the Blood Orange margarita and my wife had the TQLA house margarita.  Both had sweet flavor and a good kick!  The chips were fresh and we enjoyed both salsas.  The Green is a tomatillo with a sweet (almost pineapple) and no kick.  The Red is also sweet, but it does have a nice bite to it.  Since it was a opening party the menu was limited; however, we were very satisfied with the choices we had.  For appetizer we had the Tres Amigos.  This had three choices for your chips.  A nice healthy portion of guacamole, a quest blanco and a habanero salsa.  All three were very good.  The Habanero had a sweetness to it and a little kick.  Not bad though.  It is more of a sauce than a salsa.  For dinner I had the Carnitas Soft Taco plate.  The meat was moist and the caramelized onions and the crema were good addition.  My wife had the Carne Asada plate and we both agree that this was the best Carne Asada we can remember in a restaurant!  A good portion with a fantastic marinade!  The steak was not chewy or dry and was grilled perfectly.  We both enjoyed the \"Green Rice\" which was a cilantro rice and the black beans were a good touch compared to the traditional refried.  My only small complaint was they drizzled the rice and beans with a sour cream.  I do not care much for sour cream.  I wish they would have asked.  My wife likes it, jso she had no issue.  Overall, it was a very good experience!  I wish TQLA success in the Valley!  This TX concept could open a few more throughout the Valley and do well!"}
{"text":"We were excited to check out this new restaurant! We were left extremely underwhelmed. We sat in the bar to watch MNF. It would have been nice to be able to hear the game over the discordant pop rock music at a mexican establishment but I understand that you are not a \"sports bar\". It was Monday night and with the exception of a large group  of blue hairs celebrating secretary's day the place was empty.  The bar area managed to fill up, because the Cardinals were on tv and it seemed as thought the high tops and patio were busy as well.   Our bartender Amanda was very polite and eager to up sell us their flavored tequilas and specialty cocktails. You can tell she was a little wet behind the ears but she was doing her best nothing a little training and experience can't fix. The wait time to receive a cocktail was excruciatingly long though being a former bartender I understand the complexity that new bars go though to develop new and unique cocktails.  We ordered the pumpkin margarita. I applaud the attempt but personally it tasted like puréed baby food.   I was feeling very open minded and wanted to experience as much as I could that TQLA had to offer so we ordered the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup.    Queso dip: cold Habanero dip: sweet with a swift kick afterwards: not bad Guacamole: good: but was gone after 2 bites. I guess they feel if they place the guacamole on a bed of green shredded lettuce it will look like there is more than delivered. Fail  Chicken tortilla soup: Thick tomato soup with dry dark meat chicken chunks. Maybe it is just me but I prefer a more broth based ck tort soup and juicy white/dark meat chicken. Bleh: Amanda offered to remove it off our bill but I insisted on finishing mine because I was hungry. My GF pushed hers to the side; DNF.   Meanwhile; whilst experience our starters we managed without any silverware or napkins and at this point Amanda being the only bartender on managed to become flooded with specialty cocktails in the well; thus not being able to properly oversee her patrons at the bar. Needles to say our drinks were empty, our plates, monkey dishes, empty bowl of chips, 2 cups of bland tortilla soup, saucers and wrinkled up black beverage napkins (used in the place of the real ones) were all tattering on the edge of the bar eagerly anticipating a bus boy to remove them.   Onto the Entrees:  I ordered the carne Asada steak.  My girlfriend tried the habanero chicken platter. They were delivered by TQLA manager \"Joe\". Whom decidedly pulled himself from enjoying the football game to expedite some food. He crept up behind us and shuffled the entree platters in front of our faces after we spread our dirty dishes closer to the edge of the bar and politely stacked them for our ficticious busboy/girl to remove them properly. Now in my history with management; a decent manager would offer to remove the collection of dishes but instead he decided to ask us if we needed anything else since the look on our faces was disgust. Instead we opted to inform Joe that we would enjoy our meal a little better with silverware and napkins.  He acknowledged that was a novel concept and proceeded to fetch us a pair. Joe wasn't six steps away before he was interrupted by a member of the waitstaff who informed him that what she needed was more important than delivering two setups to some first time customers so they could enjoy their ever increasingly cold food.  At this point my girlfriends temper got the best of her and she jumped up and retrieved her own silverware off of a table in front of Joe and eager waitress to salvage any heat that might have been left in our entrees.   We dig in:    Carne Asada: was tender but lacking the Wow factor.   Habanero Chicken: Tasted like a chicken breast smothered in their warm fire roasted salsa... What happened to the habaneros?  Where is the heat...? Bland  I hope they get better: but until then Nandos all the way. Never saw Joe touch any tables, never offered to help out a bartender who was swimming laps in an Olympic size pool. Occasionally the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out.  This is about the time that our appetizers, chips, soups, and entrees were all removed from the bartop. FYI Joe, the hostess stand can hold itself up on its own. You don't have to stand there and hold it up. Keep an eye on your staff and customers and offer help where they need it so people will be happy to come back and give you a second shot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They don't have the biggest menu out there for food, but what we did have tasted great! They have an outstanding happy hour and more tequila than you can shake a stick at. We had their Margaritas and they were awesome! You can even choose to add flavors to their House Margarita that are not your typical flavors. I had Guava and it was very interesting. The staff was very nice and very helpful since we hadn't been there before. The chips and dip are outstanding!! We also had the Queso Blanco as my wife loves the White Queso dips and it is one of the best we have ever had. The chips that come with it are the blue tortilla chips and they taste delicious. We will be back again soon and we highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"This is a place where it is very hard to stay sober -- especially during happy hour when their delicious extremely well-prepared house margaritas are just $4.50.  An extra-chilled shot (3º F) of high-end tequila is less than $8. The decor is very cool. I don't love that the location is next to a very busy surface street, but they have a huge fan system which all but blocks out the outside world without becoming a distraction.   The staff very friendly and engaging. The chairs comfortable.   I have been there three times and not been disappointed yet. Well, not entirely true. All three times, I have to stop after just two drinks despite wanting more."}
{"text":"Food was good..nice place....prices are decent...  Waiter...was not very informative. .and we were 1 out of 5 tables in the whole place so no  reason to wait 15 minutes for the waiter to pick up the check..not sure on this place.."}
{"text":"Crawfish and spinach enchiladas are pretty good. This is definitely a nice addition to the Gilbert scene. Service was good. I'm sure I'll be back when I'm feeling like a Tequila night."}
{"text":"The Jalapeno Margarita was the best!  The burger, not so much, but the hush puppies were incredible."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. I had a salad and boyfriend had a cheese enchilada plate with rice only. The portions were very small--my boyfriend had to eat something else when we got home.  Also three dollars for a soda--this just pisses me off. What a rip off. The food did taste good,  and our server was nice but probably not ever going to come back. It's just not worth the effort."}
{"text":"I had the fajitas.  I combined the shrimp and steak.  The steak was very good, but I didn't care for the sauce on the shrimp.  My wife had 3 tacos (fish, steak and shrimp.  She also thought the sauce on the shrimp was not right.  She liked the other tacos.  When you arrive, they give you chips and salsa.  The red salsa was our favorite.  Our Daughter had the cheese quesadilla.  This restaurant has a bunch of Tequila (hence the name TQLA).  I have come here at least a dozen times.  It is good, more expensive Mexican food."}
{"text":"Our second venture out in restaurant week brought us to TQLA. It is a large restaurant (maybe it was something else before TQLA?) not sure. Anyway, it is hard to miss, very prominent on Val Vista in front of the shopping center. It was 7:30 on a Tuesday night, but the place was pretty much deserted. To the right was a very large bar area with just a few patrons, and to the left was the dining area...with only 3 tables seated. The hostess immediately seated us, and explained the 2 menus. We told her we were here for restaurant week and she said \"Cool\" and left.   We looked over the menu and made our choices. Our server came over (didn't tell us her name...this is the second time this week...which is odd) She was sweet and attentive, though, and asked us if we wanted a tequila 'fight' We said no, but we wanted a pitcher of the house margaritas. She brought us chips (light, warm and crisp) and 2 kinds of salsa (green and red) Both were good, but only about  2 tablespoons in each tiny dish. We had to ask for refills 3 times.  The margaritas were a big disappointment. I was expecting something spectacular for a tequila bar, but they were way sweet and no way we could taste the tequila. We didn't finish the pitcher (and not because we felt the alcohol AT ALL!)  Things got better with the appetizers. My spicy crab cakes were delicious, and a meal in themselves! The spouse had the ceviche, which he said was fine, but a lot more veggies than seafood.  My entree: the pumpkin crusted salmon was very good, cooked to perfection. It was supposed to come with green chili mashed potatoes, but came with rice instead (?) I was so full from the chips and crab cakes, I took most of it home anyway.  Spouse had the carne asada, which he really liked! He said it was well cooked and seasoned.  Dessert was a chocolate and coffee flan for me (yum!) and blueberry cheesecake for him (just OK)  It was pricey (about $100) for southwestern food and was good, but not great. This is quite a drive for us, so we probably won't be back unless we are in the area. I hope this restaurant makes it...and hopefully they pack the place on weekends!"}
{"text":"I finally made it over to TQLA and  I am blown away !  My previous review was about how great my fiance's leftover fajitas were, so it was time for my own fresh meal! Seriously folks.....get the hell over there....!! NOW!  Their happy hour is sensational....house marg's are pretty smooth and how can you beat 3.00 mexi drafts? My girl had the fajitas and they have super flavor. Not cheap at 18.00 but absolutely incredible flavor. They even have a fajitas for 2 deal on Tuesdays that sounds great..  I ordered the cerviche app and the todo santos nachos. Both were great! Seriously....i almost had a heart attack when i saw the cerviche.... :) Great service as well with John taking care of us. I do believe this is my first 5 star review.  Why not? Great food, great value & great service.  Just go!  I have also tried their white Queso app and their quesadilla app..... Both very good. All of their food has great  flavor. I also gave their crabcakes a whirl......they are not lump crab cakes. They are a shredded consistancy but are tastey and come with some very well developed dipping sauces. Someone spent some time putting those great flavors together. Kudo's ! Heather took great care of us in the bar area for the last few happy hours and they have live music as well on friday evenings.  My new go to spot !!   Previous review: My fiance brought home the leftovers of TQLA's fajitas for two. WOW !! What great flavor on the meat, beans ,onions,peppers and rice ! I took the leftovers and added 2 eggs for a great breakfast. The tortilla chips were good as well...l..nice restaurant style thin chips.  If the leftovers are this good........i'm going !!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by their margaritas and their Chile Relleno.  Well, they don't serve Relleno, but the margaritas were fabulous.  Fresh mix, not that nasty sweet and sour, could have been a bit bigger but for $6.75, who cares.  I had the oyster appetizer and Tortilla soup.  Both were fabulous.  Hubby had chicken soft tacos, served with lots of fresh spinach, very good.  Very good service, but the place was pretty empty, we were there at 11 on a Saturday.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved it! Incredible mix of flavors and definitely a welcome standout from the everyday! We had great service, decor and ambience was modern and warm, and would highly recommend the crawfish and spinach mushroom enchiladas and carnitas tacos. Yumm yum yum. Need I say more?? Also the salsas are fabulous as well. This is a new fave for sure."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  The servers are so friendly and welcoming.  Every time I sit down a big basket of chips and awesome salsas is promptly placed on the table, and refilled if desired.  The food is excellent as well. The TQLA burger is wonderfully composed. The spicy crab cake is inventive and savory. The chicken quesadilla was very well done with very tender chicken and flavorful cheeses.Their house margarita is one of the best in the valley, the fact that it is $4.50 for happy hour every day from 3-7? That is just an awesome bonus. Their super chilled shots and infused tequilas are something to be savored.  I wish they had more seats in the bar area, must have been asked about a dozen times if any seats were open at my table. I also wish the outdoor area wasn't next to a busy street. It is still a fantastic place, and I wont obsess over the little stuff. This is a must try for Gilbert."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for ages! Ok, well, maybe only since i moved back to Phoenix a month ago...but still...in hungry foodie days, a month is FOREVER.  The vibe is cool and trendy and Johnny Anonymous was playing the night we visited...love them!   So first off, I have to say, only two vegetarian options..UGH. Usually mexican places are an easy feat for me when it comes to finding delicious no added meat items. Not so much here...your choices are Vegetable enchiladas with zucchini, squash, sweet potatoes and mushrooms or nachos. Let me say that as a very white looking mexican, I know that sweet zucchini and squash do not go with anything mexican food related. Where the heck is the green chile and beans?  I ordered the Todo Santos Nachos. They were...ok. Not a lot of flavor, but luckily my super hot boyfriend had some tasty queso dip that I added to my mini tostada nachos to liven them up a little.  We also ordered guacamole for the table, which was, eh. The guy who mashes the avocados must have stormed out and quit during his shift, because it was basically halved avos served with a few tomatoes and feta on a sad looking lettuce leaf. Luckily, I am a guac expert, so I mashed those right up with my fork and added some salt pronto which helped us to at least be able to scoop them up with our chips.  I am willing to give TQLA another shot because I am a sucker for brunch, and they offer Sunday brunch, so I will be headed there on a not so distant Sunday. Stay tuned my pretties."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now and both times had an excellent experience.  The first time was on a weeknight and so it was relatively quiet.  The food was good (I ordered off the 550 calorie menu and was very happy!) and the salsa was phenomenal.  The second time was on a CRAZY busy Saturday night and had an equally good experience.  Loved the pork sliders!  Friends had the fajitas and were raving about them, too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I made an online reservation for the same evening for two couples. We walked right in at the time of the reservation and they took us directly to our table. It was awesome. The service was superb and the food was good. Especially the tequila flights. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I thought the live band was a little too loud for where we were sitting in the back of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy live music, but it was hard to visit at our dinner table without yelling at each other. I will always look on yelp before I go to any restaurant for online reservations. I highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Haley made the entire experience worth the time!  Haley is awesome, personable, professional, passionate, sweet natured, and a complete pleasure to be around.  She explained the food exceptionally well and her compassion for her job and her customers shows in all she does.  Thank you Haley for making this a great evening with us."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this place! The selection on tequila is mind blowing!  The food was great also. I had the fish tacos which only come with one so i had to order more plus additional rice and beans.  I asked for a spicy bloody mary with toppings like olives or celery.. Because thats normally what goes on them. I pretty much got tomato juice with about a pound of pepper in it. Not one olive or any garnish. I didnt even drink it.  The chips and salsa were good though. I would come back to try it again i suppose."}
{"text":"I came here on date night with my boyfriend, and we were blown away! Our server Maria was awesome, she was super nice, and seriously was one of the best servers I've had in a while.  We started off with chips and guacamole, which were amazing... And I also ordered the skinny marg which was HUGE and equally awesome! We ordered the fajitas for two and it was super tasty and a TON of food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience tonight at TQLA. I would come back for sure. The restaurant itself is really nice. I like to contemporary vibe and the relaxed feel of the candle light. Our waiter, Ryan was outstanding and from the other reviews it seems like service can be hit or miss but Ryan has really got it together. First we were served chips and two types of salsa. The chips were just okay but the salsa's were quite good. We had a green avocado and cilantro based salsa and a fire roasted tomato based salsa which is served warm which I found unique and I'm not sure if I like it or not, I haven't decided yet. Our waiter Ryan suggested a few things, the queso being one, the fajita's another. We decided we would try the queso on another visit but went for the fajita's. We got a combo of chicken and steak. They were amazing! Great flavor. If I were to get them again I would probably only get chicken only because the steak had kind of a teriyaki flavor to it which I didn't really think complemented the Mexican flair.   Our waiter also brought out a sample of the habanero salsa since we wanted to try something a little spicier. It is usually $2.50 for the side but he let us try a sample for free because we were on the fence about it. It was great and really added to the fajitas, it was a little sweet and a little spicy I would definitely recommend it if you like sweet heat! I also had a margarita flight, with a blood orange, chamboard and house margarita for $10. It was a little pricey but I like to try out the variety at a new restaurant. I would get the blood orange again but I would come back for happy hour which is 3-7pm Mon-Fri and they also serve half price apps.   Overall good experience. I would definitely come back. It seems as though the consistency can be iffy here so I will write an update on my next visit."}
{"text":"We were there for a group birthday party . First of the waiter didn't even smile or introduce himself when we sat down ! We had to ask for plates and utensil The drinks were terrible their margarita so light has no taste or alcohol Whatsoever ! Food wasn't that impressive  . I had chic burrito and it's so dry ! Salsa was so sour  The whole time the waiter didn't check on us or ask if we need anything else ! M friend didn't have a free dessert for her birthday  It wasn't a pleasant dinner I would never come back here again !!!"}
{"text":"The food & drinks are awesome and because of that I continue to go back and give TQLA another try over & over again. Apparently, I am a slow learner because each time I return the service is horrendous. YES....it is that bad! I have finally been to TQLA for the last time."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...this place was kinda confusing. Never had been here before, this was my first time so decided to check it out with a friend. Knew it was probably Mexican...hence the name tqla, but the outside of the building you would not think so. Walk in and there is a sign that has a list of the bands playing. The Sullivans (Irish band) & some polka band. So right off the bat thought an irish band playing in a mexican restaurant OKAY! Anyways, food tastes like your typical microwaved mexican food & the michelada was very spicy. Not sure i will go back or not."}
{"text":"While in the area I made it a point to stop in for lunch. I'll have to say I really like this place but I had to send my food back after waiting right at 20 mins for it! It wasn't hot and the cheese had just reached its melting point, and served on a cold platter and the food wasn't hot!  I decided not to eat today! Maybe another day!  I did share with manager on duty! Again I can only say if there is a problem or concern ask to speak with a manager!!"}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while but came to watch the GOP debates for January of 2016. Ordered the special and got the fish tacos. They were excellent and a bit on the spicy side which is exactly how I like them. Also ordered up a couple of margaritas and they were top notch.   This place is really worth giving a consideration.  Staff was friendly and really helpful in setting up the TV for the debate.  Granted not every restaurant will be on their mark all the time but I can tell you for the time that we were there they were firing on all cylinders perfectly."}
{"text":"When this restaurant opened we went in there for dinner and I had the worst experience.  After taking a couple of bites of my food, I bit on a 1/2\" bolt and almost broke my tooth.  When brought to the manager's attention, he made light of it with a remark \" we were looking for this bolt all day long\". None of our meals were complimented and we have never been there again. I think I spoke to the owner at that time. Never again!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to do happy hour today and she suggested we try this place out as it's close to her house and something different.  As we were walking up I was happy to see that they have outdoor seating since today was the first day it's been warm out in what feels like FOREVER!  We walked in and a lady kind of walked up to the host stand and said hello but then walked away and didn't say anything else so we kind of looked at each other like \"Uhhhh, I guess that means we just seat ourselves?\"  So we went to the patio and found ourselves a table.  A few minutes later a waitress came over and asked if we wanted to start with some drinks.  We asked if there were menus we could look at first (especially since it was happy hour and we wanted to see what they offered for that) and she said, \"You need menus first?!\"  Now, I know that she was joking and I consider myself to have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor,  BUT...this was only the second sentence she spoke to us and there was no rapport established yet so it rubbed me the wrong way.  Once we got our menus we went straight for the happy hour one since that was the reason we were out after all.  All appetizers were half off, well drinks were $4.50 and beers were $3.  There were other things on there too but those are the only ones I remembered.  I ordered the Carne Asada quesadilla off the appetizer menu and my friend ordered steak and chicken fajitas that the menu advertised as \"The best in town.\"  The food came out in a decent amount of time and the fajitas were sizzling appropriately.  My quesadilla was good, nicely crispy on the outside with a good amount of ingredients on the inside and the cheese was perfectly melted.  The flavor was good and different than your typical quesadilla but nothing about it really wowed me.  My friend liked the fajitas but wasn't really gushing over them.  All in all it was a pretty average experience.  There wasn't really anything terrible about the food or service but nothing that was write home to your mother good either.  I'd go back if I was in the area and craving Mexican food but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I can't believe we are just trying this place. Where do I begin? Happy hour, happy hour, HAPPY HOUR!! My hubby and I had heard that appetizers were half off between 3-7 so we decided it would be a good time to try it out.   First of all, the house margarita ($4.50 on happy hour) was fantastic---not too sweet with a nice kick. They also had a ginger peach margarita on special that was very good too.  For appetizers we enjoyed the crab cakes, calamari, and the fresh guacamole. The crab cakes were out of this world. The sweet corn sauce was the perfect compliment to the crab. I would definitely order this again. We consider ourselves calamari snobs as its one of our favorite apps, and TQLA's gives other restaurants a run for their money. The batter was crisp and light and to our surprise they added fried jalapeños and onions to the basket. It was a huge portion and the spicy sauce and garlicky aioli was a nice touch. Chips and salsa paired with the guacamole was enough to push us over the food coma edge. They serve two salsas, green and roasted tomato. We ordered an additional habanero salsa as well...EPIC! We asked our waitress what the base was because it was deliciously sweet with a nice heat. To our surprise the base is carrot with pineapple, apple and of course the habanero. I could've made a meal on the salsa and tasty guacamole alone.  All in all, I think we found a new place. The restaurant was beautiful, the service was friendly, and the food was excellent. We will be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Went to Happy Hour and tried a number of appetizers. Really bad. Tasted microwaved from frozen. Margaritas were way too sweet. Yuck! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time for brunch. Good menu selection. Make your own Bloody Marys. Regular menu also available."}
{"text":"So Good, I got the Tequilla Burger and loved it.  The Menu is a little too pricey and drinks are good."}
{"text":"This place was busy but we were still able to get a table right away on a Saturday night. We had the guacamole to start and it was good, but the avacados could have been cut a little smaller. We had the chicken fajitas which comes with rice and beans. There is something special about the rice and beans. Can't place my finger on it but far from plain, lots of flavor. The fajitas are great and come with a garlic butter sauce which is amazing. I just dumped it on and they were delicious. Comes with all the fixings, sour cream, cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, all fresh. We finished with the cuatros leches dessert which is like heaven. Loved my meal and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with a girlfriend a few nights ago.  We had 2 appetizers and a tasty beverage.  The service was great and our apps were tasty.  This might be a good place to try for a girls night out."}
{"text":"Sorry to say... I wanted to like this place.  Great patio and curb appeal but its a Jaguar Body with a VW Bug engine.  My wife and I were sat immediately as it was a Tuesday night and not hopping.  A man showed up immediately and took our drink order and identified himself as Joe, the manager.  He quickly disappeared to never show up again.  He evidently did not let our waiter know, nor did he care that we sat without our drinks.  I have to point out that our waiter was excellent but even he as tentative as he was could not save the operation from itself.  (Forgot his name but he must have been 6'8\", great attitude)  We sat next to the display kitchen where we watched countless dish sit at the window.  This place was NOT busy and they could not get the food out to customers in time.   Seemed as if there were at minimum three \"managers\" on duty and they would sit by the window, chat, while the expiditor searched for the appropriate waiter, with evident frustration.  My wife ordered the filet and I the steak tacos.  (Note:  these too sat at the window less than 10 feet from our table till I caught the expiditors eye and had him deliver these to us).  Filet was acceptable... little overcooked but acceptable.  My steak taco's were a joke.  Like someone else mentioned in a review, they must think the customers are stupid.  My taco's were LOADED with iceburg lettuce and MAYBE an ounce of steak in each.  Might as well have been a vegitarian version.  Gringo flavor.....   There is no excuse for this operation to be so confused still.  I believe it opened in October....  Note to TQLA....  Get it together.  You wont last long in Gilbert.  You wont survive just on the bar crowd, food MUST get better and be served hot.  Competition is coming right down the street....  and this group will eat you alive from both perspectives.   Ended with a quattro leche dessert....  No good either.  Think COLD WET BREAD......  Might have been ok had it been warmed through...."}
{"text":"I've been here before.  The chips and salsa are so good, they are dangerous.  The chips are thin and crispy.  The salsa is really fresh with a little heat.  The food is average, but I like this place.  The service is good.  The restaurant is good for couple, business, and large parties.  They have a full bar, so it looks like they do a lot of night life and probably happy hour."}
{"text":"The taco salad was the best we've ever had! They have fun monthly margarita flavors (pumpkin and apple). I tried the pumpkin was delicious.  The beans are also very different and delicious! Our server was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't be mistaken TQLA doesn't have Mexican food exactly. It is called \"New Mexican\" food. While it was pretty delicious I wasn't expecting this. The main difference is that there are a lot healthier choices than a Mexican food restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. The service was excellent. If you are coming here for traditional Mexican food you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Upper scale Mexican food.  We generally stop in for happy hour and partake of the half-price appetizers which are really good. Margaritas are also high quality. Have yet to try a dinner entree."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have fantastic margaritas and great food!! I'm a vegetarian and they have several vegetarian options on the menu, which are super yummy!  I love coming here for brunch with my boyfriend for the Bloody Mary Bar. They also have a great Happy Hour menu. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the time I wish you could leave 1/2 stars.   Id give it 3.5 but not quite 4. It wasn't amazing but was slightly above average.  Went here for brunch with some friends and we had a seat at the bar.  The service was great no complaints there.    The food however was just ok. Not bad not great. I had the steak tacos and I think my overall favorite item was the black beans and the red salsa for the chips.  Is a bit in the pricey side for brunch so I guess I expected more flavor.    They are a tequila type bar so i have yet to sample their variety so can't really rate them on that.    We did order some margaritas and again they weren't bad just your typical margarita.     Overall service was good but experience was just ok."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star I would. My coworker and I had an appalling lunch at TQLA today.  I ordered the salad that is on the lunch menu. The taco salad was supposed to have numerous items in the salad. All that came was meat and lettuce I brought it to the servers attention (who was lacking) and she indicated she would take it off of the bill.  The manager came over and apologized and stated she would \"discount\" the meal. I thanked her for removing the 1/8 of a salad received.  We received the bill and they discounted it $1.50 ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! What a slap in the face, I then went to the server to remind her that she was removing this crap salad. She said the manager said a discount,and wouldn't stand behind what she stated. TQLA  you have LOST my business!!!! I have been here several times and will not return. What a joke, and terrible representation of a business."}
{"text":"Cute and comfortable place. The food is always delicious & the wait staff very good. Have been here for intimate dinners, fun lunches, a meet-up of family, and a party in the private room. Always had the same great experience."}
{"text":"Website says closed at 11. We were turned away at 10. It was National Tequila Day...sad times."}
{"text":"Fajitas were good and salsa has a great kick.  Good atmosphere and the test kitchen menu adds nice variety."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good but food is overpriced and subpar at best. I'd rather go to Macayos. The service wasn't all that great either. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Margaritas were so good. And I really liked the bar tenders. They were super busy but always made sure we had everything we needed to keep our night going. Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant that serves Mexican food!  My wife and I wanted to go out on Saturday to see Johnny Anonymous, and they were performing at this restaurant.   She made the reservation,  and she also joined their free club to get a free appetizer.  So, let the fun begin!  I started the night with a Patron Tequila Flight.  That comes with five shots total, and it was $17.  The first and last shots were palette cleansers, and they both had limes on top of them.  They were a sangrias.  I think the first one was an agave sangria,  and the last one was a bloody mary sangria. Either way, they all went down smoothly, and it made me a little relaxed.  Appetizer: Spicy Crab Cakes.  This item was the most expensive appetizer on the menu, and I wanted to get the most value from the coupon.  It was fantastic!  The plate comes with two crab cakes.  Each one is breaded, and they have diced serranos within each cake.  That gives each bite a nice kick!  The cakes are placed on top of a tortilla strips and tomattila salsa.  Under this heavenly collection is sweet corn cream as a sauce.  It really elevated the dish.  Main Course:  The wife ordered Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon.   It had a green tomatoes, green chiles, mashed potatoes.  She said it was okay.    I ordered choice-of-two fajitas.  I went with carnitas and chicken. Both meats came served with pico de gallo, grilled peppers, carmelized onions, and a whole grilled jalapeño on the side.  The lettuce, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream on a separate plate (I gave it to the wife because she loves guacamole). It came with three tortillas, but the waitress was nice enough to give another package of three.  The tortillas were wrapped inside aluminum foil to keep them warm and fresh.  It tasted fantastic!  The rice and beans were pretty pedestrian;  so, that is why I knocked off a star.  Also, happy hour is only on weekdays;  so, that didn't help as well.  We will come here again because we were both stuffed.  Fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great  atmosphere, drinks we decent, and food is good. However, this place is ridiculously overpriced. There's no way I would ever pay $17 for the small amount of fajitas I received, and they were basic fajitas. The drinks are $11-$14 which is ridiculous too. Nice place and decent food but way overpriced."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in this place. It looks really trendy. That's why I gave the place \"one star\". The drinks and meal were way too expensive and down right awful. I went during (half price drinks) happy hour and had a regular margarita for $4.50. I got an 8oz glass full of ice and at most 4 oz of margarita. I then ordered a vegetable enchilada that came with beans and rice for $10.50. The description sounded great. What arrived were two very small and very soggy blue corn tortillas with 2 tablespoons of diced carrots and corn inside. (I am not exaggerating). It was smothered in a thin white sauce. There was also 1/4 cup of black beans and a half cup of rice on the plate. Another diner had the chicken tortilla soup. It was as thick as paste and very salty. It was awful. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Third strike. They're out! I went in with a friend one late Saturday evening for dinner and ordered the carne asada quesadilla... The very next morning, I woke up running to the bathroom. I had the WORST food poisoning for FOUR days after that!! Salmonella and E. Coli were also suspected from my family and friends. The service was great but I will NEVER step foot in that establishment again. The first two strikes are as follows...  A group of girlfriends and I stopped in for happy hour when they first opened. We ordered our drinks and appetizers around 5pm. We did not get any of our food until 7pm. The waitress was very kind and was the first to mention throughout our wait that the situation was ridiculous. We got out bill around 8pm and they tried charging us full price even though we placed our order during happy hour. The waitress again was helpful and had the manager take care of that but that was all that he was willing to do. He would not discount us for anything else! The waitress said she had sent him over to apologize but he never showed his face. The coward would try to avoid eye contact whenever he was near our table.  Later, co-workers of mine, who live in the area, asked if I had been there. I explained what had happened the first time but hopefully, thought they had stepped up their game after being open for a bit longer. I told them to check it out since it was the atmosphere they were looking for to celebrate a birthday. When they went, the steaks were ordered medium and came out so rare, you sat there chewing and chewing and chewing some more. Blood pooled on the plate. My co-workers wife refers to this place as \"disgusting\". I was so embarrassed that I told them to give it a shot.   They say that third time is a charm and it sure was! I lost some good amount of weight but no restaurant should be open if their food gets people that sick and contains that much bacteria. I can't wait to see how long they get by until health inspections take place."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and is also a great time too. We basically had appetizers and dessert while we listened to the band this time. But the food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best margaritas I've tried. Great place for brunch since they have a Bloody Mary / mimosa bar Sunday mornings. Food is great too. All around great place to hang out and waste a day with friends!"}
{"text":"I was here Friday night and had a great dinner! I sat at the bar and ordered a jalapeño strawberry margarita that the bar tender Jason recommended. It was fantastic!! I would never of ordered that but Jason said it was a specialty of his. I loved the service and the atmosphere was so cool. I highly recommend sitting at the bar thank you Jason for the great recommendation I had a great time. Please sit at the bar and ask for Jason to make you a margarita!"}
{"text":"Brunch is only served on Sundays. The TQLA lunch combo was great. I love their roasted tomato and avocado tomatillo salsas."}
{"text":"So excited to see a fun New Mexican food place in a cute area!  Unfortunately, it was nothing to be excited about. Went during Saturday happy hour and tried 4 appetizers instead of a meal. Chips were greasy and under salted, guacamole tasted like nothing, chicken nachos were cold and boring, I had one bite of the chicken quesadilla and didn't touch it again. But the awful terrible appetizer was their crab cakes. I GOT FOOD POISONING!! I took one bite and sent it back because it was rancid.   I gave one star because our waitress and the bartender were helpful and accommodating. The waitress was sweet and nice.   If TQLA continues with this terrible food it won't be there for very long- which is sad.  As for me and my hubby we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I tried this place with my dad its not bad at all, a little loud sometimes but the food makes up for it, I love the ceviche here it's so good and very well made!"}
{"text":"Happy hour appetizer was good. Drinks were good. Service was close to horrible. They forgot that we ordered food as soon as we sat down and we had to ask for it 10 minutes later. The waiter came by maybe 3 times in the hour we were there, and when he did he was inattentive and got things wrong. We would have ordered more drinks but waited so long for him to even come by we were over it and ready to leave. We even had to say never mind on something we asked for because it had been 20 minutes. Really wanted to love this place but left less than enthusiastic."}
{"text":"My friend and i ordered a bloody mary which was not good. I get these all over and make them at home. Sent it back and they remade and it was still bad. Ordered the fajitas and they were not very good either. We had a party of 5 and nobody was impressed by their meal nor would go back. Nothing tasted authentic. I was disappointed. Waitress was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Read all the mixed reviews but decided to give it a try.  The steak quesadilla was pretty good, it did require the use of the fantastic chimichurri sauce and with some of the habenero sauce it was quite tasty.  The steak enchiladas missed some how, lacked much taste, the rice was ok, the beans lacked any flavor.  The Habenero Chicken really missed, the suace it self was fine but the chicken was cooked without any seasoning at all, just plain chicken covered in sauce.  Once it was salt & peppered and covered in the chimichurri sauce it was ok.  All in all too expensive for tasteless food.  Ambiance was good so maybe I'd go back for drinks but not to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going in there for over a year now and we have not been disappointed once. Please try the seafood enchiladas, they are utterly fantastic. The prices are fair and the atmosphere is great. Heidi is the manager and she seems super nice. My band savoir-faire blues rock will be playing there in the near future. Come see us and have a great meal."}
{"text":"I've been to TQLA 3x, and the crawfish and spinach enchiladas are ridiculously good!  Great motif and service.  Everything that I've tasted is great!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting relatives and we went to TQLA for dinner. I was really impressed! I like the decor and atmosphere, server (didn't catch her name, younger gal with dark hair) was very friendly, patient, and attentive. The two salsas you get with the chips to start are very very good. I got the margarita flight (you can pick 3 flavors to try) with the prickly pear, blood orange, and chambord. All were good but the chambord was DELICIOUS. I'm not huge on tequila but that margarita could change my mind!   For dinner I had the crawfish and spinach enchiladas, which were very very good, the mushroom cream sauce on them is excellent. Very flavorful rice and beans were great too. Boyfriend had chicken enchiladas and gramma/grampa shared the fajitas for two. Everyone was pleased and super stuffed! Look forward to coming here again next time were in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I loovvee this place. The chips are light and crisp - never greasy and their steak/chicken fajitas are rediculously good. If you get a chance to have one of their infused tequila margaritas - do it!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! Kevin the bar tender was fantastic! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place with fun and creative ambience and excellent food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile and was pleasantly surprised. Seems like they've revamped their menu. I had the green chile app as an entree, which was good. Overall not the best Mexican in the area, but definitely better than it use to be. Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time! Great food, great service. Fajitas are to die for. Quest dip and margaritas are yummy too. Rarely Ever is there a wait. I even planned a company party there too. Everyone was happy. I highly recommend them! They even have a good brunch in Sunday."}
{"text":"Pros: clean, homemade everything down to the sweet and sour mix, happy hour 4-7. Indoor and outdoor seating. Delicious food! Lots of flavor and variety. Excellent service. I just can't say enough!  Con: I live too close!!! I will be here everyday :D  Don't miss out !"}
{"text":"Everything was so amazing. I have Been quite a few times now and can't get enough!!' Everyone is so nice and the food is awesome! I am almost afraid to come back because it's all been amazing so far and I don't want to jynx it!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a few weeks ago. I saw pictures of those jumbo margaritas and just haddd to try it out! lol.   They have a cute little outdoor patio with a fire pit so we sat outside since it was beautiful weather at the time. So we started off with the Guacamole.. I loveeee guacamole so I always have to get it when I hit up a new restaurant. It was ehhh... For the entree we ordered the crispy tacos combo. It comes with rice and beans and we just shared it. I think it was a fairly good amount. I enjoyed it.    Last but not least, the drinks! Loved the margaritas! You're talking about maybe $10 a glass. I mean that is the usual price, but imagine jumbo ones. loved it! =)  I thought the food was mediocre. Nothing great. However, I'd probably come back to try their happy hour or just to get the jumbo margaritas. lol. =)"}
{"text":"Here for brunch. Let me just say Brittany our server is awesome! Very attentive. Answered all questions with enthusiasm. Suggestive. Awesome! Will be back just because of her service. The food? The food is good. But the service!!! Great job Brittany!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here!! Close to home, great food and strong drinks!!   My go-to are the barbacoa flautas..mmmm!! A MUST!  My husband always has the green chile burger!! It's definitely something to try!  Also a MUST TRY:  Ceviche  Chicken nachos  Tres leches cake!!    We always have AMAZING SERVICE and AN AMAZING MEAL! The restaurant it self is gorgeous! When the weather is nice, they pull up the doors and it becomes Al fresco dining!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my two girl friends today. They have been many times and recommended we go there since I never been and I'm always up for a new place to try.   The place is super clean and plenty of different types of seating from tables, booths, high stops, and out door. We had a nice half moon booth which was plenty of room for the 3 of us. The decor was not an eye sore, either, very simple and nice lighting.   I arrived early and started off with a chambord margarita. I am familiar with the ones at Ztejas, which I'm obsessed with but these are just as good, larger and even $1 cheaper I believe. Plus, this one gave me a nice buzz, almost the same as the two I get when at the other.   Anyways, girls arrive and they already know that they are both getting the crawfish/spinach enchiladas. I don't do mushrooms even as a sauce so I skipped those and just got the southwestern chicken salad which is featured on the lunch menu. For $10 it was a generous salad and the dressing was perfectly tossed and not over dressed. They loved their meal, and I was happy with mine. Chips and salsa were served free of charge but I wasn't really in the mood for any today so I passed, but they looked good.   Our waitress, who I can't remember the name, was very nice and kept our waters filled and didn't check back on us a million times since we were very deep in girl chat. I appreciate when a waitress knows to keep their distance when we are deep in conversation. Juicy hot topics!   Really enjoyed everything and can't wait to return and try some of the tequila/margarita flights or even the happy hour, was an hour too early, but I didn't know haha   Cheers!   2nd time here: still amazing :-) tried the stuffed grilled shrimp and I think I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Went last week for Book Club- it was actually cool enough to sit out on the patio! Nice atmosphere, GREAT margarita. They don't skimp on the tequila! My chicken queso was a little cold, and so was another entree, but I'm chalking that up to the big group. It was tasty, but I don't know if I'd purposely go back. I like Nandos much more."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance are where tqla wins. The food itself is kind of bull shitty. They just use a lot of filler foods. For example, my ceviche was filled at the bottom completely with cabbage so it was really half the size even though it didn't look it on the outside and my veggie burrito was filled with rice and beans and a little bit of veggies. My Marg was good (house Marg with prickly pear) but again they really try to get you with the fillers bc everything starts out blended on the menu and you have to ask for it to be on the rocks. All in all they have potential but bc of the food I would not return. It feels like getting cheated out of a fair deal."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday last week and experienced the worst service I have ever received. I don't know why, but the waitress avoided our table like the plague. It took forever just to get drinks. We arrived late, after everyone else was done eating, so my friend and I just ordered a quesadilla appetizer to split. We had to ask for plates and silverware... which she forgot and then just gave us some paper cocktail napkins instead. We had also asked for a side of beans to go with the quesadilla. She basically snorted and laughed in our faces and then never brought them out. I understand if perhaps they don't serve beans a la carte (I don't know since we were never offered menus) but there was no explanation given. I have never encountered someone with such a bad attitude at a restaurant before. The other girls said she was like that the whole night. They all left her a bad tip but I think people like that don't understand that's a signal they need to do better next time; instead it just makes the chip on their shoulder get bigger.  I am giving them an extra star since the food was decent and I liked they decor inside. We were out on the patio which was lovely. They had comfy lounge chairs and a fire pit. Its the type of place I would want to hang out and drink Sangria all night. I would definitely return if it weren't for our experience with this waitress. A friend who has been there before said she has had similar issues with another staff member on a separate occasion so its just not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night. Should have been a slow night... And it was but our service REALLY SUCKED!!!! Sara was our server and she had no personality at all. Sara took 30 minutes to get us water and she forgot to put our drink order in. Sad part was she only had two tables. Pathetic!!! Bottom line is if you are in the area I would go to Ra so you're not frustrated! WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were excited about this place and it didn't disappoint.  We moved 2 months ago and have been here 4 times already!  The house margarita is fantastic.  They have a lot of great options for margaritas but we just can't bring ourselves to try something different.  They offer 2 types of salsa for dipping, one is red and served warm the other green. I've never had warm salsa but it's delicious!  The food is always good.  Make sure to check out the test menu, it is at the back of the menu.  It contains items they are considering adding the menu permanently and it contains some gems you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Been a long time since I have written a review but after last nights dinner I felt compelled to share my experience about a place I have driven by for years but had never tried. The food was good, service was excellent and the restaurant (especially the bar & patio) itself allowed to enjoy a great March evening. I ordered the street tacos - Barbacoa, Chicken Tinga, and Fish. I would order all of them again without a doubt. My wife had  carnitas fajitas, our friends ordered stuffed shrimp and carne asada fajitas. All of them were really good. Looking forward to going back and trying some other things on the menu. The General Manager there (Brad) was more than welcoming. We will definitely be back. My only regret is that it has taken me this long to give it a shot!!"}
