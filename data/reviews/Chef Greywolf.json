{"text":"Visited this Chef Grey Wolf food truck on 8/14.  Ordered a falafel sandwich.  It was delish!  Very authentic and fresh.  I had a former co-worker from Israel who would make falafels and these taste exactly the same.  Perfect spice mix and wonderful texture.  The portion was tremendous for the low price.  I visited another truck and wow, chefgreywolf's truck was so much better of a deal and better taste. Even the side of rice is tasty and perfectly cooked. If this truck ever comes back to Independence,  I will be first in line.  Next time I will try the gyro.  The wait was not long for the quality and freshness of the food!  Kudos to the chef on providing a wonderful lunch."}

{"text":"This food truck serves fresh, delicious, flavorful Greek Mediterranean dishes around.  My favorite is simply ordering the salad and gyro meat, no pita.    The gyro meat is he's special blend.  His chicken patties once again his special blend of spices come out tender and delicious.  Best value around use his web site chefgreywolf.com to locate him."}
{"text":"I visited Walnut Wednesday on 6/11 with my two friends. We arrived around 12:30, scoped out the trucks and each decided on our lunch. My two friends each got in line at your truck at 12:45.  I went in another direction and after waiting in line, waiting for my food and a place to sit, I was seated at 1:01. I waited for them. One of the girls came over about 20 minutes later with her gyro. My other friend, who was behind her in line and ordered the exact same thing (a simple gyro)... didn't get her food until 1:39. She waited in line to order for 20 minutes then waited 34 minutes for her food. 54 total minutes standing in front of your truck???!!!!  The whole point of the food truck experience is to provide excellent food for people on the go. Most of the people at Walnut Wednesday are on their lunch break and simply cannot wait an hour to get food. This was unacceptable, as the employees didn't even offer an apology or refund (they did offer her a free drink)  PROS: My friends said the food was good."}
