{"text":"Outstanding Southern Fried Chicken!  Quality chicken, with a flavourful crispy coating. Some of the best I've ever had!  Coleslaw was fresh and uniquely seasoned. Def go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken, so tender and juicy, not overly salty at all but you can tell they brine the chicken. If you take it home throw it back into the oven for a few minutes. It remains crispy and tender after warming up in the oven. I wasn't wowed by the potato salad but the chicken was so good I'm still giving it 5 stars. Next time I'm getting a biscuit instead!"}
{"text":"We had the fried Chicken, corn and bean salad and the biscuits. It was excellent...the chicken was crispy, juicy and best of all Not salty, the salad had just the right amount of heat and the biscuits were made by someone who knew biscuits ( I know cause I make my own). We just completed a road trip and needed something good and fast. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I must say, the chicken is tasty and the biscuits are good. The only reason I don't think I'd go back, are the prices! 6.75 for a malt shake that tastes very similar to a 3.00 Frosty from Wendy's? 1.75 for a cookie? Don't get my wrong everything is delicious but not THAT out of this world. I think I will be sticking to Chicken on the Way and Wendy's."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken--have never had better. Biscuits were also excellent but a tad dry and crumbly and waaaay too expensive! Rotisserie chicken was good, but nothing different from a grocery store rotisserie chicken and definitely not worth the $27.50 price tag (full chicken). Fries were soggy/wimpy and not at all what I would expect from a specialty place like this. So overall, we would definitely return for the fried chicken and would consider the biscuits, if they reduce the whopping $2.50 price tag (per biscuit! )"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying the fried chicken and biscuits. Both were tasty and I enjoyed them. The batter seemed to have a bit of sage or poultry seasoning, was fairly thick, and flavourful. The chicken was moist and I was pleased with the fact that it wasn't greasy. The buttermilk biscuit was perfect. Flaky and fresh. While quite pricey, it may be nice occasional change from Chicken on the Way.   The reason for only 3 stars? The potato-egg salad. It was, well, odd. The pieces of potato were under-cooked and it didn't have any egg at all. The flavour was strange (as another review mentioned with respect to the coleslaw). I NEVER salt my food, but did try salting this salad. It didn't help. I'm not sure what seasoning was used, but it didn't work and was somehow bland yet unpalatable at the same time. The gravy also suffered the same fate.   After tasting the chicken and biscuit, I was not only disappointed by the potato-egg salad and gravy, I was unpleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The chicken was fantastic, fries too salty, prices laughable.   I walked in with a $20 bill not thinking I needed to be especially careful ordering lunch, but blew the budget and had to take items off of my order. $3.00 gravy and a $4.75 bottle of pop got the axe, next was the $2.25 biscuit. At that point the irritation factor got to me and I changed my order from a 3pc to 2pc. The server was very gracious and gave me the 3pc anyway.  The service is great, I just feel sorry for them having to break the news to people when they add up the bill.  It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon today with people all over the place, but the Cluck N Cleaver was empty. I don't think they will be around in a year unless the pricing changes."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delish. The staff is always cheerful. Highly recommended this place"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit. The chicken was extremely moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I felt it had a nice amount of seasoning and a little kick from something on the spicy side but nothing off-putting. The fries were fresh and delicious. I was not personally a fan of the gravy, it's a southern style gravy so a bit on the \"Milky\" and mild side.   The only downside is that there is no where to sit. I assume this is because they would have to provide a washroom if there was, it was awkward eating out of the takeout containers standing at the counter. We live on the other side of the city so we wanted to experience it fresh."}
{"text":"We live in the far south of Calgary so driving all the way up to Cluck N Cleaver for take out chicken is not exactly convenient for us. However, my husband and son were up at SAIT on what was to be CNC's opening day so I begged them to stop and grab our (very late) lunch. There was a bit of a line when they arrived, but it moved quickly and soon they were being driven crazy by the chicken aromas in the car as they drove back home. I greeted them at the door in anticipation, unpacked the cute little pink and orange packaging...and took my photos! How mean is that? Meanwhile...everyone continued drooling in the background!  I was able to finish up the photo shoot quickly and we were all pleasantly surprised to see that the chicken pieces were all still REALLY hot after 40 minutes of driving and picture taking. He bought two three piece dinners, 3 biscuits, gravy, and the corn and bean salad. The chicken was tasty and juicy but not as good as it could be. The fries barely survived the trip south..I think this is more of a take out issue and not sure what can be done about it. One of these days I would like to taste them fresh out of the fryer. The gravy could use more flavour, though I am no expert on 'southern' gravy so maybe it is legit? I loved the salad AND those biscuits were so good that I still dream about them...the next time I visit, I think I will buy a dozen and freeze them to save on travel time and gas. Over all I would definitely visit again. On my list to try next time is the rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Their southern fried chicken is amazing. Cool atmosphere, friendly staff & great location. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had. Large pieces, with crispy batter and moist interior. Also a really big fan of the gravy,  biscuits and rotisserie potatoes. A little more than Chicken On The Way but worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok, this will be short & sweet. (Hahaha sounds kinda like famous last words! @_@) This place is amazing!!! It will probably be super packed & busy when you go, but trust me, it's worth the standing room only wait. Whatever chicken meal or combo or single serving or whole bird you get will be worth it. Also, & this is important: get the gravy!!! It's phenomenal! Use their butter milk biscuits to soak it up, or drink it straight from the cup! Maybe don't actually do that, might be a tad excessive... My one and only criticism (real critique) is that I don't like their coleslaw. :(  The sauce is too thin for my liking, it's not nearly as flavourful or as bright (acidity wise) as I want it to be. And it's a little unpleasant when it drips off the cabbage a Pepto-Bismol pink! But hey, I'd still buy the chicken even if that coleslaw was a mandatory addition to all orders! The chicken and biscuits and gravy is just that good!! Fair warning though, you may never be able to go back to your previous regular fried chicken place after you've had Cluck 'n' Cleaver! Well, now that I've exhausted my allowed exclamation mark use for the year, please try this place out, it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken from a top chef canada winner. When she won top chef I visited Cluck N Cleaver before and really enjoyed it. I saw her on Iron Chef Gauntlet and craved Cluck N Cleaver. I wanted to try their rotisserie chicken and when I got there I was about to order the 1/4 chicken but they said we would have to wait 20-30 min.... but I was hungry now..... So instead, I ordered the Mutha Clucking Sandwich, mostly because of the name but it was a bread chicken, with goat cheese and buffalo sauce topped with veggies. They made the sandwich fresh so it was a 7 min wait.... so i also ordered two cookies: chocolate chip and Skor pecan. The cookies were absolutely AMAZING!!! I highly recommend the Skor Pecan, it was soft and perfect sweetness! Dessert before my meal, WHY NOT!   Now on to the sandwich, It was pretty good! the chicken was juicy, the cheese balanced the spice of the buffalo sauce. The down side to the sandwich was, it was a bit small... maybe because I was very hungry and wanted more :) The fried chicken has a very good spicy to it, it was very different from KFC or Popeye.   Overall, I will come back for the cookie!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Cluck n Cleaver was disappointing. The chicken was salty and there's a spice that they add to the chicken that gives it an off taste. The biscuits were dry and dense, the fries were dry and again salty. Some weird bean salad on the side, didn't even try it. GO EASY ON THE SALT. 2/5 would NOT recommend. Wow chicken beats Cluck n cleaver any day."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in Calgary. Period.  Biscuits and gravy are a must. If looking for a healthier option, rotisserie Chicken to the rescue. You can really taste the garlic and thyme in these birds."}
{"text":"Pretty easy access off 14th. More parking in the back.   Small area to order and wait. No place to eat in.   The lady taking my order never cracked a smile or said a warm greeting. Notta. Hmm. Maybe an off day. But hey we drove 30 min just to try this place a smile and friendly hello would have been nice.   The chicken was delicious! Crispy and wonderful. We ordered 5 piece, 2 biscuits, large fries and a cucumber, radish, tomato salad for 4 of us. This was plenty of food to share for our family. Everyone loved every bite.   We will definitely return because the food is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My new favorite chicken place. I told the gentleman working there that it was my first time here. I think his name was John. He explained options and my son and I decided to share the 5 piece chicken with a side of slaw. I have to say that it was the hottest, crispiest chicken that I've ever had. It was super tasty too. It helped that John was a super friendly guy as well.  I live way down in the deep South part of Calgary, but I have to say it's worth the drive.  Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Tasty chicken at a premium price. Milkshake was good, infused tea was barely flavoured water.  Sides were very pricey but ok.   All in all I might go back if I wanted that type of chicken, likely won't be back often."}
{"text":"Okay I was expecting this place to be overrated.  Southern fried chicken is a way over used name for fried chicken but this place is really good. Tender and tasty SOUTHERN fried chicken. Wow. The biscuits are fantastic and the roasted potatoes are the best part of the meal. Only reason there was four stars instead of five was the creepy looking cool staring at people in the back lol. The food and the front counter service are spot on. Well done guys I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab dinner because we are lazy and fried chicken is delicious.  Got the 5 pieces + 3 biscuits + med fries + med gravy to share. More than enough for 2 people, think we may have had one piece left over. Only thing I would have changed is to get a large gravy. That stuff is like crack sauce it is so good. Chicken has a good coating and was nice and crisp. But honestly the best part is the gravy and biscuits.  Less on stars based on our previous visit and service.  Service is always slightly disorganized there. Little bit of a general tone of disinterest from staff too.  On our previous visit we tried the roast potatoes. They were incredibly disappointing. The potatoes were still so hard I had to microwave them for an additional 5 minutes before they were cooked. I don't think I should pay that much for potatoes just to have to cook them again myself. We have spoken to a couple of people who had exactly the same situation.  This time the fries were good but quite crunchy and a couple were overcooked. Once again it is a lot of money for fries that disappoint.  This is a buyer beware warning on potatoes.Everything else should be bought in plenty and shared with the multitudes.  Love that you can pre-order now so its quicker for pick-up. Plus they have started doing chicken sandwiches which I am looking forward to trying the next time."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was so bad that I felt obligated to write a review to warn others. The fried chicken was hot and juicy but it was SO SALTY.  You can only taste the saltiness but nothing else. Ordered a quarter rotessire chicken and all I got is a leg and thigh. More like a 1/8 of a chicken. It was dry and salty. What a disappointment.."}
{"text":"Dear Calgary, if you are looking for a good fried chicken. This is your place. I love fried chicken and I haven't find anything in calgary so far. Last weekend I went here for the first time. I bought ten pieces of southern fried chicken, medium coleslaw and one biscuits. Let me tell you about this chicken. This one was one the best fried chicken I ever had in my life. Crispy outside and It was so moist inside , sooo flavourful and not too salty. Can't compliment enough.About the Biscuit just Wooow, normally the biscuits are very dry inside. But cluck biscuit is the best. So moist, buttery and yummy.unfortunately coleslaw. It was pretty disappointed. They added too much cumin in the coleslaw and it was so strong. We couldn't able to handle that. So coleslaw was a big no no from my side. Other than that everything is perfect and I will give 4/5. And I'm going back tonight as well"}
{"text":"I got stoked on this place when patrons waiting for their take-out order crowed about it as being the greatest southern-friend chicken.  From my first bite to the end of the meal shared with others I was super bored, and distinctly disappointed. For flavour, it was flat and uninspired: I'd rather have the fatty Chicken on the Way or even the greasy Kentucky Fried fast-food drek.  Like how boring and uninspired can such chicken places get? Not much more! Stay away from this one as it is pricey and distinctly a worker-on-the-way home kind of place. Want much better chicken? Just up the street at the corner of 17 Ave and 14 St. is good tastin' Jamaican jerk chicken and oxtail stew. A much better bet for sure..."}
{"text":"I had heard good reviews so yesterday I went for the 2nd time. The first time we went, we did not stay as we were looking for sit down table service.  Driving home from airport yesterday mid afternoon, I wasn't hungry - just not satisfied. It's Thanksgiving Day, we had Turkey last night with our kids in Victoria.   It's cold, grey & snowy. We are new Empty Nesters & I'm a tad lonely.  Let's stop at Cluck N Cleaver!  They of course had sold out of the whole birds - so I got 5 pieces with a side of potatoes. I also got a coke in a seemingly old fashion bottle. I liked that & felt kind of awesome with my cool coke.  We went home & I ate 3 pieces then cleaned up my wife's bones on her two pieces. (When she was growing up, her family never really taught her how to eat chicken like my 5 older siblings did.) :-).   At $21, it wasn't a cheap snack - but it was gobbly delicious. I look forward to taking my 80 year old Mom next time she is in town. She loves Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Super cute fried chicken take it place opened by a to chef contestant. My only complaint is that we weren't sure where we could park behind the location. There is street parking though if you become confused like us  I'm usually a Korean fried chicken girl but I think I've been converted. The chichen was so crispy but super juicy and full of flavor ask the way through.  There's 2 kinds: Southern fried chicken and Rotisserie. We tried their Southern but so be back for their rotisserie. We also had their buttermilk buscuit. Although when we got there mid afternoon it wasn't fresh out of the oven it was still soft and fluffy.  I'm looking forward to trying their milkshake next time!"}
{"text":"Really tasty fried chicken! I've never had Southwestern fried chicken before so I don't have much compared to, but the one here is definitely good! Flavorful yet not too thick of a batter and moist meat on all pieces, what more can you ask for? BISCUITS! Their buttermilk biscuits is soft, pillowy, milky... still kicking myself for only getting one to try.  The only thing I didn't quite enjoy was how salty the gravy was.  It made the already flavorful chicken more salty then ever so I end up not really using it.  Will definitely go back next time I have a fried chicken craving!"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try Cluck N Cleaver. I placed my order online three hours before I scheduled a pick up. I showed up at exactly the time it was scheduled for. I let them know I was there and was told it would be a few minutes.   After I had waited for 15 minutes I asked how much longer it would be. I was told it would be another 10 minutes. 15 minutes later I was called up for my order and then told they didn't have any coleslaw so could they sub another side.   Once we actually tried the food, I would say it was pretty good. It was just such a disappointing customer service experience. It would have been really nice to have them tell me when I got there that they were that behind and that they were missing an item. Had I known how long the wait would be, I might have made a different choice. Particularly because I had people waiting for me to arrive."}
{"text":"Cluck and Cleaver is the Stephan Curry of Calgary's fried chicken game. Everything on their menu is a three pointer and makes you freak out like a Golden State bench warmer.  The fried chicken is juicy and crunchy. I've made enough fried chicken on my own to know they did everything right from beginning to end: sourcing the best chicken, brining the meat, seasoning and frying it just right. Most places will screw with the process just compromise with short service times and trying to make profit. I didn't mind the price and could have waited hours for this chicken. Also I usually get dark meat pieces and their chicken breast was just as moist. Even as leftovers the CFC is still just as flavourful and juicy!  Their gravy did a Chris Rock mic drop on my tastebuds. It rids me of my nostalgic love of KFC's mystery brown sauce. It's more herby and less msg-y.  Lastly their biscuits should not be ignored...it's soooo buttery and can be eaten itself and definitely can't be shared. Unless you feel like fighting over a piece of biscuit on the street...WORLDSTAR!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I ordered the chicken combo with fries, potatoes and biscuits. The chicken was juicy and good quality, but the seasoning was bland. The fries were crispy and a good portion. The biscuits were incredible, the interior was soft and pulled away like cotton candy.  The second time I bought three packages of \"cold chicken\" (day old), six biscuits, skor cookies and gravy. The chicken when reheated was delicious, still juicy and best of all, the skin was well-seasoned. The gravy was nice and went with the chicken. The biscuits were very hard and dry. All six of them. The cookies were okay.   I'd go back for the cold chicken. Four pieces for $10.50 is a good price."}
{"text":"Oh take out fried chicken, you know your way straight to my heart... but like, in a good for the soul, non-heart-attackey kind of way. But yeah, even though Cluck N Cleaver is definitely a take-out fried (and rotisserie) chicken joint, it really didn't seem all that unhealthy. Does that mean it's healthy? Probably not. But it does mean that it's not even close to as thick or greasy as any of the other fried chicken joints I've been to... Frequent... Practically live at...  So what makes it different? As far as the chicken goes, I... umm, I'm honestly not too sure, but different, it definitely is! It's still coated like the say, Kentucky style chicken you grew up on, but it seems like the coating is both thinner and extra crispy. It's a brilliant combination, really. It's like they manage to give you all the crispy flavour coating the juiciest chicken ever, but they do it in a way that less grease sinks in. It's magical. Other than the chicken, this place is freaking adorable and that definitely set's it apart. It's called the Cluck N Cleaver for crying out loud. That's great! They pretty much take the farm 2 table concept and apply it to a casual takeout chicken joint. It's brilliant!  I also really love their choice of sides and that they have some lighter options. Don't get me wrong, I love non-healthy options, I'm giving 5-stars to a fried chicken joint by the way, but when I've already decided the primary part of my meal is going to be fried chicken, their cilantro lime bean corn salad really helps at some fresh, light flavour and colour to help cut the grease. The potato egg salad is also a really nice compliment that will make you feel full but also not hate yourself when the meal is done. The medium sides are a great size to share between two people. Two of us got the 5-piece fried chicken and two sides. I was epically hungry so we split the chicken 3/2 and the sides 50/50 - it worked out to be the perfect amount of food. If you're grotesquely hungry, you may want to order more."}
{"text":"When my friends asked if I wanted to go to a \"southern fried chicken\" place, of course I can't say no!! There aren't enough quality fried chicken joints up here in Canada, so Cluck n Cleaver was a welcomed treat!  It's small, so be prepared to get takeout, unless you want to chance being able to eat at the counter. The food was so satisfying. The fried chicken was not greasy, just moist and delicious with a crunchy coating. A setback, for me though, is that it was incredibly salty. Equally as delicious was the rotisserie chicken. It was peppery which I enjoyed. For the sides, I was SUPER disappointed that there is no mac n cheese... so I definitely wouldn't call this a \"southern\" fried chicken joint. The buttermilk biscuits were fluffy, and the house-made cookies were definitely worth it!  For sides we enjoyed the potatoes and coleslaw.   The prices I feel are reasonable. We had more than enough to feed 4 adults at it was just under $70 for a 1/2 rotisserie chicken, 5 pc fried chicken, 2 wings (because I love wings), 2 sides, 4 buttermilk biscuits, and 4 cookies (actually we were given 6 but I definitely only paid for 4).   So if you're craving chicken, whether it be fried or rotisserie, check out Cluck N Cleaver."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. Only reason it doesn't receive 5 stars is because I had some fried chicken in New Orleans which may have been the best thing I have ever eaten so it would be rash to give this the same rating. Still good though."}
{"text":"This is place not for sitting. Grab and go service. Rotisserie place serves good juicy chicken. Take a little time to get order or when we visited it did take little bit of time.  Chicken was not bad. It was juicy but not the best. Their biscuits are good. Good to try!"}
{"text":"As someone who worked in a Chicken place many moons ago in his youth (not KFC) It's not very difficult for me to tell instantly the quality of the food in the first bite.  But first, the service. Amazing. Walking through the door we were asked if it was our first time there, and upon discovering this to be true, the young lady gave us a rundown. We learned where it was sourced all the way to specific suggestions on items. 10/10 for service.  Now for the food. I ordered 3 chicken Breasts and a large fries with gravy. It was so nice to discover the clear liquid in the chicken was moisture and not a fat pocket (yes, I'm looking at you KFC)  We'll try the big chicken next time. We live almost across the street so I'm sure the bank account will suffer ha-ha!  Of interest is the imported coca cola from Mexico (They use cane sugar). This product is difficult to come by so if you have always wondered what Coke is SUPPOSED to taste like, grab a bottle.  The store is clean and bright with a full kitchen view. Watch out Calgary chicken shops, there's  a new kid in town!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the second time I have had their chicken, and I am not impressed, certainly not for the price.  When I asked the cashier what she would suggest as a side she said the corn and bean salad, which if I liked cilantro would have been ok, but anyone that knows cilantro knows if you don't like it everything it is in takes like soap, so that was disappointing.  Can't say I will be back, which is sad because the location is so close."}
{"text":"Excellent southern fried chicken, French fries and gravy.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  And, amazing chocolate malt shakes courtesy of foothills creamery.  We arrived right at closing and the staff welcomed us and were eager to serve us.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cluck N Cleaver has the best chicken in Calgary. The staff are great and you'll be in and out in no time even if they're busy. Even quicker if you order online. I crave the southern fried chicken far too often. Just thinking about it while writing this means I'll be picking some up for dinner tonight. The only bad thing about this place is that it's too good, so those will poor impulse control will have trouble managing their caloric intake."}
{"text":"Food was great! We had a milkshake, fries, chicken, biscuit, gravy and coleslaw. Everything tasted good. Atmosphere was adorable when you walk in. It also smells amazing. I would have given 4 or 5 stars but...  We ordered 2 milkshakes online by accident. When we walked in, we told the worker and he said he would reimburse us directly to our credit card. It's been a few weeks now and no refund.   It is a bit pricy and I thought it was still worth the money on special occasions. However, if I'm getting charged for extra shakes, I won't be coming back. Sorry."}
{"text":"After our first visit of enjoying just the fried chicken and biscuit sides, we knew we had to return- next up were to try the sandwiches: The mother clucker is insanely delicious- blue cheese, seasoned chicken, coleslaw goodness.  It is actually quite a large serving but I managed to finish it all as it was so good, like \"to the last drop\" good.  Our eldest little kid had the lil' clucker which better suited his tastes without any heat and blue cheese but still the awesome seasoned chicken. Fries are meh, but since the chicken is so good, no stars were lost. Can't wait to return, this is possibly our family's fav place to fried chicken."}
{"text":"I got the 3 piece with /1 side 12.00. I was excited to try it! The potato salad was great - the chicken was tender but not in love the wig the crust - had a flour taste - olive chicken still wins"}
{"text":"Best fried chkn in the city. Fresh good glty chkn and perfect spice and crisp on the skin. I also like the cold chk they sell. Its my go to comfort food presently. Great service as well. Just hope qlty and pricing doesn't change adversely for customers as the brand and chef get popular."}
{"text":"Went for fried chicken and fries. Fryer for fries wasn't working, so no fries. The chicken was sitting out under a \"heat\" lamp. Got home (5 minutes away) the chicken was cold and the seasoning bland. If you can only get take out at a joint, then the chicken should be hot right from the frier. Fried chicken is all about the batter and if it's cold and under seasoned it's not worth eating. Definitely no better than KFC and at least KFC is hot."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and they never have any chicken cooked! 40 minute wait is ridiculous. Considering that's all they sell. Food is OK, nothing special. Coleslaw mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken! Very nuanced and flavourful seasoning makes it stand out from the rest.  We also ordered a side of fries which were average and a side of biscuits which were quite tasty.  You could tell the gravy was made from chicken as it had great depth of flavour. Finished off with a malt chocolate shake which was to die for.  Great service but no place to sit!"}
{"text":"When a Friends asked whats for dinner and some says they want chicken I thought this place would be a good in and out spot. The chicken sliders at the beer fest that I had a t beer fest were amazing. so off we go. Everything was okay...  The potato were not what I expected  lightly seasoned not really the best finger food  and no dips available like ketchup vinegar and so on. the bean corn salad  was not exciting it should have had a spice kick to it but it was more of an onion kick.  as for the chicken well I'll just let you know thank I have now felt ill for 2 days....."}
{"text":"over priced and over hyped both chicken on the Way and KFC are better value for our recession dollars"}
{"text":"My favourite fried chicken, crispy, hot and delicious! I paired the chicken with a biscuit and the corn salad side. Everything was freshly cooked and steaming hot, we ended up eating everything right in the car because we couldn't wait to get home. A small amount of parking out front but decent street options close by if you're wanting to run in and grab something. Definitely a grab and go not a sit down and eat spot."}
{"text":"I got the 5 piece fried chicken and biscuit, and they were delicious. The chicken pieces were large, juicy and the batter had a bit of a  Memphis spice to it.  The buttermilk biscuit was excellent, so I was a happy and pleased customer."}
{"text":"Cluck N Cleaver saved our brunch date after a disastrous meal at Home and Away.   This was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Their chickens are hormone free, locally sourced and never frozen. They were succulent, and juicy to the bone. The amount of seasoning in the meat and skin was perfect. We didn't finish the side potato salad and had it again later that night. It actually tasted better after the flavors melded together with time.   Cluck N Cleaver blows all other fried chicken joints out of the water. If you ever have a crappy day, fried chicken from Cluck N Cleaver will soothe your belly and heal your soul."}
{"text":"I was expecting something special, but I was somewhat disappointed. The seasoning on the southern fried chicken was a little bland, otherwise it was perfectly enjoyable. But, I've had the same nothing special many times before elsewhere. We wanted fries, but the frier wasn't working, we got rotisserie potatoes instead, they too were just ok.  I hope they get better, maybe I was expecting too much."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I was excited to see a new fried chicken joint open up in my hood! I think this was their third day open, and at 7pm the line up was out the door still. I waited about half an hour to get my food, they were running smoothly as a team but I think not quite prepared for the line ups.  The chicken- it's good. It's also totally different than anything you can find in calgary. They call it \"southern\" but I just got back from a tour of the southern US, and this was not like any fried chicken i've ever had. I'm not saying that in a bad way. Nothing like KFC, church's, Mary Browns, Popeyes or even Willie's. It has a great crispy crust, and a strong fennel flavour. Juicy inside, crispy outside.  The gravy- mild and buttery. Almost too mild, hard to taste it over the breading on the chicken, and it's mild even on fries. I added a good pinch of smoked pepper to it at home to give it a bit more zing.  The fries- home fries, but unlike COTW these are crispy! I love a crispy fry and these are great! Not over salted, just crispy and delicious.  The Biscuits- looked SO good, but my biscuit was a ball of raw dough in the middle :( The outside crust was flakey and delicious especially with honey, such a shame that it was undercooked. I happily chock this up to a few opening week stumbles, and perhaps they were overwhelmed by the lineup of waiting customers.   The other sides looked good, there is a nice selection of veggies and salads.   A bit pricey, 3 pcs, fries, gravy, and a biscuit came to about $20. BUT! These are happy chickens, not sad sorry factory chickens, so when you factor that into the price, it is a pretty good deal. It is definitely a HUGE meal.  I would have given 5 stars, if not for the biscuit. But they are definitely worth a try, even if there is a line up  ***edit***  Tried their rotisserie chicken and it is on point! They use real fresh herbs, whole garlic cloves and fat juicy birds! A bit pricey at $30+ for a whole bird, but at 4 pounds they are 2x+ the size of a safeway chicken, and WAY nicer. They may be known for fried chicken, but the rotisserie is where it is at!"}
{"text":"Cluck n Clever. Catchy name and with lots of referrals. But for those who don't know, they specialize in fried chicken.  Being a fried chicken kinda guy and with the line up accumulating, I had hopes for this place. With the swanky sign and cool decor, I was really digging it.  My crew and I ended up trying 5 pieces of chicken with fries and gravy. Needless to say, it looked really good! With the oil sippin through the box. However, it is nothing special. From what I tasted, it was all delicious, but not enough to comeback. Let's just say they are, jack of all trade but master of none.  It was suprising. I thought the chicken would be tastier, the gravy be thick and savory and the fries to be well seasoned and crispy.  For those who hasn't tried, check it out for yourself and formulate your opinion. I just believe there is a better chicken cook in town."}
{"text":"Oh Dear.... I was so excited to try out Cluck N Cleaver on account of the rave reviews it's been getting, that I actually stopped by after grabbing dinner at Ke Charcoal Sushi and Grill next door. Regrettably my positive experience with Cluck N Cleaver ended at my appreciation of the décor.   I opted for the 2 piece and 1 side meal, which ran me a whopping $10, which was fine because I'm about to have my mind blown by crazy good fried chicken, right?   I was served two pieces of fried chicken that looked like they had been sitting out for a few hours already as opposed to freshly prepared chicken - which would have still been fine if it was delicious. However, the fried chicken not only was absolutely dripping with grease, but the batter was also soaked with grease and the chicken itself was way too salty. The chicken was indeed tender, but because of the saltiness I assume that is because the chicken was brined to hell and back. I didn't even finish the chicken because it was so disappointing.   The side - I picked a corn and bean salad, and this was actually quite good. The flavor balance was right and it was a good resolution to a disappointing meal.   I was actually quite shocked that I just paid $10 for greasy, too-salty fried chicken. I can honestly say I'd rather go to KFC - but for decent fried chicken, there are a ton of better options around (I'm thinking Wow Chicken).  Maybe I just had an off experience, considering the other reviews for this place, but based on my experience I wouldn't feel the urge to go try again."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a long time, based on the reviews here. Living in the deep south it takes some effort to get here, and finally decided to go for a drive today.   Wow was I disappointed, to bad they didn't put the same effort into their product that I made to get there and earn the money to pay for it.......... I arrived shortly after it opened and I had the chicken fries gravy and a biscuit. First disappointment was the gravy, it was nowhere near as good as people on here rave about. The biscuit was the star of the show, it was incredible. The chicken was just so so, I thought quite small especially for the expensive price tag. Fries were better than the typical fast food joints prize but just.   Overall for what I paid, the quality of the food I received, and the time to drive here and back I thought it sucked. These are the types of place I love to support but I will not be back here."}
{"text":"There is just something about their chicken that I really like. I have tried their southern fried and their rotisserie chicken and they are both tasty and really very good. I also love their gravy. They have a good selection of sides and their service is nice and quick."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken- but not from here!! It is sad when you consider KFC chicken to be way better than this.   I ordered 2 fried drumsticks and a breast for myself, a half rotisserie chicken for my fiancé, and then we split a large fries and gravy and two biscuits. His rotisserie chicken was delicious, so were the biscuits, the fries and gravy were OK, but my fried chicken was inedible. It was so salty after one drumstick i dreaded eating the other two pieces and decided against it, and i ended up tossing them. I understand brining your chicken but come on, this is like licking your lips and tasting straight up salt. Ill stick with chicken on the way or kfc i guess..  I think i finished 4 huge glasses of water after this meal."}
{"text":"I tend to be invited to a lot of pot luck at work. At every event there's bound to be fried chicken. But the chicken from Cluck and Cleaver reigns higher and better than any I've ever had.   First off... Not even talking about the chicken yet, the decor is so cute! Love the exterior of this building so much.   I got myself a two piece meal with one side (9.75) and two cookies (\"skor and pecan\" & \"chocolate chip\" 1.75/p); the chicken pieces were much larger then I expected (which is a good thing).   The chicken coating is crispy and thick. There's a distinct spice mix to their coating that I can't put my finger on, but its super addicting. The meat itself is soft and juicy under the skin. I burned my myself trying to bite into it... But it was well worth it.  The handmade buttermilk biscuit... Totally just melts in your mouth. Mmmmm.   Cookies were a good end to the meal. A bit heavy but a great item to share with someone... Or not. Looking forward to trying some of their other sides and a whole bucket of chicken next time!"}
{"text":"Tried the fried chicken and hubby had rotisserie. Biscuits with gravy are deelish!!!  The chicken is good but not great. Crispy crunchy exterior but had a slightly sour taste likely from the buttermilk.  Overall it was tasty but Yum Yum BBQ is still my favourite for fried chicken in Calgary."}
{"text":"In their second day of operations, I got the three piece combo- three pieces of fried chicken (they also have rotisserie chicken) and one side, for which I chose fries but there are several other options. Quite simply the best Southern US style fried chicken I've ever had in Canada- among other things,  this entails a crispy,  rather thick,  highly seasoned breading not all like what you find with karaage or with Korean fried chicken, and then there are classic American sides like beautiful biscuits I cannot wait to try. Delectable. I could, and would he happy to, eat the breading by itself.  There is no seating here,  just a small stand up counter,  do you're probably going to get yours to go."}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews I knew I had to get down to Cluck N Cleaver and give it a try because I'm a big fan of southern fried chicken, and I'd love nothing more than to find a good local source.  First impressions: a small two-space parking lot, but the building and lot are clean and have good signage. The inside is small, but has a nice vibe for the decor. The drink cooler is well stocked with unique options and they have Mexican Coke!  The service was good, greeted as I came in, had the menu explained to me when the guy at the counter learned I was new happy with the service experience.  But of course I was here for the chicken, and sad to say I walked away quite disappointed. I may have come in on a bad shift, but the coating lacked texture (lumpy rather than textured, firm but not crunchy), and while it was well seasoned, it lacked balance in the seasoning and tasted like someone was trying too hard in the spice department. The chicken in other pictures looked better than what I got.  The chicken was quite moist even in the breast piece thanks to what I assume was a decent brining (and not too much brining, the meat still had texture), but either someone again tried to hard to flavor the bring, or the seasoning was having its effect, but the meat itself suffered from the same as the coating, there was just too much going on in an effort to try and throw too much flavor at it.  The gravy suffered the same fate, and the fries were unimpressive with or without it.  I wanted to like the food, because as I said I really want a good southern fried chicken place to get my fix without a few hours flying, but this wasn't it. Service was good, store looked great, but the food won't be bringing me back."}
{"text":"Just popped in for my first 3 piece dinner.  Awesome!  I had the southern fried chicken and it was so juicy (not greasy).  Big difference.  You can really taste the difference in the quality of the chickens they serve. Had the corn and bean salad as a side and it was outstanding.  Once again Nicole and Co. knock it out of the park.  Only down side is there isn't anywhere to sit and eat.  Just drive home fast!!!!"}
{"text":"Super expensive. The chicken was ok, not amazing. Similar style to Chicken on the Way. The potato salad was good. The biscuit and gravy was good. I didn't try the sweets.I didn't realize it was only for take out. I wish it was more affordable. I had 2 pieces of chicken - they gave me a thigh (cheapest part of the bird) and a wing. With the sides it was $18."}
{"text":"Cluck N Cleaver is a breath of fresh air to the world of fried Chicken.  I was looking forward to trying it, and I was not disappointed. This is a take away only place, very nicely done and decorated. I have been there several times, and I go again!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place after I read the reviews. I'm a huge fan of southern fried chicken (being from Georgia and I make some mean chicken myself!) and I'm always on the lookout for new places.  What's with this side of town and their plethora of chicken joints? My favourite, Olive Chicken, is just down the road as is Chicken on the Way. Upon approaching the restaurants I quickly summed up the limited parking area and had to make a fast and loose decision on where to park since it was full. A good sign was all the folks hovering in and around the restaurant. Went in and placed an order for 10 pieces, 3 biscuits, slaw, and a corn n bean salad.  Had to wait longer than most because I made a special order of no thighs.  They were so apologetic about the wait but tried to assure them that it was my doing.  The chicken was very good, maybe a little salty. Very big pieces and the coating had a nice flavour. The slaw was meh and not a winner in my family. The corn n bean salad was superb! The biscuits were alright but, again as a southerner, I was surprised by the sweetness.  Most buttermilk biscuits are not sweet. I am happy that there was a nice choice of unique sides here.  I'm happy to have tried it but the family consensus is we will probably stick with Olive Chicken."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Two Piece Fried Chicken Rotisserie Chicken Poutine Buttermilk Biscuit Chocolate Chip Cookie and Skor Cookie  Following an American trend of fried Chicken as far as the eye can see, journey(wo)man Chef Nicole Gomes bringing her regionally-famous Bird to a brick and mortar home after years of wowing fans at local food events, Cluck n' Cleaver on 14 Street SW proved a fortuitous midday find during my first day in Calgary, an off-hour visit featuring no wait and a menu full of tempting choices that outperform the chains by miles without too great a price-hike.  Touting environmentalist beliefs and a focus on sustainability, the Chickens all Organic and never frozen while packaging is either recyclable or compost-ready, it was from a somewhat sleepy clerk that greetings were offered on arrival, the menu a well-culled affair of fried versus rotisserie, though both can readily be sampled for just $9.75CAD by way of a Golden two-piece combo with a side of roasted Chicken Poutine.  Waiting perhaps ten minutes for fresh-fried Potatoes, a few more patrons entering the standing room only space or taking orders to-go, it was with two clamshells plus two bags in hand that items were unpacked on the wood counter, first bites of the fries and gravy succeeding where so many others fail by way of squeaky Curds from Quebec alongside juicy cubes of dark Meat, the Biscuit unfortunately not as impressive despite good Butter content since it ate more like a Muffin than something layered and flaky.  Moving onward to the fried Bird, a Wing and Thigh each piping hot and crisp without a hint of grease, Gomes' success appears to be derived largely by a rich spice profile awash in Pepper, Sage and something faintly sweet with a crunchiness that almost seems double-battered, the Poultry itself also well-brined and the sort of thing that would go great with a housemade Shake or locally crafted Soda before finishing up with a fresh-baked cookie...or two...on this day featuring Dark Chocolate Chip or one based on Skor Candy Bars with rich Toffee."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken in the city. There is no eat in area here bit the chicken comes out so steaming hot that the 15 min drive to my house has it at the perfect temperature for eating! The breading is crispy but not overwhelming,  and the chicken is moist and tender. The gravy is a must purchase! The biscuits are buttery (you get two as a side with one of the meals). I also really like the rotisserie poutine, but be warned - it can be a meal on its own! I really hope they bring the carrot cake from Top Chef back!"}
{"text":"Cluck N Cleaver.  What can I say?  I am very happy to give up my hard earned money for some good 'ol fried chicken.  However, is the chicken good for the pocket book as well as the stomach?  Is this place a case of the \"Disneyland\" syndrome (visit once and never come back)?  My wife was in town so we decided to try a newer place that she had never tried before since she moved out of Calgary.  I picked up two southern-fried 3-piece meals ($12 per meal).  One meal with fries and the other meal with coleslaw; I added 3 biscuits ($2.50 per biscuit) to the order as well.  It came out to a bit over $33 after tax.  After about a 15-20 minute wait I got my order and went home to feast.  Impressions:  1) Fried chicken pieces were larger than most places.  The meat also tasted better.  I think they are using better quality birds from better farmers; a plus for sure!  When I eat at other places like Olive Chicken or COTW (Chicken on the Way) I can eat 4-5 pieces of chicken.  With Cluck N Cleaver I could only finish 2.  The batter is a bit saltier than my taste.  The chicken overall is less greasy as well.  I ended up not feeling like crap afterwards.  Worth the extra admission?  Sure, but not all the time.  The good thing is I was able to have the leftover piece of lunch the next day and it kept well.  2) Biscuits I wasn't a huge fan of.  They were large and tasted OK but the texture was dry and cold.  On the plus side, they keep well because they probably taste the same after a day or two.  3) Coleslaw was nothing to write home about.  It actually had a weird taste, almost like they put a dash of curry powder in it. I'm not sure what spice it was but it kept bothering me during every bite.  4) Fries weren't that great, a bit soggy after the 5min car ride home.  Nothing special here.  4-star taste, 2-star value = 3 star overall.  I'll try it once more and perhaps get the day old stuff from their fridge.  It's cheaper, probably tastes the same and you don't need to wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch yesterday just after 12:00. There was only one other person ahead of me so I got my order in no time.   I went with the two piece meal. You get two pieces (drum & thigh) of southern fried chicken with a choice of side, which there are many of. I nabbed a biscuit for my side. The biscuit was just your simple biscuit. No cheese, herbs, or other crap that isn't needed. It was really buttery and delicious. I should probably say biscuit a few more times because I don't think I've said biscuit enough in this review yet.   The chicken was hot and fresh and juicy. The skin is super crunchy. Excellent.  Its not a cheap lunch at $14 for the meal with a drink, but its totally worth it.  This is very much a grab and go kind of place as there's no seating, just a small counter you can stand at if you need. You can also call in your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait.  Biscuit."}
{"text":"Seriously... go get some of this. Now. The countless rave reviews on here werent lying! After being dissapointed by a string of new places I've tried recently- this broke that bad streak and I am happy to say it was deee-lish! The chicken is to die for! So crispy on the outside with a spice blend different from anywhere else Ive tried. Not greasy on the inside and just all around perfect! The fries werent anything special above anywhere else really, but they serve as an awesome vehicle to shovel more of that amazing gravy into ones face... so its a win win really."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on opening day. As I am an avid fried chicken lover, I thought there is no way I could pass this up (even though it was day 1 of clean cleaning... oh well). I managed to get in line before a hoard of people came. As much as I wanted to try everything on the menu, I was a bit hesitant as it is a little more expensive then your average fried chicken joint. I decided to get a 3-piece fried chicken combo as well as one of their homemade items (corn and bean salad) and a buttermilk biscuit. I had to wait 15 min as they were preparing a fresh batch. And it was worth it. The breading is crisp and thick (Southern-style) and the chicken is really juicy, especially the white meat. I loved their buttermilk biscuits. It was flakey, buttery and soft on the inside. I was also really surprised by the corn and bean salad, it had this amazing chipotle kick that complemented the subtle lime flavour. Overall, great first impression.   As this place is fairly close to my work, I returned here twice again. I decided to go with fries this time as a side. The chicken again was being freshly made so I had to wait 15 min. The chicken was good again but the breading was a little too thick this time around. The fries were definitely disappointing. I tried them again to see if maybe I got a strange batch, but they were were very soft and floppy both times, not crisp at all. I decided to try their pecan and scor cookie, which is unreal.   They also have rotisserie chicken which I haven't tried, but they charge $20 for a whole bird (pretty pricey for a fast food joint). Overall, I'd give the fried chicken a try. The scor & pecan cookie is also a must."}
{"text":"Excited to hear that a good friend chicken joint was opening up near home. The fried chicken is as good as it gets. Ordered a box of 10 pcs, pieces were pretty huge. A tad bit salty for my taste, but then again i prefer less salt in food. Tried the biscuit and the gravy, the gravy was pretty bland for my taste, could do with a little more seasoning All in all, great fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 rather than a 3 because of missed items and length of wait. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was good, but it still isn't the best I've had in the city.   We ordered from here this past Saturday. There were four adults and one toddler. We ordered the 10 piece southern fried with two extra breasts. The two extra breasts, although only $3 extra, were missing from our order. We also got the rotisserie potatoes, fries, coleslaw, biscuits, and gravy. The potatoes were ok, but nothing special. I find that my roasted potatoes are much tastier. The fries weren't anything special, the coleslaw had too much cumin, the biscuits were delicious and our gravy spilled everywhere, so I didn't get to enjoy any.   When my husband and friend went to pick up our order, they found it to be quite disorganized inside and the staff weren't very helpful. My husband mentioned that he wasn't surprised to not see the extra chicken missing from our order.   I was expecting greater things from this place and I don't think I'll be running back there. There are other chicken places closer to my house that are much tastier."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try this place on Sunday as he was in the mood for some fried chicken.  I tried the lil clucker sandwhich and he had the three piece with fries. My sandwhich was good enough, not somthing I would run back for.  I stoled a couple fries from him and they were okay too.  My. Boyfriend called it well seasoned but I prefer mine with more spice. I'm not 100% sure it was from them but my stomech felt vey unwell the next day. I don't feel like I would ever go back."}
