{"text":"We made a reservation before we head there just to make sure we do get a table when we get there since it's Friday night, but there was no line. My family including 2 children (15, 6) ordered the toma hawk steak which was smaller than I expected so it did't fill us up but the steak was very tender and well seasoned just right for my taste.  Also the grilled romain and salsa came with the steak were so delicious. 
The atmosphere and the service was great. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a work trip and couldn't have been happier with my experience. The staff was extremely friendly, the atmosphere was great and the food was awesome. I had the salmon and calamari and would recommend both. Make sure you check out their cocktail menu. Lots of really creative drinks."}
{"text":"I am sadly going to lower my review of this place. Was amazing. Truly. But the last three visits were not great. Twice we had service issues. Just misunderstandings but it does lessen the experience. Like we called and reserved the round table for a corporate group and they seated us in the bar instead. Was embarrassing as I talked the place up. 

But the real reason is the food has taken a turn. It has become fairly clear that they are buying in things and no longer making everything from scratch. At the pricepoint... Not ok. Food has become ho hum. I'm sad."}
{"text":"We went for dinner at Briggs after a friend raved about her brunch experience. I fell in love with the place when I walked in the door. The decor is perfect (to me, anyway) - rustic, but chic. I'm lusting over the stools at the bar and I love the beat up round tables tucked away in the corners. 

There was four of us, so we decided to work our way through the sharing menu. The Newf's Poutine was fantastic. The fries had a smoky flavour and the lobster was delicious. My personal favourite was the scallops with seared char and vanilla oil. Adding edamame beans to lobster mac & cheese was an interesting, although not unwelcome twist, and the calamari was a solid choice. We went with both the beef short ribs and the braised pork belly. While the beef was good, the pork belly was a home run for me. I really liked the slaw and the sticky maple braise.

The only dish that made me go 'meh' was the potato tic tacs. I understand the lure of trying to dress up tater tots but the harsh reality is that the best ones still come frozen in a bag. It's like trying to use truffle oil on Kraft Dinner. Just appreciate them for what they are, and leave them be.

Overall, a solid first experience. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more stars I would. The food was excellent and the service was even better! I had the lobster mac and cheese and we had a steak as well.  The main reason I'd give this place more than 5 stars is because the manager was very helpful. It was our first time visiting Calgary and we asked our waitress for a few ideas of places to go. She didn't know any but sent her manager over. The manager was great! Despite the fact that the restaurant was packed she took time to talk with us about places that we may like. She suggested a few walking trails, a hike, and directions to the city of Banff. She even wrote the information down for us. 
She made our trip to Canada worth it! We had a wonderful time enjoying Banff. If your in Calgary, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat. The drinks were great as well. Overall, great food, excellent service!"}
{"text":"The best food I had in Toronto....what an excellent find. If you are in the area you should definitely give it a try.

The food was delicious and The owner was super friendly. Completely unpretentious food at very reasonable prices.

The customers in there were also extremely friendly and we had a really good time laughing and chatting away.  It was a fantastic food place ! Definitely going back..."}
{"text":"My wife is from Calgary and luckily I ended up at this restaurant during our visit there. I'm American and never had heard of or tasted poutine (did I spell that right?). The dish at Briggs was amazing. The other poutine I have had since shrinks in comparison. We also tried several other dishes and sandwiches.

The vibe here is perfect. The bar is really well presented. The noise level and decor really makes you feel like you're downtown.

Bottom line is that I can't wait to go to Calgary and eat here again."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were great. Unfortunately, the service was pretty weird. 

Before my group had an opportunity to read the menu, the server tried to convince us he should order our food for us. He called it the 'Briggs experience'. Is this actually a thing? I can't find it mentioned in any other reviews. We thanked him for the suggestion but let him know we'd rather choose our dishes. He continued to push this idea several times after we declined. 

While we were paying, our server starting telling my group about how much he has to tip out, encouraging us to provide him a more generous tip. I found this so distasteful I will probably not return. To be clear - this was not because my group was being stingy. Most of us have worked in the restaurant industry and were tipping between 18-20%. 

If you can endure the service, the food is great - highly recommend the spaetzle and cheese!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to try the brunch at Briggs, especially after a late night. Although recommended, I wasn't sure about Briggs as when I got there on a Saturday morning, it was quite empty except for the tiny patio that was outside. That said, the food was not bad. I had the Classic Breakfast - eggs, ratatouille, served in a cast-iron skillet. It tasted good, and was piping hot. However, it was super greasy. The ratatouille looked (and tasted) like it was soaked in black pepper and oil. Service was pretty good, as our server was very accommodating with the various split bills; but maybe it was due to the size of the restaurant and how few people there were, our server did not come back often to check in on us, offer coffee/tea/water refills, etc. Service could definitely improve. Overall, it's worth a try, but I'm not sure I would necessarily go back for brunch again. I will, however, try dinner at another time."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times now for social gatherings and food is ok. Sub par for the cost but ambience and space is good for larger crowds"}
{"text":"Service was great, the waitstaff are friendly and attentive. The Arctic char with barley risotto was the most delicious!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing mixed reviews but I finally went and I enjoyed everything I had.  Would go try again.  Loved the \"Shared items\""}
{"text":"From beginning to end, my first experience at Briggs, on a busy Saturday with no reservations (!) , was fantastic.
We were greeted by a friendly lady who seated my boyfriend and I  at the bar, introduced us to the bartender Colin, and let us know when a table came up we would be notified.
Colin created the cocktail menu and launched into a brief history on bitters when I asked him what they were. I chose the Victoria Park Rickety, which had celery bitters, soda, fresh lime, and Apple brandy. It was so refreshing and light, despite my hesitance with it having bitters in it. We were approached 20 min later by a hostess letting us know a table had opened, but decided to stay put at the bar. Since it's loud with music and chatter, it was easier to hear each other where we were. We ordered a bunch of small plates:
Hearty flatbread, deviled eggs, paella, green beans and the grilled cauliflower. 
I'm sure they will change the menu frequently, so I'll just say, despite offering items on the slightly pricier side, we enjoyed everything thoroughly. 
Lick the plate clean, kind of thoroughly.
I recommend everyone try the cauliflower. I could have eaten it by the bushel. It's coated with a light curry oil that isn't overly spicy, and is to die for.
The service throughout was prompt and very friendly, which is impressive at such a large restaurant. I sadly, always expect to be waiting when a place is jam packed, but I was proven wrong!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is pretty good. I'm very displeased with how small the portion sizes are. I had the lobster Mac and cheese and it was the size of a cereal bowl. As an $18 entree, I expected more. My friends orders were the same. Even our appetizers ( that specifically say to share on the menu ) were tiny."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional and cocktails are top notch and show craftsmanship and care! Would recommend to try."}
{"text":"I am hoping that this establishment welcomes a little constructive criticism because I am really rooting for them to make it - as unfortunately they have some pretty stiff competition on the same block. First off- I tip my hat to the service as it was excellent. The staff is very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful if you are like me and appreciate an entrée suggestion and the perfect wine to pair with it. Also, they are very friendly, attentive and in our case quite humorous. The ambiance is just right - modern and stylish without being pretentious. And a menu that sounds so mouthwatering that it leaves one wondering, \"What in the world should I have?! So many delicious choices.\" Oh! And before I forget, I should add an impressive selection of generous sharing plates. How's that for a rising action? However, our table was disappointed that the climax of this food story was anticlimactic. Remember how I said that when you read the menu the food sounds so mouthwatering? Well, it was, how I like to say, \"Just meh.\" Alot of hype for poor execution of the actual food itself. I was okay with my entrée of the Skuna Bay Salmon (carrot ginger butter, spinach & barley risotto) but my palette felt underwhelmed by it. The risotto was the highlight of the dish- not the actual salmon itself. And at their price, the entire plate should have sang. I also got a chance to taste the Bone In Pork Belly and with the description of a maple braise one would think it would be sweet - but Holy Moly! Was it ever salty! Couldn't even taste the maple. And the guest sitting across from us also had the same complaint for the same dish! And even worse, his was cold to the touch as he vocalized it and I watched the look of displeasure on his face as he literally touched the pork after not immediately trusting his taste-buds after his first bite. He was probably like me, wishing it to be better. Seemed the general consensus all around when a table does the after-dinner-review and asks the inevitable question, \"How was your food?\", everyone had the same answer, \"It was...alright.\" Yikes! That '...' will get you every time! And we were celebrating a birthday - so there were 17 of us this time. Another plus for the staff, they were hospitable and extremely organized when it came time to settle up. Honestly, it was only due to the service why I feel like I want to give it a second chance. But forget the 'Three Strikes You're Out' rule. If I leave there feeling like again it was \"Just meh.\" I will just continue to go a few 
doors down the block."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Best burger in town: juicy and steeped in beefy
flavour. Roasted chicken is a must try as well. Deviled eggs are delicious. The house salad is always cold, fresh and one of the best in town. Good bar. Good people. Briggs raises the bar for casual dining in Calgary. This is where you should bring friends from out of town."}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant's atmosphere is good. My friend and i ordered three meals. I've uploaded the photos."}
{"text":"I started out with Newf Poutine and it was excellent! The fries were golden and crisp even after soaking in gravy and melted cheese. The only thing wrong with it is that they didn't have enough lobster. 

I ordered a medium rare sirloin steak and split that with my friend who ordered a Beef Short Rib. We wanted to get the best of both worlds by ordering both entrees and sharing, but honestly the Beef Short Rib is the more memorable entree. The sirloin steak was decent, and came with a side of fries. It wasn't anything amazing, and was more medium than medium rare. But the beef short rib was absolutely amazing and tender! I highly recommend getting the beef short rib!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a night from BC and made reservations for dinner at 8:30. Upon arrival we had our drink order taken, which took 15 minutes until we finally received them, in a rather empty restaurant on a Sunday night. My beer could have been a lot colder, and as we sat there waiting for our drinks and growing impatient, we were offered a complimentary walnut/goat cheese flatbread, which was originally a mistake made by the kitchen staff. It was tasteless, over cooked, and overall disappointing. If you asked me how it was, well, it was free. We ordered the paella to start, which had zero hints of saffron, the squid and shrimp had the consistency of a rubber band, and had enough salt to pickle a cucumber. We decided to leave after our appetizer and go to a restaurant we are familiar with, after being presented with an incorrect bill, the manager asked if we were disappointed while we were paying the bill and instead of trying to correct the situation, she was defending the very sub-par food and service that we were given. There was a reason the restaurant was less than half full on a busy downtown street, I wouldn't recommend Briggs to anyone. The location and decor are great, but the poor service and food far outweigh the aesthetics."}
{"text":"I visited Briggs while on holiday in Calgary. I had the blue cheese tart and Brussels sprouts. My sister got the mushroom ravioli. Everything was incredible. The tart is light in texture yet rich in flavor and the Brussels sprouts are incredible, they demonstrate that bacon really does make everything better. The mushroom ravioli was good and hearty, excellent winter dish. Conveniently, there's a lot of winter in Calgary so make sure to try it 

Briggs has specialty drinks--I recommend the Briggs old fashioned. The bar tender Scott was new but very accommodating and pretty cute too;) definitely enjoyed the service. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Terrific. If you like lobster rolls, get one. It might be the best I've ever had. My friend got the Halibut sandwich, and loved it as well. Jalapeño garlic sauce. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"Briggs is one of my \"go-to\" restaurants. Anything that comes out of that magic oven of theirs is delicious. They have an amazing happy hour now with drink specials and free Canapés...yep, FREE. Decent little patio and great service. P.s. try their Strawberry Pisco Sour - my fave cocktail in the CITY."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quality ingredients, big flavors, and plenty of options for sharing Briggs is a great choice! Almost everything on the menu is made to share, so you can try a bit of everything. Their potato tic-tacs are addictive in all the right ways!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened today as other reviews are good but first of all the potatoe pancakes were inedible, a gooey sloppy mess and burnt on the outside. They were disgusting to look at. Size portions were all over the place. 2 very small thin pancakes that would haven enough for a toddler not as a regular menu item. No one ever came to offer a refill of coffee but we were offered lots of tap water. 
I won't be back but maybe an off day."}
{"text":"We found the bar on the Yelp and so we came here for a brave try. First we've ordered the lobster poutine, it made with the fresh materials, the sauce was really good. But unfortunately the fries has been over cooked that made the cover of the fries became black. The curry chicken tasted tender and delicious also with thousands leaves greens in it and that was really a portion! Then at last it came with the dessert, I followed the recommend from our table server, that is 'White Chocolate Mousse'. You may should have try the dessert, as its fine and smooth top. The service here is outstanding.  I like the environment with the warm light everywhere here."}
{"text":"I came to Briggs last week with my friend. I've been dying to try it for quite some time as their chef Xavier Lacaze was on Top Chef Canada and made it pretty far. The space is really nice. I love the modern look with the wood paneling, very simple yet rustic. Our server was fantastic. He was friendly and explained the menu in great detail. On his recommendation, I decided to try the Lobster Poutine. Oh lord, it was amazing. The fries were crispy and well cooked, the bechamel sauce was nice and creamy and the lobster was a great touch. My friend had the Hanger Steak, which looked fabulous. We had the apple tart for dessert and it was not overly sweet, which I liked, and the apples were nice and fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food
Great service

I went with the Josper Wings and the Chicken Pot Pie. Both were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere...  everything was outstanding!!  

Right from the start our server Tony was very helpful, recommending great menu items, and answering any questions that we had.  We started off with two speciality drinks (dark + old fashioned and greg's marg) matched with the Ratatouille + Chips.  After our starter, and when we thought things couldn't get much better, out came our entrees.  The 8\" Beef Short Rib is what food dreams are made of - and if you are in the mood for a good burger, look no further than 100% Chuck Burger, two patties covered in cheese, with the add in grilled mushrooms tucked neatly between.  Tony did a fabulous job at paring a perfect Malbec to the Short Rib.  To top of the evening, we finished with the Lemon Pie - the perfect combination of just enough lemony taste and meringue.  100% across the board!!  Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Food was delicious, ambiance was great and service was extraordinary. We could not have been more pleased on how our night went and will definitely be coming back. It's a bit on the pricey side so probably not an everyday place but great for a nice meal on a Saturday night. Kudos to the owners... You seem to know what you're doing and have great staff to support you."}
{"text":"Visting Calgary for the weekend and a friend suggested trying Briggs. Upon arriving the hostess, servers and supervisor greeted us and started cracking jokes and immediately i knew this was going to be a good place. The decor was very trendy, the atmosphere was enjoyable and they had the playoff game on a couple screens. The food was quick and the server was excellent. I had the gnocchi pasta and it was amazing! First time I've ever tried it and will definitely start looking for this meal at other restaurants. Others had the Chuck burger which looked amazing and they really enjoyed. The price was reasonable, $98.xx for the four of us. Very fair for a dinner downtown Calgary on a Saturday night. Will definitely be back. Please let me know if this review was useful. I appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Everything is good on a sunny patio with bird sounds instead of angry monotonous hip hop as background. Based on the recommendation of a friend I took 2 friends for Sunday brunch, and ordered the short rib gnocchi. The short ribs melted in my mouth. My companions enjoyed their waffles and crabmeat dishes, all nicely served. Good to see different brunch menu items. That lobster poutine was tempting"}
{"text":"Brand new place that opened yesterday for a soft opening.  The chef either won Top Chef Canada or was a top contender or something. The menu is packed with Canadian classics with a bit of a French twist (which is still Canadian I guess).  I wanted to try everything on the menu it all looked so damn good.  I ended up trying the calamari and the lobster ravioli...both were awesome and the ravioli was made fresh with huge chunks of lobster inside.  The calamari was fresh as can be and lightly breaded (good sign in my opinion).  

The other people at my table had chicken wings (made in their crazy-expensive Josper Hardwood Charcoal Oven, imported from Spain), the halibut sandwich, lobster poutine, and a prosciutto flatbread.  Everyone raved about their food and the poutine was especially good because they use special potatoes and cheese curds from Quebec (Kenebec maybe?)   The halibut was very fresh and perfectly cooked (a bit oily but still delicious) and the chicken wings were nicely cooked (crispy but meaty) so there were no complaints anywhere.

It's located directly under Japanese Village (assah) and the place is kind of a rustic/modern bar and grill type of atmosphere.  Waitresses were friendly and on-the-ball and the GM came over to make sure that we were satisfied with everything.  All in all I hope this place doesn't get too popular because I'll definitely be heading back as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was friendly and fast. The food was delicious too. I would come here again"}
{"text":"What a great place with friendly servers.  Briggs burger is probably one of my fav's in Calgary for sure and those french fries are always cooked so perfectly. This place is great for small or larger groups.  Definitely recommend Briggs. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable pricing, fun atmosphere and great service!  Was in the private room and did the group share experience."}
{"text":"Good date night place. My husband thinks its the best burger in town! I like the small plates and veggie options.

I recommend  getting a reservation!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a sunny weekday in late September to find their patio was still open - what a bonus! A great little spot in the sun made us feel as though it were still summer.

Service was great, cocktails delicious (and decently priced) and the food was good too. They easily accommodated food allergy issues.

Only gave it 4/5 as the prices are quite high for the amount of food you get. I ordered the halibut sandwich, which tasted amazing but the piece of fish was very small, barely covered half the bun! There was a very \"healthy\" portion of delicious fries to go along with it though."}
{"text":"I've been to Briggs on numerous occasions so I can honestly say I really enjoy it here. I seem to veer towards pasta on any menu so it's not a surprise that my two favourite dishes here are the lobster ravioli (they use won ton wrappers instead of traditional pasta) and their lobster mac and cheese. You can never go wrong with scallops in my eyes (which is served on a bed of leeks), and the roasted cauliflower quite unique (curry oil gives it a nice flavour). 

Make room for dessert because the Summer MLF (fresh strawberries and vanilla custard sandwiched between puff pastries) is worth the trip here alone!"}
{"text":"Briggs - what a great place. I've been here twice now...once for lunch with one person and for dinner with 6 others.

Food - something for everyone for sure. Great flavours and neat things you dont see elsewhere like deviled eggs (so good). If you are part of a group, you can customize kind of a sharing/tasting menu based on hunger levels and budget. This is a great way to try many things. We had an almost vegetarian in our group and she didn't go hungry - they made sure of it. Some highlights included poutine, the salmon, the meat dishes...oh it was all good. They also had some unique, cool cocktails. Everything was reasonably priced too, in my opinion.

The only downside, which has been mentioned, is how loud it gets. Now for our group we scored the glassed in private room. That made all the difference in being able to talk and be heard, and also gave us a view of part of the kitchen. Very cool. But elsewhere in the place it was deafening -  just from other patrons talking.

I'll be back for sure to try out some of the dishes I didnt get to try! I just might pick slightly off hours to do so if I plan on talking to my dining companion :)"}
{"text":"I must admit that I've only had the appetizers here on all three of my visits. But they're so good that I would rather have an appy buffet an share with friends family style than order my own meal. Portions could be a tad bigger but still very satisfying. Great place to go and hang out and indulge your munchies, would happily return again."}
{"text":"I met 5 friends here at 8pm on a Saturday night, and they don't take reservations, so it was a bit of a wait (which we expected). The food was great. We started with the wings (ORDER THE WINGS!!!) I ordered the twisted BLT. It was good. I got mine with fries. It went down good with my beer. The service was really good too. Our water was constantly full, I never had to wait long for my beer refills. I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great place for more than just a dinner for 2. Really lively with lots going on especially on a Saturday night....but that's what you want in a restaurant. The food was really good and tasty but really if you have anything that is seasoned well and has loads of butter on it, its bound to taste good! Tomahawk Chop and mushroom ravioli were my favs, oh and the brussel sprouts too! Go try it...its pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"You know what, this place is cool.

Neat atmosphere mixed with good, hearty non-traditional takes on traditional meals means - if you're looking to step outside the burger box -  you'll be happy here.

Good bar selection, inviting friendly staff in a perfectly central location, win.

T."}
{"text":"After 3 days in Calgary, I was beginning to give up on quality food here.  Finally, I decided to try Briggs.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  The smoked wings were great.  That smoky, sweet, spicy, charred exterior just kept me wanting more.  My Lobster Spatz 'n cheese looked small when it arrived at the table, I was ready to complain.  However, it was packed in there and pretty dense.  I couldn't even quite finish it all. The lobster was cooked perfectly and added just the right touch to the mac n cheese underneith.  My gf go the lettuce wraps and absolutely loved them.  I would like to thanks Briggs Kitchen for allowing me to leave Calgary on a happy stomach."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love going to Briggs Kitchen . They have friendly staff and they are extremely attentive. Even the hostess comes around to clear tables or bring water. There is none of the pretentiousness that you find at most restaurants of this caliber in the city.

I'd recommend the restaurant on the service alone, but with the quality of the food, this place is a sure bet!! Great food, amazing service at an affordable price! This place is A1!

FYI try the wings if you go in the evening and the French toast or perogie platter if you pop in for weekend brunch!

Our new favourite place in the city!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I loved the menu cleverly disguised as a cutlery wrap. We got our first round of drinks in a  timely manner and our server gave us a great menu tour with his recommendations (in his made-for-radio voice). We chose a caesar salad, the seared broccoli, the featured pasta and a bottle of wine. All was delicious.

I'd like to give 4.5 stars because I feel like 5 implies THE BEST PLACE EVER, and I wouldn't go that far, but I have nothing to complain about and we really enjoyed our time at Briggs."}
{"text":"TL:DR - Great atmosphere, great service and interesting food. I'll definitely be back. 

They have a variety of clever cocktails, the Briggs old fashioned was probably my fav. We had wings and a few plates to share. Walked away full and happy."}
{"text":"It's been a year since my last review so I thought I'd sing the praises of it once more, since I'm still a frequent visitor. I've worked my way through most of the menu, finally pacing myself with the skill of a seasoned foodie that allows me to sample the desserts. All of Briggs desserts are amazing, particularly the chocolate lava cake and the lemon tart (which has lemon sorbet hidden inside the meringue FYI!). My boss and I had lunch here last week and ordered the house salad (amazing!) and the flatbread (fried egg on top!) as well as the calamari (giant squid pieces!!). Now we're hooked and tempted to make it a regular Friday thing. Service is always top notch and space is a hipster paradise. Briggs & Bridget 4eva."}
{"text":"I went to Briggs K+B last weekend and I had an amazing evening. There where three things that made it such an enjoyable experience.

1: The service was fantastic especially the man that waited on us. I am afraid I can not recall his name but I do remember he was Brazilian. He was very nice, funny and had some amazing recommendations of what to eat and drink.

2: The food was splendid. Juicy, flavourful and their buns for their burgers and sliders are homemade and very tasty. Everything from aps to dessert was spectacular!

3: And they have an amazing patio. It's shady but not cold since they have heaters. I would say that Briggs patio is one of the best in Calgary.


So in conclusion Briggs K+B is an amazing experience from staff to food and seating. I would deeply recommend that if you are in the area that you go and check it out!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings regarding this restaurant. As far as starters go, ours fell flat. Flatbread lacked ingredients, was room temperature and was very boring. Also tried the cauliflower and it was not good. It tasted like someone had just started the barbecue and put it in without the starter burning off. Left a horrible taste in my mouth. But my friend liked it so go figure! Anyways, definitely not my thing. Ordered the wings, which were okay, but they almost tasted over smoked. 

Things changed, however, when my entree arrived. I had the pasta special, which was a tagliatelle pasta, with a cream sauce and it was fantastic! I had quite a bit left over and took leftovers home and shared that evening for dinner and hubby totally enjoyed!  I would go back just to try another pasta dish. I see they also have brisket sliders so I would like to give those a try. 

Loved the atmosphere!  Loud and lively!  Service was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner one night and I'm not sure if it was just that I had different expectations for this place or if we just ordered the wrong dishes, but it was only okay. 

It's pretty dark inside and pretty loud, not sure if I'd really recommend coming with a date. I had the crispy halibut sandwich, the halibut itself was yummy but I found the tartar sauce to be way too tart. My boyfriend had the paella, which wasn't too much to write home about. Our server was nice though, which was a plus and I enjoyed my cocktail.

I wouldn't be opposed to coming back, especially because the tomahawk steak seems super cool, but at $99 it felt a little steep at the time."}
{"text":"The Brigg's Quad Monster is not on the menu. If you want a burger.deserve a burger or just need a burger. Order any combination of great toppings and number of patties.you feel the day requires. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best Burger in Calgary. Nuff said.

PS
There were short rib tacos devoured on the plate beside me that were totally worth getting stuffed face on."}
{"text":"I was out shopping when it struck... the hunger monster. It started to lightly growl, then the roaring began... this is when my friend and I made a decision to try out Briggs. 

We arrived around 6pm and were sat right away, which was nice. I am not sure who our server was because we had so many people attending to us but this meant that we were never without water or drinks. (Positive points granted!)

After some careful consideration of the many delicious menu items we went with the seared scallops, roasted cauliflower, beets and the sausage platter. 

I was very impressed with the combinations of each. Mostly all had ingredients that I normally did not associate with each other but they were very complimentary.

Pricing was much lower than I thought it would be as well especially for how delicious all the food was, I will be coming back for sure to try some more items!!"}
{"text":"A lovely place! We stopped in here for lunch and were very impressed. My first drink was the Rosemary & Jane - a gin take on a pisco sour - it was delicious! We started with the lobster poutine, which easily fed four of us, and was very good. THEN we ordered the Weekend Punch. O.M.G. it was SO delicious. The punch is a great order for four people as well. Between us, we had the angel hair pasta, Twisted BLT, and the halibut sandwich. They were all delicious. I especially loved the egg bun on the halibut sandwich, the pesto on the pasta, and the crispy chicken on the BLT. We had wonderful, friendly service as well, which made the whole experience that much better! Overall, I would highly recommend Briggs. : )"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! I barely eat meat, but burgers in Briggs are simply delicious!

Service and ambiance are really good and the noise level is not loud at all."}
{"text":"Calgary has a lot of great restaurants and this is already one of the best. Unique, tasty food that's perfectly prepared, a great staff and a really fun environment. Xavier is cooking up some amazing dishes (like deviled eggs) and if you're really hungry try the Tomahawk!! It's almost always busy so get there early. Weekend brunch is a really nice treat! Brunch, lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed in Briggs."}
{"text":"Made reservations here last minute for dinner with a coworker. Staff were friendly & knowledgable. Service was quick and the food fantastic! I got the lobster mac n cheese and the green beans, both 5/5! Mac n cheese was quite rich; I'd recommend splitting it with another entree or be prepared for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Out for a walk and decided to stop to look at the menu. Did not even know Briggs was there.
Great selection of clever recipes. Awesome short ribs! Highly recommended. Great deserts. Friendly prompt service. Reasonable prices. I will go back."}
{"text":"Service as phenomenonal and so was the food. Got the cheese fondue with focaccia bread to start and I got the shirt rib while my girlfriend got the crab and gnocchi. Both were fantastic and filling."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I hit up Briggs for brunch one day, and we were quite pleased!

The space is very much like a Craft/National/Midtown. Think rustic, open ceilings, etc. Yawn. Okay, lets move on from that. Oh but they do have nice chairs and stuff. 

Our server was a jovial, funny guy who almost talked a bit too much, but that kept me giggling. He got us coffee, water, etc on time and was on the ball.

We ordered the breakfast perogies and the corn flakes crusted french toast to share. Both were SO GOOD! The perogies came in a skillet, and it was a very large portion. The french toast was amazing too! Crispy on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside. Perfect!!

I will definitely visit Briggs again for lunch / dinner. This was a great first experience :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by Briggs K&B for a couple of quick cocktails and appetizer. The cocktails were creative and interesting. We managed to sample:
- Strawberry Pisco Sour (my fav); 
- Barbara M (a bourbon with strawberry and rhubarb); 
- Victoria Park Rickey (odd - celery bitters with calvados? Not sure about this one)
- Countess Seville (an Earl Grey and gin mixture - nice, different)

We shared the Humbolt Calamari. Our server explained that rather than rings, it had been cut into strips and marinated in buttermilk overnight.  It was fried with a very  light tempura batter and served with tomato aioli. This calamari was so tender it almost melted. I would order this again any time. It was some of the best calamari I've had in a long time.

It was quiet night, so they were not very busy. The service was friendly and informative without being imposing due to boredom. I wasn't a fan of the décor. It was pretty boring with a touch of west coast. I was disappointed to see the old Cannery Row space wasn't made fabulous.  But décor is so low on my list of priorities so that it won't deter me from going back soon!"}
{"text":"2 people walked into a bar, the first one hit his head and the second went straight to the kitchen to do the dishes. 3 stars"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. The reason for 4 stars vs 5 is the cocktails. There one of two old fashions that actually had bourbon was not good at all. They didn't have mint so they couldn't make a mint julep or mojito & no ginger beer for Moscow mules. However the poutine fries were to die for. The skillet mushrooms were great. The sliders were very flavorful. Great food. Have wine."}
{"text":"Service is good and very personable.
I had the paella and it was unfortunately overcooked and dry (maybe intentionally) so it did not reminded me of a good Spanish paella on flavour or texture. 
My friend had the short rib, it was good though the hash brown was way too salty. Maybe just a bad night for the chef... I'd try another place in the future"}
{"text":"Went to Briggs again recently for a birthday party. 

We were a pretty big group, but the waitress had no issues splitting bills for us. All she asked is that if we moved around we gave her the number she had assigned us so we got a correct bill. Easy!

People had ordered at different times so food came out as such. Got to see what everyone else ordered and all looked pretty good. The Boy and I were among the last to order as we just couldn't decide. 

Started with 2x Smoked Brisket Slider ($4 each) which was just enough to tide us over until main meals. Mainly because they tasted so delicious and we were pretty starving by that stage. Plan was to share mains.

I got the Rock Crab & Ricotta Gnocchi that came with lobster cream, pea shoots, parmesan ($19). Good and rich without being too much. The dish was filling and enjoyed every mouthful. The Boy agreed and couldn't eat his share fast enough.

The Boy decided to treat himself to 6oz Hanger Steak with cream crushed potatoes, onion gravy, smoked mushrooms ($25). He ordered it med-rare. When it came it was fully rare and not even warmed through. Let the server know who immediately took it back and had it redone for him. Second go around it was still super rare. She waited for him to check, so was on hand to take it straight back. 3rd time is the charm and it was perfect this go around.

We have had steak there before so guessing there was someone new in the kitchen. The Boy is a chef so has patience when it comes to this - all depending how a restaurant handles themselves. We were blown away. The waitress was ever courteous and pleasant, very responsive, never made us feel like we were a bother or wasting her time. Love that she waited around to check everything was ok without rushing off.

This incident could have sent our meal in the other direction, but instead shot them up to 5-stars. I am sorry to say I dont remember our waitresses name but she did an exceptional job. Thank you to her and the management in how they handled it.

And because we are gluttons we tasted everyone's dessert too. Chocolate dessert was the winner.

We will definitely be back, and next time would love to try brunch."}
{"text":"We decided to meet here as a group for a birthday dinner after hearing some good reviews.  I was curious to check out this restaurant!

Atmosphere:  4/5  Overall a casual and cool atmosphere with some uniqueness to the decor.  There is an open kitchen with some open fires; long wooden tables for our larger group.  The restaurant is also separated into another section to the other side and there is a special group function room separated by glass... in case the volume gets a little loud in the main dining area.  Overall good vibe for a casual group dinner / get together; the volume did become a little loud for conversation though.

Food: 4/5  I ordered the prawn angel hair w basil and tomatoes - good portion size and overall tasty.  I love that it came piping hot!  I would have also liked to try some other items in their menu such as the paella and gnocchi; I saw the short ribs being brought to another table which looked gigantic!!

Service: 3.5/5  Overall efficient and friendly

Price: 3.5/5  Overall reasonably priced for the amount / quality of food and atmosphere

Overall: 4/5  overall a solid 4/5; enjoyable experience  - Good versatile restaurant for a casual get-together with friends with a range of menu items fitting most people.  I would return to try some of their other food options.  I am not a drinker, but apparently we just arrived at the end of happy hour, so that would be another option for those who like to try too!"}
{"text":"I brought a friend from Toronto to experience this place for the first time. 
BIG MISTAKE! 
The food was horrible!!

We started with the Ratatouille and Chips. It was smothered in oil to the point of being inedible. We then ordered the seared scallops which was also smothered in oil. Then we ordered the short rib which was flavourful and the meat was great, however, again, it was smothered in oil. We ordered pork belly as well which was also oily. 
All in all, it was a very OILY meal. And we all left with a terrible taste in our mouths after our meal. 
Atmosphere is great. I would not recommend the food. Just drink!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but not great. 
The decor and the theme of the restaurant is somewhat confused. 
Not sure if I will come back here soon."}
{"text":"My second visit was not so great. One star less for serving calamari in a very strong sauce that kills the taste of the seafood. Why would you do that? Second star out for not updating prices on their online menu. Steak sandwich $19 on their website but in reality it's $20. One could say $1 is not a disaster but it's about principle. Also increasing prices at the time of crisis is just wrong. Not whether I will be back despite of excellent service."}
{"text":"I have read many a good review on Briggs and have friends who love it here.
I was left wanting a bit more.
Atmosphere was ok, music was played at a decent level throughout. We noted a few young kids in the dining room that were NOT happy to be there. Makes for a different type of dining experience.
At one point the kitchen decided to clean their oven during dinner and this was a horrible stench. Do not do this to your customers, please!
The kitchen is open style which I like but there was one creepy line cook that just stared at everything moving in the dining room and I did not see him cook or prep one thing!
That aside, our server was great, eager and did his best. He was knowledgeable on the menu and had recommendations. 
No sweet wines at all here, bummer.  
We came into downtown for Poutine Week on a whim and I had already pre-determined that I was getting the Newfs Poutine. Hubby had looked at the menu before we went and had decided on the Paella. (this not a true Spanish dish but their version of a Paella) He was happy with his dish for $14 and would get it again. Love the hot little pans the food comes in! Nice presentation. I had not known before coming that this restaurant was Tapas style for \"shared plates\". The food will come out at different times.
For $17 I had expected a bit more lobster in my dish and for my fries not to come out burned. The charcoal burn of the fries coated my mouth but I ate what I could, enjoying the lighter fries underneath and the cream sauce. (See pics) Server did offer to redo them but I declined... he did acknowledge that some dishes come out better than others.
I was not blown away here but would return, perhaps with a group and would try something different.
Not a date place apparently as we were told we had come on a quieter night and usually people cannot hear themselves talk over the noise when packed. Was also told they do serve lunch.
Props to the manager Amanda who met us on our way out and bought us a drink at the bar.  
For beer drinkers if you like reds, hubby recommends the local Tool Shed.
We had a wonderful ending to an OK overall experience."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 gf's met for dinner here a couple nights ago, I will call us the Calgary Tripod lol. After a quick Yelp search I came across this beauty, and suggested it to the tripod, we all agreed it would be a great new place for us to try in yyc!

Service : 
Nothing short of amazing. Upon arriving, I was greeted with warmth and a smile. We had reservations and I was early, but I was seated right away; although the restaurant was quite busy. Our waitress was incredibly nice, and very attentive to us, and all her tables. She was knowledgable of the menu and was honest with her recommendations. I wish I caught her name, I will call her Red lol (her hair was a really pretty red colour). The manager, Corey, was very attentive & engaging to all tables around the restaurant too, that's always such a nice touch. I honestly love that, very hands on. He was good-humoured and genuine, so that definitely added to the experience. :). 

*side note: the fact that they have a few dishes on the menu that \"give back\" to the community, that's simply so special. It gives a whole new remarkable addition to the experience. We loved hearing about it, and this fact alone makes me a repeat customer.*

Taste : 
Wow. Where the heck do I even begin. K, HAND ROLLED PASTA *dropsmic* lol Enough said, right?! . Wow . It was FANTASTIC. I had the hand rolled pasta with broccolini & chicken in a garlic cream sauce. All of the pasta is home made!  My noodles were a little thicker than fettuccini, & so fresh omg they were perfect. The cream sauce had such fantastic depth of flavour, it wasn't too rich, and Jst so On point. The broccolini was very green and \"al denté\", clearly they were treated right and cooked to perfection. I won't lie tho, my chicken in the pasta was a tad overcooked. They were rather small pieces, so I can see how they can over cook easily. . That's my Only criticism for this dish, but everything else about it was so beyond perfect I really can't complain. It's still what I'll be ordering next time I go, I have pure love for that dish, which it was actually Red's main recommendation! One of my gf's had the local sausage appy dish.. It came with 2 different types of sausage, pickled veg, & grainy mustard. Them sausages were so succulent, juicy, & flavourful .. I want more sausage. Seriously. lol. My Pig ordered the pesto fresh angel hair pasta: noodles fab, of course, but as per her comment, \"sauce needed a little more flavour\", she says. I didn't try, I was too infatuated with my dish.. And sausage Hahha  so I can't quite comment lol. We ordered one desert, and it was delicious. Very mesmeric and I couldn't wait to try.. I will touch on that more in my \"Overall experience\"..

Presentation : 
Presentation of the plating was simply delightful. It was creative, clean, and strategic. Incredibly aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and just as delicious. Presentation of the restaurant: Definitely clean cut and up kept very nicely. It's a new place with some character to it, with alluring decor and inviting style. We approve! :)


Atmosphere : 
Very charming atmosphere, the crowd this place lures in is definitely an attractive one. Well dressed, \"white collar\" type of crowd. The dim dinner set lighting, and classy look to the place, made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Music was at a perfect volume too, not bothersome or intrusive at all. Ambiance on point, I must say ;P. 

Overall experience : 
My overall experience was so close to 5 star, I would say a 4.75. I almost feel like I have to doc something (even if it's jst .25) for being mislead about the pumpkin cheesecake in the desert menu hahha . Although, as I mentioned, the desert was incredibly good and Presentation was fabulous , I was still expecting one thing and got another. I'm only mentioning because I'm just a human being roaming this earth obsessed with cheesecake Hahaha .  I truly KNOW my cheesecake, making fab cheesecake literally runs in my family ok lol . So my only constructive criticism would be to change the name of the pumpkin \"cheesecake\" to pumpkin \"pie\". I would have suggested maybe adding some cream cheese to the filling to make it a cheesecake, at least texturally, but the crumble on the outside was resemblant to a pie crust crumble .. So it still would have that pie feel to it tbh lol therefore, quickest fix : change the menu name lol. Regardless, that's so minor in comparison to the overall experience, needless to say, I will be back. And I cannot wait for that pasta again. 

M.M."}
{"text":"We eat at Briggs once in a while for lunch at work ( in the downtown core), and the experience is consecutively good. Booking usually isn't  that hard, as they aren't smack in the middle of the food scene in DT Calgary,  but a reservation IS recommended. 

From what I have heard, they use \"charcoal\" grills here, and it reflects in the food. The food is really good, and they have some unique items on here, like amazing devilled eggs. 

The wait staff always seems \"new\" there, and aren't as fat or efficient as one would hope, but the food always trumps that for us, and we rebook every 3 months, 

Parking is also always readily available ,as there literally is a parking complex across the street."}
{"text":"Exactly what you're looking for. Well, what we were looking for anyway. They were PACKED and the service was great and the food was prompt. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"This was so close to a 5 star! 

My husband and I were looking for a new place to go for our anniversary. This popped up on my app and looked delish! I tweeted them to see if they had GF options, just so I didn't waste my time. Which they did. 

Love the venue, great little patio, view of the parking lots isn't the prettiest, but ah well. 
The inside is very industrial, which we love. And the service was great!

We had Cat H, and she took great care of us. We have the devilled eggs, gf twisted BLT sandwich with potato leek soup and pork belly. All was amazing! And the bill including 4 glasses of champagne was $64. Which is very reasonable. 

My only complaint was they have no gluten free desserts, but that is ok."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a work trip and couldn't have been happier with my experience. The staff was extremely friendly, the atmosphere was great and the food was awesome. I had the salmon and calamari and would recommend both. Make sure you check out their cocktail menu. Lots of really creative drinks."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Briggs one day when I was in desperate need of a charger because my phone had died and I was supposed to meet a friend in downtown. The bartender was kind enough to lend me one even though I had not purchased anything to eat or drink. Mind you, I had been refused service by other restaurants for this reason. Then he offered me a glass of water while I waited for my phone to charge. Next thing I know, a server had brought out an extra bar stool so I could sit while my phone charged. The bartender was hilarious and gave me good company until my friend showed up. The manager also came by to check in and make sure I was doing okay. I was so impressed with their hospitality that I ended up eating there anyways. The food was great and the desserts were phenomenal. And the portions were the perfect size. I love Briggs and will definitely be going there often!"}
{"text":"When my girlfriend and I arrived, we were greeted immediately by a staff at the front door.
Andrew, our waiter, provided amazing service and hospitality. 
He went above and beyond thats all I can say. 
The tomahawk is a must get, it took about  30minutes roughly but we were informed before hand that the steak will take that long to be prepared. 
When the steak arrived I saw almost perfection in how they cooked it. In addition, the steak came with additional sides complements(mushrooms/salsa/lettuce/(side ordered fries ~ sorry folks does not come with the steak!),
Words cannot describe how satisfied my girlfriend and I were at the end of the night. 
Thank you Andrew! 
Overall: Friendly attitude & service + amazing steak & food! (Tomahawk!)"}
{"text":"Ooooo Briggs. You make a hell of a Caesar! Great kick, well seasoned. Yummmm!
Also, those Josper Chicken Wings with lemon salt and chili ketchup? Get out... 
The cheese fondue dip with foccacia is cheesy heaven. 
Want to really make your night? Dip the wings in the cheese. You won't be sorry. (Thanks Carley for telling that to the waitress, suggesting they serve them together). 
Oh man. I'd hit up Briggs again to see what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Briggs has some delicious foods - the sweet pea soup for example.  Love the veggie side dishes too.  Great little patio and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour. Service was speedy and the server was very helpful when I asked for suggestions. They were having an event that evening and asked me to come back. Both plates I had were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. Got a table on a Friday night but had to start out at the bar which was a bit disappointing as I had made reservations on open table earlier.  But tables seemed to open up after 7:30 as the after work crowd was clearing out.  Which led to a slight mixup in service with the waitresses who didn't figure out that our party had moved and we were not being served.
But after apologies they got to work and service was really good plus the food was great.  
We ordered the 48oz tomahawk ribeye which we ordered medium rare.  Nicely marbled with a Fred Flintstone size rib bone.  We had the three of us and we had to take some home.  It comes with mushrooms which was \"meh\".  But the grilled romaine was really interesting and refreshing along with the tomato salsa.   We ordered the brussel sprouts on the side which was a delicious choice.
Oh the one other mis-step was we ordered fries and they didn't ring that in for the kitchen until our supper was almost finished.  Fries were nicely crispy and a bargain for $4.00?  
Bill was a bit hefty but was a nice change of pace.  Liked it way better than the keg style steakhouse.   I've been here before for lunch a couple of times and it was great then too.  The lobster mac n cheese is fabulous.
So I docked it .5 for the couple of service issues.  Waitresses were however very nice and efficient otherwise."}
{"text":"Very good relax place to hang out. Clean, good service, good atmosphere, not too busy The 48 oz Tomahawk Rib eye steak is really good, very juicy, tender & flavorful. $89 with Salsa tomatoes & smoked mushroom side dishes. Highly recommended to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday.... we were seated in a private glass room which was really nice. Our server was very friendly and attentive. 

I was super excited to try this place for the first time based on other yelp reviews. Maybe it was an off day but our food was meh!!! I ordered the hanger stake which was very chewy, the piece I had was stringy and sauce was on the salty side. My boyfriend ordered the deluxe chuck burger it looked delicious but the it was a sloppy mess. The bun was soggy after the first bite; it couldn't hold up to the egg and sauce. Overall in our entire table the short rib was the best plate."}
{"text":"Did the tasting menu (45 a person for 5 courses). Dont do it if youre fussy about your food but if you can just relax and let the chef do his absolute best, you will have an incredible time. There was no hipster/weird food combinations on our menu that afternoon but it was all definitely still unique and cooked to perfection. 

Unlike other sitdown/date nighty restaurants in the city, the service quality didn't immediately tank once we didn't order drinks, which I really appreciate. I'm someone who does drink sometimes and doesn't other times, and so I get a great variety of service from people, but I feel bad for my parents (teetotalers) who always seem to get shit service just because they dont order wine with everything. So a very special thank you to the Briggs staff for letting them feel like \"normal\" valued diners."}
{"text":"Nice place for group or your date. Came here myself while waiting to be seated up at Japanese Village. I Asked the bar tender what's best cockails for ladies as most of what's in the menus didn't attract me and to my surprise, I got what I really want. It was precise and I end up having 3 glasses. It's always best to ask experts. There are ample parking spaces but the advantage of living downtown is that I don't drive to go to where I'd like to go as most places are walking distance. Servers here are amazing! Will be back to try out their food!"}
{"text":"Clearly a 4 star experience.  Briggs Kitchen for me is an interesting twist on classic Canadian cuisine.  My lunch group of 5 (yesterday) started off with Poutine w/lobster plus classic Poutine.  While both were a tad rich they tasted good.  I then had the sweet pea soup which was good.  Not great but a good 4 star dish,.  Also had these potato puffs with a cheese dipping sauce that were amazing.  Had a lovely cauliflower dish to complement everything.

This was a good place for a business lunch for 5.  The noise level was a bit higher then I typically prefer and the service is acceptable.  Is this a 5 star establishment?  No way.  4 star? Yup.

I will eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I recently visited Briggs for the first time.  Overall, I was pleased with the menu and atmosphere, but thought there could have been some improvements to the food and service.  

I had the short ribs and charred broccolini - the short ribs had a lot of fat on them and were served on top of something that to be honest I couldn't tell if it was potatoes or more fat.  I love broccolini, but served charred (ie. burnt) does not taste good at all.  They also have a limited selection of spirits and do not stock a full bar.  Our server was very nice and funny, but the service was on the slow side.  The redeeming factor was the lemon pie.  Big enough to share with another person, it was sooooo good!

There were small kids in the restaurant, which I was surprised at because I personally don't think Briggs has a child-friendly menu or vibe.

Overall, I liked the atmosphere, so could give Briggs another chance, but personally I wouldn't recommend the menu items noted above, except  for the lemon pie of course!"}
{"text":"Brigg's is an enjoyable place to go for dinner with a large group of friends. The service was good and the food was great. Especially the lobster poutine. However, the drink prices were too high and no drink deals. I would only go there for dinner. I wouldn't stay for drinks or go there for drinks."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant where we went with a group of ten people. 

The good: Service was very nice. Had the \"Briggs experience\", on which you tasted everything (very good idea). Group room had a tv on which we could watch sports. Food is terrific! 

The bad: When door was open (or not closed properly), it was very loud. Bathroom small. Meat is rare, so if you like it done you might be disappointed. Forgot to ask me for a drink (although asked everyone else). Can be expensive.

The bads are very minor as good service and great food makes it a nice experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice hipster spot that's open late on a Sunday night (~11pm).

What we got:

Brussel Sprouts with Honey/Bacon: Delicious brussel sprouts. Note: This is presented in a slaw-like fashion, not the \"normal\" ball of brussel sprouts. Delicious sauce $10

Paella: Small cast-iron skilled of paella. Nothing to write home about but still good $15

Newf's Poutine: Lobster poutine, lobster cream sauce, cheese, fries. $19

Banana MLF: I'm still confused on what I ate. But it was presented nicely and tasted delicious. Banana whipped cream with some flaky crumb thing? Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"It would be hard for our experience at Briggs to have been any worse. 

Our reserved table was given away - due to somewhat understandable circumstances - for which we received next to no apology. The manager seemed more annoyed at us than anything. 

We were then taken to a high top next to the bar, with chairs so low, that we could practically rest our chins on the table. The music and din was such that you could only hear the person right beside you, and barely even that. 

After nearly 40 mins of waiting for our food - and inquiring about it - two of seven meals came out, without the fries. They were both cold, as were the five meals that followed. One of the meals was the wrong order completely. While one person in our party opted to send her cold burger back, the rest of us had to eat ours as we were already going to be late getting back to work. 

The brisket sandwich was cold, dry and tasteless and the bread was so hard that the roof of my mouth is still stinging. We had to pick up our own drinks at the bar, where they sat, and request a random employee to track down our bill. 

Our server was apologetic and obviously well aware of the terrible experience we were having. What boggles the mind is that neither of the two managers roaming around had the decency and professionalism to come over and speak to us, let alone maybe comp a few items from our bill. Any sort of acknowledgement from them would have gone a long way but that was not to be. Super disappointing.

Across the board, awful and we'll never return."}
{"text":"This place is very energetic (read loud) but it contributes to the lively ambience. The food is very good as is the service. I had the chicken pot pie special for lunch on Wednesday and it was delicious. The wine list is more than adequate - I've killed many a bottle with friends here since the place opened. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this place again for the second time, but went as a large group this time!

We were seated in the separate room where it was nice and private but it was sooo hot inside as the temperature was not adjustable for the room. We had to open the door to get some air which kind of defeats the point of having a private room. 

They have something called the Briggs Experience where you let the server pick out your menu. You can specify allergies, how many courses you want, and your budget and they can pick things out to meet these points. I thought it seemed adventurous but also a bit risky if you are a picky eater. 

Our group decided that we wanted to try the tomahawk steak and we let our server choose the rest of the appies etc.. Everything that we had were really great, like the poutine and brussels sprouts. We had the perfect amount of food for the group and it was awesome.  

Our server Andrew was really great, I would honestly go as far to say that you should request for him to be your server, especially if you have a large group. He is great at suggesting things without being pushy and knows the menu inside out. 

I want to give this place a 4.5/5 but as Yelp doesn't have half stars, I gave it a 4. I dislike the limited parking around the area - you can pay $2 to park in the covered parkade across the street if you don't want to risk parking your car in an area full of drunk people especially on weekends. The place itself gives off the vibe like a fancy bar rather than a restaurant (but they do have great drinks) which is kind of sad because the food here is actually pretty good. If you've been turned off by the bar-like atmosphere and doubted the food here, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday on a Thursday. We booked the private room. A few of us were early and had drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. Service was fantastic the whole night through. I loved our server! She was upbeat and personable and didn't mind splitting the bill (yes, we were those people). I love the share a glass of wine with a stranger concept they have. If you order certain bottles, you can give away a glass to a table in the restaurant and the bottle is significantly cheaper than if you were to purchase otherwise. Very unique idea and great selling feature. Food was super good too! We shared a few items including the tomahawk steak, humboldt calamari, roasted broccoli, angel hair pasta, mushroom deviled eggs, cheese fondue. Everything was really good but my standouts were the roasted broccoli covered in mascarpone and the fondue. I would come back and just eat those and be full of cheese and happy. I have been about 5 times before and have never been disappointed. All in all, awesome."}
{"text":"This place has such a great atmosphere, and provides wonderful service.

Atmosphere: It is a loud, casual, fun place to get together on a date, or with some friends. It is both modern and industrial looking! 

Food: The food was on-par. Everything was pretty delicious, but I do have to say the best thing we had on their menu was their cheesy broccoli! It had a wonderful charred flavour, with cheesy deliciousness!!! TRY IT! :)

Service: This is my favourite aspect of Briggs. The service was great. There was never a moment where we didn't have a drink in our hands, or were left wondering where our server was!

Good place to try! Check it out."}
{"text":"Overall we really enjoyed our experience here. However we wouldn't be quick to rush back for a more intimate dinner since we found the copious number of sports TVs took away from would could have been a more upscale/romantic/on trend ambiance. Good food and an even better drink menu."}
{"text":"I'm about to order the tomahawk chop! 42 oz.  Of madness! 42 oz prime rib are you freaking kidding me this is going to be epic! If y'all get the chance check this place out the food is crazy, atmosphere is dope definately worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!!

I was staying in downtown Calgary for work and was looking for a local place to try for dinner that wasn't going to break the bank. I looked at what was kind of near where I was staying and Briggs seemed to stick out. Definitely the right choice. I came with my boss and we looked over the menu and COULD NOT decide. We ended up getting a few dishes to share and each one was fantastic. The beets: amazing, the beans: amazing, the paella: AMAZING!!
The service was also really friendly and the servers were quick to tell us what their favorite dishes are and provide suggestions. 

Next time I stay downtown I will definitely be back to try more off the menu!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the ratings, and I have no idea why people enjoy it. The restaurant is dark and the music is too loud. They have TVs to watch sports which is good. The food we ordered included the stealhead with risotto, a stir fry with vegetables and  the halibut burger. The stealhead was way over priced for what you got, and the risotto was very poorly cooked. The stir fry was 90% noodles when it was specifically asked what the amount of vegetables in it would be (she said about 50/50). The waitress couldn't remember what was in the stir fry and never came back to confirm what the 'seasonable vegetables' were. The halibut burger was minimal fish with a small salad on the side. Overall, I was not at all impressed and thought the place was very over priced for what you got."}
{"text":"We had the Briggs experience last night, dinner started off with some devil eggs and calamari both were good.  Calamari were smaller pieces, soft and chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Then we had lobster poutine and mushroom ravioli, the poutine was decadent not for anyone on a diet, butter on top of butter.  There's a unique taste to it.  Dinner was beef short rib, mahi mahi, and seared broccoli.  The fish was over cooked, the rib was good but didn't have the flavour you'd expect for something that's marinated over night and braised for six hours.  Highlight I would say (and the 4 of us agreed) was the ravioli.  I had the pepper tonic and that's a must try if you want a kick in your drink.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Very strong 4.  Everything hit well, ultra-cool decor and super great service.  

We walked in at prime time dinner time on a Thursday.  Not very crowded and got seated immediately.

Great cocktail list though the first round of cocktails was a little weak. Second round definitely better.  

The paella was nearly perfect with a lovely saffron flavor, spicy chorizo and crispy rice.  I might have wanted a little more calamari, but a really strong dish.

The piperade was fantastic as were the creamy parmesan bread used to dip in it.  Flavors really bursted.

The Josper half chicken had a perfectly crispy skin and the fries were cooked to an even more crispy perfection.  Very salt and peppery just the way I like them.

The crab gnocchi was really delicious and perhaps my favorite of the night (that or the piperade).  I just wish they scooped on more of the delicious lobster cream sauce.

Lastly we had a peach tart with caramel gelato.  Really nice flavors, though the texture of the peachese could have been softer / less chewy.

We only were able to squeeze one dinner in for Calgary and glad we chose this place!"}
{"text":"Busy.
Trendy.
Bustling.


Although that is emotionally distancing as a customer ... the food is very good, and the staff is greatgreat.

I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. I've been here on numerous occasions and each time I've had the lobster poutine and paella. Both so good. I've also had the salmon, which was also good but I'm not sure if the salmon is wild or farmed.  For dessert they have a crispy pastry that is light and flaky and doesn't make you feel guilty about having dessert. So good!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar in downtown Calgary. The food items are especially well thought out. Eclectic, tasty, organic and wonderful ingredients. Authentic items. Worth trying several and all will be pleasing. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. Got a table on a Friday night but had to start out at the bar which was a bit disappointing as I had made reservations on open table earlier.  But tables seemed to open up after 7:30 as the after work crowd was clearing out.  Which led to a slight mixup in service with the waitresses who didn't figure out that our party had moved and we were not being served.
But after apologies they got to work and service was really good plus the food was great.  
We ordered the 48oz tomahawk ribeye which we ordered medium rare.  Nicely marbled with a Fred Flintstone size rib bone.  We had the three of us and we had to take some home.  It comes with mushrooms which was \"meh\".  But the grilled romaine was really interesting and refreshing along with the tomato salsa.   We ordered the brussel sprouts on the side which was a delicious choice."}
{"text":"Last night I visited Briggs for the first time, I actually didn't know the place existed but a couple friends threw out the idea and so this new food adventure began. Briggs' is on 10th Ave right beside Japanese Village, Craft and National, pretty solid area and works well with the parkade across the street.

Right away upon entering I was pretty impressed with the atmosphere and ambience, a good combination of upscale and trendy but still relaxed. This fell on game 5 of the Flames/Ducks series so it was probably a bit louder and noisier than what I'd imagine it usually is. We came well into the hockey game already starting (prior commitments), kind of on a whim not really expecting to get a table. Given the busy sporting occasion the immediate answer was they didn't have room with a view of the game. They did have some room in the dining room absent of TVs, but we were really hoping to catch the last half of the game. Upon further investigation they did end up suggesting a table with limited view, the booth sitting side had about an 80-90% view of the TV and the other side 40-50% with turned chairs. Nonetheless it was better than running around and trying to find another place with seats. The table was quite adequate in the end and I was quite happy they put in the effort to make it work. But at the same time had mixed feelings about how they thought \"no\" first with pretty firm unaccommodating regard. I'm big on customer service and thinking \"yes\" first.

From here the up and down continued, again I was really impressed with the environment and aesthetic of this restaurant/bar, they had a wide assortment of unique design touches that even extended into the washroom, this was topped off with an open concept kitchen that didn't hide anything. Beautiful establishment really. Where things were pulled down again was with the service, our server was very laid back and un-invested in making us feel welcome. He had a surfer like non-chalant demeanor which unfortunately translated to us feeling like he didn't care about making our experience a memorable one. He was quick enough on the initial drink order but then didn't follow up with our food order for probably a good 10-15 minutes, I would've accepted this had he been catering to the busier lounge but really he was only dealing with a smaller section and had approached other tables ignoring us at least once. Then came the upswing again...our food order came quick after we put it in and it was delicious! I had the \"You Wrap Lettuce Wraps\" they were great, a step above Earls and Cactus Club lettuce wraps IMO. Everyone else at the table was satisfied with their meals as well and the server did make sure to check-up on us during the meal. We enjoyed beers with our meals from a smaller draft/bottle selection that still had a couple unique options to make it quaint. Then the slight downhill drop again, when we needed to settle our tab our server was nowhere to found and we had to ask the manager for our bill. He did make a final appearance with the merchant machine to take care of the actual transaction and thank us though. I will say the manager was very kind and professional; he did help us secure the table to begin with and was quick to help us get the tab.

So all things considered I left Briggs' Kitchen + Bar with mixed emotions, it easily had the potential and resources to be a 5/5 but fell short on customer service on this occasion. Every time there was an uptick in something there was a pullback on something else, but overall it was more positive than negative which is why I'm giving them a 4/5 for this visit, I will be back to give them a shot at that 5/5 ;-)."}
{"text":"GREAT food and solid old fashioned."}
{"text":"Been a few times, always like it. Pub style on one side and the food is very good. Steak sandwich is a classic go to followed by the fish burger."}
{"text":"Great place for friends to gather and enjoy some fine food, my favs are the lobster rolls, soups, and the tomahawk, great food and great service."}
{"text":"I've been to Briggs a few times over the years and have always received good service. The location is convenient and they have ample parking between a surface lot, street parking and the parkades right across the street, just read the signs in the lot and don't park in the Japenese Village lots. I like sharing different items off the menu, they have some delicious veggie appetizers and the mussels were awesome. I always eye the massive tomahawk steak but never order it although the servers have told me it's a popular option."}
{"text":"Our waiter provided excellent service, and our party of four thoroughly enjoyed all the food that we ordered, which was eleven items,  which is almost the entire sharing menu. There was not one item that we would not order again, the calamari, shortrib, and the vegetables were all so good, and their poutine made a hit with someone that had never had poutine before. All this food cost me a little over a hundred dollars, which is pretty reasounable to me. 
Briggs is not a quiet or ramantic venue, but it is a great place to enjoy some great food, service and friends!"}
{"text":"went here for brunch a few months ago...

why I'm a fan:

1. sexy interior, I did not use the bathroom, however,and so I am not sure if the bathroom was sexy as well
2. not \"narrow/ cramped\" like many good brunch places in yyc
3. you can make reservations, again seems quite rare
4. their food selection was solid, crepes and perogies were on my list! (with several good looking morning \"adult\" beverages as well)
5. friendly, efficient service

lost one star for portion size, but I will still come back!

apparently they have a solid dinner menu and private room for those big parties you always want to hold, but are not sure of the best venue...."}
{"text":"Their menu is so good, so much to choose from. I've had their burger several times, the fish sandwich (cod) several times and the delicious Chicken sandwich. All outstanding, the staff there have always been really nice and welcoming, especially when you are a return visitor. The fries a little salty, not the end of the world, but I would very much recommend Briggs."}
{"text":"Wow! This food was amazing. Our waitress (forget her name, but the blonde from Nova Scotia) was incredible, accommodated for vegetarians and explained all our foods in detail. We asked for the Brigg special; where all the food is chosen for you and shared. So everything was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Briggs on a recent visit to Calgary, and it was my best dining experience in the city. I loved everything about it. First, I love industrial light, hipster, fun food, nice people type joints, and this is one of them. But it was the warm and gracious welcome I received from the host when I entered that gave me such a great impression. As a single person on business, I am very impressed when a restaurant makes me feel so welcomed, and this one did. Once I was seated, I was immediately served at my table by the bartender (so nice, fun and cute, btw), and he so heartily recommended the burger. He was right. It was delicious. And the fries -- they brought an huge portion as an accompaniment to the burger. I couldn't eat them all, but I wanted to because they were so crisp and salty. 

Those on here complaining about portion size -- what do you normally eat? A cow? The portions were more than adequate.

The cocktails are freshly made, innovative and priced just right around $9. The same cocktail would be much more expensive in other bars.

Great experience here that I heartily recommend."}
{"text":"Hit up Briggs on Easter Monday with a couple of girlfriends and the whole experience was beyond amazing. Our server, Jeremy (owner/manager??), was phenomenal throughout the whole night. He was attentive, engaging and really great about choosing our meal for us. We opted for the \"Briggs experience\", setting our meal value at $35 per person, and let our server choose our menu for the night. 

We got to try 7 dishes from the menu (deviled eggs, lobster poutine, curry chicken salad, mahi mahi, short rib, brussel sprouts and the chocolate pot soufflé) and all of it was incredible. I won't bother describing all the dishes but my favourites were probably the lobster poutine, brussel sprouts and chocolate pot. For $35 a person, we definitely got our monies worth. 

Basically our night at Briggs (atmosphere, food, service) was everything you could ever ask for in a perfect dining experience. I would absolutely recommend Briggs and go back."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm visiting Calgary from Texas and If you have all of your good senses, you will listen to me now. 
Stop reading this review. 
Run to Briggs Kitchen + Bar. NOW! 
Call a couple of friends and ask them to meet you there. 
Order a couple of cocktails. The bartender really knows what he is doing and the drink menu is outstanding. Then listen to Sam, an extraordinary attentive service person, but please by all means, order the BURGER!!!  In my opinion, The Absolute BEST Burger on the North American Continent.  Our experience was completely and insanely outstanding. The appetizer, burger, salad and dessert was exceptional. Ok. Why are you still here reading this review. RUN!"}
{"text":"Well, food here is pretty good. Especially their bacon (we had brunch). So thick and flavourful! The French toast was pretty good as well. However, I would prefer it not deep fried."}
{"text":"I had the Rock Crab Gnocchi.  It came with peas, pea shoots, crab and the gnocchi (seared) in a light cream sauce.  It was pretty good.  

Service was quick even though the restaurant was packed and buzzing with activity!  It was noisy and difficult to speak to one another."}
{"text":"This place was a refreshing take on new Canadian food. My coworkers and I checked into our hotel down the street and went here for our first Canadian meal during the business trip. 

We had a slight issue finding the place as apple maps is very unhelpful (not surprisingly), but once we found the actual restaurant it was a delightful surprise. Immediately after being seated we found ourselves greeted by a server who explained that the menu is meant to be shared family style and that many customers have just thrown caution to the wind and allowed a table full of random selections from the waitress.

We decided to have our waitress choose a selection of appetizers and we would each choose and entree. For appetizers, we were given tic tacs and calamari. The tic tacs can be described as asiago cheese and potato stuffed tim bits and were delicious. The calamari, however was a bit questionable. Our entrees were also good and the drinks we had were fabulous (I had the rosemary gin and egg white one). 

Overall, everything was very good and I would recommend this place if you are nearby and want to experience new Canadian food."}
{"text":"I was pretty happy to see something new open up on 10th ave. near my office. Particularly that it is not another large beer hall. I have been here for several meals, lunch, dinner and even brunch. The food on the whole is outstanding. The Josper ovens add an awesome smokiness to just about everything. 

Brunch here on a Sunday was also excellent. I don't why, but that surprised me. I had the Eggs Benny and my mother had the French Toast. The eggs benny was pretty straight forward, but good and the potato pancake it came with was fantastic. I tried the French Toast, and Wow. 

My all time favorite dish here, however is the plain ol' burger. I think I've had it 5 times! Pretty hard to go wrong for $12 too!

My only complaint about Briggs is the share menu. I've had several of the items on it, and all are great. But they're small, and they're not cheap. I know they're for sharing, which is why they are small, but the price should probably reflect this. I think if more of the items were under $10 as opposed to over, I woul be more apt to go this way. 

One final note, decent beer selection for $6 per is pretty decent value considering the price at the neighbours down the road!

Either way, check this place out."}
{"text":"The mushroom ravioli, old fashioned and white wine I tried were a perfect accompaniment to a lowkey conversation. The server was attentive and very casual and relatable. I would definitely return to this spot again as its location is very good too. Plenty of artsy stores surrounding and very close walk to 17th avenue as well. You can finish lunch or dinner at Briggs and then head to coffee at Philosafy coffee shop if you want."}
{"text":"Enjoying an amazingly delicious  brunch on the patio  Food service and atmosphere 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I dream about the Beets + Pistachios and Those Brussel Sprouts (with bacon and honey). The Crispy Humboldt Calamari is always cooked just to perfectly tender.  Greg's Marg is yummy and don't miss the Lemon Tart!

By the way, a large group can split the 48 oz Tomahawk Rib Eye which is enormous."}
{"text":"Have been looking forward to visiting for awhile. Reservations were made and excitement building. An hour before dinner we were given tickets to see a hockey game and not sure if we could make dinner and a game work. 

We decided to show up a bit early, explained our dilemma and what happened next blew our minds. Our family of four was in and out within an hour. Fed, treated like superstars and made to feel awesome, but never rushed. Everything really was awesome that night.

I partook in The Big Taste offering for dinner. Hubs had a burger (so delicious), and kids shared a few plates. The food was extraordinary. The service bar none. There were several people (staff) coming to the table, taking away empty plates, assisting and doing what every restaurant should be doing....working as a team. And not just our table, all the tables.

Seriously awestruck at the service and food. If I could give 10 stars I would. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 and went for the Briggs Experience. It was definitely worth it and we made sure to have the Tomahawk. Everyone enjoyed the meal.  We had the carmelized onion poutine, sausages, smoked wings, curry chicken salad, mushroom ravioli, creamy potatoes and kale."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars easily !
My wife rarely eats burgers in restaurants and when she orders them, she usually takes a bite and throws it away. The fact that she declared the burgers in Briggs the \"Best Burger she's ever had \" says it all !!

Excellent service, great ambience. I've never been disappointed 

The only weird thing was that they asked for 100$ deposit and 24-hour cancelation penalty for booking a table for 10 people!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and food.

We were looking for a different restaurant to try in the city and came across Briggs on the Yelp App.  4 stars?  More than 80+ reviews?  We're in.

Briggs did not disappoint.  From the moment we were seated, we were treated with impeccable service.  Granted, this was a weekday evening so it was not completely full at all, but even still, everything was well executed.

Apparently their lobster mac and cheese is no longer on the menu, but has been replaced by something \"better\" - the Rock Crab & Ricotta Gnocchi - so we ordered it and it was delicious.  

I ordered the Josper Half Chicken on a whim with broccoli on the side.  While the ingredients appeared, everything on the plate just stood out.  The chicken was succulent and even the broccoli has a great grill taste to it.  

4 stars.  Will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We went to Briggs for NYE dinner. We made reservations on open table and were seated immediately upon arrival. I was very impressed with the decor of Briggs... I could stay there all day! Our server, Steven, was very attentive and professional. We stared with Poutine (I'll post a picture).... which was amazing. I ordered a pulled pork type sandwich for my entree, which was great! If I come back to Calgary, I'll definitely return to Briggs!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times I was blown away by their food. Two of my favourites are their brisket sliders and there decadent Brussels sprouts. It's not a place I would go for the cocktails, but for food I would go back more than once."}
{"text":"My favorite favorite restaurant in Calgary. Great service and fabulous food. Both poutines are spectacular as well as the tomahawk. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Lunchtime is always a great time to check out a new restaurant, it's a fantastic time to sample your meal at a much lower cost than a full out dinner... and helps you decide whether you'll come back to spend more of your hard earned money!

Good news for Briggs, I will be back! I quite enjoyed my lunch last week.

The menu caters to both food sharers and non-food sharers. So, if you have friends that aren't into the whole \"let's taste each others food\" thing, there are still plenty of options!

For the record, I'm a sharer.

We shared:
- deviled eggs. They were made with mushrooms and bacon. Such a fun twist on this old-school fave!
- sausage. These were locally-made. They were pretty good, but didn't stand out to me.
- lobster mac'n cheese. So good! I think this was my fave dish. It comes with edamame beans too. It added a bit of crunch to the texture.
- Salmon sliders. Thankfully pretzel buns haven't been overdone yet. I quite enjoyed the pickled cucumber and \"tartare\" mayo on these. Bonus: You can order them by the slider!

One thing to be wary of, the acoustics aren't great. On a Tuesday lunch, it wasn't that busy, but the room was already quite loud. I can see it being hard to hear the rest of your party when the room is more full."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I like to eat low carb and there were a few great options which is always noteworthy to me. The food was very well prepared...I recommend the beef short rib (although it has a sauce that isn't so low carb if you care) and the winter seasonal beets (with feta, mint, and pine nuts). 

The service was very good. Our waiter was a sweet Aussie guy but we also had three other guys approach the table to make sure everything was great - and it was!

The only negative (which really has nothing to do with Briggs) was parking... Where did one park if the two lots next to it are reserved only, there's no street stalls available, and the other 3 lots are full?! (This is why downtown bugs me)"}
{"text":"Brigg's Kitchen and bar is located on 10th avenue SW, just down the street from National on 10th.  Christine and I were looking for a new place to try and she suggested Briggs as we both haven't been.  We parked on the street as it wasn't overly busy.  There is a set of stairs you walk up before reaching the restaurant and upon entering; we were immediately greeted by a hostess who then walked us to our table. 

It was around 7:00PM at night and it wasn't busy but there was a stream of customers entering throughout the night.  Brigg's dining area is very open, with wooden accents, large light fixtures, dimmed lights and a visible kitchen.  There is also a private room that, I believe can seat 6-8 people and its tucked away in the corner with glass walls.  

Sam, our Australia server came to greet us.  He was friendly and made a ton of recommendations.  Christine and I shared a pint of Mill Street Organic Lager and we both had sparkling water as well.  If you are not a big fan of beer, I would highly suggest Mill Street as it has a very light finish and is rather tasty.  For our meal, we decided to start with some crispy humbolt calamari and share a crispy BC halibut burger which normally came with fries but we upgraded to the Newf's poutine which has chunks of lobster for a hefty addition of $11.50.  Calamari came out first, and it was topped with some cabbage tossed in some fennel and there was tomato aioli for a dipping sauce.  Christine and I really enjoyed the calamari as it was very lightly battered for just enough crispiness and the squid was very tender.  There was a licorice taste to the cabbage and we weren't big fans of it.  Next time we will have that omitted.  The dipping sauce was creamy and had a little kick to it which was nice.  The halibut burger came with tartar aioli, romaine lettuce, cucumbers and jalapeno relish; it was all in a super soft bun.  The halibut was flaky and all the fixings went well with it.  At first bite, it was a melt in your mouth kind of deal, everything went well together but I couldn't help but to think it wasn't anything particularly special.  Although, the lobster poutine was divine!  They were generous with their chunks of lobster, cheese curds were noticeable melted throughout the poutine and the sauce it came with was rich, tasty and creamy!  We both polished it off.  Sam was very alert, ensuring we were enjoying the dishes and prompt with taking away the empty plates.

Overall, Brigg's provides tasty food with reasonable prices.  I'm anxious to try their weekend brunch - breakfast perogies?! Yes please!!!!  I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I ate there previously before finding out that I have food sensitivities around dairy and gluten. The food was fantastic.

Went back there the other day and it was not an easy place to work with. Their menu doesn't identify the different allergens and the server rambled them off so quick I just felt overwhelmed and didn't remember what was okay or not.

We ended up leaving. 

If you don't have allergies this place is great. Service was good. Food tasted good."}
{"text":"My group and I visited Briggs just yesterday.   It was amazing!  All of our food was great, the service was fantastic.  We watched the Broncos beat the Patriots here, and enjoyed chatting with the bartender as well as the drinks.  I recommend the deviled eggs, brussel sprouts and the lemon chicken.  Everyone else loved their food as well."}
{"text":"I love this venue, after several visits I still think it's amazing! One of the newer managers, Paddy, is the absolute best. The tomahawk steak is so impressive, we bring most of our  friends and family who visit here. We had a slightly unimpressive experience recently, and Paddy took it so seriously. He jumped in, spoiled us, and saved the day! Kudos. Thanks a million. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Killer dinner and great atmosphere. Waitstaff and manager were great. Had the short rib, Newfs poutine (lobster) and wings. Wings were ok, the poutine was a 10, short rib was a 10 (only wish the hash browns were crispier). Sat by the kitchen and watched them bring out some other dishes we want to try next time."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff with good drinks and good selection on beer.  Food was interesting and the overall experience well worth the stop.  If anything finish off with their chocolate pot dessert which was amazing."}
{"text":"Great double cheeseburger and Cobb salad. Lobster cheese curd French fries were delicious. Excellent, friendly service."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time - moving to Bragg Creek has meant it's been harder to get out with dogs waiting at home. 

Showed up at just before six, there was room. They don't take reservations for parties less than 8. 

Decor: sadly, it's standard Calgary \"new restaurant\" style. Failing in the same way Vancouver did a few years back with all their \"west coast\" design. There are TV's.....which take this place from \"could've been a decent bistro\" to pub category. 

Staff: again, sadly, jeans & t-shirts. I really wish there was somewhere to go in Calgary that made people feel like dressing up a bit and having a \"pretty\" night out. Kind of getting uber disappointed with the jeans thing. Clothing is expression, as much as food is....I wish some type of something was initiated by new restaurants. 

Food: Fast, hot, creative. Had the braised cauliflower with curry oil, mushrooms, ratatouille & calamari. All done well but a bit salty all around. The veggie ratatouille was uber salty - reported to the kitchen. In-house flatbread was great. 

Drinks: millstreet organic beer, old fashioned. The beer was on draft & good, the old fashioned's were mixed well. A bit too much ice and a ilttle shy of bourbon however, tasty. 

It all came out to around $70 before taxes & tip. Pretty fair pricing considering the diggs. 

Not sure we will go back however, would recommend people try it out for themselves. 

Good to see new businesses, just wish they would try a little harder in thinking outside the box for actual facility design."}
{"text":"You have got to try their loaded burger....might need some CPR afterwards.....and, don't forget the fries!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening as a party of 5 and enjoyed a booth table by the windows.

We ended up getting a whole bunch of dishes to share:
- fried calamari - these were cut in such a way that they looked like little tator tots!
- paella
- pappardelle
- potato gnocchi
- josper roasted broccoli - we had to ask what josper was after seeing it mentioned numerous times on the menu. Apparently, it is a type of oven!
- tomahawk rib eye

Overall, the quality of food was excellent. My husband and I particularly enjoyed the pappardelle dish. Our only complaints: the paella was a tad salty & our tomahawk was overdone - we would have preferred a medium rare, but it was closer to a well-done/medium. However, even with the overdone-ness, the tomahawk still tasted great, and we loved eating it with the salsa.

We've already recommended this restaurant to others and we'd definitely come back if we're back in the area."}
{"text":"So I'd never heard of this place but my friend from Houston decided that we should have a girls night out and this was her chosen dinner venue.  When we went it had only been open a week but I'm a little behind on the review writing because I've had many similar girls nights since then.

You know the type of night I'm talking about....where you start at the National down the street for post-work drinks and probably have a few too many before you continue on to your dinner reservation where you have a bit more wine before leaving for more booze down the street.  You know the type of night I'm talking about RIGHT?

Anyways, on to Briggs.  Would you believe we arrived a tad boozy?  

The server was new but did a great job helping us pick out a some wine.  The rest of the girls ordered some appy's before their mains but I was trying to be healthy so I stuck with a salad and copious amounts of booze.  Soooooo responsible right?  Vegetables absorb alcohol like nobody's business.

Long story short, we had a great time, the food was tasty, and the server was cute and competent.  Winning all around!

Bottom line - boozy or not, give them a try."}
{"text":"I don't normally complain about places as I am a server myself, but man o' man was the service so terrible. We waited 30 minutes(not exaggerating.. we timed it) until we finally had to ask for menus. We got eyes up by 3 servers the entire time we were waiting. They kept walking passed us and glaring at us. I'm in the industry and it just blew my mind how these servers treated us. Maybe it was just an off night but I don't think I'll be back to Briggs."}
{"text":"Ugh. I hate writing such a negative review for a restaurant with seemingly good food, but we had such a horrible experience here. We made a reservation at Briggs for Saturday night. When we arrived, the restaurant was clearly packed. As expected for a Saturday, but for whatever reason this was surprising to the staff and it showed. We had absolutely horrendous service. Our server took unacceptably long to come to our table. Our waters were filled by the hostess once, and remained empty for the rest of the night. Our server brought our drinks and took our food order, and that was the last time we saw her until we had to flag her down for the bill. Our drinks were empty and she never came by. She never checked up on our food, even though we wanted more ketchup and wanted to order more drinks. We would have stayed longer and ordered more drinks/dessert, but we just wanted to leave by the time we were done our meal. 

I totally understand being busy. However, the server didn't apologize until the end when she brought the bill. Basically, I felt like she wanted us to feel bad she was busy and leave a better tip. 

The food was decent, which somewhat saved the experience. We ordered the roasted chicken dinner, which was nice. The chicken was a bit dry though, and the coleslaw was so vinegary/sour I could barely eat it. The fries were good. We also ordered the rock crab gnocchi. I honestly think the crab should be ditched - the ricotta gnocchi was the star of this dish. The cold crab mixture didn't jive overly well with the gnocchi. 

We definitely would not come back here. Horribles service almost ruined our Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Great food and dining experience with this restaurant in Calgary! The major reason we dropped in this restaurant is we do not need to wait for table. After we saw the food, we definitely LOVE the food! Professional and tasty! We finished all the food! Definitely recommend this place for first timer in this town!"}
{"text":"The small plate menu is fantastic, many options and all of decent size portions. I went with one other person and we order lots of little things in order to try as much as possible. We ordered the chicken wings (unbelievably delicious), brisket sliders (tasty, good beef to bun ratio), beets and balsamic (best beets in Calgary thus far), roasted cauliflower (excellent flavor), potato tic tacs (not good- lacked in flavor and texture), sausage and mustard (nothing special), and the chuch burger with poutine (the burger was fabulous, poutine was disappointing- not a lot of gravy).

I would go back and recommend that you visit. For sure try the wings, beets and burger!!"}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I've been here so I thought I'd update my review.  It goes from a 4-star to a 5-star review all thanks to the great service from Mitchell, our server that night.  

Ordered the half-chicken, cauliflower, mixed greens, calamari and the cheesecake for dessert.  The chicken was cooked well and it came with some really great fries.  The cauliflower was good and had a hint of curry for taste.  I really loved the mixed greens. I'm not a huge salad fan but I'd eat this every day.  The calamari was just OK.  I've had better... it was highly breaded and the breading fell apart a lot.

The menu will have something for everyone.  The food is well prepared and there are items great for sharing in large groups.  What really excelled was the service I got as soon as I walked into the door.  People greeted me and I instantly felt like they wanted me there.  Our server, Mitchell was fantastic.  He was quite helpful with our menu choices and answered all our questions. He found answers right away if he needed to ask and he was always attentive to our needs (allergies and sensitivities to dairy).

Mitchell made the experience great.  I would definitely go back and ask to be seated at one of his tables again!"}
{"text":"We stopped for an early dinner after touring around Calgary and viewing the Pride parade. We got a table in the front part of the bar by the windows since it was too cool to sit outside and too light out to be in the dark back section of the restaurant. I ordered the shaved Alberta beef sandwich with horseradish mayo and a very good side salad. We also ordered the flatbread which was excellent. Service was friendly and efficient. A good spot on a street with many other interesting dining choices.

{"text":"The food was very good as was the price point, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. The service wasn't very good. Our server wasn't very knowledgeable and she forgot to enter things in the computer. She only brought out 1/3 our order because she forgot to order the rest. I would have been more understanding if it was dead but there were probably 4 tables that required attention in the restaurant. If you're not in a hurry you'll get a good meal..."}
{"text":"I am in love with Briggs Kitchen's fresh pea soup. It's fresh and green and like summer in a bowl. The service is good, the ambience welcoming and the food a pleasure. We threw my best friend's birthday in their private room and everyone was sharing bites."}
{"text":"Lobster poutine!! It's expensive but we're glad we tried it. The lobster on it was actually a nice change from the regular poutine. 

We ordered some drinks- the strawberry pisco was okay. It wasn't sour enough. We saw 2 couples order the tomahawk and really wanted that but wasn't hungry. Next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  A little bit on the pricy side, but the food is delcious.  I came by here back in September, and, by myself, I was a little too intimidated to get the newf's poutine.  9 months later, here I am and I've finally had it.  And it was worth the wait!

The lowdown?
 - Newf's poutine.  Crab + lobster + poutine.  How could you go wrong?  Absolutely delicious, and worth getting if you've got a group to eat it with.  Or if you just want it all to yourself, no judging.
 - Braised short rib.  Ridicuously huge dish - unbelievably tender on-the-bone short rib on a potato pancake.  It's a lot of food, so come hungry!  I really loved this.

My friend also got the rock crab gnocchi, which was also fantastic.  I'd never had gnocchi before, but I think I'll be trying it more!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The burgers are delicious and the pastas are great as well. I really enjoy the overall ambiance. Perfect for a more laid back date night or hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Downtown restaurant with hip, modern interior and interesting twists on some old continent favorites.  I recommend starting with one of the innovative cocktails on their drinks menu.  I tried the Smoldering Tides, which featured peaty, smoky Laphroaig scotch blended with a fresh lime-ade.  It had never occurred to me to blend the assertive Laphroaig with anything, but somehow this \"adult lemonade\" worked pretty well.

For an appetizer we ordered the crispy blue cheese tart, accompanied by a nice kale and pear salad.  The tart was tangy but not overpowering, and the crust was perfectly flaky.  I also had a few nibbles of my companion's brussel sprouts.  I'm normally not a fan of this vegetable, but this version - with the sprouts pulled apart and blended with honey and bacon bits - was actually not bad.

For dinner I enjoyed the rock crab and ricotta gnocchi -a rich, indulgent dish that was just the right size to satisfy me, but filling enough that I didn't really want dessert after polishing it off.  

The only negative was that the server inexplicably brought our appetizers and dinner all at the same time.  It was a Monday night and the place was not very busy, so maybe the chef wanted to go home early.  Overall, though, Briggs is not a bad choice for a downtown dinner."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place for a late Saturday group dinner, super close to a 5 star but think the service could have been a bit better.  The waitress was friendly enough, but could have been a bit more attentive for drink refills.  As for food, better than I expected:

Caeser salad was huge, seemed like a portion for 3 people, one of the better versions I can remember
Their wings are great, a unique BBQ taste without being drowned in some cheap BBQ sauce, a little small but that seems to normal in Calgary
Mahi mahi was perfect, probably the first thing I would retry when I come back
Short rib was very good, not huge on the look of it but perfectly cooked with very little fat
Brussel sprouts, shredded and tasty
Cauliflower looked so bland but the taste was a pleasant surprise, devoured this side"}
{"text":"Can't here for my brothers bday dinner.

Parking 5/5 lots of parking but is $6 for 2 hours 

Environment 5/5 place is very spacious , clean and the noise wasn't too loud.

Service 5/5 the service was phenomenal our server was friendly , she checked up on us and made sure we enjoyed our dinner. Even the manager came out to see if we had a good time. It's been awhile since I've had great service like this! 

Food 5/5 the food was also great ! We had ceaser salad my favourite! The whole chicken and the steak. Lobster mac & cheese and everything was perfect . 


I defiantly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"The short ribs were delicious. Tender, flavorful and filling. Definitely try some of the cocktails, there was one called Cowboy something. (Forget the name, but a great combination of Wild Turkey, peach schnapps and some citrus in the mix)."}
{"text":"If you're a Top Chef Canada nerd like I am, you would know that Xavier Lacaze, formerly of Muse, is the head chef at Briggs.
I thought we would check this out as it was a special occasion for me and my Fiance. I must say, 5 stars for service. I sent an email a few days before inquiring about a reservation. I promptly received an email back from Cory saying I wouldn't need one, but he gave me his number to call him when we made our way down.

He was right we didn't need a reservation, unless we had wanted to be on the patio. The space is huge and were seated immediately. But I had called ahead of time and he assured me we would be fine.

So as I said service was great, we were immediately greeted at the door, we were then immediately greeted by our serving assistant who dealt with our water(in house filtration system, $2 unlimited water per person), then our waitress came and took our drink orders. Then we ordered and our food was already arriving within 8 minutes. I think it was Cory that came around and checked in on how our meal was 3 times.
The service was so efficient, I was actually a little disappointed. You know when you want the meal to be an experience, well we had cocktails, our meal, dessert and espresso and were paid and out within an hour and ten minutes.
So not much for making the meal and experience, but I guess I should of known since it is called a kitchen and bar, not destination restaurant.

The cocktails were really good, I recommend the 10th ave, the barbaram, the Greg's Marg was also nice, but when it says salted rim I expect a bit more than a smidgen on 1/25 of the rim.
The food was good, especially the lobster mac and cheese, the edamame beans in there is a real nice touch. We just ordered four of the sharing plates and it was sufficient. It's not the most amazing food ever though, not by a long shot. Our dessert was also nice, get the MLF, and we were both treated to a really nice espresso.

So bottom line, amazing service, good food and drinks and you don't need a reservation."}
{"text":"BEST burger in all of Calgary! They also do a share your wine bottle program where if you buy a bottle of wine you can share a glass with someone in the restaurant. Kind of fun, and you'll definitely make someones day!"}
