{"text":"Yummy!  I ordered food for delivery, and it arrived ahead of schedule.  The guy on the phone was very personable, the delivery person courteous.  Afterwards, they called to see if we were satisfied with our food.    I ordered more food than we really needed, so some went in the fridge for the next day.  It was even better the next day.  I will absolutely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We tried to use this resturant to cater to our office. They gave us a quote when we called, but then took 2 months and continuous badgering to get an invoice from them. At this point, we were a couple of days before the event. The invoice had over 150 of extra charges not discussed. The food was late arriving, the deliverer did not have all the equiptment, required people to go help him bring food up (but still charged hefty delivery fee), left the plastic on the trays when put into the food heaters, didnt bring sufficient food for the numbers we requested, and STILL has not given us a reciept of proof of payment. ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT recommend using them for catering."}
{"text":"We came for dinner at 6:00.  Small selection, food was OK, butter chicken was tasty.  Poor service, ten minutes and still waiting for Karen's bubble tea.  Staff walking around, looking busy, but some buffet items are empty and not getting refilled.  One visit is enough, not coming back."}
{"text":"Great location for starters. Didn't look too busy and it was surprising (and unfortunate) when service took longer than normal at all levels. The food was good but that satisfaction quickly got eroded by the lack of service. Would have been nice if I'd been offered a drink (other than water) or asked if I enjoyed the food..."}
{"text":"This wonderful authentic establishment offers a zesty array of delights for your tastebuds! From the famous house favorite Butter Chicken to succulent experiences like Lamb Vindaloo to exotic specialties like Hakka cuisine - a tasty hybrid of Indian-Chinese cuisine. Friendly, knowledgable staff provide a warm ambiance and even the side dishes like fragrant saffron rice & warm fresh naan boast quality high enough to  be entrees of their own! Also, be sure to accompany your hot meal with a tall, cold KIngfisher (Indian beer) - KING SIZE all the way!"}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of Wicked Chili on 17th. From the outside, the look like a run-o-the-mill low-budget Indian food place, but inside waits a great buffet of standard Indian food greats, really attentive servers and the freshest Naan bread you've ever had.   The buffet is $13, which is pretty decent, and though the selection may not be that of, say, Rajdoot, which is a bit further down 4th street and a few dollars more- what this place offers is superb, and the service alone deserves two thumbs up.   I've been to this place a handful of times ( I live and work near by) and would recommend it to anyone. Try it out - support these new business owners and have some really tasty Indian Food while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food - a bit expensive for what you get. Usually these fancy Indian restaurants are not that authentic - not the case here!"}
{"text":"A frustrating and disappointing experience on many levels...  Service:  This place (WC) and the Mexican restaurant (Las Casitas) next to it are effectively one and the same (one odd way to find this out is to go to the WC web site and click on the section titled 'Invest', which will strangely take you to the menu for Las Casitas).   In fact, we (party of 10) were sat in Las Casitas even though we had made reservations for  WC.  Waiters are shared between the two restaurants, even though each waiter typically knows only one side of the menu, so you may initially get a server who can't answer any questions about the side of the menu you're interested in, thus completely slowing down the ordering process.  Because we were seated on the Mexican side, yet with most of us wanting to order Indian, the ordering took a good 20 minutes.  Of the ten orders we placed, fully four were completely botched.  In one case, a vegetarian was served lamb vindaloo, and in another (which could only happen here), someone who had ordered Indian was brought a burrito!  By the time everyone was properly served (well, almost properly - some appetizers were never brought out), nearly an hour had elapsed since orders had been initially taken, and the flatbreads and rice on the table had gone cold and dry.  Food:  Not terrible, but certainly didn't even begin to compensate for the horrendous service.  Like many (most?) Indian restaurants, the food was too rich, both in texture and in flavor.  This is the sort of food that lingers on the palate and in the belly for far too long after it has been consumed.  My fish curry was overwhelmed by a powerful spice that I couldn't place, and the chicken jalfrezi I tried simply had too much of everything in it (and was creamier than it should have been).  Overall, not an enjoyable dining experience.  The lunch buffet may not be quite as disappointing, since at least the opportunity for poor service is minimized, but I certainly won't be returning..."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet. Decent little establishment. Price was fair and the food tasted good. The selection wasn't that great and that's the justification of only getting a 3 star review. On a plus side, the atmosphere was really good as was the service. I couldn't understand why it was't busier although the Mexican buffet right next door was hopping."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a solid \"meh\".  I ordered take out through Waiters En Route and although the food arrived cold I don't think hot would have made a difference.  The pakoras were burnt to the point of charred, the veggie butter dish (like butter chicken) was gloopy and weird tasting and the chicken vindaloo was watery and it too tasted burnt and out of a can. I LOVE Indian food and very rarely have I had food this disappointing. I'll be sticking to Namscar from now on!  MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"Awful place. I went here with my two brothers, and like many people, we were armed with the Living Social coupons. Now, I don't like to brag, but my brothers are reasonable experts in the many provincial flavours of Indian cuisine, so I will divide this review into two portions: my brothers' thoughts and my own.  First, my own. So, this is a weird little place seeing as how it shares space with a very Mexican themed restaurant, including murals of Tenochitlan, and the Golden Eagle. Does Wicked share a space with this mysterious restaurant? Did I walk into the middle of a hostile take-over? I don't know. It was just so weird.  Service is slow, except for the nice bus boy, who brought us menus promptly, poured us water etc... Then it took about 10 minutes for the waiter to come to our table, another 10 minutes to get our order in, and then about 30-40 minutes for our food to arrive. I was hungry, I didn't like this waiting.   But the staff was friendly, even the crappy slow waiter. He even smiled when I didn't give him a tip. Can I go back now? Will I go back? No.  Next the food, and my brothers' thoughts. Expensive. Indian food is cheap to make, but because of the current yuppie infatuation with Indian, any place in a decent spot, ie. 17th, will have a big mark-up.   Back to me: Dishes were around $10, and the portions were so tiny that divying up portions between the three of us became some sort of evolutionary competitive confrontation. We snarled, we bared our teeth to get our scrap of food from the tiny carcasses of food we were served.  I don't really remember what we ordered; two veg's and a meat dish, definitely the Chole Palak. I can make Chole Palak, it's easy. Just pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and spinach. And I can make it pretty good with the spices I buy from T&T. This was not good chole palak. It had the consistency of Prego spaghetti sauce steeped in old tea water. It splashed onto my plate with all the delicacy of the Delhi Belly.  What was worse, as mentioned above, is this ordeal took over two hours from start to finish. Even the bill took 20 minutes to arrive. The total for 3 people, ordering 3 dishes with two rices was $48. Pricey, as I can go down to Mirchi and get 6 dishes for $40.  You suck, Wicked Chili, but I have one more of these goddam Living Social coupons to use, so I'll probably be back, but only as a matter of self-punishing bourgeois principle. Damn my Protestant upbringing."}
{"text":"They've closed for good, though were selling Groupons even weeks AFTER they closed for supposedly renovations.  I knew things were going badly, but to deliberately defraud calgarians?"}
{"text":"Okay, so, Kincora and Evanston are pretty new communities almost out in the boonies, but that doesn't mean the area is a bare wasteland.  It's full of stores and restaurants, one of which is Wicked Chili.  This place is kind of cool since they have an on-going lunch and dinner buffet.  Tell me, what's better than filling your own plate with whatever you want as many times as you can for under $15?  That's right!  Almost nothing.   They've even got a Tuesday special of $10.  It's pretty wicked, if you ask me.  And the food is pretty decent.  Actually, it's better than decent.  I was so full of different delicious food after I left this place I thought I was going to need a nap.  I'm not even joking when I say I ate so much that my brain was actually tired from telling my stomach to stop putting food in it.  I just couldn't help myself, I had to keep eating!  Since I went for the buffet there wasn't much involved in the service department, and yet our waitress was attentive and friendly.  She brought out drinks almost immediately after we ordered them and was quick to refill the empties.  All-in-all, Wicked Chili was a great choice for lunch and I'm going to try my damndest to make it back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"I was here recently for a networking event (if you are a businessperson, and want to host an event, you will need to contact the owner via the phone number on their website). It was a surprisingly small and quiet place, but one thing I noticed was that when you first walk in, there's Indian to your right, and Mexican to your left. That is a unique choice. We opted for the Indian side, and the man who served our table was very friendly. We got our drinks in old-fashioned bottles, and then we ordered butter chicken over basmati rice and naan, and boy was it gooood. I had 3 helpings (not like me). We were too full for dessert, but the menu seemed to offer some interesting items there. I did, however, notice our two menus varied slightly in prices, so I think it's the higher-priced one that will get honored when you order. Just one of those things. This place is a perfect combination of elegant and casual, with moderate prices and addictive food :d"}
