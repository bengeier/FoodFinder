{"text":"Hands down the best Chicken Schwarma I had ever tasted ...... Been there over 20 times and I still go there whenever I can.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"If overpriced crunchy break your teeth little pieces of crunchy chicken are what your looking for, look no further. Overcooked or sitting around for so long it's translucent and runs about $10 for the combo. They have a nice selection of cold flavourless pastas for you to choose from. These guys must be making a killing. Schwarma was also quite smaller in size then the ones I get downtown for $4-$6. Don't even bother"}
{"text":"way overpriced.   They are just capitalizing on the location having no competition.   I have been sold uncooked chicken here more than once."}
{"text":"Sam catered for my daughter's wedding and we can say It was outstanding food commended by every guest. Thank you"}
{"text":"By far,  Sam's has the best falafel around. I've tried many others and I keep coming back here. They're not dry, as someone else commented. They're fresh daily. The shawarma is juicy and yes, there are crispy bits, but they intensify the flavour.   My only real complaint....and it's not a huge deal...is that they have switched from Coca-Cola products to Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food! I wasn't expecting much, but the server plated our food so well and we were treated fantastically. Don't judge a book by its cover, the outside doesn't do it justice. You need to try the lentil soup and shish tahou with brown rice."}
{"text":"Love the food here!  It's close to my office so I order from Sam's often.  I love the lady that runs this place with her family...she's pleasant and patient.  The man at the cash...I find him a little abrupt but he's not rude, so ok.   Now, I've always found them pricey.  But recently...they raised their prices and I find that with that; it's put them over my threshold of unfair now.  I often order their Chicken on Salad and was willing to pay the $10+ for it...they only have one size...it's large, but remember it's lettuce and chicken....  Now that very same salad is $11.49 plus tax.  It's still lettuce and chicken and I didn't enjoy it since the girl dressing my salad didn't really take much care in how she did it....sloppy.  Now regarding the new price - I feel that if you're going to charge those types of prices, you should at least offer more than one size to give people the option. Traffic is heavy throughout the week at this place, so it's not like they're hurting and can't offer more to the people that support their restaurant.  **i may be off on the pricing by pennies...sorry."}
{"text":"After circulating this place for years in the GTA and never steeping foot inside, I finally decided to take our business lunch here today. You would think that with my addiction to shawarma, I'd have scoped this place out a lot sooner!  The first thing I immediately noticed was the size of the restaurant, it's HUGE for a shawarma joint, so getting a table is literally no prob! Also, the cleanliness of it was well kept too. As soon as the dial on the clock hit 12' noon, the line got fairly long and customers came pouring in. I will say though that they've got a good organization set in place which makes the inflow of traffic work, allowing patrons to order their meals rather quick.   I ordered the chicken shawarma combo which comes with a choice of one of five side salads; I choose the tabbouleh and a drink. The shawarma was okay, tabbouleh decently refreshing.   The chicken was seasoned, but boy it was cold. I'm SURE it would have tasted A LOT better if the chicken was warmer. Most shawarma joints carve the chicken right in front of you and then add it into your pita. At Sam's they already have the chicken sliced off from the rotating spit in a heated stainless steel buffet along with falafel and beef in others. I definitely believe this was a contributing factor to the cold chicken (among the falafel, beef, etc.); however, I can also understand that by doing this they are able to serve their patrons a lot quicker. The pita unfortunately, felt and tasted stale too. I got usual shawarma toppings: tabbouleh, tahini, hummus, pickled turnips, and of course, EXTRA garlic yogurt sauce and a drizzle of hot sauce!  Summing Up: Shawarma's are seriously a hit-or-miss. Sam's, not bad but rather a decent shawarma restaurant when in the Dixie area.  3 stars for good organization, friendly staff, and a relatively simple decently priced menu with only so many options to choose from. I'm sure to give Sam's another shot. My quest for the next great shawarma continues!"}
{"text":"This little Shwarma joint is busy not because it's a crowd pleaser, but because there's not much selection on the block. We all agree it's overpriced. The chicken is always dry. Same goes for their falafel's The lunch crowd is pretty big anytime after 12pm. Expect to wait about 10 +minutes...if you can find a parking spot and actually make it in.  But...it has one thing: food and it is right there....and they take Debit/credit cards.  Their salads are surprisingly tasty and fresh, and they have a nice big fridge for super cold drinks. Still not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place wins the BEST OF for Lebanese food in the area.  Destroys the competition and made to order (just like a sub shop).   Quality food and friendly service.  Two things that go a long way.     You're my new Schwarma joint Sam.  See you again soon friends.   Take out or eat in."}
{"text":"Best pita place in all of the GTA. Been there like 30 times for  lunch, was great every time."}
{"text":"Due to proximity to work, I've been here a few times, the last time I went, was probably the worst.  I've had a hard time getting over it to go back (they had a new employee who literally fingered my food -eww).  So, I've given up on trusting the sanitation of the place.  However, the food is ok.  I liked their falafel, kefta, etc.  I may try"}
{"text":"Good serving, it was empty at 530 there were no customers maybe that is why the chicken was already cold hence the deducted stars. would i eat here again? maybe if stuck in the area. seasoning was good on the chicken itself just cold a little to dry from being in the food warmer! again it was too close to closing time. i like supporting family businesses and the place was clean!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pita.  The lamb was succulent.  Warm, pressed and with the perfect sauce ratio.  Great mid day meal.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Sam's pita is a GREAT place to eat but there's a few strings attached that others mentioned. Sam's is my favourite place in the area for lunch and I even come on the weekends when I'm not working. The food is great and the chicken shawarma is the absolute best platter I've ever had. I've tried many other shawarma places and none match the platter. It's genuinely incredible, and they give generous portions and as much sauce as you ask for. There are a couple drawbacks sadly.   1 - try to avoid going at lunch because it is PACKED 2 - don't go late in the day or else the food is reheated or something. Try to go around mid day.  3 - it is a bit expensive!  All in all, still my favourite place for anything close to shawarma. Delicious."}
