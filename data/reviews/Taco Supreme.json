{"text":"i would give this NO starts if yelp let me. this place is absolutely awful. some of the vegetables in my salad were rotten -- tasted and smelled gross and mouldy. the owne offered to partly reimburse me. the whole place was very dirty and disorganized. seriously, skip this dirthole if you can. the owner Lee doesn't care about her business at all and is serving unsafe food."}
{"text":"Sometimes, between two meetings, you need something quick for the lunch time. Of course, this is a Mexican fast food so I was not expecting to have the most astonish meat ever, but I was expecting a bit more.  Situated in the Montreal Eaton Centre, Taco Supreme is part of the food area of the shopping center. The food was OK, but they put it in the microwave before giving it to me. This is the last things I'm expecting from a restaurant when I'm paying for food: using the microwave to warm my food. Just for this, it's a no-go for me. At least the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good! I mean obviously don't expect the food to be top notch. It is a Mexican fast food restaurant in a mall. But I was really feeling like a burrito while I was shopping and this place hit the spot! There aren't that many good fast food Mexican places around here. I would recommend it.   Prices are fair and the staff is nice."}
