{"text":"Rolbertos is bomb.com!!! 
They have the best food / the best ice cream"}
{"text":"Best fast Mexican in Mesa! It looks a little rough around the edges, but the food is amazing and the service is great. We grab Rolberto's about once a week, and I've never tried anything that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Oh my what a great little spot for late night Mexican food, beef tacos were the bomb, chicken burrito, quesadillas awesome stop by and try it!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I found ourselves venturing for food in Mesa right before a concert. We had decided on the trip up to stop at Adrian's because it looked like a dive we'd love. When got there, Adrian's was closed (I think for good?), so it was back on the road for some impromptu decisions. 

As we were nearing Mesa Amphitheatre, one friend yelled out, \"Turn left here!\" And so we did as we pulled into the parking lot at Rolbertos. My first impression, perfect. Rolbertos is nothing but a very small building consisting of an order window and a kitchen with a small patio to the side, the quintessential dive. Their menu is off to the side by the street on what looks like a drive-thru menu board. They have combo plates, individual orders, sides, and drinks. Out of everything they had, 2 tacos stood out to me: the lengua and the cabeza. As a newbie in the Southwest, I had yet to try these two meats, and I knew that Rolbertos would be the first. 

The 4 of us ordered, and our dishes came out at the same time with a relatively short wait time. After we took our first bites, we all agreed that we made an awesome decision in stopping here. It was exactly what you would want from a place like this. Even though I've never had lengua or cabeza before, I knew that they were out of this world! Good thing I don't live in Mesa, or I would be eating here every day of the week!"}
{"text":"Staff is extremely SLOW but their food is sooooo worth the wait!!!! Street chicken mini tacos are the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place has got some great tasting salsas!!!
Its not watered-down like filibertos. So if you like spicy hottt you gotta try the red it has lotts of flavor and moth burning.  The green is just as good  but not as hot. The service is always quick they give unlimited waters probably because they know how hottt that salsa can be lol.... workers are also kind and friendly no matter what time of day it is this place will make that fresh mexican food to satisfy your cravings because they are open 24 hrs a day 7 days a week trust me you'll never be disappointed in their food unless you prefer fake mexican food this is not the place to stop by."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie burrito at 1:20am and it was amazing! It had beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, ect and it tasted fresh and was filled with flavor. I asked the guy at the drive thru for the hottest hot sauce and he gave me the red one. That sauce has to be of the best sauces I've had in years. I will be coming back for more veggie burritos in the future. I would have given them 5 stars but I had to knock a star off cause when I asked for a plate for my burrito they tried to charge me $1 for it. I ate it without a plate and tried my best not to make a mess in the car even though I soaked the burrito in red hot sauce."}
{"text":"While staying in Mesa for business, I found this little gem and decided to give it a shot! It was within walking distance from my hotel and I was craving real taqueria food...a breakfast burrito to be exact. All the other places in the area had terrible reviews except for this one. The menu was vast and although the building was small, the breakfast burrito I ordered was massive!!! Not to me mention, delicious!!! The hot sauces were even tasty! The green sauce was too spicy for me but the red sauce was just right! The kitchen and order taking area were clean and the staff was friendly! I'm sad I didn't eat here more! I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Omg the food at this place was amazing. The green Chile burritos were so flavorful and the sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place sucks... I had a gift certificate for $25 off and they refused to accept it. They are horrible and their rolled tacos are always soggy. I went there because I had the certificate and when they decided they weren't going to honor it I left. I would avoid this place they are rude and rediculous. They don't hardly get business and then turn away the little bit they do get.. WOW. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Went down the street to a real Mexican food place Filibertos on main."}
{"text":"Affordable, great food, convenient to downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"5 stars, to offset my unduly low 3 star review from last year.. ROLBERTO'S TAKES CREDIT CARDS!!!!!! NO MORE HAVING TO HIT THE ATM FIRST! HOLLER!! ALSO, now that I've fully fallen into the dark world of tacos, Rolberto's has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST Carnitas, and Adobada in the area... Where as most similar places of this type serve an obviously processed, previously frozen iteration of carnitas and adobada, Rolberto's seems far more genuine and homemade. Also, it's very much a family owned/operated type place, and I just love the hell out of it!!! So glad it's so close to my house!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled on this place after we went to a Mesa museum. We were hungry and everything was closed because it was a Sunday. This great taco truck uses fresh ingredients! I got a carnita taco and it was so tasty and very cheap. Great tortilla and the pork was awesome. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my go to fast Mexican food place.  They are open late, always friendly and have good fresh food.  I've never gotten anything bad here.   No inside seating so I usually go through the drive-thru in summer months but when it is cooler the patio is nice.  Light rail construction is finishing up in front of them which has had to hurt their business but now it is easy to get in and out.  Their prices are very reasonable as well."}
