{"text":"This Cici's has the best service ever! They will make a special order for you at any time. Customer service is excellent. My kids enjoy visiting this Cici's!"}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I hate buffets. I only went here because my BF's son wanted it so bad. When we got here the place was slightly packed for a Saturday night. There was little to no pizza on the buffet, so there was a wait for everything. The cook explained he had a lot of to go orders so he was behind. But for the 30 to 45 mins we were there he was behind the whole time. They also have a build your own pizza, for free.. he told me that was behind 20 to 30 mins. We grabbed what we could when the pizza came out since he was behind everyone was waiting... and the pizza went fast. We will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"There was a time when this location was a decent place to get an inexpensive lunch - not the best pizza in town, but not the worst by any means...but over the past few years they have gone downhill. Little things like eliminating some of the more premium items from the salad bar, eliminating the cafeteria trays, allowing wear and tear to get the best of the seating, and of late, making it a \"bus your own table\" place. The last straw for me was when they discontinued the \"buy 9, get the 10th free\" card program, leaving me with an almost full loyalty pass never to be redeemed. Good customer service would have been to take my card and offer me a free buffet for my loyalty - or at least a discount. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't come expecting the buffet to have pizza on it. Totally empty except one pizza. No dessert pizzas out. They wait to cook after you request. I know you shouldn't expect much for 6 bucks but have something to choose from. Came for the new stuffed crust pizza that has a commercial every 10 mins. Had to ask to have one made. I'll be driving to rock hill and try that one I guess next time."}
