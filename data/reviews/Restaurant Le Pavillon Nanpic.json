{"text":"Excellent and friendly service. More formal than your typical Area Chinese restaurant. Veggies were very fresh and all food prepared well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was typical western greasy salty chinese good.  Food is overpriced for quality.  Wait staff were slow and uncaring.  They told us how much we should tip after ignoring us for most of the meal.  I almost had to get up to refill my own water at least once.  After they saw our tip the waiter threw the receipt at my wife and starting foul mouthing us to his colleague in Chinese in front of us.

It was painfully obvious what they were talking about.  Also my friend speaks Chinese and understood what they were saying.  Definitely avoid this place."}
{"text":"Cozy, clean restaurant with delicious food and house wines by the glass (or bottles, if you prefer). This spot is hidden away in the basement and has an a la carte menu as well as prix fixe offerings for one or two people.

We had the ravioli in peanut sauce and the large dim sum platter, which was amazing. I could have eaten a whole plate of the shrimp toasts. For our main course, we shared the Peking duck, and it was the best we've ever had. The duck is carved at the table and served with mini pancakes and spring onions. Once you're finished with that, they bring a new dish to you: the duck breast is sauteed with vegetables in a light sauce with the wings and legs arranged along the edges of the plate. We just went last weekend, and can't wait to go again this weekend."}
{"text":"I think the best part of the meal was when the waiter argued with us over whether or not we ordered 3 bowls of rice (for 3 people).

Skip this one folks..."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Expecting to eat something rather tasty, but turned out to be pretty disappointing expereince. The ambiance, and the service was really good, however the food was not up to par. Not very authentic."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss.  Is in the basement.  I went for lunch, ate the general Thai and quite enjoyed it.

Atmosphere is mediocre, what I would expect for the area, service was very good.

I think I will Try one more spot in China town this week as I still haven't found my gem in the rough there...

Accepts Amex, which I always like."}
