{"text":"Amazing friendly staff, greeted with a smile and jokes each time. Very delicious lunches, convenient location for me"}
{"text":"I typically don't go through the trouble of writing a review however wanted to share the worst customer experience from this place. I called up one day to get an order for pickup and the owner picked up and asked how many sandwiches I would like. I said one for pickup. His response was rude / abrupt, don't bother me with these little orders, come in and i will make the sandwich for you, then hung up. I was stunned at the tone and definitely was not giving him my business. On my way to the next restaurant, I had to pass by his store and I stopped by to let him know I was the one he hung up on and advised him he should have better phone manners and be more polite when answering phone calls. I have no idea what he's going on at the restaurant or how his business is run. He pretty much took exception and picked up where he left off. I wasn't even rude to him or raising my voice. This basically took place 5 minutes after he had hung up as I don't live far and there was nobody in his store. He told me that he makes a quality product but does not offer any sort of white glove service for a deli. I would understand where he was coming from if store was busy but it wasn't. If it was so busy, why pick up the phone and answer like a jackass. I'm sorry, but for a mom and pop shop, I wish him all the best but will not be giving him any business nor will I even consider giving an opportunity to redeem himself. If I could give him zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Okay for a quick bite.  Remember that the sandwiches do not look like those in the advertisement pictures."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and kept driving past us. Couldn't make it up to Wolfie's so we stopped in and I was hoping. Excellent smoked meat, loved the pics on the wall. My better half loved it and had it with mustard. I'd definitely go back - love the fact it's a two chain location. The service was great."}
{"text":"The Original Ruben wasn't good!   The Ruben was only toasted only on one side of the rye bread!     The meat was cold,  the cheese and sauerkraut was almost non existent.   Then they topped it off with what they call there \"special homemade  Russian  sauce\" ..........it tasted like Russian Salad dressing from Kraft. Besides tasting really bad, it made the Ruben wet and soggy.   Although, my Dog seemed to enjoy it after I failed to eat it!    The one star was for my dog Sammy."}
{"text":"Slow grumpy service.  OK food but not worth making a trip for.   Avoid the macaroni salad its really bland."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat and friendly service, but not a sandwich worth $10. Think of a ham sandwich with processed cheese and ketchup then add more ham. The flavor is mostly \"salt\" and the pickles are mushy."}
{"text":"Great place......great food, you go to a deli for that and that alone.  Deli's  are known not to have the greatest service....it's a small place and gets pretty busy and chaotic in there.  Excellent bang for the buck.  I heard they opened another location in Scarborough last week......I guess majority rules here and they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Went to jodys w a couple of co workers today.  Sandwiches were good but overpriced.   We realized later the attendant give us a small sandwich, never packed our drinks...he even forgot our forks for the coleslaw.   What an idiot.  Never going back."}
{"text":"For Montreal ex-pats Toronto has long been a smoked meat desert....sure theres Centre St Deli with their \"Lesters\" meat and high prices and Caplankys which despite having had a great start at The Monarch has now become inconsistent and super pricey with skinny dry fries but otherwise nothing a Montrealer would even consider...until today that is....I was in the east end and decided to check Yelp to see what was around me for lunch.....I came across Jodys Montreal Deli.....wow! This is smoked meat heaven.....not only do they smoke their briskets in house for 16 hours but their hand cut fries and homemade coleslaw make their sandwich platter at $10.99 one of the best deals in Toronto.When I called to see if they were open for lunch the surley response I got I took as  good sign.....reminiscent of the waiters at Schwartz's in the old days...my only mistake was that I forgot to ask for my meat to be sliced \"old fashioned\"and ended up with a machine sliced sandwich which was entirely my own fault.Jody is really an interesting guy who runs the place like a swiss watch with his son.....if you want someone to kiss your ass go elsewhere but if you crave a great smoked meat sandwich...look no further....."}
{"text":"Just tried this place this past week, out of the blue. Wow, what a delicious smoked meat sandwich. I had the original reuben sandwich on rye, and absolutely no complaints. It was delicious and I only wish I would have gotten a side as it's not overly huge. I like what they have going on here and I'll be visiting on the regular."}
{"text":"WOW! Amazing and AUTHENTIC Montreal smoked meat sandwhiches.  This place is amazing. One regular sandwhich leaves you full and stuffed. And a jumbo? Well lets just say you wont be eating again anytime soon or even for the rest of the day. So when you wanna break the norm and eat/think free then put down your run of the mill subway subs, tell Mr Sub to sit down and head over to Jody's for one of the best sandwhiches this city has to offer!"}
{"text":"The coleslaw was gross. The sandwich was gross. The entire meal was over $20. The service took us a long time to be served.  I'd rather not come back here again but it's entirely possible I was disappointed because I was expecting a Philly Cheese Steak but all I got was a lousy Reuben."}
{"text":"Juicy, not dry, Montreal Smoked meat. Wish they had French fries but the pickles were crispy and service great.  Found it by accident.   Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Outside of Montreal this is the best smoked meat I have had. The restaurant is modest and the service nice."}
{"text":"The father is a jerk. I will never go back there again.  He gave me some lecture about the ttc ?  And ignored my order while he served a ttc guy who just stopped his streetcar in front of the place.   Ur smoked meat is the same crap I can get from loblaws.  Until u start smokin it yourself ur fake and rude.  I left."}
{"text":"Passed by Jody's Deli a few times, and today my BF and I decided to give it a try.  Casual but clean, Jody's would be great for a quick lunch or dinner, and offer take-out as well as table service.  He had the Big Smoke and I tried the California, both grilled Reuben sandwiches that came with fresh cut fries, dill pickle wedges and cole slaw.    Sandwiches were generously stacked with mega and garnishes, and my BF who usually does not like deli was very happy.  The only negative was that he had hoped for a bit more kick (it's described in spicy terms).  My California was delish, but would prefer a real mayo option to the dressing (Miracle Whip) it was served with.  The fries were unbelievably good, perfectly seasoned, nicely cooked, and addictively crispy.  BF left thinking that they were a close contender for Best Fries Ever!  Fast, friendly service and great food - we will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here was dying for brisket but got Montreal smoked meat combo with fries and drink.Akmost 15 bucks. The sandwich was hearty meat flavourfull but a little on the fatty side. Fries looked delicious  fresh cut and brown but extremely under cooked to the point could not eat  them and threw them out. I love deli and live in area so I will give it one more  try. Oh yea combo came with coleslaw and picKel which were both  delicious."}
{"text":"Jody's deli - excellent deli sandwiches, nice hand cut fries and really good pickles. That pretty well sums it all up.   I have been wanting to try Jody's for awhile but not often home around lunch time. My daughter and I went today and it was very good. The sandwiches are nice, moist and delicious. I had the cheddar smokehouse beef which was excellent.   The service was exceptional friendly and warm. It is little things like that that make you want to go back and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent meat but stale bread.  I'm tired of going to places that don't want to buy fresh bread because they have leftovers.  Do i get a discount for day old bread...no so spring for fresh bread daily. Can't return or recommend. The wait was long too.  Overall if you read so.e reviews you can see the trend.  Long Waits and stale bread means owners are Try I g to hard to save money instead of offering a great experience...short term gain over long term success."}
{"text":"I had the corned beef with slaw & chips, the wife had a roast beef with slaw & chips. Mine was alright, nothing special; hers was mediocre. I think the place is situated in an area ( on purpose ) ....  that most people aren't often likely exposed to this type of food; so perhaps they may think it's better than it really is...... because they don't know any better.  I've been to many deli's that blow this joint away; the service at the counter is .. awkward; the place has zero personality. I won't be running to get back anytime soon ."}
{"text":"Don't let the construction discourage from walking up from Queen St. Great deli and food!  Memories of Schwartz's deli from Montreal. Great Smoked meat sandwiches were had!! Pickles were delcious. They also have pastrami and corned beef and a few more choices. $7.99 for a large sized sandwich. The deli is cute and clean. The owner said they also have a location in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, but the problem here is really the pace of service. With only 1 person making sandwiches during the weekday lunch hour, I find it hard to recommend coming here unless you come at 11:30 or if you want to wait 25 minutes for a deli sandwich - not my idea of a good time.   The sandwich is 4 star flavor, but the wait and slowness drops it down a star for me"}
{"text":"First time there this evening.  Been wanting to try it for ages.  I had the smoked meat sandwich on a baguette.  It was delicious.  Looking back I wish I went for rye, but there is always next time.  The portion was decent, and it was quite tasty. I've only had the smoked meat sandwich from picklebarrel to compare, and found this one to be a tad dryer and smaller then picklebarrel's.  However, having something this good so close to home is a bonus.  Didn't try their fries yet.  I can't compare to other places, but did find it slightly pricey, but maybe most places like this are comparable?    Either way, loved the sandwich and will be coming back.  Everything on the menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"Wanted something quick for lunch and decided to try this place out. When I walked in it took a little long for someone to see I was waiting at the counter to order even with the place empty. About 5 minutes went by and the person realized I was there.   I wanted to order the Honolulu sandwich but I was told they didn't have any pineapples.. So I settled for just a regular corned beef sandwich with a traditional poutine.  Overall, the food was good for something quick while on lunch, but I wasn't happy about the service given.  If I ever feel like eating at this particular place I think I might just go through uber eats."}
{"text":"Their Montreal smoke meat isn't good, messed up our order, not friendly. The only thing good there are the fries. I don't recommend this restaurant. If you want best montreal meat sandwiches i suggest the ones in montreal."}
{"text":"Was really really disappointed tonight with the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. It was made up of thicker chunks of meat...certainly not the shaved that my husband got on his Corned Beef.  My sandwich was relatively small with it's chunks and his was nicely thick as it should have been.  By the way I have been there before and had a shaved Montreal Smoked meat.  We went at 7:30 pm and they were closing at 8:00 pm. So we decided to get them to go.  I am SURE I got leftovers to make up my sandwich.  This put me right off Jody's and I doubt I will ever return. If you don't have the proper product to make a proper sandwich then customer should be notified.  Chunks taste totally different than shaved."}
{"text":"terrible,  bland paper thin meat slicer sliced mtl smoked meat that largely resembles generic grocery deli counter varieties ungenerously piled between rye,  $24 for one combo + extra sandwich, ridiculous,  never heard of this chain and now I know why,  don't bother"}
{"text":"The Dixie Road - Eglinton has really become a hub for new places in Mississauga. Chipotle Grill just opened,  Sunset breakfast, and a host of new places. Jody's Delhi seems to be getting all the buzz. For lunch on the weekdays expect long lineups since  it's a small place and hardly seating for more than a dozen people. Takeout might work better  So when in Rome ... I came for the Montreal smoked meat. So that's what I had but without the fries on dark rye &  mustard.  Not bad but definitely not the best I've ever had either. The portion was a tad small and the soggy pickle was a sad disappointment is being generous. I will definitely return to assess the quality throughout the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Tried to place an order over the phone. The guy hung up on me before I could finish the order. Then when I arrived at the restaurant for pick up the food I tried to add fries to the order and the guy barked at me: \"too late.\"  \"But you hung up on me before I could finish,\" I replied  His answer: \"too late. Go to MacDonalds!\"  I walked out. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The fries are fantastic and the roast beef is good. We will definitely get lunch from here again."}
{"text":"The BEST corn beef sandwich you will ever have bar none. I have tried many places around Toronto and Jody's is the best. Their roast beef and Rubens is worth a try also. And their pickles are incredible. I could eat a jar, which they sell there, but my blood pressure wouldn't be happy.  My only complaint? No pumpernickel bread."}
{"text":"This place feels like the only people who go here work nearby and don't have other options. It was okay but not really worth the price.  I had the pastrami sandwich - it was okay. The coleslaw was good. Boyfriend decided to go healthy and got a sliced turkey sandwich and it was bland and dry. Disappointing. I thought with so many other food places in the area that this might be a little gem, but sadly I was mistaken."}
{"text":"Ok, let's be honest here. Most have not had Caplanskys, and truthfully, it's good, but it is just another rushed American deli. Jody's does a wonderful job of appealing to the true sandwich foody, especially when there is a huge void in Toronto. Their Ruben sandwich is knock your socks off and slap your neighbor great. I have brought friend and relatives and they all rave that the food is true deli artwork. There new location on Warden and Eglinton is a bit off the beat and path, but it's spacious and allows for lots of room to fight the sandwich down.  You will certainly enjoy the adventure!"}
{"text":"Way to many black little flys all over the place! Walked in and noticed the flys and walked out! All was near cash and garbage."}
{"text":"Caplansky's this ain't. The meat IS imported from Montreal, but I would be very surprised from 'that place in Montreal' that made Montreal Smoked Meat famous, you know? It was sliced thin, very lean and juicy but the texture is more coldcut than Caplansky's. I had the \"Jody's Jumbo\" which is apparently over 1/2lb. of sliced meat. That sammy is too much for one person, or if shared, too much for 2 pieces of bread.  So, 1. have something other than the \"Jumbo\" 2. Don't bring expectations, this is middle-of-nowhere Kingston Road"}
{"text":"I'll be honest I probably didn't make a good choice;  my first selection was off the menu so I made a quick second choice of the 'Big Smoke' Reubens.  Hot peppers, hot mustard and cholula hot sauce was really too overpowering for a smoked meat sandwich IMO. Anyway the meat itself was pretty good but at $9 for a sandwich felt overpriced because it may be called 'large' but that's stretching things a bit I think.  I didn't get any fries but I cadged* some off by brother in law and they were good home made fries well cooked without being spectacular.  I'd go again if I was in the area but won't be making a special trip across town.       *NE English dialect word meaning in this example 'begged for some'"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and fresh garden salad, really fresh and smells good good. i have been going to this place over a year, great place to hang out with friends and enjoy the fresh food."}
{"text":"$25 for a combo (sandwich, coleslaw, fries), one sandwich, 2 cans of pop....a little pricey. We didn't like the slaw or the pickles. The sandwiches were tasty and a manageable size, compared to other deli's where you can't get your mouth around them. Mainly a take-out joint, though there are a few tables."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in the area for lunch and were initially walking over to the Nando's next door, when we noticed the signs on the windows for smoked meat. We both enjoy smoked meat, but haven't found a great place here to get any. Caplansky's downtown was just ok (imo).   The place was very clean, excellent customer service, and you could taste every ingredient. I ordered the \"Montreal Meats NY\" sandwich from the MTL Smoked Meats section.  Hands down, new favourite smoked meat place."}
{"text":"I know everyone says it's as good as Schwartz's but really it's not.  They do have more choices and their fries are good, but it's not the same as Schwartz's and Caplansky's.  I'll go here again if I am really craving some smoked meat and don't want to go to Caplansky's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my boyfriend in the summer of 2014. I was very happy when it popped up as there were no other nearby places to get smoked meat. It wasn't busy when we went, but that might be because it was around 4:30pm.   The portion sizes were good and the fries were SO AMAZING! Honestly I think the fries were the most surprising part of the meal. You get free coleslaw with your sandwhich if you want it. We both got the Montreal smoked meat both times we went.   There is a bit of seating (5-6 tables) inside but we always got it to go.   It might be hard to find parking if you go during peak hours (lunch?) as the plaza is pretty small. There is a small side lot though."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sandwich. Had the Philly. Service was friendly and the place appeared clean. Would recommend. Been here a few times now and love this place. Good portions, fresh with great service."}
{"text":"I have been to Jody's Deli in Scarborough a few a years ago and loved the sandwich that I had ordered there. I wasn't on Yelp at the time. I would have to go through my large photo collection to find out what I had ordered. Yes, I enjoy taking photos of my food, even back then!  This location is close to my workplace. I noticed it when I exited Starbucks a couple of months or so. I knew that I had to visit it.   It was a Saturday afternoon. The store has clearly labelled signs as to where to go to place your order when you walk in. I went with the Philly (roast beef) combo. You get your choice of deli salad. It also comes with fried and a pickle wedge.   I'm not a pickle person. I love cucumbers and relish, but not pickles. The fries were salty at the beginning of munching on them. They were yummier once the salt had died.  The sandwich was good, except that the bread was soggy as I ate through it. The bread was toasted a bit. Perhaps if it were more toasted and I didn't order a Philly would make me grab onto the sandwich better. The sandwich was also too salty for my liking, which I didn't experience at the other location.   I liked what I had when I first visited this franchise. I'll need to tear through the remaining items on the menu to find outwhat are my favourite food items here. I'd come back again and will adjust my review accordingly when I have eaten my way through the menu.  (54)"}
{"text":"Always consistent. Just be careful if you go to close to closing time, it's best to call in advance because they run out of food."}
{"text":"Have gone here twice and tried the smoked meat and roast beef sandwiches. Preferred the smoke meat for sure. The sandwich combos are filling, with fries, slaw and a pickle. They load up the sandwiches with meat and a little mustard to your liking. I would come back again and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Friday lunch rush with a colleague. Ordered the Montreal meets NY sandwich which I must say was very tasty. The toppings on the sandwich were flavourful and the smoked meat was fantastic. The combo included delicious fries and a choice of a side salad. I decided on the macaroni salad and was not disappointed. Overall the food was amazing however the wait for our food was a little longer than anticipated for the amount of people in the restaurant. Will be coming back to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Had a good lunch here today, got the Montreal Meats NY sandwich as a combo with macaroni salad and fries. Next time I would go without the fries. They were nothing special. The sandwich was good and so was the macaroni salad, which tasted very fresh. Pickle was tasty and crunchy."}
{"text":"the food i've had from here is good: fries, turkey sandwich, beef sandwich. but the service has been awful most times (not every time though). owner being downright snappy/rude/impatient with ppl for no reason just makes me stay away. Unfortunate because i live so close and often Want to go. Last time i tried to go in and order, the owner was lecturing the guy in front of me \"to never call here. i wont answer. i'm too busy.' The poor guys face went red with embarrassment as he paid by debit. Owner turned away to make his order i guess. No acknowledgment of me standing there. Not sure if i was going to be addressed at all, or if/when i was if it was gonna be with attitude, so i walked out. i was REALLY looking forward to the food too. but there's no reason to be nasty to customers. it's all about tone-you can convey a message with manners and kindness."}
{"text":"So much smoked meat I couldn't finish off my sandwich . Good stuff like pickles, got peppers, and a variety of different salads add to the sandwich experience. You can have the traditional sandwich or Ruben or French dip all with your choice of either smoked meat, pastrami, turkey and more. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches I've had outside of Montreal.  A tasty pile of perfectly smoked beef brisket surrounded by a zesty in-house coleslaw and Russian dressing and put between an awesome pair of rye bread slices. This blows away anything Druxy's puts together.  They serve French's mustard here, the gold standard of mustards. The dill pickle slices were huge, crisp and great-tasting.  I'm hooked and I'll be back to try out some other items.... corned beef? Turkey? Poutine?  I can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"They buy their own corn beef they make nothing on site .I ordered corn beef on rye with caraway seeds they don't have caraway seeds they don't have knish or Kiska. Is not a deli it's a ready-made fast food restaurant which is not very good"}
{"text":"Kids menu for 3.99 is good.  The Montreal smoked meat was okay but a little smaller then I expected for a \"large\".  Philly sandwich is really good with lots of meat.  Worst thing about the place is lack of decent parking.  3-4 people were double parked and many spots are marked for the other stores.  Staff were friendly."}
