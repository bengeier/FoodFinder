{"text":"Had a great meal at Fishbar on Saturday night.  

Three of us went and split the following dishes:

Oysters - 12
Frites
Ceviche
Shrimp Cocktail
Olives
Grilled Calamari
Scallops
Broccoli
Lemon Tart

All of the dishes were pretty perfect.  We were pretty full after the meal, but not overly so, I would probably say about 2-3 dishes per person would be the recommend.  

We also had a great waiter who was attentive and helpful when it came to ordering our food."}
{"text":"Very loud, very busy.

Very very good.

And I like to buy sustainable seafood. Much of theirs is sourced from Hooked, Inc., located at 888 Queen St. East.

I went for a friend's birthday on Sept 24, and the three of us enjoyed ourselves greatly. Seating times were a bit strange: I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance, and was only able to get a 6:45 seating time for a Saturday night. It's a busy place, so book in advance.

First, walking into the place was wonderful. The fresh ocean smell was great, and got us salivating immediately. We were seated promptly, and our waiter came to get our cocktail orders: one octopussy martini, one caesar, one prosecco with (hmm... was it elderberries or wild blueberries? Something that bobbed up and down cheerily on the bubbles in the glass.

We started with the seafood platter, which contained 3 each of two types of oysters (one PEI, one west coast, if I recall); 6 crab claws; 6 shrimp. It was good. The Pacific oysters were quite salty -- I think we preferred the PEI ones. Crab claws were tasty, the shrimp had some flavour (unusual these days -- so many of them just seem to be an excuse for seafood sauce).

Cocktails and appetizers done, we ordered wine: Alvarinho Deu La Deu, recommended by our awesome waiter, who used to work up in Yorkville somewhere. He was impeccable.

From there, we moved on.. we had their ceviche. I'm not sure what the white fish was that was used in it, but it was sweet, tender, delicious. We also had both freshwater and saltwater smelts. The freshwater ones are to die for: a very light crispy batter, hardly there, on small eat-the-whole-thing sweet little fish. To heck with french fries! I want these all the time. The saltwater smelts were larger, had more of that coldwater oil fish taste, like mackerel, but were also delicious.

Next, a Pacific sardine. I filleted it, and we ate. Similar to the saltwater smelt, but much larger -- I'd say it was about 8\" long. Fresh and delicious, cooked perfectly so it could be removed from the bone and yet was still juicy and tender.

The fried squid was tender and delicious. Crispy batter gave way to soft tender flesh.  The beer-battered fish and chips were everything the best fish and chips should be, with moist haddock in a batter shell and Belgian-style frites. The diver bay scallops were sweet and carmelized perfectly, juicy and tender, and served on humita, which complemented them perfectly. And the other dish I have forgotten: it was good, too. We went through 10 dishes, and we'll be back. Maybe on a weekday when it won't be as noisy: hard surfaces and a long narrow space had the sound bouncing around.

We passed on dessert: it was quite full and loud by this time, and we went over to Soma and got some ridiculous ice cream and sorbet to eat for dessert."}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared fish.  Had an amazing experience time.  Well worth the money, if my pocket book could handle it I would be a regular. Cocktails were also amazing. It was a great date."}
{"text":"Slow service! My friends and I walked by Fishbar on a Sunday evening and on the menu posted in the doorway saw that they had an all day oyster happy hour special, which led us to decide on Fishbar for dinner. Turns out the menu we were looking at was an old one because the oyster happy hour special was suppose to have now ended at 5pm but they honoured it which was nice. However, it took them over an hour to shuck our 3 dozen oysters! Considering there was no cooking involved, how does it take that long??? Especially when the restaurant is less than half full! And if you offer an oyster happy hour, you should have someone there who can shuck oysters a lot faster than that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!  Having a seafood Tapas restaurant is a great idea!  The service was excellent.  We had the Calamari (awesome, love that it wasn't breaded) it was cooked perfectly,  mussels (super), Octopus (was the favorite), Lobster Rolls (a very close 2nd favorite) and fried clams (least favorite but still packed with flavour).  They still need to work on the drinks, I had the cucumber martini and felt it was way too sour for what that should taste like.  Great food, great ambiance, simply awesome night out that we are still talking about!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was friendly and on top of their game, the atmosphere the evening we were there was quiet and welcoming, the ambiance is inviting.

The food was... well... boring.  I love fish, and each dish we had was bordering on boring and tasteless.  We were there for a small bite to eat, and maybe we happened on all the wrong items, but it seemed like the common thread of the evening was subdued flavours.  We all split each tapas like dish:  the fishbar tacos, the sicilian gnocchi, the salmon tartar, and the malpeque oysters.  Across the board, each dish was boring and bland.  And each dish was - meh.

I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was ridiculously slow.  Not attentive and forgetful. We had to wait to be greeted so the server could answer the phone. We ordered 3 items to start.  The seafood platter came first after 40min.  When he came to clear our plate,  he told us that he hadn't ordered the other two items yet.  We asked for extra lemon got it in time for the last two smelts."}
{"text":"I had dinner here (for a birthday celebration) recently on a Sunday evening. I made reservations but didn't need them as the place wasn't full at all - I'm sure they are though Thurs-Sat. 

The menu is tapas-style, meant for sharing. There were some stand-out items, and some ho-hum items:
Stand-outs:
The $1.35 oysters! You can't beat that. And they come with fresh horseradish, which I enjoy. The fish & chips are also very good: they were served to us immediately after coming out of the fryer, and so the batter was very crisp and hot. The portion was just perfect; enough to satisfy but not weigh you down. The fish tacos were also excellent - the filling was a nice ceviche. 

The only item we weren't that pleased with was the grilled calamari. It was quite mushy, not cooked quite right.

The drinks situation could use a bit of improvement:
For drinks I tried the Cucumber Gimlet Martini - the menu advertised it as having cucumber, gin and vermouth, but when it arrived it came in a rocks glass with ice, AND it was sweet! I asked the waiter about it and he said they add simple syrup which wasn't indicated on the menu. I don't really enjoy sweet drinks and was disappointed at the false advertising. The waiter did offer to re-make it, but my husband seemed to enjoy it as is (and so he drank the rest).

Some friends came to join us for a drink after our meal. One of them was driving and wanted a non-alcoholic drink. She asked for an orange juice, but the waiter didn't even register this; he brought her a food menu. She then had to explain that she wanted a non-alcoholic drink, of which he just offered her cranberry juice or tonic water. Not everyone drinks, and it's unfortunate that there weren't more choices for her.

The staff was attentive and courteous without any cloying 'over friendliness'.

I'd definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu. Overall, it's a cute place, with good food and a nice cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of friends a couple of weeks ago.  Atmosphere and service were great.  The food was delicious, grilled octopus is to die for, we ended up ordering a second order, very delicious.  The tuna tartar  was super tasty.  I would definitely go back.  The only reason why I am not giving it 5 starts is I feel it's a bit overpriced for what it really is, drinks in particular."}
{"text":"The service was really good, an enjoyable evening on a Saturday night. It wasn't over crowded. Food was really good. Really enjoyed the lobster macaroni."}
{"text":"We had left several messages for reservation with no response. Decided to go anyway, just assumed way too busy to return calls. They are CLOSED....since June 2015...one star since the answer system states open for business..."}
{"text":"This new kid on the Ossington strip needs a bit of time before I venture back.  Service was very slow and the tables are packed in so close together that it's impossible not to eavedrop on your neighbors conversations.  

Like it's name suggest - you come here for fresh seafood served tapas style with oyster platters, fresh fish served different ways, and a variety of other sea creatures.  
One highlight was the steelehead trout rilette.  My good friend Ben was raging about how amazing it was and definitely wanted to see if it was worth the hype.  It was presented in a small mason jar, topped with clarified butter for you to spread on your crostini.  It was definitely very buttery and creamy and felt very decadent.  It was good!. 

Also we both are savoury types of people so we couldn't resist and ordered the salty white anchovies which was served on sourdough crostinis.  Three of them came out presented very cleanly on a bed fruity gremolata.  They were very fresh and salty while the gremolata provided a good balance of sweetness and the crostini was a perfect crunchy texture.

The calamari was breaded with panko and came out hot and flaky and served with a sriracha aioli which was a nice touch of heat!

I was interested in trying the tuna sashimi as you don't really see sashimi preparation outside of a Japanese restaurant and it was done nicely and clean. 

Finally off the mains on the menu, we had the butter poached scallops.  The portion size was a bit disappointing as only 3 of them were on the plate and they weren't too big.  However the french fries were nice and crunchy and salty which was an important element to us."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.

I really wanted to like this place but found my experience to be underwhelming. It's a small restaurant and when we were there around 9pm on a Sat night. We had to wait about 15 min for a table (2). Not too bad on a happening night. 

We started off with a dozen fresh oysters, came with a few sauces, strangely enough no vinegerette though. Half from the west and the other from east coast. I found them to be just okay, not a super great selection. 

Next was the salmon tartare, supposedly wild sockeye salmon and very asian inspired but found the soy sauce overpowering and can't taste any of the fish.

Savings graces were the fried foods, crispy calamari which I thought was one of the best in the city, thick cuts and battered well. The Fish & Chips were a standout to with flaky white haddock.

No dessert and a bottle of white wine (their wine list is a bit depressing and overpriced) came out to be pretty pricey in comparison to other top restaurants in the city. I didn't find a lot of value or our money well spent. I really tried to like this place but found it very hard to do so."}
{"text":"LONGEST WAIT. We arrived at 7.45, took 30 minutes to get a drink, took 30 minutes more to get a few (very small) oysters, then took another 30-45 minutes to get our tapas style mains. My margarita was the tartest margarita I've ever drunk, wayyy too much lime. My lobster mac and cheese was worse than kraft: although I think the cheese sauce was just truffle oil.. so maybe that's why it cost $17?! Only a couple pieces of lobster on top. My friend could only eat a couple of bites of her mac and cheese. It took forever for everyones food to come out of the kitchen, we understand that food can come out at different times esp. as it's \"tapas style\", but this was ridiculous. Also tapas style... who offers fish and chips and mac and cheese as tapas? Had to walk up to the bar to get more water. Passive aggressive waitress, very awkward... honestly the worst service I've had in Toronto. I have to say that this was the first time in..... well ever, that I haven't tipped. The manager was the only good thing about this place... took a while for him to come over, but he offered free desserts (which we declined, we'd already been there for over 3 hours) and drinks. My friends were still hungry post meal, so they went across the road for burgers!"}
{"text":"There are things I love about Fishbar, and things I also really, really don't love.

To love: 
Atmosphere (great neighbourhood, buzzy busy-ness, boozey lighting) AND Fried Ocean Smelts (tasty and worth the bucks)

Not to Love So Much: 
The Seafood \"Platter\". This is a rip-off. At $22, the description gives you the feeling that you'll be getting at least a decent amount of food, but what you really get are 3 each of shrimp, mini crab claws, and oysters. Interestingly, they chose to fill all the empty space with the tops of oysters (more tops than actual oysters). Perhaps consider re-naming this the Seafood Taster? Sampler? Nibblies?

Reservations are definitely recommended for this place - and while food and the flavours are a bit underwhelming considering the price, nice to see a joint serving up some sustainable seafood options."}
{"text":"Wandered in here after beverages in a park with an amigo. We had oysters, tuna crudo, crab cakes and lobster mac and cheese. My eyes rolled in my head in pure joy. It's pretty hard for me not to be satisfied with seafood and I appreciate more so from the time I have cooked it too long in my own house. The tuna crudo in particular was so fresh and delightful. We had the lovely young woman behind the bar pick our wine(s) since I pick based on label picture. No, not an oenophile. Lingered over a whiskey - it wasn't packed when we were there being in between lunch/dinner typical times but the staff were so easy going it felt comfortable to linger and not slam back our food/drinks. 

High fives."}
{"text":"Took twenty minutes just to get our drinks and the seating layout was terrible so squished in your pretty much in strangers conversations and smelling their perfume..Worst Caesar ever by the way. Asked for bill after appetizer came couldn't take it anymore hour of my life I'll never get back"}
{"text":"They lie in their website about the happy hour menu on Sunday. It is NOT all day Sunday and only two kinds of oysters were for happy hour price. The rest of the dishes which showed on their website as happy hour price were not honoured when we went there. 

Two of the waiters said that they did not know what their website is showing. Is that a legitimate excuse? My friend and I felt like being cheated and will never ever go again.

Food was just ok and the portion was small, that made the dishes expensive without making you notice. Tables were jammed with 1 inch of space in between, it's like you were having a meal with the table next to you. It was very loud and noisy, couldn't have a real conversation."}
{"text":"Our first experience at this Ossington tapas bar will sadly be our last. While some menu items impressed; cured salmon, confit tuna, and tuna tartare: the fish and chips were soggy, the fish tacos bland, and the service atrocious. 
As an individual who works in the service industry I can recognize when someone is being stretched too thin, or just isn't meant for the role. Exceptionally long waits to order and to receive our food and drinks. The server was disorganized and downright impolite. With all the amazing restaurants Toronto has to offer, why would anyone eat here?

As servers, bartenders and restaurant managers we were the most disappointed with the level of conflict resolution from both the server and manager. After inquiring about the gratuity added to our bill after such a poor experience, our server retorted with \"Thank you for pointing out that I'm working alone\" followed by an emphatic 'display' of frustration..... \" I'm sorry that you hate me, but what can you do I guess\".  This is not an appropriate course of action if fishbar wants to establish returning clientele."}
{"text":"We did a walk down the Oss stretch and narrowed down our night of dining to Libretto and Fishbar.  It was a tough choice but when we found out it was an hour wait for Libretto it was an easy decision.

The staff are really friendly and sat is quickly.  We had a good look through the menu and decided to get sashimi, grilled octopus, scallops, fried smelt and fries.  Everything sounded amazing and that's were amazing stopped.

We were started with the sashimi and it wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't the best sashimi I've had but it wasn't bad.

The fried smelts came...but I wish they were in the fryer just slightly longer as they were almost golden crispy but not there.  They were still my favourite seafood dish as I love fried smelts, especially when they are golden brown or just crispy.

The scallops on corn was absolutely fantastic, wait actually it was just the corn.  I'm not sure what was in it but it was damn good.  The scallops were good but the corn was that much better and really took over the dish as the scallops were slightly overcooked.

The octopus really deflated this review.  There was no flavour to the octopus except for whatever the grill tasted like.  It was not a nice flavour is all I can say.

Unfortunately for us, the items we ordered on the menu ranged from bad to great.  The second unfortunate thing was the item that was great, wasn't something the restaurant should be good at and that is seafood!  The corn overshadowed the whole meal which sucks as I do love seafood.  

I'll probably give this place one more try but at the rate they charge it's hard to keep trying until you find great items...shouldn't every item be great for the price range the restaurant has set for itself?"}
{"text":"You must have a reservation to eat here, but the incredibly rude, condescending and incompetent staff here may not tell you that until you've been waiting for half an hour after which time you may find yourself being chastised by a snotty-bags-nasty-pants little woman who behaves as if visitors to her restaurant are a bother, not an opportunity. The menu looked superb. Sadly the chef is laboring for dolts. A better bet is a cute little spot called NUIT Queen W. Friendly, delicious, great atmosphere. So skip this Fishbar-sad-excuse-for-hospitality establishment and go have a good time elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great ambience, amazing food and wonderful service.   This tapas style fish bar provides  an excellent selection of shellfish and fish.     My favorite dish was  the cerviche fish tacos which had the great mix of freshness and crunch.    I also enjoyed the baja diver scallops which were cooked perfectly and had an amazing sear.   I will definitely have to come back again for more."}
{"text":"Fishbar is wunderbar!  Hands down one of my favorite seafood restaurants in the city.

Greeted by friendly smiles, we were seated at the bar while we waited for a table by the window to open up.

The drink menu didn't disappoint.
* Shrimp Cocktail Caesar - Perfectly spicy with a gigantic shrimp.
* Octopussy - Hah, clever.  Oysters and vodka... can't go wrong. =)

We ordered a few items:
* Oysters..of course!
The variable oyster menu is written on a chalkboard at the front.  
About $3 bucks a pop.
I don't think I'll ever step foot into Rodney's again.
Great selection of Canadian oysters.  We got a mixed platter of oyster goodness.

* Grilled Calamari ($9)
With a yummy tomato paste, capers and lemon.
Delicious! The calamari was so fresh and a bit chewy but springy.
Probably some of the best calamari I've had.

* Pei mussels ($8)
Bits of chorizo, smothered in fresh tomato sauce.
Piping hot and not too heavy.

I wanted the lemon tart for dessert....but they were sold out.  =(
As an alternative, I had the strawberry shortcake with white chocolate mousse and strawberry mint salsa ($8).
If you like your shortcake light and fluffy...this one isn't.  
It's much more dense with the biscuit and it's a heavier mouse.  

It's a romantic venue with fantastic seafood!
The service was great and I had such a nice time here!
I heart Fishbar! =)"}
{"text":"Food here is always amazing.  Don't think I've had anything I didnt like.  Im a seafood-aholic though so that helps.  Im huge fan of tapas and tried most in the neighbourhood, and this one is on the top of my list of favs. Reasonably priced.  I've occasionally had amazing service here and like the vibe.  Definitely recommend checking out."}
{"text":"Fishbar was on one of my bookmarks-to-try so I was very excited when my bf suggested going there with two other friends. Reservations were easily made on Opentable and when we were running 15 minutes late behind, we called and they had no problem holding our table.

When I read other reviews, my benchmark was already set very low. I was imagining a small, cramped space where I wouldn't be able to hear anything because it was so loud and food that was good...or bad...depending on who reviewed it. In other words, reviews weren't consistent, but I still wanted to try the place out.

8:45pm and the place was packed, but the ambiance was nice. Long and narrow and we were seated by the wall. Our waiter apologized for keeping us waiting but we didn't mind. We started out with a dozen oysters which were excellent. Then, our table shared:

Fish Tacos - Not what I was envisioning. Cold cuts of seafood in a hard, taco shell. Nothing special
Sardines - Ick! I couldn't take one more bite...I don't think it was how they cooked it, but the fish itself
Tuna Tartare - This dish came with a crunchy chip, but I ended up eating the whole dish myself because no one wanted it...nothing special
Fried Calamari - Can never go wrong with fried rings.
French Fries - By far the best dish! We loved it so much we ordered two more
Grilled Spicy Shrimp - WOOT! It definitely is spicy

I had two glasses of white wine and the table share a bottle of sake. Total damage for shrimp and French fries came out to be $230 which is not cheap. Portions are meant for sharing. 

Overall, I am glad I experienced it, but nothing special. The food was good, but its shrimp...its fries...it's a taco. I mean, I can't rave about how fresh a taco is...The fact that its sustainable means I can eat with a guiltless conscious, so a star there. Our server was great - no complaints there. As for the noise level, it was okay with my friends...I didn't need to shout and the space was not cramped. In that regard, another star.

I would love to come back for Happy Hour, especially now because when you check in, you can get a deal on oysters. Nice place to drop by for drinks and nibbles, but I can't see myself coming back here soon for a serious and mean seafood dinner."}
{"text":"Very average seafood establishment.  Maybe I'm just used to the real deal East Coast stuff in a past life but I wasn't terribly impressed with the food.  The food is not terrible but just not great.  The fish & chips were small and the fried pieces had too much batter.  I can easily think of several places in the city that does Fish n' Chips much better.  The maple glazed salmon is something I could easily make at home.  The Brussels on the side were decent but nothing mind blowing.  The fish taco was alright.  It had a bunch of stuff in it so that the fish was not the centerpiece of the flavor.  I didn't order any of the $1.35 oysters, which might of helped the experience, assuming they were fresh and tasty. 

Overall, I found this place very average at best compared to other seafood spots I've tried in many other cities.  But in all fairness, it is hard to pull off great seafood in TO given it's landlocked nature. Fishbar does fill a good niche on the Ossington Strip."}
{"text":"I visited Fishbar as part of their Tweetup with some local Twitter foodies.  Met some great people and ate some great food.  Go to fishbar and try something new.

Seafood with a conscience?  I know this sounds like a contradiction in a world where global economy continually pushes natural resources to the brink in the pursuit of profit.  However, some groups do not subscribe to this unsustainable strategy and opt to pursue a path less traveled.  Though not blazing trails per se, Fishbar at Ossignton and Dundas offers up an almost complete Oceanwise menu.

What does it mean to have an Oceanwise menu?  Well, it means that the seafood offered at the restaurant are all sourced from sustainable providers.  To put it simply, we are not driving the seafood to extinction.  Yes, you can have a great meal and not destroy the fish population.  This is what makes Fishbar special.  They care enough to offer quality seafood that will still be around for our future generations.  

Oceanwise is a cool idea, but does that mean that the food is not as tasty?  I would say the food is just fine.  Now don't get me wrong, I have a love affair with the handful of Japanese restaurants serving beautiful fish.  Beautiful fish that you will find on many, endangered and extinct proximity lists.  Beautiful fish, like Bluefin Otoro tuna, which is at the top of the extinction list and my Omakases.  It is just so hard I say, however I promise to attempt to be a better food person.  Just don't quote me.  At Fishbar, supporting sustainability is not a gimmick so you will find great food.        

Fried smelts should replace fries.  Burgers and Smelts anyone?
I spoke to the owner Jaime who ran me down some basics about the concept of Fishbar.  Fried smelts, sashimi mackerel, mussels and oysters with all supporting ingredients obtained within a 100 mile radius.  These are the places we need to support.  Food shortages throughout the world, scientists calling for local sourcing and quality restaurants like Fishbar truly listen and act.  I believe he felt it is the food purveyors duty to educate the masses that sustainable fish like smelts, sardines and anchovies can hold their weight against fish we may never see again.           

Still not convinced?  Fishbar also happens to have Botarga and White Anchovy.  White anchovy that just happened to blow my mind.  This has to be the best dish on the menu.  Citrus, ocean, salt and butter attack your tongue and force you to submit.  White Anchovy makes me feel like I am sitting on the coast of Sicily, bartering with a fisherman that I do not understand.    

Their wild caught Sockeye Salmon was bright red.  Most of us think pink when picturing Salmon then Fishbar just blows me away with this gorgeous red coloured, tartare.  Yes, its red and yes it is Salmon.  So good.

The only thing that would of made the mussels better would be some al dente noodles to sop up the remaining sauce.   

Mackerel sashimi was good and was served with this intensely sour cumquat that paired perfectly

Diver scallops, cooked medium, served with an insane mais, reminiscent of chick peas.  

White anchovy is my mistress
Oysters were fresh, briny and sweet

Their Octopussy or Oyster Martini.    

Calamari was my least favorite dish

Perfectly spiced ceviche."}
{"text":"$17 for few pieces of frozen lobster semi-thawed on low quality spaghetti - not amused. Terrible price to quality ratio, do not recommend."}
{"text":"We went for their happy hour and had some oysters, apps, and drinks.

Beausoleil oysters - a bit nicer than normal, but for $1.75 a piece, a bargain.
Kusshi oysters - Pricey @ $3.50 a piece, but we saved on the Beausoleil's, so that was a perfect justification.  Very good.

Fish taco - Good, but not awesome like many Toronto places.
Fried clams - Very good. Can still taste the flavour of the clams after frying, which is nice.

Wine - The red @ happy hour was very good, and great value.
Beer - Granville Island Hefeweizen is a great beer to have with seafood. If I weren't driving, I'd have had more.

Service: Solid. Nice people.

We'd eat here again if in the mood for seafood/oysters, but there are many other oyster places popping up to try."}
{"text":"So, the atmosphere is lovely. The staff is quite friendly and very accommodating. We had onion rings (very tasty), octopus (delicious), shrimp diablo (very tasty), tuna tartar (it was okay, the yucca chips were chewy), crispy calamari (I would not recommend as they were just okay and for $10 - just okay, does not cut it), fish and chips (fries were delish, fish was not at all), and we had oysters (those were very nice and fresh). 
The wine was expensive for what it was and disappointing. They did not have anything interesting non-alcoholic cocktail options, which is a shame. 

For our bill, which was $140, it was not as good as I had hoped. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool vibe here. However, beware, as the name implies, this is a hard core fish spot, and ALL items are seafood oriented. That being said I'm a seafood lover so I really enjoyed the bites of the dishes at our table. Itis w very intimate setting where all the tables close together and it can be quite dark lighting at night. I love how they open up to side window open on nice days and you can have fresh air and hear the coming and goings on the street."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere! 
The grilled octopus was AMAZING. The tuna tartare, grilled sardines and oysters were tasty too. All seafood was fresh and seasoned perfectly. 
Only downside was how close we had to sit to our neighbouring tables.
I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we came here the day their furnace broke. The place was very cold, not much they could do about it other than apologize for the circumstances. 

We stayed for apps and ordered the battered calamari and fried smelts. The calamari was fresh and tasty, and the fried smelts were decent.

We did not stay for dinner, it was much too cold. We'll try again in the summer."}
{"text":"Am I on another planet or did Fishbar just really screw up on one Saturday night?

Ceviche was just OK. The salmon tartar was terrible - the worst I've had. Very bizarre consistency. The batter on the fried calamari was too much. The fish and chips was the best thing there. Dessert -a peanut butter concoction on top of a spongy sort of cake did not work at all.

It felt like they were trying to add flair to the food yet hadn't mastered the basics. Its a cute space and it was very busy but if you are a foodie, you won't return here."}
{"text":"Came here because All Saints next door was too busy. We chose this place because we were craving oysters and they did not disappoint! 

For $1.50 an oyster, they were fresh. We also ordered fish and chips, lobster mac and cheese, fried clams, and bloody Caesars.

Fish and chips : good portions, nice crispy batter, moist fish.
Lobster Mac and cheese: love! Lots of lobster pieces. The flavour pairing of the cheese and lobster were great. I wish there had been more cheese and perhaps make it more saucy. 
Fried clams: these are to die for! Nice small fried clams with phenomenal flavours. The little crunch you  get when you pop them in your mouth will get you addicted. Great to share with friends and a round of beer. 

Overall: The food was great, atmosphere was hipster-y but playful, service is amazing, and the price was affordable. Would definitely come again. :)"}
{"text":"Fishbar is an interesting concept, but ultimately it failed to provide a really satisfying dining experience.  Overall I found the food to be somewhat bland and incredibly overpriced.  

I did appreciate the fact that they're fish come from sustainable sources and while I don't mind paying a bit more for that, you really need to provide some \"zing\" at these prices.

Meh!"}
{"text":"Aside from pork, fish and seafood is front and centre in Chinese cuisine.  Just go to a Chinese wedding and you will feast on an abundance of abalone, lobster and steamed fish, granted the selection is not always pro-sustainability.  We're also very particular about our seafood.  After having dined on many a seafood dish at a bounty of restaurants a few years ago that were overcooked to the point where the albumin rears its ugly head - I had taken an oath to veer away from seafood and stick with my steak frites and duck confit.

But when Fishbar first opened its doors and having read many rave reviews about it, I decided to give it a try.  To make my experiment much more fruitful was the fact that the restaurant is Ocean Wise certified which means that you're supporting sustainable fishing. 

Being a food blogger, it takes awhile for me to circle back to tried-and-true favourites because shiny and new restaurant reviews always get lots of eyeballs.  I had been meaning to revisit Fishbar after having seen tweets about B.Y.O.W Wednesdays, where for a $2 minimum donation to Ocean Wise you can bring your own wine.  But considering that corking fees start at $20, I encourage you all to give generously.

When my foodie friends over at View the Vibe invited me to preview the new Spring/Summer menu and to celebrate the 2 year anniversary of Fishbar - I just couldn't resist.

While the fried smelts and lobster mac 'n cheese (temporarily retired from the menu) didn't make an appearance, I was introduced to some new favourites.

Owners William Tavares and Renata Andreazza were great hosts and provided explanations of each of the dishes we sampled.  In addition to the delicious seafood samplings we sampled a stiff Octopussy Martini (eating the vodka-soaked oyster is not optional), and a few great wines.

Before sitting down to dinner we noshed on a selection of Malpeques and Village Bay oysters.

Some of the highlights of the night for me were:

White Anchovy crostini with caramelized onions, olive & lemon gremolata ($10) - This was a well-balanced trio of salty, sweet and citrus; loved noshing on these while sipping on a glass of Portuguese 2011 Deu La Deu Alvarinho Vinho Verde.

Tuna Sashimi with mango soy glaze, toasted almond, mango and seasame salad ($14) - The vibrant colours of this fruit leather-esque dish was only a teaser to its taste.  A light, refreshing dish that would be perfect in the summer.  It's great to see sashimi presented differently than your usual Japanese restaurant fare.

Spiced Lentil Salad with lobster crème fraîche, micro greens and crispy papadum.  This was definitely the most unique dish and texturally impressive.  Large chunks of lobster, soft lentils and crispy papdum (Indian origin, and are traditionally made with lentils, black gram, chickpeas and rice flour).

Pacific Salmon Tartare with pickled ginger & cucumber, tempura white onions, basil aioli ($13) - Yes, another raw fish dish.  What can I say?  When the fish is fresh, this is the best way to eat it?  While the tempura-battered onions were a tad oily, the tartare really brightened the palate.

Baja Diver Scallops with apple butter, Pancetta crisp ($18) - The biggest scallops I've ever seen, perfectly browned with Pancetta instead of your usual boring bacon, fatty pork belly and some apple butter to cut the richness and salt.  Yummy!

Grilled Maple Miso glazed Salmon with asparagus tips & sweet pea butter sauce ($16) - Perfectly tender and flaky salmon with a nice sweet glaze made this dish a hit.  Nothing worse than eating a maple Miso glazed salmon that is drowning in syrup.  This one was just right.

Sicilian Gnocchi with Spot prawns, shitake mushrooms, arugula, white wine, garlic ($16) - Not your average gnocchi!  This had the mouth-feel of a Korean rice cake and was less starchy, but I totally loved it!

We also sampled a dessert trio consisting of a gelato, deconstructed Tiramisu (with whole coffee beans tossed in sugar - amazing!) and my favourite, Lemon Curd Parfait ($9).   All this with a glass of Quinta Serra d'Ordens White Porto, which was not too sweet and just right.

A special thanks to View the Vibe and Fishbar for having me.  I will most definitely have to come back for the Fishbar Taco (halibut & shrimp ceviche, guacamole, birds eye chili, corn tortilla), a customer favourite.

{"text":"The time we spent last Friday evening at Fishbar was a toda madre!!! Awesome...

I could feel the smoothness of the summer breeze inside the restaurant (the place is open in the in front, and for the first table gives the impression of been hanging out on an European terrace...People walking thru, would stop to ask us if the food was good, and while chewing with guilty-pleasure faces, we would just made positive signs with our  thumbs). 

The quality, flavor, consistency and presentation of the food was impeccable. They gave time for enjoying each curse without been pushy.  The service was fast, extremely friendly, and attentive without been around too much (they give space to the couples that were the main concurrence... just a dude was sitting in the bar, but maybe he worked there...)

Because the ambiance is chilled-relaxed-romantic, this place could be use or it's been used for couples to enjoy flirty moments, after all, we all know what the oysters and seafood are famous for, right?? wink, blink!! So guys, this do is a special date spot to pamper girls, or for setting the mood for the night...

We ordered 3 different kind of oysters (the Shigoku from BC were choby, firm, similar to those plane shelled gallego oysters). They came with horseradish, and 3 really original and cool toppings:  red salsa (spicy home made), echalote wine vinaigrette (a lil too sour), and the winner, vodka with chilies (Mateo made vodka oyster cocktails with it instead... ay Mateo...).

The smelts were really meaty, crunchy, and I think they are the perfect summer guilty free tapa... omega3, olive oil, and healthy stuff... Apparently, if you want to captivate a Portuguese guy, this are a must along with Sardines (Mateo's eyes were orbit outed, he was smiling while watching them, and he was rubbing his hands).

The grilled octopus and the tuna tartar came afterwards...OMG!!! I was feeling the love in every bite, not only for the chef who executed such delicatessens , but also for this amazing husband, who invited me here to celebrate his new job!!! Speaking about that octopus....  There are places in this city that serve it under cook, chewy-not swallowing style, or over cooked, like disintegrating-watery in your tongue, but this joint served it al dente, crunchy but smooth, and those veggies who accompanied it were succulent as well. The tartar came with a guacamole and crispy plantain or something... it was buttery, creamy, exquisite..

Everything was accompanied by a bottle of perfectly chilled Alvarinho."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, with the same group.  Such an ideal spot for pre-Ossington theatre dinner.  The first time, we loved the food, the wine list, the service, etc....but we were in a bit of a rush.  We knew we were on to something, so we re-booked for an evening where we didn't have to rush.  
The wine menu is good, well-priced and lots of selection (or maybe its just stocked with my favourites).  We ordered a bottle and settled in to look at the menu.  So many choices!  We tried to have items that we didn't have the first time - we loved every item from the first time, but wanted to explore beyond.  Our server, Monica, was such fun and made great recommendations for us.  However, I really feel that you couldn't go wrong with much on the menu.  There were a few stand out items for us - gnocchi, seaweed salad, oysters, tartar, arugula salad.   I'll definitely be back - would also love to bring the hubby and kids."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly, fast, attentive. Nice location. The oysters that weren't spoiled were decent. It was only 1/12 but there really shouldn't be any spoiled oysters served. Other dishes ordered were ok."}
{"text":"There's something fishy about the Fishbar, but that's an awesome thing. After reading the great reviews about this place here on Yelp, my two dining companions and I went there for my birthday last week; happily, Fishbar definitely did not disappoint. 

Out of all the dishes we ordered, the ceviche and salmon tartare were the biggest standouts. The salmon was delicious: mild and so so fresh, mixed with teensy sweet apple pieces. The ceviche was refreshing and zingy, and perfect with the accompanying fried sweet potato \"matchsticks.\" The pan seared arctic char shouldn't be missed, either -- cooked perfectly, totally tender and moist. I also really dug the shrimp cocktail Caesar, which was nicely spicy and perfect with the giant shrimp attached. 

The one detractor about the experience is that this restaurant gets loud when it's crowded. It was hard for me to hear my table-mates and be heard. It was especially difficult for my mother who is, shall we say, a little bit \"older\", and her hearing is not as good as it once was. 

Despite the noise, the experience at Fishbar was overall very positive. I love the fact that most of the seafood on the menu is certified sustainably caught, plus the service was stellar. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Oysters and fresh cut fries with miso aoli were very good but portion size of the fries was quite small. Mahi mahi tacos were good but no flavours stood out.  The mussels with tomato and chorizo were served luke warm, the tomatoes canned (not premium) and barely cooked. There was no discernible trace of chorizo. Overall found food to be not vibrant with a lack of value for money."}
{"text":"If you like seafood at all, get yourself to Fishbar. They are constantly shucking several different types of oysters, the sashimi is fresh and tender, and the fried calamari is the best you'll ever taste!

We have met the oyster shucker (from Rodney's) and the sommelier and they are both friendly and professional. The wine list is varied and reasonably priced. The food is so good I want to go back tonight and try more dishes. Don't leave without trying a dessert either! We had a rhubarb and shortbread dessert last night that was so good I wanted to lick the bowl. I didn't. I swear.

If you love fish and know someone who doesn't, take them anyway. They have steak and veggies and fries on the menu for your friends. But you? Try the sashimi! And don't feel bad about eating this fish. They are very serious about purchasing sustainable, ocean wise seafood and have labelled the dishes accordingly.

They've only been open a few weeks for dinner, but eventually they will open for lunch too. Enjoy,"}
{"text":"Liked the ambience, servers were great, food wasn't bad- you can't go wrong with oysters. Reminds me of Rodney's oyster bar in Vancouver (never been to the one in Toronto but I'm sure it's similar). Calamari is not the light batter but the heavier onion ring like batter....overall, it wasn't spectacular but good."}
{"text":"Deeee-Lish!!  Food was outstanding, from portions to flavor to cost. We ate a wide range of their menu but my favorites were: the octopus ceviche, scallops, shrimp, lobster mac 'n cheese and the frise salad. For dessert we shared the lavender honey creme brule - never had one quite like this before.

Atmosphere was also lovely. The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable, from the moment I called for a reservation.

Fishbar is topping our top 10 list of favorites restaurants in Toronto and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night after reading as much as I could about the place.  We happened to be sitting next to an elder couple who were returning to the restaurant to celebrate their husband's release from the hospital.  The first time was prior to him being admitted, and they happened to sit next to the reviewer from the Globe & Mail.  Apparently they had gushed to him about the food, and of course the review turned out very favourably.  Well, either the walls have ears or somehow someone at the restaurant found out about this good deed, and they were getting comp'ed all sorts of dishes, not to mention a special visit by the manager.

We ordered the Steelhead Trout Rillette, White Anchovy (too salty for my likes), Codfish Brandade, Salmon Tartare (bright red salmon), PEI Mussels w/ Spanish Chorizo (standout dish, particularly because of the chorizo), Beer Battered Fish & Chips, 6 Oysters (3 East Coast & 3 West Coast), Crispy Calamari and a bottle of the Gruner Veltliner '10 ($40 bottle that is refreshing and pairs very well with the seafood).  The highlights of our meal were the oysters (the East Coast ones were definitely better than the West), the PEI Mussels with the chorizo and the Veltliner (white wine).

Overall, somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm feeling generous so I will round up."}
{"text":"Long, narrow space with a chic vibe...friendly if slow service...and the bench seating against the wall could definitely be more comfortable (back pillows perhaps?)

Oysters were pretty fresh, fried lake smelts (with sea salt and lemon) were very tasty (for $7 you get a nice amount, almost too many for us), crispy calamari was super battery and crispy as promised, and seared crusted sesame tuna was a lovely dish--recommended. But the definite highlight was the Fishbar Taco (halibut/shrimp ceviche with guac and chili).

Worth a go!"}
{"text":"Good: Almost all the seafood is sustainable, so you can enjoy a great meal without feeling guilty about callously depleting the world's oceans. The ambiance is very Ossington: Loud and lively.  

Better: Fried lake smelts! Lightly breaded and fried, these crispy delights are eaten whole. Normally I don't like it when my meal is eyeballing me, so I devoured them head first. Much more interesting than french fries. 

The lobster mac and cheese was decadent, with just the right amount of truffle oil. The oysters were so tasty that we ordered seconds, and enjoyed them with lemon and fresh horseradish. 

Best: The octopus ceviche was out of this world! It was fresh and the consistency was perfectly chewy - nothing slimy or rubbery about this cephalopod. Loved the addition of creamy avocado. 

Overall, the best seafood meal I've had in Toronto. Will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu.

This is actually a 4.5 star review; my only complaints were the mediocre dessert (lemon curd parfait) and that our vegetable sides were served after the rest of the meal. 

Funds: $160 for 12 oysters, three seafood dishes, two vegetables, two drinks, dessert and a hefty (well-deserved) tip. Not sure what it entails, but they have a weekend happy hour starting at 3:30... sounds tempting!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe.  

The service was great! Our waiter was attentive, despite the restaurant being so busy.   

My favorite dish was the lobster poutine.  It was just as good as the lobster mac and cheese they offered in the winter.  Everything was well seasoned, beautifully presented and the quality of the fish and seafood was excellent!  Another table favourite were the tacos and the whole fish.  

Of our group of 5, only 2 of us had been there before.  The other 3 agreed that they would definitely be back for more.

The whole group also felt that the food was very reasonably priced.

I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends tonight and shared about 8 dishes. Most were pretty good. The fish tacos were excellent. Ceviche style with a hard corn shell. The oysters were tasty but a bit on the small side. The highlight was probably the Shrimp and Lobster Roll. Service was spot on. All in all some good eats. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's not a happy birthday for me until I get to stuff my gullet with seafood so we decide to check out Fishbar for dinner since it was a carry over from my 2012 to-try list.

Reservations were made easily online but I have to mention - their website was a hot mess.  The menu was very difficult to read.  I just checked back and looks like they are working on improving it.

Our group of 4 arrived around 7pm to an empty restaurant - oh goodie, a private dinner.

Started with a round of drinks, a bottle of riesling,  a dozen PEI oysters on the half shell ($2.50 each) and the smelts ($8).  

We also ordered a variety of tapas from the menu to share - tuna tartar ($16), fish tacos - 2 per order ($12), anchovies on crostini ($8), scallops with apple butter ($16), seared tuna ($16) and fries ($6).

The highlight of the meal was definitely the tuna tartar and the fish tacos.  Both tasted super fresh and amazing.  We actually had to get a second round of both!

Low light was the smelts.  I'm from Northern Ontario so I know how easy it is to catch and prepare smelts...it was a staple in my childhood diet right along with Labatt 50 and maple syrup.  The Fishbar smelts were super fishy tasting which signals to me that they were probably frozen and not fresh.  They were soggy and flaccid (deep fryer not hot enough?).  I've definitely had better at highway truck stops.  

Service was adequate and I was comforted when a few more diners showed up about half way through our meal.  

Fishbar was definitely a treat since I couldn't very well go fishing for my own seafood at this moment.  Would consider returning next time my fancy turns to fish."}
{"text":"Seafood is extremely fresh but portions are ridiculously small.
Recommend:
the hard shell Tacos
Fried Calamari.

Oysters were alright."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Friday/Saturday/Sunday from 3:30 - 5:30!

House Beer 15oz for $4 which is a Steam Whistle! Or if you are like me, prefer a glass of white wine $5.

Oysters from $1.35 each or $16 for a dozen...We opted for the French Kiss which is $1.75 each or $20 for a dozen instead...

There are also other cooked seafood on the menu if you are not into oysters. 

Most items are $1 or $2 less than what they charge on the regular menu, so not really a huge difference in prices.

Fishbar is definitely a good place to have a drink or 2 and chill out a bit in between meals. Since it was a Sunday late afternoon, the restaurant was really quiet with just our table at 5 pm.

Service was ok, we get what we want but did feel a little rush since the staff were prepping for dinner rush.

$4 for a beer is really a good price..... I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood is very hard to find this far from a coast but Fishbar does a good job.  They have a great selection of oysters and have an eclectic range of dishes that range from ceviche, to grilled octopus to lobster mac&cheese.  I list that range because I happen to really like each of them.  Each are well prepared and are clearly sourced from somewhere with high quality, fresh fish.  No its not the East Coast, but it is one of the better seafood options in the city."}
{"text":"Ok, not a bad little fish joint at all. Very chill staff in this small little seafood restaurant on Ossington.  Just about EVERYTHING on the menu sounds really delicious so you just have to pick and choose, unless you have some sort of infinite belly and equally large wallet.

Taste wise, I am slightly disappointed. Everything that was outstanding about Fishbar had little to do with the seafood itself. It was usually the delicious little bits of corn on the scallops, or the amazing sauces that added to the dishes that really stood out, not the dishes themselves. The actually seafood was so so. Slightly undercooked smelts that lacked that crispy goldenbrowness to it, slight overcooked octopus that tasted like rubber and bbq grill, average tasting sashimi, and so on."}
