{"text":"Food about average for Americanized Chinese food. I've picked up takeout there a few times, not because it's so good, but it's close by. I don't give many reviews, but since I have experienced repeated problems, I wanted to let other know. Every time I've visited, the same blond lady has been at the order counter and packs the food. I'm not sure if she's the manager or an employee. Tonight I ordered food at the counter between 6 and 6:30 p.m. After several minutes, just as I could see my food being placed on the shelf by the cook, someone that was a friend of the counter person came in and she came out from around the counter to hug him and then talk to him for several minutes. By the way, the place was about totally empty except for someone finishing up at a table and another person that ordered takeout just after me. Anyway, after talking to the friend for several minutes, she came back to the counter, took a glance that should have seen my food just sitting there, and proceeded to take the friend's order. That took several more minutes as they still had a lot of friendly talk and discussion about the menu. Finally after taking the man's cash and handing him change, she went over (now after 7 minutes) to put covers on my food and put it into the bag. I also noticed that she handled the tops, both outside and inside the covers of the plastic tops for the food without washing her hands after handling cash - I would imagine that is against local food handling regulations. A shame she had no concern for the customer whose food was sitting there so long getting cold so she could talk to her friend. It was not very warm when I arrived at home, about five minutes away.   I have ordered takeout for lunch on about five occasions. Every time the same lady was there taking the orders, putting tops on the food and putting it into bags. They have a lunch special where you get a free egg roll or spring roll with your entree. The first two times I requested the free spring roll, but when I got home the spring roll was missing. On the third visit I had to remind her that she forgot the spring roll. After the third visit I had learned that at this place you have to check to make sure the lady is not shortchanging you. Now I don't think this is on purpose and the lady is very friendly, just not well focused on doing her job properly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my husband and kids.  1st time eating here.  I had the amazing Chicken Curry (yellow curry) w/veggies & brown rice (and a spring roll too).  Flavors were perfect - not too hot & not too sweet - veggies were very fresh & had a good assortment!  Chicken was super tender and flavorful!  My husband had the Happy Family lunch - very fresh as well & shrimp were fresh (and deveined as well).  Kids had teriyaki chicken and rice.  Kids said it was really good & \"better than Panda Express\" (that's a compliment coming from my picky kids!) We will definitely be coming back to try the noodles & soups!   Very clean restaurant & restrooms too.   Staff super friendly & knowledgeable about the menu.  Great service & great food!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Thai/Asian/Japanese place in Charlotte. My son and I decided to take a ride across town. What a surprise! I had the Thai Curry noodles with chicken which was absolutely fantastic. Large portion, cooked perfectly. Thai curry sauce had the perfect flavor and the chicken was very tender. The noodles were fresh and looked like they were freshly made.  My son had the vegetarian noodle stir fry. They used a 5 spice tofu that he went crazy over. Pricing is very reasonable and they have beer and wine available. We will be back again. Don't think twice about Hao Chee. And by the way, The guy that said they used frozen veg must have been smoking crack. This is the real deal!!! You could thank me later.."}
{"text":"The service was great! The woman at the cashier seemed genuinely happy to help. The food was very good and they have a great selection. I got a stir fry while my friend got a bento box. We were both very pleased with our food. The prices are very reasonable, especially for the amount of food received. I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Hao Chee over the weekend with my friend, ordered Thai curry, it was delicious ! Very nice ambiance, good quantity and excellent quality.  I would recommend this restaurant for TO-GO, but dine-in also very nice experience."}
{"text":"I was glad to hear of a new restaurant in the area...but...after stopping in for lunch today...I'm sure it wont be there long.   I ordered the Sesame Chicken special - unfortunately the rice was \"very\" dry (like oatmeal) and the chicken had that \"hint of freezer\" taste to it.  I could also tell from the broccoli (small - dark) definitely from frozen.  So much for the \"Fresh\" in the name. My wife ordered the Sushi Bowl.  Looked to be a good portion - presented nicely, until you get just past the top and see most of the bowl is filled with rice with what looked like a block of rice in the bottom area. Over all - the taste was lacking, the rice was dry, not worth your time or money.  If Hao Chee \"Fresh\" Cafe keeps on this path it wont take long. Took a couple pics..."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the service is great. We found this place as the restaurant near here that was closed and we are glad we found this place. It's our new favorite restaurant in Matthews and we will come here often. We order the stir fry bar and it's amazing. We also order the Hao Chee roll which is fabulous. We will continue to come here and try something different."}
{"text":"Yikes. That was white meat chicken? It was gummy rubbery something. Flavor meh. Husband wouldn't even eat it. Not sure how people like this."}
{"text":"Excellent new Chinese spot near the Siskey YMCA."}
{"text":"We stopped by Hao Chee for a late lunch/early dinner one Sunday while stopping by the shopping plaza to get groceries at Publix.  Sadly, though, we had just missed the lunch cut-off and had to pay dinner prices (which weren't all that much more, but cheaper is always better!).    Everyone was very friendly and the menu offered a lot of variety at very reasonable prices.  They offer not only traditional Asian dishes, but Bento boxes, wrap sandwiches, and fried sushi rolls, etc.  You order at the counter and then sit down, so it was a challenge for me to pick something out so quickly when so many things sounded good.   The dining room was bigger than I expected, but the majority of the seating is behind a wall, so you're not close to the windows/sunshine. :(   Everything was very clean, though.    I ended up getting a Bento box which, if you've never had one, is pretty much like a sampler platter.  I tried the spring roll, Hao Chee Fried Roll, and Bang Bang Shrimp with brown rice.  All tasted fresh and delicious.  The sushi roll was so flavorful, and the shrimp in the Bang Bang Shrimp were so much bigger than I was expecting.    I really enjoyed my first experience at Hao Chee, and it will definitely be our go-to place when we need a quick, delicious bite before shopping for groceries at Publix."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a pick-up. Unfortunately, the food was bad even at the Americanized Chinese food level, let alone authentic Chinese food. I went there at 12:15pm so around lunch time on a weekday and there was absolutely nobody eating there. I am rating them on food quality alone. The cashier was pleasant. But the food was not tasty at all."}
{"text":"So glad I noticed this place on the way to Publix.  The food is wholesome and savory.  My spicy shrimp were the best consistency ever, you know, that crunch snap of first bite but then just melts in your mouth.  As a first timer,  I wasn't sure what to order.  So I asked another customer, who reported he had just discovered this place and eaten there 3x in past 2 days.  I copied his order of spicy shrimp and stir fry chicken.  A lot of leftovers to look forward to.  I can't wait tip its gone so I can go back!  I also got the seaweed salad which I am now to full to try.  It looks and smells amazing.  yummerz."}
{"text":"I had the seafood toss and turn. The menu says it's something you'll have to try and I did. I liked the large shrimp and crab and vegetables. The sauce was so-so for me but not bad, portion was huge. Next time I want to try the bento box or one of the entree meals. My fiance got the bento box and I sampled from his (with permission) - delicious! We went with one of our friends as well and the three of us could barely finish our meals - so filling! The interior was clean and the employee at the front was sweet and informative. We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem one evening with my boyfriend and we were pleasantly surprised. We were greeted with smiles and friendly service, and a clean environment. We ordered the edamame and pot stickers for an appetizer which were both delicious! My boyfriend had the Curry Chicken which he thoroughly enjoyed. I had the yummy Teriyaki Chicken! We each enjoyed an egg roll on the side that were delicious! The only down fall was the booths are a bit tight, I recommend sitting at a table. Overall, very pleased!"}
{"text":"It had been over a year since we were here last  The menu had changed from a simple easy to choose to a more extensive and more expensive selection.  When our group of 8 went in, at 6pm, there were no other diners. A worker was mopping the floor of the restaurant with a very strong bleach solution that was very overwhelming.  After looking over the menu , we decided that the smell was unappetizing and we left."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when seeing burritos on an asian menu.  I tried the chicken stir fry and it was a descent portion but the rice was very bland and the dish lacked some flavor. Duck sauce helped and they leave packets out for you to take how ever many you want!  They make it clear they don't use msg which is great and although it lacked some flavor, I could tell it was a healthier kind of asian dish.  We will definitely try it again and see what that asian burrito is all about!!  Oh, and the sea weed salad!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this new restaurant, so we were excited to try the food...and we were for the most part not disappointed. My wife and I each had stir fry beef - one with teriyaki sauce - one with Gardo sauce.   While my first impression was \"wow\" everything tastes so fresh\", I must say that the Gardo sauced dish was devoid of flavor. I almost think they forgot the sauce. The Teriyaki sauced dish was a bit light on the flavor as well.  The quality of the beef was excellent however...tender and lean...usually one expects these type dishes to have small pieces of beef that are chewy so this is another reason to love Hao Chee.  The Stir Fry was served with a chug-worthy shrimp sauce and the fried pork potstickers were scrumptious!   Oh one last thing to the management - please fix the mens room sink...the caulking where it meets the wall looks like it was applied with a popsicle stick...please call a pro...the rest of your remodel is flawless. great job!"}
{"text":"I really loved the food here, it was fresh and very flavorful. The portions were pretty descent and the price was reasonable. The chicken teriyaki had a good proportion of veggies and chicken the fried rice was a small portion but it was tasty, the kids enjoyed the spicy flavor of the general tso and the sauce for the rice was just perfect.  I was getting tiered of the heaviness and the... \"I'm not sure this is chicken or pork in my food or I sure hope it's one of them\" from some local Chinese restaurants (I'm not going to name names) it is definitely good to know we can get fresh Asian food nearby ;)"}
{"text":"You can tell when a business wants to be successful. Warm, friendly service is a start, and that's the first thing you experience when you walk through the doors of Hao Chee. The decor is simple and practical with eye appeal. Then there's the food. I've been here three times, and each item has been nothing short of delicious. The wraps should be at the top of your list of things to try, and the sesame chicken might possibly be the best in town. Hopefully Hao Chee remains a staple in Matthews."}
{"text":"Just decided to try it on the fly.  My husband got the chicken wrap & salad (it was made with fried, not grilled, chicken which he was not expecting).  I got the roll and salad.  I forgot to specify I wanted shrimp, so the default was chicken.  The rolls were a good portion, very fresh.  The salad was fresh and green.  They drizzled the roll with yummy sauce and EEL sauce.  The eel sauce ruined it for me. It gave it a very fishy taste.  My husband traded his chicken wrap with me and it was delicious.  Nothing out of the ordinary chicken wrap though.   I am definitely going to try it again -- this time without the eel sauce.  Very resonably priced."}
{"text":"I have been three times, and all three times the food has been excellent, the service has been solid and friendly, and the portions are humongous. Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"I got two stir fry dishes, thai curry and masala. The sauces were excellent and tasty. However, the tofu was rubbery and bland. I would recommend that a fried or stir fried tofu be offered. Additionally, for take out orders the rice should be packaged separately from the stir fry else all the gravy gets soaked up by the rice."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for weeks since I had such a wonderful customer service experience at Hao Chee. Lisa and Stacy were SO friendly and accommodating. While I was waiting for more of the delicious \"yummy sauce\" to be made, they brought me tea and made nice conversation. My whole party ordered different stir fry dishes, and they were very fresh. Most of us agreed they could've used more sauce. The sauce really wasn't noticeable on a couple of the dishes at all. But if we would've asked for extra, they would've gone from good to \"wow!\" The Crazy Chicken Roll didn't do much for us, but it was fun to try something new. Next time I'm in town, I hope to go back for the stir fry (with extra sauce, of course).  :)"}
