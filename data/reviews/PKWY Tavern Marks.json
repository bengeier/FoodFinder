{"text":"Tried to go here last Sunday to watch football. Great TVs and wasn't very crowded (figured out why pretty quick).  Two of the four people in our party are Bud Light drinkers. I know not everyone is a fan, but it is the number one selling beer in America, so you would think you could get it, at least a bottle if not on tap...but NO. So, disappointed everyone started asking for something else that was on the menu. The next 4 beers we requested they were out of. So ended up drinking one beer that didn't really want, and paid $6.75 for a pint. This is not the strip. Any other gaming/sports bar in town would be a couple bucks cheaper. No selection of beer other than heavy craft/specialty beers.  One or two heavy beers is great, but can't sit and watch football games and drink that all day. And way too expensive. Doubt we will return, as convenient as it may be to our part of town."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time Friday night. A friend invited me to an office party. Right from the beginning the place is well lite, clean-very clean, warm, accommodating, great staff. They have an elevator for disabled folks to the second floor. Not smoky like other places. A little waft here and there but nothing to shower over. The crowd seems to be 20s and 30s. The music was at a decent level you just had to talk over the drunk adults.  The staff I cannot say enough about this young staff that bends over backwards for their guests. With a strong manager that us right there doing the work too!! Food review: unless you ask the mixed drinks are a bit watered down. Not sure why. Decently priced beers and shots.  Had the fish n chips. Fish was amazing. For the first time I LIKE tartar sauce and this isn't your plain old sauce either. Fries were meh, kind of soggy, over seasoned. I'd say fry them a bit longer and let the patrons season their own. Appetizers were great overall, just really good updated bar food minus the bloat. Atmosphere is friendly, fun, easy to get comfy.  Again the manager and staff were on point all the time. I will definitely go back here again and again."}
{"text":"Unbelievable, an hour to get water,  30 minutes waiting for 1 beer,  3 if us odered, they brought one person's while the other 2 waited another 30 minutes!  Ordered pretzel bites got a pretzel. Place has such potential,  too bad the service is so horrendous"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, waited 30+ minutes to get our food and the place wasn't even that busy.  The food was mediocre at best and the prices weren't good enough to justify it."}
{"text":"Super slow. I hoped it would change with new management, but it still took 15 minutes to get my first drinks ordered. I say \"drinks\" because I order two at a time, or else I'll go 20-30 minutes between drinks. It can be quicker at the bar, but it depends on how busy they are and who's bar-tending."}
{"text":"Tight machines and warm beer (both bottles and draft).   I understand these places are about making money, but if I'm going to lose money in your machines, at least serve me a cold beer."}
{"text":"Really bad service here. After we got seated it took 20 minutes to get the menu. We had to get up & go order our drinks at the bar. The hostess & waitresses here are not friendly at all. They all look pissed off. Definitely won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and the perfect spot to come if you're looking for a bunch of construction workers. I've been here 6 times at all different times from day to night and you'll be lucky to see more than five girls in here. If you did I guarantee they wouldn't be single girls. For real though do you guys give discounts to construction workers or is this just the spot??  Feel like I need to get an orange or yellow vest to blend with the crowd."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Smoking inside no matter what the sign out front says.   The place is fair the food is decent but, when you take a bite of your burger with a mouthful of cigarette smoke. Yuck. How disappointed I am arriving here.   This place does not invoke writing a beautiful review about it."}
{"text":"What is this terrible early 2000's fucking Emo music you play on a Saturday night! No one wants to cut their wrists, we want to have a good time and enjoy some top 40 at least! Driving a group of 20 out the door ruining my buddy's birthday!"}
{"text":"If you pass by this place keep in going!! My far the worst service I have ever received in Vegas.  The place was empty and it took 30 minutes to get a beer and after 40 minutes we are still waiting for our nachos.  The waitress was completely clueless, the place has 250 beer on tap and she new nothing about any of them.  Not to mention I had to ask for water 3 different times before it was brought.  I would give this place no stars.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The service on a Saturday mid morning sucks! Not busy and had to wait for cheese and red peppers for pizza at 12:30pm. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Open 24/7. Lots of tv's. Has a dart board, mini bowling alley, pool tables. Margherita pizza was good. Full bar and lots of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great bar, food needs help. People are good, but a lot of items that are on the menu, they are out of. Maybe a new cooking staff"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here the other night and we stopped at the host's booth. The host seemed busy and walked away, no server was on the floor as well. We waited 20 mins and still no one helped us.   Ill never come back to this bar."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite bars ever. I prefer the location on flamingo better but this one on Marks is still a great place. People's main complaints on here are about price and service. You get what you pay for on the pricing... tons of TVs, games, bowling, HUGE beer selection. Service has always been great for me, when they're slammed you have to expect it to take a minute to get a drink, that's normal anywhere."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out this week, it was decent! Huge beer list, which is great! A little over priced in comparison to other places when it comes to their drinks but I've read they have a happy hour. Service was good, we sat at the bar, ordered a few different drinks as well as food. The soft pretzel with beer cheese was delicious! Also tried the sunrise/morning pizza? It had an egg on top, it was really good as well! Wasn't too happy about the fact smoking is ok there and it was basically being blown in our face while we were eating, could also be because we sat at the bar. There are games and an outdoor areas- worth checking out."}
{"text":"Had great expectations. Jalapeño popper egg roll sounds great. Cheese egg roll is what I got. Chicken fingers under cooked. Chips were nasty cooked in old oil.  Comp on beers was a surprise at the end. Play an hour and a half get one beer comped.   Service at least was good. Other than not informing me the beers weren't comped.   Last time here for me."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly rude, ESPECIALLY the bartenders. If you don't have a dick, don't expect to be served withing the first 10 minutes you're there. Beer and food menus have been THROWN at me on TWO SEPARATE occasions, along with MASSIVE attitudes because I have the app... or, rather, I HAD the app. As a bartender and waitress myself, I will NOT return here. I might recommend it to people I absolutely despise."}
{"text":"LOTS of beers. Lots of TV's everywhere to watch the game. Food was pretty much your basic bar food, with higher marks for presentation (although I don't need the wire baskets reminding me that everything I'm eating is deep fried). The five stars are for my server, Kelly. Went to the bar and was ignored, so decided to get a table, which I don't like to do when I'm alone. One reason being servers hate single diners, and it usually shows in their service. Not with Kelly. She was at my table right away. Made great recommendations. Chatted with me when she wasn't busy. And made me forget about being ignored earlier (well, maybe not entirely).  Don't go to the bar. Sit at a table and ask for Kelly."}
{"text":"The food was fair to good. No complaints about their food just no 'WoW' factor either.  Prices were high as usual.  I drove from college in Henderson to go to this place in Summerlin at Tívoli Village. Parking was not good.  Fair at best. Compact areas.  Never a good thing.  But to drive from Henderson to this place?? Not a chance. If I'm in the area and a good friend wants to meet there for some reason, I'll go.  But it's not by my choosing.   Not really bad at all. Just not worth much without any WoW factor."}
{"text":"Could've been worse but really could've been better.  We stopped in for happy hour and a little dinner.  The place is very large with lots of seating around the bar as well as booths and tables.  Our service was good since we had 2 girls (one trainee).  They were very fun and friendly.  The training waitress really knew the menu well and could give us informative answers.    Unfortunately the food didn't match up to the service.  We ordered the WTF fries for the table.  They left me saying WTF?  They fries are topped with chili, cheese, bacon, jalapeños, sour cream and a fried egg.  Well you would think with all of those yummy ingredients it would be fabulous.  Not so much.  The chili was really what ruined this plate.  If you just ate the chili by itself it would not be a best seller.  Just blah.    My husband and I also split the Philly with Onion Chips.  The Philly was not bad but I asked for the mushrooms on the side.  Sadly I did not get to enjoy any mushrooms that evening.  The sandwich was accompanied by onion chips.  They were bland and needed seasoning in the batter.  It tasted as if you were eating the oil it was fried in.    The one saving grace was their Jalapeño popper egg rolls! They were made with cream cheese, cheddar and roasted jalapeños.  What was different is they were served with a grape jelly sauce.  That was definitely different but enjoyable!   For as many 24 hour establishments like PKWY, you'll find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They provided rides to and from the Vegas beer festival and hosted the after party. The owner hooked it up a limo!, yes a LIMO!! Because the bus was running late. Awesome place to hang for a few beers and food with friends!! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"2/3 of the way through the evening, the Assistant Manager decided that Jac's  (our group organizer for this event) service dog had to leave. She showed him documentation and was very cooperative.  OMG!!! He said it was a health violation since they have an open kitchen.   Good thing our group has an attorney who was present who explained ADA rights.  This ADA violation and bullying from the manager soured the night. After our attorney friend spoke up, the manager went away.  No apologies, comps, etc.  Service got slower though.  Sad!  Our group will most likely not return and we go out at least once a week."}
{"text":"Get caught up in the hype. I love the beer logs. You can log 5 beers a day with great rewards. 250 beers at the location! Myself and 3 great friends stumbled upon this sports bar.  now we meet with the friendly staff regularly to log beers. Great for sports and parties. Cheers to Parkway, bartenders are great and Sarah was very informative. Had me convinced I should live there but no cot available. Oh and the scorpion bbq wings are spicy but great flavor. I don't think i will ever try their challenge though."}
{"text":"This is a fun place. We've been here twice. They have a great selection of beer and have lots of games to play (darts, bowling, giant Jenga, corn hole, etc). However, I'm giving this 4 stars because the food is average. A few items on the menu were good. However, they charged us $13 for 3 street tacos that were dry and had hardly anything on them.  I would be cautious over ordering food items again. Our server Amanda did a great job and it was fun for Cinco de Mayo."}
{"text":"Just not really feeling the place - the space, food and employee attitudes are \"meh\"."}
{"text":"*UPDATE* My past few visits to parkway have been progressively disappointing, and I don't see myself coming as often (if at all) due to several changes to the menu and atmosphere.   The kitchen staff/authority has recently changed and it hasn't been a positive transition in my opinion. Their PKWY Bloody Mary used to be my one of my favorite versions of the drink; it was flavorful and garnished with high quality ingredients. The past couple times I have been the drink gets worse and made more incorrectly/cheaply than it used to be. The asparagus isn't being made and the breakfast slider now has a bland, frozen sausage patty instead of the homemade sausage it used to feature.   I am also docking an entire star for getting rid of their fantastic crispy breakfast potatoes with fried onions and replacing it with barely cooked sautéed potatoes with peppers and onion drenched in oil.   The atmosphere has changed dramatically too. What used to be a spacious outdoor patio for games and lounging has been reduced by almost half and obstructed by a new golf simulator barn. It's ugly and awkward, ruining the \"backyard\" vibe.   With the inconsistency in food and drinks along with the precise changes explained, I don't think I will be frequenting Parkway Tavern with the regularity I once was."}
{"text":"I have to say they have great food but service overall is slow but friendly.  I've been here on several different occasions and service is ALWAYS slow. I've sat at the bar for 5 minutes with an empty glass and was skipped over three times. Sat at tables and it was the same way."}
{"text":"Horrible bartender yesterday during the football playoffs we my husband and I went there there was two seats together at the bar when I went to send in one the lady next to me oh these seats are saved fine and I find two separate seats we order food and we gamble watching the game about 20 minutes 25 minutes into it the lady finally removes her purse and jacket and opens the seats up and the bartender during all this told us that she could save the seats. So whatever then my husband and I went to leave and I had one like $200 awesome Cashin Out and the bartender like $26 of it and I'm like excuse me so you don't get you have to pay for your drinks and I go but I was gambling the whole time oh you only get one drink for every 20 you put in really I'm sorry I won it kept me there bartender was completely rude about it and how dare him just take the money out of there. We will never go back there and I don't recommend anybody else ever going back"}
{"text":"Came here and enjoyed bites off both the happy hour menu and the regular menu. Service was a bit slow, since they just opened not too long ago. There's a lot of tables that accommodate both small and large groups. Lots of TVs available to watch all different games at the same time. Some booths also have their own personal TV. The outside area was pretty cool, but definitely much smaller than their other Southwest location. They had Jenga, Connect Four, cornhole, ping pong, and beer pong tables here.  We liked the poutine tater tots and their fish & chips. Their chip&dip and corn fritters on the happy hour menu were pretty good too.  They even have an extended happy hour for medical and education professionals M-F from 3-8 pm (regular is 4-7 pm). I'd want to go back and try other dishes, since they have all day breakfast and a really large menu. Definitely worth a visit to PKWY!"}
{"text":"This morning I arrived at the PKWY Tavern at Marks and Warm  Springs. I ordered eggs over medium. I waited over 20 minutes for the food when the eggs arrived they were so over cooked they where like rubber. The bartender was kind and returned them. They arrived back at the table less then 5 minutes. The same plate I told the bartender it was the same plate and she agreed. She asked if I would like to return them I said no and paid for my drink. Do not go to this establishment. I give 1 Star only because of the bartender. To at insult to injury there was only one other couple eating."}
{"text":"This place is a shadow of the original PKWY on Flamingo.  That's not necessarily a bad thing but I think in this case it may be but I guess it all depends on what you come here looking for.  The original definitely isn't for everyone and I can safely say I only enjoyed it a few of the times I had been there.  I believe people went to the original PKWY to get hammered, to be around smoking hot college chicks (even though they were accompanied by endless hordes of college douches), to have a good selection of beer, and all in all forget about their current problems.    This location is different.  Although it is in a nice, spacious building,  the atmosphere is totally different.  They still have the same large beer list and some over-sized games but that's about it.  There weren't throngs of people mingling and getting hammered.  The whole thing felt turned down a notch on every level.  It seemed more like an over-sized PT's than anything.  \"PT's isn't bad though\", you say; \"it's a cool local place to grab a drink and some food\".  Yes, that's true, but that's not PKWY to me.  PKWY is the Vegas embodiment of a college bar where kids go to lay off steam, get wild, be seen, and have a good time.  This place, especially on a Saturday night in summer, was not that.    This review is less about the actual place and more about the people in it, their vivacity or rather lack there of, and honestly, the people are what set the original PKWY apart from every other bar in Vegas.  Idk if it is because of the location or what but it just wasn't the same.  Maybe it was I who was just in a funk that night and not really feeling it.  That being said, I will have to give it another try but for now, there's not really anything special about this place, just a memory of what it's not."}
{"text":"Update to original review. I decided to give it one more try for breakfast. And after receiving my food will be walking across to either the IHOP nearby or Burger King. A simple breakfast of eggs, sausage and potatoes... I've had better breakfasts out of an MRE. I asked for jelly for my toast which the apparently they don't have. Instead they brought me a plastic cup of some sort of red colored syrup that I poured on my toast. I have no idea what flavor it is. The sausage patties are flattened to the size of a piece of paper, and taste like nothing but grease.   I've been in here several times now and have tried numerous things off of the menu. The food just isn't that good. Nice people working and the service is decent, just don't expect mouthwatering food"}
{"text":"Ugh this place is honestly the worst. Great potential but here's my qualms... 1. We went several times soon after they apparently got these stupid new ordering iPads that the server had to find each. individual. item. right. at. our. table. Super awkward. Me-I'll have a miller lite. Server-Looks for it on iPad. Me-were do I look. Do I stare at them until they find it. Do I rudely browse my phone. I guess the ceiling works. Me-I'll have the chicken fingers. Server-looks for it on iPad.    You get it. I get they're probably still learning but apparently they had had them for over three months at that point. It was super annoying. Good in theory.  2. The free shot during the playoffs was jager.  you can't advertise free shots for a promotional and then give the shitest (is that a word) alcohol ever. Lure em in and treat em like fools. Good in theory.  3. The area upstairs is like where they put the misfits. The table and stools ALL suck! We tried over five of the table near us to find one that didn't wobble. Nope. Napkins didn't help they were just shity tables. Not to mention there should be a bathroom up there. Again good in theory.  4. They have this presumably awesome app and you can win all the things when you try all the beers. I must be a dumbass bc I couldn't even figure in my miller light. Again....good in theory.  5. At one of our multiple visits during the playoffs we literally waited for over an hour for chicken fingers before we were told that the kitchen had quit taking orders bc they were so backed up. Umm understaffed and underprepared.  6. Their so to speak amazing elephant ear is a sham. An embarrassment of an imposter. It is fried gross cardboard pizza dough. It was served with the most disgusting chocolate sauce. And San caramel as described. It was not even chewable. In a party of 4 did not even finish it. Also, I had to ask server for said elephant ear bc it never came within the time my bf ordered and received chicken fingers that he ordered some time after. No apology. Nothing. I'm not stupid here...he didn't put the order in.   Anyway you get where this is going. I wouldn't have high hopes. All the food is only just ok."}
{"text":"Fun, really crowded big sports bar. Lights are way too bright for me. Food was good. Service was good. Def a mixed crowd. I liked it over all. I wouldn't go there at prime time and expect to find a machine at the bar or a good table. Def a good place for young people to  party and mingle."}
{"text":"First time for me! The food was great!! Gonna try the 1 at Tivoli Village!! The server Amanda was Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We've been here at least 5 times since it opened.y husband loved his biscuits and gravy breakfast the first time. I had the Monte Cristo. It's not a traditional MC. The only the slices of bread are cooked but the meat and cheese are served cold. It was hard to eat as it kept falling apart. I was thoroughly disappointed. We tried again for lunch another time. I had a burger which was just ok- very juicy but doesn't hold up to the bun and when served in a basket, you can't put it down or else the bun becomes too soggy. My husband tried the Sin City Spaghetti and enjoyed it. Next time in, hubby ordered Stroganoff and the meat was all fatty parts and inedible. For me, best option was mini corn dogs and tator tots (sooo good!). We brought friends in from out of town on the next visit. I had the turkey club and it was below par. It's really just a turkey san which with bacon in 2 slices of toasted bread. The atmosphere is fun, the games are fun but overall the food isn't worth making another trip in. It's just not great."}
{"text":"GOLDEN KNIGHT RIDERS!!!! THIS IS YOUR PLACE!. Ok so the place doesn't look like much from the outside. But when you walk in during KNIGHTS NIGHT!!! This place is pulsating....better get there early or you will be standing the whole time. There isn't a bad seat in the house. TV'S EVERYWHERE!!! they have games too, upstairs area and an outside area.  The atmosphere is ELECTRIC!!! Filled to capacity with KNIGHT fans. Everybody is cheering in unison....they pass out towels, shots, pompoms etc.,,  service was STELLAR  TOO. The Food is good too. I have had their nachos, pork sliders, chips, beer battered onion chips. All of it is good bar food. Drink specials galore. I recommend the black and gold...i can't say enough about this place. Secret is out. PKWY TAVERN in Henderson on Marks St. Is TOPS!!! When you come for a game say hi....i will probably be there. GO KNIGHTS GO!!! PKWY TAVERN YOU ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"Madison was amazing! Always is! She takes care of us every time we come in to watch sports! Seriously the best place- we highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great bartenders. Huge beer selection. I love the atmosphere. There is 1 manager I don't care for after witnessing a terrible level of professionalism. He might not even work there anymore. Haven't seen him in a while."}
{"text":"Best bartender here is Melissa. She takes such good care of us. She brought us samples of a really good selection of beers. Wish she was the bartender all the time there for us.The atmosphere is cool. The patio is too small. The entertainment offered is pretty much what I feel may have been popular back in high school. Drinks are a bit over priced. Food is ok. best menu item I have had is the side of fries."}
{"text":"Stay as far away from this far as possible. If you like craft beer I'll give you servers like options nearby with better service. The food the last two times was undercooked, and then I was over charged for it as well. I complained about the quality of the undercooked meat to the manager Sam and then Ryan the next time. Ok both instances I over heard them making rude comments to the wait staff and complaining about me wanting food that was actually cooked. Then when I got the bills it took the managers disappearing for 20-30 minutes each time before they corrected my billing issues. It's like both times they thought they could just make the customer wait a long time and then I would get frustrated with waiting's and then pay an incorrect bill. Wow!!  The last time I went in was this last Tuesday after work. I sat at a machine and just drank this time; best but still a bad idea at this bar. I put in $40 and didn't ask to log my beers in their beer club they have so according to management they should have been free. Nope they charged me for them both this time; Sam told  me they do not comp beers for players unless you are gambling my Over $200 I asked where that rule is written and she just got angry with me, threw back in my face the complaining I did the last time about food and then told me I was being aggressive. Apparently this bar, Sam and Ryan the managers like to call people names rather then fix their own issues. Stay away unless you want to get sick and get told off by a manager.  For good craft beer and a local feel check out World of Beer, Crafhaus and Bad Beat Brewing which are all with 3 miles of zzz PKWY Marks. Also check out The Tap up in Boulder City which has a cool rotating selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"Came in with my co-workers to hang out. I didn't order any food, but everyone in our party was happy with their orders.  Half of or party went up to the second floor to play pool and the other half went outside to play corn hole and Jenga.   We all had a good time. We'll probably come here again next time we hang out."}
{"text":"Always a good time when I come here. Staff is friendly and super knowledgeable on the different items on the menu....oh yeah and they have a trillion different types of beers to choose from...love the bar set up! The boys and I like to unwind there after a rough day at work. Keep up the great work PKWY Tavern team!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this bar. We went here for a birthday and to watch the nba game. There were approx 10-15 people in our group. Nice place to chill since they have outdoor games and beer selection. The service was TERRIBLE!!! We were waiting 15-20minutes to order. Not 1 waitress came to our table ONCE so we ordered food and drinks at the bar. We get to the bar & the bartenders weren't attentive. We had to wait a long time just to order and get the check. There was no eye contact and they were cleaning rather than helping customers. Keep in mind the waitresses weren't busy and were standing around. Having to hunt down someone to order is not a good customer experience. It's unfortunate they have terrible customer service otherwise I think this place would be great. Good luck to the owners."}
{"text":"Great place - good service -very clean - lots to do and good music.  Prices could be better !   Will definitely go back and see updates"}
{"text":"I talked my neighbor into trying this place out.  We went on a Friday at 5pm.  The parking lot was full. We were hoping this was a good sign.  The inside was only 1/4 full.  We ordered two drafts.   My Mic Ultra was out of stock. Ultimately we each had one draft pint each during happy hour for $13 and change before tip. The menu did not look appealing.  The atmosphere was off in our opinion.  We both agreed we would have been much better off going down the street to Miller's Ale house next time.   Your experience may be different."}
{"text":"There's some cool games there but don't gamble. We usually gamble a lot and between my husband and i... we blew about $300 and we still had a bar tab for all of our drinks. It was only 30 something dollars cause we didn't stay long... but I would rather go to Henry's cause they appreciate our business and give us a drink for gambling"}
{"text":"Rhonda is always the best, she knows what we like and is always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great atmosphere for any sports events (specially for any of the Vegas Golden Knights games), bar food and really good service!!"}
{"text":"Avoid happy hour menu items. Tiny portions. For 5 bucks got about a cup of pretzel bites,   sauce not included. Maybe a dozen of the potato slices are in a portion but at least that came with sauce. For 8 bucks you get the giant pretzel with beer sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.  Overcooked burger / Overcooked fries / Pretty sure the Bloody Mary came from a can.  Horrible service.   I would rather go to the IHOP across the parking lot for a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"On multiple occasions my wife and I have come here and had horrible service. Waiting for a long time for someone to even a acknowledge us. Waiting long enough that we have legitimately discussed just getting up and leaving. When they have helped us it has been a crap shoot. Servers that do not know the drinks they have and items on the menu that they are out of. Honestly, if you are thinking of coming here, just go a mile down the road and there are numerous places just like it that have good service"}
{"text":"Frozen turkey burger party which they forgot to put the cheese on took 30 minutes to bring to the table with water no ice that taste like dish rag. All of that for 14.00. One of the very worst dining experiences I have ever had. Stay away, there are plenty of small pubs / taverns that do everything much better."}
{"text":"Came here a couple months ago for the Interesting Bloody Mary and were very surprised at the quality of the food and the service! This has become our regular 'happy hour' dinner spot every week! The food is really good, happy hour (most every dish) is tasty and food is great both in selection and flavor. Service is always excellent, had 20+ for happy hour the other nite and we were totally taken care of!!! A definite gem in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on 3/9/17 for happy hour. Service was terrible. Took the waitress forever to attend to  us and when she did it seemed she was more interested in trying to figure out her service tablet than dealing with actual customers. Prices on beer are way too much also. $7.50 for a pint of New Castle is asking a lot when your service is less than desirable. Place has tremendous potential and hopefully the owner gets someone in here who actually knows how to run a bar properly."}
{"text":"Met a friend Wednesday evening for Happy Hour. The hostess and wait staff were excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. Our waitress, Amanda, checked on us over and over, even after we had paid the bill and were still sitting there talking. They weren't crowded so, at times we had multiple wait staff at our table. I asked for beer recommendations and they took time to find out what kind of beer I like before they made suggestions. One of the waiters brought me a few samples before I made a decision.   We only had appetizers but, what we tried was very good. I ordered the Poutine and my friend had the mozzarella sticks. The Poutine was made with tater-tots covered in a very tasty brown gravy and feta cheese. Mozzarella sticks appeared to be house made; they definitely did not look like they came out of a box. We had planned to order dinner but, the portion size of the appetizers were so large we were stuffed when finished.   I'd love to give PKWY -Marks St. 5 stars but, I'm only giving them 4 because of two things. First, the music was so loud it was almost impossible to talk. We were yelling across the table the whole time. The kind of yelling that makes your throat hurt very quickly. This noise level kind of ruined the experience for me. Secondly, they have a happy hour \"small bites\" menu but, it's very limited. There were only a few items to choose from at three different price points ($5, $6, $7). I would have liked to see more on this menu so, we could have tried a bigger variety of their offerings.   I will come back and try them out again but, if the music is still extremely loud I probably won't return. I can't express how annoying the volume level was. It was 5:00 pm and the music was turned up to a 10:00 pm \"partying level.\" Definitely not an early evening dinner type ambiance."}
{"text":"Most days are good but today was different. There was nobody here but still couldn't get any service. People being rude (not really their fault) and the burger I ordered was so under cooked it was still breathing on me. Normally I love coming to this place with all of my friends, but last night was just a different story. I'll probably still come for their next crazy huge event party. Hopefully they can redeem themselves. This place is usually awesome. Today was lacking though."}
{"text":"Great food! Fish and chips are the best I have had in a long time. Lots of beer chooses and happy hour prices are decent. Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Well although I had fun with some of the bartenders I was disheartened at this place to have a hostess hold a table for us when we moved from the bar because our party grew that for 2 hours not one server came to ask for our order. Then to find out by witnessing our nice hostess has to clean the puke from the bathroom sinks was also another ding because other than one bartender she was about customer service.  After all this I observed as I sat at the bar to get my bill to be passed over by 5 other people who walked up after me get asked for help to find out the one bartender who was more customer service oriented vs. getting the buck on a busy night gave me the bill I had waited 20 mins for. Ya no and they have a good happy hour and bloody Mary I am so irritated!"}
{"text":"Awesome brand-new place with a view and I'll be giving broom and great food dozens of beers. My brother had a really good stout and I had an awesome prime rib sandwich with spicy sauce. Their grand opening is soon but are open now. Bartenders are great food is awesome definitely check this place out. Definitely not your typical pub"}
{"text":"Just meh, food not hot, beer not cold..long wait ..after leaving 75percent of our food,  we left to eat at bww.."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and helpful! Made us feel right at home a MUST for the best chicken wings in town! Cant wait for The Karaoke DJ Dance Party to start on tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"I was excited about this place as I usually am about anywhere that has a large and deep beer selection. However, the food here will make me move on next time I think about stopping in.  I ordered the chicken sliders. Not only was the chicken very bad and fried too long, it was said to come with \"house made bread and butter pickles\" on the sandwich. I dig that. What I don't dig is a single, tiny, very thin pickle on each sandwich.   Really? A single pickle?  They also had a lot of TVs, but all on the same channel. What's the point?"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  After a long day of work my Husband and I were looking for a new place for a quick bite and drinks.  What a delight. Great place. Lots of fun activities such as darts and jenga.   Ask for Tyler. He is superb.  Could not ask for better service.  Food is exceptional."}
{"text":"We tried this place for Sunday breakfast. It was a total disaster. Service was slow and not very friendly. My wife wanted hot tea but they don't have hot tea. She had a tea bag so just asked for a cup of hot water. We had to ask 3 times just to get the water. Finally got our food and were very disappointed. The sausage tasted terrible. The toast was dry Texas toast with no butter. My wife visited the women's restroom and said it was disgusting. It obviously hadn't been cleaned from the night before.  Only one stall was even useable because of filth. We definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Got the fish and chips. It was horrible. Not only was there fish 3 little things that looked like fish sticks, But they were soaked in oil. Nasty! THe fries were also soggy and nasty. Probably wont be going back. The bartender was nice, that was the only redeeming quality. Not to mention that the Fish and Chips was 13.95 Rip off!!"}
{"text":"Walked in for \"brunch.\"  There were about 5 people at the bar and one lady in a booth.  We were not even acknowledged. Just simply ignored.  We got our own menus from hostess stand.  We waited about 10m with catching a glimpse of a bartender.  We were sitting at high top table.  We noticed a server walk in the front door.  Appeared just coming on.  She came over a couple min later.  Sooo after about 10min wait we finally got a server.  My husband ordered a Pepsi. I ordered a mimosa. My mimosa was piss warm.  Gross! My husband pop didn't taste right.  No apology when he said anything.  He switched to water.  I didn't say anything about the mimosa. I figured at this point, pointless.  The ice water took about 5 m to get.  At least our food was hot! That was only good point.   I then switched to a bloody Mary.  Can I say I've never had a bloody without a single condiment? Not even a lime or olive at least! For $9 I would expect something.   I was very disappointed.  Not even the patio was up and able to use.  We used to visit the other location and never had an issue.  We just moved to this side of town and trying places out. Sadly it will be awhile before we try again."}
{"text":"Cool bar, but they kept playing 16 year old high Schooler emo music. We as a group of 10 people asked multiple times to change the music and the answer was \"it's a corporate loop we can't\". What bar does not have control over the music? Seriously, very disappointed in this bar."}
{"text":"I ordered the greek salad with chicken. It was very good. Chicken was moist and not over dressed. Service was fast. Nice lil hang out spot"}
{"text":"This place is new in my area I thought I would try it one morning. I sat at the bar for 20 minutes and no one even acknowledged I was there. Although the food look good I cannot give you review because they did not serve me. They were not even busy and they were very few people there mid afternoon on Saturday.! What does that tell you about this place!"}
{"text":"Just opened yesterday. Really friendly staff. Huge space. Like the Flamingo store on steroids. Of course they have the great beer list like the other two. Plenty of games to keep busy. Great food and they have new bites during happy hour. This should be the new spot to hang in Henderson."}
{"text":"Three stars for the beer selection. Food is lousy. Ordered pretzles and cheese dipping sauce. The pretzles were cardboard, and cheese sauce was disgustinf watery reconstituted cheese substitute. When I eat out, I want good food, not disgusting trash."}
{"text":"Some of the worse service I have received. Took awhile to get menus. Order our beers then we were asked if we wanted to order food, we said yes, multiple bartenders walked by and never asked what we wanted for our food order. One bartender did take our menus without asking if we wanted to order. We gave up on food and sat with our glasses empty for more than 15 mins and trying to get our check but no one would make eye contact."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I really like the crowd. Weekends are a bit crowded but hey it's the weekend lol. But I had a few different beers and they were all extremely good. One of my favorite is the peanut butter stout :) must try! I also like their French fries and also had the spinach dip. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Just a quick update. No refund has been received to date July 1, 2018. I appreciate all that you have done so far  Thank you"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place. They have a couple of game tables on one side with a few more table games, sit down dining with tables and booths in the middle and an outside area too. Every time I went it was full and everyone seemed to be having a great time. They were also passing out full glasses of different ciders to try."}
{"text":"Here at 10:20pm. Place wasn't busy...Would of been nice to be served.. all three servers looked at us but kept walking around. Won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Nice inside remodel,very friendly staff! Came for breakfast and was disappointed in the food, homemade sausage was just ground hamburger! Will comeback for the nice atmosphere not the food!"}
{"text":"Who knew???  Super great beer selection and being a guest at the Holidays Inn next door gets me a nice discount off my tab. My server Madison was great and gave honest opinions to my selections. I ordered the Jalapeño Poppers served with grape jelly and an order of stout beer soaked wings with a Habanero Mango dipping sauce. I kid you not..... over 100 beers on tap and more than 100 available in bottle. Screw the Strip come here!!"}
{"text":"First, this is a bar that serves food only to stay legal for its gaming license.  The food isn't that great. It's bar food, burgers and sandwiches. Be warned.  For drinking purposes they have 250 beers, and many on tap.   They have a good Happy Hour and a good customer loyalty program for paying customers but a terrible customer loyalty program for gamblers.   Their Video Poker sucks (short payables as expected from places like this) but they do easily  comp players, even 25c players.   If you want to drink this is a good place. If you want a good meal or full pay games go somewhere else.  Food comps are tough, you have to be a real player to get them."}
{"text":"I love this place just for the food menu. The best thing on the menu is the poutine tater tots which are tater tots topped with brown gravy and feta cheese. They have a few beers on tap which makes me happy because I'm a girl. Places close to my home which makes me like it more also enjoy the fact that there's games and all kinds of stuff for you to do as it's not your traditional bar"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and a delicious Bloody Mary bar. Friendly staff and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Came in here on a thur night for a quick bite with a coworker. The parking lot was pretty packed, but the inside was not too crazy. They have some nice comfortable booths, a bar area in the middle and no shortage of TVs. Overall environment was very clean - I hope they can keep it this way! They have a huge jenga game outside as well as some other activities. There's also some billiard tables upstairs and a two lane bowling alley.  Pretty cool.  As far as food, Dereck was our server and he was very professional. He was never more than a few feet away and was always checking to make sure we didn't need anything.  I ended up getting a pork belly burger.  It was good, they had their own signature spicy sauce on it. The pork belly and burger patty portions were good and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed it but didn't care for the fries- they were kind of tasteless in my opinion.  Good atmosphere, good food, good service - why 4 stars? Well, overall value - my burger bill with a coke came out to $17.  Eek. In short, this may be a better place to hang out and grab a beer/appetizers than coming for a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Sports pub located in the Las Vegas suburbs.  The restaurant had a large bar, a dining area, and plenty of indoor and outdoor bar games to play.  The beer selection was impressive and the waitress let me taste of few samples before I decided on my selection.  We started off with the poutine tater tots. It was pretty good and a large portion. I wanted to try the Monte Cristo sandwich but they were out of the ingredients to make it. I opted for the pork sliders. Not great but not terrible, definitely on the dry side.  I'll probably come back for the beer and games, but probably not the food."}
{"text":"Great service!! and lots of game to play-video poker, mini bowling alley, beer pong/ flip cup."}
{"text":"A clean bar style restaurant with decent food and good service. They have a good Happy Hour menu and large beer selection including local beers.  My husband and I started with Street Corn Fritters. These were just okay, but didn't have much flavor. The portion was large enough for a few people to share. I went with PKWY Nachos (add chicken) for my dinner and thought they were pretty good. The portion was giant and would make for a good item to share between a couple of people. My husband had the Fried Mozz Burger. You guessed it, this was giant too. My husband really enjoyed his meal.   Our waitress was attentive and friendly. All of our food items came out quickly. Definitely no complaints on the service here."}
{"text":"I had to pick three beers before I could get one they actually had so don't be too impressed by their beer selection. The food was inedible and they brought us a pretzel without a plate under it and the salt is ALL OVER the table now. I don't know man, I want to really love this place and I'm trying hard but it's absolutely disputable because the table was filthy when we sat down. I don't think I want to drink here again. Will update after I try bar games and hopefully it's a lot better!"}
{"text":"This place has no idea how to do business!  We came with a group of 12. We are a Meetup group that is local and I am an organizer. One of the other organizers, who actually scheduled the Meetup, has a very small service dog. The manager, who understood that the dog was a service dog, said we couldn't have the service dog in the restaurant because his restaurant couldn't operate with a service dog in the premises since he restaurant was open. That means the restaurant shouldn't be operating!  Their desire to operate a kitchen does not override the Americans with Disabilities Act!  Dumb, management and owners who likely have just bought themselves a health violation (operating a restaurant with a dog on the premises AND and ADA complaint. How amazingly stupid! God knows what other things they do. We were also considering bringing the group here once a month, now that definitely isn't happening!  Losing business and alienating locals at a new loca"}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon, it's a tavern pub type place so it was pretty empty when we got there. This is definitely a fun place if you love food, beer and games for adults. Food was great, they have over 100 beers on tap and plenty of seating. I would like to go in the evening time for the full experience. Overall awesome place"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a late night dinner and drinks.  Environment: like the other parkway tavern, it is usually pretty busy and loud. Most people come here to drink, watch sports and have fun with friends. They have a cool outdoor patio and a screen where you can compare yourself with others on how many beers you have had there. They also have some cool reward system.   Service: I would say it was average. I liked my waitress who was quick to get our orders and fill our drinks. I thought it was strange though when one of the food runners went to two different tables with our food to see if they ordered it before he realized it was ours.   Food and drinks: they have a lot of beer options and mixed drinks. When I came, I ordered the cheese burger with bacon sliders and WTF chili fries. To be completely honest, they did not taste good at all :( the bread for the burger was dry and hard to chew. The patty itself was really dry. The chili fries had good toppings but the they were kind of cold which is really off putting when you expect it to be warm chili on warm fries. I don't expect much from bar food but this was pretty bad in comparison to other bars I have been too.  Overall, I feel like this is a fun place to grab drinks and get a good buzz with friends. The bar food probably only taste good when you get drunk and have the drunchies."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Too big for the amount of bartenders. Spent 50$ waiting to place my drink order.  No way would I have gotten a refill in under 200$. Oh and the water, even with lemon in it, was horrid so bad I'm surprised someone hasn't gotten sick yet"}
{"text":"Worst service ever and every time I've tried calling in an order late night apparently phones don't work or the bartender is too busy posting on social media because they NEVER answer food is great service awful"}
{"text":"Tried a new place. Great beer selection. Lousy service. About 8 minutes until they talked to us. Had to ask for menus. They took the menus from us without taking our order. We say here staring at all the bartenders and they refused to make eye contact with us. They even cleaned the bar and wiped it down around us all while sitting for 10 minutes with empty beers. Asked for the check and left.   No thank you brosef bar- just because I'm not a man doesn't mean I don't get service."}
{"text":"I had fun! The food was good. I had the WTF fries, they were bomb. The drinks were reasonable. I had whiskey coke for 5 bux. The bartenders were cool. One dude was drunk and trying to argue with the bartender but she stood her ground.   I played connect 4 with my friends. It was a pretty laid back night. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food, service, prices, music, and beer selection! We went to watch the Cavs-Boston game (Yes! Cavs won!), and it was our first time there. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To expensive for a local bar almost strip prices. Good draft beer selection but it's always warm, food is good but service is slow 30-1hr wait for food I'll rather go to sunset station up the street"}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere. We had a blast defiantly coming back to this local spot! More beers to try out! Plenty to choose from"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pleasant crowd. A few reviewers have stated they prefer the original Tavern off Flamingo, but I prefer this one for its older crowd; enjoying different selections of beer. Bartenders were social and provided great service at 8:00pm on a Friday. Large beer selection and really good appetizers; especially the giant pretzel. I'm going back just for that!!"}
{"text":"First time here, Summer our server is amazing! She helped us with our beer selection, which she was very knowledgeable in. It's people like her that enjoy their job, is why we'll be back. Their food as well as their sauces are made from scratch. The atmosphere is great, lots for young people to do. Thanks Summer for the free shirts and awesome time. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I live  a few blocks from this place and and AWESOME!!!! Yes there's a huge selection of beers to choose from. And bartenders are so cool and friendly not to mention very informative!!! ( Dave the bartender Rocks ) ( gotta get the right beer right? ) drink the right one or don't drink at all. Nice! Great patio seating and TV galore everywhere. So you won't miss out on the game your watching. Hey this will me my new neighborhood bar. Place can be packed during g army game nights so i guess play your game night watching accordingly and start heading up early right here so you can have your pupu platters ( appetizer) and drink here . We will definitely be back here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to hang out with friends or to relax after work. It's like an adult playground, there's alchy and fun games to play with! Obviously there are times when it gets crowded and a group of people are playing with jenga for example, the common tavern courtesy is to play a game or two, then pass it on to the next group of people who does the same. However, there are game hoggers - BOOOOO! Don't be one of them. My group of friends are pretty chill so whenever we are playing a game there we'd just invite the group to play with us waiting. I mean Pkwy is definitely a place to unwind and socialize so might as well use the games for that purpose!"}
{"text":"While I'm not a huge fan of the Southwest location, this location in particular was even more \"un-funner\", but thankfully minus the millennial takeover on Saturday nights. The drinks are still over priced, not much for specials except their happy hour 3-6 M-F. The seating is good for large and smaller parties, which you can't find indoors at the southwest location.  Service was super slow, but from what I could tell my waitress was working alone in a busy area.   I tried an order of mozzarella sticks, they were actually very delicious, made differently with a huge cup of marinara sauce, Unfortunately they only come in orders of four.  I definitely like their beer selection, but probably won't find myself coming here on a regular."}
{"text":"Nice spot to hang out, but not as charming as other locations.  Environment: It was my first time coming to this location of Parkway Tavern, having been to the location at Tivoli Village most frequently, and I was pleasantly surprised walking in. The Interior is very open and there are TVs EVERYWHERE. Additionally, they do have a patio area like the other locations and overall the inside gives off a very outgoing and social vibe. Also, it was full but not too crowded which was nice, because the other locations have the tendency to get packed to the point of discomfort.  Food: They have an extensive beer list including numerous IPAs (my favorite), and the food menu was standard for bars. We got sliders and the chili fries, and while they were good I would say that they were also underwhelming. The food was somewhat lukewarm and seemed lacking in freshness. I know it's bar food, so I wasn't expecting gourmet food, but it still was a little below average compared to the food at other comparable bars.  Service: Our server was a little quirky but she was nice and attentive, checking up on us often and refilling our drinks. Additionally, other members of the staff stopped by and checked up on us as well throughout our stay as well.  Overall, I would come back because the location is good, and there are not a whole lot of bars like this in Henderson, however it will most likely be for drinks and to hang out as opposed to dining.."}
{"text":"Always saw great Instagram pics of this place and been wanted to try it out for a while.  We got in and it has an upscale sport bar look.  This place had a small bowling alley there and dart boards to use.  The bar has a great selection of beers to try adn great specials.  I got tea and water, yes, tea in a tavern, dont shoot me!  We started with the fried mushrooms which were great also.  I think they used tiny portebello instead of the white mushrooms.  They were awesome!  I ordered the Fish & Chips and the fish was fried just right and fish was hot & flakey.  My Uncle got the Burger & Fries which he says was great tasting.  The atmosphere in the place is amazing, and the music in the area is great."}
{"text":"The other PKWY Taverns on the west side of town were simply just too far for me to travel to before, especially if drinking was on the agenda. This location on Marks is so convenient and is quickly skyrocketing up the ranks as one of my favorite local bars. The beer selection is top notch, happy hour is a great deal, the food is delicious, and there's plenty to do to pass time.  My wife and I have come here for happy hour multiple times and there's a bonus for us because education and medical professionals get an extra hour of discounted food and drink. Domestic drafts, well drinks, and wines are $3. For food, there are plenty of $5, $6, and $7 options.  PWKY Tavern also caters to the beer drinker, they carry over 250 beers and have a beer loyalty program that tracks every beer you drink with rewards starting after 50 beers are consumed. Boy, I've got some work to do. Make sure you download the PKWY app so you can track those beers, have access to the full menu, and receive alerts about special events. The next upcoming event is a four course pairing of Firestone Walker beer with Hawaiian themed food courses.  With a ping pong table, mini bowling alley, corn hole, Jenga, Golden Tee, etc., you'll have plenty to do if you don't want to just have a seat and catch a game on one of many of the televisions. The kicker for me, is the cork dart boards. There's no paying per game, no plastic darts breaking, no scoring errors, and no worries about darts not sticking. My buddy and I logged in about 3 hours on the board playing cricket and slugging down beers during the Final Four.  I have no complaints about the food either. Everything is made from scratch and made to order. I've had pretty much the whole happy hour menu. You can't go wrong with the street tacos and sliders. The Belly Burger with topped with a super thick slice of pork belly, pickled red onions, and scorpion sauce (which is their hottest sauce) is one of the better burgers I've had in a while. Don't forget, breakfast is served 24/7 also.  I haven't had one issue with service in all my visits, even the early ones when they first opened when you're usually going to have some growing pains. I'm pretty easy to serve though, just don't let me have an empty glass in front of me. The only negative is the awful, carcinogenic smoke if you get too close the bar. But the space is large enough where you can distance yourself and the effects aren't that bad. There's no doubt this won't stop me from coming back because there's so much food and beers yet to try."}
{"text":"PKWY has 3 locations, and I'm so glad they brought one to Henderson! Great food, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and an amazing beer selection. What more can you really ask for?"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Killer craft beer choices and a copious amount of local beer...ask for Chelsea she's a babe and so much fun and super knowledgeable of the menu and paring drinks with food!!!"}
{"text":"Monday night, my lady and I wanted to go out for dinner neither of us had been to parkway tavern so we gave it a try we got sat down at 6:41pm right before happy hour ended wasn't to busy, looked over the menu. No one came by to get our drink order, the server did say she'll be back to help us.....never did, saw her talking to another table all in all, straight up unacceptable I work in the food and beverage industry,if I were slammed or couldn't keep up with my tables I would've asked a coworker to get my drink order...etc don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great TV monitors food's decent problem was bartender spent more time hanging out with the shift change bartenders and Cooks then the patrons at the bar!"}
{"text":"So Im going to just give this 3 stars for now but I DO want to come back and give it another shot. They have a lot of cool incentives to come with rewards program. Plus they're new on this side of town.   So you have to download their app and then you can check out all the menu items and the beer, wine and cocktail list. But sadly not all the beers were available on the list. My husband struck out 3 times and me once on beers we requested. This is a new franchise that opened so I expect they'll get better. Plus they didnt have all the wines either that's listed on app.   As for food, I got the bacon/cheddar sliders. Not impressed, very dry and didnt come with any sauce. Had to ask for the usual condiments like mayo, ketchup and mustard. But my husband's meal on the otherhand was great! He got the Big cheese and tomato soup. I might have to get that next time. I wanted to get wings but as so many places these days they dont consider those who dont like spicy. They only have spicy options unless I want bbq or teriyaki.    Lots of fun games to play so would love to bring a group and have some fun."}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic 24/7 menu,  especially for a gaming bar.  Love the bartenders.  And let's not forget the traditional PKWY Tavern oversized Jenga, Battleship, and Uno. That's in addition to basketball, cool patios, and a sweet location at Tivoli Village. They also have really good live music on Tuesdays and a DJ on the weekends if you are ready to get your dance party on."}
{"text":"Came to check out the new location. Still needs a lot of work. Walls are bare and 2nd floor and patio are not finished but I think there's great potential.   Still not super busy since they haven't done a grand opening yet and I don't even think people know they're open.   It's pretty spacious inside, plenty of bar seating and TVs around the bar.  Once the patio opens up and the weather is nice, this will definitely be a great place to hang on this side of town. Until then, the vibe/ atmosphere is lacking a bit.   Same menu but they added some new items for happy hour like corn fritters, garlic parmesan pretzel bites, a taco trio and chips with queso dip for $5 and $6.    I'm glad we checked out this new location but I'll definitely stick to the Flamingo PKWY for the vibe and since it's closer :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm totally addicted to the PB& J (pork belly and jalapeno jam.  So unbelievably good.  I also love their $10 meal in a glass - a bloody mary with a slider and other goodies.  Service is always friendly and quick.  Atmosphere is fun.  Good music and never too loud.  Fantastic beer selection."}
{"text":"The place has good food and a great beer selection. It is very expensive though. Last time I went, it cost me $7 for a pint of miller light. There  is way too much competition to pay that much."}
{"text":"Came for the first time. Since new owners. I have to say my waiter was excellent. Great service. I ordered vodka tonics but I guess the bartender ran out of vodka. The drinks are super weak. Happy hour food specials are good to go. If you're coming for drinks during happy hour my suggestion is that you tailgate in the parking lot before you come in."}
{"text":"This place kind of sucks. The staff is nice enough, but nothing special. Our food took for-ev-er, and they served my veggie burger in one of those hipster baskets that makes it impossible to eat. Trying to cut it in half in that thing was a mess, and I immediately dropped burger all over myself because I didn't have a proper plate to eat over. Mozz sticks were incredibly bland, my boyfriend's sandwich was stale, my veggie burger was gross (spicy BBQ sauce + guac = puke city). Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Great service, even at 4:00 AM. The food was so good and it has a fun environment. The server took great care of us. I would come back here again and again."}
{"text":"The place seems cool. It was aaight, a measly meh'. I went for happy hr and I got 2 sliders, 2 oz small handful of potato chipth and a mini cup of ketchup for $7 bucks. It was an \"Ok'\" srvc cause when I got the food, they didn't checkup on me if I needed anything else besides the tab. Nevertheless, I'm already used to it."}
{"text":"So, we came in here for happy hour. Monday-Friday 4-7pm. $3 beers, well drinks, wine. $5-$7 shareable bites. Not too shabby for the Henderson area. They have a big bar area, a bunch of tables and booths on the inside, and a patio seating area outside. We sat at the booths near the mini bowling alley area which is pretty nice. The service was quick and friendly. We got the fried mozz, beer battered Buffalo wings, and spicy chicken tacos. I really liked the fries mozz and wings. My friend wasn't too excited about the chicken tacos for it was just shredded chicken with jalapeños on top. Nothin else inside. But other than that, it was good food for a bar place. We wanna try the shrimp tacos or something on the main menu next time. He was looking at that philly cheese steak which sounds yummzzz. Hopefully we'll make it out one night to play the big games on the patio!"}
