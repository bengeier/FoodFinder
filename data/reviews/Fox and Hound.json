{"text":"Only went there once, but I really thought the large servings of fish and chips and chicken tenders were *excellent.*  They were hearty and tasted great-- with excellent ratio of breading to chicken/fish.  The clothes they made the women wear were a bit suspect, almost Hooter-ish.  Nevertheless, check out the chicken strips."}
{"text":"$2 Tuesdays.  Great place for drinks, bar food, and a few rounds of pool."}
{"text":"Even though I've passed this place for years, I never quite made my way in. Something about its location in a shopping mall made it seem a little less attractive.   When it was time for holiday shopping, I changed my mind.  Even though the outside is plain, the inside has a surprisingly nice atmosphere. There are multiple rooms and nooks--you can sit at the bar, play pool, grab a table, or line up along a counter. There were also a bunch of TVs playing a mix of music videos and football games. The beer selection is above average.   A cool perk: Hundreds of personalized mugs hanging on the wall. Something about walking into a bar and pulling your stein off a hook seems remotely fun.   The wings were edible, but not a reason to come. The fact that you can get a half-Guinness, half-cider from the tap is."}
{"text":"The food was descent especially the pretzel bites! Service was ok at best.  The bathroom was dirty and unattended to.  Just didn't seem like the place was run well."}
{"text":"Even for bar food this is low quality. The entire place is dirty. The bar is expensive for the product they're pouring. I don't know that the taps have ever been cleaned there... Avoid at all costs. The best thing about the experiences I have had there is that they hold the doors open for you on the way out so you can escape that much faster."}
{"text":"Great food, especially their hamburgers, and their very friendly wait staff does a fantastic job with seating, initial and continuing service. Great sports venue with multiple TVs, located so that they're visible. Whatever your team, there will probably be many rooting the same. Bill"}
{"text":"This place has overpriced drinks and horrible food. A friend of mine once found a razor blade in his food and others have gotten sick from the food (not the beer). The bar food is bland and dangerous, better bar food is down the street at the Hop House.    They play the worst pop music known to man kind, its like listening to Backstreet Boys and Nickleback on repeat. The only plus to this bar it is that is non-smoking."}
{"text":"I attended an informal business meeting here a while back and I was really impressed with the level of service.  Waitresses were around often but were not intrusive or pushy.  The manager was also making the rounds to make sure everyone was being taken care of.  If you can't relax, have fun and enjoy yourself in this place perhaps you need to look inward my friend."}
{"text":"I'm indifferent. It's close to work so I've been here a few times to catch the Pens play.  Overpriced drinks,  overpriced (fried) food. Got french fries w/ cheese,  bacon,  and ranch on the side. Was good but not worth the 8.95.  The one night I sat watching the game for about 30 minutes having managers and about 6 waitresses pass me by without saying a word. Eventually I stopped what I believed to be a manager and asked if I get service that I've been sitting here 30 minutes with nothing ignored. He sent someone over her response \"sorry I didn't see you\". Was really irritating but saved me money I guess.  Figured maybe they'd buy me my first $5.00 small glass of yuengling but nope. Oh well.  If I ever want to go watch low quality projecting tvs, drink overly expensive drinks ($4.00 small draft as a special?  Come on...) and overpay for food I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is kind of pricey, so try to stick with the specials. I do like the atmosphere here, especially in comparison to the other bars in the area. It is nice inside and fairly large. I would stick with just getting regular bar food as well, such as burgers or appetizers. Most of the other foods aren't so good. I tried the chicken enchiladas and they came in the form of eggrolls!?"}
{"text":"If you come on the right day this place is pretty great.  They have awesome happy hours like 2 dollar Tuesdays.  Now with that said my friends and I came here frequently back in the day (2-3 years ago).  Since I could remember the service has always been extremely hit or miss (usually miss).  The food is, well, average.  Nothing really spectacular other than the fact they have sweet potato fries.    I would not recommend watching a UFC event here.  There is a $10 cover and they shove you in some dark room.  The one time I wish I had a crappy waitress that never really stops by is the day I get the exact opposite. I kind of wish she wouldn't come by every 5-10mins. The seats are ok but the only kind of TVs in the room where the old school big screen TVs.  Not one LCD..."}
{"text":"Very underrated!! When we are looking for a great burger with the perfect fried egg, this is our go to place. We never have to wait for a table and the service is always great. Everyone here is super friendly. I almost don't want to post this review because I'm afraid we'll have to start to wait for a table here if more people start to go."}
{"text":"Pricey unless you go on $2 Tuesday or you drink whatever their special is. The pool tables are so nice to have and make for a nice atmosphere. Parking is sort of crazy on busy nights because people can't seem to understand the concept of the yellow lines, so I park further away. The food is ok."}
{"text":"20 mins to get service and then another 30 waiting for drinks. Went to the bar to find out what was going on. They finally told us they were looking for the alcohol that goes in the drinks...BS!! Avoid this place like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night and we didn't enjoy it.  PROS: - The temperature was very good inside - They give out a nice take home bag  CONS: - This place is a sportsbar but has an \"English Pub & Grille\" sign. I always assumed it was some old English place for old people. - LOUD with few normal sized tables - The glasses were small, loaded with ice and very clearly plastic. We needed refils 3 times and the waitress was hard to find. - The appetizers came less than 2 minutes before the meal. We didn't get to enjoy them at all and they were a waste of money. - The appetizers also looked nothing like they did on the website and were too expensive($16.99 for the appetizer platter) - Our hotdogs came in buns way too small and it was more like eating them off of a cracker - They just put too much of a spin on everything. The hot dogs were on pretzel buns, not normal buns. The cheese sticks came with jelly. The main meal arrived on a cutting board with newspaper.  Overall thoughts: It wasn't a good experience and we won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I dig this chain of bars only because of their Tuesday Pint Night (never been on another night). $2 and around 20 beers on tap? A deal to me! Been to these places in Kansas and Colorado, and the Peoria locations is probably the most lackluster. Doesn't have the crowd or ambiance I've come to expect at other locations on Pint Nights. Food is meh; greasy bar fare that is only delicious when you're 5 sheets to the wind. Bartenders are typically cool, waitresses are so-so."}
{"text":"We schedule happy hours for our high school classes here and we are always so well taken care of.  We reserve the upstairs area and there is plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, eat, play pool or darts, or just hang out.  The waitresses are always great and the food is good too.  It's a great place to have any kind of get together for a large party or just to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"We have been here for a private even and for a Motorcycle Race event.....both times we were very happy with the service, drink and food!  We sat at the bar for the races and even there the service was superb!!   Actually thinking of having a private going away party."}
{"text":"I went here on Friday night and had an excellent time. Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal. We got an order of wings and the firecracker spinach artichoke chicken (I think that's what it was called). If for nothing else, I will be returning to eat that again! They had a big open room wit pool tables that you can rent, so we played for a bit. Although I suck, it was still pretty fun and the tables were nice. After our meal, the manager came over t ask us how everything was and gave us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit.   This was the best food, service and overall great dining experience I have had in a while. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Apps are good... but been here for an hour at 6:30 on a Friday (waiting about an hour) and still waiting to get my meal. There are 2 \"hostesses\" but open seating? But found an open table... that was cleared but not wiped off. Was told they were so busy (with open tables all over) that the kitchen was backed up a half hour. The waitress came over about every 20 minutes. My wife was served a salad with no dressing, and it took about 15 minutes to get some. I would come back... on Wednesday afternoons. Try the fish."}
{"text":"...good food. ...lots of TV. ...beer. That pretty much describes my ideal bar."}
{"text":"Music way too loud. Cannot have conversation without almost yelling"}
{"text":"Most of the waitress  are a little ditsy, but there are a few, very few that are good. When we go to Harkins Arrowhead to see a movie we always stopped in after for a few drinks and watch a few games. Sadly they have closed the doors forever. It appears Fox and Hound has shut the doors for good on everyone of the bar/restaurants."}
{"text":"I love the Napa Valley Spinach Salad, it is out of this world! Most of the food on the menu is good. The service isn't bad. They usually have good specials or coupons. My only complaint is that it is too dark."}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow. When I go back to the pool tables, it usually takes over 15 minutes to get a drink. At best!  The managers have never come by to check on how the service was. When I ordered my food, it came out with the wrong side. I was done with my entree before she came back and I could tell her it was wrong. She then offered to get me the correct side. I didn't want it. I was done eating. Still...no manager ever came to talk to me. We have at least one problem every time. The managers need to get involved with what is going on in their restaurant. I doubt the staff even knows that they are supposed to tell the manager when there is a problem. Get it together. You have a great set up and draft selection. Make it where people want to go."}
{"text":"I think I am a fan of Fox and Hound because I know when to go for the most enjoyable experience:  Tuesday afternoons.  Why?  For a few reasons: 1.) Because on Tuesdays all drafts are only $2 a pint which is a great deal considering their draft selection.  2.) Because they have an afternoon lunch menu with some good specials.  3.) In the afternoon they are not usually very busy and therefore you won't have to wait with an empty glass.    Now that doesn't mean that I don't go at other times.  Tuesday nights the place gets packed, mostly because of the $2 drafts.  I've learned to order 2 beers at a time because the wait, whether you are at the bar or a table with waiter service, can be very long for refills.  The service has been some of the best....and some of the worst.  And I really can't pin down what the cause of bad service is because it varies from day to day and server to server.  But overall I enjoy the food (I've often dreamed of their Newcastle beer battered chicken tenders) and their beer selection is always impressive.    I'll continue to frequent Fox and Hound and recommended it as a good meeting spot (usually on a Tuesday) because overall it continues to be a good deal."}
{"text":"This use to be my spot to go to when I lived out in AZ.  A great place to meet up with friends for drinks, food, laughs and some pool.  McDuffy's is next door and I prefer this place over McDuffys.  It's a laid back place to chill-ax at.  Definitely will visit when I visit Arizona again"}
{"text":"Overall very good food, and drinks. Reasonably priced, and the waitress that we had was awesome. The only hiccup was the hostess not providing us with a menu. First time going here, and will come back. Nice to know there are still nice sports bars, with decent prices on food and drinks around. Also the flat breads are great."}
{"text":"Decent beer list, friendly service, tons of pool tables, dart boards, and shuffle board.  I've heard good things about the food; only been here for drinks.  Lots of TVs if you want to catch a game.  A little pricey on the booze, but no problems otherwise.  I would not go out of my way to come here, but my best friend lives a few blocks away, and that makes it a fine place to grab a few."}
{"text":"Great place to go shoot pool. Tables are in fantastic shape. A little pricey to play and you have to pay by the hour. Great drink specials, especially Tuesday nights and Sunday night. Service is slower than desired. Food is average bar grub. Lots of tvs and big private room for events."}
{"text":"The food here was really good- we got the Backyard burger and the Pulled pork on a really late Thursday night after driving in from Michigan. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was clean and had a good vibe. It was super hard to find though, it is tucked away in a mall complex under construction. Overall, we were very happy we ate there for the night."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to amaze me! I can't stress enough the impecable service they have at this bar! The bartenders are amazing and can accomodate my requests no matter how crazy they are. They have this drink on the menu called the Kryptonite-rita, (it's a HUGE 32oz. margarita glass, enough to share with 2-3 people.) Well I asked if I could get a Pineapple upside-down drink in this glass, and without batting an eye it was done, and boy was it loaded with the booze!   They make a killer quesaedilla with chicken and chili and the buffalo chips were spicy enough for my taste buds.  They got a new DJ too. This guy plays a great mix of Hip-hop, 80s and Top 40. It's stuff you actually want to dance to! And, unlike the other DJ they contracted a while back, you can actually hear the person next to you!  I noticed that in the Green Room there was a party or group of people playing beer pong. The place has a set up and provides the tables and party buckets of Bud Light are only $14. No I didn't play any, but it's something I will check out another Sunday.  Please give this place a try, you'll make it your new watering hole."}
{"text":"I've been working off-site at our North Hills office this week, so some co-workers and I decided to stop here for lunch.  Hooters-Meets-Bennigans-Meet-Applebees.  Boy, talk about an uninspired menu!  This is purely bar food my friends, and nearly all of it fried.  That doesn't mean the food is bad.  It's just that it's nothing you haven't seen someplace else before.   They do offer a $5.99 lunch menu which consists basically of sandwiches, burgers, and fish-n-chips.  I chose the Field of Greens salad with blackened chicken, which was pretty good.    The emphasis here seems to be their variety of beers, but since I don't drink, it's a non-factor with me.  The food here seems decent, so if you're looking for a burger-n-beer, you'll probably like this place."}
{"text":"At least the fries were tasty...service was good..food leaves alot to be desired. Now they are trying to change there whole theme up and make it a sports bar...how many sports bars are out there already..let alone I have a better \"sports\" theme in my mancave. All and all they need to make the food better..buffalo chicken sandwich was a chicken plank that was more breading then plank. Oh and get heinz ketchup..no more knock offs.."}
{"text":"Ehhh....  My review is not based on the food as we ate nothing...sorry kids.    Maybe I am just not used to the chain restaurants-turned-bars-past-7pm thing they have happening on 83rd...    I went with a friend of mine to meet up with some neighbors for a few drinks and possibly pool.  After taking 20 minutes to park  (I get it, its Saturday) we walked in and were bombarded with 'bouncers' checking out IDs as though we were at some kind of swanky night club.  We walked in, found our friends and ordered a simple glass of wine.  Then evening continued just fine but for some reason these girls kept coming around trying to see us shots all night long and would be slightly sassy when we declined their $5 cherry bombs.  Sorry...  The bartenders were entertaining, service was fine, but the shot girls need to take their sales pitch elsewhere especially after we politely declined several times.    Pros: Great people watching... Not only do all sorts of people come here, but I saw a fight and the worlds tallest woman I have ever seen!  7ft tall maybe!!  Sadly this was the highlight of my evening!"}
{"text":"I only came here when I served at two different restaurant on McKnight road.  Fox and Hound is in a really convenient location, which generates quite a bit of traffic.  The space is large, and there is indoor and outdoor space.  This is a popular bar for servers to hang out at, as well as other people, but I really do not understand why.  The food is mediocre, the service is non-existent due to being understaffed often, and the drinks I've had were over-priced.  They have some kind of loyalty club, but I never got into that.  I just think there are other and better places to frequent in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Fox & the Hound to watch an OSU basketball game.  Sat in the bar area, pretty dark and dismal, but eventually they figured out how to get the game on the big screen.  Nice TV's and plenty of seating.   Lunch was a bit pricey but not terrible.  Tried the signature turkey sandwich/club on a pretzel dough roll.   Very tasty, but add two draft beers and my bill was $15.00   didn't really think it was that steep of a bar/pub food kind of place but apparently so!  Overall, it was adequate for watching the basketball game and drinking a beer with lunch, but I doubt i'll be running back to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any sporting event. The place inside looks incredible. Downside is the drafts taste awful and its overpriced."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that this was our 2nd trip there ever.  We were there 2 years ago and the experience was horrible (food was bad, bathrooms were a mess, not enough seating for kids, etc.).  We went back because we told them of our experience and the manager there sent us a gift card to come back.  So this review is an update from then.  First of all, we sat in a booth in the dining area.  I am certain that my seat was broken (although I didn't realize it until halfway through the meal).  I was even playing with it as a man in red shirt with the restaurant name on the collared shirt (appeared as though he was a manager) was right near me and he was so focused on the Pirate game on TV he never noticed that the seat was broken or that I was playing with it.    We ordered our appetizer and the food and service was fast and our waitress was nice.  She was very prompt and we both enjoyed our food.  I had a bavarian sandwich and my wife had a salad and we had an appetizer of pretzels.  We both agreed that the food was good and enjoyable.  My only downside of the meal was that I upgraded my fries to onion rings and there were not very many onion rings.  I was a little disappointed about that and in hindsight, would stick with the fries.  As for the drinks, I had a jack and coke and my wife had a blue moon draft (16 oz I believe).  I was surprised to see that her draft (6.50) was more than my drink (5.50).  I think that is a first for me where a draft beer was more than a mixed drink.  They both tasted fine, but I know that others have commented about the prices of drinks in their reviews so I thought I would mention it and let you decide how expensive or inexpensive they are.  As for the atmosphere, please know a few things.  This is not a place for young kids.  We both decided it wasn't a bad place to go to hang out with friends but the atmosphere was geared more for a bar scene.  There were music videos playing on the screen that seemed strange and weird and we both agreed again we wouldn't want our kids to see some of the images in the videos.  There were pool tables in back rooms and again, it just seemed as though the atmosphere was more for adults.  The menu was much better from the first time we were there.  To answer the question \"Will we be back?\", I would have to say that if we do go back, it will not be with our children."}
{"text":"If you want a place to watch all of the NFL games... this isn't it. They have the Sunday Direct ticket, but dont put on all of the games because they arent paying attention. The service is poor and their draft beers sometimes taste like metal because they dont clean their lines well.  It's a shame, because the place is nice and the food is pretty good. There are much better options in the North Hills,  though. Find them.  The management at this place is clueless and not helpful."}
{"text":"It's so promising. Great specials. Awesome space. TV's everywhere. Full bar. Good food. Great place to grab some beers before and after a spring training game.  But service sucks. I don't understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service.   I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar and that's what you need to expect when you go here.  They have a very wide array of beers (some of which are pricey) and the food is bar food (ie a ton of fried food and it's certainly not gourmet).  Having said that, I enjoy going to watch a game here.  They have plenty of pool tables, darts, and more TVs than you could ever watch.  The service isn't bad and they come to check on you pretty frequently."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!!! The food sucks, the staff is slow and awful. I guess they really do not want anyone coming back.  My server overcharged my card and did not tell me but gave me the receipt for what I thought was the correct amount. I look at my statement to find the overcharged fee. This place should close permanently.  I keep wanting to be wrong, but the last few times I've been here have been worse than the time before. I waited an hour for nachos for the server to come back and tell me they were out of chicken... Close the doors and bulldoze this place."}
{"text":"It's a good mixed crowd at a bar with plenty of room to hang out. I'd prefer more single ladies to ogle but that's Peoria for ya AKA everyone is married. A few pool tables, some places to lounge, pretty cocktail servers and everyone from the local Harley riders and quad riding/hunting crowd to a few old timers and a smattering of douchebags drinks here.  Decent drink prices and the bar snacks are really good (specifically the baked pretzel sticks). The later you arrive, the more fun you will have."}
{"text":"Buy 10 get 10 wings free?  Woodchuck on tap?  BBQ/bacon/cheddar burger?   Heck yeah.  These are all of my favorite things!  While it was a bit of a hassle to get there for happy hour from the city (McKnight Road is a utter disaster at 5 pm!), I would definitely go again.  We went to watch Sid's return to the ice, and the amount of TVs left no bad spot in the restaurant.    Service was friendly and fast.  Attentive and not annoying.  She didn't seem to mind that we were sorta just there mostly for the game and were ordering kinda slow.    We got hot & honey and hot garlic wings.  I liked honey hot better, but both were good.  Woodchuck cider is pretty standard, but I always love it on tap more than the bottle.  A place that puts such importance on Woodchuck so as to give it it's own tap has a little special place in my heart.  I got the tavern burger (i.e. the BBQ/Bacon/Cheddar).  Very good, but could use more barbeque sauce.  Next time, I'd ask for a side of more sauce.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their beer/food too.    I'll remember this one for the next time I'm north of the city and want some good bar food."}
{"text":"Ok, four stars may be a bit high for first visit, but this place has great service, really tasty, greasy burgers and cheap Blue Moon... and with each one we drink, we are accruing points for more cheap stuff... woo hoo!   Try the Bacon Blue Burger w/fries ($9) ... yum! My guy liked the French Dip. Tater skins were super cheesy with lots of bacon, and much better tasting than expected.   Great service (our server was hot too lol)... never waited long for anything and never had to ask for refills.   Check out their karaoke contest - two performances left, Wed July 28th and Aug 4th, when the grand prize winner will receive $1000. Vote for my friend Julie! lol"}
{"text":"I feel like i give too many 5 star reviews, so heres a 4 star. This place rocks! Our server, named Leah, was great. We had refills before asking, cold beer, and plenty if yummy food. My only 2 complaints are-the tables are so close together, another waitress kept walking through, and I had to move every time. Also, the food is bar food. I know it is a bar, and the food was good, but there wasn't much for someone who wants healthy fare. I had a french dip, with a salad which was excellent. We will definitely be back, wearing our brown and orange--go Browns!!"}
{"text":"Wait staff is in need of training and this place generally seems confused as to what type of business they are. Front of building says \"Smokehouse and Tavern\" which would lead many to believe that it's a restaurant with a bar. The reality is that it's a sports bar that serves food and that is exactly what I got when eating there, \"Bar Food\". I ordered a blue cheese and bacon hamburger (over priced in my opinion). I explained to the waitress that I wanted the meat done just so it was a little pink in the middle and she said \"so we'll go with medium rare\" , I went along with it figuring she worked there and she would know best since I explained in detail what I wanted. Result: It came out very rare and almost raw in my opinion (just barely browned on outside and all pink everywhere else), there was barely any blue cheese to taste on it and the bottom half of my bun was soaked in grease just like I would expect from a burger at a bar.   My summary: might be a good place to get a drink and watch the game, but eat at your own risk. P.S. I saw another reviewer compliment them on the lunch menu, I went during the dinner hour."}
{"text":"The place is alright.   I have met friends here for drinks, their wings and sandwiches are pretty average, and they have an okay beer selection.      If you're here get the soft pretzels....they are bar soft pretzels, but I come here to meet up with friends and have a beer....isn't that when soft pretzels are best?"}
{"text":"We went here after a show at AZ Broadway. The waitress we had was probably *the* most brilliant waitress ever. Thats not sarcasm, I swear! She actually seperated our checks from word one. She was super attentive and nice, remembered how we all took our drinks even though the bartender didnt know how to make one of them...we had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place always smells like sewage.   Yes, that's the first thing in my review, because that's the first thing you smell when you walk in the door.   The food is fine. The beer is, fine. The only reason to go really is Tuesdays. $2 drafts. Pretty hard to beat. It seems like they have a great beer selection, but, they just, don't. I find myself staring at the beer menu not really wanting any of them. Cmon, get some real British brews!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I am disappointed. The service was slow with only ONE server for 8+ full tables. Management should be ashamed of themselves to put them through that. Food was late. Food was made wrong. I asked 4 times for sweetner for my tea before I went to take from other tables. Then the women's bathroom. I flushed the toilet in the first stall and it splashed all over the floor and my shoe. Management clean it up. You wanna charge 12+ for wings but you don't want to hire more help or fix your bathroom."}
{"text":"I had just had a small Birthday gathering for my sister there, we won this package through an email contest.  Liz who handled everything was really nice and friendly and the server we had was top notch. I don't make it over here much because I moved a bit far away but it is a great place to watch sports, play pool, drink, and eat some pretty good food."}
{"text":"This gets 5 stars for playing pool during the week, and they know how to make drinks:) the food is bar food, good bar food though."}
{"text":"Like Mar A. said, this place is full of promise: great location, big menu, wide selection of drafts... but service sucks. A friend and I went to Fox and Hound after seeing a movie at nearby Harkins Theater.  The hostesses didn't seat us, just told us to take our pick. What do they get paid for? to open the doors? (This was a running joke between my friend and I the whole night)  Our waitress must have been new on the job or very very unintelligent. My friend ordered a draft Blue Moon Hefeweisen and I requested a Blue Moon Belgian White (also on draft). She said, \"You want a Blue Moon too?\" I said \"Yes, but the Belgian White, not the Hefe. It's right there  (pointed at tap).\" Our drinks came out and... you guessed it... I got the Hefe too. Rather than complain, I just drank it.  We ordered food after a couple of beers. I asked about the hot wings, how hot they were, etc. She said they \"Weren't that hot.\" Let me let you in on a secret-- they ARE hot-- and I like really spicy food. The wings were dry, meat was scarce and the sauce was peppery and uncomfortably spicy. Add to that, my 10 piece wing order only came with 9 wings.   The waitress rarely swung by our table, when she did it was a quick \"how's everything?\" in passing.   Here's my summary: she didn't know her alcohol, she didn't check the quality (or quantity) of my food order and she generally seemed to have the attention span of a moth. Seeing as there's a TON of bars and restaurants in the area, skip Fox and Hound. It just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"A few of us checked out this place last week.  Ive always driven by it, but finally stopped in.  Damn what a great idea...   The place is divided into a few sections.. the bar/tavern/sports bar-ish area and then the dining area.  We all sat in the dining room.  There was no waiting because you can sit where you want.  The food was delicious.  They happened to have a fish fry that night and I happily enjoyed it.  It was happy hour, so we got some good deal on appetizers and drinks.  The menu was huge, so you could pick from a  huge assortment of foods.  The only thing I did question was the four hostesses standing in the front.. one was nice enough to tell us where we could sit and the others just stood there chatting with each other.    Will I be back? Oh yeah.  Loved it"}
{"text":"Great bar and hang out place. We were pleasantly surprised at the atmosphere and the service was good. The burger was good and the place just feels really comfortable."}
{"text":"Napa Salad ok but small and very little chicken.  Duplicate listing with Fox & Hound.  TV situation behind bar is not ideal (have to sit way back at tables to see the good/big TVs)."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just NEED a french dip, stat. When those times hit, check out the Fox and Hound. It's more expensive than Arby's, yes, but it's infinitely more delicious.  The drinks are over-priced but these sports bar-y restaurants always are overpriced."}
{"text":"Went here again on 3/28/2011 before heading to a movie.  So far, so good. Consistantly good burgers, drinks and service.  Won't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Fox & Hound in Peoria is a good American restaurant. They have the regular things like burgers, chicken, pasta, etc. They have a deal where you fill out a card with your birthday and email on it, and they email you a free birthday dinner once someone in your party buys another. It is a good deal and happening place on weekends. Upstairs can be reserved for extra. It has pool tables, tvs, full bar, lots of space to mingle. Good place in the West Valley."}
{"text":"i remember this place a regular stop for me and my friends years ago...  it hasn't really changed-still fairly average from the food and service. good place if you have a large group but lets hope that you get the right server, otherwise you're screwed.   one thing to be aware of....we had a VERY difficult time here due to one of my friends having an out of state license. they practically refused to let him come in saying that they don't \"accept people with our of state licenses\". wt heck?!? with the state of the economy and business, shame on them for turning away a paying patron!"}
{"text":"Listed as a Packer bar.  Went in for lunch.  Me and the wife had burgers.  Bring an appetite.  They were huge and good.  Neat place, big.  I'm sure it's alot of fun at night.  Waitresses are cute, something to stare at in between watching the game and eating."}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks?  Check. Really expensive games?  Check. Poor quality TV's?  Also check. Mediocre and overpriced food?  Check and Check."}
{"text":"Late night $7 specials are great!"}
{"text":"Wow... I was told this is a nice chilled place..... WRONG.... went her with a friend that wanted a drink and a little food after working late.  We where told is was o.k. to sit upstairs where others where at playing darts and pool (about 10 - 12 others). We sat one of the TVs to watch the end of one of the bowl games and a NBA game (good set up for that by the way), unfortunately we sat there for about 10 minutes before waving down one of the waitresses waiting on the folks already up there with the 2 other parties.  This server told us she would get someone to help since it was not her area, however after her 3rd trip up and down the stairs with drinks and food which must have been about another 10 minutes now I went downstairs to get buy some drinks and see if anyone was coming to take a food order.  Well finally got a chance to order.  BARFFFFFFFFFFF..... Bones chicken wings raw.... I MEAN raw!!!!!!!  Sauce old and not even an offer to get drinks refilled.  took food to manager and all I got was the boneless wings removed from the ticket offer..... O.K.... so this explains why service so, food bad, attitudes bad, and a bar that now seems to be a place where only heavy drinkers seem to pay for over priced drinks.  Here is the cappa when ordering the drink the bartender had to ask  my friend what was in it?????? a Pimk *&^%^? is what was ordered."}
{"text":"This is my fourth time here.  Two of the times were to just play trivia and have some adult liquid libation (ll).  One time was for some appies and ll.  Tonight we stopped in to play trivia and have a bite for dinner.  This isn't the greatest place for playing trivia as there are only two TV's - one at either side of a long bar.  So you need to be sitting at one end or the other of the bar to be able to play.  OK I have to admit that when we play trivia we always sit at the bar if there is room.  I didn't look around at the rest of the restuarant to see if there were other TV's with the game.    Our previous visits were earlier mid afternoon and I wondered how they stayed in business with few patrons.  Tonight was different.  The place was pretty packed.  It's noisy but not ear-splitting noisy.  The barpeeps were great.  Attentive and friendly. I had a grilled chicken sandwich that came california style and with fries.  Really good sandwich even if a little salty.  Fries were salty too but really tasty.  Couldn't resist chowing down on about a third of them.  I always think I will be able to resist but when they are this good it's just too hard.  I have to go with a very stong three.  Even thought the trivia layout wasn't the best, that isn't what I rate restaurants on.  The service was good, my sandwich was a cut above average, and the house chardonnay was very acceptable."}
{"text":"I dont give too many 5 stars but I was really impressed with Fox and Hound. I have been there several times and had mediocre to bad service and not very memorable food. Well that was several years ago and things are much improved!  We sat ourselves at a bar table and were quickly greeted by a hostess. Our server was Abbey and she was very friendly and full of suggestions on the menu. Becca also stopped by and gave us some suggestions on the menu.   We tried one of the Bianca flatbread and it was awesome! We also tried the Pretzel Bits appetizer and it was really good.  Nothing mind blowing here just a great atmosphere with alot of big screen tvs, pool tables, excellent service and food!   They keep the kitchen open til 2 which is frickin rad in my book!"}
{"text":"We go there twice monthly for a business network meeting (lunch bunch) and food on the lunch menu is affordable (5.99 -6.99)  fish is really good, chicken tenders, hamburgers, philly cheese steak is amazing!! and is good :) Chicken fried chicken is the bomb-as my husband says!! their arnold palmers are good too :) (tea & lemonade) Their couches are reall comfortable too AND they have FREE internet!!"}
{"text":"Staff needs a little bit more customer service training.  Was asked at the door if my husband and I were celebrating anything and I said yes little early 10 year anniversary and didn't even get a congrats or happy early anniv. Then the waitress we had seemed to be in a hurry and kind of impatient with getting our order and drinks. The water is terrible and didn't even get a lemon when asked for the first time when she took or drink order. Then we get a hamburger and well....... we asked for med/med rare and we got rare....it was so much grease/juice coming out of the burger that the bottom bun was soaked and was not able to eat it.  Small amount of blue cheese.  This is the first place that we meet on a set up blind date and needless to say we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're wanting to play pool this may be a good place.  If you're looking for service and good food pass this place up.    It was a Wednesday evening so were not talking crowded yet service was 30+ min after we placed our drink order.   The food was nothing special either."}
{"text":"Good place to meet a group, watch a game or grab a quick bite. We found this place on St. Patrick's Day after a long, frustrating day of apartment searching. No wait, quick/good/friendly service, good food and lots of good beer. I like the segmented areas and because it is so big, even when there is a huge crowd, you never feel like you have lost your personal space. Have walked over many times since and will definitely continue to."}
{"text":"their bacon is really, really good. i'd add some more reallys, but that would detract from the goodness of the bacon.   not too thick. not to thin. crisp. light and flavorful.   con - burgers/sandwiches fall apart too easily."}
{"text":"They have a beautiful dark cherry wood bar here (see pic) with tons of big TVs.  The service was good- our food was served in a timely manner and the drinks refilled many times.  However, I was a bit disappointed with the portion of fries I received- it was about 1/2 or 1/4 of what most places give you for a burger and fries.  Next time I'll just stop in for a drink and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"My fiancé had been to this restaurant about 4-5 years ago and really was anxious to go back -we *finally* went for the Pens game last Saturday. I will never be returning. When we were sitting down at a table right outside the entrance to the kitchen, said fiancé was taking his jacket off and a waitress walked into him, knocking food off of her serving tray. She waited for him to apologize and was clearly all bent out of shape (okay understandable, but her own fault), meanwhile he was standing in one spot and she ran into him.  A waitress approached our table and said she was going to be our new server (we were meeting two people there that already had drinks) and we started telling her our order when a different waitress came up to us and awkwardly informed her it was her table and she would be taking our drink orders. She then proceeded to let us know the bartender was ready to quit over a new employee. We waited far too long for drinks and my water was empty longer than it was full on more than one occasion. All four of us ordered at once and also ordered nachos for the table to share. The nachos came out with two meals and the other two meals (one of which was mine) came out 10-15 minutes later. A different server tried to serve us a different tables food and then we watch our food try to be served to a table that was clearly getting ready to leave. When the rest of the food did come, my dinner (chicken tenders) was burned and I was told it just looks dark because there's a dark beer in the batter. Nevermind that they also TASTED burned. Anyways, the food was mediocre and looked better than it tasted but what really caused 2 stars was the atrocious serving staff. Do yourself a favor and go to any other restaurant on McKnight."}
{"text":"In the end there is nothing wrong with Fox & Hound.  The food is pretty decent, along with the service. Although occasionally you will get that waitress who seems annoyed that she actually has to work but that is few and far between and really, you could get that at any place out there.  This place is probably one of the best in town for large groups as they have a few private areas and can accommodate for just about anything you throw at them. If your into UFC, they are always doing special events for that as well.  My biggest gripe with F&H is their tv set up. Yes they have a ton of tv's and you really can't find a seat in the house where one isn't in easy view. But... the system that runs the tvs sucks, if your watching any tv in the main room other then the main one over the bar, there is a 1-2 second delay in everything you see. So you'll hear something happen behind you and then  you see it. Totally ruins the experience of watching games on TV there. Note that this issue doesn't occur in the side rooms, only the main area.  But back to positives, the drinks are good, the crowd is usually pretty entertaining and the prices aren't that bad. But if your a die hard sports fan, either get a good seat, or head over to BWW and Padre Murphy's to watch the game."}
{"text":"Visiting my son and daughter in law for the Christmas Holiday. My wife and I arrived early Saturday morning Christmas eve day. Broncos were playing against Buffalo Bills and since it wasn't being aired at his place. Decided to go to Fox and Hound to watch the game.  Haven't been to a sports bar in years, and didn't even know that Fox & Hound (F&H) was a sports bar. Anyhow, pleasantly surprised, F&H is more upscaled and accommodating then expected. Our grandson came along , 9.5 months old. a little bit of babysitting duty, The patrons and the servers were very easy going and didn't appear to mind that we brought him into F&H.  About and hour into the gaming atmosphere, our daughter in law picked up our grandson and took him home to nap, or have his own little huddle.   Being Sunday football, they have various rooms with huge TVs for your viewing pleasure and separated out to various team rooms so you can watch your favorite team with fellow fans.  Our room included a good natured Buffalo Bill cheer fan who hooped and hollered every-time the Bill's out maneuvered the Broncos.  It was fun, our room enjoyed the game, even though Broncos lost.   The food and drink was better then expected, Our server, Kendra did a wonderful job and made sure we had enough to drink and eat and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. we were there for about 3 hours, and never once did I feel rushed or pressured into leaving or having to constantly order something.  We had: Coors and soda for drinks. Food:    Play Action Platter: Your typical chicken wings,potato skins, mozzarella sticks- including Bavarian style pretzels and of course 3 different dipping sauces with this platter.  A nice little touch is when you order this platter, a portion of the proceeds is donated to St Jude childrens research hospital.  The deluxe cheese pizza with pepperoni - thin crust, crisp, marinara sauce, and enough mozzarella melted on it to create string bridges from the slice to your mouth as you bite into the slice and pull away.   Ten Pack Bavarian Pretzels: Looked good and tasty with a pint of beer to help wash it down.   Cobb Salad: refreshing with their cider cobb dressing.  Should have asked for more dressing. I like a lot of dressing on my salads.  This was a good way to end the food after all the fried foods and carbohydrates we ate.  They also serve burgers, sandwiches and full entrees.  The prices seem reasonable, there was a total of 5 adults, with only 3 adults in my party from beginning to end of game and the bill with tax and excluding tip came to about $83.  2 of the adults didn't eat or drink much and had to leave early.  This is a place I can see going to time and again to enjoy sporting events, have a few drinks, food and be with like minded fans.  I will have to go to other F&H to see if it's the same atmosphere and climate"}
{"text":"The food was good.  It was a cool atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon.  My wife and I both had one of their burgers and they were both delicious.  This place did not disappoint.  I am curious to see what it is like during football season."}
{"text":"Never again!  The management team was just sitting at a table as a few bar tenders struggled with long lines and continues tap problems. This review is for poor management leading to poor service. No offense to the bar or server staff."}
{"text":"Fairly average place with a decent tap selection and appetizers.  Happy hour isn't bad but could be better, and I'd rather hit this spot than McDuffy's just south of here if given the choice.  Parking isn't bad now that El Toro Bravo went out of business (shared parking lot).  Krispy Kreme next door doesn't seem to have so many patrons late at night."}
{"text":"They have Ace on tap. Thats good enough for me. Fortunately I also dig the food. We usually get the play platter (soft pretzels, wings, mozzerella sticks and onion petals) and the french dips. The bartenders are friendly but it can be difficult to get a waitress's attention - they are busy primping and flirting with the management - so take a seat at the bar if you go."}
