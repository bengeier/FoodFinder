{"text":"Great little place to celebrate a birthday. Really recommend the esfiha.  Made in house and really good. Had the spinach and zucchini and beef.  Tasty."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good....
For a long time me and my girlfriend were looking after Brazilian restaurants which could provide some of the treats we so missed from home with quality and authenticity.
The esfihas and açaí were specially two of them. Very well done!
The food was great, the price is fair and the place is very cozy and cute.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Quite simply, one of downtown's best hidden gems. The food is fantastic, the service awesome, the beer cheap, the attitude always casual. Great date spot. Live music once a week, although I forget which day. You can have a great cheap night here, or go all out, but either way you gotta try the picanha!"}
{"text":"I spent 4 weeks in Brazil and never had anything like the food served here. The waitress is really nice and the place is reasonable nice. We had dinner within the last week and I can say that the food provided was nothing remotely Brazilian, everything we had was deep fried and extremely salty. The tap beer is not recommended.We went to this place from the reviews on Yelp but these review are misguiding. Sorry about the bad review"}
{"text":"As a fan of many things Brazilian, I had to try Braz.1.L. We discovered this place last year and loved the fact that they offered customers board games on certain nights. The location is also very convenient as the restaurant sits cozy on Maitland, just a few steps off Yonge Street.

First impressions...
----
Low key, small with a good-sized patio. Will this be my new hangout spot on summer nights? We were warmly welcomed by the staff.


Food...
----
Esfihas at 99cents a pop? Are you kidding me? These are rock bottom prices, and they taste amazing! Try one. Or maybe four. My favourite is the lean ground beef one.

The real bait at this place were the Caipirinha. To clarify, Caipirinhas are \"Brazil's national cocktail\", easily made with cachaça (sugar cane hard liquor), sugar and lime. My boyfriend once brought back a bottle of Cachaça gifted to him by a farmer in Brazil... How much more authentic does it get? We attempted to concoct authentic Caiprinhas ourselves. The result was delicious and thus we decided that we must seek out more Caipirinha serving places in the dot. Mission accomplished, because on Wed nights they're going for $4.99 at this joint.


Service...
----
True to Brazilian culture, the staff were super-duper friendly each of the three times I visited. Every time,  I feel like I am an old friend visiting-- and I don't even know the staff well! That's how nice they are. Drinks rolled out pretty fast. But the food took a little while to come out (20+min). Hopefully the reason being is that they were ultra-fresh.


Walked away thinking...

\"Should've tried the pão de queijo! (cheesy puffs)\" and already planning my next visit back."}
{"text":"High quality food and service for a great price. Came by here with friends and had a great experience. None of us were familiar with anything other than Brazilian steakhouse and our server took us through everything on the menu in a non-pedantic way (increasingly a rarity when dining out). 

We had a variety of esfihas (mini Brazilian \"pizzas\"). Cheeseburger, sausage, and zucchini were the favourites although the cheese and spinach were nice too. The dough was incredibly light and delicious... Almost croissant-like. Also got the cassava wedges, pao de quiejo (cheese stuffed for 50 cents extra -- you're a fool if you don't do so), and the pound of beef. Of course we had to get caipirinhas to wash it all down. We tried both lime and strawberry--lime's the winner as the strawberry was too sweet and boozy tasting with no citrus to balance it out. Between 6 of us, we ordered a ton of food and two rounds of drinks -- came out to about $40/person (including tax and tip), which is a steal in this city. 

As mentioned before, service was wonderful. We sat on the patio, which was small but nice. Can see how sitting inside might not be as fun. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great place and environment. The servers are very welcoming and the food is amazing! 
I'm definitely coming back more often!!"}
{"text":"Nelson and staff are amazing, you honestly feel like family. The authentic Brazilian food is fantastic. You will never eat Picanha steak and white rice as delicious as here! Please visit this fabulous restaurant and support this local gem!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Rafaela our server was amazing ... The little coxinhas(5 of them) were the best we had in Toronto so far. Small crunchy and tasty. The the esfihas ... Oh boy oh boy. My wife and I ate 2 chicken with catupiry and one lean ground meat ...
They also have beer on tap which is great. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've seen a few restaurants/bars leave that location, so I wasn't expecting much when I saw a new restaurant there. However, it was a nice surprise to go to a simple but nice restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the food is very tasty and fresh!

While they're still sorting out some details, I've really enjoyed going there and drinking their caipirinhas :)
**tip: go on Wednesday, caipirinhas are almost 1/2 price and quality seems to be the same.

I hope these guys stay in business for a long time!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with genuine Brazilian food. My favorite plate is the Trivial. A steak of juicy picanha with rice and beans and cassava flour."}
{"text":"Wow, somehow between the seedy shops of Yonge street and the \"unce, unce, unce\" of the bass thumping at the gay bars on Church, a magical Brazilian restaurant has opened.  

Brazil Esfiha House is a new Brazilian place that specializes in Esfihas?  What's an Esfiha you ask?  
It's a small Brazilian pizza that's inspired by Lebanese and other middle eastern cuisine.  They have about 10 different types on the menu ranging in price from $1 for the ground beef one (one of my favorites) to more like $2 for the sausage and cheese one (also one of my favorites).  They have a few vegetarian ones thrown in the mix as well.  The crust is delightfully crunchy on the outside and smooth on the inside.  I warn you these things are addictive.

They also have a variety of other items on the menu that are typically brazilian/middle-eastern including Kibbe (which are delicious ground beef and dough balls that are then fried).  They also have Bacalao (which is fried cod balls).  The kibbe were delicious.  The bacalao, while tasty, were just a bit over-salted for me.  

Oh, and lest I forget, they have CAPIRINHAS.  These delightful brasilian cocktails are made with Cachaca (a cousin of rum), sugar, and limes muddled together.  They also have a few additional flavors depending on the night.  Wednesday, though, is the magical night when capirinhas are only $4.99...what a deal!

The patio is great, although in the winter, the interior is going to be a bit cozy.  The service, while super friendly, tends to run on the slow side.  I think this is largely just growing pains as they've only been open a few weeks.  

For now, obrigado for the good food."}
{"text":"As a brazilian living in toronto. I was very excited when I read the menu. Its all there. The super traditional brazilian dishes drinks and pop. They have some of my favourate treats growing up. I was happy to stop by."}
{"text":"My favorite food on the planet is acai bowl.  I had it in Brazil and have scoured the city (or anywhere else for that matter) for it to no avail.  Finally I have found it!!  They have acai bowl here and it is identical to what I fell in love with on the streets of Rio.  You can even take a bucket of it to go which doesn't go hard in the freezer.  Aside from having amazing health benefits, it tastes incredible and gives you energy like few things I have ever eaten.

As the name suggests they also specialize in esfiha - tiny, amazing pizzas that range from simple cheese to desert versions.   Wednesdays are caipirinha nights and over all, everything on the menu is genuinely Brazillian.  The space is small and informal but the owner is incredibly inviting and an amazing guy.  I love this place!"}
