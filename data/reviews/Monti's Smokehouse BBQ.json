{"text":"We had the Monti sandwich and the Tupac fries. Awesome flavors and a great value. Definitely worth seeking out when you're looking for your next BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem at First Friday and it took everything in me to not buy everything on the menu. The awesome thing about these guys is they're popping up in so many places: courthouse, dispensaries, first Friday. Plus the owners are so friendly! Definitely recommend if you see them out"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Monti's Smokehouse BBQ. More specifically, let me tell you about this salad they made me. I know what you're thinking... \"Seriously? Salad at a BBQ place?\". You'd be right to think that, but I'm trying to be less of a fat bastard. It's going *OKAY*.  Alright, back to the salad. Arugula, pickled stuff (I'm not exactly sober while trying to type this), feta cheese, and most importantly smoked meat. Real talk; I've eaten a lot of BBQ in my day (see: fat bastard) and I can tell you that Monti's is up there on a whole other level. This shit is serious."}
{"text":"Just finished the most amazing Mac and cheese with a side of bbq pulled pork from Monti's. Kelcie and Ryan were running the truck and couldn't have been more personable and hilarious! They even threw in some homemade guacamole and chips(my co workers are demolishing it as I type).  The smoke flavor on the pork was about as good as it can get.  They have a variety of tasty sandwiches, even vegan options. If you see this truck, do your taste buds a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Super yummy and super friendly! We got the Charlie and it was so good! We finished it in 2 minutes flat it was so delicious.   We met Kelcie (one of the owners) and she was so kind, so sweet, and really attentive.   Go here!"}
{"text":"There at my work and just wow.  The smell of the smoked wood is spectacular alone!!! Looking at the menu and the food items are to die for.  Must see food truck!"}
{"text":"the freaking tupac is amazing!!!!!!!!!!  round 2 and im going to keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"Super!!! This food truck and its team owners make the best BBQ sandwiches!!! Glen and family"}
{"text":"hands down the best bbq , the best grilled cheese sandwich....the best food ever and not mention you get your food in a timely fashion!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously so amazing!!! My sister and I saw them at the great American foodie fest and not only did they have the best looking food truck... they also had the best smelling food truck and I was solddd!!! We got the biggie fries and Abby's tacos!! Soooo delicious you won't be disappointed! The people that own this truck are so awesome and personable too. I love supporting amazing businesses and the food is sooooo amazing."}
{"text":"Finally a sandwich truck that got it right all the way! Their Cuban is called the monti, highly recommend the meat flavor sandwich. Five stars!!!! Boom!$;-)"}
{"text":"Just really good food made by a couple of cool people! Its always a pleasant surprise to show up at an event that they are at!"}
{"text":"Great quality food, everything tastes fresh and home made. I got the grille cheese sandwich with pulled pork and was legit. My wife got the tacos with the jerk chicken and they were amazing. We will go back !"}
{"text":"I recently had my bachelorette party and my bridesmaids surprised me with this wonderful food truck at my party. They were so amazing and made my special day that much better. Their food is wonderful and can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this food truck!!!! Not only are the owners amazing but so is their food. If you're looking for an amazing twist to carne asada fries.. you have to try the Tupac. SO GOOOOOOD!"}
{"text":"When the blue truck pulled up at TELUS, I was intrigued.  It was something new!  Then I saw The Dude, Duderino, adorning the back of the truck and I knew I had to stop in for a bite.  Fantastic!  BBQ trucks are my weakness.  I ordered the bomb Mac'n'cheese and added some pulled pork.  I could have dropped 3 of these down in one shot, it was SO good.  The meat was soft and tender, the cheese not overdone, a good breadcrumb crust covering the cheeses pasta shells, and a damn good bbq sauce.  The people were awesome, the food was fantastic, and for any fan of Lebowski, it's the coolest truck you've ever seen!  It's barbecue, dude!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! You can tell they're passionate about food!! If you're looking for something with that authentic Smokey vinegary sweet taste then this is your place!!! Great melding of flavors! The chef is very cool and the young lady taking orders is very helpful and drops plenty of knowledge about the menu. Do yourself a favor and try them!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bbq! They have some of the best bbq sandwiches I have ever had! Almost everything is made from scratch, and it shows in the flavor. I highly recommend the hot link sandwich or the Tupoc loaded fries. The prices are very reasonable for the size of the portions and the quality of the food. The owners are also extremely nice, and bend over backwards to make sure customers are happy. Also, the homemade pickles are very delicious, and highly recommended. If you see them around, stop by and treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese EVER! Jerk chicken on point as well! My new favorite bbq spot! Gave a suggestion about serving mac and cheese and they totally made the change. (They were using paper and i suggested something else so we could enjoy all of the cheesy goodness! Now they use foil and its much better!) Glad to know that suggestions of patrons are taken seriously."}
{"text":"So I stopped off at this car show randomly, and while the cars were mediocre, the food off this food truck was amazing. I had the Jeff & The Mac n' Cheese. I was full about 3/4 the way through, but It was so good I had to finish. They had a kids meal and everything was reasonably priced for such good grub. Find them and try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"This place comes to my work once a month and let me tell you they are so good and the nicest people ! Everything is worth the try bc it's all amazing !"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the people are always very friendly. The food truck comes up to my job about once a week. If you like BBQ, I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This truck is absolutely amazing and the owners are extremely nice. They make nearly everything from scratch all the way down to the sauces and even the pickles! I myself am a pickle snob and theirs made me want more. They use \"Grandma B's\" recipe and whoever that is kudos to you! In addition to that they contribute 25% of pickle sales to Second Chance Animal Rescue. Being an animal lover makes me like them even more. Plus the truck is named after one of their animals and all of the items are too!  When you find them get either the Lucy Sandwich: tri-tip, Swiss cheese, pickled red onions, arugula and chimichurri on some delicious baguette.  Or The Monti Cubano: pulled pork, pork loin, grandmas pickles, Swiss cheese, mustard and once again that delicious baguette. Except this one is a pressed the sandwich. Add bbq fries or the best Mac n' Cheese I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The Monti sandwich is my favorite. One of the best food trucks out there!"}
{"text":"Listen I must tell you the owners are wonderful personality out of this world and they are so chill and down to earth!!! Great sense of humor and overall hands down my introduction to them was so bomb!!! Then to top it off the FOOD!!!! Amazing!!!!  Listen I bullshit you not!!! Everything was great!! The Monti was dancing in my mouth!!! The flavors just burst in your mouth. They pulled up to my job and showed their wonderful asses today!!! The homemade Guacamole and fresh chips  no need to say more you can't go wrong with nothing on the menu!!! You get your money's worth for sure!! With great service and the a smile...."}
{"text":"First of all the menu visually is just so appealing you need time to read through and visualize each item. Come hungry because your gonna wanna try more than one entree like me! Ha I decided on the Fritz which is a truck made hot link, Texas toast, pickles, mustard, and perfect amount of barbecue sauce . And this barbecue sauce is really something it's smooth and yet has that subtlety of sweet but spicy in perfect balance. The link will not disappoint but is so flavorful and juicy and smoked perfect. The Texas toast was grilled perfect and I just couldn't believe every bite was the perfect bite literally. Definitely recommend this . Next I tried the loaded fries they have two options the Tupac and the Biggie even tho normally I'd choose West Coast lol I had to go with the Biggie which is fries, baked beans, pulled pork, coleslaw and sauce. Now this one appealed to me because of the pulled pork and coleslaw but the fries are just perfect not skinny not super thick just right, crisp and seasoned just right! the pulled pork was portioned our bite size and throughout and it was soft and juicy, the coleslaw was heaven it didn't have a bunch of mayo or dressing but instead was bright and colorful full of crunch I didn't even feel guilty about eating French fries! The only thing for next time I will order easy sauce since the beans already have a flavoring on them and they ARE good beans so yeah maybe even no bbq sauce on mine. All and all I had to give this food 5 stars just my whole experience and the owners are very down to earth and professional they are true foodies that apparently did the whole culinary school thing and worked as a chef etc etc well just saying because you see so many food trucks opening up but it's nice to know your getting a lot of love served up in every order with Monti's BBQ and I will look for them out there"}
{"text":"This food truck was so good. $9 lunch combo for pulled pork and fries that was seriously better than other restau style bbq here in town. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The portions are good and the food is flavorful! This food truck came to job and gave me great service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I work at Liquor World (Cactus) and we host \"Food Trucks\" every Saturday night...  A young lady named \"Kelsey\" came into our store and said she was running the BBQ truck named \"Monti's\" and invited me to try it...  I tried it and had the \"Jeff\" (\"Pulled Pork and Jalapenos\", etc.)...  All I can say is: \"WOW\"!  Incredible!  Really \"Hit the Spot\"!  \"Great Food\", \"Good Prices\" and \"Fantastic Host (Kelsey)\"...  Great personality and wonderful smile...  I \"Highly Recommend\" trying them...  They are all about customer service and helping out dogs and dog shelters...  Definitely worth your time and helping out a \"Good Cause\"... Mike (The Bourbon and Beer Guy at Liquor World Cactus)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing! These fries are the best damn fries I've ever put in my mouth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! These guys are cranking out some really good bbq!"}
{"text":"Stuck at the courthouse for jury duty, was pulled in by the smells and the pic of the Dude on the back. Had the pork and coleslaw sandwich - amazing flavor with a little bit of heat. Got a homemade pickle that was fantasticly garlicky and gets a donation to a dog rescue! Cool people and damn good food, almost made jury duty bearable."}
{"text":"The food tastes great! I'm happy my job has them onsite! I like the music choices on the truck as well!"}
{"text":"See I was going to apologize for my harsh review....Well never mind. These people clearly have a problem with anyone having an opinion about their food that isn't great. I never asked for a refund. I only wanted them to know that it could have been better. I've received two replies from the owners/management and they seem angry. I don't criticize, I state facts. Just like every one else I post my experience with the food that I buy. So I'll stay with my 1 star rating and I won't ever patronize their business again. And btw I didn't have jury duty, so find something else to be sarcastic about."}
{"text":"Do u have an email for this food truck it sounds good."}
{"text":"Best pickles in the city hands down. Their Mac and cheese is awesome. I ran into these guys and they are friendly and love what they do, which shows in their food. The whole menu is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Try the Monti. It's their take on a Cuban. It's amazing. The wife had the Lucy and loved it as well. Plus the folks in the truck are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is Bomb! I am from Ga. and this is the best BBQ I have had in LasVegas.  I had a Grilled cheese pork sandwich on Texas toast and loaded fries called the Biggie....So good!!!!"}
