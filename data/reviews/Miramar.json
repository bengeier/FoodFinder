{"text":"Great food. You find the best Latin food in the small little restaurants. That's what this is, nothing fancy, but amazing food! If you like Latin food, you won't regret coming here. Their yuca frita, churrasco, tilapia, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I had a nice light lunch of beef tacos. The ingredients were quality and very fresh. Nice family run business. I guarantee you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Just opened a month or so, a cozy little restaurant with very friend service-- run by a family.  The carne asada was top notch.  I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I'd been to Tazumel before and after a few attempts to call, I drove by and found out it had changed to Miramar.  Miramar has now been open for 1 and a half weeks and I actually see this as a very welcome change!  Few changes have been made to the dining area, but it seems brighter and more welcoming somehow.  The owner is friendly and her family helps make all the food.  I saw them hand patting out the tamales together as we sat and watched/listened to Selena on repeat.    Being with a group of about 10 people, we were able to order a wide selection of food.  Pupusas, Tamales, Chicharonnes, Plantains, Whole Fish, Carne Asada, etc.  It was all delicious and we left VERY full!    Service was excellent, especially for a large group.  It took a little while to get the check, but I think they were trying to give us time to catch up and enjoy our food, so I don't see that as a real issue.    Absolutely worth a try - they have take-out too!"}
