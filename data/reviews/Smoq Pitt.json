{"text":"Yeah, about as great BBQ as you are going to find, not just in PGH -- anywhere.  That is what happens when low and slooooowwwwww meets up with the right hardwoods, rubs and sauces. Check out the prices. Double for this high quality in most towns. The sides are solid. Plate or sandwich: beautiful. The chicken is spot on. And the chicken wings are a nuts bargain, so big and meaty. Took a long time for Pittsburgh to get some swell barbeque, but this guy Mitch from Rockwell, IL brought it on home."}
{"text":"On 7/7/2015 - had 1/2 rack ribs and onion rings and wife had wings and mac & cheese. We both think the food should have 4 stars - maybe wife thinks 5 stars. I think that greens (collards,kale,beet,swiss chard-any green) should be added to the menu. Also tried to turn the owner on to to pig wings (not known in Pittsburgh or at least to many)  Owners response was very dismissive and this item could fit into the POV of a Q joint nicely IMHO."}
{"text":"Overall it was very good. Ordered half rack with baked beans and mac & cheese.  I liked their sauces as well. Place is small, but they were doing a lot of take out. Staff was friendly. Food came out fast. Give them a try."}
{"text":"OMG the ribs tasted like hotdogs.. Chicken was dry... Brisket was soggy... Do not recommend"}
{"text":"I saw them at Eat.Drink.Pittsburgh last weekend. They had the best food there... pulled pork sandwiches were great They added some vinegar which was surprisingly good. I will be trying this myself. The pork belly sliders were cooked to perfection. The fat was just perfectly crisp. Their brisket could have stayed in the smoker for a few more hours. It wasn't quite as tender as I like but tasted great. I chalked that up to having to prepare for the event and the mass quantities needed.  Their sides were good also. Cornbread, mac n cheese, slaw... all top notch.  I only tried their tangy sauce. It was good. Next time, I'm going to see if they have anything with more heat.  Smoq Pit may be the best BBQ in the city so far. I don't go out for BBQ much because I prefer to smoke my own pork, ribs, brisket, etc at home. Next time I need a quick fix, I'm headed to the Smoq Pit."}
{"text":"I can't understand how other people could like this place. I ordered 1/2 of a slab of St. Louis ribs and a side of baked beans. The ribs were so smoky that they were bitter and extremely tough. The baked beans were mediocre at best. Ribs require patience to cook properly and smoke should be used as a seasoning like salt. Whomever prepared this food is quite heavy handed with the hickory.  The girl at the counter was nice and very friendly so I gave them 2 stars instead of 1"}
{"text":"Just awful. Ordered takeout. Half rack of baby back ribs and pulled pork sandwich. Both tasted like I was eating a camp fire... I'm not exaggerating. The only flavor was extremely intense smoke. The temperature of both was barely warm. I understand it was takeout but I only live 5 minutes away.  Luckily I had sauce at home because they forgot to give me sauce. The ribs were extremely tough and had very little flavor besides burnt wood. Both the ribs and pulled pork sandwich were thrown out after a few bites. Easily one of the worst meals I've ever had. I can't possibly recommend this place any less.  This is my first review and probably my last but I was blown away by the disappointment and had to rant."}
{"text":"A friend told us about this place the other day so we decided to try it- we got the 4 meat combo (which is an awesome deal because you get a TON of food). The ribs ( St. Louis and baby back) were phenomenal - super tender and full of great smoky flavor. The pulled pork was also delicious!   I wasn't a big fan of the sauces but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on Tuesday.. My kids ordered chicken fries and corn bread they both ate their food which is always a good sign... My husband had the St. Louis style ribs, fries, Mac and cheese and corn bread and I had the beef ribs, slaw and cornbread.. Everything was really good. Portions were big, the staff were friendly and we didn't wait long at all.. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because we were a little dissapointed with the Mac and cheese it we absolutely loved everything else...Don't forget to order a S'mores pie mmmm so good!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork and brisket were great (& the cornbread). The prices were decent (25 or so for 2 people). The staff was super friendly (made conversation). I'm glad to have them on the Boulevard and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time visit and we'll be back! The owner was behind the counter which impressed me. He made great suggestions on what to order. Everything we had was excellent. The chicken, brisket, and baby back ribs were all sooo tender. All the meat came dry rubbed with yummy sauces. The tangy was mustardy and good with the chicken, but it was super flavorful on its own. The sides were good too - paprika-seasoned, not-heavy mac & cheese and balsamic saut√©ed veggies (daily special).   Also, even though we got takeout, we noticed that it was BYOB and learned there was no corkage fee! This is a perfect place for takeout, but we might have to take advantage of that next time. :)"}
{"text":"We visited Smoq Pitt for our monthly dinner club after driving down Brookline Blvd. several times and wondering where the great smells were coming from!  It's not a big place but definitely worth checking out. The menu is not big but we agonized over what to get because we wanted to try everything!  I went with the 2 meats and 2 sides - pulled pork and brisket with mac and cheese and vegetables.  The portion sizes on the meats were really good and the different sauces (sweet, spicy, tangy) were all very good and you can use as much as you want.   Some people in our party got wings, which were the full wing and huge.  All off the food was extremely fresh and hot and the service was very good.  Another bonus: they are BYOB.    Great food, very reasonably priced, great service, great place!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best ribs in pittsburgh. I come here about once a week, and they have been consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Soooooo freaking delicious!!! Do yourself a favor and eat here ASAP! We shared the 3 meat combo; st louis ribs, sliced brisket and pulled pork with two sides... it was more than enough to stuff us! The ribs were to die for! Homemade sauces, moist cornbread and good prices! This gal is a happy yelper!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for about 3 months and is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh barbecue scene.  The atmosphere is Western with lots of wood and old rusty memorabilia decorating the walls, a perfect ambiance for barbecue.  I stopped in here the other day and ordered a sampling of four meats and two sides.  It was a hot day and we were offered complimentary bottled water, which as very nice of them.  Meats: As far as the barbecue goes, the pulled pork was phenomenal, though does come pre-sauced.  The chicken and ribs were also very good.  The brisket was OK, but not as good as I was hoping for.  I appreciated that they offered sliced brisket, whereas other joints in the area only offer chopped brisket.  Still, I was hoping for a little more moisture and robust flavor in the brisket.    Sides: The mac and cheese was a little gritty with not all the cheese fully melted.  I was not a fan at all of the baked beans as they were covered in thick sauce, cooked to be very mushy, and there was no variety at all in the beans, just small what appeared to be pinto beans (In stark contrast to Pittsburgh Barbecue Company which has amazing baked beans).    Sauces: There are three sauces on the table.  None of them taste much likely any sort of typical barbecue sauce.  Either they are missing the liquid smoke, or paprika, or ground pepepr, or something because most tasted like some sort of flavored salad dressing rather than barbecue sauce.  I appreciated different styles of barbecue sauce from various regions, including vinegar based or mustard based sauces but the offerings here didn't really match up with anything I'm accustomed to.  The portion sizes were huge and definitely good value for the prices charged, which I would say are average to a little less than average as far as barbecue goes.  I'll come back and give them another try sometime as they are relatively new and Mitch was a very nice guy.  Hopefully the beans and sauces will improve."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised. All meat is grass fed and hormone free. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Small dining area, clean and tidy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Friday at about 6:30pm and places a to go order.  There was a couple in front of us and we walked up to the counter and stood for about 10 minutes and no one uttered a word or acknowledgement to us of any kind.  Finally I interrupted a girl that was busy looking very confused doing nothing but watching another girl work.  I asked if I could place an order?  Which after a few more minutes she finally took our order.   She had us repeat our order multiple times because she was so confused on getting it entered into the I pad.  Then she said it would be about 20 minutes.  We paid and waited 20 minutes.  We went back in and she looked very confused and stressed and said it would be at least another 10-15 minutes.  We are here right now still waiting. No matter how good the food is we will not be back."}
{"text":"If I could pick a negative star, I would!  To start off, the service was horrible. We called at 5:30PM to place a take out order. The pulled pork would not be ready until 6-630 because of the mad rush at lunch time. We were fine with this and got to the place at 6:20PM. Granted we were early, the pulled pork was still not done.  We also order beef brisket.  So, I would think that would be packed and put aside until the pork is done.  Well, that makes too much sense.  It is now 6:50Pm and the pork is now done, but wait,  now they are out of brisket, even though they served individual brisket meals. So now we must wait for brisket!  After makin a fuss about how this was all done, we finally get our food, and refunded for the brisket, we get the food home to our guests who have been waiting patiently. It was the worse tasting food ever!  The brisket was rubbery, chewy and tasteless.  The pulled porked was less than pulled and I'm sure canned pork would have been better.  I will not be revisiting this place and if you're smart, you will stay away!  Smoqless and tasteless pit is wait it should be called."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because of all the good press it has received lately. We ordered pulled pork, baby back ribs, green beans, Mac and cheese, and corn bread. Everything was OK-nothing great except the corn bread-that was the best corn bread I have ever had. The pulled pork was a little too salty, the ribs had great flavor but were really dry and tough, the green beans were good, and the Mac and cheese was pretty basic and flavorless. They have a sweet, spicy, and tangy sauce on the table for you to use. I wasn't crazy about any of them by themselves but i mixed the sweet and spicy together and that was great. I did take a taste of my friend's brisket which was by far the best taste of food I had there. Overall, it was an OK experience."}
{"text":"Just... Okay. They deliver and that's the saving grace for me. The chicken was dry, the macnchz abysmal, bland with a weird spice to it. Did not care for either the tangy or sweet sauces."}
{"text":"Always trying new local spots and avoiding chains we decided to give Smoq a try. We placed a large order at work for delivery and almost 2 hours later (4miles away)  when it arrived all the 8 of us who ordered could say is Wow! This is Horrible!!! Everything dry and burnt except the wings that were 1 not smoked, and 2 were undercooked ..  I will say the Sauces were good but the meats were horrible, burnt, dry, just nasty.. Do not recommend ! We threw away more than we ate .. Drive another 5 min and go to Pittsburgh BBQ! You will thank me !"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork! Huge portions. The mac n cheese is pretty good too. Highly recommend trying them for lunch. Pricing is ok. Once you try it, the price feels a little better."}
{"text":"AMAZING BAR BQ!! I had baby back ribs, Mac & cheese, & green beans. Hubbie got the pulled pork, cornbread, & cole slaw. Everything so delicious we have nothing left to photograph!!! Great music playing, great service too!"}
{"text":"Smoq has the best smoked beef brisket bbq we have found in Pittsburgh.  The flavor was excellent, and the slices had a good balance and variation of leanness (wet and dry beef).  Having lived in Texas for 25 years, I guarantee this sliced brisket would do very well in Houston, Austin or anywhere in Texas.    The three available bbq sauces are tangy with a mustard flavor, sweet and spicy.  We have eaten here twice now, and for me mixing the sweet and spicy sauces works great.  The cornbread is excellent.  It comes jalapeno or regular.  Next time I may make my two sides cornbread and cornbread.  It is made as muffins, so every piece has both the nicely-textured edge and the warm, soft center.  Cooked corn kernels add to the nice texture and taste.  The cole slaw was better than most.  It was light without a heavy mayo base like slaw has in some places.  The baked beans were average and the mac and cheese just above average in taste, but who cares when the smoked brisket is this good!!!  In some Pittsburgh restaurants, bbq brisket is not available until after 5:00.  At Smoq, you can have smoked brisket for lunch or dinner!  Smoq is a small, very informal hole in the wall sort of place right in the heart of Brookline.  The service was very friendly, prompt and competent.  I will go back, I will tell friends, and I plan to use takeout to make this outstanding bbq the theme of a party."}
{"text":"Not enjoyable at all. ribs were super tough and had a horrible flavor. None of the sauces the provided were good. The spicy had no spice, the sweet was ridiculously sweet and the tangy was tasteless."}
{"text":"I'm staying at an Airbnb nearby and they recommended this place to me. Having grown up in Texas I was really reluctant to try BBQ in PA. To me BBQ is always best in Texas. Well, being in the mood for some brisket I decided to give this place a go. The brisket was very moist and delicious. I had a beef rib and it was to die for. Cleaned it off to the bone. I had the coleslaw and it was good but not great. It was vinegar based. The baked beans were okay and really not close to what I think of when it comes to baked beans.  They were almost like a sweet and spicy bean soup. I'd give them a 5, coleslaw a 6 and the meat was a 10. The sauces were delicious when I combined them all to make something that was both sweet and spicy. Staff was good and attentive. They place was nicely decorated and clean. Try this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"The sweet smell of bbq lured me into this place. We were hitting the post office and then heading home to eat lunch. It was hook line and sinker. I'm really picky about my bbq because I don't like fatty textures which are typically food in ribs and pulled pork. This place food was delicious and new had to bbq it up! Ordered the pulled pork with tangy sauce, mac&cheese, and yams.  My 1.5 daughter (who hardly ever eats meat) loves the tender juicy meat. Lunch was a huge success here! So happy we stopped! Lunch meal was only $12 and fees both my daughter and I, plus some left overs. Def going back!"}
{"text":"Babyback ribs are dynamite, as are their array of sauces. Pulled pork is really good.  Sides are very average, as is the fried chicken. Actually, with the fried chicken they have gone with jumbo size wings, but the truth is smaller pieces of chicken cook better 9/10 times. Such was the case here in our experience.   Ambiance is great, although if you stay there a while you will smell like some smoked cedar when you leave lol. I like the place, and would definitely go back for the ribs. But you can't be 4 stars without great sides, IMO."}
{"text":"Yesterday my fiance and I decided to order some take out from this place while we were on our way home from the store. We had wedding projects to do, so we just ordered some take out. The ONLY reason I would give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the order online feature on their website wasn't working. Also, you are required to pay with a credit card when you order online, you can't just order and pay with cash when you come in.  ANYWAY, back to the important parts. When we called to order, the women who answered was very friendly and professional and she said the food would be ready in less than 15 minutes (which anything under 20 is very exciting for me).  **DISCLAIMER: I am a total wimp when it comes to spicy things, so take what I have to say about the sauce knowing that Buffalo Chicken Dip is usually too spicy for me. moving on! Let me just say, the pulled pork and the chicken were SO GOOD! The quality of the meat was excellent... now for the sauces... I'll be honest, I didn't try the spicy or the tangy because I'm a crybaby, but I will say that my fiance (who is a huge fan of sauces that make him sweat) LOVED the spicy sauce.  He said it was the kind of sauce that the spicy creeps up on you and builds up the more you eat. He wasn't a fan of the tangy. Now for the sweet. You can definitely taste the honey in this one, which is fine by me because it is like a meat candy coating (yum). HOWEVER, there is a kick to it... and it also creeps up on you. By the time I was done with my pulled pork, I was running to the kitchen to grab some milk to help ease the spice. Again, it may not be spicy at all, but it was spicy to me.. but still enjoyable! The flavor was excellent. We also got the mac n cheese-- it wasn't bad, nor the best. I'd say it needs a bit more salt, some breadcrumbs, and maybe a more flavorful cheese combo. Cole Slaw- vinegar based. not bad, i'll get it again. Moral of the story: This place is freakin delicious and we are so excited to have an AWESOME BBQ place within walking distance from our house. We're excited to try the other sides, and we'll be back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and so far I am a fan. I typically get the 2 meat platter and 2 sides. The brisket has always been spot on and I add a little bit of the spicy sauce and go to town. The ribs can sometimes be inconsistent, I have had them just perfect while other times they seem to be a little dry and burnt. When the ribs are good, I don't even put sauce on them. When they are a little off I wonder why I just didn't get more brisket instead. When it comes to the sides I always get the mac and cheese and whatever vegetable they have that day. From what I can tell the veggies always seem to be fresh and not from a can.  I also recommend checking out their facebook page or twitter since they sometimes mix it up and have special items just for that day. They recently had pork belly and prior to that these chicken wings that had some of the best seasoning I ever tasted.  Yes, sometimes they will run out of certain items as does any good BBQ place. Good BBQ takes a while to cook. You don't want to go to some place that just has frozen garbage on hand that they pop in a microwave at any time. I would almost be skeptical of a BBQ place that doesn't run out of certain items.   They also get bonus points for staying open a little later than most of the other restaurants in the area. Not everyone eats dinner at 4PM!  Alright an update after eating at this place for close to a year. It's still a solid option for BBQ in the area. I did however finally figure out why sometimes it can be a little inconsistent and the meat is a little dry. If you see a taller black guy cooking, just walk out and try again on another day. When he is cooking the food is always dry and sometimes cold."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and were very pleased! My husband is picky when it comes to BBQ-- we lived down South for a few years and have been looking for some good BBQ since moving to Pittsburgh. Smog Pitt's ribs and cornbread are fantastic. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We pass by this place on Brookline Blvd often and it smells so good that I have always wanted to stop in for dinner. I have heard very mixed reviews but don't let that stop you from trying it out. This place was busy on a Saturday evening but we got a seat right by the window. It is BYOB and no corkage fee- make sure to bring your own bottle opener as they were busy and you order at a counter so not really a server to help you out.  We sat for a while enjoying our beers and having a hard time deciding what to order-it all looked delicious. I went with the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese as my side. The mac and cheese was good but a but spicy for me. The pulled pork was so tasty with an amazing flavor! The sandwich came with huge portion of meat and you have your choose of a tangy, sweet or hot sauce to add in-all tasty. I also added corn bread as a side and green beans for some veggies. The corn bread muffin was the best corn bread I have ever tasted-not to dry and a sweet flavor-a must try (jalape√±o flavor to try as well). My fianc√© also got the brisket which he really enjoyed. My other advice to you is to eat in vs getting take out and not go right before closing- the close early at 9.  The prices are reasonable and you get a nice size portion of food."}
{"text":"I'm here now.  Employees did not start making our food until 10 minutes after we ordered.  There was only one other couple in the place. Workers standing around EATING while making food. Eating, the entire time!  Entire... Time.  Gross  Food was undeniably cool to l temp. Food must have been cooked and kept in the fridge all night then brought to just a smidge higher than room temp  for service.    At one point, the server placed sauce on our tray and her nails touched our food.  Again, gross.  Fried chicken was good.  Cole slaw was wilted... That would take DAYS.  Pulled pork tough and chewy.  They're still eating.    Silver lining: A clean bathroom and good ranch dressing.   In response to owners response:  I know good food and I know it well. The food was not to temp and was certainly leftovers.  I didn't go into further detail because there was just so much wrong.  For instance; the particles of old chicken on the new wings--that is due to old grease. How about your employees eating the entire time--that is in food-service violation.The Mac and cheese, cold and mushy.  Brisket overdone and dry.  Pulled pork tough. Chicken was not dropped until after 10 minutes after we ordered. Slaw was absolutely not made fresh that morning. Your employee's manicured nails are far too long to be working with food.   It's a very unprofessional environment.  Bamas was bad,  and I was hoping for something better--I received worse.    We paid and tipped despite its horrid nature. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We had the brisket and baby back ribs. All very good. Having a choice between three sauces was nice, spicy, sweet and tangy. Not the best I've ever had, for me that is Clem's in Blairsville, PA"}
{"text":"The delicious smell of smoky goodness hits you hard as soon as you open the door. Food was great, portions were humongous and service was friendly. However, a tad confusing set-up for a newbie, which I'll explain later.   My husband and I each got the two meats with two sides combo for $14 each. Between the two of us, we got to sample the sliced brisket, baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, mac and cheese, cole slaw, yams and onion rings. The meats were delicious! While the sides were just average. The meats were incredibly moist with a dry rub on them that made them so flavorful alone, not to mention the strong, distinct smoke flavor. If that wasn't enough flavor, they had an array of sauces: regular bbq sauce, sweet sauce, tangy sauce, spicy bbq sauce and their hot sauce.  I enjoyed all the sauces and can't really pick a favorite.   The space is pretty small with six tables and a counter in the back (and that's where you order). The night my husband and I came here, all the tables were taken, which they had a few chairs to the side for the folks waiting. A thing to note: don't expect someone to come wait on you; you have to walk up to the counter and put your order in. That's the mistake another couple who got there before us did and they unfortunately ended up getting seated and waited on after us. We ultimately gave up our table to them. What Smoq Pit needs is a sign that says \"order here\" or something at the counter. Or the workers just need to address everyone in the restaurant.   I would definitely come back for barbecue. However, next time, I will probably skip the sides and just order the meats."}
{"text":"No no no no no!!!!!! I'm so disappointed. Here's some bullet points: - clearly stated on the menu under SIDES (and on the board in this joint) A TASTE OF RIBS. Fianc√© ordered it- ribs aren't a side. Okay, fine strike 1.  - ordered pulled pork, at a bbq joint. Out of pulled pork. Okay, thanks anyway . Strike 2  - we both got brisket plate with 2 sides. Food came out fast and it looked like we ordered appetizers. Well our bill was $30 so hopefully the taste matches the price.   - my fianc√© loved the brisket . I ate some of mine and gave the rest to him. Wasn't impressed.  -his baked beans looked more like bean soup.   -the macaroni and cheese had ZERO flavor. And I mean zero. I put bbq sauce on it for some sort of taste. Still couldn't bear it. Strike 3.   - cornbread was good.   Not going back."}
{"text":"The best pulled pork in the Burgh. Tender, but not too limp and very tasty. Excellent cole slaw. My partner loved her baby back ribs. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"There are few bbq places in Pgh to begin with and especially in the winter time. To be able to order bbq delivery when it's 9 degrees outside is awesome. The pulled pork is delicious and my son loved the Mac n Cheese. The meat portion is large enough for me to have a few more meals from it too. Found my new go to bbq place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I wanted to like this place so much!  Myself and 2 friends decided to give this new BBQ place a try. We ordered delivery because it was a beautiful Sunday and we were out swimming.  Since this is a new place, and none of us had yet tried it, we ordered the 4 meats (pulled pork, chicken, ribs, and brisket) which came with 2 sides (onion rings, mac and cheese), as well as an ordering an additional side of mac and cheese, and a side of cornbread.  Where to start... The pulled Pork was ok. Nothing special. Had I known how the rest of the food was going to taste, I would have hoarded this for just myself! The chicken was ok on taste, however, it was so burned on the outside and so dry on the inside that when you physically tried to chew it, the meat disintegrated in your mouth - this was the most unusual thing that I have ever experienced as far as textures are concerned - think astronaut ice cream. The ribs - terrible, these actually tasted like they weren't cooked all the way, so we all took 1 bite of our rib and threw it away. Onto the brisket - this was ok, nothing special. Very similar to the Pork - nothing to write home about. The sauces were just weird as well. The spicy sauce was the agreed upon favorite. The sweet sauce had so much nutmeg in it that we thought we were eating pumpkin pie! On a good note, it was preparing us for the pending arrival of fall. The tangy sauce - well it just tasted like watered down mustard - no thanks.  Onto the sides shall we, because after all at this point the 3 of us have had to split the equivalent of 1 pulled pork and 1 brisket sandwich.  The mac and cheese was disgusting. It had zero flavor and was so gritty that we questioned if there was actual sand in it. The onion ring on the other hand were amazing - the 3 of us fought over the 7 onion rings that classified as a side.  Now for the Trump Card - the cornbread......I am pretty sure I will never look at cornbread ever again. Lucky for me, I couldn't get it past my nose and into my mouth. I wish I would have thought to take a picture of it. The corn\"bread\" was practically raw, and had the consistency of the corn cake that Chi Chi's used to serve (which II loved!). Here is what go us - it was wrapped in aluminum foil and as soon as I opened it up, the entire area around us smelled like mildew! Friend actually put it in his mouth and immediately spit it out and was basically choking on it! After the smell of it and that response to tasting it, I passed and decided that a dissection would be better suited for this.....and low and behold, there was mildew!  Do not waste your time or your money! I would have rather either a loaf of plain white bread then this, and it would have saved me $40 (it was my turn to buy)! Normally I would give a place a second chance if the food was as good as I expected or if they also had some good ratings to convince me that it was a fluke thing. They should be embarrassed to serve this, especially to paying customers!"}
{"text":"This place has the best barbecue in Pittsburgh! It is so good. The beef ribs are so tender and delicious. I got a Groupon for $20. The portions here are huge! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Not as good as last time, portions are smaller and the brisket is wimpier.  Otherwise pretty similar to last time."}
{"text":"I read the review of Smoq in the Post-Gazette almost exactly a year ago, and since good barbecue in this area is hard to find, I tucked it away for a future date, since it's a little bit of a hike for me. I always try to support local business, and liked the owner's approach.  This week, with Memorial Day and all, sounded like a great week for some ribs, since I haven't had good ones in a while. I searched on Groupon to see if there were any deals since I had read about some people getting them on Yelp, and found one and bought it. Went on Saturday evening about 6:45 with a few other people. Never even knew where Brookline was, but always up for discovering new areas. We walked in and saw about 4 picnic-like tables and one was unoccupied which worked out just great. Right when I was about to sit down, a woman came over from behind the counter and told me they were out of ribs. Come again? They had a bunch of catering to do over the weekend and were out of ribs. It's like going to a pizza place ON ALL-ITALY WEEKEND and finding out they're out of crust. And ribs were what I'd been craving! I WILL give her credit for letting us know before we were actually situated. So we decided to stay since we had just driven 1/2 hour, and figured we could still get some barbecue (she said the pulled pork had just come out).   I ordered a combo plate of pulled pork and brisket, and got yams and baked beans as sides. I'll give them props on their no corkage fee on the beers we brought too. When trays of food came out for two of our party including me, I would normally have waited until all the food arrived, but was told by the other two that we should start eating while it's hot. So I took a forkful of the pulled pork. I could easily have waited since there wasn't a scintilla of heat to it! I found this somewhat bizarre since the beans were mouth-burning hot (and delicious I might add) AND the pork \"had just come out.\" In any event, I moved on to the brisket, which was in slices instead of pulled. I cut off a piece and found that it too was not hot AND was awfully chewy. AND it didn't have an awful lot of flavor (same for the PP). The yams were fine, and after doctoring the meats with a mixture of their sauces, I was able to satisfy my hunger. I didn't send anything back because we had already been there for awhile and really didn't want anything microwaved.  I am so glad I had the Groupon because it made the cost bearable. I don't think their prices are out of line if their food was good (or even available for that matter). But I was NOT impressed and will NOT be going back. I DO however want to mention that the young woman who waited on us was extraordinarily nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Took home ribs, coleslaw and mac&cheese.Ribs were tough , I put them in foil and cooked 2 hours to make them tender. The coleslaw was dry and tasteless. Mac&cheese lacked cheese also tasteless."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 10 times and it is always a wonderful experience.  I have eaten there and had take out, and never been disappointed. A few recommendations...pulled pork - always juicy and fresh. I don't even put sauce on it unless it's a sandwich because there is so much flavor.  The St. Louis ribs...I like them with the sweet sauce. The brisket is very good as well which leads me to my next suggestion - get the meat combos and try more than one! The mac and cheese is good, as long as it is fresh, which 9 out of 10 times it has been. Another thing to try is s'mores pie...extremely sweet but tasty. A side note....one day I got take out and left my drink on the counter.  The owner van across Brookline Boulevard to bring it to me. In my opinion,  the longer this place has been open, the better it gets."}
{"text":"I saw on Facebook that SMOQ PITT was offering a Groupon and since I like BBQ but hadn't yet tried this particular establishment, I bought a Groupon for lunch and headed over on a Wednesday around noon to order takeout.  I was able to park my car right in front of SMOQ PITT on Brookline Boulevard.  And as soon as I opened my door, wow, did it smell delicious.  I was hoping this was a sign of good things to come.    A few other people were already inside when I arrived.  Here's where I have to deduct a star.  There was only one person taking food orders while I saw 3 other employees wandering around.  Good customer service would be having a second person jump in on register.  But it wasn't until the one employee at the register answered the phone to take a to-go order that someone else finally came up.  I don't know why the ordering took so long, but it did.  It was a little frustrating, especially when all I can smell is smoked meats.  Once I was able to place my order I did so rather quickly and then didn't have to wait long after that.  I didn't find anyone rude or unfriendly, it was just that the wait at first seemed unnecessary.   On to the good stuff.  I ordered two meat plates with sides in order to try a bit of everything.  (After I ordered and started looking at the to-go menus I noticed that they do offer combo plates where you can get two or three meats and two sides which was not written on the menu boards hanging on the wall.)  I went with a pulled pork plate with baked beans and cole slaw and a brisket plate with mac n cheese and cole slaw.  Since I had never been before I asked for a container of each sauce (sweet, spicy, tangy) so I could see what I liked.    As I was waiting for my order to be filled, I read about SMOQ PITT.  They rub local meats with their own special spice blend before smoking for hours over several different types of wood.  The smell was amazing and I enjoyed watching the one employee carving all the meat as it was ordered.  You can tell a lot of care is taken with the preparation here.  I couldn't wait to get home.  My order was all packaged separately (meats in their own container, sides all in their own containers as well) as well as napkins, utensils and more wet wipes than I think I'll never need.  I must say I was first impressed with the portions.  The servings of both meats were more than enough for one person with the sides.  I also liked that the brisket could be ordered sliced or chopped (I elected chopped) and that they don't do away with the seasoned (or burnt) ends.  Then, there's the taste.  The pulled pork was good, but man, that brisket was magnificent.  It was so moist and had such an amazing flavor of meatiness, smokiness and seasoning that I don't know I've ever had it's equal.  I didn't even want to disguise the taste with the sauces but I did try them all.  My favorite was the tangy (more of a mustard-based sauce) though I used it sparingly.  As far as the sides, my favorite was the vinegar cole slaw (I like a nice slaw to cool things off).  The baked beans were nothing to really write about.  The mac n cheese had a mild smokey taste and was very cheesy but I felt it could have had more flavor.  SMOQ PITT made a good first impression.  Once I got over the initial wait to order (which may have had something to do with being so hungry while standing in a place that smelled so great), it was all good news.  Even without the Groupon, I think SMOQ PITT is reasonably priced for the quality and taste of their food.  I may even be back for some of those ribs."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, and I could not be more disappointed. I ordered the full rack of St. Louis ribs with cornbread, mac and cheese, green beans, coleslaw, and the beans. The rack of ribs were dry and tasteless. The container holding the ribs had broken open because the box got wet. The coleslaw had been placed directly on top of the hot green beans so had to be immediately thrown out. The green beans were limp and hardly good for human consumption. The cornbread was cold and also inedible. The mac and cheese was okay but not very appealing.  This was beyond unacceptable, and I would highly recommend anyplace else."}
{"text":"After rave reviews from my brother in law, my husband and I stopped by the Smoq Pit on a Friday night with two of our friends. The dining area is small with just 5 tables, which isn't an issue at 6:30 as we had the place to ourselves. All diners chose the 2 meats / 2 sides for $14. I had lemonade to drink, which was homemade and a good balance between sweet and tart. I chose the chopped brisket, pulled pork, Mac and cheese and cornbread. This was SO much food. The pulled pork was fantastic, the brisket wasn't anything special. The Mac and cheese was unique and delicious and the cornbread is sweet and so dense that light might have a hard time escaping from it. They have three sauces...the spicy is, well, spicy. The tangy just tastes like mustard and the sweet is ....different.  I'm not blown away by the sauces, but the good news is that the pulled pork can stand alone. It's so juicy, smokey and flavorful, it needs no condiment assistance to tantalize your tastebuds.  The other members of my dining party had these tips :  the baby back ribs were dynamite, lots of meat on those bones! The baked beans had a great spicy kick to them , and the sweet tea was a great compliment to the meal.  I plan to return and get less food so I can try a s'mores pie. I would also LOVE to see a tangy/sweet vinegar based sauce to put on my pulled pork sandwich. Looking forward to another bite at the Smoq Pit!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the efficiency of service needs to be kicked up a notch.  Been here a couple of times and by the time the food has gotten to me once or twice it's been cold, but they remedied that pretty quick so no real complaints.  Get the onion rings for sure."}
{"text":"I have looked long and hard for the best BBQ in Pittsburgh. My fianc√© and I decided right after our engagement that we wanted southern cuisine at our reception, and we set out to find the best BBQ caterer in Pittsburgh.   We were beginning to lose hope, UNTIL we we tried the Smoq Pitt. We stopped by one Sunday afternoon and ordered multiple items for takeout. We let the owner, Mitch, know that we were interested in catering options, and he gave us great insight into options for our wedding. He was willing to go off-menu for us, which shows what an awesome chef he is!   We then tried the food, and were blown away. First of all, the portions are generous!! We ate our order for three days! Second, the food itself is delicious. The ribs are smoky and fall off the bone. The dry rub on the pulled pork is so good that it doesn't need sauce, but definitely ask for some of the Chicago Fire spicy sauce!! My fianc√© loved the tender brisket and creamy Mac and cheese.   We have since taken both families to experience the amazing BBQ, and they can't stop talking about it, either!! We are so excited for our wedding, and can't wait for the food!! Go to the Smoq Pitf ASAP and try the best BBQ in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but as someone else mentioned, they have a Groupon deal/s which are pretty awesome, so we ordered take out on a Friday night.  There were a few tables filled and another person getting take out, so I waited in the line as the delicious smoke filled my lungs.  If you don't like smoked meats, you won't like their bbq.  It's super smokey!  I ordered a half rack with fries and a 2 meats, 2 sides with ribs, pulled pork, yams and onion rings.  The meats are awesome - fall off the bone delicious with some great flavor.  I always order them naked, so I can try the three sauces.  To me, the spicy is too spicy, the sweet a bit too sweet, but I love the tangy which is mustard based and perfect.  My husband prefers the sweet.  I'd never had the yams or the onion rings and I have to say that the onion rings are hands down the best onion rings I have ever had.  Super crunchy and crispy with a nice piece of onion that isn't stringy.  The fries are always awesome and the yams taste just sweet enough without being overpowering.    I also ordered the bread pudding, which was a mistake and which is why they don't get 5 stars.  It tasted like white bread was dipped in pork smoke grease and then put into the bread pudding mold and slathered in honey and bourbon.  I am not sure what they were intending, but they really should just not serve desserts rather than serve this.    Thankfully, even the awful bread pudding did not dissuade me from saying that this is one of my favorite bbq joints in town."}
{"text":"After trying to find the taste of Brookline which actually didn't exist this year, we stumbled upon SMOQ. The inside is quite small with only a few tables and a counter. We reviewed the menu on the chalkboard and ordered at the counter. There was a small basket of dumb dumbs and starbursts for the taking in the counter. I was a little disappointed in their drink section. They had a very limited selection of bottled and canned beverages. I was told that they are BYOB. Hubs and I decided to go with the three meat platter in order to try a few options. We sat down and were served rather quickly.  Our meal came out on a tray which we put between us. We were offered one of their sauces on the side but opted to try all three. My favorite was definitely the spicy sauce but hubs preferred the sweet. I proceeded to dig into the pulled pork. I was immediately impressed. Tender, juicy with a great smoky flavor. The brisket was also very good though I thought it lacked the depth of flavor I loved about the pulled pork. The chicken was my least favorite of the three options as it was a little dry for my taste. As for the sides, the fries were great but the mac and cheese was a bit watery and lacked richness. Overall, SMOQ is off to a great start. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and it was delicious. We got pulled pork, brisket and chicken. The chicken was my favorite. My kids loved the mac n cheese. We'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"Update....   After my post, I was immediately contacted to ensure this doesn't happen again.     What a great customer service experience!     I will give a second thought and definitely go back.   Thank you for caring .      I've been looking to try this place out and ended up ordering takeout.   I ordered pulled pork which we they were out of... Now, we only found this out when we went to pick up the food.  ...a barbecue place who runs out of pulled pork.  Interesting.   We ended up getting brisket but now we had to wait.  We also ordered baby back ribs.  They were the toughest ribs I ever ate.  I actually struggled to pull them apart with both hands.  The cook,  unfriendly.  $47.00 down the drain.  We won't be back.  However,  If this is the food everyday they won't last long."}
{"text":"I want to give them four or five stars, but I can't.... yet. There is a good chance the negatives are from opening kinks, but it is what it is. I will try again and update.   We had pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, mac and cheese, and corn bread. This place has real BBQ. you can smell it from the sidewalk and you can taste the smoke exactly how you should. The pulled porked was really good. I can't say great becuase it was a little tough. The ribs were way too tough. Like another reviewer, I had to cut them apart with a knife. Ribs are hard to cook in smoke. Really hard. But, you expect a BBQ joint to get it right. The mac and cheese is just OK. The cornbread is crumbly. To steer back towards the positive, I will say the flavor was just about what I would expect out of a smoke pit. My hands still smell like smoke and that is a good thing.  They obvioulsy are going through some opening difficulties. We would have had baked beans, but they forgot to put it in the order. That is part of the reason I am knocking stars off. They also lost my online order. I heistate to report that becuae things happen and they were genuinely sorry for it. But, in the interest of full disclosure, there you have it.   For $30, we had enough food to feed four people (I ordered for my wife and I). The rack of ribs was huge. There was also a generous amount of pulled pork.   I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again and I would recommend to anyone else. It is hard to find real BBQ here and this is the real thing. I think they will dial it in. They are brand new and you can tell the passion is there."}
{"text":"Few places that serve good 'Q' in The Burgh and this is one of them. Classic southern style barbeque with classic sides you'd find in any smoke joint in the Carolinas. The atmosphere was lacking, falling somewhere between cafeteria and cookout."}
{"text":"Really good take out BBQ. Daily specials, Groupon deals, delicious food. The restaurant is not a place you really want to sit down and eat, but the food is great and staff is very friendly. Highly recommend the ribs, wings, pulled pork, sides. Great prices and quality BBQ! We will definitely be back for more take out!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue I've had in Pittsburgh. It's so tough to find really good barbecue here. I'm more of a dry rub fan for ribs- I find that a lot of places use the sauce to cover up or compensate for lots of fat. These ribs were the opposite. Mostly dry rub in 2 styles with thick meaty ribs. Couldn't tear them apart- had to cut them with a steak knife- proof of quality ribs! \"Fall off the bone\" ribs end up being half fat. Not my thing. The meat was cooked perfectly, not dried out and still mouth watering. The Mac and cheese and cornbread are great. Baked beans are exactly what they should be- firm beans with spices mixed in. They're not your canned brown sauce beans. Best part is they deliver! Can't wait to try the s'mores pie!"}
{"text":"On this first day of spring with the snow flying and a fire glowing in the fireplace as the Bird and I began watching Jesus of Nazareth to begin Holy Week it wasn't too soon when thoughts of dinner were brought up.  We both agreed that we did not want to venture out nor cook anything ourselves so delivery options were discussed.  I pulled up Yelp and came across Smoq Pit BBQ.  COMFORT FOOD!  When I read that they delivered our excitement grew.  We explored the menu and I called to place our orders.  After confirming that we were within the 5 mile delivery area I continued to order.  I went with the 2 meat option and chose the brisket and half rack ofSt. Louis.  This came with two sides but I just asked for a double order of coleslaw.  The person who took my order was very patient, Dana or Diane I believe, and suggested I sample all of the sauces.  The Bird ordered a special sandwich that had brisket and coleslaw.  Her side was the Mac and cheese but also ordered the corn bread and bread pudding.  We were told we could pay with debit card and that it would be 45-60 min.  Ding Dong....40 minutes later the food arrived.  A good sign was that the bag was heavy.  When pulling out the containers we were both pleased that everything was larger than expected.  The sides were normal.  The ribs were excellent.  I did not need a knife as everything was easily pulled from the bones.  Of the three sauces, tangy (mustard), sweet bbq, or spicy bbq I liked the sweet the best whereas The Bird liked the Spicy.  They were all very good.  The brisket was above par as well.  My coleslaw, which is a vinegar based, was not my favorite ...at first.  I was going to abandon it until I poured the tangy sauce in it and mixed it up.  It tasted like the two belonged together.  The Bird liked her Mac & Cheese and said the Corn Bread was excellent.  She only had a small piece of the bourbon bread pudding.  She loved it.  She could not eat all of the Bread Pudding as she did finish the giant sandwich.  It was too big for her so she had to remove the top bun and eat it open faced.  We both agreed that the Smoq Pit will be part of our delivery options this summer."}
{"text":"We're southern bbq lovers and spend a lot of time in Memphis - sadly, we were disappointed by this  place   We had St. Louis style ribs, Mac n cheese, and corn bread, and honestly, none of it was fantastic. The ribs were really dry and there was so much rub on them that they tasted burnt.  The Mac and cheese was mushy and greasy and the cornbread was bone.dry.  I'm hoping we just went on an off day, because this could be an awesome addition to Brookline."}
{"text":"The BBQ was excellent! I got the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the brisket and pulled pork sandwich. We both really enjoyed our food! The sandwich buns were nice and hearty, had great flavor and didn't get mushy.   The sides were just as good as the main dishes. We had baked beans, coleslaw which was out of this world...made with vinegar not mayo, and baked beans.   The portions were huge, good bang for your buck. We had enough food for two more meals to take home.  Sauces were served on the side, not directly on the meat. They had spicy, sweet, and tangy. I wasn't a big fan of the sweet. I liked the spicy, would like to have had my meat cooked in the sauce, maybe I'll request it next time.   The staff was very friendly and they had a candy dish at the counter with starbursts...YUM! My only complaint was  that we sat down to eat and it was really hot inside not sure if there is no air conditioning in the building or not.   I'd definitely go back. Can't wait to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"Tried four different meats, by far loved the St. louis the most then the pulled pork.  Fries are also very good.  Lemonade is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Got 3 meat 2 sides. Got discount since used yelp so thats a plus. Nice portions. Mac n cheese and fries were very good and seasoned. Brisket was chopped and fatty but still good. Pulled pork was awesome. I didnt eat everything at once but took the ribs for lunch and def not pull off the bone. I def had to work. Flavor good, sauces are good. I would go again."}
{"text":"Very good bbq. I got the brisket sandwich, and put tons of the tangy sauce on. My son's got pulled pork sandwiches, and they loved them. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I will go back."}
{"text":"This was the worst service we have ever had at a restaurant.  We called at 6:40pm with a take-out order. We were told the order would be ready in 20 minutes and arrived at the restaurant accordingly.   Once at Smoq Pit, we had to wait in line behind 8-9 other customers who did not think to order their food ahead of time. The employee at the counter kept telling them that things were sold out, but we were confident in our order being prepared because we had placed a take-out order.   We reached the register at 7:20pm, a full 40 minutes after we called our order in. It was then that we realized how poorly managed the restaurant was. Our order slip was hanging on the rack, an ominous sign for sure. We reviewed our order with the employee and found out that they were sold out of every item we ordered. Every single item. No one thought to call me to let me know about this unfortunate series of events, even though I provided my phone number when I placed my order.   Most infuriating about this situation is that the customers in line in front of me were leaving with food. The brisket that was sold out by the time I got to the register walked out the door with two young gentleman. A family eating in the restaurant had the cornbread that I had ordered.   I am completely disappointed by this experience and I did not even have a chance to eat the food. I do not think I will be attempting to order from Smoq Pit again."}
{"text":"Just moved to Mt Lebo and they deliver here!  Very reasonable prices and they were quick to deliver. I love having this as an option for delivery! Where I moved from, pizza was my only delivery choice. I think we will be having BBQ quite often now!  As far as the quality of the food, it wasn't the best ribs, but still good. We ordered baby back, but they seemed more like St Louis to me, so maybe they sent the wrong ones. The sweet sauce was great!  The fries and beans were delicious!  The cole slaw and macaroni were also good. I thought the corn bread was a bit dry."}
{"text":"My husband loves all things smothered in bbq sauce, and this place is no exception.  The environment is casual, and the food is good.  We both enjoyed our pulled pork sandwiches.  Oddly, the baked beans weren't ready during the lunch hour, so we tried the green beans and sweet potatoes instead.  The beans were crispy and delicious.  The potatoes almost tasted like pumpkin pie.  My husband loved them."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father.  We had been in the previous BBQ shop to grace this spot and enjoyed it so whenever I saw that a new one had opened up, we headed over to Brookline to give it a try.  The inside of the restaurant wasn't that much different than in its previous incarnation.  As soon as you walk in there is seating for about 20 or so people on the right with picnic plaid covering the tables and then there is a counter right in front of you.  Other than that this place has a cool feel to it as the walls have a distressed look and there are a number of older signs on the wall including a Coca-Cola sign that looks like it was used for target practice at one point in time.  For lunch I decided to order the special of the day which was the Sam and Ema brisket, pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich and for my side I decided on the mac and cheese.  My father ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich and at the last minute changed his side to the fries.  After only about a 10 minute wait, during which my father and I enjoyed watching the Price Is Right on the only TV in the restaurant, our food was brought out to us.  My meal came out first and the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was.  The sandwich was simply massive and I knew right away that it wasn't going to be easy to keep it on the bun.  That proved to be the only downfall of the sandwich as well because both the brisket and pulled pork were tender, moist and had a great smoky flavor to them.  The cole slaw was a nice addition as well as it gave the sandwich some extra moisture but that also caused the sandwich to collapse about half way through eating it and I ended up finishing it with my fork.  The sam.  Since the bun was fairly mushy and was not toasted at"}
{"text":"I'm here now.  Employees did not start making our food until 10 minutes after we ordered.  There was only one other couple in the place. Workers standing around EATING while making food. Eating, the entire time!  Entire... Time.  Gross  Food was undeniably cool to l temp. Food must have been cooked and kept in the fridge all night then brought to just a smidge higher than room temp  for service.    At one point, the server placed sauce on our tray and her nails touched our food.  Again, gross.  Fried chicken was good, because it had to be fried fresh.  Cole slaw was wilted... That would take DAYS.  Pulled pork tough and chewy.  Oh, they're still eating.    Silver lining: A clean bathroom and good ranch dressing.    Manager did not seem to care, and began talking about us and what we thought before we even left the joint.  Meanwhile,  down the street, some guy outside the Pub seems to be cookin' up some real BBQ.  Fail."}
{"text":"This place is very good; we ate here last week and got delivery. Ordering over the phone wasn't the best because the girl had a little attitude for us ordering a lot but the food was worth it!   Their pulled pork is amazing! I would not recommend their \"tangy sauce\" but their sweet sauce was very good and unique! Their brisket was good minus the excess fat & the ribs are good. The mac & cheese didn't seem fresh but the corn bread was good minus the corn in it.   Two down sides; The online ordering on Grub Hub never seems available. Also, they don't sell 2 liters of soda.  Over all, awesome little place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently while visiting from out of town. (I'm from North Carolina, so I'm sure some of my barbecue preferences are shifted, so take that into consideration if you'd like.)  The atmosphere was nice and the staff were friendly and on top of things. The only complaint was the food. Here are my thoughts on what I ate:  Brisket: This was pretty good. If this was my only meat, my review would probably be 3 or 4 stars. It wasn't the best brisket I've ever had... but it was good. Smoky, moist, tender. I enjoyed it.  Pulled pork: Honestly, terrible. It was extremely dry, and I didn't care for the seasoning at all. I wasn't expecting true Eastern NC 'cue, but I've had pulled pork plenty of other places, and I've never had it be dry before. Not sure what the deal was.  Mac and Cheese: Again, pretty good. Nothing to write home about (just your basic cheese with a little bit of crispy crumb topping), but I enjoyed it.  Baked Beans: Again, terrible. Very soupy - almost like bean soup rather than baked beans. And very, very tomato-y. Tasted almost like beans in a bowlful of soupy ketchup. Usually, barbecue joints have excellent baked beans that are smoky like their meats..."}
{"text":"Wow, lots of mixed reviews for this place, but I'm happy to report that my experience here was largely positive.  First, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout-out to my benevolent overlord of the Kingdom of Frugality in which I reside, Groupon. I love when Groupon has deals that allow me to try restaurants at a discount that I otherwise never would have heard of or had a reason to try. So armed with Groupon in hand, we came to Smoq Pitt on a Saturday night for dinner.  Smoq Pitt is one of those places that you smell before you see (in a good way). Delicious wafts of smokey BBQ aromas were pleasing our noses before we even set food inside. It is definitely a very tiny space, with only 5 or so tables for dining in. All of the tables were occupied on the night that we went. When we entered, we were greeted immediately by a friendly employee who told us that there were 3 parties ahead of us to be seated. She gave us menus to peruse in the meantime.  Because the food comes out fast here, the tables turn over quickly. So even with 3 parties ahead of us, and only 5 tables total, we were still seated within 15 minutes, which was awesome. There is no wait service per se....you order at the counter and then they bring your food to you when it's ready.   For my dinner, I ordered a chicken plate, which comes with a smoked chicken breast and two sides (I opted for cornbread and mac and cheese). My husband got the brisket plate with jalapeno cornbread and potato salad. We also got a side order of fries, since we had to reach $25 in total food in order for our Groupon to be accepted. We had wanted to get the s'mores pie, which sounded delicious, but unfortunately they were out of it that day (which is fair enough, but I wished they had erased it from their chalkboard menu so as to not get my hopes up only to crush them...they clearly have no idea how obsessed I am with anything s'mores-related!)  Our food came out pretty quickly. Far and away, the standouts of my meal were the sides. The cornbread, which was in muffin form, was so incredibly moist and flavorful, with chunks of whole corn throughout. I could have eaten 10 more muffins...it is one of the best pieces of cornbread I've ever had. Ditto with the mac and cheese....it was quite cheesy and flavorful. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use in there, but it tasted distinctly different from typical mac and cheese. You can definitely tell that this food is homemade. As for my chicken, the spice rub that they use as a coating was delicious, but the meat itself was quite dry. This tends to happen with smoked chicken breasts though, so I usually douse them in sauce to add some moisture. However, I wasn't a fan of any of their 3 sauces (spicy, sweet, and tangy). Each one just missed the mark in terms of flavor, so that was disappointing (especially for a BBQ place, where the sauces should be stellar). As for my husband's food, he was a happy camper all around. He reported that his brisket was super tender, his jalapeno cornbread was \"amazeballs\" (that's a technical foodie term, right?), and his potato salad was well-seasoned. He felt similarly to me in that he wasn't a huge fan of any of the BBQ sauces though, so there is definitely room for improvement there.  It's BYOB with no corkage fee (love!), so we brought our own drinks to have with our meal. Overall, there were a couple of misses with the food, but by and large, it was tasty and satisfying (did I mention that the portions are huge?!) We also found the staff to be friendly. We'd certainly return again, Groupon or not."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and we call orders something different but it was all great!  The ribs were so tender and delicious.  I order chopped brisket and it was excellent, very tender.  The sides were good too.  I recommend potato salad, mac and cheese and onion rings."}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ lover but I loved Smoq Pitt. Bought a groupon and decided to order takeout on a Saturday night. The place was packed! So so busy. Luckily, we got our order quickly. We ordered half racks of Baby Back Ribs and St Louis Ribs, mac and cheese, and cornbread. We went with the Sweet sauce. The ribs and sauce were delicious. So much food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Overall just ok.  Definitely don't bother with the cornbread.  And you could skip the Mac and cheese (weird chunky and bland).  The three sauces we tried that you can pour over your meat choice (s) were very good.  The spicy is no joke!  You'll feel that heat.  Chicken was probably the best of the four meats we tried.  Pulled pork was dry but had good flavor.  I had heard the brisket was wonderful, but mine not so much.  I also felt the portion sizes were pretty average, could have been better, based on the price."}
{"text":"We had been waiting for awhile for this place to open. We are BBQ fans so we are always excited to try new BBQ places. We walked into the restaurant and it smelled like the real deal BBQ. The decor is contemporary BBQ with red walls and unique light fixtures. The tables had the red and white checkered tablecloths.  Take Out is ordered on one side and Eat In is on the other. We greeted by a very nice lady who gave us menus.  We ordered a pulled pork platter with BBQ beans and coleslaw. We also ordered sliced brisket with coleslaw and Mac n Cheese. They have 3 sauces-Sweet, Tangy, and Spicy. The sweet and the Tangy went great with the brisket. The Spicy went well with the pork. Both the brisket and the pork were smokey and juicy. They didn't even need sauce.   The BBQ beans have a little bit of heat at the end and they are quite tasty. The coleslaw is a vinegar based coleslaw but it is very good. The Mac n cheese had REAL cheese which was delicious but the noodles were a bit soft.  We had the homemade lemonade and the homemade sweet tea. Sometimes sweet tea can be too sweet but their tea is just right.  We will be going back to try the chicken and ribs and some of the sides."}
{"text":"We were really excited to have a new restaurant open up on the Boulevard. We ended up getting some take out the second day they were open.   We got the four meat and two side combo. The pulled pork and chicken were both pretty good. They gave skin with the chicken, which is always a plus. The baby back ribs, however, were almost inedible. We actually ended up throwing most of them away. They were suuuuper tough. We had to get a knife in order to get them apart. I don't know if this is just a way that people like their ribs, but I am not one of those people. I am of the belief that ribs should be tender, in addition to having a nice bark on them. I guess I'll just stick to making ribs at home on my Weber kettle.   The mac n cheese was cheesy and flavorful. Decent. The baked beans were a bit undercooked, and seemed to just be in their spicy barbecue sauce. Cornbread came as muffin with whole corn kernels in them. Decent.   We tried all three sauces, but weren't impressed by any of them. They were all pretty similar.   We had a bourbon bread pudding for dessert, which was nice.   The inside of the place is great. Reclaimed wood and other seemingly salvaged items adorn the walls. The staff were pleasant.   I doubt we'll be returning, which makes me sad."}
{"text":"We wanted delicious meat and we got it!  what can I say?  I had the brisket and my hubby had the ribs, both were juicy, delicious large portions!  the sweet bbq sauce was really awesome!  the cornbread was soooo good!  we had mac and cheese and cole slaw as sides and they were ok, not the greatest, but we didn't go there for the sides!  Would definitely go again!  delivery was super quick and soooo friendly!  thanks Erin!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was very good and had a very smoky taste to it.  Mac and cheese can be improved on.  Onion ring were good also.  Right on the main road and had parking in front of there store.  If you have a groupon for this place make sure you don't order online.  Call in if you have a groupon.  It has place to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"According to the SMOQ PITT Facebook page, they closed as of Jan. 29, 2017.   Such a shame because their food was wonderful and the staff was very friendly.   They'll be missed for sure!!!"}
{"text":"To quote my husband, \"Wow!!! Just wow!\" Tried this place on a whim for pick up (since we live down the road) and holy hell...is it good!!!! Homemade everything! You can tell they make their own BBQ sauce, spicy baked beans, sweet coleslaw, onion rings and more. The wings are the double wings, with drum and flats and are friggin huge. Crispy outside and moist juicy inside. Loved the St. Louis ribs and loved their Mac and cheese even more. Not only was our pick up super fast but you could tell they put a lot into the take out process. Wetnaps, forks, napkins, tons of little ramekins full of their homemade sweet BBQ  sauce. My husband calls them lil cups with lids but they are RAMAKINS! Lol. Kid you not, every item had its own container, nothing was thrown together, everything in its rightful place.   I must warn you though, this place is not for the bird appetite people out there. You fill up quickly on the heavy-stick to your bone-items on the menu. So stretch out your tummy, go prepared and enjoy every bite!!!!  Merica!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with friendly staff.   The sign says, \"Rub, Smoke, Love\".  Smoq uses four different woods to smoke the meat and you will know it is smoked by the smoke smell in the restaurant and that it clings to your cloths when you leave. The ribs were nice with a smoke flavor and juicy, so better than most over cooked ribs in the area.  The meat was tender and tasty.  Three sauces were on the table.  A sweet that others liked but I thought to sweet and not a good compliment to the meat.  The Tangy was pretty good with a hint of mustard but not overpowering like most South Carolina sauces, and the spicy which was OK.  Tried the mac and cheese side and it was very good with a nice harder cheddar flavor.  Will have to come back and try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Today, my wife and I were excited to try a new restaurant that opened in Brookline called SMOQ PITT. (Spoiler alert: This place did not disappoint.) Just the aroma that hit your nose walking in the door tells you that this is a carnivore's paradise. And we immediately wanted to see what this place had to offer since they only opened yesterday. You can eat in or take the food to go which we decided to enjoy our meal at home.   We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the smoked chicken sandwich, both were delicious. The pork was juicy and flavorful while the chicken was out of this world tender. Unbelievable side dish choices as well, we both got the homemade onion rings which were of some of the best we have ever had. We tried all three of the sauces; sweet, spicy and tangy which all three were great but the spicy could have had more heat only downside.  Also interesting side note, the to-go containers were made of cardboard instead of styrofoam; glad to see something easier on the environment.    The restaurant itself is not large; a few tables with seating for about 12 and another area to stand and eat. Their concept is all about farm to table ingredients and slow smoking the bbq staples (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken) with various wood chips. The restaurant was just renovated and it has a great ambiance of reclaimed materials with modern touches. Let me tell you this place needs to make your short list for great bbq food ASAP."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money here. I had hopes for this place. All were dashed in the first 30 seconds. I was immediately told I couldn't order beef brisket or potato salad, which is what I came for. They were out. Wings, then. Nope. Out of those, too. Fine. A Shrimp Po'Boy. Not happening. Out. Now I'm irritated. If I didn't have a Groupon that expired July 5,  I would've left. I wondered why, at dinnertime, the place was empty. All 5 tables available. Hmmmm. Not good.   I orderd a full rack of baby back ribs ($17.95), which came with 2 sides. I got green beans and cornbread. Still had to use the whole $25, so I ordered another cornbread, zucchini, and s'mores. And ginger ale, though I don't drink soda.  The other choices were old lemonade or sweet tea (apparently no ice tea).  My phone was near death, so I had to either sit by the door on a bench (waiting area), or at a table 3' from the t.v. I got to see Joe Pesci's and Marisa Tomei's pores up close (My Cousin Vinny was on) while I ate. I must say, Marisa has great pores.  I told the cashier, who was nice, the one cornbread and the s'mores were to go, but she packed everything to go. She said it was easier for her, but for me, not so much. The ribs (in a cardboard box), done with a dry rub, were barely warm, but several people were at the counter, so I decided to just eat. You get a choice of sauce, served on the side. I had 2 sweet, and 2 tangy. I liked the sweet better, as it was more balanced and richer. Everything else was hot, in plastic containers, which started to warp. I took one look at the zucchini, and decided to pass, as it could've passed as baby food, it was so overcooked. The green beans were okay, but would be mush if reheated. The cornbread, which were gummy, cornbread muffins, stuck to the foil. They didn't have much flavor.  The s'mores didn't have graham crackers. They had a brownie-type item, one marshmallow, and chocolate sauce. It was okay, but it wasn't a s'more.  I won't return, and was grateful I only wasted $15, and a frustrating 2 hours. Next time, I'll get TGI Friday's baby back ribs, which were moist, meaty, and fall off the bone tender. For a limited time, their full rack of baby back ribs are only $10!"}
{"text":"Great bbq in Pittsburgh,smokey with great sauces..The ribs were great and so was the pulled pork..will go back again to try the chicken. you could tell the food was smoked for hours the old fashioned way.very friendly service"}
{"text":"It takes more than slow-smoked proteins to make good barbeque - that is the impression I was left with after my visit to this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. On my first visit I decided to try a brisket sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  I was served a deflated, soggy bun which was glistening with grease, overflowing with what appeared to be a generous pile of smoked brisket.  As I took my first bite it became immediately clear that the entire sandwich was comprised of 40% tasty, nicely barked brisket and 60% oozing, gelatinous fat.  The macaroni and cheese had even less curb appeal, yet managed to disappoint even more so than the sandwich. Anticipating a rich, creamy cheese sauce coating al dente elbow noodles.  Imagine my disappointment as I was served overcooked pasta soaked in butter with no discernible (and certainly no natural) cheese to be found.   Advice to the proprietor:   - Trim your meat!  Brisket isn't marbled like Butt - even if you are going to cheap out and leave ALL the fat on, do a better job of chopping and blending to hide your sin.    - I'm still speechless about the macaroni. You would have been better off serving Kraft.    - Seasoned french fries are yummy - but not when they are caked with a kilogram of salt, paprika and what, a dozen other ground herbs? Less is more and the fries were almost inedible."}
