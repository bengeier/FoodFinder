{"text":"Just came by to check the menu!  But as soon as I walked in; it presented a great atmosphere!  All were kind! They gave me a all day breakfast menu, along with the Lunch Menu.  I had the steak and eggs, it was made just the way I like it!
I'll be back to try some more!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bobby's for 15 years. Food has always been consistent. Although on weekends there is an expected wait and sometimes it's very long, the service is always subpar. Long waits for someone to take your order, for food, for the bill, for change! I refuse to go on weekends! 
I did go today (tues) at 1030am. No wait for a table and the food came out surprisingly fast. The service was again very frustrating. Time to switch out the ladies that are obviously tired and worn out.
Good food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast here.  The place was quite busy. The place is so dated. Ripped cushions and old chairs and table. The staff were ok. Seated us quickly and got our order. Food came on time. Huge pancakes but not that tasty. Bacon was not crisp. But overall ok food. Nothing wow about this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs benny.  I asked for medium but was given a very runny egg which I'm not a fan of.  The hollandaise sauce was rather bland and flavorless.  The side potatoes were great, nice and crispy. The service was quick and friendly. I'm giving it a 3 star cause the eggs benny were pretty average."}
{"text":"The place is nothing special at all.  We had to wait about 40 min for a very basic breakfast.  I had a waffle that came with nothing, fruit was additional cost and so was whip cream. I added the 4 pieces of bacon for a total $15.  That's nuts. I would recommend you make your bacon and eggs at home cuz you won't get anything better than you can make yourself here."}
{"text":"Wait was ok, service friendly and attentive. I liked the American diner feel of this place. Simple decor, good plentiful meals and good service.  However, it lacks the extensive menu you'd find at a diner. The breakfast platters are just too simple. Eggs, potatoes, bread, bacon.  Would love some more variety and creativity. Will go again but in no rush."}
{"text":"First, there was very little parking and even though the parking lot was full the restaurant was half empty. 

While the outside of the restaurant looks to have been renovate the inside looks like it's from the 1970s. Even though smoking in restaurants hasn't been allowed for years the restaurant still smelled like it had a smoking section. 

The service was decent and I have no complaints about it. 

I ordered the corned beef hash. It was way overpriced at north of $13. I noticed that most of the menu items were laughably overpriced. It came with a couple eggs and two pieces of toast. It was 96% potato, and 4% smoked meat. Totally underwhelming. 

I won't be be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and cheap breakfast or Brunch. Only complaint was the coffee was refilled fast enough, I had an empty cup for a good ten mins. Not fun at breakfast time! Food was great tho, I had a simple scrambled eggs, hash browns and toast. Food came quick and hot. I'll likely return."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and the food has never changed. Reminds me of the skyline if anyone remembers that. Just a classic family restaurant."}
{"text":"Bobbys is consistently good. I'm not happy the prices have rised sharply in the last few years but it's still a pretty good deal. I usually go all out and get the weekender. Expect a wait/lineup for this place esp on the weekends. Their french toast is decent, but the cinnamon french toast is tasty! Never tried the pancakes."}
{"text":"We started off our post-Christmas shopping day here.  We were super fortunately to have arrived after the first wave.  We got a parking spot (spots are limited) and we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving.  Many tables were leaving once we sat down to order, but they quickly filled up again.

Food was average, but price point is a bit higher than average for what you get.  We ordered a Bobby's Own, and an Eggs Benny.  Total bill with tip was around ~$35.  Service, as always, was very efficient and friendly, although we did have to remind our server for more cream for our coffee.  

We didn't linger as we knew it was busy.  We were seated in the back so could not see the lineups at the door, but we definitely had to walk through a crowd of people waiting to leave.  

Bobby's is a staple in the area, and serves its purpose.  Have visited many times over the years, and will continue to when in the area."}
{"text":"Satuday morning breakfast with my wife and two kids. Not a lot of parking, but we managed to grab one last spot. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated promptly.

I'm guessing we just got a waitress with a terrible memory. I ordered coffee, my wife ordered tea. We both got coffee. Oops! Had to ask twice to get it corrected.

Other kids around us had colouring sheets with crayons. Our kids didn't get that until we had been waiting 10 minutes. Just as our kids started colouring, our food came. Terrible timing.

My son wanted bacon, but he got ham. Ordered brown toast, he got white toast. Oops! No point in correcting and waiting.

The food was decent. The 1/2 pound ground round was a little too salty. Fair price. No specific kids menu - just order from the regular menu and ask for the kid's portion - smaller size, discounted price.

$45 for the four of us, very fair price for a sit down restuarant. May try it again next, but will have to hope for a better server."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch for the first time this past Sunday. Arrived around 2pm and it was quite busy, but we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. We parked in the parking lot across the street instead of the restaurant's, as it is quite small. 

I ordered the Spanish omelette that came with toast on the side and it was delish :) The proportions were more than enough for me. 

I would say prices are more or less average And would definitely return here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy breakfast place with all the usual items. Waffles are a constant for me while hubby likes the corned beef hash.   It's quite a lot of food and you most likely won't need lunch afterwards.   Have never returned for lunch or supper because I always think of this place as breakfast only.  

Can be quite a wait on weekends for brunch.  Longest wait we had was about 20 minutes on a Saturday.  Weekdays aren't a problem at all."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab some all day breakfast and came across Bobby's Hideaway. Nice assortment of breakfast, as well as lunch and dinner fair. We had the Eggs Benedict and Chocolate Chip Pancakes with bacon and both were delicious and filling. Overall, good food, nice cozy atmosphere, nice server and the prices are decent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Brilliant, a welcomed addition to my work week. Looking forward to bringing my kids this weekend...

You get all that you pay for, then some..."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for breakfast. French toast and eggs Benedict. Food was decent and the server was nice. Definitely a local place which was nice after dealing with airports and flying."}
{"text":"All in all the place is OK, I have had better! Lets get down to logistics of it:

The FOOD: as we were three people we ordered a bunch of things... The portions were decent and food on overall basis tasted well, except the peameal Bacon as per my friend. The Pan cakes were huge. The only thing missing on the plates were the fruits which pretty much all breakfast joint provide.

The PLACE: the place was open and wide. So it was breathable and not a small box fitted with some chairs. The seating were comfortable and they have various types of seats.

The Service: The staff was polite, quick and nice. 

The Price: I think it was reasonably prices for breakfast when compared to other places and you can get a decent meal between $10 to $11. 

The only thing happened wrong was the cup they provided for tea wasn't washed properly but it was a quick fix and they provided a new cup. These things happen as I have worked in a restaurant and sometimes the dishwasher doesn't do much.

Well if you are in Streetsville and need a place for breakfast this would be around the corner."}
{"text":"Hands down; this is the best breakfast place I've been into. We came in on a Sunday morning. It took about 20 mins to get a table, and it was worth it! 

I ordered the Steak and egg special; steak done medium rare and the eggs--sunny side up. We got the food quickly and just devoured it! There was no need for any condiments. 

My partner ordered the waffle, bacon & eggs and had enjoyed that equally. 

I would recommend this restaurant for breakfast to my friends & family. 

Thank you for your great service!"}
{"text":"Still a great go-to breakfast place! I came back today with family from out of town and everyone enjoyed it! 

It was quite busy considering it's thanksgiving Monday but it was expected. But we got seated very quickly! There were about 3 groups ahead of us and they were seated within 7 minutes when we arrived. It was very busy but they managed to be super friendly and had everything under control! We were a table of 8 and waited no more than 10 minutes for our table. 

Food was good! Everything came at a reasonable time and all orders were correct. We got everything we needed and our waitress came back often to make sure everything was ok! she was super nice! 

The back of the restaurant was really hot though (it's not usually) so it was kinda uncomfortable but will still continue to come here!"}
{"text":"Very clean, friendly service, Nice Decour. Comfortable seating. Food portions a little on the small side."}
{"text":"This is definitely within the top 5 spots for breakfast in Mississauga. Every Sunday at brunch time, there are long times for this place. The feel is very intimate and homey and the food is great. I love their pancakes, they're so soft and buttery."}
{"text":"Super busy spot but can get a table pretty fast. Love the breakfast options here and would love to come and try lunch sometime.
Only downfall is parking!"}
{"text":"I live down the street and this is one of the last few places left standing that serves excellent, home-like cooked meals.. this place can get very busy and for a very good reason!  If service is slow its because they are doing it right the first time.. my wife and I are yet to be disappointed..  oh! and the walls are covered with colorful cartoon prints of famous Bobby characters.. this restaurant makes us feel warm and welcome every time!! Its always a pleasure to eat here.. prices are good for what you get.. the soup is always different and always very tasty not to mention the fish and chips made from the best fish with the most yummy tar-tar sauce!! 

If your in the area and your looking for a nice restaurant, this is it!"}
{"text":"now this place serves good tasting breakfast, you can just tell the cooks at the back knows what they are doing, as a matter of fact I am taking my friend for breakfast tomorrow 

awesome place, ok service and it is not a cheap place my bill is around $15.00 dollars with bottomless coffee"}
{"text":"Eewww. This place blows, not sure why the locals even bother. I've had better breakfasts at the Sunset Grill chains. 

Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all. Parking was a bit of trouble when its filled, but this place is cute. Nice country charm with the stained glass windows, and the mix match of artwork. A very homely feel when you walk in, especially friendly service, and a great crowd of customers. The menu had the basics, I ordered scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, home fries, toast, and a side of blueberry pancakes. Eggs were standard, as was the meats. My mom loved their peameal bacon, it was grilled to crisp and wasn't soggy. I quite like their home fries, it was nicely seasoned.  The pancakes were a nice size, and was nice and soft. Coffee was frequently poured, and although the place was packed, the crowd was pleasantly quieter than usual. A definite must try if you are ever in Streetsville. I can't wait to come back and check out their homemade deserts!"}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, give us half stars! It deserves a 3.5, but 3 wouldn't be fair. Like others have said, it standard fare, so know what you're coming in for. I really enjoy the corned beef hash and was told by the waitress they they make their corned beef (since I really didn't want canned).  I once had their Schnitzel (which they also make from scratch), but I will say the taste was pretty average. My wife thought the fish and chips were solid. Awhile ago I believe I had their turkey club. Again, won't let you down, but not particularly memorable. The lunch/dinners seem to be well-made, albeit unspectacular. I think breakfasts are their true strength."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends cause one of my friends said she comes here all the time.
She always gets the egg benedict and hot chocolate (comes with whipped cream on top)
I got the 2 eggs combo with sausage and my other friend got an omelette and we shared a pancake dish (comes with 3 huge pancakes)
The omelette was huge, my friend only ate half of it and was full. The egg combo came with 3 pieces of sausage and a lot of home fries. We both got coffee, which is refillable.
Our waiter was really really nice, he joked around with us a lot.
The restaurant itself is really big and the atmosphere was really nice.
Overall I would definitely come again whenever I have the time and am craving for an American breakfast."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place.  It's quiet and has a homely feel to it.  Their menu offers a variety of breakfast/brunch options, but there are also lunch options for those who want something heavier.  I opted for the eggs benedict and they were delicious.  The Hollandaise sauce was so flavourful my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The homefries were great too, seasoned very well.  It was a filling meal and I'm excited to come back and try their omelettes.  I wonder if I can order a side of Hollandaise sauce..."}
{"text":"I got the weekender special.  Around 14 bucks but came with quite a big meal.  I didnt end up finishing it.  The place had a nice and cozy feel.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"we came here on a Friday morning around 9am, lots of parking spots, get served right away and our food order came quickly.  The server was friendly.  We ordered the \"Weekender\" and the portion is reasonable. Overall, the food quality is good, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem hidden close to Streetsville.

Food was great (especially the potatoes!!!!)"}
{"text":"A very nice breakfast diner. If you go on the weekend I'd suggest you avoid 10:00 am to 11:30 am as you can expect a 20-30 min wait.  Larger groups (8-10) may have to wait longer. 

The coffee is decent and they will refill it frequently during your meal. 

My personal fave is The Big Bobby (1/2 lbs of ground round). I also ask for extra crispy home fries.  The regular ones can be more like mushy potatoes.  

For lunch my daughter loves their Fish & Chips whereas my Mum and Dad love the Liver and Onions.   The burger is decent as is the steak.  Then again you can still ask for the Big Bobby for dinner. Yum. ;-)"}
{"text":"Party of 12 in my group.  Very efficient service.  We ordered everything fro. Steak and eggs, waffle, weekender, corned beef hash etc.  Everything tasted good. Coffee refills just kept on coming.  Order the home fries to be cooked more crispy because it tastes even better!"}
{"text":"Menu very simple yet has all the comforts of a home breakfast, atmosphere was very welcome and very relaxed. I had the Denver omelet with home fries, rye toast and Earl Grey tea, was very filling. My partner had the two eggs (over easy), home fries and toast. Both of us found it very filling. My only complaint is that parking was a bit of trouble."}
{"text":"I did not expect much from a 3.5 star rated place.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was awesome. It tasted like a home cooked meal from an aunt who is a dedicated cook.  I had the Bobby's Own, which is scrambled egg with sausage, potatoes, toast and coffee.  I asked for slices of tomato and it worked out well.   I am not sure how to describe this place, other than to say that it is a solid breakfast place that serves good food.  There was ample line when we went and waited about 20 min, was Sunday at 10am.  My wife and two other people liked the food they ordered as well.   The decor was pleasant, and each table was busy with people chowing down.    This is one of those instances where Yelp review is not correct.  Bobby's Hideaway deserves at least 4 stars.   I will be back here for sure.  This is a local business that is not a franchise operation producing cookie cutter style goods.  B.H. makes solid breakfast at fair price.  The price at B.H. is not cheap, as each meal averages out about $15/person with tax and tip.   I would have been happier if the meal was more like $10-12, but meal of this caliber is fair priced at $15/person.   I am not sure about their lunch or dinner as I only went for breakfast;from observing others' peoples food and mine this place is worth a try for those craving western breakfast food.

Billybob."}
{"text":"I liked it...the 3 is based on it still feeling a bit like it has growing pains. I waited a really long time for my bill...and eventually gave up waiting for the server to come back to the machine. In her defense not busy but was training someone.  Friendly tho and obviously making an effort to get to know customers. 
Food was good big portions great value from that point of view. I'll go back for a breakfast soon but enjoyed the smoked meat platter meal."}
{"text":"First time. Very generous portions. We ordered the weekender and it was enough for three of us! Order your bacon extra crunchy! Pancakes nice and fluffy. We were given lots of TLC from our server. You feel so welcome and you feel like you have a good honest home cooked meal."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant recently on recommendations of friends. I wasn't that impressed. It was okay. I often go for breakfast with my mother and we go to the usual spots, Sunset, Symposium. This place was pretty similar. The good was fine, no complaints. But it was about $5 more than Sunset and not really worth it. It was okay. You can tell they have alot of regulars."}
{"text":"Bobby's is reliable and consistent. Portions are generous, service is good and the food is always good. Very popular for weekend brunch, lines are long but move along fairly well. 
Do try them for lunch as well, really tasty and large portioned sandwiches, really good club sandwich. Soups are good too, I tried the cheeseburger soup and it was literally a cheeseburger in soup form! Unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints. So glad it is next to home. Love the egg Benedict's and fresh orange juice. The omelette and pancakes are good as well. 
Their pancakes are fluffy and nice. Friendly and great staff. You might find parking an issue on weekends but there is a plaza across the street where you can park."}
{"text":"The best place to get a classic breakfast in Mississauga, I wouldn't go anywhere else even if there is a wait (and I'm impatient-I rarely will wait for a table!). I have been coming for over 6 years now, and the speediness of the service + great tasting food has never let me down. I'm amazed at how fast they always get the food out, even on days where it's exceptionally busy. Sometimes I feel like it comes out faster, as crazy as that is.

Their pancakes and home fries are DELICIOUS! I don't know what it is about them but they're really great. The only minor complaint I would have is that sometimes, if it does get crazy busy it might be a little bit hard to locate/get a hold of your server after your food has been dropped. But from one server to another, I understand and in all the years I've been going here, it's only happened a handful of times. The servers are always incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Don't come here. 
Bad Service! So rude. 
Tables not clean.  
Very slow service.  
Waiting too long for coffee and food.
I shouldn't walked out !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend first introduced me to this place....
I've only been here twice so far and for some reason I am always craving their breakfasts!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is great but...that's not what I ordered. Went here for breakfast and ordered food to go. The service was fast and I was able to grab breakfast before heading to my first meeting of the day. Except when I got to my destination, and unpacked the food, it wasn't the meal that I ordered. It's not a huge deal since I ordered french toast and was given pancakes. But I'll definitely verify my order next time."}
{"text":"Chaotic to get in on a Saturday. People are rude in the parking lot, and in the line to wait to get in. Simple suggestion to Bobby - just have a hostess dedicated to prioritizing seating. That will eliminate the rude behavior of some bad apples in the crowd. Unfortunately for this reason, it set a negative tone to the overall experience,and I had to give it less stars than what it should be.

Food was great. Service was great. Atmosphere was above average compared to the usual diners I hit. The pancakes were memorable. I saw another couple each having their own spicy Italian sausage. I plan to try that next if I can get there earlier or bear the crowds."}
{"text":"FOOD, SERVICE, ATMOSPHERE WAS EXCELLENT... an experience in and of itself being in a warm family friendly environment. Slight wait at the beginning but it was to be expected given their rating. Line went down quickly. No waiting list per say, & I liked how although we were last in line they came out to call 'table for two' and since it was just my wife & I we immediately got a table. GREAT ATMOSPHERE! Really enjoyed the very friend & attentive service by our server CIARA. Never lacked for anything and she was busy. A credit to excellent management I'm sure. The wait staff & team were tight! Another of the serving staff named JAKE also attended to us. Very friendly & efficient!  I ordered the delicious corn beef hash & my wife the ample Weekender plate.  Coffee was GREAT & the PANCAKES were superb! We left satisfied and looking towards our next visit!  We loved it! ~Rowland & Anita"}
{"text":"Such a delightful and welcomed upgrade from the restaurant that was here before Bobby's, this restaurant hosts friendly service, a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu of comfort foods and a relaxing, homey decor. 

I was very excited to find fried buffalo cauliflower bites on the app menu at Bobby's, it's my absolute favourite & they did not disappoint! Every dish that arrived at our table was a heaping portion, worth every penny. I ordered a Roast Beef Hot Hamburger which fresh veggies and fries and my date ordered a Veal Parm Sandwich with a side caesar and over a pound of muscles for an appetizer. 

The cost is 100% manageable for a family outing. I would recommend Bobby's to anyone in the area. My only complaint is that the french fries were typical flash frozen, dry and chalky. But this is an easily avoidable issue by ordering an alternative side; they have lots of options! 

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"A stand alone diner with its own lot around the building. We came on a Friday night and it's was half empty and there was plenty of parking and no wait.

The staff was nice but once it got busy our server was nowhere to be found. I ordered Eggs Benedict and home fries which was good but not as filling as I'd liked. The home fries tasted more like they were steamed instead of fried. Our kids liked their meals but my wife and I were not so impressed."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant for some time now, based on the number of positive Yelp reviews, and finally had the chance.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the food and service.  

At the table we ordered the Corned Beef Hash breakfast, the Deep Fried Chicken Dinner, and the Villa Vienna Schnitzel.  The corned beef hash tasted like it was from a can and not homemade.  The fried chicken was not like southern deep-fried chicken, as it was just pieces of boneless and skinless chicken that were breaded and fried, making the chicken dry.  In addition the breading was a bit bland.  The mash potatoes that accompanied the chicken were also bland, and the vegetables were very salty.  The schnitzel was not really pounded as flat as traditional schnitzel, so it was a bit thicker and tougher.  

The service was inconsistent.  The hostess who greeted us was friendly, but seated us across from the washroom (which did smell), even though the restaurant was half empty.  She did move us to a better location. 
The waitress was also friendly, but after the food was served, she was difficult to find, so we were waiting for a coffee refill, and I had to seek out another waitress when we were ready for the bill.  In addition, during our meal, one of the staff started vacuuming the neighbouring tables and around our table.  So, we could not find anyone when we wanted a coffee refill or the bill, but they were there to clean the floors, when we didn't."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place. Golden waffles served with bacon Ham or sausage with pure maple syrup. The best eggs benedict I have ever had and the servers are very friendly and super fast. Our girls 3 years age also loved the experience..."}
{"text":"Amazing place you must try it.....everything is good.  Be prepared to wait though they are so busy.  Service is top notch!  I live in the east end and sometimes go down there to breakfast."}
{"text":"Very popular brunch place in Streetsville! Be prepared to wait around 10 mins for a table if you go during peak times. Also parking might be a little difficult at times because the lot is tight. The food is pretty good and the portions are fair sized. I will mention that the steak is quite small for the price, so maybe try other things. Overall very satisfying!"}
{"text":"Love Bobby's .. have for years. Pretty sure our family has had everything on the menu. Home cooked meals at a reasonable price. People that have negative reviews are comparing this place to the KEG or something. Obviously you're at a diner lets not get excited here. The owner is always there and the staff have been there forever and get to know the regulars. Just a great place to come for a little bit of comfort food. All day breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast after an early arrival in Mississauga - Decent food, service was ok - nothing special but $27 w/ tip for breakfast at what is really just a diner. If it were more reasonable I would rate it higher but at the prices it's an \"A-Ok\""}
{"text":"The menu is simple....but they seem to have perfected simplicity. The fish and chips is exactly what you expect, nothing less and nothing more, but the tartar sauce (homemade i think) is fantastic. The coleslaw is delicious. The fries were okay. 
I love the location, I love the theme, and I love the decor. I will be back."}
{"text":"Bobby's is great. It's a very cozy, comfortable, and welcoming atmosphere. It's got all day breakfast and some great lunch/dinner options too. There's really no legitimate reason to not like this place."}
{"text":"Not only did this place have terrible food, it also creeped me the hell out. Honestly, I've never felt uncomfortable at a restaurant, but here I felt really out of place. It's like the kind of place where old retired white men go to for brunch with their wives after they've played some amateur golf. It has that small-town feel where everyone knows everyone, but NOT in a good way. But anyway, enough about the atmosphere; I ordered the Eggs Benedict, and it was AWFUL!!! Honestly, why would I pay $30 for that pitiful plate when I could make it just as horribly in my own home? And the potatoes were straight-up gross."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. The homefries are the one downfall but everything else is wonderful. Great service. Good portions."}
{"text":"Came here early morning after a night of drinking. I was told about this place from a few coworkers so I was a bit excited to try this place out. 

Service was average, got seated and orders taken promptly. Food took a bit long considering what we ordered and the amount of people. The bill is what took the longest to arrive but still ok. 

Food was the big disappointment. I got the steak and eggs med rare. Steak was highly over cooked and lacked any seasoning whatsoever. Eggs were eggs and my potatoes were cold. 

Wife did enjoy the pancakes. To me they were under cooked."}
{"text":"The boyfriend & I were looking for a different place for Sunday brunch & while Googling, this came up as highly recommended for places in Mississauga. Since the boyfriend already lives in Streetsville, it was a convenient place to go to. 

We called ahead since other reviews said to come in early for line ups. I called in at 11:45am & the guy who answered said there was barely a wait. 

We got there a little after 12:00pm & there was a bit of a wait, but they quickly sat smaller groups. 

The server we got was friendly & informative. She was prompt & attentive, giving us water without having to ask. 

I ordered the steak & eggs, the boyfriend ordered The Weekender. Both were large servings. My steak looked a lot fuller than 6oz, it wasn't like other breakfast/brunch places who serve steak & eggs where the steak is a flat dry piece of meat. The breakfast potatoes were AMAZING. 

As for my boyfriend's order, he had pancakes which were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. They were good with or without maple syrup. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for brunch. I don't think it's overpriced & the service is really good. 

For the both of us it came up to $40 after tip - not bad considering what we ordered. In fact, I thought the bill was going to be more. 

My only qualm is how customers have to wait to be seated; they weren't giving out numbers or taking names... If this is how it is with larger crowds, they need a system.

Other than that, I think I found a new place for brunch."}
{"text":"When I arrived I noticed the interesting and nice decor.  Kind of a unique place with nice atmosphere.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The food was average, with portions being mediocre.  We had steak and eggs and Italian sausage plate.  Relatively expensive for what you get.  $15 for eggs, potatoes and sausage with it not being much different than if I made it at home.  It is a nice place to visit to try out, but would not come regularly as the value is not there.  It is one of the better brunch places to visit in sauga though."}
{"text":"Bobby's is a pretty sweet little breakfast diner in Streetsville. We went around 1pm, so were seated right away, though I've heard there's usually a bit of a wait. The parking lot is kind of funky - I'd recommend going later only because it was a mess at 1 and I can't imagine what it's like earlier on when they're packed! 
Bobby's is what you expect from a diner - usual assortment of breakfast eats, big portions, friendly but not harassing waitresses. We also got our food pretty fast and piping hot! 
I appreciated that while the server wasn't quite sure what contained gluten in general, she did know that the spice that the homefries were coated in wasn't safe and I was able to get plain homefries instead. This is rare as I usually have to completely forgo them. I also got tomatoes instead of toast which was nice :) 
Wasn't a huge fan of my omelette. I got the Spanish omelette which came with salsa, green peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. The omelette was folded over the filling rather than it being mixed into the eggs. Really my only qualm. It was HUGE and I'm pretty sure was at least three eggs if not more. 
Friends ordered waffles, French toast, pancakes, poached eggs - everyone was satisfied. 
Prices were decent. About $12 for a meal and almost all of the orders included coffee/tea which was a nice touch 
I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"What a shame! I was hoping this could be another good go-to breakfast place. We've been here twice. Once on a Saturday and once on a Sunday and it was consistently poor service. The food was so-so but the service was bad the first time and terrible the second time. On both visits, the waitresses took over 10 minutes to take our drink orders (and once, i had to insist that they do so.) On our recent visit, the waitress was rude to our table over and over and made us feel very uncomfortable. She became openly irritated and short when we simply asked questions about the menu items. It wasn't even busy but she was behaving like she had no time for our table and she was in a rush to run off. And because of her haste and failure to properly explain the menu, i ended up with meat on my plate and I'm a vegetarian. Thankfully, it was pointed out as my meal arrived  She then announced to our 4 and 5 year old daughters that my wife is going to get FAT because she ordered too much food! Seriously! Who says that??! The seats were dirty which caused my daughter to get jam all over her nice clothes. The coffee refills were not prompt. We ordered vinaigrette dressing but got some creamy dressing instead. Napkins had to be requested 3 times. The bill was wrong. The overall experience was poor. Some better breakfast options in Mississauga are Sunset Grill, Muddy Duck or Orchard Restaurant. We will not be returning to Bobby's Hideaway."}
{"text":"Greasy doner food. Great if your hung over. The srvice is pretty shotty, but its probably because the place is consistantly packed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've ever been to. Lineups out the door- and for a good reason. Amazing fast service- I mean 5 minutes and all your food is ready. And it's ALWAYS delicious and cooked perfectly. Not to mention really reasonable prices. Highly recommended :) I'd drive half an hour to have breakfast at this place- nothing else compares. I think this is my first ever restaurant review! Bobby's deserves it."}
{"text":"We do love a weekend breakfast place. This was a first time visit for my boyfriend, but I went there many times when I lived in the area. 
The menu is pretty good, plenty to choose from but nothing that really stands out as unique. I ordered the pea meal bacon and he ordered the bacon, eggs and pancakes. Overall, the taste was pretty good but everything seemed to be swimming in grease. I understand the concept of a 'greasy spoon', and grease is needed to make breakfast the best meal of the day. But Bobbys seemed to have an excessive amount the day we went.

I personally prefer their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Glad Bobby's has made its way to South Mississauga!
We went within the first few weeks of it being open for one of their classic breakfasts. Meal was consistent with what we expect from Bobby's. In fact, slightly less greasy than its Streetsville counterpart.

We had a seat that looked directly into the kitchen, and while normally that would be a bad thing, I liked it this time. I could see that they had a very clean kitchen and everything was handled properly.

Only negative, and it is a minor one, it is a very tight area. Seats and tables crammed together. The entrance is petite and you feel as though you are standing on top of people. Go early and beat the rush!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast place, but crowded so expect wait time to be seated.  However, worth it"}
{"text":"It's okay. Went on the past Sunday. Ordered eggs Benny and CBT (cheese bacon tomatoe) on rye. Expected the cheese to be melted but it was coke on toast with tomatoe and that's it. Home fries are mediocre. Not seasoned enough. Eggs Benny was pretty good. Service was okay. Will be back to try again another time but probably wit order the same things.

{"text":"I went there with a girlfriend today and as always, the food was fresh and delicious!  I always order the eggs benedict. The staff is friendly and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Since I am a sucker for good All Day breakfast food I had read the reviews on this place and booked marked it so I would give it a try. I was expecting it to be as good as the reviews. The service was Great, coffee very fresh even though it was about 2 or so. 
I ordered the Eggs Benedict as that is my favourite, but unfortunately I didn't think it was that good. I didn't like the sauce, the way the eggs were poached and thought the home fries were too greasy."}
{"text":"I forgot to review this restaurany when I got take out from here last week!! OOooOoOhh.. The Eggs Florentine was delicious!! I got sausage on the side and everyhing tasted delicious.. even though I didn't get to sit in and eat, the lady packed exyra utensils, ketchup, mayo and even gave me Extra Hollandaise sauce as I asked for it! Packed very nicely and I knew everything was fresh, I'd come here for breakfast again, that's for sure. I recommened this place for breakfast, try it!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for breakfast/brunch. It's a quaint, little diner-like spot with all the breakfast essentials. Food is good, service is pretty good and it's always great to support a local spot. Plenty of seating but parking spots are very limited. Weekends in the summer this place fills up and sometimes there can be a line up.  Overall it's pretty decent, I'd return again for some breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute staple in Streetsville - I've probably been here 20 times. All of the servers are incredible, the food comes quickly, and the quality is always great! There's almost always a wait, but because they're so quick in the kitchen, it never has taken me more than 20-30 minutes to get a table. The food is classic diner food, but with a lot of other options, and they do dinner as well."}
{"text":"Ok this is another place that if you order things separately to save money, they're gonna f@ck you any way. Side of 3 eggs, toast, coffee was $10.80! What!? 
And they have no internet, this is getting ridiculous, so far the majority of breakfast joints in Mississauga have no wifi?  The must have really old owners. I posted my bill in the photo section."}
{"text":"I had a car appointment in the area so my boyfriend and I decided to come here for breakfast! We were seated within a few minutes.

My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict and I got the corned beef hash breakfast. Both came with either tea or coffee and I believe no more than $16. We were so hunger and luckily for us the food arrived so quickly! My corned beef hash was so tasty and well made. The sauce on my boyfriend's eggs Benedict was separating so you know they make the sauce from scratch.

Definitely recommend this place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Wished they opened earlier actually, my morning train is at 7:40am at the Streetsville GO Station and they open at 7. So it wouldn't be a slow, enjoyable breakfast on the weekday.... Just a quick eat then pack the leftovers!

They have large large portions of breakfast foods. The ham is big and thick, eggs are only decent (they're the average/small ones at grocery stores), the potatoes were alright, and most dishes come with a coffee/tea. Lots of the food and drink is just ordinary, but still a very big, hearty breakfast cooked with love. 

The service is pretty good, she looked mean when we came in (haha) but she's a very nice lady. 

For the price... hmm... it's quite expensive. Be sure to order what you CAN EAT, don't go for the large deals with lots of food, and you don't even finish it!!! (I'm pointing at myself) My plate lasted two breakfasts."}
