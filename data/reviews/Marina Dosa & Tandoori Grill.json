{"text":"The food here is pretty good. But, the customer service is probably the worst I have encountered in Calgary. First off, make sure you have 2-3 hours for your meal. Second, don't expect any answers for where the menus are, how much longer your meal will take etc. The only response is \"it's on it's way\" 30 min later, there are your menus. Chennai Spice is a 2 min drive away and has superior prices, food and customer service. Don't waste your time at Marina Dosa."}
{"text":"We were driving back from Banff and beyond after a four day trip. After a two and half hour drive, we decided to eat at a restaurant that serves South Indian food. We finally found this place but were warned that there will be a 20 minute wait. It was worth!

As some other reviewer said, the Sambar was outstanding. So were the Dosas. My family had Sambar Idli, Kotthu Parotta, Plain and Marina Masala Dosa and Poori Masala. All of them were really good.  I met the owner Satish who runs the place with his brother. He was very friendly.

I will highly recommend this place to anyone that visits the Calgary area and are looking for some good South Indian food. BTW - they do have lot of North Indian and Indo-Chinese items too which we generally like but we decided to go South Indian.

Visiting from the San Francisco Bay Area, my wife and I can say that this place is way better than many other South Indian restaurants there! For a small place, the ambience and furniture was very good. So were the cutlery and serving dishes something you don't see in the Bay Area restaurants."}
{"text":"Everytime i had their sambar, rice or gravies, i used to feel heavy which i never realised until a friend of mine got sick after having food from this restuarant and we realised they are mixing up something which will make you feel heavy on less quantity which is harmful for your system. Their food taste is ok but harmful for health and the service is bad, their water glasses stink, washroom is shady. We avoid this Restuarant !"}
{"text":"The service was horrible (waited over 45 mins despite not being that busy) and the food was worse. To be fair, the idli and dosa tasted ok, however, the sambar was sweet (not authentic), and the chutneys were bland. I ordered the 'signature' saag paneer dosa, and it was barely green! Where did the saag/spinach go?"}
{"text":"The food was really good and everyone in our party of 6 enjoyed it. Only reason why I gave it 4 stars was the Dosa was pretty salty. But even with that I would go back, good portions and very well priced. If you don't know what to get, the combo is the best bet."}
{"text":"Decent food, TERRIBLE service! The hospitality at Marina makes the Good taste bad. I went to get takeout and the server (who doubled as the cashier) started serving sit-down customers who arrived street me! As he started to taste my order he stopped to answer a personal call. 

I figured the food might be worth it. The server said to return in 15 minutes. When I came back the did still wasn't ready and took an extra 10 mins. I regret not leaving after the initial signs of bad service. Attempt at your own risk."}
{"text":"I really only bother reviewing places if they're awesome or horrible, and this place is fantastic.
My boyfriend and I eat here quite frequently and they have absolutely fantastic food.
The Chilli Idly here might be the best thing to eat, anywhere, and they have coke in glass bottles which is also really good with their food.
Only drawbacks are that there isn't much seating and sometimes it's quite busy in there, and also sometimes it takes a bit to get the food also due to how busy they are. (and sometimes they're fast).
For us, it's MORE THAN worth the wait though, even when they're a bit slow - both because we're not in a rush generally, and the food is so delicious. We try to go here at least a couple times a week even though it's on the other side of town."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place but only in the beginning. The seating and wait time has killed the experience for me. Food is really good. However, the restaurant is like canteen. Super slow service and not so warm people. There is no waiting area and the main door is like a grocery shop. You have to eat the food with your winter Parka on as the freezing wind comes inside as soon as somebody opens the main door. Its really bad for the Big group( more than 4 people) as there is no proper seating. You feel bad to see the other people waiting outside in the chilly winter and try to eat as quickly as possible after getting the food in almost 50 minutes."}
{"text":"I'd like to review this place based on the food and service, unfortunately I never got to taste any the food and the service was atrocious.
Was quoted an hour and it took 2 hours for the food to arrive (the restaurant is a 5 minute drive away) when it finally showed up the guy was requesting cash though we only had credit/debit and we never once discussed payment options on the phone. We didn't have the cash so we sent it back. The food might be good in store but DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of Indian food, however went here with a couple girlfriends to try something new and it was delicious. They take pride in what they cook and it shows! 

Will be back !"}
{"text":"One of the best South Indian restaurant in Calgary.  

The entire kitchen staff are from Chennai/Madras.  Their South Indian dishes are quite authentic.  

Idli's are fluffy and light.  

Best deal on the menu is their combo Thalis ($12 for non-veg; $11 for veg). 

Madras coffee is also very good.

Front restaurant staff is bit slow.  Only 7 tables.  The restaurant appears built as standard Indian take out.  Can be slightly unpleasant when specially cold outside."}
{"text":"This place is the best Southern Indian place in Calgary. It is located is a strangely industrial part of town, but don't let this fool you. It is a prime dining spot, regardless of the location. Now, few things about the place. 

1. Serves meat, fish, and veggie dishes. All dishes are fresh and high quality  (your chutney will have fresh mint and cilantro in it). 

2. Vegans/VEgetarians--since it is a Southern Indian place, there is an amazing selection of dishes, and most of them can be made vegan. I had probably the best Dosa and Chickpea dish!

3. Meat and fish eaters--you will not be left out. the majority of menu is non-vegetarian and dishes include baked fish, lamb, butter chicken, and even lobster items. 

4. Prices--they are relatively low as the portions are not skimpy. I saw a comment by another reviewer suggesting that the prices are \"too high for the east side\" WtF? Would you expect restaurants on the east side to want to make less money than the restaurants in, I don't know, west Calgary? Prices are 9.99-11.99 for a vegetarian dish, 11-13.99 for meet, and up to 15.99 for a lobster item. Considering the quality of ingredients I found it very reasonable. 

5. Ambience/General--it is a nice place with dark red walls and cosy atmosphere. They don't sell alcohol (they are pretty new), but you can bring your own. Service is very nice and helpful. The place is primarily set for lunch (sells lunchboxes etc), but they are open for dinners too. Food can be ordered though JustEat. 

Definitely te keeper!"}
{"text":"Good dosa though sambar and chutney not as good.
Little concerning hygiene situation."}
{"text":"We are here since we were staying overnight at hotel close to Calgary airport. Plain and Rava masala Dosa were top notch, though sambar was spicy for me."}
{"text":"Excellent service the food was authentic fresh and tasty. It a small place so we had to wait for a table and it was worth it. We had RASAM VADA soup was very tasty, the best ALOO TIKKI CHOLLE I have ever eaten and chicken dosa huge & delicious. It's a must try we be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Dishes have great flavors but a bit overpriced for the amt of protein they give you in the two chicken and lamb items we had. However, competitive with other Indian restaurants. Not sure why this type of cuisine is more expensive than western or Mediterranean food. Everything on the menu is a la carte. Not a fan of the restaurant atmosphere, cold, uninviting, cramped as a lot of ppl line up standing next to your table for takeout. I would recommend takeout for sure. I do enjoy the food, as it is quite authentic. Would return."}
{"text":"Service is really slow. The lady at the front, who owns the place I believe, shows more interest in serving large groups than two tops. The dosa batter tastes sour and food is not piping hot. Any consolation, their location is good."}
{"text":"That was amazing. I had the butter chicken dosa. Easily one of the best butter chicken gravies I've ever eaten, mixed into a delicious dosa. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the city for some authentic South Indian food. All the masala dosas are great, and the biriyani is a dream. Large portions for good prices! :)"}
{"text":"My family and I were left wanting to vomit by the end of the meal. Not because it was disgusting, but because it was so delicious we couldn't waste a single bite of it!!

We ordered the non veg dosa combo. It.was.amazing.
There was just so many little bowls to try and every single dish had its own distinct and delightful flavor. 

3 hours later and none of us have that heavy feeling or gassy burps. Because indian food tends to do that.

My sister described it like this: my tummy is so happy right now, I just don't want to ever poop it out because it's so yummy and I want to stay like this forever.

TMI? .....at least I'm honest."}
{"text":"This place is just right across the road from real canadian superstore at Mcknight.
Passed by this place many a times but never got a chance to taste until last week. 
Food that we ordered was fresh and tasty. We tried garlic naan,chicken naan. Garlic naan was pretty soft . 
The prices were just moderate. Seems like recently they have reduced their pirces.The curries that were served were very less in quantity. Service was good and quick. But the place was very small. I don't think it can handle even 20 at a time.

Few items were little costly . Because in NE we do expect the cheaper prices for Indian food.

They serve lunch buffet here during afternoons ( not sure on weekdays). 

There are other items on menu like samosa,biryani(chicken,lamb and prawn too).
Also they have few sweets available here."}
{"text":"Yes this is a dosa specialty restaurant/hole in the wall - will get to it in a bit. 

BUT wonderful yelpers you have to try the channa bhatura it is quite good, a solid 8/10.

As for the dosa they are good and for the price cannot go wrong. Definitely worth trying at least once!

Service - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Ambience - 3/5
Authenticity - 4.5/5

Dont mind the service just wave down the staff if you need something.

Also I have tried some of their non-vegetarian dishes/curries and they are okay. Would recommend sticking with the dosa. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dosas are awesome here. Authentic South Indian cuisine. Loved the chutney sambhar and dosas"}
{"text":"Safely just an Average Dosa place. Service was also not upto the mark. Decor needs to be improved significantly plus it's a costly place. 

Not an authentic south Indian dosa place. Only the cup used was of Filter coffee but the coffee inside was Instant coffee (look up on the web for the difference). 

A take out pickup person left frustrated after waiting for 30 plus minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible service and stale food. My husband and I were so excited to eat there. We ordered our food and started our wait. 40 minutes in and no food showed up. There was no food on anyone else's table! Finally when the thali I ordered reached my table, the potato filling of the dosa had gone stale. I understand restaurants can have bad service and bad tasting food, happens here and there; but who serves STALE food!!! Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"I googled dosa, as I was craving one, so I ended up at Marina Dosa and Tandoori Grill. I was greeted and sat solo, ordered a masala paper dosa, Dosa(a thin crispy crape made from rice batter and black lentils) it came with sambar(lentil based veggie stew) and coconut chutney. This is a favorite South Indian dish. I am definitely going to come back to try some other items on the menu, looked very interesting. My first experience was great, do give a Dosa a try If you haven't tried before."}
{"text":"Best South Indian dosa ever, will go back. highly recommended"}
{"text":"The best, best best.  Been coming here a few years.  Awesome food.  Not quick, but worth the wait.  Ignore any of the bad reviews, awesome."}
{"text":"The sambar tastes good which in turn makes all the dosa/vada/idly taste good with sambar as side. Portion size is ample. Very much recommended place.
They have to expand the place or hire more people(sous-chef/serving staff) to speed up the serving process and accommodate more guests.
There is always wait time if you go for dinner."}
{"text":"The best South Indian Restuarant !!! No restaurants in Toronto would match to chilli Idli that they make here (close to the ones I tried in India ) 
I loved sambhar idli !!!! It was amazing !!!
The price was very reasonable and cheap !!
You guys got to try it ! 
One draw back they were completely full packed ... So I had to wait to try this place out . Worth the wait !! Completely good food !!!!! 
I had to use exclamation on every sentence because I finally found a good perfect South Indian Restuarant . 
I would travel once a month from Edmonton to Calgary just for this Restuarant."}
{"text":"They have great food and the staff is great. Only complain I had was the wait time after order (25-30 mins). 

Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely a hidden gem, the methu vada and idli were amazing for an appetizer. The Masala Dosa and kotu Paratha had the perfect amount of spice. One of the best south Indian spots in the city.

One downfall was that the restaurant is a bit small and they really need to fix the entrance door if they haven't already (you really need to pull hard to yank the thing open!)."}
{"text":"Eating here is like having an Indian parent in the kitchen who is a great cook.  As others have noted, just a few tables, and service can be slow, but it is worth it.  Onion dosa was delicious, biryani was good and chicken tikka masala was also great.  Delicious Naan and Dahl.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"There are lots of Indian restaurants in Calgary downtown but I was dragged all the way to McNight station, just to eat at Marina. And I must say the trips (well more than once now) have been fulfilling.

Marina has a comprehensive menu offering south Indian delights as well as traditional north Indian curries.

I have enjoyed their idli, medu vadas, dosas, aloo tikki chaat, lamb curry and chapatis. However, the potato masala in dosas, okhra and daal left a lot to be desired. I guess Toronto offers so many good options which may have spoilt me a bit. Or maybe I need to try other joints in Calgary before declaring that this is the best Indian food this city has to offer.

As for service, for an economical dinner, it's pretty good and they are very accommodating to requests. So full points there.

If you are in the neighbourhood, it definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Really bad customer service at this restaurant. I ordered a veggie combo and the server says \"sorry the kitchen is too busy to make a vegie combo.\" Why is it on your menu then? So I order plain dosa, fish tikka, chole samosa and asked the server to bring out the samosa first before the main meals. Doesn't do that either. Brought samosa and the plain dosa. Ate appetizer while my partner finished his meal. 20 minutes later I ask how long my fish is Going to be. The lady says shortly. Brings out fish and the fish is cold from inside and my whole plate is filled with water. I take it back and the lady at the front starts arguing with me. People need to be taught customer service skills before opening up a restaurant,."}
