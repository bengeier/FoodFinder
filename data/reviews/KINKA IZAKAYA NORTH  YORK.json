{"text":"Food was amazing, disappointed a bit that they were missing a couple of options in the menu that their original location offers. For an anniversary dinner it was great choice."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service, glad they opened up at this location! The oyster is always a treat, so is the sushi, and make sure to always combine with sake :) very tasty experience"}
{"text":"So I started writing this review back in Aug 2015, a week after my visit, when it was still called Guu, and forgot about it. So finishing it now...   I had been to the Church St location before and loved it, so was excited when my friend suggested we come try this location. The 3 of us came on a Sat. We didn't have a reservation, but walked in around 8pm to see if we could get a table anyways. We were told there would be a 45min wait. We gave them our number, and they said they would text us when our table was ready, and hold the table for 10mins. Within 10mins, we were called back, so the wait wasn't bad. We were originally told there was a 2hr seating limit when we gave them our number, but when we were being seated the hostess informed us that we only had a bit over an 1hr to eat since there was a reservation for our table afterwards. That was enough time for us, since we weren't planning to drink, but we felt slightly hurried to order and eat, since we didn't know how long it would take the food to come out.    It was pretty loud in there, making it hard to order. We just pointed at a few things, and hoped they got our order right. We ended up ordering 8 items. They came out 2 or 3 at a time, with about 10mins between each time they brought out food. It was a food pace, our table was never jammed packed with food.  We ordered: (in order we received)  ~Salmon Tataki (Seared Atlantic Salmon Sashimi w/ Ponzu, Wasabi Mayo & Garilic Chips) [$7.8] - The combination of everyting went together well, it was good. Would order again ~Kurage (Marinated Jellyfish) [$5.5] - Like a jellyfish salad, with some sharkfin (not sure if real), cucumber, sesame, and some lettuce at the bottom. Really liked the overall texture and the lightly marinated jellyfish. Would order again.    ~Ikapiri (Deep fried Calamari w/ Spicy Ketchup & Wasabi Mayo) [$7.5] - This was just ok, didn't really like how the sauce made the calamari slightly soggy and kind of stick together. Might have liked it more if the sauce was on the side. Would skip this next time. ~Karaage (Deep Fried Soy Sauce Marinated Chicken w/ Garlic Mayo) [$7.8] - My friends loved this, very crispy and still quite juicy. Would order again. ~Brie Cheese (Deep Fried Brie Cheese w/ Mango Sauce & Berry Sauce) [$7.5] - My fav since I love cheese! The outside was nice and crunchy, the inside was all gooey, melt-y, cheesy goodness. Sauce went well with it. Ordered it before at the Church location and still love it here. Definitely would order again.    ~Unagi Bibimbap (Rice, BBQ Water Eel, Burdock & Egg in Sizzling Stone Bowl) [$11.3] - Flavour was good. Was hoping for more crispy rice bits since it was served in a sizzling stone bowl, but still good. Would order again. ~Gindara (Grilled Miso Marinated Black Cod w/ Yuzu Miso Sauce) [$12.8] - Ordered this before at the Church location and loved it. But this time the miso sauce was way too overpowering, and so salty. It came 10mins after our rice, and I wish I could of had some rice leftover to eat with it. The texture of the cod was grilled just right though. Hope it was a one time thing.  ~Salmon Oshizushi (Blowtorched Atlantic Salmon Pressed Sushi) [$12.8] - This was slightly bland in flavour. Or because we got it at the same time as the cod, so it just tasted bland by comparison. Would probably try the saba oshizushi next time instead.  Service was pretty good here. Place was clean. Washrooms are well equipped, with even mouthwash and female hygiene products. This location didn't feel as crowded as the Church location. It's also a more convenient location, There is a $6 Parking at the Hallmark Centre (also where Wholefood is located) from 6pm-6am, which is pretty reasonable is you're not familiar with the area and don't want to go around looking for parking. My friends and I will definitely be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya is on to something. My generation hates missing out, and small plates are the perfect way to experience it all. The food is amazing and comes out fast, so there are no complaints there. You can find safe well-known options and even a few more adventurous menu items. The cocktails and drink list is especially impressive, given that there is not much of a premium for imported beer items.  The reason they don't get a full score with me is that they kept trying to force us to share a table with other people, even though open tables existed and remained open for the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"Very convenient that we don't have to go all the way down to the original for our GUU fix. although this one does not have everything the original does ( I miss the green salad) . I have to admit this place is much less hectic and crowded with more space but it is still really fun. The food was about 80% as good as the original. I did notice certain things were not done as well maybe slightly overcooked.  Bonus for a patio but phone and check if it is opened before.  I also think they are a bit nicer and more accommodating here. Last time at the original the service wasn't so great"}
{"text":"it's too loud to enjoy anything. at first the loudness seems like a unique offering, but after 5 minutes sitting there, i want to get out of the restaurant. the food is fair. some dishes such as the octopus with wasabi was a good pick."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for drinks and dinner! Love the staff greetings and how the atmosphere is full of energy. My favourite is the salmon oshizushi, which is a blow torched Atlantic salmon pressed sushi. The takowasabi octopus and the saba grilled mackerel are also really good!"}
{"text":"Tried the KINKALICIOUS with some friends at the patio on a weekday.  Food - Fresh and comes with the exact variety as advertised.  Drinks - We ordered the sake special and requested it to be served as hot which was delivered as requested.  Service - A bit of a slow start as we had a hard time getting their attention. However, once we ordered our food, service was quite smooth and food was being served at a reasonable pace.   I would come back again to snack on the variety of fresh food items and drink specials. The overall experience was decent but it didn't stand out to be amazing."}
{"text":"Place is top small but great service and awesome sushi. Was here for a friends birthday .They have birthday special menu as well. Its expensive but its worth it."}
{"text":"This is the closest restaurant to my house. That becomes my food court. Their pan fried udon is the best I ever had. I love this location because I tried other kinka locations. They don't have the sweet shirmp. Only this location has it. Best sashimi I had . The place is very modern and clean. Staffs are very friendly and they are full of energy. But sometimes just a little bit too loud.   Here is a little tip. Parking in yonge st is always super annoying. I highly recommend to take subway their since it's right at the subway entrance. You can only park after 6pm or weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent service and just like I remember the original Guu.... a fun and friendly, unique experience. Every dish we had was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love Kinka!! It is one of my favourite izakaya restaurants in Toronto. I love the ambience, their warm greetings, and most importantly their food! The baked oysters are to die for, baked with mushroom, mayo sauce, and cheese. Their salmon torched sushi are amazing as well. Kinka Izakaya really embraces the Japanese culture and food. Best part is, the food is not too expensive. A meal that fills 2 people was around $50-60. Great food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Brighter lighting than the other izakayas I've been to. Apparently all the guus have been changed to kinka izakaya. Very loud environment that may take some time to get used to if it's your first time here!  We were a party of 3 on a Saturday night. Didn't think we needed to make a reservation, but the place was packed and waited about an hour. That was okay, and we were seated at the bar area. I liked it actually, being able to see the food being made, which then they would hand right over to us.   The eel hot pot dish was the highlight of the evening! We also ordered karaage (fried chicken), takoyaki, tataki and a scallop dish (I forget the name). Great food and service here, despite it being so busy.   Next time, I'll remember to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Every thing is pretty good except the waiting timr for the food ... We went as a group of 4 and we ordered around 10 dishes (rmb they are really small snacking size) we waited 20 mins then we had 3 dishes ... Then 30 mins for the next 3 dishes ... Then another 30 mins for the next 3 dishes ... We werr quite hungry at that time  but otherwise you their food is very nice !! A must try is their octopus appetizer (if you love spicy food) ... Their waygu onigiri"}
{"text":"food was great! especially their grilled squid. we ordered a bunch of stuff too. i forgot what they called them but we got the mushrooms and some fish which were their specials of the day. we also got the fried quail. server was really nice too and i like their set up."}
{"text":"Hardly to communicate with staff as they don't speak fluently in English .  One of the server accidentally spilled a glass of something into my friend body and nothing was offer .  Luckily the drink was not hot and also the drink spilled into the dishes , server did not offer to change our dishes .  Plus dishes side were very small.  Bad management ........We won't go back ."}
{"text":"Ive been to the Guu on church i wasn't  too wild about it however i think this one is better. (same owners i believe)   things i tried.   Yellow fin tuna sashimi 10/10 - Delicious and fresh  Japanese scalop sashimi 10/10 - sweet fresh and great texture.  argentinian red prawn sashimi 6/10 - My girlfriend got creeped out because it came with the head on (rest of shell removed). Taste was okay but had a but of a strange after taste. I think i just prefer my prawns cooked.  Oyster rockafeller 8/10 (their version, called something else..) Very very good. Comes 2 huge oysters, much better than the one i had on church st.   unagi bim bap 8/10 - very fresh they mix up the egg in the hot stone bowl at your table.   Pork belly 6/10 for got the name but it was not really what i was expecting, a bit lacking in flavour too but its pork belly so hard to be terrible...   Green Matcha cheesecake 7/10 - Nice ny style cheesecake with the Japanese twist. I still prefer the original thing but this was quite good.   What i found a bit annoying about this place is that none of the seats have back rests. and most of them dont have cushions either. There is one long bench at the back that has a back rest and also cushions... Also its a bit loud but if you've ever been to guu or the other izakaya places around toronto you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service wasn't the greatest and it was Loud! Deafening. It's amazing how they don't damage their vocal cords yelling like that during their entire shift. But fun atmosphere and great location if you are in North York. Nice interior too."}
{"text":"Called in to place an advanced take out order a few weeks ago. Picked up and no issues. Called in tonight to do the same, Anna the supervisor says has to walk in and place the order in person. Then abruptly hangs up. Terrible, lost my business."}
{"text":"I've been to kinka (guu) before but this was the first time I came for lunch. I was very excited that now I could come here for lunch. But I'm warning you now if you don't have the time to spare then go somewhere else. So kinka opens for lunch at 11:30 I got there at 12 and was seated promptly. My friend and I ordered soon after. She got the ramen and I got the kaisen don (sushi on rice). Surprisingly her ramen was the last order that day. I don't quite understand how that can be when the restaurant just opened and it wasn't even full. But anyways we waited 45 mins and we finally got something, her ramen. Presentation was as it should be and portion was big compared to others. I didn't try it so can't say much on taste. Then I waited 10 mins still no sushi on rice in sight. I spoke to the waiter he said kitchen is backed up. Then I waited another 10 mins and told the waiter I'm done. Cancel my order because it doesn't make sense why mine would take this long to make and by this time my friend was pretty much done her meal. Their reasoning: lunch hours is new so they're still working on it (well tell people so they can decide if they want to commit an hour wait for food), her ramen was faster because someone else ordered it and left because it was taking too long (other people walked out) last I can't cancel it because they're \"making it\" (which at this point I know it wasn't true). So I  watched them and I saw the head chef make eye contact with my table and walk into the kitchen and then i knew he was making it. And finally after more than an hour my food came. I must say it is not worth an hour wait but it was still delicious. Which is why I still give them 3 stars. If I could I would give 2.5 stars because to me service is a big part of my dining experience. And they did not deliver in service. The sushi on rice had some salmon, tuna, surf clam and a giant sweet shrimp on top of perfectly cooked rice. It was really good but I just wish I didn't have to wait over an hour for it."}
{"text":"I had been to this location a few years ago when it was still Guu and really had no desire to return as there are many Izakaya restaurants in the area with far more superior food options. However, my SO had never been and wanted to check out their patio. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by the kitchen staff and waited about 15 mins until the hosted greeted us with a \"yes?\". She had quite the bitter/negative determiner and advised us the patio would be a 40 min wait and that the empty tables were reserved. Not a big deal, so we got a few drinks at the bar as we waited. Close to the 50 min mark, we continued to see people come and go from the patio (assuming they had resos) but there always seemed to be tables available. Since no one gave us an update, we checked with the gentleman who brought our drinks, who then asked the hostess about the patio. She loudly (mind you we are right beside them), told him that MAYBE they can get a patio table. We waited longer and ordered an app since we were starting to feel the hunger. A whole lot of drinks later, it was clear she had no intention of providing us with the patio seating..... All in all, the patio looks beautiful, service needs improvement, and the food was actually better when it was Guu.. which is surprising since the menu is almost identical."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this restaurant. Food was ok but not worth the price. This place is not for me. When someone walks in the door, the staff yells and greets you in their own language I guess. Too loud and you will be seated in one table with other people. Not comfortable environment to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday and ordered a unagi bibimbap and a okra tempura.  The unagi bibimbap was way too sweet.  I think they put too much sugar or syrup in the dish.  The okra tempura is even more disappointing.  The batter is really thick, and contained uncooked batter on the inside because it was so thick.  Definitely recommend going elsewhere for decent Japanese food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Seriously one of the rudest servers I've ever encountered. Also the place is over crowded and over staffed and this creates chaos. Lots of noise, fights over seats, wrong orders get dropped at your table, service is slow and once you get the bill you just don't feel like the effort was worth it because the food wasn't great. Also to earn more they stuffed in seats of 60 into a shop the size of a Starbucks shop, people are literally hitting you with their elbows and bags while you're eating dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered for eight people, everything was great until we started wondering about our udon. After asking the staff to follow up twice, the three bowls of noodles finally arrived. We were not pleased because the udon were 42 minutes apart from the first dish that arrived. Although the staff didn't do anything about it, after complaining to the manager, she offered to remove the items from our bill. She even went the extra mile to offer free desserts and brought us a big pot of green tea. We really appreciate the great service; however, 42 minutes is a serious problem because imagine there's only the two of you, your food arrives, your friend's food arrives 42 minutes later...."}
{"text":"Definitely different atmosphere than the Guu restaurants I went to and loved in Vancouver.  I hadn't gone to the ones in Toronto before.  The quality of the food is how I remember the Guu's in Vancouver.  Mostly ate the sashimi this time, as my guest didn't want to sample the cooked foods.    The food was a noticeable step up over the Chinese/Korean izakaya that have popped up also in the city.  The quality of the beef tataki especially.    I'd love to go back to sample more on the menu, but definitely appreciate the quality over the quantity.  It's not a place you go to eat until you're full ($$$)."}
{"text":"Environment is amazing. How often do you get to say you had fun at a restaurant? Have to try the sake bombs. Adds to the fun. Staff are so awesome. One wore a red wig and clanged onto a pan. Loll. Also, food is delish. I try to order things you don't normally find at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Totally awesome. Top notch food and service. I don't even typically enjoy japanese food. Cute little share style dishes that a delicious and a super friendly staff.  They even have a family bathroom if you bring any little ones (I didn't see any high chairs though but i might have missed them). Definitely can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Guu's North York location doesn't disappoint. Same great food and amazing service!  We don't need to head downtown for our Izakaya fix anymore!"}
{"text":"I went to this location before grand opening. The food & service is just as good as their location on Church St. There is more seating available as well. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is expensive!  Now that I got that outta the way, here is what I thought of Guu.  I like the renovation and the layout; patio looks chilling too.  Service was exceptional.  A lot of yelling, but exceptional.  Our food came out fresh and promptly.  I had been to Guu downtown and the tapas were delicious from my memory.  Couldn't say the same this time though.  Surprisingly, their sashimi was friggin' amazing.  Probably the best I have had in Toronto.  The dessert platter was a great way to end the meal.  Highly recommend it if you have someone to share the platter with.  Parking is limited and you'll have to walk a little.  Hot food was mediocre and holy crap expensive.  I probably would not come back to be honest but I would invite ppl to go try it out.    BTW... Bad place to go on a date, loud and not much privacy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but I didn't  love the food. We ordered the preset course which came with fried chicken, rapini, seared salmon, seaweed salad, biminbop, an oyster dish and ice cream. I didn't think these items were that great. The rapini was way way way oversauced and overwhelming. The fried chicken was basic, and the bimimbop tasted sweet for some reason? It's super close to home so we'd go back and just order a la carte as we noticed better looking dished at the tables around us."}
{"text":"It is a loud place so do not expect to go there for a quiet evening. The food is actually amazing, I was floored.  The only thing I didn't like was how crowded this place is ALL the time. They need to expand their seating so you are not squished between people at the bar or on the tables.   Overall it was a wonderful experience and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Been to their 2 downtown and this location many times , always a great experience. Staff is really efficient and attentive- great service. Food is always consistent and good. What is there not to like ? Love their sake + cocktail selections as well"}
{"text":"Very good and traditional Japanese restaurants. I absolutely love all the food there?The baked oysters and the Japanese pancake are my favorites."}
{"text":"The food is not too shabby. I would pass on the fried Brie cheese the next time though, that feels/taste more like drunk food. The other dishes like the fried chicken and sushi are ok.  My main gripe is I wish the waiting/cooking team would just shut-the-f-up... seriously they're yelling all the time! I honestly thought I was going deaf. Totally destroyed the dining experience. I get that they are trying to keep up the team spirit and remind each other of the orders but it's too much!!  Pro-tip: if you have to go to this place, sit outside if the weather permits. Your ears will thank you."}
{"text":"I have to be very honest this place was disappointing.   I've been to both the other two locations plenty of times and this one is just not up to standard.   Food wise, the sushi and the deep fried brie cheese was good. However, everything else was not good. The worst was the raw shrimp because it wasn't fresh. It looked fresh but it wasn't. It was mushy! We ordered the calamari? It was also not good. It's suppose to be deep fried but it was soggy. We asked for them to take it back and they said they can only make a new one because they can't take it off the bill.   The service also wasn't as great either.  Just go to the other two locations!"}
{"text":"Came here last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Service was great as always and all the staff looked quite happy to be there. We ordered basically everything off the menu, however this location is not as good as the first location (Church St), the menu at Church & Bloor have more items and the food in the stone pots come out hotter and better at those locations. I am definitely a fan of Kinka, however won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"When comparing this Guu to the other locations, this was our most relaxed experience so far. We went on a Saturday at 5:00, with no reservations, and were seated right away.   And for those who are concerned about Guu's traditionally raucous volume level, here's a tip: on the patio, it's quiet enough for a conversation!   The food is always consistent at Guu, and I love their okonomiyaki and takoyaki the most. (Even more than the ones we ate in Osaka and Tokyo, to be honest.)  The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars? The panko-encrusted brie cheese needs more sauce! If the Guu chefs could start putting their delicious mango-berry sauce in a side dish, that would be perfect."}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars if I did this review after my first visit. I have visited all three Kinka/Guu locations but I go to the Yonge/Sheppard one most often since I live really close by. I have been here probably more than 20 times now and have tried almost everything on their menu. One thing I noticed is that their food quality is declining, not sure if it's because the increased popularity making them too busy to prepare the food properly. I went again with friends yesterday and we ordered our favourite items on the menu - the salmon oshizushi, the yaki udon, the chicken karage, and the kakimayo, etc. I was totally disappointed. Only the yaki udon was good. The rice in the oshizushi tasted awful...maybe it's time for me to find new places..."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the kinkalicious tasting menu which I thought was a \"winterlicious\" special for $29/person but it seemed like this course is offered all the time since I found it while looking at the regular menu.   It came with 8 courses, and definitely filling. The gomaee (blanched rapini and sesame sauce) and salmon tataki came out first - which both were my fav menu items of the night. The salmon was seared to perfection and the sesame sauce complimented well with the rapini. Next came the karaage and the short ribs. The pieces or karaage were massive and probably the best I've tried from all izakaya places. The short ribs were meh. The seaweed salad came next, which I wish it actually came at the beginning. The kakimayo and bibimbap tasted very similar, but was too cheesy and heavy for my liking. I barely ate any of the bibimbap because I was already so full. I also kind of wish the rice came a little earlier instead of the end.   They offered 2 choices for ice cream - matcha and black sesame. Prescooped.   Make sure you make reservations - you can do this via yelp! The service was pretty good considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya serves Japanese Tapas and has a great atmosphere for get togethers (though I would choose a quieter place for dates). Just don't be surprised if you leave with a sore throat from trying to talk to each other over the hubub. Try the patio in the summer for a quieter experience and to enjoy the weather. Although they have an excellent selection, they do have a few hits and misses.   Recommendations.  1) Pork Cheek - tender, juicy and has the most amazing flavour. Served as pieces on a skewer and easily shareable. Definitely a must try.  2) Brie Cheese - melt in your mouth goodness with a golden crust. The mango sauce helps cut the fattiness of the cheese. Great for any cheese lover 3) Miso Sea Bass - Delicate but intense flavors on a buttery tender sea bass. This is my go to every time. Comes as one slice of fish to share.  4) Blowtorch salmon sushi - perfect amount of torching for great texture and flavour. One of the best salmon sushi I've had.  5) Gomaee (blanched rapini and sesame sauce) - Reminds me of the sesame candy I used to eat growing up but in a savory format. Great balance and delicious veg dish 6) Karaage (fried chicken) - tender and crispy perfection with a buttermilk sauce. Must try here.  Avoid 1) Set menus unless you it has everything you want - tried the Valentines day set menu and it was not a success considering how good some of the other dishes are. 2) Takowasabi - As I'm not a fan of wasabi to begin with I found this overwhelmingly spicy 3) Seaweed and Tofu Salad - nothing special and not a particularily great flavour combination. I wouldn't recommend this one at all."}
{"text":"The manager said F*CK at our table. I signed up  to write this review.  I've never had such a TERRIBLE  experience at a restaurant.  The manager was clearly saying F*CK, something F**KING something FU*K about our table (i will describe in more detail).  Few hours ago we went there as a family night out. It was our first time going there. For starters, we (5 people) were shown to a table which was clearly a table for 4, to add to that it was crowded with the table right beside us. We couldn't possibly fit, so we asked to sit at another table but they told us other tables were all reserved. However we were able to sit at another table that was  across from it.      The servers didn't come at all, so we had to wave our hand for five minutes. The server didnt tell us about any specials or anything, he just came up.  We ordered about six dishes and a pitcher.  I went to a lot of izakaya and I had really nice experiences at most of them and the servers at other izakaya were all nice, informative and professional. However, all the servers in kinka did not smile at all. They all looked rushed and didnt describe the dishes when serving.     Anyway, as I was eating I saw a poster placed low on the wall, it was a promo for social hour from 5pm to 7 promo for pitcher and a dish for $15.  The server never mentioned it when we were ordering. We ordered the pitcher costing $17 at 6:30, so I asked the server to apply the promo to the current pitcher we ordered. At first he said he said he only can do that for the next new pitcher. But it wasn't fair since we were paying more for it and can't even get the  promo that we could have gotten. Later the server said he'll ask. After a few minutes I saw him going to the guy who seemed to be the manager. The server's back was facing me and the manager was facing our table. I saw the server pointing towards our table, seemed to be explaining the situation and all of sudden, the manager looks at our table, made a short eye contact with me. He made this scary face, I could see he's pissed. Then I  see him saying \"something something f*ck, something fu*king something f*ck, f*cking something\" What?? I was so shocked, all I said was I ordered the pitcher but I didn't know there was the promo, can you  apply it to the current one. After seeing that unbelievable scene, I said to the server that I saw him swearing at our table and then the server said that the manager was just angry at himself.  So as you can see, by this what I saw was all true. By that reply, he was admitting that the manager actually swore where the customers can see. Also the manager was definitely saying the F word at our table. After paying for our bill we stood up to leave and the manager was standing in the middle of the path between the tables. As i passed by he didnt move or said anything, he just stood there.  I was excited to go here at first but after tonight, this was the most horrible experience I ever had. In addition, I am scared to go there again because of the 'manager' guy might drop the f-bomb towards the customers. Also the servers never came to check on us , they were shouting all the time, it was too loud, overall terrible.  Oh and for the food, one of the dish, the prawn sashimi was good and the virgin mojito was cool. The tuna tataki (the name on the menu is different) was fishy."}
{"text":"What a great experience it was! Took the best friend here for dinner on a Monday. We ordered the jellyfish, pork belly, baked oyster and some chopped salmon sashimi with 7 friends. Everything was amazing! Well, the chopped sashimi was meh. Maybe because we both weren't big fans of the sticky bean. We also ordered drinks. She got her favourite drink, passion. I tried the February special drink, Green Island. They both were very tasty! The atmosphere is fun and refreshing. Always a nice place to stop by for some yummy food! The servers were helpful and so friendly. Will be back for dad's birthday!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the way the staff greet you when you walk in the door the Japanese way. The food is delicious however slightly overpriced and definitely not filling dinner material. It is mostly snacks and alcoholic drinks on the menu. It's a very cute place for date night (not baby friendly - no high chairs) and they have a nice patio as well. I love Black Asahi beer which they have, highly recommend trying it (cannot get it at LCBO or the Beer Store). The service was great, overall a great experience even though it was quite expensive. We had to order over $70 to be kind of full."}
{"text":"I reserved the table for lunch on Tuesday at 1:15. By the time I arrived the restaurant, there were very few people. So, I guess lunch time is not that crowded at all and no need to make reservation.   My friend and I ordered the following : 1 ) Sashimi Platter 2) Gyu Shabu Salad 3) Okra Tempura 4) Kakimayo 5) Agedashi Tofu  1) The sashimi was very fresh, however , there were only total 6 pieces of sashimi. This was definitely not enough for Sashimi lovers!   2) The Shabu Salad was excellent, the beef was freshly pan fried. IT went so well with the Black sesame dressing and veggies!  I love this salad a lot!   3) Okra was very healthy and tasty, it's even tastier when deep fried!!  Must try it!  4) Kakimayo, there were two oysters and truly mouth watering when it arrived on my table! It served really hot with the grilled cheese on top!! It's very juicy although the oyster was kind of small in the size. But it was a great match with mushrooms!!   5) Agedashi Tofu, my friend and I love this bowl of Tofu a lot, there were four big cubes of tofu and inside were not dry at all!   We didn't try any dessert today because we ordered too much food already!  Next time, I will definitely go again and try other dishes!   Parking is an issue : It's quite expensive to park in the Hallmark Centre ($5 for half an hour!! ) in weekdays. If we go there on weekends, it will be better as it's flat rate $6!!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices. Presentations are nice. Food were impressive. Baked oyster would surprise you"}
{"text":"The typical Izakaya items like karaage, take wasabi, kurage are all decent but there are many other izakaya places that make better ones for less price.   That's why when I see innovative and interesting items, I try them so I don't always have to get the same items.   Bad choice. The deep fried pumpkin with eggs and spicy mayo sauce was just horrendous. The presentation was great but the taste was beyond disgusting. I truly wanted to ask if any of the staff or the manager tried this item before putting it on the menu. The mix of pumpkin and spicy mayo... I can't. Also tried the deep fried Brie cheese. I love baked Brie and I even make it at home so I thought I'd enjoy this. It was what I expected but the mango sauce just didn't mix well with the cheese...  I'll just stick with the usual orders whenever I'm at kinka... probably not for a long time."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER food from this restaurant!!! We ordered tuna tartare, beef ribs and a number of other items. The tuna tartare appeared to be salmon and had a slimy consistency. The beef ribs tasted very off - both dishes were inedible. We ordered $67 worth of food and most of it had to be thrown out. A terrible waste of money. We're surprised (but grateful) that we didn't get food poisoning. I have never reviewed a restaurant online before, but felt compelled to warn others."}
{"text":"Something feels different about this place.  It has all those Kinka Izakaya (née Guu): the raucous greeting, the loud shout-outs of ordered items, the wooden and stone furnishings, the menu remains...but somehow, it feels changed.  Ordered the lobster sashimi ($16) off the daily menu, which wasn't quite live & kicking, but was a decent portion for the pricing.  My favourite salmon natto yukke seemed to be more largely cubed than it used to be with less consistency in size/cut, and less natto than the original - which could be a plus for anybody that's not a fan of the smelly beans.  The seared salmon sushi was OK, but could've used a lot more sear and maybe a gentler brush of soy sauce.  Am I being picky?  Maybe. With the heavy-handed soy sauce, more heavily salted salmon natto yukke, and only freshISH lobster sashimi, it feels like the care that used to be put into the dishes is not quite as it used to be - which makes it a little less fun and enjoyable.  Isn't that the heart of Guu? Come back, Guu - go back to your motto: Guu is Guu'd!"}
{"text":"After having gone to Kinka on Church on several occasions and loving all eating occasions (only complaint was the line ups), I was ecstatic when they opened a location in North York.    This location has a more upscale decor.  The food and service is comparable to the original.  Almost all of the dishes were throughly enjoyed by everyone at my table.  Stand outs were the kakimayo (oyster with mushrooms, mayo and cheese), salmon oshisushi and unagi bibimbap.   The only dish that we did not like was the salmon natto yukke (lacked texture and the raw egg made dish slimy).  Will be back for more great comfort food!"}
{"text":"I thought would be better and more special and more varieties but no, kinda disappointed , do t think I will go back"}
{"text":"Glad they opened a location near Sheppard and Yonge. Also convenient that you can make reservations online. Nice variety of food. Nice alcohol beverages."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends for a fancy Japanese food. The food was great and the restaurant had a great atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the pressed sushi and the cocktail that mixes beer with sake. I would love to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is unique compared to other Japanese restaurants. It gives me a really welcoming and excited vibe. The food was delicious and there were many different choices of alcoholic beverages. Some of the drinks look absolutely gorgeous.  If you're not into such a loud lively environment you might not enjoy your time at Kinka Izakaya as much. I however, loved it! O yea, I love love love baked oysters."}
{"text":"Thank you Stella and the Kinka team for making our evening special. The hostess was friendly,  helpful and accommodating to a last-minute change to our reservation from 2 to 4 ppl.  Great food, nice staff.  Thank you, we will be back."}
{"text":"Very clean and modern. Great decor!   All the food was good and came out piping hot. Scallop sashimi very fresh. Beef carpaccio recommended. Pressed salmon sushi surprisingly good!   We also found the service was very friendly and efficient. Everyone was so cheery and genuinely helpful!"}
{"text":"Food, service, ambiyance, value: 3.5/5  Repeat: Likely if I'm in the neighbourhood.  Guu at Church & Jarvis is still my favourite."}
{"text":"Oh my, I don't even know where to begin. Buckle up and settle in. This will be a long one.   Kinka Izakaya had the honour (I'm so full of myself) of being last year's chosen place for my friend's annual Christmas get-together.   I've been to a handful of izakaya places before (Nome, and even Kinka Izakaya located on Church St) and I've always had such a great time. The atmosphere, the people and the food are really top notch. Their enthusiasm is really what puts a smile on my face though, whether it be greeting the customers or celebrating their birthdays (their energy is limitless, honestly). The special on Thursday is the sake bomb (a shot of sake balanced on chopsticks resting on a glass of beer. I'm not sure if it was the drink I enjoyed or the whole experience accompanying the drink, but it's an absolute must if you visit on that day. There's a chant that goes along with the whole experience, but I won't delve into the details.. you just have to do it, trust.   We ordered the set menu ($40/person and it had to be a unanimous decision) along with a few other dishes and holy cow (!!) was there a lot of food. Beyond what we could handle, but for the most part it was scrumptious. The standouts were the torched sushi (salmon and saba), salmon tataki and the karubi (beef short ribs). I had the almond tofu for dessert and it was absolutely divine. The perfect way to end my meal.   Anyways, so my review wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be (whew), but I'm sure I'll find new things to love every time I come back.. which will be plenty."}
{"text":"I do not usually give two star reviews, but Kinka Izakaya North York earned it.  I waited 30 minutes to order. Then had to wait another 40+ minutes for the food to come. The prices are quite high for the quality and the amount of food you get. The waiters are too focused on screaming when people walk in that they completely ignore you when you try to grab their attention for napkins or extra utensils. Also, WHY SO LOUD? I understand that it is all about \"the energy\" and making the dining experience \"fun\" and \"different\", but oh my goodness, I could not even hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me! We stopped trying to converse with each other after a while. There was no point in screaming at each other over the noise when we can go somewhere else and talk. I feel bad for the waiters working there. How do you not get a headache after being there for over an hour?  We got out of there as soon as we could. Will not be back. The two stars I am giving is for their washrooms. I have to admit, they were pretty amazing, and very clean."}
{"text":"To be continue with further detail review for North York location after the previous upsetting incident. Decided to return for another try since kinka bloor was in great success with their recent summer festival ?? event!"}
{"text":"My favorite izakaya restaurant! I can close my eyes and order from their menu and still enjoy the food. Service is always great. Higher price point but quality food; not to mention their hojicha creme brulee is bomb. This location is roomier and has more parking, though Yonge St can get busy especially weekend nights. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is good here but the staff and policies are out of control.  We sat down for 65 mins and were told it was last call for alcohol. Reason being, 1 member of out party showed up 15 mins early and they changed out reservation to 6:45 instead of 7 and have a strict 2 hour policy.   Anyways, if you want to go to a bar, don't go here cus you get 1 hour to order and eat.   Lame"}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say I love eating at Guu Izakaya on Church and Guu Sakabar on Bloor. When I heard that Guu was opening in North York, I was ecstatic and I wanted to visit this location when they opened. After visiting this location for the first time, I was quite disappointed.  This Guu has that modern look to it from the outside and it is quite spacious on the inside. I was quite happy that this guu is very well lit from the inside and great natural lighting from the windows.   I was disappointed by the food and service. The kitchen messed up my party's orders somehow and it took more then an hour for four dishes to come. The server did not really do anything but insured my party that the food is on its way four times before taking action. Other tables that ordered the kinoko bibimbap later than my party got theirs first as we continued to wait for the bibimbap my party ordered.  The back area where you can take off your shoes and sit on a wooden area is an interesting experience. Just getting into that area is a hassle since you have to step over a big wooden plank. Also, you might disturb another table when you walk into the inner seating area and there isn't that much space to move. I just see people move their table to make more space to enter and exit.  Overall, I was quite disappointed at the food and quality of service. I know they just opened so I would give them some time to adjust. I'll avoid this location of Guu for a couple of months before I would try them out again.  UPDATE: After visiting this location a second time recently, the service and food was much better. I was surprised that it was not as busy as I thought it would be since it's the first Guu to open uptown. The presentation and food met my expectations of the original Guu downtown. I shall be definitely coming here again soon!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming to store & nice music & energy.. Food portion is small because it's Izakaya."}
{"text":"Excellent Yonge Sheppard interpretation of the church location. Same great food and experience !  it is a little more modern and brighter than its cousin on church street, but I really like these modern touches. as you can see in the pictures, it is brand spanking new (may/2015).The servers are quite delighted to see the guests who are arriving or leaving, and proceed to perform the usual yelling rituals as they do at the church st location. The location is very convenient for those who come from nearby condos, those who travel on TTC (since it is right next to the sheppard line) and even for those with cars, since there is FREE parking down the street (although I bet this will disappear soon) 5/5 place/ ambiance  food. the food is basically very much the same as the other location, which means that it is excellent. the beer is cold and refreshing. seems like the portions sizes are consistent, so none of this \"portion control\" that you sometimes see the restaurant implementing at their newer locations (yes suko thai, that's you) 5/5  The service is ok but can be slow 3/5  prices are on par with the other location so seemingly once again there is no upward drift that you see at other newer locations of restaurants (once again, suko thai you are guilty). 4/5 good value overall  Besides service, another reason I have not awarded 5 stars is because I need to verify the consistency of this restaurant, as I know that some other restaurants go downhill very quickly a few months after opening after the honeymoon is over"}
{"text":"What a nice & fun restaurant, I had fun. The food is yummy, the drinks are yummy and the service is really good, I would go back :)"}
{"text":"Good place to spend any weekend night with close friends. The atmospheres is really energetic. Food are good. Personally like taking wasabi a lot lol!! Usually I will order two of them."}
{"text":"Food 5 Service 4.5  The food was amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious! The only items we didn't like we're the sashimi salad and the Japanese hot pot, we thought they were meh. The soup didn't stand out but it was nice to have something that wasn't so rich in flavor but I wouldn't order it again. The sashimi salad didn't have much sashimi in it so that's why we didn't like it much. Everything else was to die for!   The service was good. They explained the menu quite well which helps if you've never been. We were seated at the back which we requested because we wanted a bit more privacy and something a little but more quiet as we were celebrating our anniversary, the only downside to sitting in the back was sometimes it was hard to get a servers attention.   But all in all the experience was amazing and worth the $$"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best Japanese restaurants that I've been to and I didn't even order ramen lol. Immediately when you set foot, you are greeted by the whole staff. The atmosphere is so fun and lively. I fell in love with the simple decor and their seating. I'm not going to lie there is a lot of yelling at this place but that's what makes this place so special.   I ordered the Kakimayo (Baked oysters),Gomaae (Blanched spinach w/ black sesame sauce),  lychee mojito, and Kinoko bimbinbap and several sake bombs. Let me just say that their drinks are amazing. I could have honestly had like five of those lychee mojitos. It was strong but the lychee paired so well with the minty taste, making it so easy to drink. On the other hand, the sake bomb was a drink and an experience on its own. Once you order one, a large portion of their staff rushes over and starts yelling this little chant (literally a guy ran over with a horn lol). It was so fun and made taking a sake bomb that much more fun. The food was just as good as the drinks if not better. The baked oysters were delicious and just the right amount of richness and a great alternative for those that do not like to eat raw oysters. The gomaae honestly left me speechless. For something so simple, it tasted amazing. I could have had like a whole bowl of it for myself. It was lightly seasoned, cool, and refreshing. Last but not least, was the kinoko bimbinbap. It was a really interesting take on a bimbinbap. It was creamy and reminded me of a risotto almost and once you hit the bottom, the stone bowl gave the rice an extra crunch that reminded me of the Chinese style clay pot rice.   I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is adventurous and loves seafood and/or drinking! The food is a little pricey but definitely worth it given the quality and service that they offer."}
{"text":"Great food, it is really authentic (not your typical sushi and rolls), the quality and variety are just amazing. The bad part is noise, it is absolutely crazy - there is a lot of shouting going on between the servers and the chefs, it is very loud and just goes on non-stop. I don't know whether the management invented this to add \"authenticity\" but it is clearly a bother for everyone. It is impossible to relax or to maintain a conversation. We had an older couple sitting next to us, they were so bothered by this constant shouting that they left in the middle of the meal without finishing their food. Next time we come there (and we will), we'll bring ear plugs..."}
{"text":"Had it not been for the noise (plus loud music), I'd give it a 5 - only bc my entire conversation with my guest was yelled, and my throat started to hurt mid-sit down, as we ended up talking MORE when we left since we could hear better lol (old person status, jk). I should also start off by saying that once you've experienced Japanese tapas, you will crave it the next day, I guarantee it. Everything on the menu is colour-coded so you need not get overwhelmed upon coming here if it's your first time.   At one point I felt I had more than one server as multiple employees were helping to clear our tables, replenish our plates and bring us drinks - not that there's anything wrong with that but I got confused as to who I was really tipping towards the end of the night.  The food was amazing! I ended up ordering, and recommend: the ebimayo-deep fried prawn w/ spicy mayo (6 pcs), takoyaki-how can you not know lol jk it's deep fried octopus balls w/ tomkatsu sauce & karashi mayo (6 pcs), the yaki udon-pan fried udon noodles w/ beef, mushrooms & scallion, karubi-grilled salt & pepper beef short ribs w/ scallion sauce (6 pcs), the salmon oshizushi-blowtorched atlantic salmon pressed sushi (6 pcs), hojicha brûlée-roasted green tea crème brûlée (soooo effing YUM) and a non-alcoholic carbonated pink lemonade drink - didn't like the drink so much, therefore I'd recommend you try something else, maybe water or sake.   What I also like about this place is that once you place a reservation, they send you a text an hour ahead to remind you of it and you must reply with instructions to confirm your seating. If you don't show up after 15 mins, the table is no longer held so it's always best to confirm.   I will also add that after some time of sitting in the middle near the bar that there was quite the draft. I was wearing a turtleneck and my guest, a sweater, so not too sure where it was coming from but hopefully management fixes this if it persists.   Another amazing thing is that the women's bathroom contains women's sanitary napkins for emergency purposes, as well as mouthwash + plastic shot glass cups which is soo refreshing and appreciative to see =D  Anyway, I would recommend this place again as I regret not drinking alcohol or ordering the unagi bibimbap (miso disappoint!) the location is also convenient for me so I'll take it!"}
{"text":"Definitely try this place out if you are looking for snacks and drinks.  So much energy in this place. Great cheap Sapporo draft beers. Kinka has been my go to place for late night snack and few pints. I love their $9.95 for 1L mug of draft beer (big pint). Tapas are also reasonably priced but I usually only order a few tapas. Great place to unwind after a busy day."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Delicious food. Advice for the manager: make sure noodles with beef are cooked in less than 15 minutes of waiting and that chicken is properly cooked through."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Party of 8, able to reserve on and alter reservation easily on yelp. I reserved for a Friday 2 days before and altered amount of ppl and time of arrival the night before. Glad I made a reservation as there was a constant crowd of ppl waiting for tables.   Food:  3 x kurage (marinated jellyfish) - Good, not the best, not the worst I've had. I wish it had a better bite.   2 x sashimi salad  - I wish it came with more sashimi, but everything about it was good.   2 x gyu carpaccio (beef tataki) - I did not care for the wasabi mayo on top of each piece. The tataki itself was nice.   2 x salmon tataki - Better than the gyu carpaccio. Would order this again over the beef tataki.   1 x agedashi tofu - Did not get to try this personally, but other ppl at the table enjoyed this. It came with five big pieces.   2 x kabocha korokke  (deep fried pumpkin w boiled egg) - Mmmmmm. I don't know why I really enjoy this. Maybe it's because this kind of flavour profile is not really available at other restaurants I frequent. The pumpkin is always good and the sauce complements the rest of the dish well.  1 x ikapiri  (deep fried calamari) - I will not order this again. It was not crispy and it seemed drenched in a red, sweet and sour type sauce. Passssss on this guys.  2 x chicken karaage  - Nice sized juicy chicken pieces. Chicken was a good colour (not like nomé).   2 x ebi mayo - Fried shrimp drenched in mayo. I've developed an adult shrimp allergy so could not try this T_T. Other ppl at the table really enjoyed this. They enjoyed the amount of mayo and felt they could even drink it. To each their own.  6 x tontoro  (grilled pork cheek skewer) - Nice and juicy. Seasoned well. Good quantity as well.   2 x karubi  (grilled salt n pepper short ribs) - These were okay. I felt the quality of meat could have been better. I also felt it was a small quantity.   4 x kakimayo  (baked oyster) - I had double servings. Not the best baked oysters ever, but I love baked oysters. Had some potato, mushroom and cheese (in addition to the oyster). I will order this again.   2 x yaki udon - I've been to menami and really enjoy all their udon. This udon rivals some of theirs. Noodles were right. The dish did not feel cheap. Would order this again.   1 x kinoko bibimbap  - Soooo good. Each bite was perfect. I would order this again.   2 x salmon oshizushi  (press salmon sushi) - I have a love hate relationship with pressed sushi. First, I love when food is torched. The salmon on top was okay, fully cooked. The rice was flavored/seasoned right, but I am not sure how I feel about the portion. I know there has to be a certain amount of rice in pressed sushi, so maybe it's just me being a sashimi over sushi person. Maybe this would be better if there was a bigger piece of salmon on top of the rice or less rice. Again, this is preference.   2 x black sesame ice cream  - Da bomb. Nice texture, not too sweet.  1 x hojicha brulee  (green tea creme brulee) - Brûlée was really good. Had all the right textures; crunch and creaminess. Matcha ice cream on the side is like any other matcha ice cream.   1 x seven colourful samurai  - I enjoyed the shooter from this. 7 shooters in total with 1 candle in a lime slice. They came out with a bday sign, lit the candle on the shot & sang happy birthday. I blew the candle out too soon as it was not a traditional bday song #newb. It's nice that they take a photo to give you after bringing this out. I wish they didn't have to post it on IG. Especially since they only do one take. Maybe give ppl the option..  1 x samurai bomb  - 3 tier bomb. I believe the top tier has the sake, the middle tier had a blue concoction, and the bottom tier had (a lot of) beer. It was good for chugging even though the bowl was awkwardly large.  1 x nana lemon - My friend didn't like that he had to squeeze his own lemons for his drink. He also put too much of it in which ruined it.  1 x asahi  (630ml) - Yum.  1 x ramune mojito  - Yum.  1 x cherry blossom - Syrup-y, but yum.  3 x lychee high - You could barely taste the alcohol in this drink, but the flavour was just right.  3 x black (Japanese dark beer) - My friend loved this. Esp. Since we don't get asahi black in Ontario anymore.  Service: Efficient, friendly staff. They all made sure we were taken care of and made us feel welcome. I read that they had a 2 hour seating limit on busy nights, but we were there for over 3 hours. I did not feel pressured to leave or eat my food quickly. Absolutely no complaints about the staff.   Final thoughts: I will be back for sure. I enjoyed almost all my food. The drinks I had were all great. Loved how spaced out the tables are from each other and I appreciate the really high ceilings. This space is a huge plus especially compared to the other cramped izakayas in the area. The music was bumpinnn' and set the vibe throughout dinner.  I would recommend this izakaya to others, just make sure to order the right food!"}
{"text":"Yet another fantastic visit! I'd never been to this location and it might be my favourite. The indoor and outdoor seating is awesome. There are large tables, like the other locations as well as a more private area at the back. This location is the least loud out of the 3.  We went with the tasting menu, $33/per person, and a pitcher of Sapporo, $17. It's a big tasting menu and you are absolutely stuffed by the end. Service was good, but if you're at a small table, you may have to eat a little quick to start; when the plates come out the table fills fast!  Reservations are not required, but definitely recommended!  Love this place! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This Izakaya restaurant was not only a place to get delicious food, but it was a completely immersive Japanese bar experience! This was my first time at a restaurant/bar like this and it completely blew me away.   The menu had a lot of variety with an extensive list of drinks (non-alcoholic, beers, wines, soju) and dishes. Dishes here are typically small plates meant for sharing. There are also set course menus offered where a 10/15 course meal is presented for a set price. This ends up being cheaper than ordering each dish individually, especially when dining with a large crowd. There is a minimum order required on the set course menus of 2 orders. The dishes seem to be priced decently but when they arrived, they were smaller than expected. In the end, because of the small size of dishes, the bills ended up being quite high. I still think it was worth it because of how much fun the ambience of the restaurant is.   There's yelling, there's sake bombs, there's clapping, there's table pounding, it's all present at this Izakaya. Every time someone orders a Sake Bomb, the whole restaurant knows about it and cheers for them as they chug. The layout is what is typical of a Japanese Izakaya i've heard, with low wooden tables and cushions to sit on. This one in particular had a long line of smaller tables by the windows, a long bar and then bigger booths at the back. Quite a small restaurant, but the space was used well. The booths are unique where you have to take your shoes off when you're seated :)  I would definitely return to this location! The staff were very welcoming and treated us well throughout!  Note: There's a 2 hour seating limit once you place your first order."}
{"text":"We came there for their summerlicious . Set menu for a set price! Just found that they were kind of rush to have all plates came out almost the same time.  We sat outside with nice breeze and much quiet than inside with their signature yelling."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 dishes here. Flamed salmon sushi, kakimayo, and tempura. It took 10 mins for the first dish to be out from the moment I ordered, and I could say it was relatively fast because there were so many people. Flamed salmon sushi was cold, and I had to check it was really flamed. Kakimayo (oysters with mayo+cheese) had too much mayo and cheese in it. I barely tasted oyster. Tempura was alright, but it was average. I believe people go to this place because of the atmosphere, which was indeed amazing. However, I have tasted better Japanese food. I really did not see anything special about this place."}
{"text":"[Service] - fast and consistent service - amazing energy in the restaurant  - loud and party - like atmosphere  - loud welcome from the employees (they yell uraishimasaen, which means welcome in japanese) - food comes out fast one by one  [Food] - a bit pricy but food is worth it - very delicious and fresh - personal favourites are the udon, takoyaki and sushi pieces - presentation is attracting  [Cleanliness] - very clean, especially in the special no-shoes seats and bathrooms - tables and tableware cleaned and dried  Overall, amazing restaurant to go to with a bunch of friends. You order a lot of dishes and share among others."}
{"text":"The food was good when they were still Guu, now everything tastes not as fresh and is really oily.  The service is really bad. The waiter and waitress were really rude the last two time I came here. They showed no concern for customer needs (perhaps they know they would get tips no matter what). My friend was still eating and the moment she had a last bite, the waitress took the plate away without asking if she could clean it up. Not to mention that she gave us the bill when we were still eating and when we paid, she kept staring at the machine (I felt a bit pressured and uncomfortable).  The chicken cartilage is good, I get it every time I come here."}
{"text":"Definitely reminds me of Vancouver and makes me a bit homesick. I know it's not longer owned by the Guu franchise, but it retains a lot of the menu items and names, and makes me feel like I'm back at Guu Garden (my favourite of the Guus).  The Kurage is a favourite of mine, though this one is certainly smaller than what I'm used to. Flavours are still good, but portions make me a bit sad panda. The Gindara is a classic and you can't really go wrong with it, though I recall it used to be served with a radish paste to cleanse the palate. We also got the ebimayo which came with some lettuce - and I secretly wish the lettuce had some of the delicious spicy sauce so I could continue devouring it. I also ordered the kimchi udon - another classic but this one seemed to lack in cod roe. The textures didn't stand out as much. And lastly, the salmon oshizushi, because I had been craving some pressed sushi. This one was delicious, melt-in-your-mouth with smoky flavours that made me pat the belly in content. Oh, we also ordered the cold soba noodles from the summer menu, but I didn't feel like it was anything to write home about.  Overall, it is definitely on par with my memories of Guu. I hope it stays around for a while, the food is good and the service is as expected! Not sure about the kid-friendliness, as I was fortunate enough to go without the munchkin (SQUEE!). But I'd definitely come back for more food when my Vancouver cravings kick in."}
{"text":"This latest addition has relative poor service compared to the Church and Bathurst Location which have stellar service.   At the new Yonge and Sheppard Location, the service is not coordinated, and sloppy likely because the servers are not exclusively Working Holiday Visa staff from Japan, but instead a mix of indifferent"}
{"text":"The other night my friends and I came here for dinner and it was an interesting experience. Every time people walked into the bar the staff began chanting greetings in Japanese. The food was really good but I found the restaurant to be stingy. The only things I could eat on the menu, since I'm both lactose and gluten intolerant were a sashimi salad, rice and edamame. What I didn't love about this restaurant was the fact that I couldn't use the dressing the salad came with so I asked for picked ginger instead. The waiter then told me I had to pay extra for the ginger root. I found that to be quite cheap. Aside from that, the the experience was really good!  Would I go back? I probably will not go back as there are many other restaurants I can check out instead but I do think it's a good choice if you have no dietary restrictions and if you want to share tappas with everyone at the table."}
{"text":"I don't normally give five stars unless it exceeded my expectation and this sure did! Service was great where servers were polite, friendly and regularly checked up on us. The atmosphere is loud and packed with people and you must make a reservation. I found it interesting how the chefs and servers all yell in unison to welcome people entering and thanking customers together when leaving. With that being said, the environment was clean. The only downfall would be the table size. We kind of wanted to try a whole bunch of things and were seated near the window for two people. The table was small and very crowded once the food came out. Other than that, the food exploded with flavour! Portions are perfect with lots of flavour. I highly recommend the oysters and the Atlantic salmon sushi (i think its a sushi)! I will most definitely come back for more and my goal is to try everything on the menu eventually. Little steps at a time :)"}
{"text":"Their servers are very passionate and enthusiastic  I would recommend the drink called \" sake boom\" there, you would definitely get a awesome experience if you are the first time. Their food are pretty good, too. Their set menu is worth to try if you are the first time there. Anyway, worth it to try out."}
{"text":"The food there was awesome. We ordered torched salmon sushi, takoyaki, cod, oyster and bibimbap and cheesecake.  Sushi and takoyaki were just yum. Their cod and oyster were amazing. Their cod got marinated and tasted a bit sweet, the skin was crispy and yet not greasy. The oysters were covered by cheese with mushrooms, oyster and scallop underneath.  I had matcha cheesecake for dessert. It's the first time I tried matcha flavour, it was combined with sourness (sour cream) and bitterness (green team power) - not really my type. But the texture was fine and smooth.  We also tried sake bomb (Thursday's special). Beer with sake turned out a good combine, tasted fresh and not bitter at all!  The ambience was noisy. The servers there have to yelling all the time because of the restaurant's culture, which made you have to yell to communicate too."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday around 9:45. Got 2 seats at the counter right away.  Great food, tho probably a bit pricey, but expected at an Izakaya place.  - Tako wasabi: diced octopus in wasabi sauce with dries seaweed as a wrap. Tasted great. Nice, strong wasabi taste. - Decent takoyaki - Saba oshizushi: mackerel pressed sushi. Nothing special. - Wagyu carpaccio: seared beef sashimi (on the specials menu). Decent, but kinda pricey. - Lobster and Scallop sashimi: really fresh. - Baked Oysters: Great size and great taste. - Salmon natto yukke with seaweed for wrapping: pretty good. - Green tea cheese cake and green tea creme brulee: Both pretty good.  In terms of atmosphere, even though I expected it to be so, it was way too loud for me. So much yelling made it hard to converse.  Service was quick and attentive.  8.5/10 for food quality, 7.5/10 for value, 8.5/10 for servixe. 8/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Decent izakaya in North York. Came with friends after they changed name on weekday night. Was very spacious and not packed like on the weekends. The food was pretty standard. I was not blown away.   Had my usual takoyaki, delicious. Some sort of salmon tataki, it was okay. Grilled pork belly was good and fatty. Chicken karage was still pretty good, love the mayo. Yaki udon, the usual.  Tried the baked oyster for the first time and it was pretty good! The sauce was creamy and there was lots of goodies in there, not just some random veggies. And I love the Kinoko bibimbap, there's just something about hot melted cheese!    In terms of desserts I think that almond tofu and sesame soy milk pudding was just not worth the price. For the same price elsewhere you can get a whole bucket full and it's really nothing special. But I did love the green tea cheesecake, the execution was great, it was creamy and well combined, not powdery, not too sweet, worth the money.   The service was okay, seats were hard. And as usual super loud, don't bring your kids."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad.  Some dishes are actually pretty good, others are just average or even mediocre.  The problem is the atrocious service.  They're so busy yelling when every little thing happens (someone walks in the door, someone orders a shot, someone's birthday) that they get distracted from what they're supposed to do like bring out the food, check on and order, or even (and I kid you not) bring you the soy sauce they forgot to bring.  Dishes took on average an hour to be served.  The hamachi sashimi (which the waitress said was flown in everyday from Japan BTW - it most certainly was not and was one of the worst hamachi sashimi I've ever had) was relatively quick at about 40 minutes.  Let's not even question why it takes 40 minutes to cut a few pieces of fish, but why would you only bring one soy sauce dish for 4 people?  So we asked for soy sauce dishes for everybody and nothing happens after 10 minutes.  We then ask a second time, and a waitress brings *one* soy sauce dish after another 10 minutes.  On and on this went throughout the whole meal.  2 hours and 45 minutes later, I have a migraine from all the incessant yelling (and yes, I have no issues going to other loud places like Kinton Ramen), and they still hadn't brought two dishes out.  Save your money for the real Guu Izakayas.  This former Guu is a disaster."}
{"text":"When boyfriend and I walked into this place, we were greeted right away by the staff. The atmosphere was loud and friendly which will make you feel happy. We ordered:  - Karaage: The chicken pieces were thick, tender, and so flavourful - Takoyaki: It actually has a lot of octopus in it, unlike the takoyaki that you order from most ayce sushi places! - Saba oshizushi and salmon oshizushi: I highly recommend these two dishes.  - Yaki udon: Really delicious  We definitely will be coming back and everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great. 10/10"}
{"text":"Basically it's Guu so I naturally LOVE this place.  I always get Gomaae (spinach with black sesame sauce). Who doesn't love black sesame?! The sauce was overly salty this time and I just wish that it came as the same time as my rice so I could mix all the leftover sauce in.  My other go to is the kinoko bibimbap (rice, mushrooms, cheese with seaweed sauce in a sizzling stone bowl).  Comes out piping HOT and then they mix everything together for you.  This combo I know sounds weird but honestly it's my fav dish here.  The best is when you leave the rice on the sides of the bowl untouched so at the end the rice becomes crispy :D   This time I tried the seared tuna sashimi for the first time and now I'm left wondering - why didn't I try it sooner!! The tuna was SO fresh, a definite new fav~"}
{"text":"I'm glad they decided to make a guu izakaya uptown because their food is amazing. Their sake mojito, ebimayo and kakimayo is really good, especially the kakimayo.   There is free parking near residential areas and the wait wasn't too bad on a weekday night."}
{"text":"Came here with the family on a Saturday night.  The place was LOUD, too loud.  It was constant yelling from all the staff.  I don't think they went 30 seconds without yelling.  They tell when people enter or leave.  they yell the food orders to the kitchen. They have this 3 level sake bomb and when someone orders it, they yell. When it's someone's birthday, they yell.  A bit too much.  Food was good.  We ordered some sashimi but mostly cooked foods.  They udon was awesome!  The grilled pork belly was a tad too salty.  All the portions were tiny.  Service was good.  The servers were all very attentive and brought over whatever we needed right away.  To end, good food, good service.  Just way too loud!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food I got here.  I got the kinoko bibimbap and am still craving more. My only wish is that  the serving portion would be larger. Love the way the servers greet customers by yelling in japanese ;, their enthusiasm is non- stop and contagious because I ended up yelling too somehow even though I don't know the language. I'll definitely be comimg back with more ppl"}
{"text":"Service is beyond superb. The whole team just gives off this amazing \"I love my job vibe\" and it makes us, the customer feel welcomed. I really like their welcome and goodbye shouts, god knows what they are screaming but heck it makes me happy.   Food can be pricey, but the black sesame ice cream is a must try!  We were seated at the back in the no shoe zone which I thought was pretty unique and entertaining."}
{"text":"Traditional Japanese restaurant, I had the tasting menu . 33 $/person, the bamboo suki was super!!! Everything that I've tried was fantastic!!!! Great place for birthdays"}
{"text":"This is was my first time not only here, but trying a Japanese restaurant in downtown Toronto (just moved to the city, hey!). We went for a friend's birthday and I can't stop thinking about what a good time we all had. The service was friendly, quick and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing. I see some people complaining about the yelling but I definitely enjoyed it when entering/leaving the restaurant.  The prices were a bit steep (there were only three of us and we had a $160 bill), but I definitely can't complain about the food either. I had the unagi bibimbap upon recommendation by our server and it was bomb. The scallop sashimi, fried chicken, and banana tempura were also bomb. Sake served in a bamboo chute is also a really nice touch.  I wish the portion sizes were a bit bigger, but I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Fun Place- and its all about the staff there. You will feel like you are walking into a different country as soon as you arrive. The seating and low tables.  The staff will scream and welcome you. if you never experienced a Guu Izakaya before- try not to get a heart attack or get over anxious or egotistic. They do that for everyone.   Tapas based- the larger the group - the better this place is. Their pitcher and Saki prices are very affordable- Almost to the point where you will get drunk!  Their menu is not the easiest to figure out- however the staff is knowledgeable and the amount of items constantly being run from the kitchen to customers - you will definitely find something that would connect your eyes. I ordered the Karaage and the Giant prawn and sashimi. Karrage is fried chicken strips almost. Was delicious. Crisp outside- nice and chewy inside. The giant prawn was cooked CRISP - and when I say crisp- i mean with the shell and tenticles all battered . Deep fried to the max. It changed the entire taste of the item. Almost turned the shrimp into like a roasty peanut taste. Interesting to say the most. I loved the sashimi shrimp. I was surprised how good it was. Arent all cold shrimp supposed to taste teh same?? I am curious to find out if there other sushi's are jsut as good.  I definately will be back here with a larger group."}
{"text":"I have been to different izakayas, and this is the worst. I know this is the \"old guu\" but thank god they changed their name otherwise they will ruin the name of GUu. The service was bad, yes bad enough. The host split the table into half WITHOUT ask for our permission. I know they want to fill more people but the seat was just enough space for 2 people. Second, they messed up our order, and guess what sashimi platter is the LAST dish I ate from yesterday's dinner. The smell after eating raw fish stayed in our mouth. I guess they don't care lost me as an individual or us one table of customer only.  Seriously, I will never go back to any kinka izakaya."}
{"text":"This was so disappointing! I normally go to the Guu on Church St. and have always had an incredible experience there, so I was so excited when this North York location opened. Unfortunately, the quality just isn't at par with their other locations.   I will say there is still a nice ambience and you do get the true Guu feel with the loud greetings. This location is also more spacious and there is garage parking available ($6 on the weekend). I'm also so glad that Guu now takes reservations.  Unfortunately, the food was not great. I had 2 items off the menu that I had tried at the Church St. location before (deep fried brie cheese and grilled Saba mackerel) and 4 items that I had not (Unagi bibimbap, sashimi salad, kakimayo, and hojicha brulee).  Deep fried brie cheese: Noooo! Love it everytime at the Church St. location, but this one seems like it was deep fried for too long. The outside was rock hard. Inside was still the oozy brie goodness though.   Grilled Saba mackerel: Normally one of my favourites, but here the fish was tough. I'm not entirely sure what was wrong - either the quality of the fish itself, or it was overcooked.   Unagi bibimbap: This is the first time I have ever received a watery bibimbap. Not just at Guu, but at any restaurant I've been to. It also wasn't sizzling when it got to the table which is also a first.   Sashimi salad: This salad was huge! Not what I was expecting at Guu, as the portions are normally small. It was mostly a big bowl of greens, topped with some sashimi. The sashimi was seared on the sides, which I'm ok with if the pieces are large enough so it's still mostly sashimi... but only a couple were big pieces, the rest were very thin slices.    Kakimayo: these are 2 baked oysters. It was interesting... Piping hot when it got to the table which was nice. Tasted a bit like fishy spinach dip.  Hojicha brulee: Roasted green tea creme brulee. It was more like an extremely soft and creamy green tea ice cream with torched sugar on top.   I'm really hoping that this was because they just opened and the chefs haven't gotten into their groove yet. I will probably try going to this location again next summer to see if they get better, but until then... it's the other locations for me."}
{"text":"SumimaSen!!! Jaaa ma ta!!! I think those are the Japanese sayings they yell when you leave and go home and my personal favorite \"when I say Sake u say.....\"  \"BOMB!\"  Hahaha!  You cannot come here without ordering the Sake Bomb and having the entire staff do their sake bomb song.  Trust me...its worth it! Haha!  The ritual was so awesome I ordered 3 more!    O yes...the food...I forgot about the food but from what I DO remember it was all so damn Delicious! I ordered their version of fried chicken, eel Bibimbop, Tuna tartar, and my friends pretty much ordered everything else on the menu. The food came quick and the portions were what you expect for an Izakaya place.    As the previous reviews stated DO NOT come here if you are looking for a quiet dinner.  Only come here if you want to have a great dinner with plenty of yelling and fun and smiles....so say it with me one more time...  \"When I say SAKE...you say....\"  \"BOMB!!\""}
{"text":"Always a good spot to eat yummy jap food! Consistent good quality and tasting food! Love the patio when its summer time! Almond tofu is a must get at the end of your meal !"}
{"text":"This place used to be called GUU, but it has changed since. I assume that the ownership is the same, but the name is different.   In terms of the decor, it look really nice. The atmosphere is a little bit loud, so it may be a little bit difficult to talk, but overall it was impressive.   The menu was on the empty side, We went on a Sunday night, and three things that we wanted to order was sold out. We started ordering from their regular menu, but as there wasn't a huge selection, The food became very repetitive. We had a large part, so we ordered a lot of food, but after a while, we just weren't sure what to order. Thus, we didn't leave super full as with other locations, we just left ok.   The one thing that wasn't pleasant was the Gindara. That dish took 1 hour to come out. After a while, we just didn't want the dish, but as it was being cooked already, we just patiently waited. We were done all the food and ready to go with that fish arrived.   Overall, not a bad experience, but not a good experience either. I don't know if I would go back.   FYI, the bill came out at $250 for 6 people. It was an expensive meal."}
{"text":"I wrote a terrible review for the former Guu location on church street. I am happy to report that the new name and perhaps management has really turned this place around.   I was shocked how good it is. All my concerns with it's Guu existence have been addressed.   There is now space between tables for a normal human to walk through!  The noise level is bearable! perhaps due to the fact that I go when it's not so busy.   Normal adult sized portions! Great value!   Everything I tried here has been awesome. Especially the mackerel sushi!  Guu has grown up, and it's wonderful."}
{"text":"I went there on Friday night with group of friends. I can honestly say the Downtown Guu is SO MUCH BETTER. The service(North York) was not as good as DT plus cocktails were really not good(we had most of the cocktails there, they were under average). The food was so so- one of my friends got an overcooked salmon( \"that's a shit\" exact words she said). Don't think I will go again."}
{"text":"The experience at GUU tonight was pretty much like eating in a sauna room. It has no ac at all which is unacceptable for the summer and it makes you lose all your appetite immediately. I asked the server at the end if their ac is broken or is this normal and she told me this normal... I was so surprised that this is okay for their standard.  The food was okay and nothing new compared to the downtown locations. Service was limited to 2 hours even though no one was waiting and it is as loud as always.... Not sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"It is the best izakaya restaurant in Toronto that I've been to so far. Ordered 4 dishes for 2 people, we were full and satisfied with the food, very delicious. It's loud inside, but that's just izakaya style and after a while you just get used to the loudness. Good service.  4 dishes + 2 alcoholic beverages= $54 with tax"}
{"text":"This place is my worst izakaya in toronto ever All of portions of their menues are tooooooo small and the taste of food we order is not that good..which the sever recommended to us as a \"today's special\". If u want to come to this place to have a meal, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I think this will be my first and last visit at this restaurant. I've been coming here since when this chain was called Guu. I came here for a birthday lunch, I've ordered the salmon pressed sushi, salmon sashimi, oysters, takowasabi, I've ordered sparkling sake. The ramen tasted awful, it was comparable to the instant noodles that I make at home. I wasn't expecting a typical ramen quality at an izakaya place, but the quality wasn't there. The service was awful, the two empty bowls sat there for the whole meal. I needed an extra chopstick and I can't wait any longer as my food was getting cold, so I ended up getting up to get a pair of chopsticks myself. Also, when I called to ask if there's anything for the birthday girl. According to the website there's a dessert celebration, and even when I called and asked they didn't say no. After I ate $120 worth of food, they said no special dessert for the birthday person. So I called back and inquired what was embedded in the birthday celebration. They said if you order a dessert off the menu, we will come out to sing. If I was given that information, I would have ordered the dessert anyways. I wasn't expecting a free dessert for my birthday, I just wanted a nice birthday lunch. It was a very disappointing experience and kind of ruined my birthday!"}
{"text":"We got the $29 tasting menu and it was pretty good! The food came fast at the beginning but towards the end when it got busier service became slower and slower...  Standouts were the pork belly skewer, salad and chicken karaage. I'm not a huge fan of cheese so the mushroom cheese bibimbap and oysters with cheese wasn't really appealing to me, by my bf loved it. We also ordered a torched salmon aburi and it was average (3/5) the salmon wasn't torched enough and it lacked mayo so no creamy flavour. The torched sushi from Jabistro is a lot better.   We sat next to the bar so it was really really loud and hard to talk so next time if we ever come again I'd rather sit outside."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The quality is always great and my favourites are definitely the baked oyster with cheese and the takoyaki. The service is quick and prompt but the one thing I don't like is how they pack in the tables so much during rush hour so that you're sitting next to strangers. The price is deserving of the quality and they welcome and say good bye to everyone that comes and leaves. It's a very loud place so this isn't a good place for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"its really good, its not expensive, nice environment hard to find lol"}
{"text":"Went in with my boyfriend for date night. Great service and no complaints! Awesome food too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are amazing, vibrant and friendly! The food is delectable, not too salty. Good portion sizes. The ambience is cheery. The theme is wood-inspired. Love the karaage, karubi, baked oysters, bibimbap, tontoro, butabara, ramen and brie cheese. Paid $250 for 8 people (minus the drinks). Sake bomb!"}
{"text":"Service and quality did not fall short of the other locations! This was my first time at the North York location and my boyfriend and I were pleased with everything. Service and quick and food was delicious as always. Our favourites are the baked oysters and gyu carpaccio.   It does get loud, but it's expected as it's an izakaya! We came here earlier in the evening, so I was able to enjoy the natural lighting that came in from the large windows; different from the other locations, which was a nice alternative from its usual dimmed setting."}
{"text":"I went on a week day during dinner time and was Seated promptly. I just have to say the service was garbage. They did not greet us for drinks first and took very long, probably 20min, to come back to let us order our food. Even paying the bill took 15min with two reminders! So the service was horrible!  But Im giving them two stars because their food is still pretty good regardless of their service. Maybe they had an off day but I was very disappointed with this location because I've been to their other downtown location a couple of times and the service was friendly and exceptional. I'd refer you to their downtown location."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time at Kinka and it will most definitely not be my last!!  The moment you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a warm and loud welcome by all staff. The environment is very modern with the sounds of the latest tracks. That is my favourite part!   As for getting seated, if you plan to have dinner between Friday - Sunday you must make reservations!! The place gets crowded and you may have to wait for an hr.   Now moving onto the actually food, I recommend you try several dishes and split it with your friends/date. Better buck for you money!"}
{"text":"We were lucky cuz we got a separate table for two next to the window on a Saturday night without an appointment! Most of the tables there are placed very close to each other, personally I'm not very comfortable with that setting.   The food are very tasty and fresh! I really like the oysters! It's incredibly delicious! The waiter was very nice, we told him it's our first time there so he explained the dishes to us and also recommended a warmed Japanese sake, tastes smooth and clean.  Yes this place it very loud just like most izakaya, but it creates a different atmosphere, we liked it."}
{"text":"A fan of the original Guu, I'm glad they now have pictures and a much more extensive menu!  I opted to sit on the patio, as it was much quieter, spacious and airy. However, it did get a bit chilly near the end of the night. I wished they had heat lamps.  The service was super and the food came out at a good pace. Highlight of the night was the super fresh sashimi, large juicy karaage and peach stuffed w/ cream cheese and topped w/ coconut ice cream (seasonal menu). Yum!  I'll defiantly come back for more visit, because of the food and service."}
{"text":"Best place to eat and have a good time in North York. The environment is so energetic. Everything on the menu is a hit and the sake bombs are fantastic. I'd move in if I could."}
{"text":"Overall great restaurant  The atmosphere and decor was good What I ordered was a little bit too salty for my tastes but still very delicious. the ramen and short ribs was way too salty otherwise it would be perfect  Ramen noodles where fresh and cooked just right - not overly soft.  Short ribs was also too salty and the sauce in a separate bowl was nice but also salty. Lol  salmon taki was perfect.  I'd def come here again and ask for less salt."}
{"text":"This place is legit, they have real Japanese people yelling at you. The food is super good, I got the bim bim bap, the blow torch sushi, regular sushi, the beef, and a few other things... This place is good. Don't go to whole foods go to this place"}
{"text":"As with any Kinka/Guu in Toronto, they pretty much have the same menu. Always a reliable izakaya.  This one tends to have almost no line ups, even on Fridays/Saturdays that I've come here. Their service is sort of slow even with empty tables.  Good choices are takoyaki, okonomoyaki, potato pancakes, the udon/fried rice, raw dishes are apparently good (I dont eat raw but friends told me), and end it off with double black sesame ice cream.  Also tried their bday dessert platter. You get four different desserts to try and each is mini sized. Loved the green tea cheesecake and creme brulee.  Prices here are high for small portions but you are paying for the crazy welcoming and loud atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Hubby and wifey are very familiar with the Guu location downtown and it has always been our favorite.  This location was equally as good and the seating was more spacious. Love the food as always. Was highly satisfied with: Kaarage, Salmon Ozisushi, Kakimayo, Kinoko Bibimbap, Yaki Udon."}
{"text":"This place is constantly packed in the evenings. Their food is very tasty but small portioned. It's a bit on the pricier side for what you get. It's a loud environment so it makes socializing a bit hard. You're constantly trying to yell to talk to your friends"}
{"text":"Everyone and their pets should already know by now...Kinka Izakaya used to be Guu. So what's different? For starters, this location looks more updated/modern and gives me a Cactus Club-y vibe instead of good ol' Guu.  Dropped by on a Friday night, no resos, and was seated outside (preference) within a matter of minutes. I think I've always had to wait at least 5-10 minutes without resos at Guu. The attentive and friendly staff also gave us recommendations--I don't need them but was interested to see what the server had to say!  Ordered some fail safes such as takoyaki, kinoko bibimbap, calamari salad (daily special), and the ever popular, salmon oshizushi. Overall, the food is just as I remember it. Now, I'm not sure if it's the vibe that has distracted me but let's cut them some slack.  Yes, I'm a fan of their loud shout-outs when you enter and exit the establishment, the vibe, and their delicious tapas. Long live izakayas!"}
{"text":"Been here twice this year with two different groups. I must say, I am a fan of their food and absolutely the vibe/energy I get from this restaurant.  Note: prepare your ears! Haha. As you soon as you get in, all of the staff will greet you with a very loud shout out! It is very exciting and lively. I quite enjoyed their welcoming presence.   My most favourite is the Salmon Oshizushi which is blowtorched Atlantic salmon pressed sushi. Their salmon is the only salmon I have had by far here in Toronto that melts in my mouth. Yes, melts in your mouth quality. And that is the best!  I also loved the Karaage which is the deep fried soy sauce marinated chicken. Its very addicting! So flavourful and crispy. A definite must when you go. And some other safes: Kaki Mayo Baked Oysters, Gomaae - blanched spinach with sesame sauce & any of the Bibimbaps.   This is a very fun place to go to with group of friends, family or even for a date night if you dont mind all the noise from the staff's shout outs. And what made the experience unique and interesting is that, we were asked to take off our shoes before sitting! Just like in Japan. Absolutely amazing!   The only hiccup I didnt like was that they dont split bills. So for a big group coming here, its a major hassle. Other than that, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, good food, nice atmosphere except needs lots of improvement in ventilation. You WILL smell like a dish when you finish your meal and need a thorough head to toe cleansing to get the food aroma off yourself!"}
{"text":"My favourite izakaya in Toronto. All the locations are good but I come to this one the most often. The vibes are great and the workers are super friendly. The only downside is that when they're busy they're not that good with filling up water.  Food recommendations: - karage - sashimi salad - udon  Drink recommendations: - all the alcohol drinks with ramune - the drink specials on the paper menu  - sake bomb ($3 on wed and thurs  Definitely make reservations if you're planning to come!"}
{"text":"Been here many, many times over the years and love the energy, atmosphere and consistent high quality food. This is a great place to take friends and family, for casual or special occasions. I especially like that they play traditional Japanese music in the bathroom and have brought my grandparents here for lunch so that they could experience that as well. The restaurant is a lot quieter during lunch. It can get pretty loud for dinner.   Here are some of my favourites from the menu:  Karaage Gindara Kaisen Natto Yukke Ebimayo Salmon Oshizushi  Almond Tofu   It can get pretty pricey if you order a lot of dishes, but if you order fewer dishes that are larger portions (you can usually tell by the picture), it can still be pretty filling.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Kinka because I religiously go to a different izakaya but my friends convinced me to go somewhere different for once.   Let's start off with..........our pitcher of Sapporo. There was a dead fly in it and we told our server which seemed really confused to do but ended up getting us a new pitcher which took about 15 mins to come back to us.   Anyways moving onto food! Sashimi Salad - I liked the different types of sashimi in the salad but didn't enjoy the wasabi mayo which turned me away from this dish  Salmon Tataki - Pretty good, nothing too exciting because it tasted like normal sashimi to me  Ebimayo - I recommend!! Big shrimps served with spicy mayo and lettuce which was refreshing  Bulgogi Bibimbap - not my favourite, the beef was cooked then put into the stone bowl where it continued to cook and became rubbery and tough but other than that the rice was good  Salmon Oshizushi - My favourite thing at Kinka!   Lastly I had high expectations for the last dish (don't know why but I did)  Kakimayo - one of the biggest disappointment because I couldn't even find the piece of oyster. You'd think it being a big shell there would be a noticeable piece but all I saw was mushroom mayo and cheese. No sign of the oyster or spinach  Kinka is good but not my go to izakaya"}
{"text":"Very upbeat and happy environment. The servers are all super friendly and ready to serve you. The price you pay is an exchange for the quality of the food even though portions may be smaller than expected. Overall, its a two thumbs up~   Two best dishes: Lobster sashimi + Grilled Cheese Oyster"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Something which was missing at uptown Toronto. Food is hit and miss. You gotta know Japanese food to be able to order the good dishes."}
{"text":"Went with my grandson on Aug 6/16. We really enjoyed everything we ordered.  Especially enjoyed the deep fried Brie with mango ginger sauce.  I would definitely return  Returned for my Grandson's 17th Birthday on Oct. 2, 2106 We had a party of 8.  Staff was great, food was great and they topped it off with the birthday special which was beautifully presented and delicious! I would totally recommend this place for a different dining experience"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the \"Guu\"/Kinka chain. Food is absolutely phenomenal every time and never disappoints! I have dined twice at this location and I am happy that I no longer have to travel downtown to satisfy my craving.  Keep in mind it is tapas style meaning plates are for sharing... IT SURE ADDS UP but so worth it. They do have daily specials for both drinks and food options!   Staff is extremely friendly and loud (they're supposed to be!!!)... My date and I sat at the bar and the staff were more than happy to teach us basic Japanese :) her and I had tons of fun!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after the place I wanted to go to was not open. Wow am I glad I found this place. Big expansive space for a Japanese Izakaya restaurant with modern decor. I asked to be seated in the back with the booth like area with my little one. Washrooms are clean, large and spacious. Don't believe what you read-this place is fine for kids although I will say day time is probably better suited. We ordered beef carpaccio, chicken karrage, pork belly lunch set, shoyu ramen and oyster motoyaki. Beef carpaccio was sliced too thick but the dish had great flavor. Chicken karaage was a bit fatty and oily. Pork belly as expected this seemed like it was blanched and sauce put on after. Shoyu ramen could've used more toppings. Oyster motoyaki was well done. Nobody does this properly in Toronto but they got it right. For dessert we had black sesame ice cream and hojichi creme brûlée. The desserts were delicious. Cream brûlée was perfect with vanilla and hojichi flavors. Overall great Izakaya place with great potential. I will come back to try the other menu items. Looks like there is a great drink menu and many other menu items."}
{"text":"Went there Boxing Day. Busy but was able to get a seat for two in a short time. Had the option to share table with another two people.   Ordered karage, torched sushi, beef and salmon tataki, kimchi udon , rapini with mushroom, octopus pancake and scallop sashimi. Overall good food and good experience. They greet in Japanese when you enter and leave. The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"There's no good reason to eat here.  I concur with other reviews thus far...food service was painfully slow. I ordered a number of appetizers and main plates. The first arrived after 45 minutes. I was debating leaving. I had to remind my server about my drink order.  As for the food:  Fried Octopus...terrible. I didn't finish it  Sashiimi...pretty good although overpriced. Gentleman sitting next to me returned his lobster sashimi which looked rancid.  Cod...7/10  Sabe...7/10   plus 2 drinks and the bill was $90.  Overall, terrible overpriced. I just understand the fever over this chain.   Seriously, for similar money go to Kaaji or Shoto."}
{"text":"i decided to come here for dinner and it was the worst experience. during that time i didn't expect it to be overly busy so i didn't make a reservation for 2-3 ppl. Was greeted at the door and told that the only seating is available outside in the patio. it was a bit chilly but that didnt matter.  The hostess kept coming up to us asking if our friend was coming or not because she was running late.  or else we will have to give up part of the table. i was very surprise that she came up to us a few times being annoyed about us holding a portion of the tables. i ended up telling them that my friend decided not to come because it will be a rush. the hostess immediately pulled the table away from us with such an attitude.   as our food came. there wasnt even enough space to put the dishes. we had to rush eat the food. we looked around and inside the restaurant. there were atleast 20 seats empty the entire time. very disappointed in the poor service provided by Kinka"}
{"text":"Went to Guu again with a few buddies and managed to convince the hostess to give us the patio. You can make reservations on their website via yelp seat me.  The patio was great with perfect weather. It was not as noisy as inside where shouting is encouraged.  Outside at the patio, we were served by a waitress learning Japanese. It was pleasant to have a conversation with friends without the shouting. Our waitress recommended sake and we obliged by ordering their house sake which was nice for the price.  We ate a few dishes but the highlight was the sashimi platter with sweet shrimp, uni and a variety of daily fresh sashimi of the day. The whole gang enjoyed the food but most of all, it was one of the nicest patio. Restaurant is located away from the main road and the staff including our waitress and the manager did a great job recommending dishes."}
{"text":"This Japanese Izakaya is a must try if you have not and you are in the area. The service, food, and interior design was completely flawless, and I will be visiting this place again in the near future.  1. Food (5/5)  At Kinka (formerly known as Guu), I tried the Takoyaki ($5.50), Karaage ($8.30), Sushi Oshizushi, Gyu Shabu Salad ($8.30), and the Kakimayo ($8.50).  There was simply no complaints over the food at all. Between the 5 dishes that we ordered between two people, I personally recommend the Karaage and the Kakimayo. The Karaage is the best I've ever had in Toronto and Kakimayo is perfect for anyone that loves seafood and some baked cheese. ALL THESE FOODS ARE MUST TRIES. Come in a party of 4 or 5 to get the most out of the experience.  In terms of fullness, with 5 dishes, another person and I were decently full, although we would still be able to eat.    2. Service (5/5)  The service was simply flawless. The servers were very enthusiastic and you can tell that they were very energetic despite all the energy they use whenever they scream when someone either enters or leaves the restaurant. They paid lots of attention to your comfort and strived to make your experience unforgettable. Probably one of the top customer service at a restaurant in Toronto. Simply amazing.  3. Ambience (4.5/5)  The ambience and interior design of the restaurant is stellar. You really feel the Japanese Izakaya culture when you are here. My personal recommendation is that you sit inside, as opposed to outside. Sitting outside is nice but you don't get the full blast of the loud yelling and excitement you feel in the staffs' voices. However, it does get a bit hard to talk to your own group of friends because of the sheer volume in the place.  Overall (5/5)!!!  Note: You can't book by phone, so try to book online with Yelp at least 1 day in advance. In terms of waits, if you are with a group greater than 3 people, you will probably need to book to get the most out of it."}
{"text":"This place offers a subtle yet stylish atmosphere.  From the moment you walk in you'll experience the high energy from hollering staff and chefs.  This place isn't the ideal spot for a quiet romantic dinner but it serves its purpose if you're looking for a unique and delicious meal.   The deep fried Octopus balls are exquisitely cooked and rich with flavour with an addictive scrumptious texture.  The spicy Negitoro is decedent with the perfect balance of flavour and spice and perhaps my favourite was the Kakimayo,  a baked oyster filled with mushrooms spinach mayo and cheese...  Oh the cheese.  All wonderfully presented with friendly and fast service.  A must visit for foodies alike."}
{"text":"This guu is completely different than the other one on church. Or should I say 'kinka izakaya..'? I'll never get used to saying that.. this one seems to be a bit bigger with much harsher lights. The ambiance is exactly the same, with the loud yelling.. does anyone wonder if they're yelling real phrases or just yelling random japanese words because they're so tired of it? We made our reservation and it was great that they sat us as soon as it was time, even though the rest of our party wasn't here yet (the other guu won't do that)   The area we were in was in the back of the restaurant, where it was very hot due to the harsh + bright lighting. We also had to take off our shoes for an authentic japanese experience. Our server, Brandon, was extremely friendly and trés mignon ;) we ordered a lot of food and drinks and they were able to accommodate it all with an appropriate amount of time. The dishes I ordered were all delicious, especially the yaki udon, which was very filling and creamy. I also enjoyed the beef tataki dish, which left me wanting more. The last thing I ordered was the matcha cheesecake, which was very flavourful and creamy. All our group members had something to drink, and they were all unique and very well mixed. The cassis peach oolong (see pic) was amazingly fruity and tasted like an adult candy.. it can be very dangerous especially if you order a few.. I think all of us enjoyed our meals, except the calamari, which tasted a bit sour and the taste was just.. off. Overall, minimal complaints for the food. \"So guuuuu'd\"   I didn't like was the uncomfortable seating, with the blaring lights that eventually brought on a migraine. The only other thing is that there are no separate bills, which makes it extremely difficult to divide through when there's a big party.. we spent over 20-30 minutes trying to determine each person's total with the tip/tax that's already included.   Another thing already mentioned in my tip- they charged the 15% gratuity after they charged the tax.. which many restaurants' ethics goes against.. it's a bit shady but whatever?"}
{"text":"Been there twice this year. First time with my guys and second time with my wife. Very unique Japanese Izakaya atmosphere. Love their food and they always come hot and quick. Reserve your table to avoid long wait. If you don't want to be in the middle of the crowd, ask to be seated in the far side (closer to the washroom) or if you have a large group, there are larger tables toward the end as well. (reservation would help)"}
{"text":"Food was great, but the atmosphere is terrible. The music was so loud, our entire table of 5 were complaining, as well as the table beside us. Guu Izakaya plays their music louder than salsa clubs. I asked if they could turn the volume down because so many people were complaining, but they said they could not do that.   The seating is cramped and it was hard to eat comfortably. The people in my group are considered slender and it was difficult to fit the 5 us at the 4 seat table they gave us. I cannot imagine how much discomfort a normal sized person would experience in such cramped settings.   A great meal ruined by poor spacing and loud music. I won't go back."}
{"text":"An uptown Guu horray! been to this location 3 times because its so much easier than going downtown. At the back corner of the Hullmark Centre it is easy to get to by subway literally right above the subway, there is also underground parking which is $6 or free with a $15 purchase from Whole Foods.   Same loud greetings as the other locations, but this one the lighting is much brighter, nice large windows leading out the patio. The wait without a reservation is not bad at all (but the only option you will get is the bar, which I actually suggest to see all the kitchen action) The longest I've waited in about 25 minutes, once no wait at all and seated right away. However there is a 2 hr seating time limit.   Drinks: Ruby - beer, grapefruit juice and a bit of gingerale, super yummy sweet and refreshing, a girly beer drink! Ramune mojioto is alway delicious my go to drink.   The food is mostly the same, the beef carpaccio, takoyaki and salmon tataki is what you expect and solid as usual. The not so great dishes were one of their daily specials was a grilled squid which was ok a bit bland and pumpkin croquette with a hard boiled egg inside it was just smothered in thousand island sauce and didn't look appetizing   The highlights though was another daily special which was an octopus carpaccio which was bold in flavour lots of spicy jalapeno and different seaweed textures (a party in your mouth) The pressed sushi was also amazing (a bit pricey) but the rice was soft and the fish was torched it comes in both salmon and mackerel. The mushroom and cheese bimbimbap is also always good. I'll keep coming back since the location is convenient, never have a problem with the staff and I always leave satisfied =)"}
{"text":"Guu is relatively new to the North York hood, but my husband and I have still managed to visit this place  a handful of times. Super fun atmosphere; house music blasts through the speakers, and not to mention the constant 'chanting' that goes on here (no way to describe this, but when you go, you know..)  This is definitely not the place you take your parents for a quiet dinner, however it IS really fun for a first date, or a dinner with some fun (and open-minded) friends. Their cocktails are incredible and unique--on my last visit I had a Lychee Sake Martini that blew my mind--and the food is fresh and absolutely authentic. You won't eat anything here that came out of a can or box.   Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving this location 5 stars is the service. Due to the fact that this place is 100% packed to capacity every night, the servers have a tendency to totally forget you ordered a banana tempura 30 minutes ago, or forget about your table altogether. I've heard rumors that the downtown location is a bit better with their service, but all in all, Guu North York is definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Guu! Another expansion into North York this time, much closer to where I live!  No more downtown driving!!  This Guu is a little bigger than the Bloor one but not as big as the Church one, but regardless, this location has good spacing with a nice patio.  Their menu is pretty much the same as the Church Guu, which is good, because I already know what to order!  If you are a first at Guu, you must try what i consider as their top 3 items!  Kimchi Udon, Kinoko Bibimbap and Maguro Tataki!  The vibe is very similar to the other two location, similar materials used for chairs and tables and always LOUD, every staff pretty much yells whenever you enter the restaurant, leave, order something special or have a birthday person in the table, which can make the experience better or worst depending if you mind people yelling out loud around you!  4 stars for this Guu location, only because I took away one star because one of the staffs did not know what he put down on our table.  He said Kimchi Udon, but it was clearly salmon on rice. lol"}
{"text":"PLEASE GET ATHUL. HE'S THE BEST WAITER. Food was good, drinks were tasty, service as AMAZING. Our waiter was super accomodating and fun. Super fun Wednesday night"}
{"text":"The service was so bad. They have 2-hour policy, which I can understand. The thing is not even hit 1.5 hr, the server started to give you the bill. We haven't finished the dishes yet. Once we finished the dishes, another server came and tried to give us the bill, which is so annoying. The thing is two servers even pointed our table and let each other know that they should go. Every server was so rush and there were so many available seats there....we finished the dinner and left immediately... it was like 1.5 hr. Definitely will not go there again. It's my worst experience in Canada."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere Everything I ordered was delicious  Ramen, beef short rib, pork belly, sashimi platter"}
{"text":"My favourite Izakaya. I highly recommend the chicken karaage & kakimayo. They're consistent and it always tastes amazing. A little loud but it's a part of the experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite izakaya spots! Karage and torched sushi are delicious. Kimchi rice was awesome too but they took it off their menu a while ago. And the patio's a nice spot to chill during the summer."}
{"text":"First time here with friends. Place was packed ! During Halloween time. The floor manager Brandon is amazing! Funny guy, very humble and very accommodating. He kept checking up on us to see if we were okay.   Ordered alot of food (Octopus balls, pancakes, Bibimbap) just for examples. Everything was amazing and so good.  During our dinner, all the lights turned off and the servers started dancing to thriller.  It was very fun, everybody is so fun and friendly.   This place is amazing. Fun and friendly environment   Thanks to everybody there. Had a great first experience.  Recommend it to everybody ! Will be back  Did I mention they say hello and goodbye in Japanese when you enter and leave ? Such a beautiful gesture."}
{"text":"not a big fan of guu in downtown because the wait too long and people is giving so high review on it. but this particular gives me surprise, the menu is very close, food is as good as well. But this place is much bigger and the environment is good. They have a patio section, a regular table section and a off the shoe section.  Their washroom is very nice, you will have to check it out if you ever go there. They provide things like pad and mouthwash."}
{"text":"I visited the North York location for the first time and loved it ! Personally, I prefer this location over the downtown church street location. Their service was amazing !! I think I received all my orders within 10 minutes . It was also a Friday night when I visited so it was very busy. The lobster sashimi was on the specials menu so I ordered it and it is to die for !! YUM."}
{"text":"What used to be called Guu has now branched out to become Kinka however supposedly they've kept  similar menu items when it operated at GUU. Nonetheless this location is convenient located at Yonge and Sheppard, so via bus, subway and car, this is easy to get to. Venue wise! The place is busy and it's hard not to be noticed upon entry and exiting the restaurant as you'll be loudly greeted...I mean loudly greeted by every single staff member yelling welcome and thank you (in Japanese). On summer nights they've got a nice patio or you've got the indoor option with ton of traditional Japanese decor everywhere. For starters we had their...... presentable and delish! Served with seaweed it makes for a fun meal. **Drinks we had their Sake bomb $5 was a great way to start the evening off! **Appetizer; Salmon Natto Yukke; 4/5 Salmon, eggs, green onions, garlic crisps mixed together and served with seaweed tacos...kinda like a tartar with crostinis. Beware!! though this dish tastes good, the smell of it may turn you off.  **Bimbibap kinoko 5/5; Beautifully presentable, full of flavor, rich mushrooms, cheese. **Kimchi udon 4/5, not al-dente but definitely nice and soft, beautifully presented and flavor infused with the kimchi added some nice kick to the dish. it almost felt like eating a sticky Asian cabonara. **Makimayo - 4.5/5: Oyster full of cheesy spinach mushroom flavor. The dish looked as great as it tasted.  Overall great place that I would recommend all to try at least once. This may not be my traditional tapas preference, but its worth the culinary experience."}
{"text":"Food quality is always consistent. Staff are very friendly and hospitable. The fried chicken is awesome and the baked oysters are fire. Sashimi salad is pretty good and the salmon sashimi w/ seven friends is... interesting. ^^"}
{"text":"This place has good food, drink creations, and ambiance. However, the orders took too long to be placed and brought to table. It can get very loud with birthdays and greetings. Not the best place for conversation. It's a 3.5 overall."}
{"text":"3.5 stars..  Didn't end up getting the chance to try during their soft opening so did it after their official opening...  This location is definitely bigger than the one downtown in terms of seating...I liked their patio slightly more than the dt one...  If you're a regular use to Izakayas, you wouldn't mind the noise level...I personally love the way vibe and atmosphere becuz it's more unique..=D  It was quite full on a Friday night, as expected, and we arrived closer to 10ish so alot of the items we wanted were already sold out...BOOO...  We just ordered practically almost every item on the menu except for the ones being sold out...the thing with eating at Izakayas is that all of the dishes come out so small and if you are looking to fill yourself up...be prepared to break your bank..I don't think this is a place where you want to eat until you're stuffed...not a guud idea...  I will definitely be back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I could never go wrong with Guu.  There are MANY reasons to eat here.  The 3rd Guu location in Toronto, this one boasts a very sleek, rustic and spacious patio.  The evening was wet with plenty of rain, we did not get to see it in action. But, it's on my list of things to do once the weather clears up.  We were told of a 1 hour wait for our party of three. However, after wandering for about 15 minutes in the nearby Whole Foods, we were called and told that our table was ready! Awesome!  We were seated by the bar in full view of the kitchen. Our usual favourites from Guu are all here.  Kakimayo, yaki udon, karaage, takoyaki, lobster tail sashimi accompanied by a huge mug of Sapporo. The quality of the food, definitely replicated with its savoury, big bold flavors, just like the service itself.  This not your usual, typical Japanese restaurant.    Last, but not least, what makes Guu, well \"Guu\" - is that boisterous welcoming greeting from all members of the staff upon entering the door, and the biggest, loudest happy birthday celebratory sing off in your life by the entire staff and all of the restaurant - have your birthday here, and experience it for yourself!  As always with the other locations, service is provided with a smile.  Food was brought to our seats quick on this Friday night, no more than 15 minutes for our orders of 8 dishes. We were seated at the bar and noted a few familiar faces working the kitchen from their other locations.  You know you love an eatery when you can pick out certain faces from the staff.  I think this is the biggest Guu in Toronto thus far, or comes close to the size of Sakabar without the tatami room.  This location however, did have a room that itself was semi-separated from the rest of the restaurant. Looks very inviting for an enclosed party that could seat 30 guests!  Parking is a bit hard to find, free, maybe street locally nearby (not sure) or underground for $6 flat rate after 5pm weekdays, maybe even week nights.  I'm glad and excited that we no longer have to wander downtown for our monthly Guu visits.  Definitely want to check out that patio soon though!    Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is flowing with excitement and energy! Great place to hang with friends over the weekend and share some of their delicious menu items. We ordered a plethora of items, most of which we enjoyed. Highly recommend that you get the oyster and chicken karaage. Service was quite quick overall considering it was a weekend, servers were nice. Our night ended with a complimentary cup of frozen grapes, quite opposite of your ordinary mint.  Overall a great place to hang but it does get packed  on the weekends and you may find yourself sharing a table with other guests. It does get a bit loud and rowdy here so stay clear if you're looking for a quiet night out."}
{"text":"Good place to eat . Usually come here for the lunch menu . The fried chicken is one of my faves . Never failed me yet :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could afford to eat here more often because the food is really tasty!  It is really loud in Kinka, but that's how most izakayas are; it's a happy-loud environment.  We ordered Kakimayo (baked oysters), deep fried Brie cheese with mango sauce, Kaarage, Yaki Udon, amd Kinoko Bibimbap. Everything was really good, but that udon was what stood out to me the most. I would go back just to have it again. It was so rich with beef flavour and had just the slightest bit of spicy kick. Sooo good.   The Brie cheese was very interesting, it was good but I think it needed more of the mango sauce. There are only four pieces per plate and our group just inhaled everything.  Two of us got the Cherry Blossom cocktail, it was really good, but there was maybe three sips in each of our glasses. It was like they made one and then poured half into a second glass and served it. Kind of disappointing.  I think the quality of the food is the same as the original location and it being located closer to uptown is definitely a plus. Bring some fun people and you'll definitely have a good time."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this joint when they were still Guu. They had a variety that can impress anyone. My all time favourites are:  Salmon tataki  Seaweed tofu salad Octopus balls  Short ribs  My first experience at this location wasn't good, so I was hesitant about coming here again.  I feel like service has gotten better since the first time I was here.  Now to the bad news. I ordered a beef tar tar (usually it's my favourite dish of all) which I couldn't eat because the meat was dark and had smelled funky. The waitress didn't even look at it when I said its bad, saying 'it's the sauce'. Even though the chef apologies I felt a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I like this place for drinking and snacking and its boisterous atmosphere. Definitely not a place to have a full on dinner though.   There are a few standout dishes like the kaki-mayo, cheese mushroom bibimbap, salmon natto yukke. The 'good' dishes would be their yaki udon, miso glazed black cod and tako wasabi.   I really like their lobster sashimi but its seasonal.   The patio is a lot quieter than the inside for a more 'intimate' experience but they close off seating and food earlier than the rest of the restaurant.  I'm glad that there is this kind of restaurant in the area - trendy, upscale, fun, exotic... This restaurant is the only one that fits the bill other than MeNami."}
{"text":"I hosted a large party here this past weekend. Worked with the hall manager to arrange the event - he blocked off an entire area for us which was nice. He kept in constant communication with me prior to the event and preordered one of their expensive Sake's that was so smooth!  The food was excellent. The servers were disorganized, but for that large of a party I don't blame them. We had the tasting menu and I really enjoyed all the dishes. They serve ice cream at the end and the black sesame one is really good! If you haven't been here before, I would recommend the tasting menu with some additional dishes on the side.  They have a time limit of 2 hours, but didn't kick us out right away. It was busy but I never felt pressured to leave (if anything - felt so bad for taking up so many tables).   It's LOUD in there. Fun drinking environment. Parking is annoying, but it's inevitable in the area."}
{"text":"The design of interior and exterior looks exactly like the 2 other locations down town, as well as the atmosphere.  It is located right at the intersection of Yonge and Sheppard, so it's not hard to find. There's also a underground parking right by it, same parking lot as Whole Foods. It takes awhile when you're trying to exit though because you have to insert your ticket at the exit then pay there too.  The interior is extremely small, it has only 5 long tables, sitting max. 8 people per table. On the other hand, their patio is much bigger than inside, which I find great when it's nice during the summer times, but definitely hard to get a seat in the cooler weathers.   We went on a Wednesday night at around 10pm with a reservation, but the place was almost dead, less than 10 customers in the restaurant, which I find very surprising for a newly opened popular franchise.   We got served quickly with a sheet of paper which is their special's menu, regular menu and a drinks menu. As we were deciding what to order, no one came around asking us for drinks or even bringing us some water, this was at least 15 mins after sitting down. We ordered a couple of small dishes to share as well as a pitch of Sapporo. There were 5 of us and we were told that a pitch will be enough for each one of us to get a glass. As she brought over the pitcher and poured it for us, they fill the first 3 mugs full but by the time she got to the last 2, it was clearly not enough to fill both mugs full. So she poured 60% for the remaining 2 mugs, which then a WTF popped into my head.. If it wasn't enough to fill 5, then don't tell us that in the beginning, and don't fill up the first 3 mugs so full that it's not even. We couldn't pour it out of the fuller mugs to even it out, so it was very awkward.  The dishes were up to par, didn't taste as good as the locations down town though. The portion sizes of the food were also small for the price we were paying. We ordered a kimchi udon for the cost of $10 and it was only enough for a bit shared between 5 people and it wasn't worth the money for just very little diced kimchi and very little udon.  We also ordered a cod that was way too salty which we took 2 bits and that was it.  The server never checked on us after giving us the food and only came by when she gave us the bill.  She was very nice and friendly but minimum service was given.   I was disappointed overall, 2 dishes of what we ordered were disappointing. The price and quality or quantity of food was imbalanced. Service was minimum. I wouldn't go back again, at least not to this location especially."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday with my cousin and between the two of us, we were super hungry so we ordered a variety of dishes. So much food to the point where the waiter had to give us an extra table and we had to ask them to slow down the orders.   They gave us the option to sit either outside at the patio or inside towards the back where they sit on a bench and you have to take off your shoes. The patio would have been nice but unfortunately it was a little cold at night so we opted for I door seating.   First thing I noticed was that it was EXTREMELY loud and I would have to yell even if I was trying to speak to the person in front of me. The servers and waiters would yell things I did not understand when people walked in or out and there were many birthday celebrations.   The food was delicious but some portions I found a tad small for the price that we paid for. I would however, come back once every so often.   The service was good. The servers were attentive and cleared up our table whenever necessary, however our waiter...there seem to have been only one waiter taking care of the entire back section that night..she was so busy running around that it was quite hard to grab her attention and she rarely paid attention to us."}
{"text":"i rate this place as a average sushi restaurant. So i reserved a table on Valentine day at 8 30pm. I literally got to the restaurant at 8 25pm which for me that is the best time to arrive, not too early and not late. Apparently not..first, the host told us that we re early. second he wanted us to wait in the lobby because APPARENTLY there's too many people waiting in the restaurant (clearly there's plenty of rooms for two more ), and as all of you know, its pretty dam cold. In the end we waited in the lobby but then the next couple who came in after us get to stay inside to wait. That pissed me off a bit.   so finally getting to the part of seating. I requested a decent two spot table to be reserved since its Valentine date as a special request from website. The host called us in and wanted me to share table with other individuals (side by side). i understand that the restaurant is busy but please ask if its ok? i personally does not want to share table with strangers on a date? The host altitude was very bossy. This is his respond when i say i would like to have a regular two seat table. : There's no other table right now,  you don't want it ill give it to the next group. The reply might not look bad in paper, but when you use a bossy tone and looks down on your customer then it cause problem. In the end we ended up sitting on the bar, (i requested). My date was that close to leave the restaurant.  That is all the bad stuff happened that DAY. The food was decent, taste good. (dont compare with jabistro)   The waitress was nice, small mistake in taking order which is ok. 6 dish after tip cost around 70-80. I only tip for 10percent.  Therefore, 3star is max ill give for this restaurant, for the food."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the portions are very small for the price. Service is friendly but inconsistent.   I was with a group of 7 people and our server completely missed one person's order. She didn't even notice he hadn't gotten his food and by the time we were able to flag her over, the rest of us had finished and were ready to order more food. I felt he should've received a discount for this oversight, but of course that didn't happen. I know it's tough with a busy restaurant and larger groups, but it's the server's job to ensure everyone at the table is taken care of.   The place is extremely loud with all the shouting, which makes it very difficult to hear anyone if they are speaking at a normal level. I don't particularly enjoy having to shout across the table to be heard. It can be a fun spot if you don't mind all the noise, but it's definitely not a place to go if you want conversation."}
{"text":"we wait for the unagi bibimbap for 40 min and the waiter attitude is so bad?Idon't get it ?I have been here for over 30 times?but the attitude is getting worse and worse ?it is time to say good bay"}
{"text":"Cool place, definitely one of a kind type of place, unique experience! Food was good, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Personalized reservation card is impressive. Lots of daily specials to try. Fun and busy place to try. We are told to have 2hours to eat and they keep reminding us well before the time. Good for group and family to share but don't expect to get filled with those small dishes."}
{"text":"Great place, the tofu is so good even the almond tofu dessert. Basically all the food come in at the right timing and carbonara udon and oysters is a must try."}
{"text":"My favourite lunch place on the weekend! Although Izakayas are known for the crowd and the noise, I prefer coming here for lunch on the weekend because I get to enjoy traditional Japanese teishoku at peace. Teishoku is a pre-set meal that includes a main dish (usually a protein), a bowl of rice, miso soup and some small dishes by the chef's choice. I always go for the pork belly teishoku, a side of sashimi and my favourite kakimayo. 5 stars for their food and service! In addition to the lunch menu, they also offer some of the favourites on their dinner menu so it's the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Newly opened North York location. Same quality as downtown ones and equally good, loud, vibes. If they have it that week, try the jumbo shrimp sashimi on the special menu."}
{"text":"Very loud but welcoming restaurant. The food was all delicious especially the bibimbop and the pan fried udon. It's best to make reservations for this location. There is apparently certain dishes that are available at this location and not the others such as the pork belly dish. Overall a satisfying dine in, but just a wee bit too loud."}
{"text":"Food here is very different than the ones in other izakayas.  They are quite expensive but you get what you paid for.  I really liked their pressed salmon sushi.  Their grilled cod is really good too.   Their service is actually quite bad.  They keep missing our orders and never fills our drinks.  They would take our tea pot and never come back with it.  They didn't just missed our orders once but a few times.  Food is good but they should do something about their service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere & food.  One of the best Japanese restaurants uptown.  Friendly and outgoing staff.  Japanese owned.  Fresh sashimi.  Decent pricing.  Definitely one of my go to jap places."}
{"text":"By far my favourite place to eat whenever I'm in Toronto! The decor is beautiful and food is spectacular. Highly recommend the okonomiyaki if you're a fan of tako yaki."}
{"text":"I've waited a few months after their grand opening to go, so that it would give them time to adjust before I write a review - this was because many of the previous reviews were either really good or really bad. Here's what I think...   Food - we ordered Unagi bibimbap, Kakimayo (baked oysters), Gindara (seared black cod), Gyu Carpaccio (beer carpaccio), Saba Oshizushi (blowtorched salmon sushi), and off the daily special menu - sashimi scallops, and oden (soup). The bibimbap was nothing special, I actually love the Kinoko Bibimbap (mushroom and cheese) one a lot more. Baked oysters were just as good as the other locations, the Ginadara was great - best I've had from Guu (including the two other locations) thus far. We really enjoyed the carpaccio, especially the fried garlic that it's topped with. The blowtorched salmon looked delicious, but didn't have any special taste to it, not sure if I would order that or the Unagi bibimbap again. Scallops were fresh and tasty, we were not a huge fan of the oden soup, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. Overall most of the food was really delicious! But I somehow remember the Bloor St. location to have better tasting food, not sure why.   Service - I think I saw 4 servers. It looks like only one person may be designated to the patio (of course i could be wrong), because I saw many of the patio patrons waiting to order but there was only one person tending to the tables out there. We were seated right inside the window (not on the patio), and we got pretty good service. I remember reading reviews from other people and many of them noted the slow service, however I'm happy to say I did not experience that. In fact we were in and out in an hour and somewhere in between, the waitress gave us new plates and cleared out all the empty dishes without us noticing much and refilled out waters. It was good service!   Ambiance - It's really loud in here, to the point where you have to speak very loudly, almost yell, in order to be heard by the person across the table, I get this is the Guu atmosphere, but I don't recall the other locations being this loud. The lights are WAY brighter then at the other locations - not at all similar to the other two locations, but I didn't mind this because it doesn't take away from the casual izakaya vibe. Aside from the ultra high volume, I'm a fan of the ambiance.    Overall it's a 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This is prob my second or third time going to Guu Izakaya. I've been to the one at Church St, but my first time at the North York location. The restaurant itself is much bigger than the downtown location and has a nice patio section. The inside is communal type wooden tables and benches, and typical loud, screaming, noise with the staff talking to each other and welcoming guests.  The food was decent. Nothing was amazing, aside from the deep fried brie cheese melting in your mouth (and giving you a heart attack). Here's what I remember that we ordered: deep fried chicken, spinach w/ black sesame sauce, blowtorched salmon, baked oyster, and a bunch of other stuff. It was probably half of the menu items. While the food was okay, the service was lacking. It's slow, and seemed to be understaffed for the type of business that you expect at Guu. Had to ask for drink refills several times. Dishes started taking a long time to come out (20+ min). When we ordered the sashimi special ($60), it was missing the sea urchin. They eventually brought it out separately (which didn't taste fresh) and just left a poor experience for us since you expect more from an expensive meal."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, I have been there twice, upsetting food experience both times - real disgrace to Japanese food...  Cool hang out though if you are not there for the food.  I remember visiting the original Kinka and it was a much better experience.  This location is destroy the restaurant brand..."}
{"text":"I was excited that a new Guu was opening close to my home so I went during their soft opening this week. As hyped up as the atmosphere in this restaurant was when I visited, it's nothing out of the ordinary from their other two Toronto location.   I've dined at all the Guu restaurants, including JaBistro regularly since they first opened up but over the past year, I've visited them less frequently as competitors popped, as well, I felt overall, the food, value and service has gone downhill. (It's a disappointing trend of many popular restaurants that have been successful enough to expand in the city. )   The food was ok, but I felt the portions were tiny, and presentation lacking. ( not to mention, why so much garnish???)   Because I'm already wary, I visited the new location just to check it out. Got the maguro tataki, pressed seared salmon sushi, kimchi udon and karrage. ( note, karrage at the ramen places like Kinton is actually better than Guu an costs less)   service: the worst I've seen. I feel generally bad for servers but during 45 mins of dining, I repeated saw ppl asking about missed plates and the table next to me as well as my table was brought the wrong dish at least 2 times.   Hope they really pick things up, the space itself is very nice, modern and more spacious than other locations."}
{"text":"Not as pleasurable as my experience at the other Guu restaurants. The service was not the greatest but the food was still good as I have come to know from their restaurants. Maybe it was an off night for them. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is psychology or what but Kinka's food quality and service Is just not as good as when it first opened as Guu. the takoyaki octopus balls were over cooked and it almost felt like it was deep fried. Service was terrible and we waited 45mins for our yaki udon and then the waitress decides to shove the bill to us asking us to leave when out seating time was up. Overall it was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times now, last night was a friend's birthday. Our server was amazing and the place is always filled with energy and positive vibes. When we asked other staff besides our server, we do not get what we asked for, they totally just agree to whatever we request such as more menus and or water and just walk away. The food on the other hand: it's a major disappointment. The flavour is whatever, it's okay I guess. There's nothing special to it."}
{"text":"food is terrible and definitely overpriced . we ordered around 200$ and I asked the waiter to change one of our meals that was like 10$. the manager came to our table and she was very rude. I have never seen a manager in a restaurant so rude. she didn't change the food and left. never going there again even though its right under my building"}
{"text":"Does this place know how to run a restaurant ? They spilt the liquid off the plates when taking it away and couldn't pour beer if their life was on the line as half the cup was foam. On top of that they asked us to move tables in the middle of our dinner so that they can sweep the area ...  The only thing going for them is the food is decent.  The downtown Toronto area is MUCH better"}
{"text":"Only ordered takeout here but food was very good. Gyoza is nice and crisp and the sauce complements well. The calamari was nicely done and not chewy. Suggest asking for sauce on the side as there is a bit too much. Ordered 3 times and quality has been good each time."}
{"text":"Been going to all the Kinka locations and I must say never a disappointment!  Great service, food is fresh to order and such a lively ambiance!  A must try!  Looking forward to coming back during patio weather!"}
{"text":"I used to love Kinka/Guu for their food, their service and the atmosphere. But I have to admit that they no longer give me that WOW factor I used to have when I step into their restaurants. They are definitely slipping from where they were once at. And one of the 3 stars is given purely based on nostalgia.    The food is really just mediocre. The menu is very much the same from a few years back, with a few specials here and there. And do expect that at least two or three of those items will be sold out by the time you place your order any time after 8PM on a weekend. We ordered the beef salad, grilled cod fish, karaage, makarel pressed sushi, tuna tartar and the pork shoulder.  Unfortunately, there really isn't a single outstanding dish that I could rave about, which is frustrating for a place I used to really enjoy eating at.  The service was fine, the staff was attentive for the most part. But I really didn't love the crazy screaming inside the restaurant. I understand it is a part of their culture, and it is a welcoming gesture for their guests. However, I don't think it is necessary to scream at their top of your lungs. Our ears were ringing by the time we ordered our food. It was so bad that we had to move outside to their patio for some peace and quiet. I get it that this is an izakaya and it is meant to be loud, but all I am trying to say is that it could be toned down just a tad bit. I do think some customers would appreciate not having to yell at the top of their lungs to converse with their party. But again, that's just my opinion.   The food scene in Toronto/GTA has flourished immensely in the past few years. There are so many great options and selections out there. And I don't think Guu/Kinka will be one of the restaurants I will be revisiting any time soon"}
{"text":"Really amazing sushi dish! I love Izakaya restos! And the sapporos are always a must have. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Guu was my introduction to izakayas so it does have a special place in my heart. Perhaps I'm rating this location with a higher standard and its partly my fault for ordering the kinkalicious special but I came back home thinking I could've spent my money better elsewhere. Service was alright although it was slightly harder to get the server's attention if you sit in the back. The kinkalicious special basically was a sampler type of course. The salad was too heavily dressed (too salty), although the portions were good. The fried course was basically one piece of fried chicken and takoyaki per person, portions were definitely disappointing but it tasted alright. Grilled cheek skewers are not that great... Honestly I could've cooked it better. There was a layer of fat on one side that was not even rendered crispy. Oysters were great as usual. The bimbimbap ensures that you are full at the end, I think it was alright but it's not my thing. Sashimi with lobster and scallop was the star of the show, there was a decent amount of lobster tail - I was pleasantly surprised! The course ended with green tea ice cream - I really don't think this should be included as a course but it's one of the courses according to the menu. It tasted like hime green tea ice cream and the scoop was not that big. Overall, mediocre for the price - I think the regular sampler menu is better (unless you really want to eat sashimi) and next time I will just order from the regular menu instead."}
{"text":"5 stars because the food, atmosphere and service were great! For those who don't know, when you enter the restaurant you get \"yelled\" at and a lot of people get surprised. But the whole staff including the cooks greet you in Japanese (very excitedly) when you walk in the door and the same when you leave.   When you order a sake bomb, the staff come around your table and shout the chants and it makes everyone in the restaurant join in. It's exciting when everyone interacts!  We came for a little birthday get together and this place is great when you're having drinks because their menu has a lot of shareables. The Brie cheese was super gooey and crispy mm and the katage waa so good we ordered extra. I personally didn't drink so I ordered a strawberry lemonade and I do recommend it!  Ordered about 11 items (including drinks) and spent about $130"}
{"text":"4/5:  Contrary to their sister location on Church street, this Kinka Izakaya is well lit and has a more open concept. However, noise level and excitement of the room every time a new customer comes/goes is consistent.   Food was good. Really good. We ordered a bit of everything and it all came out in a timely manner. We came as a group of four so we ended up running through 6 or 7 plates as well as 2 small bottles of sake, 2 cocktails, and one bamboo sake.   Service was good. Thorough and consistent.  All in all a really good experience and, in my personal opinion, a better vibe and atmosphere relative to the Church Street location (which is equally as good)."}
{"text":"we had 5 people and we got 4 nori for takowasa.  we asked for one more and they charge us for it.  Come on.  How cheap is that?"}
{"text":"This review is written by a man who won't eat sushi and prefers sports bars and steakhouses to places where your utensils are two sticks. I ended up at this place for a friend's birthday and it turned out to be a really great time.  When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with a loud cheer from the cook staff. You instantly feel this is a happening place. The servers and cooks seem genuinely happy to see you.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant where you must remove your shoes before sitting on the double wide bench in front of your table.  Service comes quickly, but they don't rush you at all.  Like I said, I'm a steak and potatoes (fully-cooked) kinda guy, but this place has something for everything. I had fried ribs (Karubi), breaded prawns with a spicy mayo (Ebimayo) and an udon noodle dish (Yaki Udon) with mushrooms and beef; the last two were my favourites!  The birthday boy got a special 7 Samurai sake wine delivery. The presentation was awesome and he drank them all for the experience (there was a grimace on his face, however, but I could see this being a big hit with a group of friends).  Overall, this place is certainly unique. It's definitely worth the visit. The only reason that I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of my preference for large serving sizes. If you are looking for a special experience in a place where you can be as loud as you want, this is the place to be.   Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant at least 5 times in the past year and each experience is always great. Service is amazing, love the ambiance and the food is always so good. If you love Japanese food and tapas this place is for you. Baked oysters are recommended if you are stuck on the delicious menu!"}
{"text":"Location is great since its just walking distance from Sheppard/Yonge subway station. Atmosphere very similar to other locations, loud and very welcoming. Service was good. Staff were friendly but not sure most of them knew their own menu fully. Menu selection felt less than the locations downtown. The food was okay. Ventilation could be a little better. Found it quite Smokey at times since we were sitting in front of the kitchen. They have a patio area which is great for the summer. On busy nights, there's a seating limit of 1.5hrs. Will I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends. We ordered different dishes and we loved everything on our table. Especially the eel tempura! The cocktail drinks were awesome."}
{"text":"I am sad to only give it 2 stars. Those 2 stars are acknowledged to the service. The food lost the rest.  Ordered:  - Gyu Carpaccio - no stars (too thick and super chewy that night) - Salmon Tataki - 3 stars, fresh and I love the crispy bits on top for that crunchy texture - Gindara - black cod was super fatty and butter-y. Grilled well - Okonomiyaki - squid pancake, it was tasty and filling - Karubi - Grilled beef short ribs, slices were too thin, but grilled well  Overall the food didn't really make it to my foodie black book. But with that said, the service was super kind and forgiving, and the space (albeit new) is better than any of the other restaurants downtown.   I'd come back only for the ambiance and its close proximity to my home."}
{"text":"Ambiance is amazingly alive! The employees are very into their jobs. The food was outstanding, best japanese i've had ever. The baked oyster is a must have!!! So is the salmon tartar. Absolutely loved everything we ordered. I would come back next time im nearby."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite places to dine in. The restaurant is pretty big as it is only one level. During evening hours, it's always busy inside and outside (parking). If you get lucky you can find parking on the side street just a minute walk from the restaurant.   During their dinner hours it is a wait to be seated, I'm not sure about lunch as I have never been. What's great is that they will ask for your number and shoot you a text/call to let you know your table is ready! The seating is tight as in you can hear your neighbor's conversation. I personally like to sit at the high chairs where you can watch the chefs in action. Oh and how can I forget, once you walk in and exit you are greeted outloud by all the staff in their language.   I definitely recommend getting: Kinoko Bibimbap (ultimate favorite), Salmon Oshizushi (blowtorched salmon? hell yes!), and Ebimayo (ask for extra sauce). I've tried almost every item on the menu and those are my must haves! Also for drinks, the Blue-Chu tastes bomb!  Service is excellent and quick. Servers are very friendly. The atmosphere is loud which I pay no attention to because of how great the food tastes. Overall, you will have a great experience as I always do."}
{"text":"Amazing food & equally great atmosphere!!  Loved the tuna tataki & ikapiri (deep fried calamari w/ wasabi mayo & spicy ketchup).   The Nama Lemon Sour cocktail (vodka, lemon and soda) was so light & refreshing! Very friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. I recently came because the name change with a group of friends and I just found the food very ordinary with a high price tag.  Staff: We had a reservation. The front area is a bit of a mess since it seemed like they didn't have someone dedicated to handling the entrance. It took a while before someone even asked if we had a reservation, however we were seated immediately once they found our reservation and service was prompt. You get the boisterous greeting when you enter and thankfully I wasn't seated at the bar or else I'd probably be irritated by all the yelling.  Ambience: The place is really nice. I enjoyed the furnishing and we were seated in the back where we had to take off our shoes. Like I said before, it is loud but for some reason is was also boiling hot. It was as if someone turned on the heat to a broiling temperature! I didn't get it but after a while (and taking off most of your layers), you might get used to the heat.  Food: I think my biggest disappointment was the food. We had Saba and Salmon Oshizushi (Mackerel and Salmon Sushi) and I think the poor craftsmanship bothered me the most. Some pieces were huge, while others were smaller. Some had a lot of ginger while others had few. And some of them fell apart when you picked them up. We also tried Karaage (Deep Fried Chicken) and Ebimayo (Deep Fried Prawn) and they were both good but nothing that wowed me. I liked the Kurage (Jellyfish) but it wasn't any different than the stuff you get at the supermarket. We also tried the Almond Tofu for desert which was passable but a bit bland. Now the saving grace was the Banana Tempura, which was amazing. It was sweet and had the right amount of batter, plus the accompanying coconut ice cream provided the added texture and flavours to the dish. I would go back just for that dish alone.  Some dishes were alright, but overall for the price I won't be dying to go back any time soon unless I want that Banana Tempura."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  A little on the salty side for some of my friends and myself, but okay for others.  The best deal is their $33 per person package which gives each person around 8 different dishes.  Unfortunately with this package, everyone at the table has to get it.  That was a big turn off for me as one of my friends was pregnant and wanted to order something separate that she could eat.  The cake thing was already a bummer ($30 a cake) but to force a pregnant person to eat a set menu where should couldn't or didnt want to eat most of the items was pretty crummy on their part.  And the only excuse they kept giving us was 'its policy'.  They should really put all this information on their website and also let people know when they call in to book with them.  Overall, the food was pretty good.  But the 'policies' and rules would make me think twice about bringing a big party there next time.  We chose your restaurant to celebrate a special occasion and are willing to pay a premium to be there, but the service, although it was good during dinner, the management should really update and should be willing to bend some rules to keep their clients coming back.  Mixed feelings about going back to Guu."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Perhaps I got lucky with the food and service, or they fixed everything by opening weekend?  I tried out Guu North York this past weekend, after hearing they're opening a branch in uptown. I honestly expected the worst looking at some of the initial reviews, but I honestly had just as awesome of an experience compared to Guu Sakabar (haven't been to the original branch yet).As expected, you are greeted with a loud welcome entrance in Japanese by everyone inside. Ahh yes...the Guu experience. If you complain about that, then this place isn't for you. Turn back now cause it will get even louder as time goes on.  Their menu is largely similar to the other branches, but they do have a few exclusives, as well as some opening specials. I ordered the takowasabi, buta bara, wagyu beef tataki, saba oshizushi, kakimayo, gindara, okonomiyaki, ikapiri, and the black sesame creme brulée.  I really enjoyed the takowasabi (ordered 3 of them at the end!!!), buta bara, kakimayo, gindara, and the black sesame creme brulée. The takowasabi had real wasabi stems, so if you're not spice tolerant, do consider skipping it. The buta bara is exclusive to this branch and has an awesome pork belly taste (somewhat similar to Kinton's pork belly). The kakimayo had a thick cheese coating with plenty of mushrooms and kusshi-sized oysters. The gindara had an excellent miso coating and the cod fish itself was smooth. Finally, the black sesame creme brulée tasted like real black sesame, and was the perfect size for my party of 3 to share.  The wagyu beef tataki, saba oshizushi, and okonomiyaki were also decent, and are good choices if you've never tried them before. I've had better elsewhere, but they're still good nonetheless.  The ikapiri wasn't anything special.  Service was excellent the entire way, but you will have to accept the fact employees have specific roles. The person carrying dishes to serve you will not be the person taking down your order; you have to flag someone who's not carrying a tray with food or drinks, as those people are the ones responsible for taking down your order. They tend to be easy to find so it shouldn't be a huge issue.  So despite the initial poor reviews, I honestly believe this place is just as good as the downtown branches! I'll definitely come back if I don't feel like venturing into the city."}
{"text":"The menus are covered with nice close-up shots of big, delicious, thick meat sliced sashimi BUUUUT what you get is a shocking almost-invisibly-thin-sliced sashimi costing at $7.5 for 7-8 sashimis. Not worth buying. So buyers beware!  Everything else was okay."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing. Guu is usually 4 stars and above for all their Toronto AND Vancouver locations (that I've been to).   The food is all great, blah blah blah. This post is regarding the customer service from my last experience.   I wanted a dessert, but they were ALL SOLD out. Ok. So I brought out a cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu and started eating. Next thing you know, the manager comes and tells me that she's going to charge me $30 if I continue to eat the cake. So as I continue to eat the cake, I explain that:  1) You ran out of dessert 2) When I've been to other locations AND this one at previous times, and parties came to celebrate their birthdays and assumably provided you with a cake purchased outside of the restaurant (unless they reserved in advance and Guu charged them for a cake), that they asked you to bring out, didn't seem like you had any problems with those \"outside\" desserts 3) Are you to tell me that if I was to simply give you the outside cake before the start of our meal, explaining that it was for a \"birthday\" with a candle, that I wouldn't be given this seemingly arbitrary additional cost to eat an outside dessert?  Overall, if not for that experience, the experience would have been a 4. I always go for at least two of their fresh daily specials which generally don't seem to disappoint."}
{"text":"North York location for the well known Guu Izakaya chain, now renamed Kinka Izakaya. I found the restaurant similar quality to the other locations and left satisfied as usual after visiting! Loud and full of energy, upon entry to the restaurant and throughout your meal, you'll face countless loud greetings in Japanese. If you're looking for a quiet restaurant, this is not your place. This is definitely a unique experience to the Kinka chain.   The food is izakaya style consisting of tapa style dishes ranging from Salads, Sashimi, baked/grilled items, rices/udons and more. My favorite dishes are the cheese oysters, the Bibimbap (rices) and the pumpkin dish. Food is tasty and unique. You can't go to an izakaya and not get a drink so I'd recommend grabbing a Japanese beer or trying some of their unique cocktails or sake offerings. I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service good portion for the price I wish they gave dessert complementary for birthdays"}
{"text":"I made a  reservation on Monday. When we are arrived, other customers are arriving too. They don't have reservation, but they are serving the first. My friend and I are still waiting around 10 mins. We are sited a bit from bar.  Some dishes that we ordered are ok."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch yesterday, and must admit I was pleasantly surprised. The sashimi was fresh, delicate, and incredibly tasty. We shared dishes of beef ribs and pork belly, which were superbly prepared. The presentation of all our dishes was beautiful, and the service discreet and efficient. An experience I hope to repeat soon."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Guu franchise. If you're not familiar with Guu, it's a mid to high level Japanese restaurant with lots of fried food, no sushi. Dishes are meant to be shared and a wide variety of items are available. There may be a lot that you don't like if you haven't eaten a lot of traditional Japanese food before, but for those of you that love Japanese food, this is a familiar and upscale choice. The staff are actually Japanese so wave them over if you want something, don't expect them to ask you how you're doing every five minutes.   I've been to all 3 locations in Toronto, and I would say this location keeps up with the Guu tradition."}
{"text":"expensive but good food! Staffs are so lovely and helpful!!! Never been to other locations but here in north york is a great place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, and everything was great. Food was what you'd expect from a Guu-inspired restaurant, with tasty and funky Japanese tapas in a cool setting with enthusiastic wait staff. I had the okonomiyaki, the takoyaki and the cod, and everything was cooked perfectly and covered in flavourful sauce. It was quiet for lunch, probably because of the location. Worth going to though, especially if you don't want to go all the way downtown for Guu :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday and it was still fairly busy so i would definitely recommend reserving seats. The location is amazing as it is right out Yonge and Sheppard subway station and perfect for midtown uptown folks.  The atmosphere is very lively and upbeat. I wouldn't recommend coming here for a deep conversation, you're most likely to be light shouting at each other.  The food was above average and prices are reasonable. Lots of drinks options and small dishes to share. The slight downside is the super LOUD shouting and banging of a gong whenever someone orders a Sake Bomb drink. Aside from that, everything else was good!"}
{"text":"This place has great hype with all the staff screaming out loud every time you order something. The food quality is not that great even though they have some variety. The price is decent but the serving is okay for two people. Reservations were easy to make on the same day knowing this is a pretty busy area. I would come again just for the ambience."}
{"text":"Guu/Kinka is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. My girlfriends and I decided to come here for dinner on a Sunday night and it was nice not having to go all the way downtown for some of our favourite food.  The first thing we got was the salmon tataki for $7.80. It's a seared Atlantic salmon sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo and garlic chips. Everything in this dish, including the radish garnish came together very nicely. I especially enjoyed the garlic chips!  Second on the list was 5 pieces of deep fried oysters. It was part of the daily or weekly special on a separate sheet of paper. I thought that this was quite a disappointment because I really enjoyed their other oyster dish off their regular menu. Next time, I would stick to the kakimyao which is a baked oyster with spinach, mushrooms and garlic mayo topped with cheese.  While we're on the topic of disappointment, my drink was also a disappointment. I got a virgin cocktail - ramune mojito ($6). They charged $3.50 for just the raume so it's already a ripoff. I paid an extra $2.50 for lime and mint so it was a super ripoff. For $6, I expected them to add some sort of extra touches to the drink to make it worth the price.  Third on the list was takoyaki ($5.50). There were 5 pieces of deep fried octopus balls with tonkatsu sauce and karashi mayo. This dish also tasted very standard to me.  Fourth on the list was the ikapiri which is a deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup adn wasabi mayo for $7.50. This was one of the first dishes I've ever ordered from Guu and it's still as good as the first time I've ever had it. I highly recommend that this! The spicy level was just right. Even my friend who normally cannot handle any sort of spicy said it was perfect.  Fifth on the list was the yaki udon. It's a pan fried udon noodles with beef, mushrooms and scallion for $9.30. Again, it tasted very standard to me. I normally enjoyed udon and this was no exception.  Lastly, we got a bibimbap. I usually go for the kinoko bibimbap because I really love the cheese in it. However, they have a new bibimbap on the menu called unagi bibimbap for $11.30. It was one of my favourite dishes of the night. There were small pieces of eel in the dish with burdock and egg in a stone bowl. Either bibimbap is good choice in my opinion.  I'm so glad they opened up this restaurant in North York! I'll definitely be coming here more often for some Japanese tapas."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet. It's unique among the small choices for Toronto Izakaya, but the staff KNOW what they are doing. Service and food is consistently high quality and memorable. I can't recall ever ordering anything on their menu that I didn't like, probably because it's so fresh! They make some great cocktails, too.  This is a great place to bring friends for a change of scene. It's a very loud environment so I recommend sitting outside in the warmer weather, but there's also a certain charm to the boisterous atmosphere on a chilly evening. Bathrooms are private and typically clean."}
{"text":"Kinka izakaya is the new name for Guu. I guess Guu will open its own locations. The address is on Yonge but they are on a bit of hidden bent in a side street. I am impressed by them because despite success and growth of the chain to multiple locations the food is still scrumpanese.. The pork was moist and tasty, the karage was juicy and deep, the salad really fresh and they went all out on the sesame. Since the owner is Korean they have a few Korean dishes on the menu too. The chain's ramen restaurants kinton has become really bad with weak and watery broth that is a crying shame and far from when the original Kinton used to serve deep authentic ramen. The problem has not reached Kinka. The food still has higher standards, perhaps because of the chef who I am pretty sure I used to see at the other Guu locations. One miss: the atmosphere is not like the old days. The noise and enthusiasam level is not like 2012-2013 anymore. it is haphazard and random, goes up and down, maybe that was a Guu innovation. Customers the usual Chinese Korean lot but the staff is all Japanese Music is crappy hip hop, guys try to play some Japanese music."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday night as a party of three. It's was a great experience! Sake bombs were $3!  We ordered a variety of things to share: tofu salad, smoked salmon sashimi, octopus balls, beef ribs, BBQ eel rice dish (forgot the name), and fried okra.  The food was delicious and service was friendly. I knocked off a star because the prices were a little too expensive for the portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Very a authentic Japan style izakaya.  Very loud, mostly shouting from the staff as they greeting new customers and as they yell orders to the chief and he response, then shouts out its really and then the waiter screams in acknowledgment.  This goes on constantly and there is loud hipster music to boot!  If your not uses to it, it can be jarring, but is all part of the fun and normal in Tokyo hip places like Shibya and Shinjuku.  Food is great and so is the cold 2 liter beers.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't want to spoil my review, but I totally love this place! I went with a group for lunch so we ordered quite a few things to share.  My favourites were the perfectly crisp karaage and flavourful pork belly. The gyudon didn't have enough beef for the rice, but taste-wise it was satisfying. Similarly, the takowasabi didn't have enough seaweed and they charge extra... For each piece of seaweed. I felt like the beef short ribs were the most lacking because they didn't have much flavour, and its dipping sauce just tasted like oil. But in general, the food was yummy and reasonably priced.  Now let me tell you about the sake bombs. They were the coolest thing there! All the staff came out to hype it up and made it really fun and not awkward at all. One of them even helped me pour my sake in after I failed to knock it into the cup (laughcry). I don't like fizzy drinks and I hate the taste of alcohol, but the concoction was tolerable.  Bonus point: my best friend is the pickiest eater I know and she raved about this place for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Don't thk this restaurant in this location deserves a star. I was super excited abt this new location. However the service here is unbelievably bad. Firstly, they missed some of our dish. We followed up with the waiter at least three times. The dishes ended up not coming and the service told us it must be us didn't order in the first place. We were like shocked. How would it be possible for a service guy to say it back to customers ? Then the same guy came over said we need to leave now as 2 hour limits had been reached. One of our guy was kinda upset and said that he was not happy and some of our dishes were still not out yet. The guy said back to us \"ok, let me bring you the machine.\" We were alllllll really pissed and we will never come to here again. Last but not least, when we asked him if we couldn't talk to the manger, he claimed himself as the manager of Guu north York. Oh well, super disappointed and mad. It's the restaurant that I will never come back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared a sashimi plater and it was fantastic!  Everything was really fresh and I especially liked the mackerel.  I also recommend the black cod as it was also really yummy.  The place is kind of loud but the staff is super friendly and really attentive.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Kinka!! The quality of the food is always on point and there is always a kind of energy that's flowing through the restaurant.   We were greeted by the whole staff as we walked in (Japanese style). On our most recent visit, we requested a table on the patio. We were seated right away.  We went for the salmon tataki, the torched salmon oshizushi and the baked oysters. The salmon oshizushi never disappoints. The combination of the smoky torched salmon, slightly warm sushi rice and sweet sauce really hit the spot. It was so good we decided to order another.   To finish, we went for the hojicha brûlée. Highly recommended.   We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and mood in the restaurant! Food we ordered were takowasabi, spicy tuna tartar, $10 starter combo, pressed sushi, almond tofu, okonomiyaki, pork cheek and oden.  All were great though some of the dishes i had better else where. Nome has better oden, i have had better salmon pressed sushi. Pork cheek was ok salt and pepper.  Yuzu hi ball was a refreshing drink!"}
{"text":"I like this location much better than the one downtown. I typically go during busy hours, but even then - surprisingly there isn't much of a wait! If you haven't been to these types of Japanese restaurants, be warned. It gets VERY loud as the workers are constantly shouting (in Japanese) goodbye/thank you etc. It can be overwhelming at times if you're trying to have a proper conversation, but normally it's amusing.   The food is delicious, but it can get pricey especially if you plan on ordering a lot. A must on the menu are the stuffed oysters!! I forget the actual name... But THEY ARE INCREDIBLE. I dream about these. I don't typically like oysters, but I could eat 4 of those things myself. It used to be known as Guu (I don't know why they changed it?!) but it's a cool spot to grab good food and some drinks with friends. Definitely a go-to spot for me in North York."}
{"text":"Kinka izakaya offers an authentic Japanese experience, from the waiters and cooks who yell out orders (just like in Japan), to the taste of the food.  I very often find goodies in they specials menu, which is not available online. Some of the items that I almost always order is the Karaage (fried chicken), great with a big mug of beer! And the takowasabi (octopus with wasabi stems), which is a great appetizer.  I would throw caution to those who choose this place for a date, and it can get loud here and hard to have a conversation. Coming alone after a long day of work for a quick meal is definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Great food with great atmosphere.  Chic and modern! Gotta try all their desserts! Parking isn't too easy but not a big problem. Friendly service and staff is upbeat."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater, so a lot of the menu items were not for me, but the  dishes I did have were all very good. The real star of the bar is the atmosphere. It is very much true to what Japan felt like when I visited. Worth going at least once even if the food menu is off putting to you."}
{"text":"A really awful experience. Extremely disappointed with the inconsistent service.  The first time I came here the service was decent and the food was decent. The second time, the service was horrible and the food was very poorly cooked.  We come in, and there is the usual greeting and we are seated with a firm reminder of their seating time policy. We order four dishes and we ask for cold water. The first dish comes in 10 minutes, it's finished pretty quickly but we ended up waiting maybe 15 minutes for the next dish (takoyaki), that was finished pretty quickly again and we wait even longer for the udon. The udon was very overcooked to the point where the noodles were turning into mush. The dishes were also very very salty. For the grilled mackerel, we end up waiting an additional half an hour and the waitress completely disappears. She only offered us water once this whole time and when we ask her how long it is going to take, she leaves and serves other people and comes back ten minutes later to tell us it will be a few minutes. We ended up eating the salty mackerel plain with nothing else to eat on the side and when we ask for the bill, she disappears again. She never ended up giving us the bill, I had to ask another waitress. Really disappointed with the service, especially for a fairly new place with a supposedly good reputation. We left hungrier than we came in from all the waiting. My mom made another meal at home. It was a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Amazing environment and great service. This place is perfect for groups or celebrations such as birthdays. High energy staff who greet everyone upon arrival! Modern cozy environment with comfortable bench seating. Totally recommend sitting up at the chef type table on a busy night, fun to watch the chefs and hear the orders coming in! Top quality food, great for sharing."}
{"text":"Very unsatisfactory experience. Instead of serving good food, the owner seemed to take a liking to gimmicky, pretentious overpriced bull biomass because thats certainly what my friends and I experienced on our visit to Kinka. They charged nine dollars for 5 paper thin pieces of white tuna tataki, the food took forever to come out, and all the workers shouted things in Japanese so loudly that it allowed me to envision what it must have been like invading Normandy in WW2. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was amazing here, got the 7 course meal deal for $29 each person. All the meals were really well portion. The place is loud, really lively and great atmosphere. It tends to get really busy in the evenings so having reservations is a must. Would definitely come back again to try their other set course meals!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Kinka!  Was in the area last Friday night and decided to walk in and luckily there was one more space for the three of us.  As usual, the place was super busy and loud greetings from the staff as you arrive.  We were seated near the back part of the restaurant this time which I much prefer then the last time when we were near the door as the loudness in the front can be a bit too much.  Love the selection of Izakaya food especially the karage (fried chicken) and grilled gindara (black cod).  The only thing that they are missing here are the yakitori (skewers).  We also got the unagi rice in a stone bowl which was delicious.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We had one dish that didn't come for over half a hour and when I told the server, she made sure we got it right away."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I love their sashimi and beef tataki. They tasted super fresh and delicious. There are great atmosphere and friendly staffs. I would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Loud, fun and cool :) Those are the 3 words that describe this izakaya joint. The service during the week is attentive, the foods are great and the atmosphere is unlike  something you will experience at other similar restaurants in Toronto. Foods here are meant for sharing, and its a great place to bring a date or a group of friends. For beverages stick with beer and sake."}
{"text":"This place was great!!!   Really cool ambience here. Immediately you're greeted in Japanese by all the staff in the restaurant. Be prepared for that loud greeting as it might catch you off guard.   The place has a really nice aesthetic to it, and it's always bustling with activity and conversations. The aromas of the fresh tapas being prepared is awesome.   I decided on kinoko bibimbap and salmon ozisushi. Both dishes were prepared quite promptly yet with care.   The smoky torched flavour from the ozisushi is incredible. It's so delicious I really can't get enough of it.   The kinoko bibimbap was super good too - the mushroom and cheese mixture was perfect and got slightly crisp because of the stone bowl.   I also ordered a strawberry lemonade which came in a nice sized mason jar.   It is a bit more on the expensive side. Expect to get 2-3 dishes per person (since it's tapas it's small plates but 2 dishes should be good). It came to be about $40 after tip (perhaps a bit less) which is not bad for dinner!   In all, Kinka North York is a great spot for some delicious food and good conversation with friends!"}
{"text":"Yum!  We started our love for Kinka when we visited the Montreal location.  Every dish that we ordered blew our minds!  The oyster flavors were incredible, the pressed/torched salmon sushi was a perfectly paired.  The the bibimbap with cheese was also delicious.  The staff were so lovely at wach location and were so welcoming and lovely.  They helped us navigate the menu and made recommendations.  They were so much fun with the sake bombs as well :). We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Baked oysters was tastey, best dish of the night. They did however stuff it with a lot of mushrooms making it look like it was a large oyster. Portions were smaller than other izakayas that ive been to. They only gave 4 pieces of seaweed for the takowasabi, which was not enough.  The spicy negitoro was minced perfectly but lacked flavor. Be sure to not sit at the centre of the bar where the food is served as the chefs are constantly yelling and chanting. I sat infront of the chefs and it was way too loud for my liking, couldn't even have a conversation with my boyfriend without being interrupted. :( I would have preferred eating Nome instead."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya North York was a pleasant surprise. Honestly, I was not expecting a good Izakaya and Japanese tapas restaurant in GTA, but boy was I glad to be wrong.   When you enter, be prepared to be WELCOME very loud by the staff. Love the energy! Comparing to other Izakaya sin North Toronto, this one has the best vibe and the place is huge with high ceiling. This Izakaya offers wide range of drinks, small plates of unique Japanese dishes, sashimi, and ramen. Getting back to the energy from the staff, if you want attention then order Saki Bomb. Be prepared to draw attention. In retrospect, everything we order was fast, delicious, tasty and well prepared. A great lunch experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Really Close to the building I  am living and always go there for dinners. typical Japanese food with light taste and a lot of different choices. Love it"}
{"text":"Loud. Very similar to the bloor street location but bigger.., this one has a nice patio on the balcony..  Food wise: karage was nicely fried chicken.. Good but not outstanding and the pork cheek (pork jowl) was average  Grilled mackerel was soft as butter (Japanese grilled fish is usually very good) and the black sesame crime brule was the highlight! Green tea cheesecake was heavier than most Japanese cheesecakes (I prefer mine light like the one at Le Cafe michi) and was average... Oden was a very good dish... A slight wasabi on the side complemented the white carrot in a very sweet brothy soup... Satisfying!   Good to go in a group.. But it's a loud place like most izakayas in Toronto...If you want quieter , try the patio but on nice days it would be hard to get a seat...They do take reservations..  Parking is pricy! Park at hallmark centre.. Shop $15  at whole foods and get 90 minutes free ... Our stay was longer than 90 minutes so I had to pay an extra $6 upon exit.  Ordering 5 dishes (mackerel, oden, salmon pressed sushi, pork jowl (cheek), karage and 2 drinks and dessert (black sesame crime brule and green tea cheesecake) costed about $96 which included 15 per cent tip.. A bit in the pricy side but worth to go and check it out at least once..."}
{"text":"Guu is a unique restaurant.  I went to this location on a Friday, we parked locally on the street near the restaurant and arrived to be seated for four people at around 9:30. We were told the wait was going to be half an hour to an hour but after walking around for fifteen minutes we were called back to the restaurant.   The overall interior design of the restaurant is very clean and modern. The patio looked really nice but was closed due to rain earlier in the day.  We were seated by the window right across from the bar. The atmosphere was very loud and positive very similar to Kinton Ramen and from what I've heard are owned by the same person.  The food was great and came at a reasonable time, quality was amazing. We ordered a variety of items but my absolute favourite was the Lobster Sashimi. There are also special birthday items that can only be ordered on your birthday. (The whole staff will sing you happy birthday very loudly.)  My only complaint is that the temperature of the restaurant does get a bit hot and was something we all noticed.   When leaving the restaurant I was chased down by a staff member, she gave me a paper that said \"Happy Birthday!\" and inside was a picture of our table of when they sang the birthday song. This was really sweet and a suprise for me so kudos to you guys.  I would recommend coming here if you haven't tried it and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what I came for.  This restaurant is known for being very lively.  I would recommend it if you love place that welcomes you and lots of noise.    If it's your birthday they will sing for you too.  The food is not bad, but for the price you are paying for its only decent.  You will be able to get better quality elsewhere.  Don't get the wrong, it's not bad.  Just not to the price point."}
{"text":"The food is really good! Get all the carpaccio! The drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere is fun. Just very loud but honestly if you're buzzed and down to have a fun time I think its good! The best part is the wait is not ridiculous, Friday night we waited for 15-20 minutes which honestly was not bad at all! I would recommend and come on a birthday for a super loud song or do the sake bomb for a very loud chant!"}
{"text":"FRESH FRESH FRESH!!!! Their sashimi are very fresh, very delicious, very sweet. It is beautifully plated. Will go back no doubt!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great place to go with a group of friends. The restaurant is very lively and loud as they shout greetings in Japanese every time a customer comes in and leaves. It keeps things entertaining, but can be hard to have conversations without yelling across the table. Also, there were 3 birthdays in the hr and half we were dining. They brought out colourful shots, sang the birthday song, and got half the restaurant involved to sing and clap along. Im considering bringing a friend here for their birthday to give them the spotlight next time.  Their plates are smaller, although they do have a few larger dishes but their menu is set towards sharing.   I went on a Saturday night with a friend. We sat at the bar since it was just us two, but if we wanted a table, it would've been a 30-45min wait. We got a pitcher of Sapporo to start, pumpkin croquette, miso saba, cheesy baked oysters, chicken karagge, and seared salmon sushi blocks. The salmon sushi was our favourite - the fish had a smoky flavour, and a velvety texture with just the right amount of tanginess from the ponzu sauce. We tried to order it again but the kitchen had run out of supplies for the dish already.  They have a 2 hr seating limit, which is needed because I could sit there for hours nibbling on their delicious food and sipping on Japanese beer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place, the atmosphere is unique and we love the music they play too. We always try to come through at least once and month (Y)"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre....   Tontoro was the worst, it literally came 5 second after ordering it.... it is so dry and not fresh....  The others are ok, wagyu oshizushi (presses sushi) is ok but imo too much rice.....with so little wagyu (honestly, I am not even sure if it's real wagyu).....  Salmon cream korokke is total disappointment, why is it soak in some sauce?  Not only the food was so so, there's no parking available.  I parked at the underground parking next door, at about 5:40.  Then I exited the parking at about 8pm.... parking charges was 6am-6pm max $6 and 6pm-6am for max of $6.....so guess how much I was charged?  $12 :( there's also no complimentary parking. I totally won't come back again and won't recommend anyone to come here unless you want to pay for expensive parking.....yeah if I have known about this then I would only enter the parking lot at 6:01pm."}
{"text":"I love the service and ambience, and food is alright too.  The lunch specials are heavy on carbs and too light on protein.  Haven't been at night yet, but I did order a saké at lunch and it was fantastic and well-priced considering the competition.  I would go back at every opportunity."}
{"text":"Another Guu-like experience with Japanese Tapas.  Booking at 3 person reservation still meant sitting at the bar, but like many reviews noted, this is not a bad thing because 1) you get to see the food prepared and 2) purse hooks and 3) amazing lighting for food pics.   What we ordered:  Bamboo - cocktail off the main menu with melon liqueur and 1.5 oz alcohol. Delicious and light, but not much in terms of booze. Chicken Karaage - fried chicken is always a keeper - juicy inside, crispy outside Beef udon - we needed some carbs too - was ok, but not the highlight Salmon and 7 friends - beautifully displayed, server mixes up the dish and eat with seaweed. Delicious and salmon was so fresh. Black cod sushi - beautifully served, and yummy. Love the big portions Grilled black cod - this came last and was sizzling off the plate. Sweet and delicate, HIGHLIGHT! Scallop sashimi - off the daily menu. Super duper fresh, came with wasabi and soy sauce. Baked brie - crispy and melty brie. Was a lot less interesting after it cooled down, though...so eat quickly.  Food, as always, was amazing. I'm just not a fan of the noise level - it was migraine level at some point and couldn't have a conversation with my friends. One of us was always shouting: \"...wait, WHAT??\"  But will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is not a sushi place! Their sushi items are VERY limited and they also serve fast food items disguised as fancy/overpriced food (ie: chicken nuggets and fries!) The majority of the items have unfamiliar names and nobody bothered to help us out picking a foreign dish. I honestly did not really feel welcome here.  This is a SUPER LOUD Place. (did I type that in caps?) You are greeted with all the staff yelling something very incomprehensible together when you open the door. You have to take off your shoes for some weird reason. If you don't have reservations, you'll be placed at the far back, where the tables are placed so close to one another, you have to watch out for your neighbour's elbow not to hit you when you eat.    The menu has no pictures and for someone who's not familiar with the items it can take forever to figure out what to order. The waiter brought the wrong food to our table, thinking the guys next to us are in our group!  I'll give them 2 stars for the good Salmon Sushi. I just got hyped up to try this place because of the fancy exterior and thinking it's a sushi place. Now I know the real deal with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out the new uptown Guu, and happy to say it was a success!  More than a year after my last visit to their Church St. location, I was happy to thee that the North York menu was the same! We got to try all of our old favourites, and all were fresh, delicious, and plated wonderfully :)  My favourites: Kinoko (cheese and mushroom) bibimbap, Gindara (black miso cod), Ebimayo(fried shrimp doused in spicy mayo...drool), Takoyaki (octopus balls) & Okonomiyaki (japenese pancake).  The only item that fell a bit short was the seared tuna....the fish was a bit too cooked and the toppings a bit band.. but still edible.   3 happy full people, 8 dishes, 3 drinks (lychee mojito! yum!) and 1 dessert later (delicious green tea cheesecake) the total per person came to $43 including taxes and tips.  Set-up is nice, and staff is super friendly, and just as loud and vibrant as the Church location.  Will be back!  Perk: We live close by so we called for them to hold a table for us - they texted us when it was ready with 15 to claim the table which was great since we are only a ten minute walk away. Nice to not have to wait outside for an hour!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food. The sake are really good. Waiters and waitress are all Japanese and are very kind! Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I went back a few times since my last review and my experience has been much better. Friendly staff, and being sat with a smile and without too much fuss, or seating us in horrible sections when the restaurant is empty.   Food is consistently delicious. I would say my least favorite thing is the fried okra as it is just a bit too greasy with not so much flavor. I've had almost everything on their menu and everything is good to excellent and will be coming back regularly. Torched sushi is delicious as is the eel bowl."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Coming here on a Saturday night around 11 pm and I was expected Guu Izakaya would be packed and the restaurant was half full. We have a choice to be seat at the bar, back area, communal tables or at the patio.   I had been to the other Guu locations and I knew what to expect: loud and cheerful service. So I was not bothered by the loud greeting and lively vibe. My only concern though is the lighting. The interior just too bright with spotlight light set up everywhere. I could barely open my eyes after a few drinks with such bright intense lighting. Please dim the light or I would be wearing sunglasses next time.  Menu is similar to Guu's Church Location. The food is Japanese pub fares with a lot of deep fried items so good to enjoy with a Mega mug of Sapporo.   We ordered off the Daily Special menu which has more interesting items:  Pan Fried Pig Intestine BBQ Salted Beef Short Ribs Tako Sashimi  Nothing really wowed me but something good to snack on for late night!  I do love the Sake Mojito with GUUD! Ramune!  Will I be back? For sure especially if it is not busy and I can drop by whenever. And hopefully they would dim the light for late night Izakaya experience. Why would an Izakaya has such bright lighting? The only good thing maybe for food photo taking? At least all my photos looked great!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and great atmosphere!  We had the Kinkalicious and everything was delicious.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Kinka looks a little confusing to enter, it's this large wooden door in the middle of a black building with little signs. Upon entering you are greeted with a blast of noise from both the crowd and the waiters screaming at you. It's always funny to watch customers enter and feel awkward cause they are the middle of the attention lol. It's really hard to hear in there so a conversation is gonna be difficult.   There's a variety of Japanese small dishes/tapas and they range from $5-$15. They're pretty small dishes so the bill can rack up pretty quick if you're in a large group. They don't split bills but they allow you to pay your own amount on the credit card machine/ cash, but you have to do your own math.. I wish they'd just spilt it. If you like Sake they have a tons of variety of it and they also have calpis!  I really enjoy most of their dishes, the unagi don with cheese is my favourite!! Such a good mix. Other dishes include karaage, salmon / hamachi slices, ribs, baked oysters.. So many... But I can assure you taste wise it won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Worst service at Guu I had ever. And I've tried several Vancouver and both previous Toronto locations many times. Food is not as good as the previous locations and apparently the kitchen doesn't know how to produce them on time. Waited 15 min for a pitcher of beer, 25 min for the first dish, and 1.5 hr for a grilled mackerel that never came. And they tell me there's a 2 hour seating limit??!! The waitress keeps on delaying every time asked about few of our dishes. All the kitchen did was keep on shouting. Perhaps the kitchen should focus on making the food and waiters on filling waters for customers first before caring about all the shouting?! It was a ridiculous experience at this new Guu location. Think twice before coming here instead of their old locations. The patio can't make up for the disorganized service and kitchen. I'd doubt I'd be back here."}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place and just could not wait to check it out. The food was great - the ambience was amazing! We tried at least 8 different items. We actually started with the sake bomb and in the excitement my boyfriend hit the plate under the drink and it shattered on the ground, with the drink spilling everywhere - so sadly he missed out on his sake bomb drink (which we ended up paying for). The service was quick too but we also felt rushed to eat and leave. We understand its a small place on a Friday night but we were celebrating our anniversary and felt a bit flustered. Other than the quick push out the door and having to pay for a drink we did not end up consuming, it was a great experience. We would probably go back one day with a group of friends, maybe earlier in the week so that we can actually take time to enjoy our meals and chat. In terms of anniversary dinner's - not the best option."}
{"text":"Nice patio, great interior design, well decorated bar... I loved the atmosphere!   I went for lunch with my friend. Ordered Teishoku set. It was good and decent. Nothing wow about though.  Service was inconsistent and staffs were not energetic as other locations. They didn't really yell although they are known for the izakaya chant.   Also volume of meal didn't match with the price. It was pretty expensive lunch and have to walk out with half-empty-tummy :("}
{"text":"This place used to be Guu Izakaya. Still the similar menu and vibe, it reminds me of real Japanese izakaya in Japan greet by great enthusiastic staffs.  Service is friendly and polite, food presentation and quality is overall good..but a bit too rich with mayo and cheese taste on some dishes."}
{"text":"Good place for snacks but the servings are somewhat small for a full meal. I really wanted to like this place and I would definitely come back but probably just for drinks and snacks/ dessert. The almond tofu was yummy!"}
{"text":"worst birthday experience ever. It's for my friend's birthday and also father's day for my friend's' husband which also left a comment on the reservation. We came in with a birthday cake and also advised the host that it's for my friend's birthday. After we finished the dinner, i asked the waitress to bring the cake, instead, the waitress brought the bill. That's fine if it's a matter of communication, then i asked again to bring the cake, and the dear waitress asked if we want to have the cake in the restaurant. Wow, how awkward to be asked this question. Again,i said yes, we are going to have the birthday cake in the restaurant, the waitress the. brought the plates and forks. However, when she brought the cake, three of us were all shocked,because the lady brought the cake without even unwrapping it or put it on a plate,not even lighted the candle. So there was not any birthday song sang by the house, and in the end, when we were about having the cake, guess what, there was not even a knife provided. This is the worst birthday experience any of us had in Canada. Highly recommend not to go this place for any occasion any more. Very disappointed at the service, especially to this ignorant waitress."}
{"text":"Bring your earmuffs or headphones!  Noise level is high but food is good and very expensive.  We spent $250 for group of 6. Dishes are all appetizer size servings and not filling.  The server was telling us all the specials for the day and cannot understand a word of what she said.  Stupid!  It sucks if the food came in only 5 pieces per tiny plate. My hubby and I had to split a meatball and a capelin. If I ever get invited to eat here again,  I have to pass it!  There are better restaurants out there to spent this much money.  P.s.  Don't bring your babies or kids in this restaurant.  I feel sorry for those families."}
{"text":"As of November 1st, 2015, the franchise agreement between Kinka Family Inc. and Kitanoya Marketing Corp ended which resulted in the Toronto Guu Izakaya locations being renamed to Kinka Izakaya. Formly known as Guu Izakaya, Kinka has been one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Last summer the they opened their third location in North York which makes all the uptown kids much happier.  Kinka North York is probably my favourite Kinka to visit, large floor to ceiling windows (which open out to the patio) gives the restaurant a nice airy atmosphere perfect for summer and winter alike.  Salmon Oshizushi (blowtorched Atlantic salmon pressed sushi) &amp; The daily special of Deep Fried Okra. The Salmon Oshizushi is one of my favourite dishes to order at Kink North York (I think it's exclusive only to this location). The smokiness from the blowtorch &amp; the ginger and green onion garnish gives a nice contrast to the fatty salmon and soft lightly sweet rice. It was my first time ordering the deep fried okra with matcha salt and I thought it was a bust, the batter was too thick and not crispy. I also couldn't get the right ratio of matcha salt to okra, it would either be too bland or way too salty.  The Kinka Scotch Egg was also another daily special which I thought was fantastic, the sweet creamy sauce complimented the scotch egg perfectly. Other favourites that are must tries are Scallop Sashimi Salmon Oshizushi and Takoyaki.   I love the Takowasabi (marinated octopus with wasabi stem) from Kinka. There's plenty of other favourites, I highly recommend visiting with a party of 3 - 4 people so you can order a variety of different dishes without having too much of one item.  The name \"KINKA\" means \"Golden Flower\" which symbolizes \"Happiness\" in Japanese. At KINKA IZAKAYA our mission is to serve each and everyone of our guests \"happiness\" with both our mouth-watering dishes and our highest quality service. This is why our friendly and energetic staff is an integral part of what makes KINKA IZAKAYA extraordinary and a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"I don't usually like tapas style restaurant where you have to share your dishes, but this is an exception. If you are craving good variety of Japanese food, this is your best bet. The place is very clean, both inside and patio option, staffs are super friendly. Few negatives is that the restaurant gets really really noisy during dinner time. The chefs are constantly yelling, so I get super startled. So I always take patio option. Rest assured, lunch time is way more quiet."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, a bit westernized.  Interior is quite nice but the ambiance is ok.  Too noisy because all the waiters scream orders and greet people in Japanese.  I found I was envious of the people sitting outside because it seemed more peaceful."}
{"text":"I attended the dinner service here at roughly around 8:40 PM. The place overall has a good interior and has a modern design, so that will attract anyone that focuses on the atmosphere when visiting resturants. However, the food was not Japanese food, not professional and the quality was similar to instant meal that you get from grocery stores. I do not recommend this place, but would only go for the design."}
{"text":"I've always liked dining at Guu due to the experience and food. I had heard that Guu was opening in North York (close to home) and was excited that I would not need to go downtown anymore. Was I wrong. Perhaps it is the fact that they just opened last weekend but they really need to work on the service and the food.   Service was extremely slow. Perhaps the kitchen and the staff are still new but I expected our experience to be top notch like the other Guu locations. When Guu is such a well established chain restaurant in Toronto I would expect all it's locations to have the same speed of service. Our table had originally ordered 11 dishes to share but our dishes came very staggered and the kitchen seemed to have forgotten our order. We ordered edamame and it took an hr to come out. On top of that, the edamame was over boiled. How hard can it be to cook edamame? If they can't even get something as simple as edamame right there's a problem here. Moreover, we had ordered a bibimbap and the table behind us got it first even though my party had sat down first. Lastly, the presentation of the food is also lacking. Some of the dishes were presently poorly and looked unappetizing.    Overall, a disappointing experience. I expected more from Guu. Will try again in maybe half a year to see if this location's food and service has improved."}
{"text":"I wish i could give a half star to add to this but alas Yelp! Came here with some colleagues for dinner. We ordered basically half their menu, and the food was generally quite enjoyable. However, noise levels in this place are unnerving to the point of unbearable, because the four of us had to scream at each other to hear what the other was saying, even though we were quite literally squished together! We wanted to just finish our food and get out because we couldn't converse over dinner and drinks at all.."}
{"text":"It is just like other chain stores of its brand in elsewhere in Toronto. The servers are very warm-hearted and the hospitality is great! It's an Izakaya so the dishes here are mostly small, side-dishes size, which is good for those who wanna try more than one dishes. It's good for small group but it's very hard to chat with friends here because the staffs shout every single time when customers come in and out. I could hardly hear what I was saying to my friend or what she responded."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the new North York location on Sunday Jun 7th. The decor and patio look awesome as it is located under the new condominium. However, the kitchen runs super slow considering that was not busy by the time we visited the restaurant. It took 19 minutes or so to have the first appetizer. We wait a over an hour and half to get what we order which include two appetizers and two main dishes. The server was nice and explained that kitchen is running very slow. If you like the idea of Japanese tapas you may like the food but it does not worth the wait and the money you pay. We live very close to this place but it was our first and last time to go there."}
