{"text":"Have been going this place for years. The last time wasn't great but tonight we ordered the family pack (3 pieces of fish and 2 fries). It was the most disgusting fish and chip I have ever had. The paper thin halibut was covered in a triple coat of batter. The frys were ok. After this meal, we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Disapponting.   I love fish and chips and gone here once before and it was ok.  It's close to where we live so picked up a family dinner of Halibut and chips.  The halibut was the thinnest cut of fish and all batter, it looked like it had been sliced in half.  Called back to tell them but they wouldn't do anything and said that's the way it is.  I know what a piece halibut is supposed to look like.  Next time I'll drive the extra distance and go up to Arora to a place  I know is always good!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Crispy batter, crispy fries, large serving.  It's better to eat-in to keep everything tasting fresh.  I've eaten here many times; it's always good. :)"}
{"text":"Whooaaa..   Sorry for 2 star but it was disappointing experience for me.  I was in the area so desided to try fish and chips.  It looked like newly opened but the atmosphere was very strange. No music and so quiet.  And server could not speak english very well so there was some difficulies asking some questions because i am not good at english too:(  Anyways I expected good taste of fried food but it was horrible taste ever.  Fish taste soggy and not fresh.  I order calamari as well .  It was the worst calamari ever.  The squid was too small and batter was soggy and squid taste strange salty.  Service was okay but she was busy doing something in the kitchen.  Anyways it was not happy experience for me. I hope they are doing better job on food taste."}
{"text":"Not sure why such a low rating...  I've been here quite a few times and, really, come on, it's fish and chips... What are you expecting?  Its straightforward. My personal favourite item is Halibut on a Bun. Why? It's what McDonald's tries to do as a fish sandwich bit fails at. Battered Halibut with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce... Damn, so good.  4 stars only because, I agree the place looks outdated, but most fish and chips shops look divey, so big deal."}
{"text":"Fish and chips is one of my go to comfort foods. Usually I try to eat in because deep fried food usually don't stay crispy wrapped up in a bag. However, I did order take out this time. I ordered one of their lunch specials, haddock and chips with coleslaw and a can of pop for $8.95. Large portion size so good value. Surprisingly, the fish stayed crispy when I got home. The fish was moist and batter light and crunchy.  The fries didn't fair so well.  They were soggy but as expected with any take out fries.  I can imagine they would be better eaten in.  A mom and pop operation which I like supporting. I would come back again when I get a craving for good traditional fish and chips."}
{"text":"2 stars = Meh. I've experienced better... at IKEA!!  I am a big fan of fish and chips. Too bad many places just don't know how to make it. So whenever I see a place with \"Fish & Chips\" in their name I have to try it out.  I will start off by saying the restaurant is spacey and it's decor is old-fashioned. Restaurant and washrooms are kept clean. Service is quick. No WiFi though.  Now to the food. I ordered halibut and chips. Portions are good but the halibut was greasy (and not in a good way). Fries were A-OK. I was expecting more from a fish & chips restaurant."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and decent sized portion of both fish and chips. Batter crispy and not excessive.  The one time a piece of fish served was smaller than usual, they happily replaced it."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant after my fave fish and chip place in Richmond Hill closed it's doors. I've tried the Allencourt for Fish and Chips but this place is better.  This restaurant is located in a plaza that is located just north of Elgin Mills, on Yonge St. The plaza contains a Loblaws and this restaurant is a few doors down from Coras.  Anyways, the restaurant itself could use some updating, but from observing their clientele, most come in and order takeout. The counter is usually fairly busy, which is a good sign for a fish and chip place. The restaurant is clean and staff are friendly.  I can't comment on their menu items, as I have only had their Halibut and Chips, lightly battered. This is why I come here....the portion size is good and the fish is flavourful and moist. Chips are homemade and there's plenty of them. Coleslaw is typical fare.  I've dined here probably 4 or 5 times now...never had a bad meal and continue to come back when in Richmond Hill"}
{"text":"Pretty awful effort here. Too bad it's he only option in the area for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Tumble in here for fish and chip just before an event, spacious, clean. Many varieties of fish, had a halibut fish and chip. The wait is short, the outer skin is so crispy and fish inside was still moist and tender. I'll definitely come back again for more later."}
