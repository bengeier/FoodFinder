{"text":"The set up to this place is a complete mess. I still have no clue how it works, I ordered my drinks and pizza in two different places. Even the employees weren't sure. I was a little frustrating and immediately put the blame on hipsters and their stupid rules. Parking can also be a mess.  With that said  once you get over the set up the food is amazing. Highly recommend the corn pizza....soooo good. We even made room for dessert with some red velvet cake which was incredible too. This place really has everything good food, a bakery and even a good sized wine selection."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is amazing. We used to go at least once a month, but have started to scale back a bit because it is just too busy on the weekends. There is often no place to sit, a long line to order and parking is really difficult. It is a tough balance between a hip metro cafe and being inconvenient. If they could expand the space inside a bit and solve the parking issues, we would be regulars for sure.  All-in-all, the place is a Saturday morning treat."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before. Just looked up Yelp & felt like giving it a try. Was really satisfied with the experience. Lots of variety & authentic touch in the food. Ambience is lively.  Waiting to go there & enjoy again."}
{"text":"Probably if I had ordered something else, La Grande Orange Pizzeria would have scored 4 stars. And it all depends on what you are used to growing up. I ordered the tuna salad sandwich, and they put sweet pickle relish in the tuna salad. Bleah bleah bleah bleah bleah. Patooie patooie also. My friend got a breakfast sandwich thingy on a special English muffin, and loved it. La Grande Orange Pizzeria serves the breakfast stuff all day. Very good to know.   Parking her is a bear. As in there are about 20 spaces, tops. Plus a few behind the restaurant. If you go, carpool."}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza!! Absolutely loved the avacado pizza. So delicious. The wait staff was great, very friendly and invited us to a wine tasting while we waited.  Parking is limited, but certainly not an issue to complain about."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town. Try their cheese pizza with mushrooms, onions, goat cheese and prosciutto! Your Welcome!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love!!! We had the fallen angel pizza -- a great punch of nuanced flavor. The best pizza we have had in a while!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phx. Parking can be frustrating, so the weekends you should consider valet.   All the salads are solid and for pizza, I'd recommend the Avocado Pizza. It is a spin on the standard margherita adding a splash of a freshly squeezed lemon and then topped off with a fresh sliced avocado. For the record, LGO buys the best avocados I've tasted.   Another tip buy your bottle of wine in the attached grocery side of LGO for no cork fee and prices aren't bad for bottled wine.   Great casual upscale dining atmosphere. Jeans, t-shirt, and great food."}
{"text":"My son went for lunch yesterday and became sick by dinner time...he said the food was great, though, so that's too bad."}
{"text":"i just made an account on yelp so i could write a review for this place.   i was visiting from California and my friend was like.. \"i have to take you to this place! you will love it!\"   he was so right.   we got there about 5 minutes before closing time on a saturday night. they were super cool about it though.  didn't rush us at all.  i had a pizza called \"the gladiator.\"  AMAZING.  we also ordered a kids meal for an appetizer.  it was peanut butter and jelly \"sushi.\"  really cute!  came with french fries, carrots and celery.   the waitress was really nice and helpful.  good about refilling our drinks.   when we were done another waiter came over and chatted with us and got us a to-go box and then continued to tell us the best way to reheat the pizza the next day. he also got us new drinks in to-go cups.. .which is awesome :-)   i highly recommend this place.  everything we ate was REALLY great.   also bought a chocolate cupcake from the bakery.  outstanding.   i will definitely go there again when I'm back in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Oooooh, I liked it, very much so!  Just sad that I didn't get to try more of its myriad offerings, especially the pizza.  We enjoyed a lovely brunch here on a Friday.  Cute little place, lots of ambiance, good people watching (quite the hopping place on this midsummer day), tasty food.  We had a round of Bloody Marys, and those were nicely done, as well.  A great spot to just hang and nosh and chitchat with friends."}
{"text":"The roasted corn pizza is my favorite and for dessert,  the sea salt cookie is a must."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by several people and excited to try. Upon showing up the Menu looked great however our server Moriah was terrible. We ordered a few pizzas and a salad, food was excellent. Our server couldn't get it together, not once did she come back to fill the water glasses, bring replacement silverware or for that matter even take the order. We caught her outside chatting with her chronies and washing windows behind the teapot while we were her only table. She wasfast with the check lol. 5 star food 1 star service"}
{"text":"I went here once and I cannot stop dreaming about the roasted corn pizza! The goat cheese on it was perfect and the roasted sweet corn added a nice pop to every bite! I also ordered the Pizzeria Chopped Salad which was just okay, it was bland, but the pizza more than made up for it.  The service was also wonderful. While waiting for a table I was able to attend a wine tasting and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Second year in a row and we made sure to stop in. Love this place way to much to skip town without eating here."}
{"text":"I love this place- both the store and the pizzeria!  The food is absolutely amazing...my favorite is the grilled artichoke appetizer.  For being in such a cool neighborhood, and for having such great food, the prices are really reasonable as well!  My favorite example being the fact that you can get a 60 oz re-usable jug of beer for just 10 bucks...and if you bring it back, they refill it for you for only 10 bucks as well.    The staff is super friendly and personable and can remember faces even if you've only been here a few times.  Once, we were there on a Friday night when it was particularly busy.  We had to wait for about 35 minutes for food- which is longer than average (but still not bad)...so the waiter gave us our appetizers and dessert on the house!  We hadn't even complained!"}
{"text":"Hot Sammy Boy sandwich. Tasty but tiny. Needs some kale or spinach. Would recommend the chicken sandwich instead. Food was not plentiful."}
{"text":"thought i would throw a shot out to all the staff at lgo!!  especially margaret!!  the  mornings i come in, i always leave felling better about my day.  and when i come for lunch and dinner its equally as fabulious!!"}
{"text":"I love LGO, period. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars? Service. Every time I have gone here, the service has left me wanting more. Now before you read this and say, \"this guy must really want attention or he's a picky b***ard\" that is not the case.  It would be nice to see the waitress every so often.  Now. The pizza here is truly delectable, there's no denying that; try any of them, they're all slices of heaven.  The beer choices and even the lemonade really fills your void (if you have one).  I would recommend it and even go next door for the gelato."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  Everything I have tried is delicious.  I always order at least two full meals.  Amazing Pizza, amazing burgers and fries, and all of the sauces are from scratch.  I would live here if I could."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the world!  We're from out-of-town and happened upon this treasure by accident.   Thin crust pizza to die for!"}
{"text":"Overall great experience here. Only complaint: the gluten free crust is not vegan!!! (They put milk in it???)  Got the gluten free crust anyway, and it was just okay. It was very flat and brittle. However, the vegan pesto and veggie pizza options were pretty good.   The meat eaters in our group really enjoyed their pizzas. The menu has good variety and the service was quick.   Would recommend! (Unless you want gluten free and vegan)"}
{"text":"Delectable!  In every way, the food AND the staff are incredible. First, everyone always a remembers my name, my preferences and offers great ideas for new things to try!  Exceptional friendly and professional service always makes me feel welcomed and comfortable. That is only half of it!   I love eating here because with a gluten allergy they have the BEST gluten free crust and pizza I have had the honor experienced!  The crust is a crisp thin delight that highlights the flavors of your chosen toppings. I highly suggest trying everything they offer, it is all delicious. I do, however, consistently add sausage as an add on to the topping because I have a weakness for it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Awesome avocado and prosciutto pizza, baked wings (not fried), and sangria!"}
{"text":"La Grande. Hmmm. You know the food is good - there wouldn't be lines out the door everyday if it wasn't.  However, no matter how good your food is, or how popular your restaurant is, customer service is still important.   I arrived here for a small lunch with some co-workers around 12:00 on a weekday - this is where I made my first mistake. The line extended out the door and there was zero parking. There was a mess of people everywhere. The line was a mess, no one knew how to order or where.   When we finally get to the front of the line there is a huge display case of tammy coe cakes, it was tempting to check them out, but we couldn't because some guy behind the counter was screaming at us to order. Seriously, and when I didn't answer immediatly I got a dirty look! Sad for them though, I probably would have ordered more had I not been rushed.   I ordered my turkey sandwich and started to search for a place to sit. We eventually found a seat in the pizza area. Then had to go back out to wait for our names to be screamed out to get our food. So classy.  My sandwich was good: the bread was good, the turkey was good, but not worth the wait and the grumpy staff."}
{"text":"Usually I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to service. I generally perceive that the service was OK when my friends think it was awful. I would even say I prefer service on the slower side. But LGO crosses the line from \"yea, this is pretty slow but let's just chill and enjoy ourselves\" to \"Where the f*** is my beer?\" and later \"where the f*** is the check.\"  The folks at LGO all know they work at a hot little spot that people will come to because the product is good. Every time I go, they've been rude and genuinely disinterested in serving me (I've been to the grocery twice, and the pizzeria once).   Pizza was very good, but next time I'll stick with Pizza Heaven where they treat me like a customer. You know, someone who gives you money for the goods and services you provide. Or Pizza a Metro, which has better pizza."}
{"text":"The service and food here is awesome! Parking is hard during peak hours of the day but the restaurant is worth it. Great for coffee, breakfast, lunch although I've never eaten dinner here I have heard it's just as good. Definitely a \"must\" go-to place in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh LGO, how I love you. You are the perfect place to go on a date, with a friend, with my family, with a group, by myself, with work associates, etc.   There is a bit of a wait if you go during peak times; however it is worth it.   The caprice salad, when they have it, is INCREDIBLE. Do not pass that up if your server mentions it. On a budget? Pick up a bottle in the store (prices do start around $9.99) and they'll open it for you to enjoy at dinner (or before dinner if you are waiting.)  The pizzas may sound kind of funky if you are new to the joint, but don't fear. They know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times now and have been a little lukewarm about it considering all the hype. Today though, they completely let me down. Ordered a pair of what are essentially $9 Egg McMuffins, and after waiting 10 minutes, they came out tepid to cold. The English muffin wasn't toasted, the eggs were cool, cheese was downright cold, and the bacon was barely warm. I returned my pair of sandwiches, specifically stating that they were cold and I would like them heated. They brought out two freshly prepared sandwiches, no questions asked (hence the 2 stars for good customer service) but they were just as bad as the first time. McDonald's manages a warm sandwich at a third of the cost, so I don't think it's much too expect. Anyways, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've ordered here for the 2nd time today. I'm impressed with the taste of this gluten free pizza . I try to eat as healthy as possible but so writes I cannot - if you like to eat bad foods, but in a good way go here. This place has a friend staff, affordable food and its healthy. I'd come back a third or fourth time for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food, but I think there are much better places right nearby. It has a nice ambiance, but the food was not anything special. I would definitely return, but I would not go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"There is nothing like riding your cruiser to La Grande Orange on a Sat or Sun. This is a great place to listen to the music and people watch, while enjoying a nice breakfast, salad, sandwich, pizza, coffee or glass of sangria. It's usually busy, but fairly laid-back. Grab today's paper, bring your laptop and enjoy the ambiance. The big draw-back is the parking."}
{"text":"Love this place! My 2nd favorite pizza in AZ behind Spinatos. And it's close. Sour Dough crust wood fired pizza, hard to beat. Everything they have great and they have a big variety.   If I lived in that neighborhood I'd live at LGO!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with even better wings. Try the 3 dip app as well. The pimento is also amazing. The staff is awesome and would definitely come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites spots in Arcadia to have a drink or gelato. It's super vegan friendly and allows me to pick more than just a salad. Love the shop, it always has new things. I've been going for months but just lately the girls on the counter hasn't been to friendly or helpful. The service is okay."}
{"text":"Food is consistent and delicious and not pretentious like some of the patrons that frequent here. Cool and hip place that helped revitalize the neighborhood to what it is today.    You can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich.  Although the size of the sandwich is smaller than it used to be, it still packs and tasty punch (and has fewer calories ladies .)    So hop onto your beach cruiser with the overcompensating monster truck tires and head on over to La Gránde Orange or is it pronounced La Grande Oranche, who knows?  One observation, managers there seem to be so unhappy.  Always wearing a long faces."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizzeria of all time.  We have been coming here since 2007, but I'm just now getting around to reviewing it as I'm eating a leftover slice of roasted corn pizza at my desk right now.  Everything is delicious, but the roasted corn & rocket man are my truest loves.  The roasted corn is perfectly balanced & would be the pizza I would choose as my last meal if it had to be pizza.  The sweetness of the corn, the creamy-yet-tangy zing of the goat cheese, the acidic & juicy splash of the tomatoes, the herbaceous freshness from the basil....simply perfection.    And the rocket man kicks a$$, too!  Who knew broccoli was so good on pizza?  And the sun-dried tomatoes on that pizza are like tiny red flavor bombs.  The sourdough crust serves as the perfect vessel for all their pies, with a perfect chewiness & flavor profile of its own.  Also, as others have mentioned, do not skip the pimento cheese (just get the chip/dip platter).  It is incredible.  Also also, their wings.  So damn good.  Not at all buffalo style, but made with a slightly sweet yet spicy flavor.  They are grilled (or baked in the blistering pizza oven) so that there is a slight char to them that is out of this world."}
{"text":"I went there once on the weekend for lunch.  They wait wasn't long but this place was busy.  I don't live near the restaurant and don't go this area of town very often, but it was great to be able to check this place out.  The pizza was very good and I enjoyed walking around the connecting store afterwards."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Phoenix! After moving here, I was on a search for good pizza. Having lived in New York City for many years, I was used to high pizza standards. This definitely was a clear winner. I also love walking around La Grande Orange grocery while waiting for a table to see what fun new stuff they got in!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza and atmosphere. Service is great and the grocery is such fun! Make sure to get their sea salt cookies."}
{"text":"It took me seven years to finally get to this place after gaving heard good things over the years..and i wasnt disappointed. We went on a saturday night and as expected the place was crowded and lively. It has a casual but classy vibe. We had a 25 minutes wait which flew by quickly by checking out the grocery store connected to the restaurant. The cool knick knacks and gelato tasting took care of time. We ordered the Margharita, Fallen Angel and Rocket Man. The crust and the toppings are both fresh. We also ordered the soda, shrimp ceviche and french fries ...all delights on a warm summer evening. And finally gelatos to wrap up a fun evening. My friend also took a chocolate cupcake to go and sent a text raving about it after....Parking situation is tricky but luck gods shined for us last evening. I will certainly recommend this place to bring friends or guests to so they can see a different side of Phoenix...."}
{"text":"I gave LGO a 5 star despite a few of the customers having 'attitude' AKA that 'I'm (wanna be) rich and I'm better than you' but that's NOT the eatery's fault.  The chocolate puddings are def good along with their black tea. The service could've been better for reasons other posters noted.   The above stated: I'll go there again."}
{"text":"Usually come here for breakfast and it is awesome. You have to order at the counter and find your own seat, but the food is excellent. One of my favorite places for an early meal on the weekend."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to LGO. I took an out of town family member today and was completely disappointed. No pizza or burgers until 4 is a disappointment. So we ordered some salads. Well, if I would've known I was paying $9 for a prepackaged salad, that had under-cooked boiled eggs,  I wouldn't have made the drive from Gilbert for that! Sad to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 4 times & I have enjoyed every experience. I have been a patron when I was vegetarian and while currently vegan. I look for vegetarian/vegan options and ability for the restaurant to be accommodating if it isn't immediately obvious on their menu, but, it is obvious that this restaurant is accommodating in being veg-friendly, so it was not an issue.  I've had pizzas and salad during my visits. Both were delicious. I was really happy to see they are also providing gluten-free options too. It was hard not to eat the meal in its entirety, even though I was probably full half-way through, every time. Menu items, particularly the pizzas are easy to customize, if desired. The mozzarella is delicious, the red sauce is not too sweet or tangy. Overall, just a good balance of flavors going on with all their pizzas.   The service was great too. Every time, the servers were nice, friendly, and helpful, especially when I voiced my dietary requirements.   The little grocery and espresso bar are great too! The coffee is actually good and the artisan goods in the grocery are fun and tasty, with some good food novelties as well.  Overall ,this place is charming, not too pricey, casual, but nice atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone, meat-eaters alike."}
{"text":"Top notch food and kind wait staff.  Loved everything we got.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We live around the corner from this lovely little establishment. Best pizza in Phoenix. Most unique for sure. Our favorite is to get half rocket man and half roasted corn with chicken on the whole thing. The pimento cheese dip is surprisingly to die for. The commuter sandwich is the best breakfast option."}
{"text":"Another ridiculous Friday nite wait at LGO for Curbside. Couldn't even park. And, the order was incomplete. They gave me a $50 gift card. But that only means I have to go back to use it. Is it worth it?"}
{"text":"The sourdough crust is Amazing!  I used to work there, so I've tried pretty much everything and it is all scrumptious.  I especially love the gladiator and roasted corn pizzas and I actually ate a whole pizza on my way home in the car once.  I know, I'm disgusting."}
{"text":"Awesome food, the commuter breakfast sandwich is incredibly tasty.. I gave them 4 stars because it's too pricey.. Quick breakfast and coffee will run about 12$"}
{"text":"Great pizza and gelato! Fresh and hot and nice casual atmosphere.  Very reasonable.  Had the mushroom party and gladiator for family of four.  Perfect with coconut gelato and pb&j pie at the end."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars for the food but only giving it 3 stars because I can never find parking!!!!!  I love the whole corner, it's so cute and cozy and European.  The shop in the restaurant is also awesome!  I'm always picking up fancy pasta or a neat book.  I enjoy getting gelato and a cute card afterwards.  As far as the food, the ice tea is the best in the city!  The pizza's are awesome and the cheeseburgers are big and juicy enough to share.  The coconut cupcakes could be a daily staple in my life.  If only they had more parking!"}
{"text":"Parking can be a pain,  but the food is worth it ! The wings and sourdough pizza crust are to die for!! I also like that they have dairy alternatives"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are great; I've modified a couple of them to be vegetarian, and they're still delicious.  The salads are good too.  I think it's a little overpriced, but the food is really, really good."}
{"text":"Hard to beat this upbeat cool place to eat and drink coffee. Quick and easy and they even allow your dogs on the patio. Everything is good from breakfast to dinner and everything in-between. Check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite pizza place! The crust was so light and airy. I have never had anything like it. We had the pepperoni and sausage pizza. Yum! I am looking forward to my next trip over there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here. It's made of sourdough thin crust and it's so delicious! We came here as a recommendation of a friend and have become regulars. The ingredients are so fresh and when they bring it out to you, that first bite is just glorious. I would highly recommend this place for all you pizza lovers out there."}
{"text":"LGO is my favorite pizza of all time.  I've had many-a-good-pizza in my day, and been to some places that I thought were my favorites, until I had this little joint 7 years ago when they first opened.  His first year, the owner did $1M in food cost, because he really cares about the ingredients and the items they use.  It's all extremely high quality products.  They buy and import huge $500 wheels of Reggiano Parmesan cheese that the servers will put on some of your pizza if you so wish.  Everything about this really modern place screams quality.  The Gladiator is my favorite, which is Pepperoni and Sausage, and consists of this locally made Sausage called \"Schreiners Sausage.\"  Some of the best Ive ever had.  Fennel gives it a great little kick, and is extremely cravable.    The Shrimp Ceviche is absolutely amazing.  Flavorful, and tasty and I don't even like avocado, but for some reason this I can eat.  Then, when finished you've GOT to go next door to the Market, and get a few \"Ooey Gooey\" Cupcakes made by a talented woman named Tammie Coe who does excellent cakes and other droolable sweet baked goods.  This is in my opinion, the best Pizza you will find in the valley.  Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I'm not the only one that thinks so ;)"}
{"text":"The avocado pizza was splendid, the Sonoma garden salad had me at beets and the delicious cookies made our night. We want to thank Steph and Cat for spoiling us. You shed some serious positive energy and good vibes on us tonight. Thank for going above and beyond!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been flying I out of PhoenixSkyharbor and this is by far the best place to eat in the airport! Have to get the Kale salad with chicken! Yumm"}
{"text":"I came in for the first time today and I met a wonderful employee named Caitlin who couldn't have been nicer or more helpful! Absolutely the best customer experience I have experienced her patience with me was really great and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I would say LGO , is constantly \" on Point\" . They have the best of  salads , sandwhich and Pizza, all are superlative.."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. Food was excellent. Highly recommend the tortilla chip appetizer. Also had one of their pizzas for the main course.   Chips: came with three dips, a traditional salsa, a cheese dip and guacamole. All three were delicious. They also sell the cheese dip in their store next door.   Pizza: the dough was incredible. The toppings were all fresh.   Service: our server was Dustin. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of the entire menu including alcohol and dessert. He recommended an excellent Gelato for dessert and an excellent pilsner.   Highly recommend this place and we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Always great service, gluten free friendly, and great atmosphere! Their gluten free pizza is the best I've ever had and they have amazing salads as well. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not order pineapple on your pizza. You'll end up with HUGE ridiculous chunks of pineapple on a super thin soggy pizza. Almost impossible to eat. The only think I actually liked there was the chips and guacamole."}
{"text":"Here is my review in a nutshell:  We live in Chandler and will drive here to pick up a pizza and take it home to eat.  It is THAT good and worth the trip.  We always get a margherita pizza with sausage and garlic.  We have eaten it in the restaurant, but most of the time we bring it home.  My husband turns on our oven to 450 degrees and puts the whole pizza on a pizza stone for about 3 minutes.  The pizza is perfect and delicious.  We devour it and always wish there was one more piece.  As we are reaching for the last pieces I always notice the look on his face (and I know I have the same look) of longing....wishing there was more.  I'm drooling now just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here.  The crust is tender, bready but slightly crunchy as well . . .not as crunchy as the most authentic Italian pizzas, but i don't think they're trying to replicate an Italian pizzeria.  The crust tastes like it's been glazed with a subtle amount of something . . . a butter blend?  but just the right amount so it isn't dry, or greasy.  Mouth-watering.  Contemporary and wonderful.  Bless you."}
{"text":"Next door to the LGO grocery is the pizzeria.  I had the Mushroom Party pizza - thin crust pizza featuring a trio of mushrooms.  It was so good I even ate the crust and I never eat pizza crust.  The homemade lemonade goes great with the meal too!"}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza I have ever had!  I ate the entire pizza myself!! This tasted so normal and good, I couldn't stop! :)  I had the Fallen Angel with it's delicious thin crust (almost flatbread style), sauce, cheese, and toppings.    Now if you can please lower that horrible new loud music so we can enjoy conversations at the table without shouting and without headaches. With concrete floors, there is not exactly good soundproofing in the place to absorb the sound."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Definitely recommend eating here. The customer experience is a bit unique in that you order your meal in the grocery and once pick it up, you can then find a place to sit either inside or outside. We had the \"Hot Sammy\" and the Gladiator pizza and both were absolutely outstanding!"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the fuss is about. First off, figuring out where to order and where to get food is very confusing.  On top of that,  drinks are ordered in a separate line entirely,  adding even more to the confusion. They charge the same prices as a sit down place,  yet no one serves you.  And lastly, the food was just OK. I got the avocado pizza and it was just OK, nothing special.  The pizza was super greasy and I couldn't figure out what cheese they use,  but it wasn't mozzarella.  The dough tasted like it was sourdough,  which I'm not a fan of. I wouldn't come here again unless I have no other choice."}
{"text":"Such good food and drinks! Happy hour includes $5 cocktails, wine and beer, though no food. Cocktails here were absolutely delicious though! The kambucha mule was seriously yummy, and we stayed so long for HH that we just decided to get dinner too...best decision ever! The pizza was one of the best I've ever had in Phoenix, and I think I've explored this city's pizza scene quite a bit. Tried the Fallen Angel pizza and the market pizza, both of which were amazing. I'd highly recommend his place, especially with the happy hour drink prices. The pizza, though not discounted for HH, ranges from $12-15 which is perfectly reasonable for how delish it is."}
{"text":"Woah talk about confusing, starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door, right through the kitchen.. still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do. Nobody said anything if it wasn't. Then what? Looked around for a hostess, didn't see one - were we supposed to seat ourselves or get in line? Which line? The big one going out the door? The coffee station? The pastry station? Did we have to go to each one for something different? Would have asked somebody if there had been anyone to ask. Like I said, confusing. Won't be that way for you, of course, because I'm going to lay it all out for you...  Ok, so there ain't really all that much to lay out.. It's pretty simple, actually. Split up, that's my advice - one of yous grab a table - there aren't many when they're busy - and somebody else get in line - doesn't matter which one. We ordered everything we needed from the coffee station. Apparently that's a secret, because the other one was going out the door, like I said.  The food - we shared the french pancakes, these super thin little slices of Heaven, and the tofu \"chorizo\" burrito. Rockin' good breakfast. Very tasty, and a nice change of pace. Beware: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and jam packed with pulp. Cool if that's your thing, not so much if it ain't.  And in retrospect, all that confusion - was all kind of part of the charm of the place. Weird, huh?"}
{"text":"Picked up two orders of wings and a chips plater. The wings were ready quicker then the time we were told but we were stuck waiting on the chips for 10 minutes, what was frustrating was the fact that we could see it all sitting in the window. Once we got home we opened it all up to see a more than chunky guacamole. Which included the sticker of the avacado as well as the eye. Bland and unseasoned to say the least. Service and quality were poor."}
{"text":"A really nice and decorative restaurant. I highly suggest their wings and fries."}
{"text":"Just got back from a quick trip to LGO, tummy is full and happily satisfied :)  Three of us arrived around 6pm, had no problem finding a parking spot, lucky! And we were seated immediately after walked in(people started waiting for tables around 6:15ish) Here are the items we shared: + half a dozen of baked chicken wings for app. (baked and grilled with point reyes blue cheese) - the sauce (buffalo?) was a bit too sour... + A Mushroom Party - yummmmyyy! the mushrooms are so fresh! + Fallen Angel - always great :) + Three glasses of LGO ice tea - I love their ice tea with a slice of orange inside, yes, not lemon, but orange!!  Total $44.40 excluding tip. (and some leftover for tomorrow's lunch :). A bit pricy but totally worth it! And great and attentive service!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed!  My kind of place...  Great service (thanks Cara!), really good food and a very good wine selection.  The best prices on a bottle of wine!  Casual atmosphere...  My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Very ordinary. Our gladiator pizza was similar to a totinos. Excellent desserts and shrimp cervichi."}
{"text":"Mmmmm...went for the first time but rap music so loud my friend and I were screaming at each other!  Went to Postinos instead...sad coz I really wanted to try their Gelato. ..oh well..will try again another time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chocolate chip and seal salt cookies ...top notch gelato . Very crowded on weekend mornings and sometimes the wait can be frustrating. Worth it for me ."}
{"text":"(6/26/2010-lazy posting skills) I've heard about LGO for years but never made an effort to find it or try it until recently.  First time at LGO after a brisk morning walk with my group. After staring at the menu for 10 minutes and getting jostled around by the morning crowd, our party of four came down to these choices: two jersey girl omelets, a daybreaker omelet, and pancakes.  Delicious!  I had a jersey omelet and was enlightened by the huge hunks of pastrami, potatoes, onions and chives embedded my omelet. This morning it was also served with a side berries and two pieces of toasted pumpernickel that made a lovely complement to the pastrami. I didn't get to try the daybreaker, but my friend's plate of turkey, cut cherry tomatoes (lots of spillage, which I love) and smushy, yummy chunks of avocado is making me count down the days until I can schedule another visit!  The crepes looked amazing as well.  I've never had a Havana coffee before, so I gave it a whirl once they told me it had condensed milk.  Growing up with my dad's coffee concoction of milk, coffee, and condensed milk, I didn't think anyone would ever get it.  And then came LGO's Havana coffee.  Now, I'm hooked for life!  I love their Havana Coffee and plan on stopping in again to check out their other breakfast dishes (the Daybreaker!),  Their pizza also looks yummy - will have to check that out as well.   It was also fun to wander around the gourmet/eclectic grocery while we waited for our orders, although we learned quickly that we had to have someone secure a table in the pizzeria or else it would be standing room with your plate.  I saw a lot of neat things stationary and knick knacks for sale, but it was at eclectic prices, so I had to pass.  I did find it cool that they had a few local artists' goods for sale as well.    I can't wait to come back!  Parking is a premium, as many before me have mentioned, so a few recommendations: park across Campbell at the small lot or at the Arcadia Room (also owned by LGO), go for valet parking in the back of LGO, or hope for the best and try to wait for a parking space in the front.  Just don't be \"that person\" and block traffic!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the food and shopping area. Additionally, the staff has been increasingly friendlier in the last year and it has been awesome.   My biggest complaint is the variety of music played. I'm here for morning meetings and really enjoy the convenient location but am bummed that rap with sexual undertones is blasted over the speakers. I think an alternative choice of rap (even just songs that don't mention banging two women or getting it on) would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and chill atmosphere. Besides the horrible parking, if I could go here everyday, I would!"}
{"text":"Not only did the marketing department of this restart  reach out to me regarding my review- I received and ecomp for my next time In. I am looking fwd to it! That's great customer service."}
{"text":"Tip: try the avocado pizza with prosciutto! They also have kombucha and a ton of beers on tap that you can bring home in a growler (your own or one you purchase from them)."}
{"text":"I decided to go give LGO another chance.  My experience was totally different the second time around.  The hostess was standing at the hostess stand when I entered the restaurant and promptly greeted and sat my party and I.  The waitress, Jessica, quickly arrived at our table, introduced herself and took drink orders.  Shortly after bringing the drinks, Jessica took our orders. This night I had the goat cheese pizza, my party ordered the Gladiator Pizza and the veggie pizza on thin crust.  All of the pies were excellent.  This was a 5 star experience, I even tipped Jessica extra! I only gave 4 stars due to the horrible customer service upon my first experience. Thanks for the excellent service recovery LGO!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about atmosphere... this is one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Good food, good vibe, good people, and the occasional grant hill sighting. Big fan of LGO!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner so LGO is like a second home for me. Everyone who works here is incredibly friendly and I consider them a second family. Since I work remote, I spend a lot of time working at the bar. Lindsey makes incredible cocktails, and always makes me feel at home."}
{"text":"Showed up on a Fri. night and was told the wait would be about 20 mins, which was expected. What was unexpected was that they were holding a complimentary wine tasting in the Java Garden so I would have a free buzz going before even sitting down. The house sangria was delicious and we split a couple of pizzas - the avocado and another vegetarian one that I don't recall the name of. Both were very good and I wouldn't hesitate to have either one again although I will probably try something new next time. It is very worth the prices, especially if you are buying wine by the bottle."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ hands down.. Parking is a cluster f$&4 but well worth it.. I would love to see a larger location in a different part of the valley."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is my favorite restaurant right now. The food is absolutely outstanding! I am a big fan of the \"Gladiator Pizza\". Everything tastes fresh and so delicious. They also have amazing selections of gelato, which is always amazing. Thumbs up for LGO!"}
{"text":"Great gluten free pizza.   The price was just right, the appetizer was great too.   Customer service was great too."}
{"text":"The Orange is a popular, well-reputed joint in my neighborhood. The Pizzaria is connected to a small bakery and deli. IMO, it's overpriced and over-rated. The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars.   There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)  I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.  I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though. If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones, this place might just be for you."}
{"text":"First time here..La Grande Orange Pizzeria blew me away! In fact it was one of the best pies that I've ever had."}
{"text":"Highlights: pizza, baked goods, and salads."}
{"text":"Oh me, oh my. What great food. The salads were a little lame, but my friend and I got the pizza that was supposed to have corn. We ended up nixing the corn and going with pepperoni. The goat cheese on it was fantastic. Great spot."}
{"text":"The staff at the store and bakery is simply delightful, and the place/food are great. I had a light breakfast there one morning, so I was excited about having dinner at the Pizzeria three nights later. Here's how the hostess, after rolling her eyes and sighing, greeted me: \"You know, you COULD sit at the bar. Then I won't have to seat you.\" Um...no. I left, and won't be back there. But I WILL continue to patronize the store."}
{"text":"Came back to LGO for an afternoon meal.....fantastic rotisserie chicken sandwich and Cesar salad! As was before, the service at the restaurant and store is suburb. Definitely recommend that you pay them a visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new pizzeria that offers pizza toppings that will leave you feeling a bit healthy without compromising on taste, then this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza!  It was wonderfully crispy, but not burned.   I also had the Orange Fennel Salad.   I adore the baked goods, especially the cookies which are huge and yummy.   If your in the area, stop in, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So pizza is mine and my husbands favorite, and this is truly the best pizza in the phx area. It's truly amazing--the sourdough crust makes my mouth water just thinking of it. We always get the avocado pizza and we have them add corn, then we sprinkle the sea salt they have on the table--it's amazing! Go!"}
{"text":"LGO is a little chaotic for me.  I will say though, the pastry case never disappoints."}
{"text":"i'm a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, but the teasty menu here is quite nice and very surprising. LOVED the avocado pizza, something about the creaminess of the avocado on the tasty crust. looks fantastic too, as does all their pizzas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Our favorite is the mushroom pizza. The atmosphere is fun and food is fantastic. My boyfriend had a drink in a growler.. I think we were there for about two hours until he finished it. Good thing we live close lol. We go here about once every few months. It's a great local favorite."}
{"text":"BAD.  As a local, I have been going to LGO off and on for years.  I have never been impressed with their service (or lack of parking).  Today was the worst ever.  Since it's always so crowded, I waited until after the lunch rush to stop by.  I ordered a salad at 1:40 p.m.  At 2:00, I inquired.  The person who said she would check on it never came back.  Three other employees asked me if I needed assistance, all seeming very confused.  At 2:15, my salad finally appeared, and was basically thrown at me by the server - without apology!  I ordered the Thai  chicken salad.  It was a meager serving, for $10.00.  It also was very bland tasting.   Very unimpressed with the food, service and overall attitude of LGO.  With so many great restaurants around, there is no need to go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best cheese on a pizza I've ever had. The sauce is very good and the oven-baked pizza is very tasty.   Negatives: an insult to the word 'parking'. My 1st visit, I had some of the WORST service to date. We were taken to our table, and we waited, probably a good 20 minutes until somebody came to take our drink order. Should of ordered our food at that time, because we didn't get our drinks, nor anybody to take our food order, for ANOTHER 15 minutes or so. In addition, if you get soda, you get a can, so NO FREE REFILLS.   The Caesar salad was pretty good, but came with a bit too much dressing and Parmesan cheese for my taste. The little shops next to the pizzeria was pretty cool. The ambiance of the restaurant was cool, and the pizza was good, but with horrible service, its hard to support this place.  I'll go back one more time to see if my experience improves."}
{"text":"I just started using Yelp again and responded to a message that the management had sent me in response to my post from 2013. They immediately called me and encouraged me to give them another try since they had made changes as a result of the problem we experienced. Will post a follow-up  review on next visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my staple restaurants that consistently provides great service and great food. They have many items on the menu including delicious chicken wings, salads, multiple pizza options (including gluten-free pizzas) and one of the best burgers in town.   The place offers a great casual neighborhood vibe and is also wonderful for kids. Try a scoop of the house-made pistachio gelato after dinner - DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I went with a group and the service was really great. The variety of food and speediness to the table impressed me. And as a group we played on the variety of food items and weren't disappointed. I'll never understand however in a place that's loud anyway from all the people and activity of serving and kitchen open, why the music ever is played as loud as it is. With all the other distractions I'd have appreciated that being knocked down a notch or three. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Let's make this clear up front. I wanted to LOVE it. I really, really did. We live close by and have always heard LGO is the best neighborhood spot in Arcadia.. so tonight we decided this was the night to try it. Maybe it was an off night? Let's start by saying parking to pick up is a beast. The hubby didn't want to wait in the 8 car deep parking lot line so he parked nearby and hoofed it. Hey, being that busy is a GREAT sign! When he tried to pick up there was confusion about which computer our order was on.. which seemed odd.. but it was found, paid, and he was on his way. We ordered an Avacado Pizza with prosciutto and a Ceaser salad. When I saw the Ceaser I was instantly disappointed in the quality of the romaine and the size of my 8$ salad. There was a thin layer of romaine, most of which had gotten wilted and the orange tint from having been cut and put in the box a while ago. The croutons were soft- not sure if that was intentional but I love crisp croutons and that further disappointed. The pizza was good, nice crust, nice toppings and met expectation- but wasn't so unbelievably good (or such a good value) that I can't wait to go back.   Edited to add: Just a few minutes after posting my review we received a phone call from a manager at LGO.  The manager, Kathy, was on the phone apologizing for the less than stellar experience. She explained that she checked the remaining Ceaser salads and trashed them and offered us a replacement. That made a huge impression on my husband and myself- I appreciate they took the time to immediately correct the problem and reach out to us. She went above and beyond to correct the situation which in my book gets them another star. It says a lot about who you are and what you stand for when there is a problem and it is handled in this way. You've earned our future visit!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at this place.  I was in town for work, and one of the locals recommended it when I asked where I can get a good pizza.  The quality of the pizza itself was outstanding, very upscale but yet still simple and fresh.    The appetizers were really good as well, I had the chips and dip tray (oh my god the pimento cheese dip) and their take on insulata caprese.  The tomatoes were roasted and amazing, one of the best capreses I've ever had.    They are a little on the pricey side, but totally worth it for what you get.  I probably wouldn't take younger kids here but it's a great place for a date night.    Complimentary valet parking was pretty sweet, too, just make sure you have a couple bucks cash to toss the valet."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of LGO for quite some time.  Whenever my husband and I go here we always leave with smiles on our faces.  We have been here countless times and never had one bad experience.    When my husband saw the picture of the green chili burger on the LGO FaceBook page yesterday, he decided two things: #1-he wanted to go here for lunch and #2-he wanted that delicious looking burger.  So we went and yes, parking isn't easy and there is always a line but we don't care about that because we always find a spot and the line goes really quickly (plus there is fun stuff to peruse while waiting in line).  It also helps that our mouths were watering for their food!    The staff is always friendly and helpful and yesterday was no exception.  I also appreciate how the managers here are part of the team-expediting food orders and cleaning tables-while still smiling and being friendly to customers.  That is awesome.  So back to the food.  I got the pizzeria chop salad with no raisins and no olives and it was fantastic.  Luckily for me, my husband likes to share his food and my two bites of his green chili burger were OUTSTANDING.  Messy, but delicious.  The fries were great too.  We both tried something we hadn't tried from the menu before and again, we left with smiles on our faces talking about how yummy our lunch was.  That is a definite win-win situation-thank you LGO for being consistently delicious and for having a staff that rocks!!"}
{"text":"WoW!   A must visit when near Phoenix. Wish there is a place like this in the OC"}
{"text":"Love their BLT, and their pizza.....mmmm.  One of my favorite local pizza joints.  Right there with The Parlor, Bianco, etc...  Never tried their breakfast but rumor has it....it's good!!"}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying I that I love and hate this place.  The food is awesome so there is a chance I will be back. I had their margherita pizza and it was outstanding. The sourdough crust was chewy and their ingredients tasted fresh. It was probably one of my favorite pizzas I have ever had.   But, I absolutely hate how crowded the grocery store is and how difficult it is to stand in line to order. However, I do like the items they have in the store.   Don't think you will find a parking spot. There is valet available in the evening but not for lunch. Plus, then you have to pay for parking (ie. tip the valet).  It is such a production just trying to get the food that I had to knock the review down to three stars. But, if you don't mind the effort, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything here that I don't like. The pizza, the wings, several desserts, drinks and ice cold beer. It's all great, and the service is usually okay, too. There's lots of cute stuff to look around at in the grocery while you're waiting, although most of it is overpriced. I'm dinging one star for the awful parking."}
{"text":"I wish I could give La Grande Orange 10 stars. This place has high quality food, pleasant atmosphere and wonderful staff. Love this place..."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Pizzeria since it has opened and always have enjoyed the restaurant. My last visit was below average. The service was weak, the pizza was extremely bland, salads a 3 star and LGO sure is proud of their prizes for what one gets.  It's always sad to see a good restaurant go to the way-side."}
{"text":"I love love love their pizzas! They have a great one called \"The Padre\", which is not on the menu, but has prosciutto, fig, and arugula on it. It is lovely! My friends and I always get this one when we come here and enjoy it with a refreshing pitcher of their rosemary lemonade (with vodka, of course!). Other notable pizzas I've had are the Mother Earth, Rocket Man, and Roasted Corn (love goat cheese on pizza!).   Also, great atmosphere, nice servers, and it's connected to a gelato place to boot!"}
{"text":"As there are already 200 reviews let me be brief:  Vegetarian sandwich, I love you!   Tasty onion bread, slightly sweet and moist, with just enough texture Perfectly roasted yellow bell peppers Cheese...can't remember what type but delish Perfectly cut cucumbers.  Who talks about the slicing of a cucumber? Me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places because of the variety of options.  Sit at the communal table in the pizzeria and watch the pies being hand tossed and dressed right before your eyes.  Salads are fabulous too and the sangria is delicious and fresh.  The grocery next door has amazing baked goods, salads and cheeses to go.  A great place to put a picnic together, or eat at the patio tables in front.  Wonderful wine selection and unusual cards and gifts if you're in need of a hostess present or just enjoy shopping.  Overall, a wonderful place to be from breakfast to dinner, centrally located between Scottsdale and Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went to LGO on a girls night out and I was impressed and am already itching to go back and take my husband. We ordered a pizza that had prosciutto, fig and ricotta cheese. It was heavenly. I'm normally not a huge fan of pizza but this is not traditional pizza. My favorite part was the artichoke appetizer with a mayo dip."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the Valley. Hands down. (Sourdough crust, YUM.)  But... there are a few precautions to consider.   1. Price is a bit high especially considering the portions and atmosphere, but I believe the quality is worth it.   2. When busy, it gets a bit chaotic which causes discomfort for newbies. They are setup as a market/restaurant and serve pizza on the weekends and after 4pm during the week. I recommend a later dinner during the week with the understanding that you may need to wait. The dining is cozy and unique, but it can get a bit loud.   3. The service is pretty laid back and generally very kind, but their casual nature can be taken as lack of attention.   All of these things in consideration, they are great at what they do and cater to the locals that can appreciate it. If expect a structured, chain-restaurant, cookie-cutter style experience, this is not the place.  They are unique, quaint and make delicious pizza. (Wings are fabulous as well). I have been going here for years, and can't get enough.  My Recommended Dinner for Two:  Appetizer: 6 wings ( Warning: They are spicy)  Pizza: Margherita add Red Sauce and Pepperoni  Dessert: Slice of Red Velvet Cake"}
{"text":"so i've always loved this place.... it continues to expand and grow. breakfast is wonderful and light, homemade english muffins for egg and avocado sandwiches = awesome!  fruit mixtures are  tasty.  great coffee and sweets.  then we have the pizza!!  fresh local ingredients sourdough crust, variety of flavors and toppings.  really nice atmosphere and some of the BEST chicken wings i've had in the city...or anywhere!  no wonder why i love this place"}
{"text":"The pizza is like CPK but a whole lot better. Their pizza won't make you feel guilty after you eat it, very fresh ingredients with a light crust.  I've had a fantastic arnold palmer, sangria, and red velvet cake here as well."}
{"text":"Wowie what an amazing pizzeria! These guys know how to handle ingredients well and employ them in amazing ways to create an absolutely phenomenal pie! Fantastic!!  LGO's also taught me a valuable lesson. Sometimes, the best pizzas aren't the meat-lovers ones but the VEGETARIAN options. What?! I know, I had to swallow a lot of pride to accept that but it is truth!  My Fallen Angel pizza with its yummy sausage just paled in comparison to my companions' vegetarian orders. The Mother Earth pizza is rife with just awesome vegetable ingredients and flavors. It was like a beautiful medley of music when I bit into a slice of that!  And the Rocketman with its garlic infusions, that was just clutch! I am in love with this pizzeria and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Summary: food okay, service appalling.   Went for a quick bite at 8:30 on a Saturday evening. Place was at half capacity. Waited, according to sign, for the Maitre D' to seat the party; after a couple of minutes and no Maitre D' anywhere to be seen and under the careless looks of the waitresses passing by, seated ourselves at the long table across from the kitchen.   Server approached and took the drinks order and the food order simultaneously, as we stated that we were really hungry, then came back with the drinks and disappeared. We waited patiently for the pizzas to bake. In the meantime, the, what we learned later, Maitre D entered the scene. It had been 10 minutes since we had set foot at the restaurant. No eye contact nor any acknowledgement of our presence. Didn't seem to care at all, as she would have probably noticed that there were four people sitting at the table with four napkins and no silverware. There was a bunch of knives at her station, along with what looked like a giant slab of Parmesan, just left there unattended on top of some napkins, well within my reach. I could have taken it and rubbed it all over my head, if I wanted to. Nobody would have noticed.   So after a short while finally the Maitre D' appeared, not with the silverware, but with the ready pizzas. We asked for silverware, as we were very hungry and wanted to eat. Right. Away. She asked if we wanted some Parmesan on the pizza. We said yes on the one and no on the other, but, above all, could we get some silverware, as we are, after all, civilized people. She grabbed the slab of Parmesan from above my head and started grating it over the pizza, obviously not being able to process the concept of silverware. I did not want to intimidate her, because I remembered the knives at her station, and she looked angry that someone was interfering with her critical act of grating cheese.   Finally our waitress appeared again and we begged for some silverware. She went somewhere and came back with two forks and one knife on a plate and threw them on the table. Two forks and one knife  For four people. We started losing hope. I was only glad we ordered pizzas and not a salad. Salad is really difficult to eat with hands only. Finally at the fourth attempt, all was corrected, there were forks and knives for everyone, and joy and peace and pizza. Pizza was totally okay, but, again, it's pizza. My friends, who have been going to this place for 10+ years love it, though, and drove 30 miles to go there.   At some point a young man by the name of Henry Hanson, Manager, approached the table and asked if everything was okay. All of us said yes, we had just needed some forks and knives but now all was peachy. He left, only to come back in 10 minutes. Obviously he was bored or sad or lonely and needed to talk to someone. I actually wanted to eat pizza and was not really ready to make new friends. He again asked what happened and stated that his staff was feeling insulted by our demand to have knives and forks, suggested we would apologize. Well I refuse to apologize for not wanting to eat, what is being marketed as gourmet pizza, with my fingers and explained the basic concept of service business - when you satisfy your reasonable customer's needs properly, nobody would feel insulted. In fact, I felt insulted by Mr. Hanson, Manager, that I would have to accept to eat like a wild man, only to protect his staff's feelings.   We finished, paid, tipped 18% and left the restaurant. We were followed in the parking lot by Mr. Hanson, Manager, and asked not to come back to this restaurant, because of our interaction with the staff. Or else he'd put up a big beautiful wall around it. Ok, he didn't really say the last part.   Actually we would have never even thought of going back there, at least as long as this place employs inadequately trained service staff, who obviously have serious deficits in common sense and no clue of fundamental customer service principles.   So my advise to any future patrons:  One: bring your own silverware  Two: don't demand anything from the staff. In fact, just reach out for that Parmesan, it's been sitting there in the open for hours. Just nibble on it, you'll be fine.  Three: don't talk, laugh, breathe, move, or do anything that might insult the staff. They are very emotional human beings and are not there to cater to any of your needs, quite the contrary, you are there to cater to their emotional needs and pay them for that.  Four: actually try not to go there at all. Everyone will be happy!"}
{"text":"I can never decide what to order when I come here because everything looks so appealing. I can never pass up on the desserts and coffees. I love how you can either sit down for a nice lunch/dinner or take something to go!"}
{"text":"I prefer this place for lunch and Postino's for dinner. They are both awesome places and it's a shame to hear about the falling out between the owners. But it is what it is, business is business. Both places are fantastic and definitely one of a kind. I just moved back here from LA recently and have been looking for a place with this VIBE and I am glad to have found it here. I love this place, especially because it's in the neighborhood. I've been back many times and will continue frequenting. The grocery is like a place of little treasures you can't find anywhere else. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking, flavors, fun, adventure, and just that \"wow I found a new great place\" kind of experience. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this spot a few months ago with two friends, and we made the mistake of \"sharing\" the orange fennel salad...we were literally fighting over it! Wish I lived closer because I'd probably head over once a week just for that amazing salad. Also ordered the green chili burger on the GIGANTIC English Muffin, which was tasty with a little kick. Ended the meal with a decadent salty n' sweet chocolate chip cookie from the adjacent bakery...and by then I was in a delightful food coma."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience at dinner last night!  First, there was only a 15 minute wait and we were seated within 5 -10 minutes. Then, our server (Kara) was cheerful and fabulous. She helped me figure out if I should order the nachos for my 4 year old (which I did and she enjoyed them immensely.  She also had french fries - these are magically delicious! I could come here just to eat french fries all night. The food was delicious. I had the green chile burger on the english muffin. It really is the best burger in town! My friend has the gladiator pizza. He seemed to enjoy it as well. The only thing I didnt like is the iced tea. I do not like the new iced (and that was my fault because I didnt ask which iced tea it was), next time I will make sure I order a soda or something."}
{"text":"The roasted corn pizza was absolutely delicious! And, the LGO chips and dips plate (guacamole, salsa, & pimento dip) as an appetizer was amazing. The grocery shop next door is very pleasant as well... Lots of cute items and yummy desserts. Aside from Phoenix, AZ apparently there are other LGO locations in Santa Monica and Pasadena... Wish there was one in NorCal. In summary, this place is fantastic!  The only con: this place is always busy... However, the wait is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I feel this place is over rated and definitely a trendy hipster place to go. The free valet parking is ok but you have to tip so no free parking. The mushroom pizza we ordered was very greasy and bland. The kale quinoa salad was fresh and delish and dressing refreshing. Also I took a lemon creamsicle cupcake home that was very good but very greasy just like the pizza. I would go again but just order a salad and dessert."}
{"text":"Dear LGO - I'm pretty sure I'm done. Thanks so much for all of the marginal meals I've had at your restaurant. Once upon a time you rocked, alas, no longer. I will bid today my final farewell. Here is the jist....do I mind the snarky, lousy attitude staff? not really, do I care that there is never anywhere to park? nope, thats not it as I can always valet...the bottom line is when you add it all up....bad service, wicked crowded, completely overpriced, lack of organic options, your staffs amazingly entitled attitude, ALONG with marginal food? no thanks! I will take my 15 dollar breakfast elsewhere. As a last note, the screaming by the order up guy kills me....constant screaming of names, when I was there, I felt like I was stuck in a time warp at tutor time. As to negate any bad karma, good luck in 2013."}
{"text":"OMG we loved this pizza.  the Padre is wonderful.  We went early in the evening and the crowd was not so bad."}
{"text":"Before I go into detail about Le Grande Orange Pizzeria let me say I am a huge fan of LGO in general.  The parking is cramped and the ordering process for breakfast or lunch can be totally chaotic but it is solid every time I go.  They chilaquiles are to die for!    The pizza is solid and the menu has a lot of unique toppings but it is waaaay overpriced.  The pizzas are very small but yet cost close to $20 if you add a few toppings.  You can go to any place in town (Bianco, Cibo, Grimaldis) and get more food for equal or less money.  There are too many options for pizza in the Phoenix area to settle on LGO."}
{"text":"AHmazing! The best pizza ever!! Totally worth waiting for a table if they are busy....oh And we loved the red velvet cake yummy :0)"}
{"text":"WTH?!?!?, Very disappointed, been coming here for years, they changed the pizza recipe and it's really bad!  Was this a fluke, or did LGO just get too big and forget what was important?"}
{"text":"I love LGO for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The commuter breakfast sandwich is delicious and is usually served with a few fresh slices of fruit for breakfast. The smoked salmon salad is perfect to grab on your way out for a quick to-go lunch full of protein-rich sustenance and a perfect dressing. And for dinner? Oh man, the pizza. I love the avocado pizza, and adding the prosciutto is an absolute must. The creamy avocado with the salty prosciutto and little hint of lemon with the cheese and crispy crust is just to die for. I love it. The appetizers are perfect too - especially the dip trio (the cheese dip!) and the wings.   Skip over to the bar for a happy hour cocktail, grab a gift for a friend in the shop, make a cheese plate and grab some wine in the grocery, grab some dessert to enjoy at home (don't skip the gelato - or the pudding, or the red velvet cake...) - this place is wonderful. Always."}
{"text":"Don't really have anything original to say here, just another big win thanks to Yelp! The roasted corn pizza was indeed the best part of the night. GET IT. Avocado pizza with lemon zest was also good, but we'll probably switch that one up next time. Split a pitcher of white sangria between three of us, definitely yummy. Not very strong but great flavor. We were way too full to try the gelato but plan on that next time!  We had a lot of fun walking through the grocery beforehand as well, lots of unique and fun things, as well as AMAZING smells. Oh, that homemade pizza crust...yum."}
{"text":"My entire family went here yesterday to celebrate Father's Day and it was a hit! The pizza was delicious, and we were thrilled that they had a vegan option for our daughter. We also had the pizzeria chop salad that easily served two. Our son had the turkey french dip which was also a favorite. Ended the meal with gelato and affogatos, Definitely will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"LGO is a great little spot for Sunday lunch after a day of shopping.  Located on a corner with more than one restaurant to choose from made parking difficult but we finally found a spot.  Pretty crowded for 5:00 on Sunday, but we only had to wait about 20 min. and went next door to check out the grocery store.  We were going to get a bottle of wine and open it with dinner but there was a $9 charge to do so, so we opted out.   Tried the ceviche as an app...being a big time ceviche fan I was not really impressed...was that an olive I tasted?  hmmm.... now to pizza.  Between 5 of us we decided to try the avacado pizza, the fallen angel and the padre (each pizza serves 2).  Although I Iove avacado's the lemon on that pizza was just a little too much for me, the fallen angel was good, with tasty fennel sausage, but the padre took the cake!  This was the only pizza that had no leftovers, the prosciuto, arugula, fig and ricotta was a combination I had never tried, but was absolutely delicious.     Too bad we were too stuffed for dessert, I would have loved to try the gelato spot next door...maybe next time."}
{"text":"Sorry but we were disappointed. Our pizza was lacking in pizazz, sauce was bland, toppings were imaginative but again lacking flavor, pizza was small for $16 w/tax. Ours was the olive combo (green and black) with broccoleta. We've had wonderful black olives bursting with flavor, not on this pizza. Green olives can be flavorless and these were in this category. Olives out of a can, not gourmet by any stretch. This is a pretty pretentious place, but pizza is lackluster."}
{"text":"I love this place - definitely one of my favs in Phoenix area. Pizza is great, sandwiches wonderful, burger - I would skip. Today I had the green chile cheese burger on a recommendation of someone I met at Postino's. I don't think he is from New Mexico.   I got the burger and it was huge, with a pile a shredded cheese on top. Not melted shredded cheese just shredded cheese on the burger and chile. On the other side was nice looking pickles, purple raw onion and slices of tomato. I hurriedly smashed the burger sides together in hopes of melting some of the cheese(didn't work). Sliced the burger in half and took a bite. Unfortunately I bit right into the strongest onion I've eaten in years. After that I couldn't taste anything. Especially the green chile, it looked beautiful but I couldn't get any flavor out of it. When I added the sea salt provided on the table it tasted better. The fries were great though. I had a Mirror Pond on tap! That was delicious.   The other thing that I found highly annoying was I needed utensils, napkins and plates so I went to a table in the corner where there was wrapped utensils in white cloth napkins and small plates. I asked the service person if I could get these to take to the table. She said no get them from the other side of the restaurant. Where I found cheap utensils, paper napkins and no plates. I took a large amount of napkins (I have two boys eating pizza) and utensils. My boys didn't enjoy eating off of the wooden board the pizza comes on so my husband got up and just took two plates.   Not FIVE minutes later the woman I spoke to started placing the same wrapped utensils and plates onto the empty tables where the next guests sat. HUH? I understand they were transitioning to dinner but really? You couldn't just hand them to me?   Other than that it's a wonderful place we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Service painfully slow.   Pizza top quality as always.   New turkey sandwich was good."}
{"text":"Here's some irony: I moved to New York City and the restaurant I most miss from Phoenix is a pizza place. Especially the sweet potato pizza in the fall!   Sometimes I crave LGO pizza so much I wanna beg friends to dry ice it and ship it to Brooklyn.  (Forgive me, New York.)"}
{"text":"On a Thursday night this place is crowded but plenty of open tables available. Being a Margarita Queen, I ordered one, which offers freshly squeezed lime juice, Mm. It was delicious! Made me pucker but I couldn't stop drinking them! So pulpy and totally awesome. The white pizza was superb, maybe even better than Cibo (downtown Phoenix)... Yeah, this pizza was the best. The ambiance was relaxed but intimate with dim lighting, candle lit tables, and good service. I'll definitely be going back for this perfect combo :)"}
{"text":"The best Ahi Tuna Sandwich I've ever had in my life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While most people rave about Pizzeria Bianco, I think LGO's pizza is way better. I don't think I've had anything here that I didn't like. It is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant in Phoenix. I highly recommend the roasted corn pizza. I can't come here without ordering it.   Down sides - it's always crowded during typical meal times and unless you're lucky, it's hard to find convenient parking"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, when you can get it. I've been here a few times over the years and the food is reliably amazing, however, service is hit or miss. Either quite good or nearly non-existent, depending on when you go.   Went this morning, and sat for 20 minutes and even made eye contact with a server, but they ignored me, and kept walking by my table like I didn't exist. I finally got the attention of one of them and was told \"Oh, uh...sorry dude, you gotta go to the counter and order. We don't have full service until 5. Sorry man.\"  I used to really love this place, but the last couple of times I've gone, I just ended up walking out because even when they are full service, it's still quite slow. Sadly, this place is too popular for its own good.   That said, the pizza and the gelato are really good, and if you have a lot more patience than me, it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"Typically dine in bar area which has been great every visit. Excellent food with friendly staff. If first time visiting...go Mon.-Fri. to avoid crowd and to get normal bartenders/servers. Brunette with long hair is typically working bar through week days. Very friendly and prompt service!"}
{"text":"The BF and I make a weekly visit to LGO Pizzeria.  The tasty food here is consistent and reliable.  The atmosphere is hip and the staff is attractive with a very funky sense of style.  Craig is a great waiter and remembers all of our ordering quirks including the need for extra Splenda to go with our iced tea.  It's always a hoot to check out his new 'do for the week.  For appetizers, the BF loves to order a half dozen of their Chicken Wings ($7).  The wings are moist with a nice bit of char on them and a zesty wing sauce.  The housemade Point Reyes blue cheese dressing is a nice counterpoint to the slightly spicy wings.  I frequently order the Chopped Turkey salad ($8.25) with fresh greens, tomatoes, egg, avocado, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese and cheddar tossed with both ranch and house vinaigrette.  This salad is technically only available at the LGO Grocery next door, but they will serve you one at the pizzeria if they have one on hand.  I have them dress the salad as usual with a combo of ranch and house vinaigrette, but then I get a side of the Point Reye blue cheese dressing as it's a tasty dip for the turkey and tomatoes.  Sometimes we go for the Shrimp Ceviche ($13) with avocado, tomatoes, jicama and lime juice with house-made tortilla chips.  If we're in the mood for pizza, we order the Gladiator ($14) with Schreiner's sausage and pepperoni, cheese blend and house-made red sauce.  We kick it up a notch and add black olives, broccolini, bacon and lemon zest.  Once in a while we go for broke and have them add a cracked egg to the mix.  I prefer a crisp crust, so I order the pizza \"well done\" to the point where the crust is almost burnt.  It's delicious and a decent stand-in for the ethereal pies at Pizzeria Bianco given that it does not require a wait of three or four hours.  Sometimes we mix it up and order the Fish Sandwich ($14) with house-made slaw.  It's best with fresh halibut.  I order a side of the Russian dressing to oomph up the sandwich.  And the fries they serve along with the sandwich are excellent.  We never order dessert here because we always grab it from the utterly superb Arlecchino Gelateria next door and bring it back to the table to enjoy.  The décor is pleasant with a huge vase in the center of the room that acts as an economic barometer.  The fresh flowers in the vase reach all the way to the ceiling when times are good and the arrangement gets shorter and shorter the worse the economy gets.  All in all, LGO Pizzeria is a great neighborhood yuppie pizza joint."}
{"text":"Brought my folks there while they were in town.  Had pizza, ordered it with spinach and goat cheese. Was delicious.  Only wish that you can get pizza for lunch..."}
{"text":"The attention to detail and food quality has gone down. Receipts accidentally left in your food. Customer service is lower and staff does not listen to their customers orders. I'm a frequent customer and it saddens me to even write this. Please please get it together."}
{"text":"Date night most Fridays for my husband and I. Our go to is the gladiator pizza, bacon wrapped dates, kale salad and basil grapefruit gimlets. Trust me that is what you want to order."}
{"text":"Well I've always heard this place was so insanely busy, so i just never went. If it really is usually as busy as I've heard, then I recommend coming on a Saturday before the dinner rush. I came at 4:30 and was seated immediately.  It was nice to see that they had established a full bar, since I understand it was previously beer and wine only. Cocktails are pricey at $8, but they made them pretty strong, so I'm not too upset.  The Pizza was stunningly good. I ordered the gladiator and my date ordered the mushroom pizza.  The gladiator was basically a meat lovers pizza and they loaded on the toppings.  The mushroom pizza tasted so fresh, i don't think I've ever tasted mushrooms so good!  this may be the best pizza I've tasted in town, but I think I'll have to give it one more try to confirm my original thoughts.  Definite recommendation./Art"}
{"text":"If you can park, then you will have a great experience! Love the vibe, love the fresh homemade options, we always love the food, love the shop- cool, unique items.  It's really popular, so if you can, try to come on an off hour to beat the rush, otherwise just buffer in extra time. Personally I'd say it's worth the wait. I think I come here at least 4-5x a month! Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This places ooozes good taste"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!  Plus this place is really cool, and has the great grocery store next door, really the same place.  Actually skipped dessert at the restaurant and ordered dessert to go on the grocery side."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange serves the best pizza in Phoenix.  Driving by La Grande Orange (LGO), the only distinguishing feature on the facade of the building is its orange color. If you were tempted to stop inside you would probably stick to the self-described \"funky retail grocery\" half of the store that sells quirky cards, artisan wines, and sumptuous baked goods like cheesecakes, dark chocolate brownies, and generously sized cookies displayed in spotless glass cases. The real treat however, is located in the adjoining pizzeria, where executive chef Shay Gau has mastered the art of simple, yet extraordinarily flavorful pizzas, salads, and grilled entrees.  The golden-hued, twelve inch, sizzling pizzas are a feast for the eyes, and a banquet for the taste buds. Airy, yet chewy, the sourdough crust is tender, but with a crunch at the ends. Perfect pairings at LGO include The Gladiator, topped generously with Schreiner's Italian sausage and crispy pepperoni and The Classic Margherita, suiting vegetarians with mozzarella, roasted tomato and fresh, fragrant basil topping its premium red sauce. Another fan favorite is the Fallen Angel pizza, which features crunchy, slightly-sweet and refreshing shaved fennel, roasted peppers, and succulent sun dried tomatoes over Schreiner's Italian sausage.   LGO may offer a simple menu of appetizers, pizza, salads, and burgers, but that doesn't make decision making easy. The star of the appetizers is the LGO Chips and Dips Plate. House-made guacamole, salsa, and pimento dip lined up on a rectangular platter accompany crispy tortilla chips sturdy enough for sampling all the tasty dipping options.  And for dessert?  Chef Shay Gau excels there, too. Along with the already-mentioned glorious baked goods, LGO offers rich gelato and beautifully hand made cakes from their bake shop, boasting all natural ingredients with no preservatives or chemical additives.   The atmosphere is casual and if you go on a busy night, very lively. The packed parking lot on Friday night is a positive reminder of why patrons flock to this favorite neighborhood pizzeria. The warm wood tones of the high tables and booths help cultivate a snug, comfortable dining atmosphere.    Pulling the focus to the center of the room, a towering, grandiose flower arrangement stands with a flurry of yellow, green and red color.  With an open floor design, patrons see the busy chefs at work, adding to the inclusive atmosphere, where the staff is efficient, friendly, and polite."}
{"text":"Wish they had more stars to put.. Love Love this place. Probably one of my fav. places  in the valley.  I'd like to go for weekend brunch , sometimes during lunch too., even though this place is far for me:)  It has variety of veggie options. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for food items fresh in season."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! The hostess was very nice and accommodating, our waitress was very friendly and the food is unbelievable!!! This is one of my favorite restaraunts. The pizza is sooo good, and the cheeseburger is out of this world! I could go on and on. One \"must try\" is the salted chocolate chip cookie. I dream about it!!"}
{"text":"I have been a 'regular' at LGO for several years now and so I feel pretty comfortable given my extensive experience dining and loitering at LGO to share my thoughts and opinions with the greater community.  Firstly, LGO has a great vibe--it's a haven for 20-something hipsters, posh young families, artsy middle-agers and seniors, hyper five year-olds, and all other walks of life.  You can't enter LGO without feeling instantly happy and energized--Sedona should consider adopting LGO as an additional vortex.  Anyhow, here's my recommendations:  - Breakfast: For a savory meal, try the oh-so fresh Daybreaker Omlette with toast (egg whites with turkey, the freshest and sweetest tomatoes, and avacado; the toast comes with the most delicious jam).  Got a sweet tooth?  Opt for Mia's French Pancakes--this staple somehow masters both tenuous lightness and bodacious decadence at the same time.  Look up magic in Webster's and you'll find a picture of Mia's French Pancakes.   - Lunch: Sonoma Garden Salad is fresh and sweet.  I'm not much of a salad gal, but the Sonoma Garden Salad turns me into a health-nut brontosaurus (fun fact: brontosauri were suckers for leaves).  If you want a light meal with a kick, opt for the Summer Salad Roll--it's a bit spicy, but extremely fresh and hits the spot.   - Dinner: Eats-a-pizza!!  My personal favorite is the Margherita, but you can't go wrong with any selection.  Mushroom Party is pretty fantastic as well.  If you're dining with children, I definitely recommend the PB&J sushi rolls--a sweet treat with sophistication perfect for any tyke.   - Dessert: You can't go wrong with any Tammy Coe confection.  I'm a fan of the mini-cupcakes--a sweet price for just as sweet a baked good that won't spur a post-meal guilt and gym trip.   If you need a sweet wake-up, try the Iced Honey Latte... so yummy!  Of course, the freshly squeezed OJ and made-in-house Arnold Palmers are pretty fantastic picks as well.   You can't go wrong with anything at LGO!  I try to stay as kosher as I can, but my Jewish-turned-agnostic/not-so-Jewish father is an avid fan of the Green Chili Burger and the Rueben sandwich.  (Of course, I've never had either of these so I can't speak much about them as any other selection).  So try them for yourselves and let me know what you think!   Oh and just FYI, the scrumpdiliumptiousness of the food is commensurate with the terror of parking at LGO.  There is complimentary valet in the back by Postino's--just make sure you don't make my mistake of not putting your car into park before getting out of the car and letting your vehicle drive into the luxury car in front of you...  Anyhoo, happy dining and hope you have a sunny time at La Grande Orange!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's go-to spot always. We go here at least once a week. The sourdough crust on their pizza is EVERYTHING. So in love. The ingredients are so fresh and I've never gotten anything bad from them. The wings have amazing flavor.   If you love ranch their homemade ranch is soooo good that I want to buy it in bulk.   Salads are super fresh like everything else. Love the pimento cheese appetizer. You can't go wrong with this place.   The gelato is made of fresh ingredients like everything else. And the gift shop is adorable. SUCH A PERFECT PLACE.   Also I have always gotten good service here. If something is wrong they WILL make it right."}
{"text":"Being from New York and Chicago I have to say these guys know pizza and how to run a class joint. The pizza is by far the best in Arizona and the crust...How do they make something so perfect. I drive from Desert Mountain once a week just to get my fix. I'm not a drinker so the coke in the bottle took me over the edge.   I LOVE THIS PLACE. I would highly recommend this place to anybody in need of a pizza and dessert fix."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm the pizza here is so yummmm  Is it even fair that LGO makes me want to come for breakfast for a coffee and Commuter Sandwich, for lunch for Sushi Roll or Venice Beach Burrito, and then for dinner for a Mother Earth Pizza?!  I need to buy stock in this place...  All the pies are bangin.  Sometimes the wait is long and the pizzeria can get loud but hey, I had to find something negative to say about them.   I heart LGO."}
{"text":"Ceviche, wings, rosat corn pizza... drooooool.   I have eaten here four or five times and can not find ANYTHING to complain about. Service is constantly spot on, food is always good/consistent, and i LOVE sitting at the bar.  I have to agree with Tee D, when i am home for the holiday i will probably feel myself gravitating towards LGO before i brave the hours of wait and hassle at Bianco. It really honestly is just as good but without all the hullabaloo.   They did have a white sangria that was... white (no one told us) and kind of gross but who cares, the mouth watering quality of everything else made that a minor footnote in our dinning experience. Also The gladiator and the padre deserve honorable mention behind my roast corn 'za, all incredible pizzas."}
{"text":"Yesterday i had the Reuben Sandwich for $9.50.  Today i have food poisoning.  In spite of that, i will spend time to critique the sandwich.  There was four times as much cole slaw as meat.  The slaw had a Russian dressing that completelt dominated the other flavors.  The Pastramy had charred portions that added an unpleasant bitter background.  The meat was aldo dry and tough.  The bread had not bern toasted enough and was still bread and not grilled bread.  The best part of the meal were the pickles on the side, which were just average commercial pickles.  I won't go there again in spite of the enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night to meet two friends for dinner - parking is very limited and there are no available overflow areas close by.   Promptly seated, server did a good job, menu had a number of Gluten Free options (important for me!) friends got salads, I got a gluten free pizza. Salads were good, Pizza was good, if a little rubbery.   Bill came to about $45 for the 3 of us, which was totally reasonable. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great atmosphere, and good drinks. I've had the gladiator, roasted corn, and margherita pizzas.. All of which were delicious. The margherita stood out the most to me. The crust is nice and crisp, and the ingredients are fresh. If you don't feel like sitting down at the restaurant then get it to go, it's just as good!"}
{"text":"I know I'm about 10 years late, but went here for the first time Frid. night.  Went with friends, after wasting an hour and a half at Cibo (but that's another story) and had wonderful, friendly service, a great bottle of wine, fantastic shrimp ceviche and gluton-free pizzas!  Definitely will be going back here soon."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is fantastic. The cure items that are sold are darling and unique and you can buy wine!  It's simply fabulous!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, great part of town, and the food is excellent. The place is a quite busy during any day of the week. So plan on some time to look for parking or use the valet. Also, plan on staying for a while because there are so many people service takes a while as well as getting your food.  But, it is well worth it. Just about everything on the menu is great to eat."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town but I had a bad experience today. Ordered a new item for me, San Danielle... when it was served, it was just well... ugly. The sandwich was cut into four pieces and just scattered on the plate and it looked so small. I am used to their sandwiches coming with a small side of mixed fruit but mine came with a quarter of a gala apple... it wasn't even deseeded (is that the right term?). The sandwich tasted okay, but not great. Okay, so I know that people are cutting corners, but for the price i'd expect a little more care with the presentation and a bit more product. I love this place and will be back, maybe my experience was a one off, but has any one else noticed these sorts of 'changes'?"}
{"text":"Hip L.A. like ambiance. Great variety of food. All 5 star. The Best Gelato in town is it's kept secret.  Ride your bike here and sit outside enjoying amazing Camelback Mountain views. Only down fall is that is crazy busy during lunch hour and parking can be trickie. If you have not yet checked it out you have been missing out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when in Phoenix. It has a kitchy, adorable, laid-back atmosphere and always has a fun soundtrack. It has a mini, super fancy grocery store where you can get great wine deals and adorable trinkets and gifts. They serve breakfast all day, so I definitely recommend the Croque Madame. It's hands down my favorite breakfast. If you're feeling lunch-y, you can head over to the LGO pizzaria and try the Gladiator, which has delicious sausage from Schreiner's Sausage (the best in Phoenix). It has a great patio, which is perfect this time of year. It draws a regular crowd, so you usually end up making friends with the other customers. I highly recommend this restaurant (especially for some hearty food after a hike on Camelback mountain)."}
{"text":"Really the gladiator pizza is my favorite outside of Italy! Sourdough crust makes it really great. Love the atmosphere too"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I love the fact that you can order in or just grab a quick salad to go. The service is great and the atmosphere is adorable. Also their food presentation is perfect!"}
{"text":"LGO has a fantastic wine bar with a relaxed atmosphere. Happy hour prices on wine are unbeatable, and the staff are very attentive. I plan on coming back every week too enjoy the wines service."}
{"text":"LGO not only has unique and delicious pizzas, but fabulous gelato next door! The pizzas I enjoyed most were: the classic Margherita and the mushroom party. I'd love to go back and taste the avocado; LGO pairs unique ingredients together to form tasty delights! Now let's not forget about the dessert! Gelato flavors are made in-house and they use fresh ingredients, which results in naturally and deliciously flavored gelato that is as good as it's going to get in a desert (aka: not in Italy)."}
{"text":"I was looking to pick up a pizza before the NFC Championship game and saw this was nearby to where I live. Had zero expectations walking in and came away satisfied and impressed.   I ordered the Gladiator (sausage and pep) and I added black olives and mushrooms. Upon my first bite, I looked at the rest of the pizza and said, \"I'm finishing this...by myself\".  The cheese, tomato sauce have a bold enough flavor but not rich enough to make you only want to eat a slice or two. The Shrooms are sautéed give it an earthy flavor and the black olives give a bit of salt which I love.   But the crust...oh my. It is thin, a bit chewy and crunchy on the outside. It has a bit of an Asiago flavor as well which I have never had before. Kind of reminded me of an Asiago bagel.   I will definitely be back for more and I suggest you stop by for some great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Both my sisters live in Phoenix and I visit often. My little sister recently tried La Grande Orange Pizzeria due to another hot spot being full. When in town my sister recommended popping in with my mom for a quick bite. I was very impressed! We waited for about 10 minutes for a table, which went by fairly quickly since we browsed in the shop next store.  We debated on buying a bottle of wine to share for our meal (which is such a great deal since they don't charge a corking fee). We decided on margaritas instead. We ordered the pitcher, which is $25, but if you divide by the amount of drinks you get, it's a steal! We had the shrimp ceviche, which was amazing! We decided on a custom made pizza with all the fixing! The pizza had the best crust I've ever had in my life! Overall, the experience was awesome. I will for sure be coming back to LGO my next trip to P-town!!"}
{"text":"Wait a second...I have not written a review!  This is nuts!!!!!  Anyways...I adore this place.  LGO and the pizzeria are my favorite places in the world...lol...I am here at least 4-6 times per week.  It is nuts!  Anyways..the reason I am here all the time is because it is FABULOUS!!!!  This place can never go wrong!  The orange and fennel salad it amazing!  It is the perfect mix and each bite and a delight in your mouth and to your taste buds!  I often get this salad through out the week.  I love the kale and quinoa salad too!  It is my go to salad.  I am obsessed with the avocado pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese and the roasted corn pizza with prosciutto.  I wish I could get enough but I cannot!  The ambiance is awesome! Mr.Lynn is a genius and made this place so welcoming and open.  I love how its so laid back and romantic at the same time.  The parking is difficult, but you expect that since it is so popular!  Now the Peanut Butter Pie!!!  OMG OMG OMG!!  There are no words...it is DELICIOUS!!  I try to refuse every time but I cannot.  I really enjoy the sangria.  The wine selection is great!  I just love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My stepdad had one request when he and my mom came to visit me from Minnesota- he needed good pizza. Done. My boyfriend and I told them we were walking to this great place down the road. (I live 8 blocks away) I could tell he was getting antsy by the 5th block but when we got there we put our name on the list and shopped in there grocery side! My parents loved it! They bought hand cream, candles, and I bought a cute card... Next came the dinner part: First of all my boyfriend and I can share a pizza together and be content, so my stepdad says, \"well, we'll need at least 3 then between the four of us!\" Holy chubby's! ;) We got the Gladiator, the men shared the mushroom and pepperoni, and the ladies shared the avocado. I don't think even a crumb was left by the time we were done!  Mom and I did decide that next time we'll get the avocado but we want spinach instead of the basil! Oh and be careful of the lemonade- delicious but sour! It's fresh they make it there!   I recommend any item on the menu- we have never had a poor experience with the food or staff! Thanks LGO! Oh, and my stepdad says he's still having dreams over how great the sour dough pizzas were!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza joint! Staff was friendly and the pie was delicious. It's hard to find a good vegan pizza because the cheese is hard to master. I tried the Dali lama vegan pizza with House made vegan cashew cheese and it was the shizz! I'm going back to try everything else sub cashew cheese because it was that good! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I went with a friend who has a baby boy and they were accommodating with a high chair even though we didn't ask for one.  The only reason this was not 5 stars was because we went on a Saturday at 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait 25 minutes before getting a table for 6.  Also, the parking was full, which added to the wait time.  There is a valet attendant, who was a bit helpful.  Now, onto the food!  We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh.  It came with a fair amount veggies (celery sticks and blueberries) as well.  We ordered the Mushroom Party w/ chicken sausage, Classic Margherita, and Mother Earth.  Mushroom Party was just okay.  I love mushrooms, but the flavors didn't grab my taste buds as the other two did.  Classic Margherita was my favorite.  The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat.  Hint: use the parmesan to enhance the cheese flavor even more.  The Mother Earth was also tasteful if you are a fan of broccoli and olives.  One of us had a cheese allergy, so we had this one without cheese and it still tasted great.  We shared the the Duvel Golden Ale growler which was much cheaper than each of us ordering an individual pint.  It was enough for about 5 and a half glasses.  So, 16 bucks vs 6 bucks a pint.  Which would you prefer?  Overall, great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try.  Service was attentive with drinks and boxes despite the large crowd and customers were not to rowdy or out of control.  This place works for both social or family outings."}
{"text":"Best place for a date night!! Grab a glass of wine and one of their fabulous pizzas and enjoy the great service and perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Parking sucks, waiting may be long, but the food is worth it. Never had an average or bad experience here. It's becoming our regular Sunday night digs."}
{"text":"The environment is super cute and quaint. It has a lot of character and looks like a fun place but the food we got was not very good. We ordered the breakfast hash, a turkey sandwich and a gf cookie. For us the food was tasteless. Perhaps if we would've got one of the pizzas we would enjoyed our experience more. The only reason I am giving them three stars is for staff and the environment."}
{"text":"Fallen angel and a pitcher of sangria... on the way out I get a sea salt chocolate chip cookie. This place is the best pizzeria in town. I've been to the fancier places and the price and quality of this pizza is superior in every way.  Go to Pizzeria Bianco and wait 2 hours for mediocre gourmet pizza? Or go here and eat amazing pizza right away.... hmm, tough choice eh?"}
{"text":"Just went back again, after not being there for longer than I'd care to admit. I went to my old faithful, the fallen angel with an egg. We decided to get some wings, which were AWESOME!!! Wifey got this super secret pizza that's not on the menu, but used to be her fave when it was. It's called the Padre. it's got Prosciutto, Arugula, Ricotta and fig. She ixnays the fig and subs the ricotta for bleu cheese (yes, I am shamed at being Italian and my wife not wanting ricotta on her pizza) I had a few Stella's, the by-the-glass wine menu is 2 whites and 2 reds, which blows. overall, we always love this place. We even snuck into the little grocery before we left and score some jumbo Tammie Coe cookies!!!!"}
{"text":"Somehow i have gone by whole entire life without going or even hearing much about of La Grande Orange Pizzeria. After always seeing great reviews on my Yelp home page I decided that i had to go and give it a shot!  None of us in our group had been there before so we had no idea what to expect. We all had a fantastic time at LGO! When we showed up we had to wait 20 minutes so we went next door to the grocery store, the time flew by while we where over there. With all the things to look at, it was the fastest 20 minutes of my life.  Our food was beyond delicious and our service was great! I cannot say anything bad! If you haven't been before you gotta go! I will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza place. I am a natural fan of pizza. I love the avocado pizza, the gladiator, and just plain old ham pizza from here. The staff is friendly and easygoing. Pizza is to die for from here! It is a nice relaxed atmosphere if you go during a weekday for dinner (plus you can find parking easily). If you go on Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait about 30-35 minutes for a table. The Sangria's are also very good here. Cannot wait to go back, awesome pizza."}
{"text":"This place has exceptional food and pretty great service for how busy it always is. I like it because there are quite a few vegetarian options.  Before I started my vegetarian kick the Baked wings were some of the best wings I have had anywhere.  Try: - Mushroom Party Pizza - Roasted Corn Pizza - Baked Wings - Red Velvet Cake  Only con is the parking is kinda crazy."}
{"text":"First and foremost LGO has wonderful service and a delicious roasted corn pizza, recently though they have changed their margarita (beverage not to be mistaken for the pizza). Typically it was made to order and it was the Best Margarita in town, instead they are now pre mixing the margarita's and sadly the quality is not the same."}
{"text":"My parents (and I, many times) have been ordering take out pizza from La Grande Orange Pizzeria almost every Friday for the past... maybe 10 years?   The food is always fantastic, my dad loves hanging out while waiting for it (I'm not sure how much they like it, but it seems like he makes buddies), and I literally cannot think of one time in years that they have ever disappointed me. Every time my mom gets bored and switches us to a new place, we always come back. No substitution for LGO.  Get what sounds good to you, and you will enjoy it. It's as simple as that. I've had everything on the menu and no complaints with anything. They don't have my favorite pizza anymore (RIP), I think it was called the Padre, but they've actually been nice enough to make it for me a few times. Our go to pizza is the Gladiator. The avocado with prosciutto is always great too. Their sausage is fantastic.  This review is short on specific details, I know. But if there was ever a review for you to listen to, it would be this one. La Grande Orange Pizzeria has been a part of my life since I was a teenager, and I hope they stick around forever.  (OK if I had to say ONE negative thing about LGO- they are very busy and parking is limited. I've only eaten inside a handful of times because we are more inclined to eat at home. The inside is beautiful but of course crowded and noisy when they are busy.)  I don't think Megan (sp?) still works there, but she was the best! My dad is a chatty old man and she handled him every Friday for years like a champ.   If anyone knows us... hi from Harry's daughter! We love LGO!"}
{"text":"Don't come here before 4:00 pm.  You get to wait on yourself and the menu is very limited. Oh and parking is valet..."}
{"text":"I had the chance to try this place this past Saturday for lunch.  A friend and I shared a tuna nicoise salad, mushroom pizza, and a salted chocolate chip cookie.  All were very tasty. However, I brought some macarons home for my husband and I and I was a bit disappointed with these.  They didn't taste bad, but the texture just wasn't quite right.  It was also pretty busy when we were there.  Although our food was ready quickly, the set up of where you order and where you pick up the food could be arranged a little better.  I found it to be somewhat disjointed and it was a bit confusing.  Because this place is also a little shop, there are a few small aisles of body care, jewelry, t-shirts, gourmet cheeses, etc.  There is a little bit of everything.  They also have a counter dedicated to only serving coffee type drinks and a room that features a bar.  It's a unique place, as there is a hodge podge of things going on, but it works.  I recommend checking it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"***** This place has always been AMAZING and close to my heart!!!  Everything from their food, the service and the ambiance!! It is always relaxing to come in to La Grande Orange both the grocery store and or pizzeria.  It has a very nice uniqueness to it as well as a very tasteful satisfaction.       As for our meal my boyfriend and I had their amazingly minty Cesar salad to start, then their exquisite ceviche and to end the MUST, The Rocket Man pizza!! lets not forget their fruity sangria!! VERY YUMMY!!! Oh and yes everything was GREAT!!! :)     Honestly, last night was my best visit so far, we got to sample their complimentary wine tasting and this to us was a perfect touch for our night!!!     La Grande Orange is simply as best as AZ gets, so experience it yourself and thank me later!!! :)"}
{"text":"best pizza in the country, hands down. commuter sandwich is also delicious. fun place, hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"The pizza is really great in flavor and variety. The breakfast pastries and goodies are also delish. Very nice service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Delicious salad, pizza, and wine. We got the Padre pizza which is not on the menu, but fig, prosciutto, arugula, and ricotta... so delicious!! The crust is perfect!   The best part is they have several BOTTLES of wine under $12. Yes, you could usually barely get a glass for that amount. Sold... ! We had the Four Vines ZIn that was amazing for only $10.99."}
{"text":"A friend took us here on a recent trip.  My pregnant wife really enjoyed the close proximity of the gellato stand being connected to the same building, and the attached market looked very interesting.  That being said, the parking situation is awful.  We went on a week night and only had to wait 5-10 minutes to get a table.  The service was \"interesting\" but not bad.  It didn't take long for the food to come out at all.  We ordered a Gladiator, which I slayed by myself, and a Roasted Corn for the ladies to enjoy.  The pizza won't blow your socks off, but it's good.  I would definitely consider eating here again on future trips."}
{"text":"It is somewhat confusing maneuvering your way to ordering, sitting down, and waiting for your food. However, everything tastes fresh and the trendy look of the place brings all sorts of people.  We have come here twice, once just for dessert, and the other, for lunch and dessert. Everything seems like it is made from scratch. For example, the cheeseburger was delicious with its homemade English muffin. The bakery has an assortment of goodies, but I haven't found that one item I would look forward to. I'll keep looking.  The parking is horrendous but the meal and ambiance is great! Whenever we are around this area, we will definitely have to check you out again!"}
{"text":"One of my first memories here was many years back when I was still a youngin. My brother,  Jared M. took me here for some dinner. We ordered a pizza and continued to play boggle and hang out..a memory I'll never forget.   So here are some of my favs;  pizza's always delicious but when you can breakfast all day, the commuter is my number one pick. Mixing the tea's is definitely a good move to make & they've e also got amazing pre-made salads for the ones who need something quick and on the go. Most recently i had  a delicious turkey sandwich & a burger with my roommate to share. Although they forgot the burger, the free cookies they let us eat after made it all worth the while.  Too bad I was too full to hit the gelato spot attached to the dining area but then again, there's always next time!!   Though parking is often a b***h you'll lose any sense of anger after walking inside their doors. The workers are friendly and the music sets tone for great times.   GO GO GO TO LGO even if your getting your food to go, they'll bring it straight to your car, uber convenient eh?"}
{"text":"I may be missing the point of this place, so I do plan on giving it another shot.  I came here with mom and sis recently on a beautiful Sat afternoon... I ordered mom a sandwich and I had their burger on their house english muffin... would have been a tasty combination if the patty meat hadn't been almost raw.  Mom's sandwich was good according to her, she ate it but certainly didn't talk about it like she's talked about other places I've taken her to eat.  I also ordered a latte in a for-here cup.  So the reason this wasn't a 4 stars for me: 1) I personally ordered 3 things and had to WAIT at 3 different stations for each thing.. very frustrating when your latte is ready and it's starting to get cold and your sandwich (mom's) comes out way earlier than your burger.. so now you're mom is eating because her sandwich will get cold, your coffee is getting cold at your table because you have to be standing up by the burger place to finally get your hot, yet kinda raw, burger.  Super frustrating and I think this was the key reason why I didn't enjoy my visit here...   The food was decent, but really was not that special enough to warrant the frustration of waiting at three different places for food (that arrive at totally different times) and then ultimately not enjoying the experience because of that.  I'll give it one more shot because my friends swear it's awesome... but I wish they operated more seamlessly."}
{"text":"Place was a little confusing for me at first. I entered through the pizzeria area and had no idea where to order. I had to bother someone to figure it out, other than that, this place was good pizza, I love how they used sourdough for our crust! Definitely worth a shot"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today after an exhaustive morning searching estate sales for vintage furniture. The girl and i split the tuna salad sandwich. I have no complaints on the sandwich. I like the big chunks of tuna, cucumbers, and fruit.  my girlfriend prefers untoasted bread, but other than that, she loved it, too. We ordered mimosas, but ended up with a pitcher of sangria instead. We werent in the mood for sangria, & the manager refunded it right away. She also offered us mimosas, but we declined since we were already done with our meal. Overall great experience, as always."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service!  My first time there the chef made our pizza wrong.  Despite that, the pizza was still pretty awesome and the waitress was even kind enough to give us the right version.  We ended up getting three pizzas for the price of two.  That was over and beyond my expectation.  Needless to say, we gave the waitress a generous gratuity and everybody left happy.  I have been there a few other times and and everytime has been a wonderful experience.  My only qualm is that there's not enough parking.  You need to get there super early or super late and even then parking can still be a challenge.  LOVE THE FOOD there and that's the most important thing!"}
{"text":"Stellar pizza. The good folk at La Grande Orange clearly know their stuff. The pizzas have well-thought out and executed topping combos. They use delightfully fresh toppings. And most of all, they've absolutely nailed the texture of their pizza: the crust stays perfectly crunchy (yet slightly soft inside) everywhere on the pizza, regardless of how many toppings you load on. Which, speaking of toppings, they allow you to add on extra garlic, onion, and even a fried egg with runny yolk for free--any pizza place that appreciates the magic of runny egg yolk and provides it for free is something special.   When I saw that they only offered a single variety of wing, I was somewhat nervous that it was an after thought--but I was dead wrong. Easily on par with their great pizza. Pleasantly spicy and ever so slightly sweet, their grilled wings are an excellent example of what hot wings are supposed to be.   Parking sucks, but oh well."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to try this place!  Everything on the menu is amazing!  Parking is challenging but worth it."}
{"text":"LGO Pizzeria is attached to the grocery.  You can walk over, find your favorite wine, enjoy it with dinner, and it's sold at the same price.  I miss pizza and wings, and was so happy to find out they offer gluten free options.  They also mark which items are vegetarian/vegas.  We can go there and get baked chicken wings with a classic margherita or the fallen angel pizza: housemade sausage, shaved fennel, roasted peppers, premium cheese & red sauce.  It''s dim, it's loud, it's not quick (it's super busy), so go when you have time and good company."}
{"text":"So, this place is great.  The pizza crust tastes like sourdough bread but ten times better, because its in a yummy thin pizza crust.  The gladiator pizza is very meaty and heavy and filling, but also kind of irresistable, with the HUGE pieces of schreiner's sausage and BIG pepperonis.    I have had about half of the pizza styles from here, and I have liked all of them (even goat cheese, which I used to think I would HATE!!)  If you try it once, I guarantee you would want to come back.  I like getting it to go, because I don't often feel comfortable enough pig out on pizza in front of people, and that's what happens with La Grande."}
{"text":"This pizza is some of the best that I've eaten in the US. A delicious stone fire baked pizza that has an absolutely delicious crust. It's thin and garlicky. The different pizzas have such fresh and flavorful ingredients and they top it off with freshly grated Parmesan! For our dinner we started with the guacamole & pimento cheese and chips platter. It was absolutely shocking of freakin' good it was. I don't even like pimento Cheese (not in the least) and there I was scarfing it down like no other. The guacamole was mad fresh too! We ordered the rocket man pizza and the Mother Earth--both phenomenal choices. All in all it was an beautifully delicious meal and would totally come back!"}
{"text":"My second-favorite pizza (close-second, mind you) in Phoenix.  Great atmosphere, always crowded, and always delicious pizza and salads.  I used to love their Pacifico pizza with shrimp, chorizo and goat cheese....mmmmmmm - but regrettably it's not on their menu anymore.  The sangria here is not bad either.  Very friendly and attentive hosts & servers, and casual yet fun decor."}
{"text":"Took forever for my girlfriend Abd I to get served. I had the trout dish. When it finally did arrive, It had no flavor and the texture was as if it was boiled, including slimy skin.  I sent it back and so as not to take too long opted fir the smoked salmon appetizer - nice effort but not much better than a top Costco brand.  Excellent marguerites though!!"}
{"text":"5/5 for food and 4/5 for service. A cute, unique place to take gluten-free friends, fans of fermented food, and lovers of authentic Italian grocery items (attached grocery store). The house gelato was amazing!  Food: We loved the fermented sourdough crusts - they were something a little bit different, and added a kick to our pizzas. I especially liked the way the sourdough paired with the Mother Earth. We got the Mother Earth (as mentioned) with cheese (not vegan), the Mushroom Party, and the Fallen Angel. All three were really good - the Mother Earth was my favorite, while my husband liked the Fallen Angel. The Mother Earth was full of vegetables that are usually hard to find on pizza, such as broccolini, and the Fallen Angel was amazing, if you like fennel. The Mushroom Party was really good, too - it just seemed more like something you could find on a regular pizza menu. For dessert, we had gelato, which was SO good. They let us go next door to the little attached grocery so we could sample all the different flavors. All were good, and we ended up going with prickly pear, Meyer lemon, cherry amaretto, and pistachio (in different cups!).  Service: Our server was friendly and saved our seats while we ventured to the grocery store. We had to wait fifteen to twenty minutes for our friends to arrive, and she didn't seem annoyed that we were taking up one of her tables (we didn't know that they'd be that long). She was very good about answering our questions, and pizzas didn't take too long to come out. It was a little squishy at the table, and it didn't really seem like there was enough room for all the food and for us."}
{"text":"There is to much to say about this place, not only do i usually try and go everyday for the commuter breakfast sand which but i sometimes find myself going here twice a day, they have an amazing staff everyone is very friendly and every item on the menu is amazing. They have the best wings I've ever had and i have been all around the world and nothing beats them. The atmosphere is amazing, i sometimes forget im in Arizona and i feel like im in California! I have nothing bad to say about this place, if i had to only eat at one place for the rest if my life, this would be it!"}
{"text":"This place exudes excellence across the board...I've been coming here for years and they're the epitome of quality and excellence!   Sourdough crust and high grade toppings make their pizza's absolutely phenomenal...My personal favorite is The Rocket Man! The slight zip of the Fresno Chilies put it over the top! The spicy pimento cheese they have is also a personal favorite!  I've really never had a cookie, gelato, salad, sandwich, pizza, etc, etc that wasn't exceptionally good.  Great Staff as well.  Go during non peak times for the most prompt service and lack of parking dilemmas!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM TO THE YYYY! Everything is sooooo good on the menu! I never like pizza except from another spot and the gladiator is by far the best and only thing I get now! Plus a side of fries! The menu is eclectic so something for everyone, and the gelato to die for! I love how it's a little boutique also so if your grabbing food to go you can shop around or looking for that last minute gift! Can't say enough about it! Fabulous"}
{"text":"Let me tell you what, LGO is my all time favorite. Here's why: the food is always delicious. But here are other reasons why: it's the perfect place to catch up with friends, make an office away from your office, or just sit alone with an overly pricey french decor magazine and drink a lemonade. Among my favorites: both tuna sandwiches, french pancakes, tuna Niçoise salad, cottage cheese, fresh juices, and roasted corn pizza. Oh and sometimes their music taste is so good you'll discover a new song you want to add to your playlist. It's also the perfect place to pick up a luxe candle or an adorable vase you suddenly can't live without."}
{"text":"Coming here on a Friday night will be a for sure wait of 30-45 minutes- with no reservations taken. Luckily their grocery next door is stocked with trinkets of all sorts (i.e. La grande orange t-shirts, phoenix t-shirts, 7 year pen, candles, soap, books and all kinds of goodies). If you're looking to pick up food, the grocery store has pre-made salads, gelato, desserts and to-go menu items available. There are cheeses and wines to purchase to go and at the table. If you're not into the browsing of items then there is an open bar area to grab a drink.   Within 30 minutes the hostess found me and said the table will be ready in a minute! Purchased a Pinot noir for the table of 5. Henry the waiter grabbed waters and lemon for us at the start. We did the family style and ordered 12 piece wings (which we were jipped by one lonely wing) and they were darn good with a bit of char; shrimp ceviche with chips; chopped salad with pepperoni; and roasted corn pizza.   Wings came out first with celery sticks and radish halves. Full of meat on those bones. Then the roasted corn pizza was next with sprinkled roasted corn and sliced tomatoes all over the pizza that was married to the cheese with floating leaves of basil. Ceviche was served in a goblet drink ware filled with chunks of shrimp, chopped onions and tomatoes topped with avocado pieces. Add a squeeze of lime to enhance the flavors.  Salad looked like for a serving for one. We were not quite full and went with another half order of wings and another roasted corn pizza. Done.   Not quite yet. Made room for dessert: mint choc chip scoop and salted caramel scoop of gelato. Yum!   Only part to not getting the full 5 stars was our waters were never filled. I drank my water to the last drop with not even an ice cube to melt. Overall, dining experience and food choices were a 4 star. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I probably eat here at least once a week if not more. They have something for every mood. Ceviche (TO DIE FOR!), burgers, salads, wings and the best pizza in town. I highly recommend a visit to LGO! Five stars every time. If it's busy, wait...its worth it."}
{"text":"I love LGO!!  I live down the street and I go there 3-4 times per week for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner or baked goods.  For dinner, I love the Roasted Corn Pizza and the Dip Trio (the Pimento Dip is addicting).  The atmosphere is great although not the best spot for a large group.  The retail side is an excellent spot to pick-up gifts: they have really cute and unique items.  I highly recommend La Grande!!"}
{"text":"If you do anything for yourself today, go to LGO Pizzeria and order the Fallen Angel pizza. I've enjoyed it on over 5 separate occasions, and each time is just as mouth/water/ingly delicious as than the last. Seriously, it means everything to me.   The vibe at LGO adds to the taste as well, though getting takeout goes swimmingly every time. Last time I was there, my favorite song by one of my favorite bands played in the relaxing, warm environment.   My only concern is that it is a little loud what with small children chattering and what not. I don't mind however. Just as long as I get my Fallen Angel Pizza forever. Always.   Tl; dr: The Fallen Angel pizza makes me question my faith in the most beautiful and tasty way."}
{"text":"You think Pizzeria Bianco is the best? This place is at least even or better and you don't have to wait 3 HOURS to be seated.   Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough! / Great Ceviche/  Perfect place to go with a group of friends or a date/ FREE VALET/ One of the best drinks ever \"SHAKIN' LEMONADE\"   This place should be Bookmarked!! TRY IT"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place as we are visiting here from Minneapolis.   Besides the great music and nice vibe, the food was amazing.   Both me and my bf are gluteen free and their gluten free crust was delicious. :-)"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.........I have been here a couple of times and it has never been a good experience, nor has the food been good.  I'm finished with this place. I know that LGO gets good reviews, but WHY?????  The parking lot is a cluster and the \"complimentary\" valet is a hassle. I wait on both ends.....dropping off the car, and getting the one person valet to retrieve my car. There goes 15 minutes out of my lunch hour. I wish they'd just let us self park.   Placing an order for food is equally frustrating as people are bumping into you and squeezing by you to get around a bunch of tables with overpriced gift items on them.  What the heck?  Get that junk out of there and make it a more pleasant experience for the customer!  There is even less elbow room where you go stand to pick up your order. Even the employees can't get through and do their jobs. They are carrying hot food and trying to jockey around the customers.  Such a no brainer!  Now to the food.......lunch portions are SKIMPY to say the least. A $9 pulled pork sandwich looks like a slider, and there are no sides with the sandwich. My $10 Hot Sammy sandwich was about an inch thick with barely any meat on it. Again, no sides come with the order.   Such a disappointing experience on all levels. SO many better places to go in that area!  SKIP THIS ONE!"}
{"text":"Bad news for me... I just moved within biking distance of LGO. Yeah, their food is healthy and all these vegetarian and vegan options, but... dang. I like different and tasty food, and they've got it nailed.  Corn on a pizza?  Heck yeah.  Get in there and experiment!  As others have noted, parking is a bit of a pain but their complimentary valet helps."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Gluten Free Pizza I've ever had! They always have a great beer, wine and cider selection and I love the casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Oh LGO. There's kinda no where else like this in Phoenix. Let me tell you what I love about you: Your overall vibe. Your everything cookie. Your brown rice bowl, OMG so good. Those damned cupcakes that look just like classic Hostess cupcakes. All the cute merchandise in front that makes me want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on overpriced crap I don't need. Don't love: The $6 teeny tiny cappuccino. The parking situation. Otherwise, keep it up."}
{"text":"I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.  Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.  We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.  Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"Classy place great food!  Love the pizza better than other things although the other food is great as well.  The pimento cheese and salsa and chips is delicious   Music can be a little loud, but other than that the ambiance is good.  The only downer is trying to get parking  They are getting better"}
{"text":"HOLY WOW this is the best place in Arizona for pizza hands down, and possibly the entire world. I moved to Vietnam for over a year and thought about eating this pizza again at least once a week. And yes, I've had Pizzeria Bianco (both locations ok!), Federal, Forno... The thing about LGO pizza is that the sourdough crust is untouchable. It cannot be surpassed! I always order the margherita because it is pure and delicious and perfect, and I don't share. I've had Rocketman as well, which is super tasty, and everyone I know loves Mushroom Party but I don't like mushrooms :-( They also happen to have delicious cocktails, gelato, an amazing sea salt cookie (with gelato!!!), great grilled artichokes, and the awesome grocery right next door!   Servers are nice, service is fast, and I like all the music posters. It can be loud sometimes but that's because people are having fun! The only tiny thing I would change is to just have it be a bit brighter inside so I can see my beautiful pizza more clearly. I love you, please never close or change your recipe."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times now and have always enjoyed the experience. Great food, friendly service, reasonable prices.... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I am familiar with La Grande Orange in Pasadena. However, I never had their pizzas until I visited this little shop in Phoenix. It was delicious and the novelty and combination of taste - AMAZING! Between the 3 of us, we ordered:  Mushroom pizza: Pretty good, lots of 'shrums for those who like mushrooms Corn and Avocado: Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese! I love goat cheese, tastes almost like cream cheese :) The Gladiator pizza: Pretty much an all meat pizza The Tomato and Basil: Yum  They even have vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat. It's a great late night snack. I don't usually eat the crust but they made it so well that I wasn't picky about it.   Oh, and we also ordered chicken wings - it was alright but I would say stick to the pizzas."}
{"text":"Always did, still do, and always will love this place.   The only hesitation is the space. it makes me claustrophobic when I go there for dinner.... People sit on top of each other at the restaurant and hopefully I have table by the exit door in case of fire while eating dinner there....  Parking is also a hassle but i guess that makes the place more special. I can deal  with the parking no problem, it is just the restaurant space and so many table close to each other."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, me and my mom split the vegan Dalia lama pizza and it was luscious!!"}
{"text":"The gladiator and avocado with proscuitto pizza was good, however overpriced in my opinion.  The red velvet cupcake was really good.  We returned and tried items from the grocery side.  The food was amazing.   La Grande Orange takes pride in making things right and I can appreciate that."}
{"text":"Adjacent to LGO Grocery, this pizzeria is a poppin' spot in Phoenix! Order at the counter and snag a table, then people-watch as your pie gets made. There's beer and wine available, and gelato next door for dessert.  Opted for the unusual with the Avocado Pizza, added proscuitto- a great brunch pizza and big enough to share! The crust was tasty and the toppings were generous. In a city with a surprisingly high number of noteworthy pizzerias, LGOP has inventive options at more affordable prices, with less wait and better ambiance."}
{"text":"Perfect place. Everything is exceptional. Customer service is stellar and effortless. I hope they never change a thing."}
{"text":"Best tuna melt you'll ever have. Pizza is fantastic and a change of pace with the sourdough crust."}
{"text":"My husband, toddler, and I went here for dinner and it was not an enjoyable experience. It seems very disorganized. We get there, used the valet, and go in the first entrance we see. It had a big \"Come In\" sign. When you open the door you walk through the kitchen, kinda awkward, but whatevs. We look at the menu.. I decide to order a salad and my husband picks a sandwich, Great! Go to order and find out that sandwiches are only served untill 5. Ok, no big deal, but why doesn't the menu say that? OK, he will have a salad too , except he wants to modify it a bit. Hmm the salads are pre-made so that's not happening. I order my salad and he will look over the menu while we sit down. We head over the the main seating area, only to be told we can not sit there because we ordered our food on the grocery side. It would have been great for somebody to tell us that! So we head to the grocery side to find seating. Well, the seating on the grocery side is minimal and it was not kid friendly. We decided to go ask for a refund for my untouched salad so that we could have dinner where we could sit comfortably. They redeemed themselves when we were told of picnic benches available to sit and offered to bring us a high chair. It kinda of bothered me that we were only offered a highchair AFTER asking for a refund. It's standard practice to offer a high chair for people with children. I orderd the Sanoma Garden Salad. It was ok, but nothing amazing and the portion was rather small.  My husband decided to get food elsewhere"}
{"text":"After waiting for a parking spot with no results, I found a remote spot in the nearby neighborhoods.  Boo.  The wait was waaaaaaay too long, but I had an enjoyable time checking out the grocery store next door.  Ok, so pizza, wine, etc.  - not too bad.   But here's where it went wrong.  My ditsy waitress charged my credit card three times for my entire table's bill.  Then the ditsy manager couldn't fix it.  So I was then charged for my meal.  Hoping things went well.  Instead, my debit card was charged four times.  So I called back a few days later and the other ditsy manager gave me the run around, and refused to refund my credit card for the mistakes she and the other sorority girl made.  I was told to wait it out. I called back later on that week for a second opinion and received the same hurried answer from another manager.  Three weeks later, it disappeared from my bank statement.  I believe that a restaurant should be service that compliments their food. The food was ok. but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Fantastic everything: pizza, beer, ambience, service. The burger is exceptional."}
{"text":"Atmospherorific. That is a new word I want spread around for LGO because it entails all I want out of a restaurant. Of course good food, jeez, let me get to that, but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned, this place hits the mark on many points.      Ok, so the food. Yum. I really like the Daybreaker that is an egg white omelet with turkey and their own tomato avocado salsa but the other day I ventured into \"normalcy\" and just had 2 eggs cooked \"my way\" and bacon which maybe I stand alone on this, but love it crispy and it was perfect. You can also get a bottle of wine and they'll open it for you, but overall, the place is kind of self serve which is fine because I can serve myself. Get your own napkins, water, coffee fixings, etc. Think I can handle that for a change.      LGO is the ideal complement to the next door Postino, especially if you're out for the day. LGO grocery for breakie/brunch then off to Postino for some $5 wines daydrinking extravaganza...they're like the Bert and Ernie of Campbell & 40th street. Or maybe a better reference would be Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel seeing the one is better during the day and one is better during the night.       Ah, references shmereferences. LGO kicks ass :)"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite place. Why? They have EVERYTHING!   They have a beverage bar where you can order coffee, tea, soda, etc. They sell all different kinds of food from crepes, to eggs, to burgers, to salads, to pizzas, etc. To top it off, they also have a large selection of desserts! They have gelato and a TON of pastries. YUM! You can also shop around while you're waiting for your food.  If you haven't been to LGO, get your tooshie there!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange - LGO   I haven't been to LGO in about five years. After finally returning to Arizona of course we had to go to LGO. Known for their pizza of course I got a veggie pizza, made vegan.  They have a huge selection of vegetarian pizzas including vegan pizzas with vegan cheese!!!!!!!!!! Yes you read that right vegan cheese, and it is super tasty vegan cheese.   The have a happy hour cocktail menu that is a super great deal, 5 bucks a drink, from 4-6 PM I believe it is.   For  starters we had the chips with guacamole and pimento cheese, I didn't have the cheese dip because it wasn't vegan. But it did try the salsas that came with the appetizer and they all were loaded with flavor! The chips were super crunchy which was a plus.   I ordered the Mother Earth with no cheese (making it vegan) and it was wonderful! It was packed with a huge amount of veggies! I would have wished it would have been recommended to put vegan cheese on it because that would have made it even better.   The service was great and as always it was really busy. We got there just in time to avoid waiting long but weren't able to park in the front because all the spots were taken. However they have plenty of parking spots in the rear of the store with valet parking.   I highly recommend you walk through the LGO Grocery store connected to the restaurant. There are a lot of unique gifts, home goods, a to go deli to order from, and dessert!!! See some of the snaps I took below.   And guess what?! There are vegan desserts. They had a vegan apple cookie, which I had to try, and I was mind blown by how moist the cookie was. It also wasn't too sweet which made me happy."}
{"text":"Is there anything that the LGO Hospitality Group touches that isn't fabulous? I have yet to find it.  I am embarrassed to say that last night was the first time I have been to the Pizzeria. Between lunch and dinner, I frequent the LGO market at least two or three times a week; and I know most of the crew at Postino - yet, I've never ventured into their world of pizza. That is, until last night.  We arrived around 5:45 and ordered a glass of the Rosso and Sangiovese and mulled over the menu. Because we weren't too terribly hungry we debated between the Gladiator and the Roasted Corn Pizza. When our server, Chris, overheard us, he told us they would gladly do half and half so that we can taste both. I was thrilled. When the pizzas came out they were great. The Gladiator is your more traditional style pizza and the Roasted Corn had such an refreshing unique merriment of flavors.   We finished by sharing a piece of the Red Velvet Cake. Seriously? I could have had another piece all by myself. Its six or seven thin layers of cake, moist and delicious, separated by an addicting cream cheese frosting that I kept looking for more of.   As we were getting ready to leave; I was admiring the pies that were on the table next to us. I was offered a piece of the Avocado Pizza. I never would have ordered it, and at first I declined, but she insisted, I was curious and I caved. Again, it was pretty good. Not sure I would eat a whole Avocado Pizza - but I loved the taster.  Rumor has it that the wings are pretty good...I have no reason to doubt that its true. Don't wait as long as I did to try LGO after dark."}
{"text":"Place is great! I love the fact that the place is laid back yet the food is still of high quality. Pizza is very good, the green chile burger is awesome, and the service is always good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have to laugh at the suggestion that this restaurant is a pizzeria. It is much, much more than that. It is a fabulous gathering place of European design for locals dining with friends, or as in our case out of town visitors dining with local friends. It is bustling, if not somewhat crowded, but no one seems to mind. People are quite friendly as they stand in line to order, wait for their food to be placed on the pass to take to their own table, or pour their own coffee.   We entered through the backdoor, which actually leads you right through the kitchen. It's a bit of a fun adventure for someone who enjoys cooking, and restaurant ways, as I do. Once inside the restaurant is divided into two main rooms. One where you order most entrees, desserts, and coffee drinks, and the other containing the pizzeria.   I was disappointed to get to the front of the line to learn that they were out of my first choice, chilaquiles, but quite happy after tasting my croque madame. The ham was very tasty. And to think that I was actually considering giving up pork at one time. My lady's French crepes were delicious. She must have thought so also because I believe that she only offered me one bite. Shame, shame!   Although I didn't try it, the pizza looked fabulous. They looked a lot like the homemade pizzas that I have been making, but better of course. Next time I will definitely go for a pizza.   The peanut butter chocolate pie that we shared was just alright, but many of the other desserts looked tasty. However, if you only have limited capacity, I would suggest that you pass on dessert and get one of their homemade English muffins instead. The best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal, great service and yummy!  Retail, wine shop, bakery, piazza, sandwiches and lots of tasty wine and beers."}
{"text":"We tried a few sandwiches and both of those were great, but the gelato really stole the show on this holiday. The peanut butter chocolate chip had huge depth of flavor and the largest chips I have witnessed ever lurking throughout the dessert. The mango flavor also was intense as gelato allows a more pure taste experience. The BBQ chicken sandwich at $8.75 was packed with chicken breast (with skin) and cole slaw, but the flimsy hamburger bun was not a worthy piece of bread for this sandwich (perhaps a hero?). It must have been the holiday because I got a parking spot right away. See you next New Year's day."}
{"text":"Best Meal I've ever had! The wings and pizza were straight perfection. This is better than a fine dining experience. Food quality was out of this world. Ryan was the waiter of the year. Couldn't have been any nicer!"}
{"text":"Wow, this has to be the best place for breakfast in the Scottsdale area! We went back 2x's. The café is awesome, the food for breakfast fantastic with lots of healthy options. The avocados and eggs are A+. Coffee is wonderful. Will go back for sure A+!"}
{"text":"Lemon zest?  On a pizza?    Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience.  And that they did!  My final verdict; the Avocado Pizza is heavenly!  The creamy avocado, sweet tomatoes, summery basil, bright lemon zest, and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza.  The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go.   The even better part is the sourdough crust!!  So delicious!  All of their pizza creations sound amazing.  I can't wait to try them all!  A few more tries and I easily see a fifth star in their future.  It did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place.   - Order your food on the grocery side,  - find your own table on the pizzeria side,  - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side, - listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side, - ask for more ice at the coffee stand, - fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two - go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case (trust me, you do not want to skip this step!)  In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends, LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite (hard-to-find) red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's.  Score!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I've traveled the United States eating pizza.... Washington, Phoenix, New York City, Vegas.... and I constantly find myself comparing everyone else's pizza to LGO's. I have not found a pizza better than the Roasted Corn pizza. It is just fantastic! This is my FAVORITE PIZZA in all the land!! :) The Gladiator isn't half bad either, very delicious. You win LGO!"}
{"text":"Went today on a cold and rainy afternoon. I could've stayed much longer just hanging out people watching! Tried the commuter with bacon and pulled pork bbq sandwich. Commuter was awesome as always.. Bacon was nice and crispy! Had to have that with a Havana latte! The BBQ sandwich was just ok, nothing special IMO. Will have to get a pizza next time and hang out longer! Parking and finding a table wasnt too bad today. Maybe cuz of the weather..  Quick tip: sign up for their email club and you can get $5 off your visit to both LGO or nearby Chelseas kitchen. They even send you $10 off for your birthday!!"}
{"text":"Lgo..lgo..l...g..ooooooooo!! This place is always amazing. The pizza is always great...amazing burgers and salads as well.  the grocery store is attached next door and is a great place to pick up your favorite drink, Tammie coe cupcake, or small gift. Also a great breakfast! One of the easiest 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The above statement comes easily and without any sort of hesitation.  Their pizzas are phenomenal, the appetizers are great, the wait staff is very helpful, and the ambiance is great.  After looking at my budget, I noticed that my only expense for the last two months in my restaurants category is LGO.  Seriously, go there, order the artichoke appetizer, iced tea, a margarita pizza, and gelato to finish it off. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Line is obnoxiously long.  I mean the food al looked good and everything, I ordered the french pancakes.  I sat outside on the patio in front.  Nice atmosphere in arcadia area.  Lots of hip people hanging out here."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go for a sour dough pizza crust.   Very crispy, light and flavorful pizza.  I also liked that you could go to the adjoining grocery store, buy a nice bottle of wine and they open it with NO corking fee.   Megan was our server and she was very pleasant and sincere.   The only complaint was the music was very loud even after they turned it down.  It made it hard to visit with the rest of our table."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere!  The pizza, baked goods and coffee are top-notch.  Parking is a little tough, but they have free valet and extra parking next door."}
{"text":"Just love this place - great food and drinks, plus fun shopping to do while you wait for your food. It's a must every time we visit PHX!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza comes from LGO's kitchen: the roasted corn pizza with goat cheese. The sourdough crust is always perfect. Also, excellent salads, fries and desserts.  Service is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place did not live up to the expectations created by so many other people. My visit started with my girlfriend and I not even being greeted/served water until 10 minutes had passed. After we finally had the opportunity to order our appetizer(chips and guac), we waited almost half an hour with out anyone assisting us or bringing us the extremely simple appetizer. Even after all the absurd waiting, my girlfriend and I decided to stick it out and order a pizza(fallen angel). I think you can guess what happened next. Our pizza took more than half an hour to come out and by that time it was pretty much cold. I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience here and would not recommend it to anyone as I would not want to put them through such a miserable time."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of LGO. The food is fabulous and the grocery is so eccentric with awesome finds. Parking is a bit difficult, but during prime time they have free valet. Their tea is delicious, and you can't go wrong with any pastry or dessert. I love their English muffins and recommend the commuter. There are great vegetarian options on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Just can't get over how insanely good the vegan Dalai Lama pizza is!!! From the crust, to the cashew cheese, to the veggie toppings. Who could have guessed Brussels sprouts on a pizza would be divine? La Grande Orange!   Add a pitcher of Mosaic IPA for only $15 and send me to heaven."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the amazing spot since it's right across the street from my home for years. Have loved all the employees and the food. Tonight.... Not so much. Kelsie on the bakery side has the be the most rude individual I've ever ordered from. I'm trying to stay positive and hoping maybe she something occurred prior to me calling and arriving that made her so angry at life. Her customer service skills....hard fail. Everyone else keep doing your thing, you're the reason I come back I hate singling out individuals. But a bad experience is a bad experience. Food and all other folks 5+ stars. The individual I mentioned, hard zero  I really hope it was a one night occurrence and the attitude improves tomorrow."}
{"text":"Well finally! Just over a year ago Gabi invited me to lunch at LGO, then we switched and went somewhere else and that is the last time I have been on the verge of going there. Not that EVERYONE didn't recommend it. When people hear where I live they assume I'm making daily trips to LGO, which I now know, I should have been!   Dottsy and I hit up LGO on Wednesday night, meeting at 7:30. Of course the place was packed, not to mention the absurd parking lot (thank god I rode my bike!), but the LGO gods smiled on me and I found two seats at the chef's table almost immediately. I took in the menu as I waited for Dottsy (late as always, but I forgive you), though honestly there's not a lot to take in as the options are few and very straightforward. Then I stared at other people's food and got really excited. So excited that it took me forever to figure out what I wanted to eat (Shrimp Ceviche, Pizzeria Chop Salad, Mushroom Party Pizza or Veg-o-rama pizza were the final four).   Dottsy bought us some time by telling the server he was both 'GORGEOUS!' and had 'BEAUTIFUL EYES.' Way to take one for the team Dottsy. I went for the Pizzeria Chop Salad and the Butternut Squash Soup to start.  My soup was decent, but really, I need to stop ordering things I make really well at home because I'm never wowed. Anyway, the salad was yummy and I'd asked for no raisins and our server even came by to make sure it was raisin-free (it was, and btw he really was beautiful).  Dottsy's pizza looked great and I got to sample a slice and immediately wanted a whole pie to myself.   I guess it's all the more reason to head back to LGO and work through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza was to die for. Sourdough crust was perfect, and pizza was made relatively quick for what it was. Got an Italian soda, not sure it was worth almost $4, but it kind of went with the gourmet territory. The little store was cute, the merchandise was expensive, but like I said, goes with the territory. Had a brownie that was very rich and delicious. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Campbell and 40th is my favorite food intersection in Phoenix so far.   The food itself is probably worth 4 stars but I'm going to bump it up for Courtney, our server who was great. Prompt, efficient, friendly.  This place is actually very reasonably priced if you order the right things.  Each pizza is enough to share (as stated on the menu) but we were ambitious and ordered more than enough. Thus, it allowed for us to sample different kinds and take some home which I'm def not complaining about.  The tap beer prices are also a great deal if you order the growler and split among friends. I'll probably buy the jug next time, which you can bring back and get even more discounts on a refill.  Pizzas had a great crust, like a thin crunchy asiago flatbread. Don't forget to add the freebies like onion, garlic, egg, chiles, and extra love. Very good. Friends had gelato and a red velvet cupcake that they said were enjoyable.  Atmosphere is spot on for a joint in Arcadia. Server correctly split our bill without hassle.   Pizza, beer, fun. I'm going to find a fat, lazy day where I just go back and forth between Postino and LGO."}
{"text":"You need to know that parking really does suck here.  Yes, it sucks that much that it's the first thing that needs to be put in the review.  Go there aware of this, and you can still have a great time.  LGO is a pretty cool place that I suspect came out of nowhere and has since flooded the little corner it sits on.  It wholly deserves the attention, mind you, as that whole tiny plaza is awesome (this does consist of a gelato shop, LGO Pizza, and LGO Grocery).  The first stop on the trip was to LGO Pizzeria.  The place was packed even late into the dinner hour.  It was a Saturday, so this wasn't really shocking.  Luckily, we were able to sit at the long communal immediately.  This also meant we go to look right at all the delicious looking pizzas coming out of the oven.  Needless to say, we felt real hungry, real fast.  Wine was chosen from the enormous tome of options (they sell wine at retail from the LGO grocery next door) and a few wings ordered.  The wings that arrived were very, very, very good.  I'm not even a huge fan of wings and these were just spectacular.  Baked and quite probably marinated for hours, they just fell right off the bone.  The pizzas, when they arrived, looked as good as everything else that had passed up by.  The Avocado pizza was an interesting blend of light cheese, avocado, and lemon zest.  While the lemon balanced the avocado out well, it wasn't quite to my taste.  The Rocket Man, on the other hand, was good and spicy.  Actually, the two pizzas were both very complementary to one another and the experience of the meal definitely benefited from it."}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend were going on a date night to Postino for their $20 bottle if wine a bruchetta deal. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to go have a drink at LGO while we waited.  We sat at the Chefs table and were greeted by our server Emma, I must say Emma was the nicest server. We asked her a ton of questions about what her favorite dishes were for when we come back. She was so helpful.  We ordered a bottle of wine, its a much better deal than a glass. They sell wine in their shop next door. You buy the bottle at retail price and there is no corking fee. We got a bottle for $13!! You cannot beat that.  After chatting with Emma for a while and seeing the food around us we ended up taking our name off the list at Postino. (we still love you Postino the wait was just too long).  Emma recommended the Padres pizza which is not on the menu. It was delicious. No sauce, four cheese blend, prosciutto, and fig! The salty/ sweet combo is great!!  We started with the Shrimp Ceviche and it was the best I have had!! The shrimp was plump and not sparse in the dish.  LGO had a warm, cozy environment that is inviting. Emma was fantastic! The food was yuuummyy!! We cant wait to go back and try a different kind of pie!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I haven't liked. The pizza and salads are amazing, the pastries are ALWAYS on point, and (being as obsessed with iced tea as I am) they have my favorite iced tea of anywhere else in the valley. Bonus is that their store area has some adorable gifts- I've definitely used them in a pinch if I forget to get a quick gift for a gal pal. I'm 8 months pregnant currently, and their snickerdoodle cookies have been the only thing I've craved so far. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Impeccable! I absolutely love this place, from the great music, to the delicious pizza, to the incredible burgers, and to the outstanding fries. The service was excellent, and the drink/beer/wine selection was quite impressive as well. Le Grande Orange is a true desert gem!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza has to be among the most perfect foods in all the world.  Really good pizza would likely be on my last meal request list.  Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza.  We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.  Bless her.  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:self  The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours. So it goes.  The pizza is worth the parking hassle.  We're on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our \"go\" list again. The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time."}
{"text":"As a break from studying for one of those standardized tests with a three or four letter abbreviation for a name, I decided to order a pizza for take away from La Grande Orange. After perusing the restaurant's simple and easy to navigate Web site, I decided on a margherita pizza with sausage. Upon ordering, I declined the what I will describe as \"carhop service.\" Why should I perpetuate the social alienation that automobiles and the urban design of Phoenix promote by taking advantage of such a service (and likely having to tip for it)?  Thirty minutes later, I arrived at the miniature stripmall. I'm sure many a yuppie have become enraged upon having their oversized SUV dented in the restaurant/grocer's small parking lot. I felt out of place in my 1999 Toyota Corolla (even with it being the \"luxury edition\"). I pondered if only individuals with a carbon footprint the size of Godzilla eat at La Grande Orange. I also wondered how pleasant it was for those \"dining in\" to sit with a view of SUVs and suburban sprawl in a building of little architectural merit.  First entering through the \"restaurant\" portion of the grocery, I stood for nearly five minutes with a look of confusion on my face as I watched high school-aged girls construct pizza boxes. I was assuming one of them would welcome me and ask me why I was here and how they could help me. That did not happen and I had to ask where I should pick up my pizza of my own initiative. I was directed to the nearby \"grocery,\" which was full of equal parts delicious looking breads and Halloween crap. In the \"grocery,\" I stood for another five minutes in one of three lines before I was finally directed to the right place to request my pizza. The girl I paid with was definitely unfriendly and borderline rude. Upon discovering she had no pen for me to sign my credit card slip, she went to retrieve one and then thrust it towards me with a \"Here!\" At this point, my frustration with the unfriendly staff combined with the realization that I had just paid more for my pizza at La Grande Orange (over $17) than I would have paid for a similar pie at Pizzeria Bianco to generate intense displeasure with the whole operation.  While I enjoyed my pizza and its unique sourdough crust upon consuming it at home (the ingredients were very fresh and I think I would like to try their avocado or roasted corn pies in the future), my general distaste for everything else about La Grande Orange (from price to staff to fellow patrons) will probably keep me from returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Followed a recommendation to this place during a recent business trip. The restaurant was great and the service was prompt. The salad and pizza that I ordered were delicious. After my meal I went next door to the grocery and ordered the same salad to go for my flight the next day."}
{"text":"One of the best best best best best pizza/salad/etc restaurants in Phoenix. Once you bite the pizza, you will immediately feel \"Oh my god, I am being healthy\"  This place satisfies not only your food cravings, but also your needs for health.   When you order the pizza, you can order two flavors, half and half. You should try the presciutto pizza for sure.   Not like other restaurants, i am feeling less guilty after having so many food here :)  So, weight watchers, here's the place you should try."}
{"text":"FRONT PARKING LOT IS LIMITED AND TIGHT !! BAD IDEA WHO EVER DESIGNED IT   **Pizza had good flavor but portions are small they are all around $15  **Wings were excellent they are Grilled $13 for dozen. **Happy Hour drinks are $5  ** The grocery store next door has good desserts, salads, sushi, to go orders(same menu as restaurant ) & gelato"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, love this place. Coffee in the morning, happy hour, dinner, whatever. I have been here several times and each time it does not disappoint. Leggo to LGO!"}
{"text":"i have been here multiple times for their pizza. their crust is to die for! it is made with sourdough and just so fucking good! some of the pizzas could use a little more toppings tho, but for the most part i am satisfied eating here. their pizzas are good for two people to share, or at times when i came really hungry and ordered a pizza with not as many ingredients, i could finish one. im sure an average guy could come here and consume a whole one to himself. service here is hit or miss. most of the servers dont come back around very often once your pizza is delivered. ive had to flag servers down here a few times. but it is nice sometimes because when i dont want to be bothered like when i am on my laptop, i get the solitude i want with the pizza that i crave. oh yea! that is another great thing here, they have wifi! a pizza place with wifi!! i know! exciting! also their kale salad is pretty decent here. it is on the sweeter side if you like that. It's a fruity kale salad."}
{"text":"This is HANDS-DOWN the BEST margherita pizza I've ever had.  While I was eating it the first time, I actually could not believe how delicious it was.  If you go for nothing else, go for this pizza."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out, trendy, vibey etc.  Parking can be tough, place is pretty packed, there is also a little store and wine and cheese etc.  Definitely worth a visit.  Would not make a habit of coming here though.  I know alot of people would disagree, just my two cents."}
{"text":"I've been in but it has been about 4 years and found the pizza yummy so thought I'd make another visit while in the area this past Saturday. The parking is always horrible and difficult to find a spot from my last memory and it has not changed. You order from the counter and if are in the wrong line the girl behind the counter will rudely tell you so. While the gift shop is full of adorable stuff it's over priced \"stuff\". A 1/2 dozen English muffins is $9.00. Really???  Salad comes in a plastic container and cost $9+. Unorganized and loud just plain uncomfortable so we left and went to the Parlor just 10 minutes down the road. Very glad we did as the food, atmosphere, and service was exceptional. Removed La Grande from my Instagram page."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for both breakfast and dinner! Make sure to check out the goodies in the grocery store next door."}
{"text":"Got this place for takeout, I've never dined in but the pick up side of the restaurant is pretty cool. They have a large selection of wine and other things.   I got the Gladiator pizza, added with free garlic and Fresno chilies! this pizza will leave you chanting, \"MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS! MAXIMUS!\" After you eat it! It was delicious. I wish they had a thick crust pizza because that's my thing!   The interior is nice and I think this could be a good second or third date locale to grab a pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & hip location/people/decor.  They have this salad with raw salmon that's basically sushi as a salad, and I've been craving it since I was last there."}
{"text":"I find LGO to be a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of place, so I will give a review with equal parts duality. In the end though, I'm going to go against the overwhelming positive grain and give it two stars for reasons below.   The Food  Mr. Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants. There's the breakfast/brunch servings and then there's the alternate menu, which consists of salads and their eponymous pizzas. For what it's worth, I've been here many times, more than I cared to, but my girlfriend used to live within walking distance, so it was too convenient to counter with any convincing argument against going. Of the many visits for breakfast, I've just felt underwhelmed by the food. The egg dishes, crepes, etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department. For what it's worth, they're going for a French flare to the cuisine, but it still always seems to under deliver.   Dr. Jekyll Says - On the contrary, the non-breakfast foods are quite good. The salads and the pizzas are really good, freshly made and what you would expect from an \"artisanal\" pizza place. Additionally, they have a solid beer and wine list.   The Brick And Mortar  Mr. Hyde Says - This place, specifically during the breakfast hours, is a disaster and would make any Retail Operations manager cringe at the lack of flow before them. You line up at one station to order food and pay. You line up at another station to order coffee and pay. There's no table service. You have to order your food, all the while, scout for the random table opening, while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold. And, to top it off, this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market, full of curios that other people call junk. Mr. Hyde believes that this market only adds to the utter chaos and lack of flow for the restaurant. It would be different if it was off to the side, but smack in the middle of everything yields chaos.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Avoid breakfast and go for dinner, where you can have great salads, pizzas and actually be seated at a table by a hostess and served by a waiter. What a revelation. The dinner area is actually in a different room and you can avoid the really cute market.  The Getting There  Mr. Hyde Says - The parking, or rather lack there of, is a huge negative. There is minimal parking on premises, minimal parking across the street, with most of the neighboring businesses posting signs, threatening to tow you.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Let's call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove \"convenient\" if you live nearby and can walk, avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there.   Summary In the end, it's really four stars for the pizza, two for the breakfast foods, but they get dinged an extra star for the headache that is parking.   Many Phoenicians love this place. I (we) think you can do better elsewhere.   Author's Note: My girlfriend has now moved from this neighborhood, so any argument in her favor for a visit based on proximity is now moot. Mr. Hyde has cracked a menacing smile."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood staple! I love going in for breakfast or lunch! The food is always excellent, the environment, fun, and the service, exceptional!  Their new rotisserie options are a welcome addition to the menu! I love the BBQ chicken sandwich, no bun!!"}
{"text":"Amazing crust, but it was very loud and service was a little slow, due to business. Very good experience overall"}
{"text":"With so many delicious pizza joints to choose from in Phoenix, it is difficult to pick a favorite! The pizza at LGO is BY FAR one of the best in town! I highly recommend the Mother Earth ...(if you're feeling daring, add goat cheese!) Another favorite is the Roasted Corn Pizza, add some of their housemade sausage!! Ohh and did I mention their insanely perfect pimento dip?!? It rocks my world every time! (Uhg, I'm even guilty of ordering just an order of the dip to go! I blame it on the fact that we're neighbors and it's too easily accessible.) This place is on the top of our 'favorites' list and I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everything in the menu is delicious. Priced reasonably, and they also provide great service."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Quality food, weather packaged or made to order. Drinks are great. Love that there are vegan or gluten free bakery items. Love the shop area where I always have to buy something. *Negative is the line procedure they have. it needs to be obvious of where the line is and where pick up is. Also well, not happy about now Grateful Spoon sharing the same line.....lame.  Still going this place is always a treat."}
{"text":"I must say I have drove by this place numerous times but have always been a little deterred to go in.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect since the parking was so small, the signs of where the actual restaurant was, wasn't that clear to me but after talking with a friend I was convinced I had to try this place. The parking was a bit confusing the lot in front is only for the market so if you are planning on dining in you can't park there. They share the valet services with Postino's which is directly behind their building (They will validate the ticket so valet is free). Walking up to the building I entered through what I am pretty sure was the La Grande Orange Market then through a skinny walkway entered the actual Pizzeria which was much bigger than I had expected. Our waiter was very friendly, he made sure we were aware of the specials and answered any questions we had. I ordered the Classic Margherita Pizza which was made with their signature sourdough crust that was so tasty, the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes gave it such great flavor. My friend ordered the Mother Earth Pizza that was full of fresh vegetables and just the right amount of cheese. For dessert we had the LGO old timer it looked like a giant homemade ding dong and while it was very rich, it was oh so yummy.... Overall I will definitely be back I loved the people, the food and the charm!!!"}
{"text":"Trying to find parking is futile, so you might as well opt for the \"complimentary\" valet. If you land in the back, please know it is A-okay to walk right through the kitchen. While there are a number of great salads, my favorite items are the desserts. I don't think I am exaggerating to proclaim that their red velvet cake by the slice is by far the best piece of sweetness you will ever find in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"I love LGO so much! Quality ingredients and products. I can always find a thoughtful card  or gift along with tons of appetizing foods and tasty drinks. They've got everything. The downside to LGO is the crowds, confusion where to order during in-between meal hours, and and limited parking. They've accommodated special parking spots for \"to go\", \"20 minutes only\" etc that make it better but valet often is the way to go. Valet is available in back. Very friendly staff. If it's not officially dinner hour there's no table service and you order & pick-up at market. If you're new you might not realize and become frustrated. As often as I've been there I still get confused. Wish they'd revise. Otherwise it's a must see in Arcadia! Kid & Dog friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Someone tell me where to find pizza in LA that tastes like LGO's!! Please??   I have been gone almost a year, and I am still craving the avocado pizza...."}
{"text":"Pizza and sangria are great. Unfortunately, Breakfast is only okay. Packed in the morning. Lunes move quickly. Good coffee.  Next to my favorite Postinos!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Their pizza is very unique and delicious.  Great rotisserie chicken and more.  Gelato and baked goods as well, a bit over priced but worth it."}
{"text":"So I finally went there for dinner. Their pizza is amazing!!! We had 3 different types and all were stunning especially the roasted corn! The crust is out of this world. They also have a great sangria which i had a few too many of.....oops o:).  If you are going to go at night with more then 2 people, I would suggest making reservations and they do have avalet but you can usually find a spot on the north side of Campbell and 40th st.  If you live in the Valley this is a definate MUST!!!!"}
{"text":"I love La Grande Orange. I've been dining here ever since my friend became head baker back in the day. First of all, this area in the Arcadia district is loaded with some of the best eats in the Valley. Postinos had a long wait, so we hopped over and hit the bar area at LGO. I've actually never been in this part of the restaurant. It's small and intimate and wasn't overcrowded. My buddy and I had a great time hanging out here. We didn't order any food this time, but did order a few drinks. Our bartender Nicole really made our night. She was inviting, gave us some drink suggestions and was just a joy to have conversation with. I felt I found a new late evening option next time I'm in the area. This shows that great customer service goes a long way! My only gripe is parking is always a pain. Happy Hour is 4-6pm on weekdays and 12-6pm on weekends."}
{"text":"LGO Hospitality deserves a great deal of credit for making the Arcadia neighborhood a foodie destination.  Upward Projects and Fox Restaurants get some props for that too, but LGO thus far has kept its AZ operations restricted to just the Arcadia neighborhood, giving the area a number of popular restaurants they can call their own (LGO Grocery, Ingo's, Buck & Rider, and Chelsea's Kitchen).  My experiences with LGO's restaurants haven't been perfect, but I really don't have many negative things to say about their food.  LGO Grocery in particular has a tremendous assortment of goodies for breakfast and lunch as well as a great variety of baked goods on hand.  Parking is atrocious and the snaking lines inside can be quite a nuisance, but the end result makes it worth the trouble as I can attest to from numerous breakfast outings here.  Having not yet tried the pizza menu before, I figured a mid-afternoon trip on Sunday would help avoid the long lines in the parking lot and inside (and it did).  So let's review.  I mistakenly thought that the pizzeria was its own separate operation such that I could grab a seat and I'd be helped by wait staff.  After a few minutes of seeing no wait staff, it became clear that ordering pizza here is just like ordering other items.  Wait in those snaking lines in the grocery area.  Fortunately the mid-afternoon lines weren't too bad (less than a 5 minute wait in line).   By the time I'd reached the register, I knew what to do.  A half and half pizza (because if you don't have to, why choose just one option?).  On one half of my pie, the Avocado pizza.  On the other half, the Fallen Angel pizza.  Total cost including tax came to $17.  Just as with LGO Grocery, go grab a seat in the main dining room and wait for someone to yell out your order at the prep area.  With about 7 minutes, the pizza chef yelled my name up front.  The Avocado pizza is a relatively simple recipe consisting of avocado, tomatoes, lemon zest, basil and cheese.  The Fallen Angel is a little more complex with housemade sausage, fennel, roasted peppers, cheese and tomato sauce.  The pizza is 12\" just as most similar neapolitan style pizzerias do it (Pomo, Cibo, etc.), but here its made in a conventional oven rather than a wood fired one.  Despite that fact, the crust on LGO's pizza is dynamite.  Much crispier than most thin crust pies I've had, but still soft enough on the inside to give it the perfect texture.  Both sides of my pizza were pretty solid.  The Fallen Angel half was my favorite of the two thanks largely to the more complex flavor profile (I was particularly impressed with the peppers), but the Avocado was still a good clean pizza that any vegetarian would enjoy.  Thanks to the mid-afternoon timing, I was in and out within 30 minutes no problem.  During prime time though, you'll wanna reserve some extra time for the lines inside and out.  I was quite pleased overall with the pizza I had and can understand the draw of this place for dinner.  I still wish parking was more ample and that they could reorganize the grocery store to make the lines more manageable (or better yet, hire a wait staff), but the food pretty much speaks to why people endure these inconveniences.  Arcadia foodie pride is understandably high thanks to this busy corner of 40th Street & Campbell.  With all the success this place has had, I'm pretty sure we'll be seeing many more new concepts from LGO Hospitality before long."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the last time, but the LGO staff ensured me that they would talk to their staff so they are no longer rude. I've changed my mind about their staff, and feel much better about the place as a whole. I throughly enjoy their pizza and I would definitely recommend it, especially after their action to resolve my previous irritated feeling toward them."}
{"text":"I just realized that I completely forgot to write my review on this place.  A bit odd to forget to write a review on a pizza place when I'm driving around town trying all the pizza places, no?  Perhaps it's because their pizza was completely forgettable.  We showed up later in the evening, and I was having a very hard time finding a pie that I could get really excited about.  So I went with a straight-up meat pizza.  My friend went with a similar one, but a little more toned down.  I don't know what it was, but I just did not care for the pizza at all.  I didn't care for the crust - I thought it needed to be a little less tough.  They way overdid it on the pepperoni, completely overpowering everything else.  It was like Peter Piper without skeeball.  My friend made a better choice with his pie, but it would have still been below average at any of the wood fired pizza places we've visited lately.  The place was nice and quaint, though, and the attached grocery was kind of nice.  But LGO's pizza simply does not stack up."}
{"text":"LGO is by far one of the best restaurants in it's area! The staff is spectacular and polite. The different varieties of pizza are delicious and the pimento cheese dip is to die for. I would highly recommend LGO to anyone.   Great date spot, happy hour, girls night, etc. Really nice for any occasion dress up or be casual; there is a diverse crowd."}
{"text":"What happened to La Grande Orange?  First off, I am usually avoiding airport food except for La Grande Orange at Phoenix Sky Harbor, where the pizzas are absolutely cheesy, tasty and delicious.  We thought we would try the neighborhood version that all the cool kids refer to as \"LGO.\"  Knowing how absolutely delicious the airport version of their cheese pizza was, we ordered two.  They both were essentially crispy overcooked Matzoh with a little cheese on them; definitely no where near the quality of (and I can't believe I am saying this) The Airport Food version!  The barbecue wings were even gross, undercooked, chewy, veiny chicken drums and wings that I would not even feed to my dogs.  It was as-though they painted un-marinated wings with BBQ sauce with a smoky flavor.  Gross.  These meals are not cheap, topping out over $40, for a poor meal.  I gave the wings one star; the pizza three stars; rounded out it is two stars.  Cmon, LGO - yes we love thin crust, crispy pizza, but not when there's a transparent layer of cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"I am a meat lover, but decided to try their veggie burger, just to make it extra hard for them.  Simply put: There is a trade-off between how healthy food is and how good it tastes but this place comes pretty damn close to great in both respects.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Super YUMMY!! My family and I were in town for spring training. We were staying in Laveen. 41 minute drive was worth it. Wish we had one in Bay Area. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I get the hype around La Grand Orange. This place is definitely impressive, from the restaurant itself to the service and of course, the outstanding food.   My sister and I split the chop salad. It was delicious. The ingredients worked so well together - I especially loved the sun dried tomatoes (they were seasoned perfectly. I could eat the tomatoes itself all day). The italian vinaigrette was light but tasty. For the pizza, we ordered half avocado pizza and half The Fallen Angel. The avocado pizza was good and has a strong lemon zest taste to it. It would have been way better with prosciutto (plus $3). My sister and I preferred the other half. The homemade sausage was delicious, along with the roasted peppers. The pizza dough itself is phenomenal, especially when it gets crispy in the ends.   There is definitely multiple reasons why LGO is so popular and high rated. It lives up to the hype. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alright LGO. After several visits and some hard consideration, I will admit that you are probably one of my favorite places in the valley. Now i'm not a \"Regular\" because its too far of a drive for me, but LGO has become that place I think about when I want to treat myself (queue in parks and recs: TREAT YO SELF), bring people from out of town or just suggest a place to eat where I know most people will be happy: it has a variety of options, its not too expensive and the environment is nice but not upscale. See? everybody wins.  Thus far I have managed to try 3 things:  ROASTED CORN PIZZA This is the pizza that Yelp keeps raving about, and I have to say one thing: IT NEEDS MORE CORN. Like tons more corn, its a corn pizza after all, right? I thought the thin crust was great, it was crunchy, it had a nice olive oil drizzle and the cheese was abundant. It was a decent size and it fed me leftovers, which ended up quite well in the toaster oven. Its a great dish to share, especially if.. you know.. it had more corn. (Okay I'll stop now).  SALMON SALAD There are now two salads that I believe are the best thing in the world: the Stetson Chopped from Cowboy Chow and the Salmon Salad here. It came in a plastic box for takeout and I swore I was buying airport food. I didn't even eat it right away, I ended up eating it the next day because my plans changed. I did not expect it to be this good. The fresh salmon, the combo of spinach, arugula, basil, the creamy pearl cous cous, the crunchy seeds and nuts and the dressing. Everything worked perfectly and the portion was very filling for a salad, but definitely doable if that's the only thing you're eating. I made sounds while I was eating it. Yummy sounds. It was awkward.   WILD RICE SALAD The dressing on this salad is the bomb. Luckily I ate it at home and was able to disgracefully lick it clean without anyone looking at me and calling the creep-bulance. I also loved the crunch it had and the flavor of the fresh herbs (don't remember if it was cilantro or mint, but it was strong!). It was pretty filling and pretty great pairing it with any meat. It didn't feel like I was eating a bowl of carbs so my guilt feeling was kept at a minimum. Woo!  So, so far so good. I have many more things to try at LGO and many more yummy sounds to make. Its all about the journey, and let me tell ya, I'm excited."}
{"text":"For anyone who is dairy-free or vegan but still wants to get their pizza fix, I think you won't find a better pizza than LGO. Their cashew cheese is honestly one of the best cheeses I've had. I have been dairy free for about 4 months and LGO is the only pizza I've eaten. Their desserts are also great. I do want to someday come back and try a burger or sandwich as I've heard good things as well. But I don't know if that will ever actually happen because that cashew cheese is insane. Please try it."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here last night after a long hiatus. I remember loving their burger and that was the main reason for my visit. My choices were b/n here or The Grind. I now wish we chose the Grind It's IMHO I prefer the sweet and spicy over at The grind for the same price (12). La Grande does a good job, the burger is huge and was cooked perfectly med-rare. It comes with a \"special sauce\", pickle, tomato, red onion. Very good. reminds me of a diner style burger. The fries were good as well.   We also had a gladiator pizza: topped with sausage and pepperoni. Not a fan of pepp so stuck with the burger. Place was packed like usual and service was decent. Ended my meal next door at their market with a mini coconut cupcake ($2). Solid meal."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie pizza I had here. Great ambience. Wish I had more time to visit their grocery store next door. Next time!"}
{"text":"LGO is my favorite breakfast, lunch and dinner spot. It's always good and the scene is really cool. The commuter sandwich for breakfast is awesome, ANY salad from LGO is amazing, and the goddess pizza is my fav for dinner."}
{"text":"While on business my co-worker and I decided we wanted Pizza. Pulled up my handy Yelp iPhone app and found La Grande Orange Pizzeria near our hotel. It was between LGO and Mama Mia's Brick oven pizza. Glad I chose LGO. Service was quick and the decor was very clean and a smidge upscale from casual. I got the Mushroom Party and my co-worker got the classic cheese so we could split pizzas. The sourdough crust is phenomenal and the pizza's were not greasy (save for the cheese, but not bad). I'm no pizza connoisseur but I've eaten out a lot and hands down, this is the best, freshest tasting pizza I've ever eaten. We had the chips and salsa that also came with a avocado and pimento type of dip. Portions are just the right size and with my Stella Artois on tap, my meal was very enjoyable and satisfying. I found out from the waiter that there are two LGO's in SoCal. One in Pasadena and another in Santa Monica. Both are within driving distance from me and I now plan on soon visiting."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Phoenix.  They have a pizza with slices of avacado that is amazing.  The crust of their pizzas is truely ADDICTIVE!  This is my favorite pizza place.  The atmosphere is great and casual, but with an urban vibe.  You will love this place."}
{"text":"After a 5 mile run this evening, good friend and running partner, Yvonne, decide we were worthy of a little festive snack. We decided to stop in and order a Fallen Angel pizza. Pizza was perfect! Scoops of Caramel and Butter Pecan Gelato was just the only way to end a great evening. Waitress and service were awesome as always. This is a perfect restaurant for lunch, dinner, dessert, or just a kewl spot to meet a friend for coffee and conversation.LGO...Love it! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. However the staff was not very attentive and kept us waiting around for a while. They didn't fill up waters, or check on us to see if we needed anything. We had to ask multiple times for extra plates (table only had 2 at it, and we had 4 people). Pizza was well worth it, but the service kinda took away from the experience."}
{"text":"Delicious choice!  Three of us headed here for dinner on Saturday night around 8:00pm, and had a short 20 minute wait.  We were greeted by a friendly, happy waitress that was on top of everything all night!  We had to try their special Caprese salad, which was served with roasted tomatoes and slightly warmed mozzarella.  The roasted tomatoes were a different taste, but it was flavorful.  We also shared the chips and quac appetizer, which came with a pimento dip and salsa.  We knew what a pimento was - but this dip didn't taste like what you would expect.  When we asked our waitress, she was able to tell us that it didn't contain any pimento but was able to list off other ingredients.  Impressive!    Getting stuffed, somehow we managed to move on to 3 pizzas - the Margarita, the Gladiator, and the vegan Mother Earth.  Yes, they are big enough for two but we just couldn't decide on what to share!  All were delicious, and my vegan sister was impressed with the Mother Earth in all it's veggie goodness.    The food was delicious, service was spot on, environment was cozy - one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"After a long week of only mildly successful work south of the border, I was ready for something easy and comforting, and my Phoenician friend brought me here.  I was immediately tempted by the \"buy the bottle retail and we don't charge you a corkage fee\" and opted for the MollyDooker Boxer, which I don't see that often, but is quite tasty.  Also helps that they can recork and let you take it with you so that you can optimize your cost and your wine experience by choosing the best by the bottle.  For the meal, we split the apple manchego salad and the avocado pizza with prosciutto.  The salad was fresh and tasty and had the right ratio of spinach to toppings, though was a little heavy on the dressing.  The pizza crust was very crisp (in a good way) which was the perfect offset to the smooth texture of the avocado.  Kate said that she was worried that the whole thing would be mushy in the mouth with the avocado but that she was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked with the crispy crust.  For dessert, we of course opted for the gelato.  The feature flavor was lavender-pomegranate-rosewater, and was a heavenly aromatic concoction.  We only got singles, and I don't think I could have handled more than that because it was quite flavorful.    Sure, the parking is limited, but the valet next door is free as long as you validate.  Hope that I get some more trips to Phoenix in the future so that we can go back and try some of the stuff from the cute grocery!"}
{"text":"It looks like they've made some changes!  The parking lot has a sign at the side saying exit only to encourage one way traffic through the tight lot.  They have some spots blocked off out front for basically a \"drive-in\" type of scenario where you sit there until someone comes to take your order, etc.  The line is a lot faster now since everyone at any of the counter spots are ready and willing to take your order.  Couple things though, the sign also says exit only do not enter facing the other way (into the lot) which may cause some people to take it the wrong way.  The spots out front - at least half should be pick up and go spots where you can just park for a few minutes to get your food to go.  It's awkward to sit there for \"full service\"...  They offered me a bag this time which is great!  But that again helped me to forget about silverware and napkins...  It should be part of the process to offer silverware/napkins for obviously to-go orders.  They're slowly but surely making some changes in the right direction!  As I've said, I'm a huge fan of the salads and desserts so this really helps in my ability to incorporate this spot into my life!"}
{"text":"Long lines today for MLK day but fast and efficient service. They got all our order correct and still managed to cook everything as delicious as ever. I love this place for breakfast. The day breaker with a warmed up croissant is perfection and my daughters enjoyed the french pancakes. This place is such a treat!!"}
{"text":"been here two times and i have had some cake, a chicken sandwich, a salad, and everything is a little pricey but worth every single penny!!! will continue to come when i pass by and i am hungry!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are great. My husband loves, loves, loves the Padre. The hamburger and salads are so delicious.  The parking can be a challenge. Just be patient, go early or late and pray for a good spot. Valet parking is a decent option. We have brought our 3 year old daughter there for dinner and she does okay for a toddler. We just promise her a gelato from next door. Actually, we end up buying the gelato and she eats that while we eat dinner and box up her meal for later."}
{"text":"I'm not saying the food isn't good, but overall I feel the experience wasn't so great.  It was kind of expensive for what you get and my server was really pushy and tried to recommend pizzas and drinks after we'd made up our mind and ordered.  I enjoy recommendations, but when I say I want the Avocado pizza, I want the Avocado pizza and am not interested in the corn one."}
{"text":"The lady and I decided last minute that we wanted a nice, relaxing, semi-romantic dinner. Maybe a couple of glasses of wine, nice ambiance and good food. We were looking through places to go to within a 10 mile radius, when we ran into LGO on yelp. I have been inside to check it out, but never had I had dinner there. What a fantastic decision! The place is so nice, they play good music and the wine we loved was on the list... For 10 dollars a bottle! I couldn't believe it! I thought it was $10 a glass! We had arrived later than we thought we would've, but no one ever made us feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. I was so pleased with Ryan, our server. Super nice, very accommodating and knowledgeable. Right before leaving, I asked to speak to a manager to give Ryan a commendation, and was even more pleased when talking to Chris. I have worked in restaurants before, and rarely have I met a manager (owner?) so personable, warm and genuinely kind. This SUPER nice guy, who treats his employees very well, was helping the place close down. His philosophies of being in the business were spot on and pragmatic. I was so pleased with the service overall, that even if the food was bad, I would go back. Good thing it was lovely. Please go here, you will love it."}
{"text":"Hands down La Grand Orange makes some of the best pizza in Phoenix! The corn pizza, the gladiator and the padre pizza are heaven. I'm not a big fan of their gluten free pizza crust so be sure to order the original crust. Add some red velvet cake from the bakery for dessert. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often and have always had a great experience. Customer service rocks, food is excellent, reasonably priced, and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great night out!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to LGO for over 16 years, always enjoying their delicious sour dough crusted pizza that they still will not serve until after 4:00pm on weekdays (so the dough can mature every morning). The pizza has always been consistently the best in Phoenix IMHO. The Avocado is especially my favorite. Also the coffee/espresso is hard to beat."}
{"text":"slightly over-rated....enough cannot be said about location....coffee is amazing....interpol on the speakers previous visit heightens any experience, add another half star..."}
{"text":"this pizza is excellent. the original recipes are tasty but the fact you can use any of the original and unique topping to make your own as well just takes the cake. I have had some great brick over pizza but this is some of the best ever. the place was packed but the modern, airy, spacious decor is not a rouse- there is a lot of room in this space to accommodate even large parties. it is clearly a popular place for a reason. there is a grocery attached with kitchy and typically over-priced girts and snacks but the selection of these nick-nacks is great. there is also a gelato place attached as well which looked busy as well."}
{"text":"We got a growler of kombucha and the pizza was delicious!  My wife enjoyed the burger with the farmer's market vegetables.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I know this is an oldie but such a goodie!! From the salads, sandwiches, pastries to pizza. The music is loud, the parking sucks but La Grande Orange has created its own buzz that I enjoy. It has created kind of a bohemian atmosphere with the tribal sounds of brazillian music! Sundays after a climb on camelback make for a great brunch/lunch dealio. Every time I get a take-out salad from LGO - people always ask me where I got it from. They now have curb-side service so you dont have to aggrivate yourself for a parking spot - YAY!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a party of 5 at about 7pm.  I've never seen the place so uncrowded before.  It was great.  Didn't have to wait 30 mins for a table.  Parking still sucked though.  I got my usual.  The green chili burger without the bun but instead of fries I got the Caesar.  The salad was just eh and I should have ordered the corn instead.  Next time.  Anyway, the burger was very good.  I still have no idea why it just doesn't come with ketchup on the side and you have to ask for it instead.  The service pretty much sucked.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive and 2 out of the 5 orders were screwed up.  The manager came by to say sorry and said the 2 meals were comped.  That was nice.  The waiter also gave us a piece of the red velvet cake which was also very nice because the red velvet cake is excellent and some of the best around.  ** Update 5/16/10 **  I received a \"compliment\" about my review above.  It said, \"F*ck you douche bag\".  Not sure who it was but I politely said I don't swing that way and thanks for the offer.  The guy probably works there and just has a Yelp account to send random emails.  Anyway,  I am flattered."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, reasonable prices, nice ambiance and decent service. Enough said."}
{"text":"What is with this wait that people complain about here?  I pretty much only go on Friday and Saturday nights around 7 or 8 pm and we usually get a table within 15 minutes or sit right down at the chef's table.  The parking is a nightmare, but I since given up on trying to find a regular parking spot after they expanded to like a dozen 15 minute spots. After one of their parking dudes they pay to stand around and make wild motions at BMWs told me just to park in one after I got screwed out of two spots that opened up for me I haven't looked back.  The pizza is absolutely perfect thin crust pizza. It is amazingly consistent in particular with its crust in comparison to places like Cibo where the pizza is hit-and-miss and the center of the pizza is often soggy.  They have some fancy combinations of pizzas available, but its really just the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of cooking that make it great. My stand-by is the avocado pizza with prosciutto. You top that with their awesome Parmesan cheese, some descent wine, maybe an orange fennel salad, and a David Bowie marathon for a meal that competes well against orgasms in the battle for human stimulation.  And then there is that amazing authentic Italian gelato shop next door to top it off. Damn. I'm surprised that in a red state, Republicans don't pass a law to shut down this type of place. Or maybe just prohibit them from selling alcohol in combination with such a stimulating environment like they do at strip clubs that do the full monty."}
{"text":"The pizza was good.  However, $14 for a smallish pizza that they say serves two is high, I think.  And I can't imagine it serving two hungry adults unless you had an appetizer.  My husband and son shared a gluten free one with sausage and pepperoni.  They loved it.  The gluten free crust was more of a cracker than a crust- super thin and crunchy.  The sausage looked delicious.  Big chunks.  My girls and I shared a cheese pizza with goat cheese and roasted garlic.  It was really good but I kept thinking it was missing something.  Would have loved roasted pine nuts on it.  That is not an option on the menu.  I was not a fan of the gelato place connected.  I thought the portion sizes were really small for a gelato place and it was pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!! I got the gladiator one with vegan cheese. The pepperoni was so good!!! The cashew cheese was so good!!! Loved everything about it other than the price. Have to pay extra for vegan cheese. Will probably come here once a month  or every couple of weeks."}
{"text":"I can't say how much I love this place. It has by far the best pizza I have ever tasted. My husband and I always get the pico, chips and guacamole, then a margarita pizza, and then the best gelato ever. Love how they always have new flavors to choose from. We live in Montana now and it's so sad to not be near LGO anymore to the point I had my mom fly up from Arizona bringing me a pizza, salted brownie and pico dip"}
{"text":"This place was what first opened my eyes to Arcadia after moving back from California. I really like the little shop and of course the English muffins, it's always busy... Always. My parents like the food but hate coming here because they think it's too hectic, so I usually meet up with some girl friends and one of us grabs a table. Parking is a pain in the ass. They really should've built a garage above the new burger place across the street to save us the hassle haha."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is SUPER crowded all the time!!!   The pizza is pretty good, they have some nice combinations (mushroom party).  The salads are also tasty.  And the bakery bread is delicious.  The cupcakes and other sweets in the display looked really good.   It's kind of like your normal gourmet type of sandwich shop.  It's a little on the pricey side but that's expected for where/what it is.  One drawback...it seems to be valet parking for $3.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.  I wouldn't be so pleased to pay for valet to run in for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"This year we decided to get our Thanksgiving dinner from LGO Everything went smooth ,pick up was easy ,food was amazing. I would do it again in a heartbeat we fed nine people and everybody loved it. The best pumpkin pie I've ever had"}
{"text":"Intriguing menu.  Ended up going with Cubano sandwich, chickpea wrap and cupcakes which were all awesome!  The service was friendly, cool décor.  I will defiantly be visiting again."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in the nation! Always plan a visit to LGO whenever I'm in Phoenix. You won't be disappointed! I had the Avocado Pizza plus prosciutto, and it was amazing! Sad to say they no longer have the insulate caprese salad on the menu, but the pizza is was truly keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I was just introduced to La Grande Orange this week, never having heard of it before. I went with a friend who has been before so she knew the menu pretty well already. We ordered the Avocado Pizza, Caprese Salad and Tortilla Soup. Everything was delicious, especially the pizza crust. The lemon zest on the crust was surprisingly yummy.   The service was very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is attached to a gelato shop and an Italian market, which you can order to go food from or select from already prepared sandwiches and other items. I didn't have a chance to check out the market, but hope to make it back very soon."}
{"text":"great little spot... i think the pizza is very good... the people i went with fell in love with the chicken wings... and i can see why... they are grilled, which you dont always find at food places... i like the atmosphere... it is super casual and has some good drinks... check it out if you are in the area and not in the mood for postinos"}
{"text":"I remember when LGO was a new concept. It was like...'oh they have this big table and you can sit there with the person next to you and they call that community style dining'...  LGO has so much going for it. Yes the food is good and the Avocado Pizza Add Prosciutto is hands down the best. Yes the coffee is also delish - order the Cuban.   But the grocery section should not be overlooked. The assortment of scarves and housewares and hipster sketchbooks and girly jewelry holders should not distract you....... From the WINE and the CHEESE! Oh my gosh. Grab some Edam and a bottle of Cannonball and call it a night. They really have some good vino and eats here for dinner making. Oh! And get some red velvet from the bakery case to go. Salivating now.   Thank goodness they finally setup an overflow parking lot.  Now you have no excuse not to come here."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I love their breakfast, coffee, and their CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES! mmmm! I have yet to try their pizza. Every time I come in the employees are always friendly, everyone is happy to be there, and I can shop while I wait for my food."}
{"text":"This is admittedly only my second time here but both times I have been blown away. The vibe is fantastic, lots of low key band posters around, a mini store, and a full scale pizza oven right in the dining area. If you are into pizza, then this is the holy grail, these pizzas are fanfreakingtastic. The Gladiator is easily one of my favorite pizzas ever, and the Margherita pizza is insane as well. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The only qualm is the mandatory valet parking in the back lot, but other than that, this place is fantastic"}
{"text":"The only drag about LGO is the crush of people and the lack of parking. Otherwise, there's little not to like about this place.  Beyond the entire LGO experience, the Pizzeria's pies are astounding. They may not be Bianco level, but the sourdough crust is enough to set them apart and wait is rarely more than 10 minutes, even with pickup. We particularly love the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza (add Italian sausage for richer flavor). The burgers are amazing, too. Some of the best in the city.  Oh, and the white sangria. Get that. Beer-wise, the selection is limited.  Service is typically excellent, though sometimes there's a wait for a table. I recommend getting there sooner rather than later so you can find a seat and the buzz from the sangria can last the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"Absolutely miserable experience. Not sure what we enjoyed more, the bar tender's complete disdain for our mere presence or her total disregard for our dining experience and business. Great pizza and drinks but shameful service."}
{"text":"LGO can be a bit overwhelming the first time in, but trust me, you will LOVE IT. The food is delicious - I love coming here for breakfast and getting the commuter sandwich and coffee. The sandwich is served on their amazing English muffins and I have it with egg + bacon + cheddar (minus tomato + mayo). The pastries are a great treat to share or gift as well.  1. Browse all the unique items/gift ideas 2. Order 3. Find a seat 4. Send someone back up in a couple minutes because they will call your name when your food is ready at the end of the counter where you ordered 5. Enjoy your yummy food and great company or people watching"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite pizza place.  Ate here years ago on a short trip through Phoenix.  I was blown away by the pizza.  SOurdough crust was amazing and the particular pizza I ate, had a balsamic vinegar reduction glaze which was incredible mixed with the pizza.  At the time, it was a sit down restaurant where you waited to be seated and now when I went back recently it was a completely different style where you order, take a number and then seat yourself.    The major problem with this place, which almost had me giving it a 4 star review, is that the parking is TERRIBLE! But: then I remembered the sea salt and caramel cookie...yep 5 stars.  Definitely a pizza place worth going out of the way for.  We were back recently in the Phoenix area and drove for miles just to get back here.  So happy we did."}
{"text":"People complain that Phoenix doesn't have good pizza, but obviously have not been to LGO.  So amazing. Great toppings, carmelized cheese, it's beautiful.  Can't speak much to service, but the food is a masterpiece."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is always delicious meal whenever I go and staff is very friendly.  Whether its the pizza, salad or appetizer, we always have a nice time in a relaxing and comfortable setting.  I have also heard from friends but not tried yet the breakfast - it is apparently one of the best breakfasts around.  Will need to go soon.  Whenever my mom is in town, we always make our way over to LGO.  One of our favorites is the grilled artichokes and brusselsprouts.  You cannot go wrong, trust me.    If you're looking for good wine for a good price, try this place.  Honestly, everything is excellent on the menu so whatever you go with, you're going to have a good meal."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The sourdough crust is pure bliss. Also love the grilled wings with homemade blue cheese dressing. Great little restaurant on one side and store on the other. Pick a bottle of wine for dinner - no corking fee!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Arcadia area. Normally I just get their cheese pizza, which is best of Phoenix. Don't believe the media on other places. This is it. However, they say the pizza feeds 1-2 people. It doesn't. It is a single person pizza. Don't get fooled. If you are 2 people, get 2 pizzas. You might have a very small amount to take home, but it's better Han going hungry. I tried for the first time the hamburger tonight - good, but their sister restaurant across the street is better for burgers. Stick with the pizza, it's what makes LGO famous."}
{"text":"Updated Review: After dealing with a horribly rude hostess at LGO I was contacted by the management who handled the situation very professionally and made sure I would come back. I am quite curious if she is still working there. The food and service are typically great so hoping they just start hiring more professional hosts. After writing a negative review here originally, just know you might get privately messaged by an angry staff member. After the situation I have gone in to LGO and this time avoiding their host staff by sitting at a high top on the bar area. The servers were really nice and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"First time ever coming into this place and was immediately overwhelmed by all of the clutter and \"stuff\" for sale, although a cool concept just overwhelming with how many people seem to visit this place. Not much for parking here either unless you want to valet. We ordered two iced chai teas and a iced green tea. The green tea was decent although lacking in flavor and the chai tea was just awful. It tasted like black licorice, definitely the worst chai tea I've ever had. Not to mention the \"large\" cups were tiny and cost almost 5 dollars..probably won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"New York is famous for its pizza but this place perfected and refined it to a culinary masterpiece. You must try before you die."}
{"text":"Fun place. The avocado pizza missed a little for me, difficult to eat but had great flavors. Wings are juicy and nice bbq flavor. Good espresso.   Fun, casual, dining experience. I like these grocery store style spots. Grab what you want to drink, beer, wine, soda, take up to the counter, place your order, pay and then open seating."}
{"text":"The ambiance of LGO is out of control. I love their Margherita Pizza the best, I've never had a bad meal here.  My only gripe is access to parking but that's beyond their control. Best pizza I've ever had! If you're in Phoenix and looking for a good pizza come here.  Also pro tip - their curbside pick up is super convenient, just call ahead to beat the parking trouble."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the longest time. You definitely get a neighborhood feel when you come eat and shop at La Grande Orange. One of my favorite things to get is the Gladiator pizza. If it's your first time coming here, you must get it. They also let you customize and add items to your pizza. To drink, I would get the sangria, its one of my to go drinks when I visit LGO. Also if you are planning to come here for lunch, they have tons of pick up and go options. If you are planning to do dinner here, make sure you show up early as it gets packed."}
{"text":"LGO has the most amazing sourdough crust pizza! It's thin and crispy but has a nice texture to the dough. We always get The Fallen Angel pizza! Sausage, fennel, peppers and onions.  Delicious!! Plus, you're able to buy wine at retail, re-cork and bring the leftovers home!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there this week and truly were blown away be terrific service.  We were confused about where to order and the manager came over to find me and explain how it worked. She couldn't have been nicer - Kimber.  Our server was great too but Kimber really stood out in providing exemplary service.  She felt badly that it was confusing about their system and compted glasses of wine for each of us. Now if I could only get LGO to come east to the Washington DC area I would be set."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming back here.  We ordered the ceviche which was so salty that my lips burned. The next day my lips peeled they were so burned.  The pizza was ok but not worth the hassle of this place with slow service.  Never again."}
{"text":"What a great place for a nice dinner! As a matter of fact I loved the whole corner this place is located on. Started off with the cheese plate which was very good and finished off with a pizza! You really cant go wrong with anything off their menu."}
{"text":"I love LGO! My favorite pizzas are the Roasted Corn pizza and the Avocado pizza. Tip! There is sea salt on the table for a reason. Sprinkle that goodness on your pizza to amplify the flavors to pure heaven! I also finish my meal off with a Sea Salt chocolate chip cookie (after wiping off half of the salt first, too overpowering for me). My kids like the burger and the wings with ranch are some of the best around! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Sourdough crusted pizza??? Yes that's the difference maker here. It works so well cause it's extra crunch on the outer crush and chewy on the inside. I got the pizza of half gladiator and half margarhita. It was a pizza that our whole table enjoyed. They've also got a store on the side that sells baked goods and gelato. Delicious as well!  Recommendation: gladiator pizza! And mint gelato"}
{"text":"Pizza, salad, beer and a burger, sounds generic enough however there are a few things that make this place shine.  The beer at $6 pint is is not cheap but bring a growler and for $12 you can get 4 beers as long as you don't mind just one type. For wine they have an attached market with okish prices again they sell the wine with the pizza for the same price (score).  The Pizza it self, thin crust cooked in a open  fire oven. The mushroom party was the best party in my mouth or elsewhere. Sweet caramelized onions  along with a mix of mushrooms and cheese made for a real hit. The avocado pizza was unique but I found the rich avocado to be a bit overpowering for the crust.   The salads were all good that may be due to the large amount of dressing on them.   Ambiance, is like any other trendy place, a bit too loud and maybe a bit too dim, -I really sound  old."}
{"text":"Very cute, little neighborhood spot. It's a nice place to grab a simple brunch or lunch with or without friends. They have a big community table suitable for solo dining. Their pizzas are top notch. I'm a sucker for wood fire pizzas and theirs is pretty amazing.   No waiter service. You order at the counter and wait for your name to be called. They have a breakfast/sandwich station, a pizza and burger station, and a coffee station. There are also ready prepped salads in the case you can quickly pick up. Also at the counter, there is a decent selection of baked goods.   Parking can get crowded at times but there is always people coming and going that you'll eventually find a spot... so you just have to be a little patient."}
{"text":"Ashley was awesome!  The gluten free pizza was terrific as always.  First time having the Pimento Dip...it is a welcome change from the old salsa."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the country! It did not disappoint. This was my 2nd visit. The service was excellent. Beer was great on draft- hit the spot on a hot day. We got a veggie pizza for us and a cheese pizza for the kids. We ordered a third one thinking kids were still hungry and we would have leftovers - but we ate it all! So good!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The pizzas are the second best in town. They have great drinks, especially the sangrias. The sea salt cookies warmed up and covered in gelato are to die for. But the parking sucks. All day, every day. And the manager is not the friendliest person. Other than that, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Mother Earth Pizza!  We finally made it here!  We attempted to go to the Arcadia Farmer's Market, but it will not be open until October 20th...so, thanks for not updating your website.  I love the market and pizzeria set up.  We ordered a Mother Earth, thin sourdough crusted pizza topped with peppers, artichokes, fennel, mushrooms, broccolini and artisan cheeses.  I ordered a kids pizza and it came with marinara topped with cheese on a split English muffin.  I wasn't sure if my little cutie pie would like it...it was a winner!  He asked me to make one just like it at home.    We shared a pumpkin pie and oatmeal cookie. The pie could have been a tad deeper.  It was very good and creamy, but looked like they ran out of filling it was spread pretty thin.  We liked the casual ambiance...we're planning to come back for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Please. Super overrated crap. If this place were in any other city than PHX it would have gone under years ago. The whole concept is Blah. Pizza crust is CRAP! Hate the cliental, talk about pretentious Douchebags which make it even more ridiculous! I have always felt underwhelmed with the food here and in their breakfast/lunch side. It's mediocre at best. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I have only been this once (so far) but I really had a great meal tonight.  Our pizza was a great sourdough and the cheese was a marvelous blend that I just haven't found anywhere in Phoenix.  The waitress took the time to really help us tailor our meal to our particular tastes and her wine suggestion was spot on.  We ordered the gladiator pizza (adding mushrooms and ham).  The wings we got were a bit fatty so they suggested I let them throw them back on the grill a bit longer to crisp them up a bit more.  That did the trick and they were a great BBQ chicken wing flavor.  After they did all this and I'd been made happy, the manager came over and asked how they were and said he'd taken it off the bill.  Wow, not expected.  Specially since they were great and I'd get them again in fact, thank you.  The one thing about the meal that really stuck out was the deserts.  The chocolate, peanut butter, ganache, and gram cracker pie was so good.  The walnut brownie we rich, chewy, and everything was so fresh tasting.  The strawberry gelato was obviously fresh berries and I could have just eaten a bowl of that by itself.  I know it sounds like I'm gushing here, but it's just so great to me when I find places like this.  Thanks for the great night."}
{"text":"So bummed. I ordered curbside and my mistake for not checking my order before i left but my pizza was wrong. I ordered The padre pizza and it is missing the prosciutto.This is the SECOND time this has happened to me, same issue. I understand its not on the menu anymore but I have since been able to order it plenty of times and it come out correctly. Normally i wouldnt say anything but its not cheap and its the second time! So frustrating."}
{"text":"Fun place. Tasty gelato. Cool little shop too. Didn't get any food but loved my hazelnut cream gelato and my wife's sorbets: lemon and passion fruit, especially, was off the hook."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually order the mushroom party pizza add egg or roasted corn pizza add egg. So good! One time I ordered take out from LGO and the egg wasn't cooked on the pizza properly and I just called them and they said the next pizza was on them and it was. Great service. I will keep continuing to return!  PS Kale Salad is also really good as well as the Cheeseburger on the english muffin!"}
{"text":"Vegan Pizza. Very dry wish they had a vegan pizza sauce to dip. Highly recommend this place either way!"}
{"text":"Nom, Nom.  Love the location and food.An eatery that deserves more praise than there is room or words for.   The atmosphere was fun  even on a busy weekend evening.  The wait staff was attentive and timely."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Ordered a pizza and wings for takeout and they were delicious; love the curbside pickup. The place looks adorable; we will definitely be back to dine-in."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times since my last review and every time I visit, the pizza only gets better. This is now my favorite pizza place in Phoenix and they have a great selection of wine as well. I would definitely recommend the \"Rocket Man\" here to anyone looking to try a new pizza."}
{"text":"Very good.  The staff is warm and friendly.  The atmosphere is nice and very clean.  The pizza and salads are tasty.  Not lacking much here."}
{"text":"We went to LGO with my inlaws & husband for our anniversary dinner.  We had 3 pizzas- corn, veggie, and a veggie with chillies on it. All 3 were great, we actually had a discussion to determine which one was better.  All of us are looking forward to going soon, my inlaws live in Glendale & want to come and pick up pizza from LGO now!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars just for this visit.  I got their avocado and proscuitto pizza with egg whites. I was disappointed by their proscuitto; it was thick and tough. I also wasn't happy with the way they cooked their egg whites. They usually crack and separate the egg white onto the middle of the pizza. Then they stick it back in the oven and let it cook for a few minutes. This time they cooked it in a skillet and put it on top of the pizza. It wasn't the same as baking it right onto the pizza.   I was disappointed by this visit. I bought a LGO mug anyways. I wanted to be reminded of my favorite lunch spot back home. I love them that much."}
{"text":"Great pizza, salads and a variety of frost that is consistent with quality.  Cashew cheese for those that are dairy free and amazing labeled wines - we are regulars and if we want consistency and a great atmosphere to experience - this is the place."}
{"text":"The parking is rough and so is the navigating of ordering but we figured it out . We decided to share a salad and a pizza and were told to take a pre-made salad from the fridge near the front of the store . I felt like a sardine squishing threw all the people in line trying to get into the fridge and then I almost wasn't able to reach my Sonoma Salad because it was against the back and hard for me to reach .  Next we needed to wait in the pizza area for the pie and all the seats were filled . I noticed a nice mixed crowd of people but there were many Hipsters just hanging out reading or playing on their computers taking up space . I spotted  couple leaving from the community table so we jumped into that spot . The people leaving cleared the plates and I brushed the crumbs off our area .   I was given the wrong Ice tea and got a fruity one instead of a plain one I just drank it . ( no big deal) The Sonoma Salad was very large and had really good cheese in it so it was good but not \"Slap your Momma Good\" because it had very little taste other than the cheese .  So now we get our pizza we ordered the one that has Rocket in the name that was suppose to be spicy . THIS PIZZA WAS NOT SPICY . It was edible , it was OK  and pretty looking but not that tasty and lacking seasoning especially SALT and the cheese wasn't ooey or gooey but I did LIKE that the crust was super thin . I have tried food from here from the free food event on Camelback Rd and also from the Art Museum and it seemed a level higher than what I tried here so possibly it depends on what you order too .  While we were dining the Woman who sat across from us opened up a used germed up paper to read and since the table is so thin the newspaper was touching our plates and THAT BOTHERED US and than she kept yapping at us while we were trying to eat .   You won't feel lonely eating here .  This place has a novelty gift ware section to browse and the sell imported cheeses and house made English Muffins (6@ $9.95) You can purchase a bottle of Good Wine here at the market price and drink it here with no additional charge ."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here last month and enjoyed every single bite!  Don't miss out on their freshly made english muffins.  The place is packed as usual and it doesn't seem to matter what time of day or what day you go here. This can make your experience a little harried  if your not used to it.  I did notice that there is an outside area to get drinks or sit at.  Look for this if the weather permits.  Would love to come back strictly for dessert.  Their selection looks amazing!"}
{"text":"LGO is hands down my FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix! I am gluten free and it's hard to find great gluten feee food! LGO has mastered the gluten free cooking! If you haven't gone, you need to go now!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday, and it was a good breakfast spot. It was CRAZY busy though! But, it's order at the counter style, so no matter how busy it is, you can get your order in. Then the only problem is finding a table. We finally got one, but it was RIGHT by the main entrance, so not the best feng shui.   PROS: The patio is dog-friendly, it's a happening spot, they have a unique menu, and you can get your order in right away.  CONS: Parking is a nightmare. It's really packed. They call your name when your order is ready and it's IMPOSSIBLE to hear them call you when it's busy, so if you're not waiting right by the kitchen, your food will get cold! Mine did. Also, strangely, the tables do not have salt and pepper on them...so...um...bring your own??? idk. I like to put salt and pepper on my eggs, but there wasn't any on the table! Also, NO HOT SAUCE! I asked the woman at the counter for hot sauce, and she seemed surprised! She said to ask the people at the coffee counter....weird. Um...no...they did not have any hot sauce at the coffee counter. I'd still go back again, but I would just bring salt, pepper, and hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here today. It was very good! I got the Margarita pizza and added pepperoni, spinach and sun dried tomatoes:) The staff was friendly! The pizza plus the add on's came out to be $21.78 as I only had water to drink. The atmosphere is amazing and enjoyable! I asked if they had a military/ law enforcement discount but the waitress did not know unfortunately which is fine."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan of LGO from when they started as a grocery store and then added the great pizzeria. Overall, great food at reasonable prices. The vibe is loud music, colorful decor and lots of people waiting in line. Sometimes the service is slow or a bit 'french' because of the volume of people, but the food makes up for it. You can't go wrong with about anything there, but if you want to try something different try their cerviche.  Now what is it ? Ceviche is traditionally a South American dish made by marinating pieces of fish or shellfish in citrus juice. Their version is the best I have ever had, it very fresh, bursting with lime, shrimp and healthy vegtables. It's a great way to start a dinner and don't forget to have a sangria along with it."}
{"text":"*Realized this got posted to their Bake Shop Yelp page instead, so posted here now.  LGO is what I believe to be one of Phoenix's coolest CONCEPTS. The execution of their plan, however is subpar. I understand it's supposed to be quaint and they've been in the same spot years and why they wouldn't expand so the rest of the people complaining about space should remember the kind of environment they're going for. However, given the fact that there is lack of space inside the restaurant and for parking, the \"servers\" should be a little more aware of their surroundings and to be be blunt, they should be a little more customer-service oriented. They are, for lack of a better term, rude. YOU WORK IN A RESTAURANT AND A BUSY ONE, PEOPLE ARE PAYING YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. So take a minute and slow down. The last time I was in there, two separate employees actually ran into me, when they could have avoided it by slowing down and looking where they were going. Not to mention, NEITHER of them said excuse me or apologized. They also don't make way for customers, instead, they just keep walking and allow the customers to make way for them.   These employees are so disorganized and frantic. So much so that even when I call in an order and come early and let them know I'm there, they still let my pizza sit and I still take home cold pizza.   Also last time I was in, I first went to the coffee bar to look at that menu and I'm aware that is not where you typically order or pick up. While I was at that station, I asked a girl who was organizing her book if they had matcha. She looked at me like I was inconveniencing her for asking that and confused, then said I don't think so and walked away. Then another employee walked up and said, and I quote, \"actually you don't order here, you can go over to where the line is,\" in a very rude manner.   I think the concept is great, it is overall very quaint and delicious when the employees don't let my food sit and get cold. Great environment, great music, valet & self-parking available, I have no problems with those things I have seen other complaints about. I do, however, have a problem with their employees being so rushed (I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BUSY) and so rude. I hope that management sees this and really considers hiring some people that can handle themselves under stress, are more aware of their surroundings and are more friendly."}
{"text":"There's really nothing I can say about LGO Pizzeria that hasn't been said. I'm just doing this review so I can add it to my Phoenix gems list. I've had LGO Pizzeria on my radar for a couple of years. Everyone would rave about how delicious the food is but I never checked it out because of the crazy parking situation. I was hungry after seeing a movie at the Esplanade and for some reason my intuition told me to go to LGO! I got there an hour before they closed and it wasn't busy at all.  I ordered the baked chicken wings for my boyfriend and a gladiator pizza for me. The waiter described the wings as smokey with a slight barbeque flavor. I'm not a fan of chicken wings but I could eat these wings all day. On to the pizza.....Probably the best pizza I've ever had. The crust, the sauce, and all the ingredients were top notch. I was in heaven.   I am so happy I finally made it to LGO Pizzeria. I understand what all the hype is about. There is something so special about this place I can't describe it. I want to move down the street so I can stop by everyday!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  There isn't a single menu item I have ever had that was bad, the people working there are friendly, and though the parking is scarce, there's valet if it gets really bad.    Do yourself a favor and just go if you've never been, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Trendy place with good menu offerings. I had the cheese board appetiser and a pizza. The pizza was good but didn't blow me away. Parking would be impossible if not for the free valet. (Which isn't free if you tip like any decent human should!)  Service was friendly and attentive even though they were busy. Overall it was good enough that I would try it again."}
{"text":"\"LGO\" is great. There is the grocery and the pizzeria - if you go there for breakfast or lunch, you will have to order at the grocery and then there is self-serve seating in the pizzeria. They do not serve pizza until the evening (and then they no longer serve certain sandwiches and other breakfast/lunch items in the evening). In the evening, the pizzeria becomes more of the traditional go to the hostess to be guided to your seat sort of thing. That sort of explains the chaos/mayhem some of the other posts have alluded to that can happen in the mornings. However, I believe this particular entry is for the pizzeria, which is more dinner oriented.  Some tasty dishes that I have had that I would recommend:  Evil Princess Thai Chicken Salad Gladiator Pizza Mushroom Party Pizza (add proscuitto) Avocado Pizza (add proscuitto) Fish Sandwich Cheeseburger on english muffin  The guacamole and cheese dip thingy (it's not called that, but I'm blanking) are good too - I believe it's a three dip appetizer platter of some sort.    The food here is really tasty. They also have some nice bottles of wine on their list (and in the grocery). Great place for a non-stuffy date or for a decent sized group of people (although probably not more than like 8) to share a bunch of pizza/apps.   One last thing: parking can be a real pain. I usually just suck it up and valet - it's free if you get it validated in the restaurant. Throw the valet person a few bucks - why not?"}
{"text":"Pizza ia simply great. service has been super last few times we have been in and previous;y that hasn't always been the case! Rocket man is simply to die for- nice and spicy with lots of veggies. Not often offered BUT they made the best brussel sprouts I have ever had."}
{"text":"Come here on a Sunday when you're hungover.  Pick a table in the center of the dining room and vegetatively sit and stare out of the large plate glass windows wondering why, between Mastro's the previous night, El Santo all day Saturday, and the Candy Store, you somehow managed to blow just over 700 bucks this weekend.  LGO is a charm with its high energy young crowd adorned in yoga pants, and, its older hipsters, also wearing yoga pants.It would appear this place is some kind of Mecca for yoga pant aficionados.  The music is cool too. A friend recently spent the day here working, Shazaming their playlists. She found most of the songs on Pandora's 'Lumineers' station.  Anyway, I ate a chopped turkey salad, or at least a part of it while pensively gazing out the window, as If I was working on a cure for dick cancer or something.  The salad and a soda was ten bucks.  This is a great move, staring out of windows. Others will think you're an eccentric genius or something as you mindlessly stare directly through them while revisiting your bonehead moves from the weekend. A chuckle to yourself every now and again as you think about how Mastro's gets away with charging 11 bucks for a baked potato, and how a certain stripper at the Candy Store will pull out her false teeth for only a buck.   [another wave of nausea, hang on a sec]  As I said, this is a great place to feel good about yourself when you get a load of how other people are more screwed-up than yourself. Granny hipsters in unfulfilled (pancake butt) yoga pants that oddly enough, manage to somehow telegraph the outline of an equally loose fitting thong.  Now there's a nice 'eewww' moment.  I yakked up the salad afterwards, but it had nothing to do with the food or the ill-fitted thongs. I think it was the hard-boiled egg and my hellacious hangover. The thong visual was pretty messed up though. Anyway, a strong recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place... Everything on the menu is amazing! I you haven't tried the breakfast here, you're missing out. Only down side is that breakfast hours are self seating times and dining room fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I'll start this review by saying I have not read a SINGLE review on this place prior to writing mine.  I am familiar with it 'cuz I grew up in the area and remember when it was a U-Totem convenience market. (OK, did I just date myself?)   I had actually avoided it because i heard that the parking was difficult and that it was inordinately crowded at all times.    Went there about 2 weeks ago.  My sibs scheduled a dinner visit there, and I went over around 7pm, mid-week, after work.      Parking was a bear- then i found the Valet.  I recommend- USE THE VALET.  You can get \"validated\" and then parking is free (except remember to tip the Dude, OK?)  My fam had ordered, which was fine with me.  Within minutes, a delicious fruit sangria was poured, and I delighted in the most yummy salad!  Pizzeria Chopped Salad, with its eclectic mix of raisins, sundried tomatoes, vinaigrette, and more.  I'm not a big fan of raisins, but don't let that throw you off of this salad- it's a perfect blend of ingredients.  I coulda hogged the salad, but played nice and shared.  They also ordered CLASSIC MARGHERITA Pizzas, which were sublime.  Brick oven flavor, awesome cheese, perfect balance of ingredients.    OK, OK, I'm going back!  I'll get over my impatient self, if this is what I have to look forward to.  Prices were in line with the quality and freshness of food.  Good professional wait staff."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is in my neighborhood, I like their bakery goods, and even bought cookies and bars for my mom's memorial. Because it's close, I have tried to move past the extreme lack of customer service. This has been a constant, in fact one of the counter staff misquoted a deal. I had ordered and asked a question, so she asked a coworker who told her she'd made a mistake, and there was no deal. I asked for it to be honored and got a no. A manager was brought over, she honored what I was told. Still no apology, I thanked the woman who made the mistake when paying. She told me not to expect this discount ever again. I was floored. Too bad, their hiring practices are so poor."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for sometime now, the food is great, especially the chip and dip trio!   I love coming here for a glass of wine and to a casual and relaxing ambiance after a long day of work. The service is great and in case one glass of wine isn't enough they sell by the bottle at their own grocery next door ."}
{"text":"Good spot with good pizza, particularly the Roasted Corn, but the hype and crowds don't quite justify the hassle.  I go usually when I need to get a gelato fix at Archellinos or my wife has her bi-monthly Tammie Coe Red Velvet cravings.  Memo to LGO ownership:  It's called a parking lot and they were developed to provide ease and convenience to patrons.  I'd recommend looking into getting one."}
{"text":"Uhhhh yum, I have never had sourdough crust pizza, but it was perfection!! Everyone we encountered was very nice! Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because we live super close and by the time my husband brought the pizza home it was already cold. Can't wait to dine in & try this pizza fresh!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review for LGO... but I realize it is more appropriate for the 'Grocery' section.  The Pizzeria section doesn't have near the same issue with overcrowdedness.  But you still have to contend with people sucking up valuable seating space while working on their ipads..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite eatery in Phoenix!!! I cannot express enough how much I absolutely love this place!!!  This ambiance is very casual/chill - very cool vibe and good music to compliment the atmosphere.  The service is usually on point, it's very convenient to call in and place take out orders or you can pick up your order curb side as well.  If you have the time I prefer to eat in ...   The food here is pure AWESOME-ness! ;) The pizza here is far superior to that of other spots in phoenix ... Their cheeseburger and Reuben are amongst some of my favorite eats as well! Additionally, they always have fairly healthy soups on the menu ...  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone ... Whenever I have friends in town I like to introduce them to LGO ;)"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange - LGO - The Big O  LGO is one of the best places for breakfast in Phoenix.  Recently, I visited LGO for brunch and I am so glad I did. I have found a new favorite restaurant when I want to grab a pizza, sandwich, or delicious sweet treat.    You can't help from noticing the long line of patrons gathering for their morning fix at La Grande Orange, but don't let the crowd discourage you, LGO is worth the wait . Parking at LGO can be a challenge.  However, valet service is available.  LGO has a hip vibe with a café/local maket feel. The staff at LGO are very accommodating in helping you find exactly what your looking for.  Give yourself some extra time to browse while at LGO, there are various trinkets and goodies.  You'll find so many interesting gifts and items for yourself or a friend.    On this visit we started off with salads.  A Caesar and  a Caprese.  The salads were fresh, crispy,  and delicious. After our salads came the pie. We  ordered a cheese and sausage, all I can say is the pie was  devoured.  The crust was very crispy and very thin. Just cheese, tomatoes, sausage, and fresh basil.  Pure, simple deliciousness. All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp.  I also purchased a chocolate croissant, chocolate scone, and a bag of LGO's famous English muffins to go. LGO's English muffins are amazing, and are  everything an English muffin should be. LGO's English muffins are soft and toast up perfectly for buttering. I don't recall ever having had an equal.  If your ever in the area, you should stop by and give LGO a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite pizzeria in Phoenix!  I always bring out of town friends here and they fall in love with it. My cousin drives up from Tucson to get an LGO fix way more often than she would probably care to admit.  =)    I've tried probably every pizza on the menu.  My absolute favorite is the roasted corn pizza with sausage added.  I have some leftovers in my fridge as I write this, in fact.  Mmmm!   That pizza just blows my mind every single time I order it!   The classic margherita pizza is always a hit too, it's just so fresh and made to perfection.  Order the roasted corn - add sausage if you're a meat eater and enjoy this little slice of heaven!   If you're thinking about an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the chip plate - the pimento dip is amazing - it just tastes like a cheese dip with a little kick/heat to it.  The guacamole is always so fresh and delicious too.  A favorite spot for guac.  I don't personally care for the salsa though, but I'm happy to leave that to others and go for the guacamole and pimento dip!    Stop by at the market for some delicious dessert on your way out.  Vegan apple cinnamon cookie is surprisingly great. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie can't be beaten.  Or get yourself some gelato or a cupcake, you can't go wrong.    Everyone will enjoy your meal here.  It's one of my favorite treats and how I love to show off Phoenix to visiting friends!   Great job LGO!!"}
{"text":"Ok at I'll admit to judging a book by its cover. Coming from LA and the moment I walk in, I see this sorority sisters/hipster scene unraveling before my eyes. I judged this place. HARD.  When I did eat the food though, even though the portions are smaller than what I would've liked, the margherita pizza was good. Not too oily. Slice was thin. Toppings tasted fresh. Would eat again.  Panini sandwiches were also good. Well toasted but not burnt. None of that sloppy dressing like chain sandwich shops. Everything was tidily kept in between the buns making it much more appetizing.  4/5 stars because the food was good, but it's too busy for the staff to explain to a newcomer what's going on in the store/restaurant. I wished they had informed me that I have to pick up the pizza myself on the other side of the restaurant instead of waiting over half an hour by the register where I picked up my sandwich."}
{"text":"This place really seems to have something delicious for everyone, just as my friend who suggested it promised.   Case in point, our table ordered: a whole chicken, a roasted corn pizza (vegetarian), a fish sandwich on lettuce with a salad (paleo), and a fish sandwich on bread.  For dessert, we tried the peanut butter pie and red velvet cake - both served with amazing gelato, made fresh.   Everything was super delicious - impressive flavors, not too heavy. The desserts were incredible. The service was really pleasant and the atmosphere is cute. We'll definitely be back soon!  The only downside was that the wine is pretty pricey by the glass. We solved this by ordering a $15 bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place!!! Their chicken wings are really good and they are not deep fried, so that's a plus in my book! They use a sourdough crust for their pizza. It's a really good unique flavor that I catch myself craving all the time. I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!! Ambience ***** Service ***** Taste ***** Mango chile Gelato - Oh God!! You should be blessed to eat this.  Ordered Dalai Lama Pizza and Avocado pizza - both the pizzas are really cooked to perfection. No too cheesy. I highly recommend this place.  Pizza Hut / Spinatos"}
{"text":"I tried the pizza here, and was kind of disappointed.  It wasn't bad, but based on the reviews and crowds, I expected much better.  Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"Do I really need to state all the ways LGO is amazing... Because it is. A long, long, time ago I moved into town and read a review to try the Roasted Corn pizza. Well a year and a half later - it is still my go to. The pizzas are made with a sour dough crust, and the freshest ingredients.. The corn is fresh, goat cheese, basil, mozzarella and I add avocado to the top.   I usually order from the grocery side and snag a bottle of wine too. I recently moved into Arcadia and have gotten to try their breakfast (love the oatmeal), salads and some of the fresh baked bread to take home.   Plus- you can pick up just about any little treasure Your heart desires. They have tons of books, candies, candles, home goods...the list goes on. This place is s gem and perfect for absolutely any type of mood you are in."}
{"text":"I'm going to up LGO one star because their management followed up with me and offered a gesture for the poor meal we had delivered.  I appreciated the customer service.  That said, after giving them a second try there was only moderate improvement in the pizza quality.  If you go here, I would avoid the pizza."}
{"text":"My fiance and I finally checked this place out after hearing so many amazing things about it from friends. There was a bit of a wait, but i think it was worth it, and chilling in the grocery was a perfect way to kill the time!  We shared a delicious salad, the orange fennel, and some ceviche, then had 2 pizzas so we'd be sure to have leftovers to take home. The salad was by far my favorite part of the meal. Absolutely perfect with mandarin oranges, fennel, goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette. To die for. The ceviche was refreshing and tasty and i really enjoyed the wild mushroom party pizza. Several different varieties of fungi, and again, more fennel. The Fallen Angel pizza was good, but i was not expecting the flavor of the sausage.   Overall, we were very impressed with the food and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Aside from a few soggy salad issues, really love the food and SANGRIA! Sitting in the bar is really pleasant and the bartenders do a great job in getting to know their locals. Definitely recommend any meal here and they know how to offer a happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went back the other day, Got 2 pizzas. Still fantastic. This place seems a bit more touristy then it use to, back when I use to go it was more of a local hangout. Seems it is mainstream now, Postino's next door and the new business in the area are definitely attracting more people. Still a great spot to go for great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Given its location and surroundings (Postino's, fancy little grocery, etc), LGO is surprisingly casual inside, which I actually enjoyed.  There seemed to be a decent selection of wine (sorry, I didn't pay attention to the beer list) and if they don't have what you want, you can grab a bottle at the grocery and drink that.  I had the sangria, but didn't really love it.  The pizza though, oi, so yummy.  We had just cheese and sausage, and it was delicious.  I was a little iffy ordering sausage as I'm pretty picky about it, but it was great.  Had I not been trying to be a little ladylike, I could see myself scarfing down most of a whole pizza.   I also have bumped LGO to the top of my list of good places to take out of town guests, especially pickier eaters.  Who doesn't love pizza?  Update:  The roasted corn pizza is FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"Pretty sure even if I wasn't  into eating food (roasted corn pizza is the most amazing pizza ever. Sorry Pizzaria  Bianca) I would come here just to hang out with Eric the bartender on the regular. Such a great time & provides awesome suggestions of things I would never try before. Chili Lime Tequila sour? Yes please! Love this little hidden bar on the southside of la grande orange. Love that u can just come into the bar without waiting in that long line & have a kick butt bartender at the same time. Come here if you want a good time or else go ahead with your lame existence!"}
{"text":"Great food and desserts. A tad bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients is very high. There are two parts to the restaurants the grocery and dine in. In the grocery they have some tables to can eat at as well. My mom and I split a salad and pizza which was plenty for us. Even had a few slices leftover. The crust on the pizza is great. The crust is crispy and I believe it may be of a sourdough base. Don't leave this place without grabbing a desert as well! The sea salt chocolate chip cookie was to die for."}
{"text":"There's just something about La Grande Orange Pizzeria.  No matter the valet, which is almost as annoying as a parking meter or garage. Now we have to pay a cover charge (as in, the tip to the valet), just to eat at your restaurant.  No matter the cramped quarters in the Grocery area, which is a major cluster during lunch time and horrible for claustrophobic people. The concept of a conjoined restaurant and market is so neat (see Olive + Ivy), but if it's disorganized, could fail miserably.  And no matter the single stall bathroom in a huge restaurant, or the fact you might have to wait over an hour for a table on a Friday night. The place's popularity was as strong as ever when I went there for dinner.  I've always enjoyed La Grande Orange's pizza, which, along with its extensive wine list, is one of its specialties.  This time around, my olive and avocado pizza ($17) was crispier than I prefer, but it was still really tasty-I ate a whole one myself, even though it serves two people! Still, I could name three spots quickly whose pizza I prefer over La Grande Orange.  I do also appreciate La Grande Orange for its open kitchen, though, which is always neat to see in a restaurant.  There were a couple things about the eatery that irk me, though, and make me feel like the spot is way overrated.  First, our party of 10 waited more than an hour to be sat, which was understandable because the place doesn't take reservations, but they really should for large parties since in other ways it's family-friendly-there were lots of screaming kids running around before we sat down. The restaurant was nice enough to serve us a pizza while we were waiting, though, which was unexpected and made the wait bearable-despite the fact there was no waiting area.  Yes, that's right-if you're waiting for a table (and you usually will), there is no designated waiting spot-you just sort of hover over other tables, which would be really awkward and annoying if I was sitting there.  When we were seated, though, the set-up was bizarre. Instead of putting us up in a big booth or pushing tables together, we were in a spot where separate tables were bolted to the ground, so our party wasn't even technically sitting together-we were at different spots.  For a place that isn't even that pretty or romantic or modern or stylish, I'm puzzled by its popularity, because I've had better pizza at countless places and have dined at spots with more attractive ambiance-all for far better deals. It must be the Arcadia neighborhood vortex that just draws people in, but I wish La Grande Orange was run more efficiently. Especially because it seems none of my friends have realized yet how not phenomenal it is, and I will accompany them again some time."}
{"text":"How is it possible that I haven't reviewed my love; LGO? Well, better late than never and that's definitely the case with this.   I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, but LGO is a classic gem in Phoenix. It's nestled among quaint houses full of character and as you walk in, you'll most likely see several beach cruisers parked along the building, waiting for their owners who take a morning bike ride to grab a bite to eat.   I visit LGO when I want to pretend that I'm in California or on the ocean, or in Europe or even if I want to forget that it's 100+ degrees outside. I visit LGO when I need to do work but want to get out of my normal routine. I can grab some food and set up shop at one of the several tables or booths, or even outside. Plus, I don't need to worry about my battery dying here, for they have several power outlets so I can keep my computer's juices flowing for hours.   The scene here is crazy, cool, relaxing and fun all at the same time. I'll see every type of Phoenician here and they all blend and vibe with each other like it's no big deal. The music is going, the kitchen is hustling with orders, people are chatting with old and new friends and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fill the air.   The food here is delicious. Where to even start? Well for starters, I'll touch upon the breakfast. If I'm feeling fatty and in a hurry, I'll opt for one of their delicious muffins. If I'm feeling healthy and in a hurry, I'll go for the yogurt, granola and fruit. And...if I'm feeling fatty and lazy, I'll order one of their delicious hot meals and sit there and enjoy it. Lunchtime is my favorite and it most likely has something to do with their food. I adore the tuna melt but I only order it on calorie-counting free days. I also like the tuna salad, and turkey stack sandwich. Anything on their menu is amazing. Now moving on to dinner. Yes friends, they serve the famous Chelsea's hamburger here, so I can fulfill my cravings without having to fight the Chelsea's crowds. Their pizza is for champions and delectable. The pizza kitchen doesn't open until four and goes until late hours in the night. It's a perfect spot for a casual yet tasty meal.   I will leave with a couple additional tidbits of fun facts. They sell the reusable plastic glasses that are trending up the city these days. While it's pricey on the front end ($12+), you can then fill it with coffee (even iced) or tea for I want to say just a dollar or two which isn't bad!   Craving LGO but can't find a space or better yet, too lazy to get out and walk in like I am half the time? Luckily the lazy fairies are watching over us for LGO offers some excellent curbside pick-up. I will call on my way there, drive in, park, they come right out, I give them my card, they grab the food, I pay, and I'm on my way. It's seamless and I love it... just like I love LGO as a whole. I wish they opened one walking distance to me."}
{"text":"The pizza (served after 4pm) is amazing. You can't beat the sourdough crust...and so much basil!! I love it so much. The adorable shop, kale and quinoa salad, and chocolate sea salt cookie is also amazing and would totally keep coming back. I'm holding back the fifth star because the breakfast is just so-so, and its always really crowded in there and they can't seem to figure out parking or a great spot to wait."}
{"text":"My very favorite stop for bringing our out of town friends!   I love the food and each visit I try something new to love!   To-die-for baked goods too!!!  The boutique/market is always full of fun gifts for giving (or keeping!)!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the neighborhood and decided to give this a try. I was really disappointed and hubby said it was okay.  We stood in a line that winds itself through a hip version of a Cracker Barrel lobby. The menu is written on chalkboards high above the register/bakery counter area. Because there is so much on the menu the words are difficult to read. When we got to the register we then came upon menu sheets. With a line of people waiting behind us I felt rushed to order.  The cheesecake we ordered to share was immediately handed to us so of course we ate as soon as we sat down. It was delicious! This is the only reason I am giving the restaurant two stars.  After a few minutes hubby's name was yelled. To get to the food was a journey through tables, around a long pub table (8 chairs long) down to the end of the bar.  We both ordered basic food. I had a cheeseburger with a pile of grated cheese that melted into a lump, a thin slice of pickle, and 2 of the worse excuses for tomato slices (honestly I would have been embarrassed to serve them). Hubby had the green chili cheeseburger which he proclaimed to be okay.   Our sides were Caesar salad (him) which was fresh and fries (me) which were cold and salty. The fries were so salty that they could have walked across the table and shook hands with the napkins I was using to wipe off my fingers. I gave up on my lunch after eating 1/3 of the burger and 5 of the fries.  We spent $38 for two sub par burgers, bottled drinks and a dessert to share. Should have gone to Freddy's - they call your number instead of yelling your name, have better food and cost a hell of a lot less."}
{"text":"Came here this past Friday with my wife and a some friends. Before I even get to the good, let me say that our waitress was absolutely fantastic! She knew every little detail about the menu and the wine and she answered every question that we had which was quite a few. On top of that, she also seemed super genuine and actually cared about providing quality service. This definitely made our experience even better. I believe that her name is Kristin or Christine. She was awesome. Now to the wine. They have some incredible wine bottle specials. Our party of four split a $14 bottle of wine which gave each of us a pretty generous glass and it made it super cheap for us to enjoy a great glass of wine with dinner. Probably some of the best bottled wine deals you will find in Phoenix. For dinner I ordered the mushroom pizza and added an egg to that. Super delicious. Plenty of mushrooms, good amount of cheese, and the egg on top made it. My wife and the couple that we were with got their specialty pizza with the figs and prosciutto and my wife thought it was just okay. Overall, great service and delicious pizza with cheap yet good quality wine. Gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Easy choice to make when I saw a pizza on LGOP's menu called the \"Gladiator\". Great pie with some good sausage and quality cheese! Just a cool spot in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place  There are nice veggie options. Would love to see some new vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"First off, make sure your entire party is on time! They won't seat you until everyone arrives (not a bad thing, just an FYI).  So I get why this place is rated so highly. It's super cute with a mostly great staff (our waitress wasn't particularly warm, but I'll cut her a little slack because she was kinda busy and we were a big group). They have an adorable market next door and it has a great cute but casual ambiance. And they have free wine tasting while you wait for a table! Awesome :) However, I had a couple complaints.  1) I ordered a glass of red wine to start, the Pinot Noir. We had a large party (11) for a friends birthday and so I thought it would be simpler to order a glass than finding various people to split a bottle. After perusing the wine selection in the market, I expected it to be at least decent. It was not. Very much not decent, actually. And it was served almost luke-warm. I'm not sure if anyone has had poor quality wine served luke-warm, but it's disgusting. Next time I'm either getting a bottle from the market or sticking to the sangria.  2) I ordered the roast corn pizza (HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED) which was great. One of my friends ordered a Margharita Pizza and added proscuitto. Her pizza came out sans proscuitto. The waitress was apologetic and she took it back but when it came out, it was as if the kitchen grabbed a handful of proscuitto, through it on, and called it good. It wasn't cooked with the pizza and seemed incredibly half-assed.  Overall it was fine - I'd be willing to give it another shot, but my experience has a few flaws."}
{"text":"Not a pizza person.  NOT-A-PIZZA-PERSON.  But our dining couple friends had heard good things about LGO and wanted to try it and I figured, okay, there will be something other than pizza...  Well, there really wasn't anything else that tickled my fancy, so I ended up ordering a pie.  All I can say is: wow!  Well, actually, first of all, we started off with salads.  One couple split a Caesar and the other a Caprese.  Fresh, delicious, yum!  THEN came the pies.  One set of us ordered a Margherita, the other a Margherita and a Gladiator, and the third couple a Gladiator and a Mother Earth.  Can I just say all pies were devoured?    I got the Mother Earth, which was loaded with green & black olives, artichokes, roasted peppers, broccolini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fennel, and onion.  The crust was very crispy and very thin---practically non-existent, just as I requested. Uctuous cheese was high quality.  Veggies just right.  But seriously, I traded off a slice for one of the Margherita, and that's what I would order next time.  Just cheese, tomatoes and fresh basil.  Pure, simple goodness.  I had a bite of DH's Gladiator---it was okay---I think I am maybe not a meat-lover-pizza person.  I was DD, so I had ice tea.  It wa a bit odd tasting.  On reflection, maybe it has a hint of orange-y flavor (La Grande ORANGE, after all)?  It was okay after I got used to the taste.  But I would like to have been warned.  First taste, I was like: Eeeew...Phoenix city water flavor?  Then I realized it was kind of a fruit-taste.  Except for never offering me a re-fill on my ice tea, our server, Madison was very good---attentive, personable, informative, and she's the one who made sure I got my practically crustless pizza!  Cute hair-cut too!  All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp!  Anyhow, I can see why LGO has 4.5 stars.  Very good.  If I were to trek south for pizza again---and I think that may happen, because everyone was so happy with their meals---I would probably do it for LGO."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great place for family and friends. Staff was super courteous and attentive. My favorite pizza was the gladiator, but many others to choose from with different veggies and others to support special dietary needs. The MUST try on the menu for me were the wings. As a wing fan, specially during football season, the wings were probably one of the best in the valley. Perfectly seasoned! Those wings will be hard to beat, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! you have to try the commuter with turkey and bacon pressed and if you're in the mood for pizza the gladiator is fantastic with Schriner sausage pepperoni and mozzarella"}
{"text":"LGO is one of my favs.  Amazing flavor whether ording pizza or any of their sandwhiches (like tuna filet) or salads.  Pizzas (available with both smokey chewy flour or glueten free crusts) are to die for...Mother Earth Vegan and Rocketman are my two favorites (both vegetarian).  English Muffins are really the best of anywhere...I never knew how good a soft, freshly backed muffin could be, as it just melts your pallet.    The only negative: parking is horrible (mainly since the place is so popular)...so use the free valet or go at mid-times.   Nontheless, the food and atmosphere more than make amends."}
{"text":"I have been in twice now and have tried four different pizzas. Each one was amazing in it's own way. Love the crust, the sauce, fresh ingredients. I will keep coming back for the pizza. Service is very good. The big stand out for me above and beyond was the pepperoni and sausage pizza, the Gladiator. This is my go to pizza combination when I want pizza. I simply can not remember having a better pepperoni and sausage pizza, ever. So simple, yet such great flavor. If you haven't been in to try a pizza here yet, start with this one. Eat it all and don't take any home unless it's in your belly. Yum. Have fun exploring next door in the little market too. Lots of cool things to discover and acquire."}
{"text":"Love it! I've been to LGO at the airport but I think this was my first time at this location. My family got food from the other part of the restaurant, but I went for the pizzeria. I got an avocado pizza which is amazing, though there was way too much basil on it. I took it off though! Avocado on a pizza is definitely a good choice, the lemon zest made it all even more delicious. I love the crust too. Atmosphere is nice too! It was a little crowded but not bad! It was clean too. Overall a great experience, I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I come here more for the grocery section than I do for the food.  Good place to grab something to go or a really lazy/low-key brunch.  The English Muffins are made in-house.  The french toast is great.  The rest of the stuff is good but not the best.  The grocery section has Tammie Coe cakes (really great coconut cupcake), and desserts galore.  They have lots of wine and fun books to ogle.  Next door is the Pizza which is tasty but a bit salty for my taste.  The crust doesn't stay chewy or crisp long enough for my taste.  It is convenient for takeout if you live close by.  It is however a great first date place, looks like you're cool and hip without trying too hard.  And if you run out of things to say you can head to the grocery or if the date is really bad you can say good night and just grab some gelato for yourself next door."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here regardless of the wait. Their pizzas I think is way better than Pizzeria Bianco. The restaurant is next to a market which is good if you are waiting for your seat. This place is good for large groups and their food is amazing! Whatever you order on the menu I don't think you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're lucky enough to come here and be served by Kaity, consider yourself fortunate - she's one of the best reasons to visit this establishment.  They have a cutesy market, great coffee and lots of draft beer choices on tap.  In addition, their margherita pizza is up there in the top five Phoenix has to offer.  Fresh ingredients and great service = I'll keep coming back as long as we can be waited on by the lovely Kaity!  *side note, it's fun to say LGO"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood spot in all of Phoenix. I go here at least every day and sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times!! Whether it's for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, desert, or a fun trinket or gift you will find everything you need. The food is absolutely incredible and I have never had something I didn't love! We even get our Thanksgiving dinner from LGO!  Not to mention all other Lgo Restaurants are incredible!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Town. I live in North Scottsdale and every time I'm in the are I Need to stop in and get a gluten free cookie. It's the best!   In addition to the cookie, please go and try the (I don't exactly know the name of theses pizza but they will know which one when you order) Kale Salad, Mushroom Pizza, Goat Cheese with Corn Pizza, and the White Sangria!!"}
{"text":"Well let me tell you about this little \"posh\" place called LGO.   Let me just first clear the air here. Yes I am the Duke of this location (temporarily of course). Have I been to LGO 20+ times, no. Is my house close enough so I can just check in during the morning and evening if I feel like it, yes. Do I just do this to annoy my friends who are all about \"Check-Ins,\" yes. Is it dishonest, yes. Is it distasteful, yes. Do I care, no. Is this review going to have bad grammar and punctuation, yes.  Now lets get back to LGO. When you first walk into LGO, you might get a little overwhelmed. Boy you will definitely get overwhelmed. They have options galore. So many options. It's almost too much of a variety. I mean they have mothers and daughters and highschoolers and college girls and Divorced women and desperate women and the list goes on and on.   The mothers stop in for some lunch after their Village workout on a Tuesday afternoon because honestly, don't you go to LGO after your Village workout on a Tuesdsay afternoon? What kind of jobs do these women do to allow them such a luxurious lifestyle? I'm just kidding, we all know what kind of jobs they do, the jobs that begin with an \"H\" or a \"B\" thats for sure.  But fellows, if you come here on the weekend be ready to get into a pissing contest with the elites around you. Two weekends ago I saw a Fararri parked next to a Lamborghini (I have no idea if those are spelled right, sue me for not being of the people who feel spaghetti and meatballs should be served three meals a day). But all is good at LGO.  These are the exact reasons why everyone should come here. I've been told they serve food. But between the fancy cars and the sexually determined women, who has time to eat?"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite favorites, and worth the 45 minute drive.  Their pizzas are incredible, I love their sourdough crust.  The dessert choices are dynamite!  Be prepared for a busy busy restaurant and lame parking options."}
{"text":"I come here often to get my daughter chocolate chip sea salt cookies because she's obsessed with them. They also have the best gift shop- I know I can come here if I ever need a quick birthday gift! Pro tip- do curb side pick up and call ahead. This place can get super busy and no one likes to wait in a long line.   Also their wine selection is top notch!"}
{"text":"This was my fiancé and my first time here (we are from CA) and I can tell you it won't be our last! The service was amazing and the food was even better. Our wonderful server Kenzie was super sweet, gave us impeccable service and wonderful recommendations. We got the wings (which are the best wings we have ever had), the gladiator pizza and the white sangria. Definitely a great place to go for date night or just to hang out with family or friends. I also would like to mention we came about 7pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately which I was surprised about since the place looked pretty busy. The parking lot is also a little small but we got lucky and found a good parking spot in front. Overall I would give it a 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast, their pizza, the shopping, the wine selection, the music... basically everything.    Why not 5 stars?  It's a bit too California.  Scottsdale moms roll up in their Benz with full make-up, diamonds, everything... from the neck up, they look like they're going clubbing.  But then they ALL wear work out clothes like they've just jogged there.  They are going for the LOOK like they just hiked Camelback.  Does this bother anyone else or is it just me?"}
{"text":"A ten!!!!!!!! That is all that needs to be said. Or in Yelp world, a solid five. The family ordered the gladiator and avocado pies and both were awesome. The buttery sourdough (I am guessing) crust was amazing. We loved every bite and will go back again and again. Wish it was close to my house but worth the drive. The price for the pies was well within reason. A perfect meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in the city! The pizza is bomb! The beer is awesome! The wait staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"what is there to be said that hasn't already been?  try their sea salt choc chip cookies. with coffee or milk.   get all the FREE toppings on your pizza that you like! (egg? garlic? chilies!??!?!)   my fave? the roasted corn with goat cheese. put an egg on it!"}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place - a lot, since so many people I know seem to love it.  But much like many other trendy wanna-be higher end joints, I think the average upper-middle class customer base wants to like it so much they don't care how they are treated.  I however, am not blinded by overpriced food and nifty decor.  This place is chaotic, overpriced and unfortunately has pretty decent food regardless. Super snobby hipster or sorority girl staff - not just one or two, but MOST OF THEM. I failed to meet one friendly person working there any time I have been in.  I registered on Yelp simply to leave this review.  Going in at 3pm-ish is kinda a bad idea since they are in the middle of shifting from lunch to dinner set-up and no-one wants to help you.  You still have to order at the counter...my go-to is the pretty darned decent (but messy) veggie burger.  But that is all you get - no chips or anything.  Its enough but don't expect fancy.  So yesterday we go in for my honey's birthday.  We both order the veggie burger.  We were the only ones eating in the place, but other patrons were hanging out finishing up or studying with desert.    First, they are already clearing the tables and setting for dinner.  No biggy right.  Problem is they take all the napkin dispensers off the tables and replace with place settings.  Great.  But people still come in to eat during this time.  So, no tables had napkins. I ask the guy doing the settings if we could get a napkin.  He ignores me.  I chock it up to not hearing me.  A few minutes go by, still no food, still no napkins.  So I get up and go ask the guy (same guy that ignored me) who is standing in front of a huge basket of cloth dinner napkins if we could get a couple. His response - NO! and that I needed to go find a napkin dispenser....!! say what?! last time I checked I wasn't on the payroll. And Seriously dude!  I am not good enough for a cloth napkin 2 inches from your face after you removed all the paper napkins available?  Needless to say I myself had to go hunt down the last table that had a dispenser on it - outside.  After a very long wait, and much needed napkins in hand,  we finally get our burgers.  Great.  We take them to the table and my honey decides its a little bland and want mustard. She goes back up front and was told point-blank that if she had wanted mustard she should have ordered it and the only one that could give her mustard was the person calling out the food order - who was no longer around. Soooo, in an effort to be the better person we chose not to make a scene over mustard. Are you kidding me?  You can't turn around to the guy in the kitchen standing a foot away from you and say hey dude, can you hand me the mustard for a customer....NOPE!  We were freaking refused MUSTARD!   And again, this was on my honeys birthday.  We chose to spend part of our special day here and not, one, not two, but every single staffer was rude on some level.  We decided not to get coffee and dessert and chose to spend our money elsewhere.    I am a customer service freak and the times I had been here before were so busy I couldn't tell if it was me being stressed by the environment, or if the customer service sucked! I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt, but now that I have been here without it being busy at all, I know it is just the ATTITUDE of this place. We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I was hankering for a good burger and hit up LGO.  I remembered them from the Scottsdale Burger Battle event a few years ago and decided to come here for lunch on Sunday.  Let me tell you, the place was packed.  The line to order moved quickly and I sat at the bar and watched football until my order was ready.  The green chile burger was amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and the green chiles had just the right amount of heat.  I usually just eat half of a big burger and take the rest home when I go out but I wolfed this burger down in one sitting.  The ordering process and waiting for them to call your name when the food is ready is a little cumbersome.  Parking can also be a challenge."}
{"text":"The owner isn't very nice and not very social. I seen him being not so nice to an employee which made me feel very uncomfortable, and made me not want to support his business. The music is very loud. The parking is almost impossible. You're bumping into everything just to order, walk to get your coffee, wait for your food to be called and hope you hear it over the music. The flow is just horrible. On the other hand, the food is good, the chefs seem to be very fast with good quality outcome. Things are a bit over priced, and some of the customers are rude. But that's probably out of their hands. It's a place that is cool to try and has some different food menu items. But something about it rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"have gone there a lot...most recent visit however was less than stellar...had my usual ruben...really have liked that sandwich...but this time..the ingredients were of poor quality...fatty fatty meat and tough...the goodies with it had a different flavor and kind of bland...the service...wow...down the can..rude, rude, rude people taking orders. Need to work on that a bunch."}
{"text":"Awesome service, thanks Erik! Had the grilled artichoke and ceviche to start. Artichoke was really good! Ceviche was ceviche, not amazing. Went with half n half mother earth and fallen angel. The crust was great and the grilled veggies on the mother earth side were awesome, highly recommend. Happy hour drinks are a great deal, Lemonade vodka something or other drink was good but draft wine was yucky, but that's just me. Obviously people like it or they wouldn't serve it, I just didn't. Don't get me wrong, I still finished it, no glass of wine gets left behind."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for LGO from the hype I've heard from friends about it - this pizzeria definitely did not disappoint! The ambiance is great (we were seated right away during a busy weeknight happy hour), and though it's packed and loud, you can comfortably converse with your party. The only reason it's not a 5 for me is because of our server - she barely checked in on us and we had to wave her down to order, and again for the check.   But on to the food...amazing!!! One of the best pizzas I've ever had - they use a distinct sour dough (not sure if that's actually what it is, but that's what it tastes like) crust that's right in-between crunchy flat crust and fluffy regular pizza. The toppings are fresh, and LGO offers an outrageous selection of really great specialties with amazing topping pairings!   They also have alcoholic kombucha at the bar, which is super cool - I had a Kombucha mule and it was great. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best pizza I have ever had! The chips and dip are also so delicious!  Customer service in this place is great!!! Sharon took great care of us today...thank you!"}
{"text":"I have a wonderful love/hate relationship with LGO.   You know when you have a friend who is just...difficult but awesome? You know that it is going to be a bit of a challenge to get together with him/her, and they might give you a hard time? But once you do get settled in, all is well and your friend is awesome?   So that's where I am with LGO. I have been coming here for 4 years or so, and the parking always sucks (as previously mentioned) and the lines are always long (also previously mentioned). I suppose its impressive that this place is so packed all the time....but based on the food, it's not surprising.  The food is awesome- particularly the pizzas and the commuter sandwich. Also they have some of the best prepackaged salads I have ever had....I'm not even a salad girl! Overall, LGO is a place with character, entertainment, and great food.   One more thing is the size- during the lunch/dinner rush it is particularly difficult for those in wheelchairs to manuever the room. Last year I scheduled a meeting with several colleagues, and one who was in a wheelchair had a very hard time- we had to ask another group to switch with us so she could get up to the table. I'm quite certain it was pretty embarassing for her."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and HH with a friend, after hearing nothing but raving reviews about LGO! I actually drove past it the first time but was able to find it after a quick U-turn (legally of course!). The market is lovely with all kinds of things to look at, the bakery was stocked full of yummy goodies and breads galore! We were seated in the dining room and our waitress was very sweet and attentive.   After looking at the menu's, we noticed there wasn't much of a HH (only 2 wines for $5, $1 off cocktails and $2 beers). My friend and I ordered Sangria (OK I had 2) and thought it was quite tasty and full of fruit to nibble on afterwards. We split the smoked salmon salad, which was amazing! Perfect amount to split with someone because we also ordered the roasted corn pizza. Wow, the pizza was so good! I didn't think corn in a pizza would taste this good but it really does, as it was layered underneath the cheese and sourdough pie! Since we saw all the amazing bakery items beforehand, we had to order the Smore's cupcake (to split!). It was also incredible and rich, glad we split it!   I had a really great time and will be back! Delish!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and great food! We came here on recommendation from others and it's now our go to pizza and wing place. We enjoyed the cozy corner restaurant.   They had many different types of pizza combinations that you wouldn't find in your average pizza place, and they were really good. Our favorite thing had to be the wings. They are baked and not deep fried which made the taste that much better. The sauce they use isn't your average buffalo sauce. It has a little bit of a sweetness to it which was really good.  We will definitely be coming back soon, if not just for the wings!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday last year. We had a large party, but had called ahead so we did not wait for a table (score!). It was packed.   The food is pretty good here. Not bad, but nothing outstanding. My main complaint is with the service. Very slow, inattentive.... for a place that comes so highly recommended ...I think the staff feels they don't have to try very hard and it shows. We ordered a pitcher of the \"Shakin' Lemondade\" and we ASKED our waitress ahead of time how many glasses we could get out of it. I think she said 5 or 6. NO WAY. It came, she put the glasses down and started pouring...MAYBE 4 of us got enough lemonade. When one of us said, \"Oh I thought you said this would be enough...?\" She rudely said, \"Oh you'll need another pitcher for all of you\". That's why we asked first, honey. It was a very good drink but NOT worth the price tag.   I am just over these douche-y, pretentious Phoenix restaurants that have crappy service but get away with it just because of the name of the place. We're in Phoenix, not New York City. Get over yourselves."}
{"text":"This place is groooovy!!  We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was slightly busy and kind of confusing. You order your food at the counter and then find a seat after they call your name out (during the day, not sure about the evening). We order the margarita pizza and it was bomb! Our friend has the BLT and it looked pretty good....she had no complaints. I had the potato salad and it was freaking delicious. Maybe I was smitten by the groovy atmosphere, but I love this joint."}
{"text":"Whoa - I went to update my review of LGO Grocery (one of my favorite gems in the Valley), only to pull up this listing and see that I have never reviewed the pizzeria.  That is crazy talk... I've only been frequenting this pizzeria at least once a month for the last ten or so years ;)  Whether you dine in or take out, this place is great.  I'm going with five fabulous stars for this one, and here are my top five reasons why:  1 - consistency... I've never had a bad meal at LGO Pizzeria 2 - service... friendly and attentive when you dine in and who doesn't love the option for curbside pick-up when taking out?! 3 - kid-friendly.  even for two picky toddlers that don't usually sit still.  My kids love LGO pizza! 4 - vibe.  there is always an awesome energy at this place and great music too! 5 - comfortable and casual - no need to dress to impress here... come in your sweats or workout clothes or dress up if you please.  you'll be comfortable no matter what; especially if you score a booth seat!  So there you have it.  If you're in the mood for pizza, salad, or even wings, a burger, a glass (or bottle) of wine, or some amazing baked goods or gelato,  you can't go wrong with this place!  Make sure to visit the grocery / retail shop nextdoor when you go as well :)"}
{"text":"Decided to come back despite a not so pleasant prior visit. I'm glad I did! Outstanding food and service. I can't wait to come back. Try their avocado and prosciutto pizza!"}
{"text":"Was my first time ever visiting this place. We were greeted by Lindsey. Very polite and great customer service. Lindsey answered all of our questions and had an amazing first experience. Greg food and great drinks. Food came out hot and a very reasonable time. Very nice environment, would definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Commuter breakfast sandwich is amazing!!!! LGO is a very cute place! The food taste good and is quality!!! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because it is a little pricey ($9 for the commuter sandwich)"}
{"text":"So Millsie, my bestie, talked.... yapped.... meowed.... (and at times - barked) about how DEEEE-LISH this place is.  Whell.... i-t 'is.'  Not only is \"LGO's\" menu garden fresh but the atmosphere is hip yet cozy.  Parking can be a bitch.... but it's worth the irritation.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We've been for take-out, lunch, dinner, and coffee meet-ups. Just had some take out again last night. This place is great. What I like most is the fact that they have pre-made stuff, so you can grab and go if you are in a rush. Desserts there are also great.   I would say one thing they could improve on is making the grocery store part a like less cluttered. Don't bring your stroller in there! It's too hard to navigate around without knocking into stuff!"}
{"text":"As promised, this place is amazing, it can get crowded but other than that it's pretty hard to beat"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday, but should warn you, it's not the typical LGO experience I'm used to. No table service in the restaurant seating area and nobody tells you that when you walk in. We sat at a table for a good 5 minutes, unknowing, while one of their employees misted us with window cleaner while cleaning the door behind us. We eventually asked, learned, and moved to the bar where they do have full service.   The full menu is not available, but they still serve pizzas and salads. The salads, however, will come in a t-go box (ugh). Unfortunately, we didn't consider how uncomfortable it would be to eat two salads and a pizza on a table that is really meant for holding cocktails. Note to self- do not sit in the bar if you are ordering food here.   So how was the food? I love the kale and quinoa salad- I get it every time I travel through terminal 4 (just don't want a to-go box when I'm in a restaurant). B liked the date and beet salad. We tried the vegan pizza- it had a good amount of toppings and I liked the cashew cheese, but the crust wasn't as good as I remember from this place.  Overall- fine, but don't know that we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cluster***** Here's the scoop - I really like LGO's food, but the concept can be incredibly frustrating for a few reasons listed below.   - Parking is insane. Yes, they added valet, but it's usually five cars deep to pull off. Also, even if you want to temporarily park in one of their To Go parking spots, it's congested to the point where I've driven away out of annoyance. Not a good sign, when your customers who actually really want to eat there will drive away out of frustration.   - The line to order. Seriously guys, can't you just have table service!? To be fair, they DO have full service in the restaurant during dinner, but for lunch and breakfast (when they are generally most busy) you have to wait in line between tables and shelves overflowing with expensive knickknacks just to order your meal.   - Now after your order, you have to wait around AGAIN to pick up your food at a separate area, shoved in the corner where there are constant staff members leaving and entering the kitchen, the coffee bar, and more shelves filled with trinkets all smashed together with hungry customers waiting for their food. Ugh. Hate to sound like I'm just complaining here, but TRUST ME, it's obnoxious.   If you do visit, go for dinner service only, where you can enjoy your meal as a server will wait on you.   Now on the bright side, their chocolate walnut cookie and chocolate pudding is to die for. Also, I love the avocado pizza - Be sure to add prosciutto."}
{"text":"One of those places I really meant to get to for a long time.  Got the chance the other evening for an after party. Only real negative: pretty much forced valet, complimentary other than the tip.  No trouble getting seated right about dinner time on a Thursday, they were busy our whole time there. Wile not right at our side the whole time I thought the service was pretty good, and pleasant.  I got a sample of my first choice of beer and glad I didn't go that route but the waitress listened to my comments and made a suggestion which was very good. I had a really good tasting cheeseburger with a side salad. Two of our party shared a pizza and I didn't hear any complaints."}
{"text":"What a find! I went here expecting to order a salad and was pleasantly surprised by the GLUTEN FREE PIZZA sign on the door. Yippee!!  The pizza was excellent (and that is not easy to do with gluten free)! I also loved the fennel salad.   It was so nice to have the shop right there, we bought a bottle of wine and they were happy to just add it to our dinner bill rather than making two payments.   We had outstanding service and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. I am traveling to Phoenix again this fall and this will be a must visit restaurant."}
{"text":"LGO - I am in love with you!  First, you wow me with breakfast (your muffins melt me).  Then your drinks and sweets.  I finally had time to try your pizza.  Why didn't I come sooner?  Boy, I was missing out.  I got the gladiator pizza.  It was very good:  thin crust, crust was tasty, cheese was so flavorful, the sausage was full of flavors too, and there was pepperoni hiding between the crust and the cheese.  The cheese pizza was great too.  My mouth and tummy was a happy camper.    Why 4 stars?  The service.  It was slow, had to ask for refills, and just painfully to get your server's attention.  The place can get a little loud!"}
{"text":"Fast easy convenient and full of life!  The pizza is light and full of flavor.  I love the Kale and Quinoa salad."}
{"text":"I had been coming here since it seems like 2003 or so and for 4 years or so had been consistently delighted with the food - they were always too-crowded and service/wait times consistently showed that strain.   I've stopped coming here - preparation and ingredient quality have diminished steadily since late 2007 and crossed a boundary for me by November 2008"}
{"text":"Great, hip place....Moroccan mint tea is to die for!!!  Location is walking distance from my home, pet friendly and friendly service. Usually packed on weekend mornings so be prepared for a short wait but other than that, I can't complain!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. This week went for my second time first for breakfast and this time for dinner and again the food is just deliciuous. Now they have a full bar, my margarita was excellent. loved the service. I felt like i was in NYC for a moment."}
{"text":"I love love La Grande Orange, but I absolutely cannot give them 5 stars! Their parking is a nightmare! Not only is valet parking a turn off, but it is still not convenient here and the attendants are rather rude considering you are their customer. I have tried to visit at off times and the parking is always the gripe.   There's just something that goes against my grain to pay to go out to dinner only to be forced into paying for parking. I'm used to most places that if you spend say $25 or so, they offer free parking. Yes there is a small pick up free parking area, but it is always full and trust me I've tried for 20 minutes before to get parking there - not going to happen.   The pizza is delicious and probably my second favorite in the valley to Pizzeria Bianco. The appetizers are delicious and the little grocery and gift shop next door is fun.   I would come here a LOT more if they came up with a better parking solution, but every time I think of that parking lot.. my thoughts are.. I'll try somewhere new.   The pizza crust has a perfect texture, and is nearly a sourdough base. We tried The Fallen Angel which is out of this world - the housemade sausage makes it along with the shaved fennel.   We tried their Pizzeria Chop Salad which was out of this world, another dish I would order again. They also do an amazing grilled artichoke which is delightfully executed.   For dessert we headed on next door!"}
{"text":"i cant review restaurants in phx and leave out LGO. breakfast, coffee ambiance, service, pizza - 5 stars. happy hour 3 stars. Not very many places beat this place out for saturday or sunday morning coffee and or breakfast after a nice wrkout, run, hike or... anything else at home in bed with your better half. must see for my visitors"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The service is always fast and efficient. The pizza is served fresh and hot. The menu selection offers many choices. I think my most favorite thing is the price of the wine. It is extremely reasonable. Seriously the cost of a bottle of wine is the same amount that many restaurants charge for a glass. Plus it's in Arcadia. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First time here and experienced a few mishaps. Wrong drinks being delivered and a pizza not being placed to order. Ended up getting a comped drink and pizza though. I appreciate them fixing the situation.   I like the overall vibe of this place and of course, the food is fantastic. My only complaint with the overall place is that people turn their lights off as they're pulling away from the windows. Bright shiny car lights right in my eyes is not the business."}
{"text":"I love LGO everytime I get breakfast or lunch here I always have to go home with a bag of English Muffins they're the best here. If they could change anything they should do burgers for lunch and not start them at 4 pm. Great burgers and end it with a salted chocolate chip cookie"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and I really like the pizza and salads. I have also been here for breakfast as well and that doesn't disappoint either. I always see everyone I know there as it is close to a lot of friends I know as well. Great hangout spot to grab coffee food and or to people watch as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this pizza! The atmosphere and small store were equally as lovely!   Positives: We stopped in here and weren't sure what to get or expect. We ended up ordering our pizza to go and hung around the unique shop while waiting. We enjoyed looking through all the fun things in this shop! We must remember to go back here for stocking stuffers.  We got the avocado pizza and the gladiator pizza. Both were AMAZINGGGGGGGG. Yes it deserved that many G's. Bomb.com as my teenagers would say. Stop in, give it a try. They also have an eat in pizzeria.   Negatives: None!"}
{"text":"O my goodness. This pizza is just too good. Only thing that truly sucks is how far it is away from me. This is one place I feel absolute confidence in telling people to go there and know they will enjoy all of it. The crust and toppings are top notch. I will always make my way out here when craving great pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast.  The energy is great and the staff is friendly.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go there but I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice place to try some local pizza place, and found this on yelp.  Its a nice little setup where theres a small store next door.  We were just wanting to try some options, so we opted for the mushroom party and the gladiator as options for our one pizza.  What can we say but yummerific.  Very nice and light dough.  It was airy and the flavors were spot on.  They did not bury the pizza with pounds of tops, but allowed one to enjoy the entire flavor of the pizza itself.    Definitely would recommend this local spot to try.  It has an ambiance about it that makes it feel very causal, and you can hang out and lounge.  The only downside is their alcohol selection in that not much to choose from.    If your in the area, surely stop by and try their pizza, its not huge in portion, but good in flavor and that sometimes is just as good."}
{"text":"There are some pizzas that can be made vegan. The avocado appears to be not one of them. A cracker with some lemon zest, avocado, tomato and basil. All for $14. And it's not good. At all.   Also, the most un-friendly employee award goes to the cashiers at LGO. You either have to be a jerk to them for them to tone it down or get nothing but a \"too cool\" attitude. It's quite interesting."}
{"text":"Dear LGO, I may have yelped too soon with my first review.  I know you can't control the \"angry birds\" that are in your patio, but you can try to control customer perceptions and satisfaction.  And of course that's what you did.  You tried to make it right and I came back with a more pleasant experience.    Second time around: We scored an awesome parking spot in the front, there were seats inside, and the food was pretty good.  The hot-pressed tuna had too much pepper, but the desserts were oh-so-good.  You are the example of what other small businesses should strive for - customer satisfaction. Thank you for taking the time to make me a fan."}
{"text":"Holy christ on a cracker, I've been coming here for 3 years now and am absolutely in LOVE with this place. My favorite is the Avocado Pizza ($14) and I like to add prosciutto ($3) to it for a little extra flavor. It's thin crust, no sauce and made with asiago cheese(yummm) It's a good size to eat by yourself if you want to take some home, or it's perfect to share for two people. They also have great specials on pitchers of sangria and some sort of vodka lemonade from what I remember.   Be sure to check out their grocery area and the gelato shop next door as well. I'd suggest to call ahead and make reservations since it's usually pretty crowded after 5 or 6pm."}
{"text":"I feel like an East Coast gangster when I roll up to LGO for breakfast. I'll take the Jersey Girl... pump fist and hair toss!! Hands down, it's the BEST omelette I've EVER had. And the fresh-squeezed OJ hits the spot.   After a hike at Camelback, it's relaxing to come and sit on the patio... if you can find a spot. Weekends this place is a zoo!! During the week is pretty crazy but has its peaks.   The French Toast is pretty tasty and they do pastries just right. Muffins are baked fresh, toast is always spot on perfect. I want their toaster!  I've had the pizza, which is pretty decent but not the best I've eaten. The salads are delish."}
{"text":"Even though I absolutely love food, I'm a very picky eater. I can easily say that this is my favorite restaurant in AZ. I ate at LGO at least 25-30 times and I was never disappointed, not even once. Their coffee is great (Havana latte), their wings ate awesome, their Green Chilly burger is out of this world!!! It won the best burger in AZ award few years ago. Their pizzas are amazing......I usually get \"the gladiator\" with avocado, prosciutto and spinach added!!!!! Man I'm telling you, it's insanely delicious. Their gelato and other deserts are awesome too. Large drink variety and it is reasonably priced. This place is awesome. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"So bummed they got rid of their reverse happy hour! I loved walking there after 9 just for a drink. The sangria pitcher is a great bargain but don't expect to share it between two people unless you want to be carried out. Their food is really hit or miss but their desserts are good. If you need to be awake for a week or are interested in having a heart attack you should try their cold brew coffee; it is the strongest coffee I have ever had. The employees on the dinner/table side are really nice but the employees on the store/carry out side usually aren't as friendly. The bartenders in the bar are really nice and prompt."}
{"text":"came for lunch on a Saturday, they were kind of busy but not packed. We had a crape, 3 pizzas and a burger with fries. My sister had the strawberry crape which was pretty good. the peperoni pizza my hubby and my sister had were Okay... Ive had way better. The crust was good but the cheese or sauce wasn't that tasty. Lets just say i would not come back for the pizza. I got the cheeseburger with fries, the fries were great and the burger was okay again. it was tasty but very plain. I would not come here for a burger either. Next time i think ill try a sandwich or one of the breakfast items. Their desserts look very tasty. we had a sample of the red velvet cake and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This is THE best pizza I've had!!  Been to Lombardi's in NY and it doesn't compare.  The dough is thin, crispy and chewy!!  I can't wait to go back to AZ to get me some pizza!!  If you're looking for a \"good ol boys\" pizza place with pitchers of beer,  unlimited amount of soda, dark wood and dart boards..... this isn't the place.    I went during happy hour and got the white sangria. Lots of nice big chunks of fruit and you can hardly taste the alcohol..... It's one of those drinks that will get you messed up because it taste like fruit juice and you'll have another and another and another!!  Had the baked chicken wings. They were juicy and had homemade blue cheese dressing.... OMG!!!  Pizza - had half Gladiator and half Classic margherita.  I'm still thinking about it.  I miss it SO!  Red Velvet cake - It didn't taste like the typical.  A little less sweet but it was scrumptious!  I want another piece!!  The parking is really bad... so get here early."}
{"text":"My first experience @ LGO was w/much in trepidation.  I was a little intimidated.  My husband and I just drove from the Renaissance Faire and we're a little \"dusty\"  we didn't have one problem parking.  We walked up and put our name in and 10 minutes later we were sitting @ one of those cute tables in the very front of the restaurant for two people only.  Right by the window.  Our waitress was so uber.  She was so attentive and put all of my intimidation to rest.    We got the small order of chicken wings.  I read the description but this doesn't do it justice.  My husband hates onions and doesn't mind the chive ridden dipping sauce @ all.  We ordered the Gladiator.  Pepperoni and Sausage.  Delish.  It was so good.  Next time we will add mushrooms.  Everything was A+.  Even the Diet coke in a can delivered to our table was fantastically cold."}
{"text":"HOLY PIZZA. This is the place for vegetarian pizzas- who knew broccolini would be an amazing topping?? Well, it is. LGO uses sourdough crust and piles on delicious and very creative toppings. The summer corn/ basil and rocket man (sun dried tomatoes, broccolini, etc) are perfection. The wine/ beer and drink list is also great, and I love that they have a locally grown vegetable side dish/ appetizer.  It's kind of loud in the restaurant, so be prepared for that, but it works. Service is friendly and quick, but if you have to wait for a table, make sure you explore the adjoining market!"}
{"text":"Adorable market that has great basic foods for breakfast and lunch. Also cute gift options displayed nicely for viewing! Was disappointed that portion of avocado toast was so small but did still enjoy the meal"}
{"text":"Parking seems crazy, but I always find a spot after a few minutes, they keep the flow moving nicely during the lunch hours.    I love this place.  From the little coffee bar, to the delicious gourmet sandwiches, from the sweet gifts you can look over while waiting in line, to the sweet deserts behind the counter.    My personal favorite, (being someone who doesn't cook nor eat fast food) is the curb side take out.  After a long day at the office, I call in my favorite Kale Salad, drive into the parking lot and pay as if I just went through a drive-through, but am rewarded with a gourmet salad.  Perfect fast-healthy dinner."}
{"text":"My only complaint: You can't make a reservation, so it can take a while to get seated especially with a larger party. My favorite pizza is the avocado prosciutto, it's just the right combination of salty and creamy. The pizza dough consistency is great too.  They have some great salads too. The best (in my opinion) is the one with kale and quinoa (can't remember what it's called). So good. They have complimentary valet parking, so remember to bring a couple dollars in cash to tip them. They also have parking in front, but it's usually packed."}
{"text":"Best place, BEST pizza in the valley!!! Everything is so good!!!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves LGO. Well, almost everyone. I see a few one and two star nuts in the mix.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.  Last night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.  After dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot."}
{"text":"Ok this USED to be our favorite neighborhood location but recently they've changed their Hh cocktails and removed the favorites to only have house wine and 3 bar cocktails!   They removed good nite Emily and lime lite!!! Are you kidding???  I don't understand what is going on??? Bring the other cocktails back so we can keep coming back to our favorite place or we are gonna have to be out....  very disappointed....  still great service."}
{"text":"Love their Pizzas, The Avocado pizza and the mushroom party are my fave! Love the Caesar salad , yummy California rolls, love the grocery side too.  Downside is no waiter service until after 4pm!  You also can't order pizza during the week until after 4pm!  Parking is a nightmare and they are always very busy.   My biggest complaint would be when my family and I had went there to celebrate mothers day (not on actual mothers day) one year and they did not want us to move a couple of tables together, they expected us to all sit at separate tables...WTF.....I mean they really put up a fight over this  BUT, Of course I was not having that, and moved them anyway....I've noticed since then they have welded the tables to the ground and you CANNOT move them, so if you are going with more than 4 people it really sucks!  I do Love the food so I will suffer serving myself and having to put up with the mobs on the weekend to enjoy a pizza for lunch.  I had to take away a star because it's really inconvenient to go there even if the food is divine."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place in food alone it would be 5-stars hands down.  The kale salad with rotisserie chicken is worth driving long distances for!  And ever single pizza is amazing thanks to that sourdough crust!   However, last Sunday, we experienced literally the worst service we've had (almost ever) at a restaurant.  Truly the service makes a place and even if the food is excellent, if the service is bad it's just not worth it.  Too many other good restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of this sourdough pizza crust! Haven't had a bad slice yet, but Avocado has been our go to.   Great spot to pick up dinner on the way home from the office... even if it means having to sit at the bar and finish a beer while you wait."}
{"text":"Great concept with great pizza in a great location with great service.  Parking is not soo great but hey something has to give.  Their Sangria is good and I love the good vibe feel of this place.  Why wait for hours at Pizza Bianca when you can just come here?"}
{"text":"Neighborhood doesn't get much better than this. Great service in a store like environment. I ordered a great pizza, sugar free vanilla latte, and some iced tea. Their tea was wonderful! The pizza... I couldn't get enough. My girlfriend ordered a turkey sandwich and also the tea. Fact is, I ordered the tea after I saw her order. I had to get some of that.   What is great about this place is, it is local, fresh, healthy... and they have wifi. Bring your laptop and get some work done over a pizza and sangria on those late night work nights. Their white sangria looks wonderful. I plan to go back for just that!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but over priced! Beer was 5 bucks during happy hour c'mon! If it were next to Oreganos I would go to Oreganos everytime."}
{"text":"Broccolini, spicy peppers, and thin crust pizza. You combine three of my favorite things and you get the Rocket Man. So very good. LGO manages to keep its wood fired crusts substantial and bready, yet never, ever flaccid (unlike other so-called wood fired pizza joints *ahem*Bianco*cough*Cibo).   I'm knocking off a star because the place is always yuppie pandemonium, and you have to watch your ass in the parking lot because it's full of Range Rovers driven by women who don't know how to maneuver a large vehicle. But, they get part of that star back for the adjacent gelato shop. Perfection."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna sandwich I wrote about in my last review is no longer offered here.   However, I still really enjoy this place even if they're so busy.   I recently tried 3 of their cupcakes and were surprised that they were so good. Their cupcakes look like the cupcakes that just look good but don't necessarily taste good. I was wrong. They were DELICIOUS. I also tried their key lime pie, which had a little too much whipped topping for my taste but still good. Lastly, I had a bite of the chocolate hazelnut silk pie, and oh my is it rich and satisfying!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner a couple times and brunch/coffee a handful of times and I'm always very satisfied with my experience!   The food is just delicious, the customer service is always on point and I love the vibe and people that this place attracts.   Take note that valet parking is likely what you will have to do if you come during busy lunch rush or weekend dinner hours because self parking is limited but it's not the end of the world.   Another Arcadia favorite!"}
{"text":"On Saturday I want to punch people in the face when here.  Mediocre food, overhyped, overpriced, no parking, bad service, and waaaaaaaaay too many people to enjoy yourself. Once upon a time you may have been worth it but with so many solid offerings in Phoenix these days your entitled attitude is not warranted.  No it's cool, I'll clear off the table that you just walked by four times with nothing in your hands.  What's that?  Oh I shouldn't do that?  I should just stand here and look at the table full of dishes until you walk by a 6th time?  Ok.  Hey, one more thing. Kiss my ass."}
{"text":"It's location is in the heart of Arcadia, in a very beautifully decorated facility. It can be very busy at times, which is a great sign of a great company, but parking can be difficult.  Besides that, this is one of my favorite breakfast and lunch places. They make great coffee, amazing sandwiches, and the staff is very friendly.   This is a great place to take an afternoon casual date, or a place to meet friends for breakfast or lunch on the weekend. LGO (as the regulars call it), stands out for their customer service and great food."}
{"text":"Love coming here! The pizza is great, all the ingredients taste fresh and delicious. The wine pairings are awesome and the service is wonderful. I really don't have a single bad thing to say about it. Go try it out, I'm sure once you do it will become a part of your regular date night rotation."}
{"text":"Brace yourself for artisan deliciousness.  I went here with my best friend for a girl's dinner night, and was totally overblown with how ornate and beautiful the inside of LGO is, how delicious the food is, and how adorable the connected grocery is.  We went on a Wednesday evening and didn't even have to wait. The menu, though not very large, caters very well to every niché. My friend is gluten intolerant, and they offer a variety of gluten free salads and a gluten free pizza crust (which was completely delicious.)  Together, we split a salad and a pizza, and each had a slice or two leftover. The total came to about $12 each, which is perfect for two broke college girls who need a night out to dress up, go out, eat food and discuss life.  Bonus: After browsing all the chic items the market attached to LGO offers, try the gelato. It is so authentic, it brings back memories of my trip to Europe."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Everyone I've tried has not disappointed but the Marguerite is my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday (Sunday at 1pm) for a friends birthday. I wasn't aware that the pizzeria doesn't open until 4PM so you have to kind of get up and do everything yourself -- go to the grocery to order your food and to the bar separately to get a drink. So, pretty casual during the day. I started with a white sangria and it was delicious, not very strong but fruity and refreshing. Had 3 orange slices in it & an apple slice & grape halve. Then because I wasn't too hungry I got the side cucumber salad & it was good -- cucumbers, avocado, tomatoes, olives, goat cheese I think?, and a side dressing & for only $3.50! Everyone else that I was with got the pizza & it looked amazing, next time I'm coming on an empty stomach to try it. I did have a quarter of the kids pizza & even that was good. Next time I come, it will be after 4PM so I can experience more of the restaurant part of it. Oh and its Arcadia so parking sucks, you pretty have to valet."}
{"text":"I wish I could just uproot you and make you an addition to my apartment.   LGO is fabulous in every way. Concert posters on the wall (but how did we get from the Rolling Stones to TSwift, guys?!), good music and a very relaxed feel.    Our waitress Brittany was So great. She got me excited over absolutely every bit of the menu, my date was lucky I didn't order one of everything. We got a bottle of wine, the gluten free chips and dip (with pimento, guacamole and salsa) and since my dinner partner is now gluten and dairy free, he refused to split a pizza. I was told the sourdough crust is a must, so I got the margherita pizza with artichokes added while he got the Rocket Man with their gluten free crust and goat cheese (because that's still allowed!)           At the end, I couldn't find any more room to eat--I didn't even make it through three pieces of my amazing pizza, but when she started her passionate schpeel on dessert-- I couldn't say no. So he tried the strawberry sorbet and I got the salted caramel gelato. She even brought us a scoop of raspberry sorbet to try on the house.   I'm obsessed. Please just make me all of my meals."}
{"text":"Great pizza, awesome salads and apps, but while service is friendly, it is also haggard so be prepared to flag someone down if you need a refill or your check."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fresh grated parm on pizza was wonderful. good service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"NOT SERVICE ANIMAL FRIENDLY :(   My friends and I were enjoying our meal when the executive chef came out to the dining area and asked if our animal was a service animal. Which was fine. He did not ask what service or task the animal is trained to do-which is what he is only allowed to ask. He instead just asked what the dog is for and stated that if he really was a service animal then he wouldn't be riding in a stroller and that we needed to leave. I'm sorry it's over 100 degrees outside and it's unacceptable for a dog to walk on hot pavement?  We're regulars here and have never had an issue before, and unfortunately I do not think we will be back.  Anyways, the red velvet gelato was good. Not something I'd probably go back to get again though."}
{"text":"I could have sworn a wrote a review for La Grande Orange considering how long I've been going here but I guess not. So now it's time to throw in my five stars for one of my favorite places in P-town.  La Grande Orange is know for their pizza and for good reason - it's delicious. The boyfriend and I went there for dinner on Monday night, which is a great night to go if you don't want to wait. We ordered our usual - a caesar salad and the gladiator pizza - sausage and pepperoni.  Our waitress was nice enough to split the salad on two plates for us. We both love this salad. It has a rich and tangy dressing, huge croutons and lots of shaved slices of fresh parmesan cheese. The cheese really makes this salad IMO. And the portion is perfect for two people. Kinda like the pizza. It's just the right size to share. If you have 3 or 4 people in your group definitely get more than one. The crust is thin and crispy, they use just the right amount of sauce and it's not overly greasy.   The atmosphere is cool but comfy and the service is always great. Parking can be a challenge but they do offer valet if you can't find a spot. And of course be sure to stop by the grocery afterwards - good stuff!"}
{"text":"As someone with many food allergies, including gluten, finding a delicious pizza is a challenge. No one in Phoenix does a gluten free pizza better than LGO. Their staff is always welcoming and kind, the service is quick, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. I love exploring the grocery next door as well. They have great gifts, treats, and local goods. Anytime an out of town guest visits me, I always take them to La Grande Orange!"}
{"text":"I never regret eating here and go monthly despite it being a bit of a drive from home.  It's by far my favorite pizza, almost always great service and the prices on the bottles of wine are great.  Who could ask for more?  Add ricotta to your pizza and thank me later!"}
{"text":"So I've been to LGO numerous times over the past couple years, ever since my girlfriend took me there for a hungover breakfast.  I've always enjoyed their variety of menu options, and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy breakfast/lunch option.  The food is reasonably priced, with the exception of their beautiful and creative Tammie Coe cakes with are crazy expensive.  The market aspect of LGO gives you something to do while you wait for your food to arrive at the counter.  My favorites are any of their lunch sandwiches.  And my friend loves their egg sandwiches so much he texts me to remind me how good they are.  This LGO is too adorable for words, and is hands down the better than their Pasadena location."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before a hike.  The ordering process is chaotic and finding a table is a serious challenge.  However, they took breakfast to a new level...love that extra thick and crispy bacon and creamy eggs...yum."}
{"text":"mmm The Commuter sandwich + bacon = my favourite!!!  I miss this place!  We were there once a week when I lived close by.  A La Grande adventure is in my near future....  :-D"}
{"text":"This is seriously hands down the best pizza i have tasted in this country. Im not even from phoenix, but shortly stayed there years ago and i still remember this pizza like it was yesterday. I also saw a really odd bird with a crazy beak. he was a funny lil thing.   ok so the pizza, i think the cheese made it spectacular. It also had corn and goat cheese, yeah im pretty much in love with it. It aint your moms pizza. It was just sooo good, melted in your mouth, new flavors, new ideas, great lil spot with outdoor seating, boos and good food. It def made a huge impression and i will prob always think of it as the best place i ever had pizza in the USA. two enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Curbside pickup, delicious salads (the Smoked Salmon salad is my new thing), great pizza + wings. I go here multiple times a week and it's rarely disappointing!"}
{"text":"I am still loving my favorite place, but quite a few times during my breakfast they have been giving me undercooked hardboiled eggs. I habe a hard time eattong eggs as it is and I am not happy when I get them and they are undercooked, extremely.  I just Think at that price for 2 eggs they shouldn't be undercooked."}
{"text":"Omg, get in here. It'll change your life :) brunch w champagne, yes please.    When you set foot in this place on a busy weekend morning you get sucked into the spirit.  It's bustling and everyone is happy, and everyone is drooling over the food and baked goods coming out of the kitchen.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get in here, I'll definitely be a regular from now on.  I ordered the Venice Beach burrito and it was sooooo tasty, we also decided to crack a bottle of champagne to celebrate the momentous occasion of experiencing this place.  The main room where you order at the counter has a staggering array of candy, gifts, baked goods, prepared meals, magazines, etc. etc. etc.  It'll take you a day just to look at it all.  Maybe next time I go back I can get my christmas shopping done while waiting in line.  The only things I would change about this place would be: I'd add table service and increase portions.  I'd also make the dining room feel a little more like the room where you order...it's just a little more inviting and comfortable.  Other than that, it was yummy and fun to eat here.  Great for a special occasion or a good place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here a few months ago to celebrate my 21st birthday, and the dining area was classy yet still relaxed, so it was perfect for a cozy night out. I ordered one of the drinks (light weight!), it was the grapefruit one, and it was absolutely delicious, perfect amount of citrus. The food was delicious, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out while visiting and was pleased!! I got a double pepperoni and half black olives and green peppers. You pull up and they bring your order out to you. The pizza was delicious!!!! Thin crust flaky and so buttery!! I devoured almost the entire pizza!!!  There was one slice left when i was finished! It wasn't even warm by the time I got back to my room and and I still ate the entire pizza!! The cheese is a really nice blend! I also got chicken wings. They're grilled and were a tad burnt but were still edible and good. I almost came back for dinner tonight with my staff but I was out voted."}
{"text":"Love: the pizza and the atmosphere.  I have tried four of the pizzas. My favorite by far is the avocado pizza. May sound odd, but it's good. I also like the Veg-o-rama. The Rocket Man claims to be \"SPICY\" but was not spicy at all when I ordered it. Mushroom Party is superb as well, the fennel really makes this one memorable.The crust is really good. The pizzas are on the small side, you could probably scarf one all by yourself, but I recommend going with a group and ordering a variety so you can try all the funky combinations.   Service is good, parking is hell on earth for dinner and all day on the weekends.  But like another reviewer said, if you know this going in, you'll be okay."}
{"text":"excellent food. great atmosphere and great people. the pizza is the best in town.  gluten free pizza is great as well"}
{"text":"Updated Review - After my review I was contacted by the hospitality group at LGO. The heard what I had to say and acknowledged the important of reviews and making sure their customers are happy. I am taking them from 2 stars to 5 for multiple reasons.  1.They contacted me within 45 mins. 2.They treated my review as important as it was their first.  3.They described what course of action was going to be taken. 4.They asked if I would please come back in and not let 1 bad experience ruin a long relationship.  They did everything they could do to correct a an issue and shouldn't be penalized.   Thank you LGO for taking care of business.   First Review (Below)  I have been here multiple times before but this time really bothered me. The music was loud which wasn't a huge deal but the fact that the pizza guy kept throwing the empty pizza trays on to the floor in an extremely loud, startling manner made dinner unbearable.  Every minute you would hear a crashing of empty tray on empty tray.  Very disappointed.  I used to eat here almost daily. I will come back again and hope it's a one off but it was by far one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Good food. A ton of highly priced crap to look at while waiting! Place is pretty casual, better wear your best pair of Lulus when coming to LGO."}
{"text":"I eat here always when in PHX. This location is better than the airport. For breakfast you should have the Commuter with Bacon. It's fantastic every time. Also, for lunch get the in house roast Ruben, non better anywhere. This is the best. Also, cookies are amazing!  Let me add that the Airpot location is very very good, just a limited menu. So, at the Airpot, it's the best!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the reasons why I didn't give it 4 stars.  Parking is quite limited.  You can't park on the side streets so valet is often an alternative.  Also, with the place being pretty busy, there can be a little bit of a wait for a table and you might be pretty near the adjoining table.  The pizza itself is really good.  You get to see them make it in the open kitchen so all the ingredients are fresh.  It can get hectic in the kitchen but it's cooked properly and with the right balance of meats, veggies, and sauce.  We had a margherita and it was very good due to its simplicity.  The rocket man added a few more distinct vegetables so that every bit didn't end up tasting the same when you put too many ingredients together.  Service was good and able to get drinks from next door as well.  Overall, another great pizza place in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice during my one month stay in Phoenix and it has been excellent every time. I have had three of the pizzas which have all been amazing. My personal favorite is the LGO wings ( I am a huge wings fan and these are some of my favorites). Would also recommend getting some desert from the LGO desert place next door"}
{"text":"After a few pickup orders from here, this has become my go to spot for pizza in Phoenix area.  The establishment is part of a larger group of restaurants based out of Santa Monica, spearheaded by Bob Lynn, who is well known as the gentlemen who made Houston's chain the success that they are. The establishment is clearly ran like a business and that's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly given that the value for the buck that one gets here is quite impressive. A solid size pizza to feed two people for under $15 with some premium ingredients like avocados, basil, etc? That's quite impressive and Bob deserves a pat on the back just for pulling that off.  The style of pizza itself in my view is very California. The crust is much thicker and sturdier than that of a Neapolitan pizza, yet the ingredients and flavors are much lighter than most American style pizzas. Many many healthy options. I also liked the crunch on the edges, with some cheese baked in. Having tried numerous pizzas here, from Avocado, to mushroom and onion and even the meat pizza, I enjoyed all of them. They really are very good pizzas, loaded with toppings very generously.   The shop itself is cool, yet overpriced to a degree I can't even describe. I mean, really really overpriced. Some of the small juice bottles here sell for $10 that would sell for half of that at grocery stores. The honey comb is a whopping $24. Mexican chocolates for $5 a pop for a small piece. Hot sauces somewhere around $10. It's a cool concept and just as any business, it has to profitable, so the shop is clearly making some serious margins. I'd suggest sticking to the pizza here."}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ my entire life and one of my favorite things to do is try out new pizza places. My friend always talked about this place, but we would always vie for Oreganos, Sauce, Grimaldi's, Nello's or somewhere else! I'm giving it three stars for a few reasons.  We just ordered a pepperoni pizza. Pretty simple. I didn't like how you got a Solo cup with ice, and you got to pick a can of soda. Personally, I don't drink coke out of a can and I only like it by fountain, so I thought the whole grab a can and pour it in a cup thing was weird. Plus, no refills, which is lame considering the cup is a kids size small. The pizza was good, but way too expensive for just one pizza. Also, the parking lot is way, way too small for a popular place like this. What I did like was the atmosphere, the pizza was fine, and setup is nice. I like the TVs as well."}
{"text":"LGO contacted me shortly after writing my last review. They offered a sincere apology and gave me a certificate as compensation for my poor service during my last visit. They also informed me that LGO coupons should always be accepted even if they are expired."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Whether you're stopping by the grocery side for a to-go sandwich and dessert or sitting in the bar and having some of their great beers on draft you'll enjoy your time here.    The pizza is incredible.  Most great pizza comes from a brick oven but not here.  They cook in pretty standard equipment but their ingredients and quailty are outstanding.  The people are always nice and the prices are reasonable.  I'd recommend valeting the car (behind the restaurant) as parking is at a premium."}
{"text":"I love LGO Pizza but always hated the parking situation. Luckily, they now have a valet service and if you get your valet card stamped, it's free. This makes it all the more enticing. My favorite pizza is the Mushroom Party - crimini, button, and oyster mushrooms. I'd like to try the Mother Earth because that sounds delicious (tons of vegetables) but that'll have to be next time. Their crust is both crispy and soft - a good combination. I haven't had any appetizers but they definitely have a large variety of items to choose from. If you are in the mood for pizza and want to try something different, this is going to be your new spot. Don't forget to valet!"}
{"text":"Take out, mid-day Saturday, busy as usual.  Tips:  Ordering in person is probably better than ordering over the phone if you have special requests.  And don't assume the person taking your order knows what \"vegan\" is even if that is an option for a food item - specify what needs to be removed (and they will happily accommodate) - then double-check the order.  Also, pretty sure I got regular milk in my soy latte - they confirmed it was soy, but it didn't look or taste like soy and I was unconvinced so I dumped it after we left (and after I did a taste test with a new soy latte from somewhere else).  The salads and pizzas are great and the staff is super friendly.  Docking a star for the milk mystery, but I will try their lattes again."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is incredibly popular amongst the locals - and deservedly so. I rank their food right up there with some of the best in The Valley!  Unlike most places these days that use the ever-so-popular brick/wood-fired approach, LGO opts to bake their pies in the more traditional pizza oven. Their ingredients are high quality and their sourdough crust is a lovely touch.  Oddly enough, my favorite creation isn't even on the menu anymore, but can still be ordered on request. The roasted corn and traditional margherita are also some of my favorites. They seem to cater more towards the vegetarian/garden pizza style here, which can be somewhat subjective based on your personal tastes.  It's not all about pizza at LGO. Although I would never expect it, their cheeseburger is quite possibly the best that I've found in my search, exceeding even the LGO Ingo offerings that can be found next door. Request to have it served on one of their English muffins and you won't regret it. Lots of ingredients, including some shredded cheese, which works much better than you would assume. Their chips and dip also ended up being a big surprise and has now become an essential \"starter\" every time we visit. The pimento and guacamole are top notch stuff.  Desserts are kind of hit and miss. I'm not a big fan of their red velvet or the old timer, which seems much too hard-textured to match the classic Hostess cupcake it's obviously attempting to improve upon. It's their sea salt cookie, topped with a scoop of gelato that has become the default request whenever we visit. Note that their bakery also serves a variety of other items as well, including various knick-knacks that seem to mostly be gift-related items.  Service can be iffy. We always seem to get stuck with one of those tiny tables up front, which is rarely able to accommodate the amount of food that we order. Servers vary. We've had some that are decent, while others rarely check up on us to see if we need anything else.  Also, don't go in here expecting to split your meal up into courses. We always order a cheeseburger and pizza, requesting the cheeseburger first. They always get all weird about doing the burger first and the pizza second. It inevitably comes out at the same time, regardless of what you request. A server claims this is because the kitchen has rules about how they do things - so if you're splitting your meal up, I suggest just ordering one item and then magically \"deciding\" to order something else after you're finished. Contrary to what my mother taught me, lying sometimes has its advantages.  The place can get loud at times, although it seems they've improved upon this issue as of late. Overall, it's a great dining experience. A nice atmosphere with a mixture of customers that isn't overkill on the hipster vibe.  After numerous repeat visits and hit or miss service, I can't quite give it a full five stars, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La Grande Orange or as we local's call it . . . LGO is a great neighborhood meeting place with a wonderful atmosphere and fantastic food.  I've been frequenting LGO since day-1 some ten years ago and always enjoy myself.  BREAKFAST SUGGESTION:  The perfect amount of nutrition and food for breakfast as I see it is 1/2 order of Granloa, Friut and Yogurt . . . granola roasted fresh each and every day.  PIZZA SUGGESTION: Try the gluten-free roasted pizza-crust 1/2 corn & goat cheese and add avocado and the other 1/2 classic margherita pizza and you'll not be disappointed.  If you're in the mood for a glass of wine, the Moobuzz Pinot Noir slightly chilled is a great complement.  PARKING: The Desert Parking valet guys are always gentlemen and will treat you special each and every time.  They will recognize you by name and if I ran as fast as they do to bring the car around, I'd loose a chin or two :-)  Keep up the good work LGO . . .   MURF"}
{"text":"Came back and tried this place out again for happy hour. We had a really great experience! I got sausage pizza and it was really fresh with thin crust and a nice amount of cheese. I saw the sausage was housemade so I had to get it. It was slightly spicy and really good! Our waitress Kelly was so friendly and attentive. Got the Kombucha mule again and loved it. You should make more konbucha cocktails! Got nice thick brownies from the bakery to go for dessert. Last time our experience wasn't great but the owner contacted me and really cared. Thank you for the wonderful customer service, we will be back again."}
{"text":"Was in phoenix on business and dug ujp this little spot with a bit of research. Well worth the drive from where I was staying. Service was warm and friendly - but not intrusive..atmosphere was lively, perhaps even a bit loud..but I wasn't there for a romantic dinner - just for great food. I did a half and half on the pizza with the waiters suggestion....the avocado pizza with prosciutto was to die for! Nice glass of white sangria and a an oh so yummy piece of red velvet cake for desert. I could not help but wander around and have a scoop of gelato next door and then browse through the grocery/bakery in this complex while I was there. A wonderful spot for a casual evening out. The only drawback is the parking, but they do have a $3 valet that will handle that discomfort for you."}
{"text":"wow, this place is packed and nowhere to park. the front parking says something about 20-30 mins only and you can valet in the back.  We ordered a couple pizzas and didnt take too long and also ordered some sweets to go.. Red velvet cake wasnt my favorite but it was still very good and i would get it again. We ordered The Rocket Man pizza and my daughter got a gluten free pizza. Rocket man was great, broccoli was kinda strange but ok, would definlty order it again, so many flavors"}
{"text":"The perfect pizza joint in Arcadia. I can't say enough good things about this place! Everything from quality of the food, happy hour Mon-Sunday (3-6), and just good people that work there. This is the perfect place to bring your friends, family, and even dogs are allowed outside. Prices are decent and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has such great potential. The drink menu is pretty decent and they have some creative pizzas. I always end up getting the mushroom party, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds. The dessert is to die for too. Give me a red velvet cupcake and I will swoon.  Three things keep me from coming back here more often: 1) It's rather small and cramped 2) The service has been slow every time I've been there 3) Parking is practically nonexistent"}
{"text":"What a neat little place.  We went around lunch time, but they serve the breakfast until 5 - I was a little bummed they did not serve their famous pizza until starting at 4 .... oh well, a reason to come back!  I had what was called the commuter sandwich - whatever kind of meat you want, eggs, tomatoes on their home made english muffin ... WOW is all I can say - soft and melt in your mouth.  Not what you would think from a English Muffin...  I also had a blueberry muffin - it was, without a doubt, the best I have ever had.  I wish this place was a little closer because I would be here all the time.  It was neat too, because I also saw Ryan Sandburg (chicago cubbies legend) eating here.  I didn't get my stalk on and ask for an autograph, but it still was cool to see him there.  I grew up watching him LOL.   Anyway - can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"**La Grande Orange Pizzeria is attached to La Grande Orange Grocery**  As a first timer, the way in which to do things here was slightly confusing but here's the gist: 1) Place and pay your food order at the LGO Grocery. Their menu offers pizza,       salads, burgers, and drinks. Gelato and pastries are also available for dessert.          In addition to made-to-order food, there are pre-packaged salads and        sandwiches available for purchase at the LGO Grocery.  2) If eating there, find your own table outside or in the adjoining LGO Pizzeria      which has the pizza oven visible to anyone seated in the room so you can watch      the cooks make your pizza if you so desire.  3) Once you find a table wait for one of the cooks to yel and I mean literally yell out            your name.  4) Pick up your pizza, return to the table, and enjoy!   So after a full morning of visiting the Desert Botanical Garden, lunching at Chelsea's Kitchen, and shopping at Biltmore Fashion Plaza me and my friend worked up a small appetite and agreed to share a pizza at LGO Pizzeria.   We shared the mushroom pizza which may sound like a regular pizza you can get at any Pizza Hut or Dominos.  HOWEVER the \"Mushroom Party\" pizza at LGO is anything but a regular mushroom pizza. Just the playful name alone: \"Mushroom Party\" suggests that you'll have a great time eating it. If you're not a fan of mushrooms don't get this pizza; but f you're like me and absou-freaking-lutely love mushrooms get this pizza!  The \"Mushroom Party\" includes a combination of crimini, oyster, and button mushrooms with onion and fennel.   The different types of mushrooms used, added to the taste and texture of the pizza. The onion and fennel gave the pizza a bit of tartness and sweetness and a bit of crunch. The sourdough crust also added another layer of flavor to the pizza.  The combination of all these factors definitely elevated the pizza from just being another basic mushroom pizza. We easily finished the pizza and each had 4 small, but filling, slices. At $15 it was a fair price for a quality, made-to-order pizza."}
{"text":"I've been going to LGO Marketplace for years, and for some reason never thought to go and dine in the Pizzeria Bar, until now.  I have to admit....I'm sorry I've waited to long!  The pizzeria bar is awesome!  It's a small space, but it's very cozy and inviting.   We went during happy hour (3pm-6pm, even on weekends!!) and was happily greeted with $5 specialty cocktails with beer and wine specials.  We went for the specialty drinks (Negroni for me, and a Your Money or Your Life for him) and were incredibly pleased with how refreshing and delicious they were!  We also split the Shrimp Ceviche, and the Green Chile Burger.  I would 100% order either of these items again; the shrimp was fresh and had nice acidity, and the burger was lick-your-fingers good.  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients in their food :)  Next time you are craving some LGO, consider popping into the bar area and enjoying your meal among the people!!  It's definitely worth checking out and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is in my top-3 of the best pizza I've ever had...I don't know what they do with the dough, but it's outstanding!  I should preface that I like really thin crust and more of a fufu/gourmet type of pizza, which is what La Grande Orange serves up--Not a pepperoni and sausage kind a guy.  My only complaint is that I wish they had a larger selection of pizzas to choose from (the roasted corn is one of my favs).  I also don't like the limited menu in the evening...that was a real bummer recently.  While you're there, you have to try a Tammie Coe cookie...oh, they are really good!"}
{"text":"Had been waiting to try this place-heard nothing but greatness.  Went for a quick lunch before a work event and it was PACKED on a Thursday.  I got an already-ready salad because I was in a hurry and it was FAB.  My co-workers both got sandwiches and said they didn't disappoint.  I love the atmosphere and can't wait to go back for brunch and when I have more time to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I will start with that. However, everything else is...odd. From everyone and their mother being able to manhandle your food at the counter, to the lack of space to just stand without being in someone's way, to the absolute suckfest that is parking, LGO is okay. Nothing more."}
{"text":"Holler out to the Eisenbergs who insisted that I try this place.  The baked chicken wings are splendid as are the chips with three dips.  It 's hard to not be shaken by the shaken lemonade. Equally hard is to know that Sangria was ever made with anything other than white wine but this one is fantasticaly representing the fact that the place is built in the middle of an orange grove.  Try the avocado pizza with the prosciutto, the Rocket Man, the Fallen Agnel, and the Gladiator! You'll not go wrong."}
{"text":"How in the heck did I not know about this place, especially being as how I am always at Postinos?  Helloooo.... This place is a combination of delicious food and quirky fun gifts.  I could spend hours in here buying fun trinkets. What a great place for unique gifts. In addition, they have amazing baked good, gelato, pizza, sandwiches.  Oh my!!!"}
{"text":"Love to come here early in the morning on the weekend (before 8am). We bring our 17 month in and the loud music covers his early morning noises. The food is fresh and bright and delicioso, the atmosphere is pretty good, the clientele are upscale and eclectic. This is a good spot, except that we are starting to get  bit bored by the food. It's great, but we could use a little menu change once in a while. The aforementioned music is usually too loud -and I'm a guy who inhaled and listened to Van Halen I at at full volume for about three years-- but we still love it and the fact that we can get in there without crowds is really a plus."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Phoenix. My wife and I are known pizza snobs. We don't love the stigma that goes with the title, but we've come to embrace it over our four years of marriage. LGO's sourdough crust and fresh mozzarella has gotten nothing but race reviews from both of us.  If you can get past the crazy long lines and sometimes blaring loud music at night, this place is the perfect pizza joint. Here's a suggestion: Come during the lunch hour if you really want to enjoy a pizza. Lines are down and the music is at a bearable level."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've probably been to this restaurant more than any other place in Phoenix.  Every time its truly a great experience.  Roasted Corn Pizza absolutely rules!  Make sure you go next door, pick out a bottle of wine (very reasonable prices and no corkage fee next door) and buy some English Muffins for later.  When you're done wash it down with some truly awesome gelato."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and love the food. Love the kale salad. Food did come out wrong but Nicole went way over the top to fix it. I love that about this place. People like Nicole make it a pleasure to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is like little pieces of California eateries all combined into a very fun atmosphere.  Great store with everything from jewelry, water bottles and Tshirts to foodie finds.  The service & food were both outstanding.  LOVED the avocado pizza with fresh basil & lemon zest!!!"}
{"text":"Best sourdough pizza in Phoenix. Unreasonably delicious. Their gluten free crust also rocks... And is homemade and not the typical rice based crust every other pizza place in Phoenix uses. Just go here. You will be thrilled."}
{"text":"We go to new pizza places all the time. Obsessed. La Grande Orange's pizza is the VERY top favorite right now!! I want to go back for my birthday which is a big deal. I want more just writing about it! Oh and we got the Gladiator pizza with all of the free extra upgrades. Also highly recommend the salted caramel gelato!! Soooo good- Can't praise enough!"}
{"text":"When I'm in Phoenix, I make this a priority stop.  LGO is the best, and glad to see they are growing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Their pizza rocks and they also have a lot of my other favorite things: burgers ON english muffins, wings, shrimp ceviche, gelato, fresh lemonade, and GREY GOOSE!  Their \"shakin' lemonade\" combines lemonade, Grey Goose, and a sprig of rosemary, really amazing.  If you want to enjoy some nice wine, you can select a bottle from the grocery store connected to the restaurant and enjoy it with your meal.  Instead of crayons and paper, they have wikki sticks for the kids.  Although parking is limited, they offer comp valet, and the valet guys are always fast and nice.  The beau and usually catch a seat at their community table. If you're with a group, expect to wait a bit."}
{"text":"As far a pizza goes I have to say that LGO's pizza is just okay. I love, love, and I mean love pizza. I would eat it every day. Cold for breakfast even.   But the pies I have had here definitely left something to be desired. I love the toppings and the interesting flavours but I am sill waiting for that wow factor that makes me want to have this pizza again and again. (** I do love that they will halve the specialty pizzas for you with no qualm. You can try two pies in one visit.)  There are a few pies on my \"need to try that\" list. So I will be back. Plus I really want to try the burgers and the wings. I'd say at the least two more trips in the near future, of my own will. Maybe more if someone else chooses to invite.   I love the chandelier in the dining area and the TV over the long bar. This place has a nice rustic feel in with the concrete bar top and the rich dark wood tables. A few larger tables for a bigger party but most of the tables seat four. Or two if you're by the window.   If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your pizza on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one.   All in all... It is something I say you should try once. Especially if you love toying new places and love you some pizzas."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing brunch. Great vibes. Megan M took my order and was helpful and fun. Can't wait to try this place for dinner. The portions were huge and the service was quick. Only thing is, the parking is limited. So biking or walking would be ideal. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Had the croque madame for breakfast and it was fantastic. Delicious albeit a little pricey for what came on the plate (one egg? boo.) My only qualm was that it was busy even on a Monday morning and the employees don't seem terribly happy to be working. No smiles anywhere! Not when you ordered, not when you picked up your food, or your coffee. It felt like a tense environment up until I sat down to eat in the other room.  I love all the books, candles, and random stuff they have for sale, in addition to the delicious baked goods from Tammie Coe next-door.   Free valet, too!"}
{"text":"Located in a residential area of town, this place offers some very fine tasting pizzas. Their salads are excellent too. Place was very packed on the weekend night we went there. Probably it was no surprise because this establishment's food is simply great. The place definitely has a nice eclectic ambiance. And the service is attentive and friendly. Plus, they offer some very good gelato and other take out foods in their store/deli right next door."}
{"text":"I have been a great fan of the LGO since the very beginning-living just down the street. In fact, The whole LGO Phenomenon has made living in our hood a whole lot more interesting. I would say we are pretty much regulars both at the grocery and pizzeria.  I think I have probably tried everything on the pizzeria menu at one time or another with my favorites being the chicken wings, the orange fennel and spinach salad and of course the pizza. (Still prefer the fish sandwich the old way...) In the past year (or so) we had noticed a slight decline in the usually great vibe in the pizzeria. The food was lacking a bit of soul and the place just seemed to be getting tired. We went back last week and I noticed a difference right away. The place was mobbed-no big surprise-it was Saturday night-so we put our name in and proceeded to stand in our usual corner to wait it out. No more then 10 minutes went by and the manager apologized for the wait and offered us Sangria. Okay! What's not to like about that? 5 minutes later a server was offering us a slice of cheese pizza. Now, was that necessary? No. We would have waited patiently and people watched.  But was it classy, friendly, and neighborly? Yes! Do they need to do that every time-No. We consider this our neighborhood place and to feel welcomed like that was so nice. The service is usually great at LGO-casual but efficient-the way we like it. Personally, at a place like LGO, I don't care what servers are wearing-I really don't even notice-What I do care about is genuine hospitality. Cara, our server, brings that in spades. The food has its soul back and I love the new gelato look and the expanded dessert menu. I am so thankful LGO has stepped it up, (I suspect with a new manager) and a little reinvention. Maybe we'll see a new salad popping up in the near future?"}
{"text":"8/11/11  Arrived early to meet a friend for happy hour.  While I waited, I ordered a Dark 'n Stormy, which was made with Gosling's rum and ginger beer and was very satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A#3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A  I recall having to nurse it, when what I really wanted to do was order another one.  We eventually ordered a pizza to share, the Fallen Angel, which consisted of local Schreiner's sausage, roasted yellow peppers, shaved fennel, and \"premium cheese and red sauce.\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA#mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA  Very, very good!  Great thin crust, although IMO the red sauce made for a soggy pizza.    Guess we also ordered chicken wings, although I don't remember the experience, so I most likely didn't have any.    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow#pwqkdvk8VnOBNmWaDH-uow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA#XvbD54Sj8m2i6qSa2MxCuA  I haven't returned, but that's because there's so many restaurants to try in this valley we live in!  I must go back before the end of the year..."}
{"text":"First time at this place . Had the Reuben sandwich. Normally I don't like cole slaw and forgot to ask for it without, but that was by far the best tasting Reuben sandwich I have had In a long time. The flavor of the slaw really pulled it together . Great atmosphere and good crowd if people . The service was excellent. I'll definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I LalalalaLOVE this place! Their pizza is so delicious!!  I've been here many times and alway order my personal fave-- the margherita pizza!  The dough is just so amazing I can't even describe it. So good that it almost comes close to the amazing pizza dough in NY. [the water totally makes a different in the dough]  I also got an order of the wings. They were not your average hot wings. They were baked and had a tangy BBQish sauce to 'em. [can't even describe the taste but were yummy]  Plus, the restaurant is such a cute and trendy place to have dinner! It's almost always busy though even during the week!   It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"When a friend and I were talking, one thing we both agreed on @ LGO; WINGS. Bleu cheese and ranch are both AMAZING. Pizza is incredible as well! Made a great date night the other day. Keep your shorts on for parking tho!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan -- and they have vegan options... Yay!!! they have a great farm fresh vegan pizza!! Soo yummy!! My friends enjoyed the salted chocolate chip cookies! And OMG the almond milk latte is the best I've ever had.  Annnndddd TheY have kombucha on tap!!! The service was on point!!"}
{"text":"Psst! Hey, I like you more than Pizzeria Bianco. Mainly because you have good pizza, and I don't have to spend half my life on a waiting list for it. Hip-hip-hooray for stress-free pizza!"}
{"text":"I guess it was bound to happen, people grow apart, love doesn't always last.  It's hard enough to park at your place, but I'd always finagle a way. Just to be near you. Then the neighbors started blocking the side road options, but I was willing to walk to be with you.  I had noticed your growing libido and sophistication, you got into wine. Sometimes you drank too much, but I wasn't concerned, you were witty, you were upscale, you won awards. So you got a bit arrogant and cocky, who wouldn't with all the sudden acclaim?   I thought with time you'd chill out and we'd be cool again.  When you started sharing your fantasies about some Italian chick from Milano, I was somewhat jealous, but you said there was plenty of you to go around. Maybe that would have been the case if you didn't move her into the same block where we hung together. Did you really have to crowd me out that way?  I should have seen the signs back then, but I didn't want to. I'd come by and you were always so busy. I don't want to cramp your style, but I missed your flavor baby. I didn't want to be too clingy, so I didn't come by as often.   Every now and then I'd think back to our first date. The flickering candle and the juicy large grilled wings. Your wings were so good and tempted again I'd head out. On the way I remembered a more recent visit when your wings, like your feelings had started to change. Sometimes burnt, sometimes cold. Your mind wasn't on us, baby. Your mood swings were getting out of control. I suspected that your attention was all on that lovely Milano Chick, but she's a fling and I'm the real deal, so I let you be.  Weeks would go by before I'd talk myself into spending some time with you. I started to be more creative when we made love, customizing the toppings despite the surcharges piling up. Taking our traditional 13 dollar item straight into the stratosphere. Oh you tasted great this way, but the price of these visits were starting to hurt.   I soothed my hurt feelings with the richness of Arlecchino next door. Yeah, if you can love an Italian, so could I baby. He was always willing to lend an ear, to let me cry on his shoulder when you were too busy to give a damn.   I told him about the time when I came over and sat on the couch for 20 minutes before you even realized you had company.  You had one of your hipster friends serve me some drinks, telling me you were in the back and would be right out, but you never came. I walked out in tears, but not before a quickie with Arlecchino.   And how another time you made me pay for your bad wings and I didn't catch it on the bill until later, that was underhanded and cold. Arlecchino just nodded and gave me two free samples. He's a considerate partner.  After I walked out that night, you hardly ever called me, but my cravings for the memories of the past would sometimes return. I think of the night we shared that roasted corn and goat cheese, that pitcher of Stella Artois and you introduced me to all your new hipster friends.   So when I came by on Sunday afternoon I was puzzled.  You didn't even greet me at the door with a smile. I let myself in. Where did all your hipster friends go, LGO? I was determined not to just sit on the couch being ignored again.  I'll be patient, I'm sure you'll be right over.  So hungry for you, I glimpsed a blond over in the kitchen. I had to know, did she know where you were? Oh, she said, looking at me like I was your mother not lover she said  \"Those hipster friends don't hang here, just get in line over there and help yourself.\"   So shocked, you're just a whore now to everyone.   I'm supposed to go over to the meat market, stand in line with the rest of your bitches, tell you what I want without even a welcoming kiss of attention and then get it myself when it's ready? Or I can call ahead and you'll leave some love note on a counter for me to pick up and take home to read alone?  This is how you roll? I'm not even worth a goodbye hug?  So I'm leaving my own little love note to you with my BFF Yelp.  \"Baby, when I come over to your place, I want to sit down, be with you one on one, maybe chat with some of your friends. Have them bring me the warm lemon towel when you get my fingers all sticky.  I don't want to wait in line like a Mcdonald's, for your attentions, then go serve it to myself. If I wanted to self pleasure I wouldn't be on a date. I finally get it. You're just not that into me anymore. You know what, the feeling is mutual. Consider your poser ass dumped.\""}
{"text":"Service a bit rushed, take some time to enjoy us as much as we enjoy you.  Can't add much more to the glowing food reviews, coffee is great too!"}
{"text":"We love LGO and have been going here for years. Excellent pizza, coffee, danishes... the list goes on and on."}
{"text":"Ok danger zone - I live right across the street and eat here way too often. How can you complain with awesome food and staff right there? Everything is good and fresh and I love it.  One complaint would be some inconsistency with the salads - don't get me wrong, they always taste great but the size varies quite often. The burgers are usually pretty good but the meat always seems under seasoned.   Minor complaints that won't keep me from eating that stuff again."}
{"text":"Fun place..with \"hipster\" (Arcadia farmhouse) vibe, lots of energy.  Employees are unfailingly nice and the few items I've had (salads, sandwiches) have been delicious. Large retail area (gift items, foods, etc.), immediately within the Entry, shares space with ordering counter & bakery cases, so it gets crowded with folks lined up, ordering or waiting for orders! Everybody seems friendly & patient, though:)  The only drawback is an extremely narrow, limited (like 10 spaces!) parking lot.  Still a fun spot.  Just get there early!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I want to like LGO, I really do. But I've been here enough now where the hipness of the place has worn off, and all that's left is decent food at outrageous prices and a crowd like a motherf-er.   I like to order the pizzas to go, and the consistency on the time they're ready is all over the map. They say 25 minutes, I show up in 25 minutes, and the pizza has obviously been sitting there and is cold. They say 30 minutes, I show up at 20, I am chastised for showing up \"early\", then I sit for another 30 waiting for the goddam pizza. This is late nite too and totally ridiculous.  We walked over there the other day for coffee and the crowd was a nightmare. At this point, I'm just sick of it. It is actually a negative that I live around the corner and can go whenever. It would be better if it were further away and therefore an \"event\" for us to check it out.   Anyway, it's a cool place sure. I like the \"co-op\" feel and they sell some really cool beers. But it's over priced and waaaaay too hectic. I'm just over it....."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for pizza and drinks. The gladiator is absolutely amazing! It is on a sour dough crust with pepperoni and sausage. They put crack in the cheese and the sauce has a great flavor. The bone-in wings were also very good and everything was reasonably priced. We ordered at the counter and ate in the dining room; a very sweet waitress took care of our drinks and expedited the food. Took a chocolate chip sea salt and snickerdoodle home for a treat, never disappoints."}
{"text":"What is life without pizza? The pizza crust is crispy and doughy,  cheese is real,  and the sauce is sweet and season. The quality is undeniable. The pistachio Gelato rivals the ones internationally.  It's a local hangout that worth going. They have Italian market that is attached which offers the full menu to go."}
{"text":"Take-out review only.  Ordered a personal size margherita pizza. It was pretty good. Thin, crispy crust and great flavor.  I loved the place itself! It was fun to look around at all the old games and candy and other little trinkets."}
{"text":"Their pizza is top notch. The store they have attached to the restaurant is pretty neat as well. I would have given them 5 stars, but the server was a B to my fiance.  They don't have bread or anything while you wait. Luckily the good pizza made it worth it. I would go back."}
{"text":"I can't even handle how much I love this place! It's hands down my favorite pizza joint around. We always get the avocado pizza and we add corn then sprinkle a little bit of the sea salt they have on the tables over the avocados. Oh my goodness. You just can't top that with their sour dough crust . I just can't even. Dang it, I want that now! They also have delish fries and chicken wings, but let's be real, the pizza is what it's all about."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place but the parking situation! Luckily the amazing menu options help you forget about prior fiasco! The pizzas, smoothies & sandwiches are all amazing! Love the cute little shop with best little novelties. The fallen angel or avocado pizzas are amazing! You can't go wrong with the salads either!"}
{"text":"First off the parking lot is small and they have the validated parking (cough cough money trap).   The place is a store/pizzeria. Its small and cramped so as to give the impression that is it crowded even if there are only a few people in there.  (this is an old trick many stores use)  Anyway I went in to place my order and I couldn't order a slice, I had to order a whole pizza. No problem, I was rushed to make an order.  I don't know why, its not like there was anyone behind me.  whatever.   I wanted to order an ice tea, but found that I had to order from a different line. what? huh ummm okay.  whatever.   I sat thinking \"hmm this better be some bomb ass pizza\" finally it comes out and it was disappointing.  It wasn't terrible, but it just wasn't good.  Honestly I can think of 3 other places that make better pizza with less rules, less money and less pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Ive heard rave reviews about this place for years and last night was my first experience at LGO. We ordered the baked chicken wings, and two pizzas; the gladiator and the avocado pizza. All three items were delicious, my favorite being the avocado pizza, it was very fresh and flavorful. We were stuffed after our meal but their desserts looks to die for too. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The best Pizza I have ever had. I had the avocado pizza with Prosciutto. The saltiness of the prosciutto paired with the creamy avocado, juicy tomatoes and fresh basil was to die for. The pizza crust was flavorful and cooked to crisp perfection.  Everyone has to try it once! I know I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, Phoenix has too many pizza places, but LGO- is one of the best!   They have the best types of pizza that you can't find anywhere else and they are perfect for sharing- they also have pimento cheese dip that is to die for! Love it.   They also have a great gift shop side that has lots of cute gifts and little things   Go here and enjoy with your friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely thought about 5 stars, am still thinking about 5 stars but am going to give it 4 for the moment. I think I need another La Grande pizza to give it a bold 5 stars. All food critics journey to a restaurant at least 2, 3, 4, 15 times before giving their final critique- the same goes for me, by the twentieth time or so I still haven't had everything I think I could, twice or so over.   Love the pizza, Love the french fries- possibly the last two foods I would have if it was my last day on Earth."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for quite some time and decided to check it out. The pizza was good, but not amazing. The way the restaurant was laid out was quite confusing and I kept having to ask the employees there how to order, where to get drinks, and where they would call my name. The confusion lies in the fact that they let the grocery image of the business run front. I think that is silly since I heard about that via there pizza that should be there flagship business IMO. Anyway, back to the food it was good, but not better then pizza bianco, but I agree it is a nice place to take a date if its casual.  Due to the location and the fact that the pizza is just ok, i probably wont go there too often."}
{"text":"Great place to take a date. A little loud. Good food, not too expensive. Has a very cool little store next door that you could find a small specialty gift at."}
{"text":"Great all around -- as a casual, high quality dinner spot and as a market with solid deserts.  Fresh grilled fish, pizzas and salads all memorable -- sit at the chef's table, a high-top butcher block table with a prime spot to see all the action in the kitchen.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Although I've been coming to LGO forever, I never really talked about it... It was there... everyone knew about it... but now... it seems like LGO is going global...   I'm thinking its going to be the next Starbucks... I'm sure plans are already in the works for LGO Bangalore!   They're opening a Postino down the street from me in Central Phoenix !! YEAH... I'm really tired of FEZ.. I can only hope that they change the C-Back/Central corner much they way they changed Arcadia!!   Well, went there last night with my buds and thought we have some of their FANTASTIC white sangria and their wings.. In my opinion... The food of the Gods! OK, yeah... I could have gone to wing-street... or KFC... But as god as my witness... the combo of Sangria and Wings ...mmmmmmmm...   First of all the wings are plump, juicy, large wings... grilled with a savory sauce unlike any I've ever had. Served with a home-made cheesy ranch dip... YUM.. coupled with a house salad.. Wooooo!   The Sangria is AWESOME! Fresh fruit, smooooooth finish.... I can never have just 4... yum...Watch out for Thursday night Cougar nite... they seem to be everywhere! If you dig that stuff... you will be in total heaven!"}
{"text":"Listen up-  LGO IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL. if you haven't read my other review, peep that. But listen up. They have pitchers of margaritas. Yes, you read that right. PITCHERS. Their pizza is the tastiest and they offer both gluten free and vegan options- perfect for my food allergy friend. But if you're like me and are a regular food warrior I say order 600 orders of everything on the menu, take it home and live off the food in your $20,000 SUBZERO fridge."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and I have never been disappointed. The crust texture is what pizza is meant to taste like. If you don't know now, then you'll learn when you get to LGO.  The LGP Chips and Dips plate is a great way to start your meal here. My favorite pizzas are the Roasted Corn, Avocado Pizza (add proscuitto), and the Gladiator. The guys in my group couldn't get enough of the Gladiator. It's a meaty guy-type pizza and guys will forget about that \"I-can't-get-a-good,-satisfying-meal-at-a-trendy-restaurant\" feeling. Overall, I love the unique pizza toppings at this restaurant and the quality ingredients they use. If you're looking to take a Phoenix visitor to a decent pizza meal in Phoenix then this is the place for you.   THe little grocery shop next door has all sorts of fun knickknacks to look at. The gelato shop also next door has tasty gelatos, that is, if you have enough room once you're done at LGO."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love their pizza and market right next door. We ordered rocket man, margarita, and gladiator. All pizzas are really good.  Very good place for a nice dinner with family or a date."}
{"text":"I love pizza, and I've tried pizza all over the valley (including the famed Pizzaria Bianco), but I am yet to find a place I like better than La Grande Orange.  The crust is flavorful and crispy and the toppings are exotic and delicious.  The roasted corn is my topping of choice.  Their specialty salads are phenomenally good as well.  With Gelato and a grocery next door, it makes for a complete evening.  Spend the evening eating pizza, then come back for breakfast the next morning."}
{"text":"Fantastic find on a hockey trip to Scottsdale.  Great crust--perfect balance of chew and crunch combined with nice flavor. Good and different selection of toppings.  Had the avocado pizza and toasted corn with goat cheese pizza.  Both were excellent. Gelato was a bonus--fresh mint and chocolate chunk."}
{"text":"LGO is awesome. I've probably eaten here at least once a month for the last 5 years. My favorite time to go is during breakfast, something about the insanely busy store/restaurant and incredibly confused people make me feel right at home.  I love the croque madame, it is an open faced sammy with ham, tomato, spicy mustard, and an egg topped with gruyere and broiled to perfection. The lemon ricotta hotcakes are also really good as are the chilaquiles. The coffee is some of the best in arcadia, and I always buy a bag of beans (Mr. Espresso) to take home. I also purchase a cold coffee press here and I use it almost every day.   Lunch and dinner usually lack the frenzy of people and can be a bit more relaxed. The pizza is great and the wait is never very long.   The food is fresh, the employees are nice and it is great for people watching. Sit outside and soak in the gorgeous weather we are sure to have for at least 2 more months!"}
{"text":"A friend took me there last night to get cookies and I have to say they have some amazing cookies. I can't wait to try other stuff there  the pizza looks yummy as heck.."}
{"text":"I really enjoying coming to LGO with my girlfriend about 1 hour before closing.  We found that when we go too early there is very little parking and there is always a wait.  So we opted to go later and have found this to be the best time.  The wait staff is very nice and helpful around this time too, since it close to closing the staff is more relaxed and fun.  With less people in the place it also makes for a more romantic setting.  I really enjoy getting half Lime Avocado and half roasted corn pizza.  I feel you get the best of both worlds with this half and half.  Nice cool and smooth texture when you bite into the Lime Avocado slice and then the roasted corn slice gives you a pop of flavor and.  I have found that the wine selection has a few good choices to complete the pizza or if you are a pizza and beer person the beer selection is average.  You will be able to find a beer that you like on the list.  If you feel like getting a little desert when you are done with your meal then you go can walk next door and get some delicious gelato; that is if you get done with your dinner before they close."}
{"text":"I was taken here by a wonderful person who wanted to have me experience the best chicken salad ever (which it was). This place is bomb. Their margarita pizza is also amazing. It's kind of pricey though.  I will go back"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Nice atmosphere, good food, and great service.  This is a fun place with a group or with your significant other.  The margarita pizza is the best in town in my opinion (yes, better than Pizzeria Bianco).  The wings are also great.  Not a great selection beer, but good enough I suppose.  Another neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Vegan post- Came here last night and my experience was much better than usual. The waitress was wonderful which has been out of the ordinary in the past. I got the rocket man with added corn and no cheese and it was to die. The prices aren't bad considering you can split a pizza or have leftovers the next day. The drinks are okay, a little light with the bottle I think. Didn't get the gelato this time, but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"We just visited Phoenix for a long weekend and this was on our short list of restaurants to hit up. We lived in Phoenix for almost seven years and have always loved LGO's food (Postino and Chelsea's Kitchen too!) This time did not disappoint. We were there on the 4th of July and a few of us enjoyed the 4 cent sangria. Our table shared pizzas which were perfect and everyone left happy.  We ate breakfast there the next day and everything from the drinks (coffee and freshly squeezed OJ) to the food (pancakes and eggs) were awesome. The staff is friendly, the ambiance lovely. A total win."}
{"text":"B for customer service and A+ for coffee, D for food. Had higher hopes for this place with all the 5 star reviews on yelp and the fact that there was a wait to get a table. It was our first time here and we had to valet our car because there was no room in the parking lot. We didn't mind because it was free, just had to tip of course.   Very cool gift shop and coffeeshop attached the main dining room with tons of eclectic gifts and food items not to mention fresh cheeses and wine. They even had a takeout counter with fresh sandwiches and pizza if you didnt have time to sit down and eat.   We sat down after a short wait and ordered some beers and water. There was a table that sat after us nearby that got their waters before we did, not a good start. Our beers arrived and still no water, we flagged down a random waiter and finally got some waters and our waitress came back a few minutes later to take our order.  Pizza arrived and looked good for the most part, but when we picked up a slice it was drenched in oil but we  decided to give it  a try regardless.Ughh, no seasoning, barely any tomato sauce and soggy crust.  It was just not edible for our taste. We complained and they were very polite about taking it back and taking it off the bill for us. They even sent the chef out and he explained to us that its very oily because they put oil in the dough and more oil on the sheet pan. He also explained that their style of pizza does not have much tomato sauce and they don't season their toppings. He said that their pizza is not for everyone but thats what makes it unique.   I can respect that and I appreciate them not charging us and coming out to see if there was anything they could do to make it better. We paid for our drinks and proceeded to go eat at my favorite pizza joint \"pomo pizzeria napoleatana\". Thats my kinda pizza.  Not hating on this place, I just prefer a seasoned, non greasy pizza from a brick oven with a crispy crust. Won't be coming back for their pizza, but their coffee with housemade nut milk I would get again and again, delicious!"}
{"text":"UHHh this is the best place EVER !! they read my dreams of what i'd like to have for lunch and then made it a reality. I got SO excited when i saw this grab n go of Wedge of Lettuce with Spicy Chickpeas cucumber and avocado with pineapple i knew instantly it was mine for the taking !! then i learned they could make you a fresh one - so i did that ! Also got a Matcha Smoothie like omg.    Lots of cool home gifts and books/candles little items to purchase.  I wish i had one in Michigan !!"}
{"text":"Great spot to take a first date. Plan on waiting but you can have fun while you do it. I loved that I got to take my date over and actually pick out a bottle of wine instead of just looking at a list. Pizza was awesome as well as the whole overall experience."}
{"text":"If there is a heaven, God greets you with a plate of pimento cheese dip from LGO accompanied by warm tortilla chips!  Once you are settled in, you find an A-Z cookie on your pillow when it is time for bed.  YUMMY, YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Not sure if i even have to write a good review, all these speak for themselves, but i will tell you my go to item.  Croque Madame ( sometimes substitue Turkey for ham ) and add avocado.. you will not be disappointed, if you are, find me and i will go with you there and order you something new."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom this morning for breakfast for the first time and we both really enjoyed ourselves.  We had never been here before, and both really enjoyed the experience here.  The place is small, with very limited parking, but I think they offer free valet from what I heard.  I'm kind of between 3 and 4 stars for this place, but decided to round up since it really is one of a kind and quite enjoyable.  When I go to places like this, I tend to hold the bar high, and expect a little bit more then the usual, so please bear with me while I do some  venting AND complimenting.  After going inside the place was really cute and well decorated.  Plenty of seating with lots of stuff to shop for!  I did find the ordering to be a bit confusing, and somewhat irritating.  You go to the register and place your order, and their supposed to call your name, but we sat there for a while and never heard anything.  I finally went to the counter and I guess our food had sat out there for a while and no one ever told us! No one called our name, nothing!  Plus, they just left the food on this table to get picked up, and anyone could have taken it without us realizing it.  Also, we were extremely thirsty and were looking for water and asked when we went to place our order.  They said that there's water glasses by a complimentary water station in the dining area.  The glasses were tiny, and there wasn't any ice!  ggggrrrr. It's hot here and we're THIRSTY.  Plus, that area is really tight, so we had to make like 3 trips to get water since we were dying.  Ok, now for the compliments.  The food was awesome! My mom and I really both loved our experience here, and the english muffins were delicious! My mom even bought a pack to take home with her, as she really enjoyed the food as much as i did.  I went with the eggs rancheros, and it was so tasty! I had never had it before and boy, did I clean my plate on this dish!  Fresh fruit came with it to, and the english muffin was tasty with what appeared to be home made jelly.  My mom went with some pancakes, I think and she loved them as well.  Overall, a tasty place and I would gladly return in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their ceviche isn't as good as it was 3 years back.  I am not really sure why as my talents rest in more in eating than cooking. They also have an amazing lemonade and Rosemary drink that i have drunken dreams about."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm reeeally allowed to review this because we didn't actually order anything. But, I'll give you the rundown. It was Valentines day, or AZ Statehood day. We arrived after discovering Pizzeria Bianco had a 4-5 hour wait. We called LGO ahead and asked if they were very busy and they said they weren't. Once we arrived we were seated immediately and decided what we wanted and waited. And waited... It was 20 minutes late, and a couple that had just been seated had a waiter immediately. That's when we knew they forgot us, I'm sure the pizza would have been good, but I think customer service is a huge deal so we got outta there! On they way home we decided to order Hungry Howie's instead. Oh well, we were ready to spend $40 on pizza but $20 tasted better anyway.  So, zero stars for being ignored!"}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way: La Grande Orange Pizzeria has delicious food. Their grilled wings are savory and their pizzas are incredible. They have a lot of vegan options as well.   LGO also has an adjourning gelato shop on one side and a small store on the other. The gelato is amazing, as are their selections of cakes to go with the gelato. The store has some amazing desserts for take-away as well as wines, colas, and a number of kitschy little items. People-watching there is also grade-A.   Now for the caveats. Parking is hellish, so watch out for peak restaurant hours. LGO is NOT a well-kept secret. Also, LGO is not for the enochlophobic; until seated, you will have to deal with a crowd. I have been there many times and have never seen it below nearly full capacity. The restaurant is not very big, so seating is crowded.    The service is very good considering how terribly busy it is. If you haven't been to LGO, you must go. Brave the parking, brave the crowds... you WILL be rewarded!  OR (considering how much I love to eat there) stay away at all costs! Do NOT go there!"}
{"text":"Shortly after my first review, I was contacted by the customer service manager apologizing for my mediocre experience and wanted to make it right. I really appreciated that because it shows a lot on their part; they actually care about their customers! She offered me a generous gift certificate, unlike oreganos who sent me a $10 gift card which ended up insulting me even more.  So I went to LGO today with my parents for my \"third times a charm\" experience. We got there and the hostess said the wait would be about 15-20 minutes, but we were seated within like 5 minutes which was great considering how busy they were. Were seated and greeted by our waitress who was just amazing. She was just so sweet and polite. Needless to say, their customer service was outstanding! We ordered their lemonade because I love their lemonade. It is exactly how I think lemonade should be which is suuuper sour! We ordered this salad that came with beets, tomatoes, grapefruit and a poppy seed dressing. I don't remember what it was called. Also, we got the mother earth pizza and the roasted corn and added garlic to both. You just cant have pizza with no garlic!  The salad was delicious! just the perfect amount of zest and spice with mild goat cheese! yum! The pizza's were delightful! They were not overbearing with flavor but had enough to give your mouth a kick! I think we got the wrong pizza's last time because these ones were perfect! I loved the mother earth pizza more than the corn though.   After we stuffed our faces with that delicious food, I was ready for dessert. I got the red velvet cake that was paired with their coconut gelato. Of course that was my favorite part of the whole thing! Their red velvet cake was so moist and the icing was creamy and sweet! So yummy! as for the coconut gelato, it was PHENOMENAL! BEST gelato I have had. It tasted like actual coconuts and there was shredded coconut in there for a extra kick in the texture! Yummmm!  Anyway, So I am officially a fan of LGO! They went above and beyond to win me over and I am a permanent customer. Cant wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for a cookie,  wound up with 2 scoops of gelato, 1/2 price at happy hour. Exotic flavors, but I chose the peanut butter chocolate chunk, chocolate chunk mint. Delish"}
{"text":"My husband and I were. In town for our wedding anniversary and felt like getting some pizza. After reading the reviews on Yelp we decided to try LGO... OMG we made the right decision! We had the sweetest most attentive server (Hay). Their homemade lemonade was phenomenal! It was sweet followed by a shot of sour. We decided to share the \"Gladiator\" (we added prosciutto, spicy Fresno peppers and garlic) our jaws dropped when our food arrived. It was seriously the best pizza we've ever had in our entire lives! The flavors were incredible and you could tell how fresh all of the ingredients were. We were so tempted to order a second pizza after we finished the first. This restaurant makes us both beyond sad that we don't live in town and we began thinking up excuses to visit so we can have another visit to this one of a kind restaurant."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We went here with a group and kids. Great Pizza spot to come with the kids and not sacrifice quality! Love the different selection and great atmosphere..I loved everyone I ordered surprisingly liked the one with avocado on it."}
{"text":"Not what I remembered... We haven't been to LGO in awhile since going vegan, but went in tonight to try their vegan pizza with cashew cheese. It was delicious, but there is no mention on the menu about an upcharge for making a pizza vegan and that's just shady business. Unfortunately, that's not the thing that's changed. What used to be a date night / adult spot has turned into a playground. Until we left around 9:30, there were children at every table, babies crying and kids screaming and running around. \"Where are all of their parents?\", was the question of the night. I can put up with untrained servers and questionable business practice for good vegan pizza, but I'm not going back if the majority of the crowd is under 12 and caffeinated. No thank you."}
{"text":"The first time I had the \"fallen angel\" pizza I thought it was good.  The fennel flavor came through nicely and the sausage was plentiful and I felt it was worth the $14.  Popped in the other night as we were trying to decide if we should make the 2 hour drive home or spend the night in PHX.  Ordered the \"fallen angel\" and this time it wasn't duplicated, lacked flavor, minuscule amount of sausage and the crust was really chewy.   We ordered a fish sandwich for take-away.  It had a very fishy smell that permeated through the packaging on our way to our lodging.  Our hostess who we had ordered it for declared it overcooked, but than I should know better than to order fish for take-away and from a facility that really doesn't do fish, unless you count the tuna."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange Pizzeria has the best pizza in Phoenix.  There, I said it.  If you are from out of town and searching Yelp for the best pizza from the plethora of pizza places (what is up with all the pizza here?) in the area, search no more.  Trust me.  My wife and I went to all the places including the coveted Pizzeria Bianco; Base Pizza (awesome view); and Federal Pizza.  We tried chains like Grimaldi's Pizza (surprisingly good!), too.  In addition, we tried the pizza at the hot and new Mora Italian (not worth it and the pizza was subpar) and other local places like Wink 24 (pizza was paper thin, get lasagna).  None of them compare to La Grande Orange Pizzeria.  Their cheese, which they make, is extremely favorable.  It reminds me of the cheese on pizza when I was kid.  Whatever they do, it is perfect.  The sauce is perfect, too.  My wife ordered her standard; cheese and basil (but not a Margherita) and was delighted when it came out covered in basil.  Her pizza was green!  The basil was fresh and strong.  We are still talking about how much basil they gave.  I had a Gladiator pizza and added spicy Fresno chilis to one half and onions to the other.  It was out of this world.  If you are wondering, I liked the onion side better.  The homemade sausage on the pie was a culinary treat.  Other items we tried included the Shredded Kale Salad & Quinoa and the Chips and Dips Plate.  Like the pizza, the salad was excellent.  The chips and dips were good, too.  I was very curios, but was not able to find out about their salsa.  It was probably the best salsa I've had.  Their guacamole was a bit plain for me, but the house-made pimento cheddar dip was a treat.  Our server was a bit spacey, but overall the service was great.  We appreciated that you could walk next door to their market and buy a bottle of wine.  They waive the corkage fee.  It is the way to go if your table plans to have more than a couple glasses of wine.  When in Phoenix, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food for every Foodie!  Baked goods are incredible, they have some delicious gluten free choices too.  I've only been here for breakfast, but have never left unhappy.  I've enjoyed the commuter with smoked salmon and la croix madame! YUM!  Only thing that would make it better would be lower prices."}
{"text":"So yummy!!!! The chicken hash was amazing! The commuter sandwich was yummy as well. Also got the chai iced latte as well. We will be back as it was my first time here. I want to try the desserts next time."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Free veggies and ranch for kids, awesome pizza, and the best growler deals ever!"}
{"text":"LGO is awesome! The only thing that could make them better is if they served their pizza all the time. I think it is only available after 5 or 6 pm. They tend to be busy around dinner time, but trust me the wait is worth it, plus you can wonder around the shop next door and buy some cool nic-nacks, wine or coffee. They also have a counter to order food from if you don't want to sit down and you can take your food to go.   We have eaten here several times and love it! I love trying different types of hot wings, and theirs are awesome! They are a flavor you are sure to enjoy and cannot get anywhere else. Perfectly spicy with that kick in the back of your throat and tons of flavor.   You must check out their win list, tons to choose from and all price point anyone can afford to buy a bottle. We got a yummy Malbec that was only $13.99. Winning! After we enjoyed some wings we shared a couple pizzas.... The Gladiator (sausage, pepperoni and basically meat lovers) and a Margarita. Both amazing! The crust is perfection. I wanted to finish the whole thing, but couldn't.... I had to leave room for some dessert. We shared the Sea Salt Cookie with vanilla gelato, wow so good, I had to ask someone to remove it from the table so I didn't turn into a complete glutton.   Moral of the story, LGO is awesome... and I hear there is one in the air port now, sweet!"}
{"text":"OMG.  Really?  So LGO responded to my review with a picture of raw chicken they served me.  I gave it a few weeks and tried something else off the menu.   There have simply been too many misfires from them for me to keep trying.   Here is our conversation:   Hello Esteban, thanks for reaching out. We appreciate when our loyal fans point out something they think is below our standard. Be assured, we are very concerned about undercooked chicken. We bake the wings for two hours and always use thermometers to verify the temperature is correct before we grill them to order. Often with the high-quality chicken we use, the meat is quite pink near the bone. However, we've clearly proven we're human and have made our share of mistakes. Our culinary team is looking into the inconsistencies you described. We'd like to invite you back in to let us know how we're doing, can you send me your email so we can send you an Ecomp for a future visit? Thanks again and hope to hear from you soon.  Regards,  Hillary Owen Compliance Manager LGO Hospitality //  Hi Hillary.  I'm done.  I just ate the most god-awful Rueben sandwich ever in my life.  My daughter brought it home for me for lunch.  The pastrami is black.  No, not just the rind, all of it.  Tastes like it's been around for a while.  Same for the cole slaw.  The pineapple slice garnish that came with it doesn't even taste like pineapple.  It's hugely disappointing to me that your quality has dropped so substantially.  Thanks for the offer of a freebie, but I'm not interested, I just want the quality food you once provided.  I'm guessing that is not going to happen."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great salad. We had the shredded kale and quinoa salad. Very delicious! Had the gladiator pizza and the Rocket Man with pepperoni. Our waitress was lots of help. Finished off with a brownie and vanilla gelato. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite new American/Neapolitan Pizza place ever. If that's your favorite kind of pizza, this is definitely the place for you! I got half Classic Margarita and the other half was the rocket man and added pepperoni on top. Very tasteful. As for beers, we got the pizza port and it is very complementary with the pizza.  NOTE: the turtle cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Wow,  I haven't been on a date here but if I find one I'm going here on date number 2.  Why, because I would look smooth and spontaneous.  If we need to wait for our table I'll take her by the hand and go to the grocery store connected to La Grande Orange to pick a bottle of wine.    Dress: A bit above casual, I wore my crocks and was not totally out of place.  If you dress up you won't be out of place either.    Pass Reviews, the only low star reviews. Jason R. step out of the box, not all restaurants should be the same. Sheila, Vale parking is cheap right behind the restaurant.   Jason c. Dominos said your a great customer."}
{"text":"Place is really good...just wish they had fountain sodas!!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in doe a quick treat and was helped by the rudest employee I've ever encountered at LGO. She didn't smile once, seemed annoyed to serve me and then waded up my receipt and when I asked for it she was like oh here and handed me the waded up receipt. This was after the other employees while asking other customers around me didn't even ask if I needed help or was waiting for food, just walked away ignoring me. Their customer service has definitely gone way down in recent months as has many of their bakery treats Such a disappointment. They use to be such a wonderful, friendly customer service orientated establishment with fabulous food and a fun gift shop. Hope things improve at some point.  RESPONSE TO BUSINESS'S RESPONSE: The personal attack in response to my negative review is inappropriate and goes against everything that Yelp does stand for. Yelp is a forum for the good and the bad and companies should never attack reviewers. My complaints over the volume of LGO's music have no baring on my recent Yelp reviews for your business as my last contact with LGO Corporate was back in March. My reviews come from experiences of poor food and my one experience of an employee who did not fit with the normal happy, go-lucky employees I have grown very accustom to at LGO. Despite any issues I have had with LGO, I continued to frequent the establishment and have had a couple poor experiences that I chose to Yelp about because I miss the amazing morning bun and other wonderful pastries and hoped management would address the concerns. I find it crazy that initially I was offered an e-comp and then instead of receiving that, i was attacked because I chose to Yelp about my experiences inside the store after filing a complaint months ago with corporate about something completely different and unattached to my Yelp reviews. In my first Yelp review although i gave a low score due to the lack of consistency with food I also wrote, \"...this place is truly wonderful and has great employees\" And in both reviews I stated I hoped that it would improve at some point. Either way personal attacks are unwarranted."}
{"text":"It's back!  So happy to say I had lunch here today and some of the veggie options are back on the menu!  Way to go LGO, thanks for listening to your customers and offering a variety of menu items that satisfy even the vegetarians :) Thanks"}
{"text":"An eccentric area that is a grocery, deli, pizzeria, and restaurant combined into one place. It reminded of the smaller neighborhood markets in Seattle or SF. Having eaten at the nearby Ingo's Tasty Food I had high hopes for the pizza here and my takeout Mushroom Party didn't disappoint. Loaded with mushrooms, garlic, and sweet onions it was a white pizza that had an abundance of veggies and flavor without being too heavy. One minor thing to nitpick was the crust of the pizza which was a tad too chewy.  My friend, who ordered the Gladiator, wasn't a big of fan of his pizza as the meat pizza with sausages and pepperoni looked a bit undertopped. The sausage while good was the only noticeable topping on the pizza.  I definitely want to come back and check out the other offerings that La Grande Orange serves up. They also have an airport location so I'm looking to try out the sandwiches and breakfast items there as well.   As for the pizza it satisfied my cravings but I probably won't rush back due to the fact that its a bit pricey and wasn't blown away. ($32 for 2 pies) It's a solid product but can't compete to the artisan pizza that places like Pizetta 211 turns out in the outer boroughs of SF."}
{"text":"I definitely didn't love this restaurant like other \"yelpers\". I do like the idea that all of the owners spots are right in the same area, especially 3 right in a block's distance and another right up the street.   Got the wings to start, they do have a good amount of chicken on them, but the sauce didn't do it for me. I also tried the pizza and hamburger. I have read before that they have the BEST burger in the area. I did not think it was the best, but I also didn't order the green chili burger, which was the one I read so much about. To me the pizza was very basic, but I know others have enjoyed it.   I was not completely disappointed with my experience, but I'm not rushing to go back either."}
{"text":"Went for pizza but they do not make those until 4pm on weekdays?!?!? I thought she was joking.... nope. Had a good sandwich- just not what we had planned."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!!!  A friend had a get together here. We sat down and were greeted by the server who was very friendly and attentive. She took our drink order and we had the white sangria which was light fresh and sweet.  I ordered the roasted corn pizza which was mozzarella, goat cheese, roasted corn, and basil and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were living in AZ up until recently, and we loved this place. It was a late-night, gourmet standby for us. Their crust and toppings are out of this world. Heirloom tomatoes, roasted garlic... all those extra little touches that come together to make something really marvelous. Can't say enough good things about the food, service, and all that good stuff...  They make their own ICE CUBES that take forever to melt and keep your drink from getting all gross and watery, but make it icy cold. Arizona BONUS!  Go. Enjoy. The grocery/gift shop next door is fun and funky. Everything from homemade English muffins (crumpets) to t-shirts printed with old, out-of-print book covers like Pride and Prejudice and the Great Gatsby."}
{"text":"Had a first date here and didn't know it at the time. Don't live in Phx anymore, and don't live with the girl anymore. Some of the best pizza I ever had. We shared a Margarita pizza......delicious. Yea, best pizza and she is still one of my best friends. Great place to eat, great place to shop next door."}
{"text":"This place has become \"that spot\" for my partner and I. They have hosted many of our first dates as well as other special occasions over the years. It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Drink the white sangria. Eat the margarita Pizza. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley! I wish they had a better salad selection... The Cesar is pretty fishy and the other salads aren't very good. But the pizza is truly incredible, we usually get an extra one to go so we can eat it the next day. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! always get the margarita pizza with the wings! Amazingly delicious and tasty! The attached grocery store is so adorable and love getting a bottle of wine to have at dinner there or red velvet cupcake after dinner on our way out! Last time I visited they had a free mini wine tasting in the bar area which was fun while we waited for our table. The customer service, food, décor and ambiance is a hit here, a must try if you havnt already!"}
{"text":"There are few things I love more than pizza. Its versatility gives you the leeway to combine interesting new ingredients, change the flavor and thickness of the crust, dress it up, or just keep it simple. I could eat pizza for every meal of the day - and have!  The pizza at LGO is really just what I needed this week.   LGO is fantastic. Their pizzas are very nicely done. They have really tasty combinations, like the fallen angel with local Schreiner's sausage, peppers, and fennel (fave!) or the rocket man with chiles and broccolini. The crust has a good flavor, and is thin and crisp. The servers are great, and the decor is fun and comfy- love the flowers. I've always wanted to try the wings, but am a sucker for the pizza.   When I come to LGO, my favorite thing to do is order my pizza at the LGO Grocery, shop around the fun selection of wines, pastas, cheeses, plants, novelties, and pastries, and then eat on the patio, or even in the back of the store. A very friendly ambiance, and otherwise a really great menu. Best yet, you can pick out a tasty treat for dessert, grab a bottle of wine and make yourself a nice little meal. The pizza at LGO is good, so go try it!"}
{"text":"Rating LGO is hard because they have a mix of good things and not so good things.   Good things - the tea is amazing and the bakery is by far the best place to go in the area. I'm not sure what the cake is but it's a white cake with coconut to preorder and it truly is the best thing I've ever had. The store itself is also excellent and so fun to browse around.   Bad things - I'm not a fan of the breakfast sandwich's but really wanted to like the commuter sandwich."}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my lady here for her first time but soon realized we should've just eaten at home. This used to be a cool spot. Now, it's just following all the bad trends a typical 'for profit' business does. What a shame."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing! Gluten free pizza- amazing! Sourdough pizza crust- amazing!  But tonight's chef special was out of this world. Close your eyes and imagine --- a grilled artichoke appetizer with a delicious garlic aioli, followed by sautéed asparagus in a garlic oil {dipped in the left over aioli was good too}, and then to finish- an amazing culinary blend of chicken sausage, figs, ricotta cheese, and arugula pizza. *mind blown * now to top it all off with gelato!!!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza I have ever had. And the kale salad and sangria were equally amazing.  My husband's favorite, though, was the peanut butter gelato."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about LGO from friends for years so I finally decided to give it a try. My sister and I went on a Friday after work, we used the complimentary valet and went inside and were immediately seated. I'm really not a very picky person when it comes to food or drinks. However, when I had a sip of the lemonade I felt like a baby tasting a lemon for the first time it was incredibly sour. To be sure it wasn't just me I had my sister taste it and she immediately made a sour face. I added two packets of Splenda and more water and it was still incredibly sour. I ended up just asking the server to switch my drink to an iced tea because the lemonade was too sour which she quickly did. Now let's move on to the food; my sister and I shared. We ordered a plate of fries as our appetizer which were crispy and came with a sauce that was really good. For our main course we ordered a pizza half Fallen Angel and half Gladiator. Our food came out fairly quickly and looked good. The pizza was okay and I liked the fallen Angel  better than the Gladiator. Was it the best pizza I've ever had? No. My biggest complaint about the pizza was that every time I went to pick up a slice everything fell right off the slice and onto my plate so I had to keep putting he toppings back on my crust. Overall, our server was great she was polite and attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere was nice, the music not too loud, and the tables were not crowded together. I was actually shocked at how reasonable the price ended up being about $25 for two drinks, fries and a pizza. While I wasn't blown away by the food I will likely return at some point in the future to re-evaluate the food as my expectations may have been set far to high due to my friend's raving.   P.S-I did take a peek at market and felt as if the little knick knacks were fairly overpriced. They were charging $14 for an identical set of coasters I had seen earlier that day at Michaels on sale for $2.50 originally $5."}
{"text":"My friend has raved about this place for months, so for her birthday the girls and I got together for a little pizza field trip to LGO. It was amazing! Just as good as Mozza Pizzeria in LA., but around 400 miles closer. I also love the little grocery store. Very cute things to buy."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and sangria. Has a market nearby with random unique items. The bakery is delicious. The \"morning pastries\" are half off come night time and are still good to eat!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Arcadia for a relaxing and cheap breakfast, lunch, or pizza. They have some really good and healthy food on the menu as well. Go to for breakfast is the commuter with salmon, avocado, havarti. It's super good. For lunch I love the chickpea lettuce wraps. Dinner time you can't beat the prosciutto and avocado pizza. The place also has a great ambiance and setup for casual socializing. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Fun place that's pretty quaint. Came in not too long ago for a takeout pizza, got the full vegetarian pizza with chicken added to it. Was good, but not my favorite. I need to try the other pizzas for sure though! I also came in for a glass of wine one night with a few friends, and that was nice. The server was nice and friendly even though all we were ordering were a few bottles of wine around the table. My boss loves the salad so I'll have to try their salad some time too! Lots of options!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Valley. This place is very trendy, has a marketplace feel, but also authentic. We went on a Sunday morning around 11 and it was craaazy busy as we expected. It took about 30 minutes to go through the line and then find a table for 2. I love that you can buy bottles of alcohol here! I found one of my favorite drinks in the fridge, Framboise sparkling lambic beer. I always get The Commuter w/ Avocado. Their rustic breads are great, the English muffins are buttery and delicious. They sell Tammy Coe baked goods and if you know anything about her, you know that her baking is the bomb. I have never had a more flavorful and moist blueberry muffin in my life. I love the curbside service for to-go orders. The iced honey latte is yummy."}
{"text":"A great place!  Like many other non-corporate pizzarias, this is not fast-food.  I am not sure if LGO is part of the slow-food movement, but when I am here my expectations are not to get in and get out fast.  I like to slow down, enjoy my beverage, relax.  When the food is ready it never dissappoints.    I like to the see Lambroginis parked next to beat up Hundais in the parkling lot too.  The place is good enough for the Arcadian elite, and just fine for me and the rest of us peasants too!  The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.  If you hype the place up too much to your friends, they may be disappointed.  Think of it as a nice place to go, go there, and enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"This is a true restaurant landmark in Phoenix.  Their breakfast is second to none in the valley.   I typically get the commuter with sausage...good lord!  My wife gets some kind of healthy egg-white turkey dish... she loves it."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. LGO. Not only is their food amazing (lunch AND dinner), but they have the most adorable little shop you can walk around while you wait for your food (and trust me, you'll wait). If you go for lunch, try the chicken salad sandwich with sliced apples...mmm! Their coffee is also bomb. Nestled in the village of Arcadia, this little gem offers something for everyone.   Overall, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary to frequent this place after you discover its existence--it's that good."}
{"text":"The crust makes the pizza and this deserves 10 stars.  The desserts are delightful.  There a constant crowd, yet easy to find a seat.  Definitely worth every bite."}
{"text":"Came here straight from the airport (visiting from New York). Such a cute spot! The wings was great. The Rossetti chicken next door at the grocery was great. Staff are all very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"They've got the right stuff!! I'm a huge fan of their corn pizza! I was immediately impressed by their hot moist towels upon receiving food. It's nice and refreshing. If you order regular coke, it'll be in a glass bottle and regular diet coke will be in a plastic bottle. Great ambiance and scenery! Well priced pizzas!"}
{"text":"LGO is THE BEST pizza place in town... wait, in the country... wait, in the world!!! It is as good, if not better than Pizzeria Bianco too (minus the 4 hr wait). The sourdough crust is what makes the pizza, as do the high quality topics. My fave are avocado pizza with prosciutto, the mushroom one, and the gladiator (with sausage). Their breakfast, sandwich, and salad menus are excellent as well! It's fun to hang out in the \"grocery\" store next door where you can get good cheese, wine, bread, and little kitschy things. Their white sangria is the BOMB! And you can't beat the $6 bloodys and mimosas on the weekends. With the family-friendly laid back atmosphere and fun for all, this is a true Phoenix gem."}
{"text":"If you like overpriced food that really isn't that good, a wait staff that is snobby and a cliental that is a bunch of want-a-bees that somehow paying too much for food feeds their egos and makes them feel good about themselves.  This is the place for you."}
{"text":"I have been to the grocery store a few times and to the restaurant once. The grocery store sells this really good pistachio gelato and some interesting wines. The service was always good but the lines were ever-present when I visited (weeknights).   My experience at the restaurant was good. My date and I had the pizza I think, and even though we had to sit at the bar because of the crowds, it was a decent experience and I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to change up their usual restaurant choice for a night."}
{"text":"I get it: I just don't think that much of it.  Dropped by for a late lunch. Pizza is very good and salads are generous. Customers place orders at a counter on one side of the house (a store-like setting jamb-packed with various pricey food and gift items). Pizza-man then shouts your name over the crowd when your order is ready. It's open seating in the dining hall, and it appears one needs to ask for the tables to be bussed if they aren't clean when you sit down. There was one busser that was being kept far too busy this Sunday afternoon.  For what they're charging you can get about equal quality at a place like NYPD Pizza and experience actual table service. What you won't get is the opportunity to spend $38 on a ultra-special insulated sports bottle with the LGO logo on it. It's the perfect way to tell everyone in Arcadia that you have $38 to spend on a sports bottle.  Thirty-Eight dollars.  . ."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings! The pizza is always good. I order the roasted corn pizza and the blue cheese wings and it's my favorite. They have a great menu with plenty of choices to delight! Great customer service, curb pickup, seated dining. I love LGO pizzeria! It's super!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. The wait usually sucks and the parking is always horrible.  Last time I was here, they messed up my order bad and I didn't realize until I had driven off. Keep your receipt in case they mess it up!"}
{"text":"Saying the food was amazing would fall short.  We had the spinach apple salad and the avocado pizza. I was skeptical of having avocado on my pizza, but had to try it. I was not disappointed. It was the best pizza I have ever had. As for the salad, I am not a big salad eater. Only eat salad to try and be healthy. But this salad was so good there was nothing left on my plate. Same went for the pizza.  I would strongly recommend this place. And make sure to check out the attached market."}
{"text":"What a cute place! If I lived in the Phoenix area, LGC (as Gabi K calls it) and I would be good friends. It seems to have so many personalities -- all of them fabulous. I only was able to enjoy a \"lunch-to-go\" here, and it didn't disappoint. I have the Chopped Pizza Salad and sushi along with some tasty iced tea. There seem to be some many items in the market cum deli com pizzaria cum wine spot, that I needed more time to explore them all. Biggest surprise? They have bottled their own maple syrup!   Next time I must try those cupcakes. they looked YUM-MY!"}
{"text":"See the blog for photos and the review of La Grande Orange Grocery for my thoughts on myriad other items from La Grande Orange group.  This one is specific to the menu items within the Pizzeria and will be updated as I try more.  All things being equal, I love this place.  Baked Chicken Wings with Point Reyes Blue Cheese:  From the \"LGO Pizzeria\" menu that begins service at 4pm on weekdays and 11am on weekends it'd be hard for me to imagine a better way to watch football in a public space than at La Grande Orange.  Not a fan of bars, beers, or greasy bites LGO offers up a tasteful menu of traditional American gameday fare highlighted by these $1/ea. seared, seasoned, baked to order wings.  Featuring organic chicken, plenty of heat, and just a bit of char what really sets these wings apart is how plump and juicy they remain even without frying and also the dressing - a sort of \"ranch\" with subtle sourness, lots of chives, and big chunks of bleu cheese throughout.  LGO Pizzeria Pizza - Half Classic Margherita and Half Roasted Corn with Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Corn, roasted tomatoes, and basil:  An interesting pie to say the least, what strikes me most about LGO's pizza is the crust - a sort of sourdough starter that the team is making when the place opens at 6:30am and allowing to rise on the counter as lunch/dinner approaches.  Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo (particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out) the structure remains supple with a great chew.  Much more willing to go half/half than the vast majority of high end pizzerias these days I found the Margherita as good as the ingredients, though they went a bit light on the tomatoes for my tastes while the Roasted corn was excellent, the smoky sweetness of the corn proving a perfect foil to the punchy chevre."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down!  The food is excellent and the service is fast.  Parking may suck and it's always always busy here, but it is worth it...trust me.  I highly recommend the kale and quinoa salad - my favorite salad in town!  Also try the avocado pizza with prosciutto - yum!  A friend of mine is gluten-intolerant.  Since we usually share a pizza, I've tried the gluten-free crust.  I must say it is the best gluten-free crust I've had anywhere in Phoenix.  Before you leave, get a French sea salt chocolate chip cookie (to die for) and a package of their house made English muffins.  If you haven't been to LGO yet, you are missing out on a gem!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at LGO Grocery and tonight was my first night dining in and ordering a pizza. It was BUSY but the service was excellent. My waiter informed me that their pesto is vegan, made w/o parmesan cheese! I asked him if he was sure, LOL, and he said he absolutely is because they use the pesto as a base for many of their vegan pizzas. That was so awesome. Of course I ordered it and I was so impressed. It was delicious. My mom had a mushroom pizza and she was very satisfied as well. I can't wait to be back and I am so glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Great food and cool options within the shop. Love the cheese pizza (for when I'm feeling Kevin Mccallister nostalgia)! The salted brownie is amazing."}
{"text":"Very hipster environment. Food is good, but small. Paid $3 for a tablespoon for cottage cheese. The English muffin sandwich was very tasty.  It was very crowded and loud, which I don't care for. They have a market that sold a lot up non food items (Think hipster urban outfitters with some food items). The food was good and I try it again when I have the chance."}
{"text":"Great food and service. A little crowded on the seating. Once I was seated I got crowded in on by other chairs making it very hard to get out."}
{"text":"The quality of the food and of the service barely make one star, which is a sad decline of a once delightful place. The best thing is the location, but for my money the can leave town."}
{"text":"Can't believe I hadn't tried LGO pizza before!   I've heard Phoenix is an unsuspecting spot for some of the best pizza in the country, and the much-raved-about LGO did not disappoint.  We went with the Gladiator pizza to share.. wasn't too cheesy, not too sauce-y. The sausage had a nice bite to it and pepperoni was yummy. Crispy crust and loved the subtle notes of parmesan that came through with every bite. In addition, I also ordered the kale & quinoa salad with rotisserie chicken. WOW! Awesome salad and a solid portion. Loved how all the ingredients jived with one another and the cervil vinagrette dressing was like the cherry on top.   Great set up. I've been in the daytime for their grab-n-go section, and the ambience from day to night is almost a 180 degree difference. Romantic dim lighting (especially in the \"tasting room\" section in back) made for a wonderful setting for dinner. We grabbed a bottle of Malbec to pair with our dinner. For you wine-o's out there: they have a lovely selection of nicely-priced bottles available in the grocery section that they will uncork for you for no additional fee. Holla!  Before leaving, we checked out the grocery/store section..tons of fun, unique and quirky gifts. We also made a stop at the gelato counter. I really liked that they offered miniature portions - it was the perfect sweet cap to a fantastic dinner and experience.  Will return (again and again!)"}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Just not worth the hassle and wait.  High chair was hard to find and once acquired, dirty.  Pizza was fine, but they were very stingy with the basil on the Margarita pizza...it needs more basil.  Tammy Coe dessert was beautiful, but unfortunately the taste did NOT match the beauty.    It's not horrible.  It's just not worth the parking hassle and wait.  There are other Cen Pho restaurants that just do a better job."}
{"text":"This review is long over due from me. I live in Ca and come to Az 3-4 times a year. I am here everyday during my visits. You won't believe the variety of pastries, deserts and cookies. Each is handmade here on site.  Their Cinnamon morning bun is nothing like you have every had and melts in your mouth.  From the commuter breakfast sandwich to coffee, this place is the go to for food made fresh that never disappoints. The staff is friendly and always greets with a smile. The owner has a winner. Next time your in town or whether you live here.  Check this place out. Hats off the head pastry Chef named Cole. He's the best !"}
{"text":"Drove all the way here for what was supposed to be killer food and dessert.  What we got was the following.  ATTITUDE!  Sorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.  The pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?  The desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.  The good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that. The desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.  The bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best.   Will probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley (before you rip my head off, let me disclose that I have yet to try Bianco). LGO also has pretty good burgers, salads and consistently great sangria. Pretty cool, casual atmosphere.  If you're feeling social they have face-to-face seating on both sides a long, community bar.  Best of all, LGO is conveniently located next to the best Gelato in AZ--Arlecchino."}
{"text":"Pizza reviews sounded good, pictures looked great, sign said pizzeria, can't get pizza until 4pm! Very nice to find out after having car valet parked and getting nearly crippled mother to a table. One star because I could not try what we went looking for."}
{"text":"This place is the quintessential neighborhood deli / eatery on weekend mornings, and a fabulous little pizza parlor in the evenings.  It's hard to pull off both in the same location, but La Grande Orange does it amazingly well!  The food is delicious, although a little on the spendy side in my opinion (Think $7.50 - $10 for an egg sandwich, a la carte)They also have tons of little knick knacks, tshirts, and plants for sale, and a little wine shop in the corner!  The only downside is the parking (almost impossible) and the lack of space when it's busy (which is almost always).  But if you don't mind eating your sandwich in a cramped corner next to the door, you're gonna be hard pressed to find anything else you DON'T like about this place.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The dining room always has a weird back of house grease trap smell that pervades the space and overwhelm's what would otherwise be a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Fortunately,  a manager contacted me and offered an email comp to return for another try. We've not made it back yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I'm upping my rating to a three simply because I was surprised by the generous gesture.  I am hopeful that once we return, I can give an honest, positive review on the food and service!"}
{"text":"What a fun spin on a restaurant.  You order at the counter, find a seat and wait for your food.  The sourdough pizza is to die for.  They have some fun combinations or will make anything you want.  Easy to order Togo or to eat in.  Fun, slightly loud music and a trendy crowd.  Make sure to get a dessert when your done.  The French sea salt chocolate chip cookie is to die for.  They also have some fun things to purchase for the home.  Almost bought a candle that smelled amazing, will have to get it next time.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We will wait for a table and drive long distances for what is our favorite pizza in the valley. And what we really loved WAS the spinach apple salad. They took it off the menu.  Why do you mess with success. Go ahead and add the salmon salad, but please bring back our old friend."}
{"text":"Super great meal, as always. I've been coming here for 4 years, and have always loved the food as well as the service. That being said, a very unfriendly new server was (to our utter disgust) was assigned to our table. I have never met anyone this rude in my life. Not only did she mistreat every person at my table, but she ran into another employee, spilled something some on her, pushed away and then rolled her eyes. LGO. I love you but learn to properly train new employees."}
{"text":"Bring back chocolate destruction!!! Best desert ever! Food is good but need to bring back that desert that's why we go."}
{"text":"If you don't like LGO you are just weird...but really  A Few of my favorite things: Commuter Breakfast Sandwich, Croque Madame, Smoked Salmon Salad, Kale and Quinoa Salad, Caesar Salad, Tuna Salad Sammy, Chocolate Chip Cookies with Salt, Any of the pizza's but the roasted corn pizza will change your life.   Fallen Angel is really good if you are looking for one with meat .. yum! Oh and the baked wings.. there are no words! So pretty much anything and everything here is delicious!!   The english muffins are the best you will ever have but probably the most fattening as well, but who cares."}
{"text":"Went Friday night for a late dinner and was pleasantly surprised with their green chili burger.  I have had the pizza and love the cheese with fresno chili's on it.  I was just craving something different.  The menu said they were rated best burgers in Phoenix this year and I do admit they are up there on my list.   I highly recommend stopping in if you never have before or try the burger if you've never done so."}
{"text":"I love this relaxing ambience here. Come here for good pizza and good company. I just love it here. You can also go across the way to the lgo bake shop and grocery store. They have everything!!!! Sweets to wine, shirts, frames and candies. :D which by the way, the red velvet ice cream is heaven!   So. My entrée. The ROCKET MAN pizza is to die for. Actually all their vegetarian pizza is to die for!! yummmmmm. And their CRUST. Really? !?!?! Freaking phenomenal!! Crispy, yet soft to bite off and so tasteful. Oh. And don't forget the hot sauce. You can't eat pizza without hot sauce!!! Sigh. Can I just live here??? Or have this right next to my house. Haha.  I'm always back!!!"}
{"text":"Been going to 'the Orange' for years.  A few weeks ago we ordered curbside takeout....just wanting to put on pjs and watch tv.  I ordered the fresh fish sandwich.  OMG, seriously delicious.  About a week later, I repeated that order.  Seriously cravable sandwich.  Their sonoma salad is truly amazing, but the fish sandwich is a hearty meal!!    If you go in, be prepared to shop - cute stuff, fun stuff, interesting stuff.  And then the bakery case just stares at you, daring you not to get something in there.    Go, just go."}
{"text":"I've been to LGO for breakfast a couple times, but have been waiting years to finally get over there and try the pizza. I wasn't disappointed, and am definitely adding this to my list of absolute favorite pizza places. The crust, cheese, mmmm it was all amazing. LGO is also a really great atmosphere. Only downside is that parking is very difficult and if you don't know those streets very well, it is confusing to know where to park."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is crap. If your looking for a place with good food, fun atmosphere and good service.. This is not your place. The only good thing about this place is they get the food out quick. We went there last night for dinner and enjoyed our meal. My brother in law realized he left his phone at the restaurant so went back to hunt it down. Upon talking with the manager he explained that the phone was absolutely not there. He claimed to have gotten down with a flashlight and looked under and around the table. My brother in law asked him if they could turn the music down just a little to try and hear the phone just to have the ponce manager claim it would \"ruin the esthetics of the restaurant\"... There was a max of 12 people in the restaurant!! After searching around the table for a few minutes they found the phone under the table in the corner that the manager claimed he had already checked.. This kind of \"customer service\" is disgusting and the manager would do good at focusing more on keeping customers happy than HIS esthetics. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Let me just throw this out there right now. Being that this is my first review I just want to let you know that I do not intend to score easy on restaurants, this just happens to be a favorite of mine. So here it goes....  Ever have a day that just seems gloomy, depressing, boring, unfulfilled. Well, the common cure I have found isn't at the pharmacist or the doctor. No, the cure I found happened to be just around the corner at a little pizzeria called, well, pizzeria. This magnificent little joint is attached to the hip of what is known as La Grande Orange grocer. I have to say nothing brings a smile to my face faster than fresh shrimp ceviche followed by sweet corn pizza with sourdough crust and a pitcher of house made white sangria. My wife and I frequent this establishment and have never once left with bad taste. Service has always been exceptional even when the place is slammed with customers. I warn you though, eat all you want but do save room for a slice of peanut butter pie.  I believe the only thing that I've ever had problems with is some of the rude customers, but it's typical behavior of the residents of the area."}
{"text":"OK sums it up.  Margherita pizza swimming in grease. Gladiator was not memorable.  The service was nice, prompt and friendly. The place was clean.  Sorry, not for me. I don't see added value above a good flash-fired pizza."}
{"text":"This was one of the last bookmarked pizza places in Phoenix left on my list.  My buddies had left back to Vegas, and I had an afternoon to myself.  I figured that it would be a perfect time to drive down here and try it out.  I had studied their menu previously, and there was one pizza that stood out above all the rest......The Rocket Man.  I am pretty much allergic to vegetables, but if you throw them on some dough, and bake it, I am down to eat my veggies!  The Rocket Man sounded delicious.  I knew for sure that I was going to get that.  I called in my order and arrived just a few minutes before it was ready.  I found a 25 minute parking spot out front and walked inside.  I paid for my pizza and also ordered a Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I took a seat and a few minutes later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was......................  Rocket Man Pizza ($14.00) -  I had done my research before, and I knew this was going to be a winner.  This pizza comes topped with spicy red Fresno chiles, broccolini, roasted orange peppers, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes.  These toppings are laid upon a super thin sourdough crust.  Side rant.....  Sourdough is my favorite bread.  You could give me some sourdough bread and butter as my last meal, and I would be content and die a happy man.  LGO's sourdough pizza crust is beyond amazing!  The thinness of the crust and the excellent chew and flavor make this one of the best crusts I have ever had.  It was like eating flat sourdough rolls topped with pizza goodies.  Here is why I know it is was so good...... I was still full from lunch when I picked up my pizza.  I sampled 2 small slices right when I got in my car and could have probably polished off the pizza.  This pizza was on point.  One of the best in Phoenix.  Instantly catapulted into my top 3 in the Valley.  The toppings were plentiful, colorful and delicious. All those veggies made the pizza sing!  The \"spicy\" Fresno chiles weren't really spicy at all..still very tasty though.  The peppers, tomatoes, broccolini and garlic were a flavor explosion and added great texture to the pizza, too.  I'm usually not the \"veggie pizza\" type person, but this thing breaks down all stereotypes and preconceived notions on what a veggie pizza should taste like.  I'm still thinking about it.  I took the rest of the pizza home and had 2 slices cold later in the evening.  Still just as good.  That sourdough crust is something else!  A few hours later, I reheated the pizza in the oven for a little bit so that the cheese would melt again and the crust would warm up.  Once again, amazing flavors and still just as good as freshly made.  You know its good when you eat it A. Fresh, B. Cold and C. Reheated.  Each and every occurrence was delicious!  I can preach how good the sourdough crust is until the cows come home.  You just have to go and try it yourself.  As long as you like sourdough bread, I guarantee you will be impressed and instantly fall in love with it!  Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.00) -  I had read about these cookies in all of the Yelp reviews.  I saw them sitting there in the case and knew I had to get one.  $3.00 a cookie seems a bit steep, but these cookies are HUGE and totally worth the  money.  The cookies had a little crunch on the outside and were pretty soft on the inside.  The chocolate wasn't totally melted, but the chocolate chips were soft and easy to chew on.  The salt on top really put this over the top.  You got salty, sweet and savory all in one bite.  These things could become very addictive!  I wish I had ordered a few more of them.  Service was friendly enough.  The store is pretty \"hip\" too.  I was lucky to find parking in the lot (It was about 4pm in the afternoon) and didn't have to wait long for my food to be ready.  I really cannot wait until I come back to eat some more of that sourdough crust.  You could throw some dog shit on top of that crust, and it would still taste good!  Yup...I said it.  Possibly the best pizza crust I have ever had...anywhere....and I have eaten lots and lots of pizza around the country.  Come and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I love me my pizza and salad. I could live on pizza and salad. This place has your basic pizza but they also go off the map too and have some creative combinations. It is pricey. And the parking is not great. Hence the 4 stars and not 5. The LGO grocery right next door is a great place too- see my review of that and Chelsea's Kitchen which is up the street. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"MOST AMAZING PIZZA ANYWHERE!!!! It is excellent every time and we've been eating at LGO for years.  Our favorite is the margerita pizza and of course a few of those delicious chicken wings and if we are feeling terribly sinful, we end with some gelato on the red velvet cake...Oh Lordy...writing this review makes me hungry."}
{"text":"Great coffee, baked goods, and breakfast to go catch up with a friend.  Little gift shop on the grab-and-go side is cute."}
{"text":"The best margarita pizza in town - and we know our pizza. The perfect flavor. Great restaurant with a simple menu and good atmosphere. Fantastic chicken wings, salads and margarita pizza. The sangria is pretty good too. Usually a bit of a wait, but worth it. Can do some browsing at the market next door during your wait and grab Gelatto after."}
{"text":"La Grande Orange is a cool cafe/ grocery store/ coffee house/ pizzeria/ gelato bar. It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one.  I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.) Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy. Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.  There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie. I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one. Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat! (I returned the very next day for more apple pie cookies!)  The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients, so you can see if the item is vegan or allergen-free without having to search for it on the overhead board.  The parking situation is pretty insane. They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building for those who don't mind a short walk."}
{"text":"Neat little grocery store and had the Jersey Girl Omelette... very yummy. I Highly recommend the spot. They also had their own coffee which I will try next time."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the first time I was not impressed. The pizza was okay and I was not a fan of their sangria which is what they are supposed to be known for! I have honestly had better sangria at Olive Garden. However the second time I stayed away from the sangria and had wine which is always great!  The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful. They were very nice the first time I went as well. Perhaps I was not  in the right frame the first time but I will go back again based on my second experience. I orderd the cheese pizza and had the peanut butter pie from the grocery next door. The peanut butter pie is enough to give this place 5 stars! However the pizza was delicious and I hated to share it with my friends! Just goes to prove that you should always give a place a second chance!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza in AZ. For many years I have been coming here and ordering the roasted corn pizza and gladiator. I've tried a few of their sandwiches but I always need to get my sourdough crust pizza fix with fresh ingredients. This is such a great Arcadia staple and have introduced a lot of people to this place. Parking is the only thing that gets me in a tizzy. Another thing is that they do not start baking pizzas until after 4pm during the weekday."}
{"text":"Entertaining the folks in PHX for a last meal together before the red eye back to Florida...major delivery from LGO!  Will definitely return next time thru PHX...which won't be soon enough.  If you have to drive even 30-40 mins to get here...it will be worth it.  Aaron served two seniors and two kiddos as part of our group of seven...and didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"Grilled artichokes are always a great start for any meal. Fallen angel pizza was very tasty, but crust was a bit too thin. But the LGO dessert which is presented like a large Hostess cupcake with gelato on the side was really good. Thick chocolate chunk topping, fresh whipped cream in lieu of vanilla cream, and super moist chocolate cake was amazing. We sided it with coconut gelato, just the perfect ending!"}
{"text":"I am slacking.  This is seriously one of the BEST places in PHX and I have yet to review it!  This place cares about its food and about Arcadia.    I come here for the pizza but their menu is amazing for flavor.  My go to pizza is a cheese with extra cheese and a fried egg on top.  Seriously, if you order pizza, any of the pizzas, ask for the fried egg on top.  There is something about the way the yolk mixes with the cheese and the perfectly savory yet sweet tomato sauce.  Some small caveats about LGO, first being table service.  On the weekends they have servers in the dining area and serve only off the dining menu.  Any other time, or if you want to order off the grocery menu, you need to order at the counter on the Grocery side.  The Grocery Side will call your name when your food is ready but all tables on the dining side are reserved for sit down eating on the weekends.  Also, parking is a pain because the main lot is meant for 25 min parking.  Complimentary valet service is available, but I hate being forced to valet when there are perfectly good spaces to park in.   A nice option for us winos, you can buy any bottle of wine on the Grocery side and enjoy it on the Dining side!  No corking fee, no $30+ for a bottle of wine (unless you want to order at $30 bottle of wine), and you can cork and take home whatever you do not finish.  Don't even get me started on the bakery case, just buy it all!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, after moving to the PHX area it took me a little while to figure out what everyone was talking about when they said \"LGO\"... but I am sure glad I figured it out!  All of the food is, in a word, delicious.  Heck, now you can even find LGO deliciousness at the airport!  Good stuff -- check it out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"We love this place, it's sure thing, the food and service are great.  The wings are delicious, messy.. but they serve them with wet napkins to clean up after.   My boyfriend always gets the pizza, he thinks its one of the best in Arcadia, and I have to agree.      I also LOVE the Caesar salad here, it's one of my favorite Caesars and I eat a lot of them.  I highly recommend the artichoke as well, french fries, and I'll stop there....  I've never had a bad meal here, this spot is in regular rotation for us, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The peanut butter pie! Start with that! It's supposed to be a take on PB&J, but I skipped the strawberry gelato. Instead, I did the salted caramel gelato. That was definitely the way to go! By far the best thing of ever put my mouth. Ever.  Now that you've had dessert, feel free to browse the rest of the menu. I had the Sonoran salad (I think that's what it was called). It had poppyseed dressing, goat cheese, toasted almonds, roasted beets and heirloom tomatoes. So good!  I also tried the avocado pizza. I know it sounds weird, but if you love avocados as much as I do, you'll love the pizza! I added on chicken because it doesn't come with any meat. I'm sure you can add on whatever kind of meat you want. The crust is out of this world!  If any of you gentlemen out there need someone to come and accompany you to La Grande Orange, I'm your gal! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"To start, the chicken wings are fantastic.  The pizza is good as well. I prefer either the cheese pizza or the \"Gladiator\" pizza (sausage and pepperoni).  Burgers -- whether it be the cheeseburger or \"Hurricane Fish Sandwich\" -- are excellent.  The food is simple, but remarkably delightful.  My only problem with LGO's pizzeria is parking (or rather, lack thereof). This is especially true if you visit at peak-dinnertime hours.  And don't be the dude (or chick) that parks in a curbside parking spot -- without the intention of using cURBSIDE SERVICES -- only to spend two hours eATing INSIDE!!!! Use the valet, please.  Thank you."}
{"text":"A very nice atmosphere. I brought a friend to this place to try it out. Service was good and had friendly staff. I ordered the fallen angel and was just a fantastic pizza. My friend ordered there burger and said that she really liked it. Nothing short of a great place to go to."}
{"text":"Can't believe I havent given one of my favorite spots a review. Regular here and a big fan!  Came here friday night and was nice and busy (usual in good places lol). High top in the bar was open so we snatched that up.   Service was perfect as always. Attentive but not overly annoying.   We got a pizza, caesar salad and a big ol' plate of french fries (BEST fries in the world...no seriously...) and everything came out perfect  I wish wish wish they wouldnt use chunky sauce on the pizza but other than that, the pizza is fantastic!! Sour dough crust. Sign me up"}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my last review, and I must say, LGO is still good, but not as good as the first time. The pizza is still good, I like the thin crust and the inventive toppings. They just haven't been quite as good as they used to be. The caprese salad isn't that special one that I had the first time either....sigh. You know what still is delicious? That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. I don't love the forced valet parking....why can't we just park? aaanyway, I would not say that LGO is the best pizza in Phoenix, but it is still a solid choice."}
{"text":"Just finished eating the Gladiator and we are very pleased with all aspects here. Great service and the food has amazing flavor! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"went over the thanksgiving holiday and loved it (I have been here several times before, but I beleive this may be my first review).  We had salads, pizzas, and desert and LOVED everything.  Phoenix is lucky to have such a cool restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time yesterday. Amazing pizza. Definitely will be back.  I had the avocado pizza and the mushroom party with added bacon."}
{"text":"I have yet to taste anything that is bad here! Great breakfast sandwiches. Did I mention that they make their English muffins in house? To die for. I wish I lived closer to buy them to just make at home!  The pizza is great, airy crust and great sauce. I know it sounds stupid, but the pepperoni are so big that they pull everything off with them. First world problems and personal preference I suppose.  Their gelato is just pure heaven... I would buy it by the gallon if I could!! I had the peanut butter chocolate and it was fantastic. I can't wait to try other flavors!  Their location is always busy, I can't seem to find a time to go there and not be in a crowd. Great for them!! However, with the crowded store it makes it uncomfortable while waiting in line, there's no where to really wait for your food. The store knick-knacks are cool but there's just so many that it's just overwhelming. The seating area is the same, very crowded and hard to move between tables. It's a great problem to have, but definitely need to figure out how to handle their large numbers of fans!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of my fav places in Phoenix! Cutest little accessories to look at while in line. Plus the food and lemonade is great! In the spring, sit out side and enjoy the outdoors. Parking is horrible, valet makes it alot better."}
{"text":"Great place and great food.  Very good wine selection and the wine is priced retail same price if you bring it home or drink it there. All price and some great wuakit"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The kale salad is wonderful! Love the classic Coke in a bottle as well. The atmosphere was great. Only hang up was parking."}
{"text":"The parking lot is terrible. But it's Worth the hype! The food is very well priced. Anywhere from $7 to $12 for a meal which is pretty good for breakfast. You can order pretty much anything here and not go wrong. Great food!!! Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in Arizona!  I'm also a huge fan of sourdough, so it is pretty perfect for me!!!  My favorite is the thin sausage pizza.  So yummy!!!  Parking is a pain and the wait staff isn't the friendliest.  I came in yesterday with my two daughters pretty early in the evening.  Our waitress picked up my daughters plate before she was even finished, cleaned up the entire table while we were still sitting there, and even took all the napkins.  I needed the napkins to wipe their hands after eating pizza...why would you take brand new, clean napkins away when I have two small kids with me?"}
{"text":"Love everything I've ever ordered here from the eggs and homemaker ENGLISH muffins to the yogurt parfaits, pizza and sandwiches. My favorite treat is the Sea salted chocolate chip cookies!!! The gift shop has great gifts for girlfriends and teen daughters!!"}
{"text":"First off,  we ordered our pizza in the Phoenix airport between flights. As for airport pizza this is a 7 star. I really was not existing such delicious pizza. Palatable, yes I had hoped for that thanks to use of a brick oven.   We ordered a margherita with fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes. I'm usually iffy on sliced tomatoes on pizza. But these were good.   But that's just toppings. Toppings can be good or bad. But they really don't make a pizza. The sauce and the crust are what defines a truly great pizza.   First the sauce was good. Not too sweet. Not laid on too heavy. Just the right balance to add a touch of moistness.   Now the crust. Beautifully thin. With some crispness near the edges and softer breadiness in the middle. Most importantly no part of the crust was doughy or uncooked. Which is a common problem of many pizzas -even if the average Joe isn't realizing that is a major factor of influence.   The crust even had some beautiful bubbles. Two of which were lightly charred. And that is a measure of perfection in my book. A good pizza has two lightly charred bubbles of crust. They should NOT be burnt to the point of being inedible. Just charred.   The price was $12-$13 for a small pizza. Which is a touch pricey. However, this was afterall inside the airport where a can of Coke is $3. So I'm not really going to knock them on price. And wager their normal stores fall into the average $$ range.   I'd say my biggest disappointment is that our flight started boarding or I'd have ordered a second pie. Probably try one of their meat pies.   I'd probably put La Grande Orange in the top 10 pizza pies. So now that I've said that, let me give you some background and street cred. I come from New Haven, CT arguably the pizza capitol of the world. We have three pizzarias that consistently rank in the top. Pepe's is probably ranked #1 more consistently than any other pizzaria in America. In fact in a recent scoring New Haven pizzarias placed #1, #7 and #11. NYC being the only city to have more top rated. But mind you NYC has 10x the population of little ol' New Haven.   So when I review a pizza I'm highly critical. And very few earn a 5 star rank. So good job La Grande Orange for surprising me with good pizza in Phoenix of all places (and an airport to boot). And yes I'd put this pie in my top 10 list. That is saying a lot....  Did I mention they had what looked to be fresh squeezed orange juice as well? Also, I saw a number  of reviews comment about the pizza being gluten free. If true even more kudos, and then I could proclaim La Grande Orange to be the #1 gluten free pizza pie."}
{"text":"Was surprised at how greasy the crust was, but it may have been due to the pie ordered (Gladiator). Love the casual ambience and decor, would be willing to try another pie in hopes I would taste more of the crust and not mostly grease."}
{"text":"Really great cooking We had the Sonoma salad, veggie burger, yogurt & granola,  brownie & coffee! i know what youre thinking & its true -- we ate like gluttons -- just couldn't stop eating their wonderful food. Lots of is made right there onsite  - & what a difference! Plus -- organic ingredients. If anything could be improved that would be the selection & volume of music. It was brassy, loud pop, conducive to dancing, not to conversation or digestion. The expensive gift items - while cute - make the space pretty cluttered. Guess this is ok since they hand carry your phone orders out to your car!   All in all, I'm loving la grande orange"}
{"text":"Do you love pizza? Well if you do,then LGO is the perfect place to go. LGO has many toppings and flavors. Such as margarita, Mother earth (veggie) and spicy sausage. Really excellent. The pizzeria has fast service. It also serves homemade gelato. LGO is the perfect place to go to dinner and be with friends."}
{"text":"I waited until my second visit to write a review about LGO.  First trip I enjoyed a roast beef sandwich which was very good. Great bread, meat and veggies. All very fresh. For dessert I got the chocolate chip gelato... SO good. probably the best Gelato I have ever had in the USA.  Second trip we made it past 4pm so we could try the pizza. duh. We ordered the baked wings to start and those were fantastic. They had a lot of meat on them and the sauce was great. Then we ordered a pizza to share. When they say it's for 2 people, they aren't kidding. We ordered the Cheese pizza (boring, I know, but it's my favorite) and the sourdough crust is what really sells this pizza. It has such a great flavor and texture. The blend of cheeses were also fantastic.  For dessert at dinner we got more gelato! chocolate chip and chocolate! The choco chip was just as good as the first time and the chocolate was also very good.  PS. Order your gelato in a waffle cone! Oh man, best waffle cone I have ever had. They throw in some cinnamon into the batter and it makes such a difference!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date yesterday. If I had to rate the date, I'd give it one star but luckily, for LGO, they're not responsible for my grave mistakes, haha!   LGO has a variety of colorful pizzas that have your traditional cheese to more exotic things like avocado. I have never though about putting avocado on a pizza...I bet it's really good. What also makes LGO really cool is that they offer vegan and gluten free pizza crusts. Just be careful though, because their vegan crust is not gluten free and their gluten free crust is not vegan. They also offer an array of delicious salads.   I have the pizzeria chopped salad without cheese and I added avocado to it. The salad has lettuce, pistachios, raisins, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives. It's tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. It was pretty tasty and was the perfect portion for one person.   My date ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza on a gluten free crust. It looked and smelled delicious. Because I'm a vegetarian, I did not taste it. He said it was really good, however. I have had their pizzas before and they are indeed delicious.   The only problem with my experience is that my salad came out a good 15 minutes before his pizza. I did the polite Italian thing and waited for his pizza to come out before I ate my salad. It's a good thing because I would have finished my salad way before he finished his pizza. I should have eaten my salad, paid my bill and ditched the douche...but politeness prevailed in this case. Oh well."}
{"text":"Came here last night with the family and despite zero parking in the front, the restaurant wasn't too packed. Finding parking in the front is like trying to spot the Loch Ness monster...it ain't gonna happen. But, there is complimentary valet in tne back for LGO patrons, so that is nice. Anyways, it has been a couple of years since we have been back which is surprising because this is always a fave. The pizzas range around $13-$14 and you can easily make two meals out of it or feed two people. We ordered the half dozen chicken wings as an app, a white sangria for me and a beer for my husband. My daughter had a $3 PB&J that consisted of 4-5 tiny PB&J \"sushi\" rolls and a rather large pile of french fries for a kids meal. I would have liked more of the sandwich than fries but it was only $3 so I'll deal with it. I had the Padre (no longer on the menu) and had it modified to be with blue cheese, prosciutto, and arugula. It is a white pizza, so no tomato sauce. The crust is a little crusty and chewy...just the way I like it. My husband ordered his favorite, the Fallen Angel. Our server was really attentive and very patient with our daughter. After dinner, we walked into the grocer next door to satisfy our sweet tooth. Ooey gooey cookies were to be had (at $2.50 a pop...yikes!) and they melted in my mouth, so yummy.  Pizza, wine, and chocolate chip cookies???? Now that is what I call the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Nice new audio bits.  Mac amps JBL monitors.   Classy."}
{"text":"Their cashew cheese is incredibly tasty, even to the non vegans! I'll never let go LGO, I'll never let go...."}
{"text":"So so good, options very everyone. From the meat eaters to the plant based, everyone can live harmoniously. Suggest the Chefs Table."}
{"text":"Incredible food, friendly staff, and an uplifting, energetic vibe. After dozens of visits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I've never had a bad experience here.  The only occasional downside is the difficulty parking. If you get past that, don't let the long line or crowds scare you as they move very quickly.  If you're vegan, they have vegan cheese you can get on their pizzas that I hear is the best around. Their normal pizzas, wings, burger, commuter sandwich...seriously, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great. I always take people from out of town here! Cheap prices and even better food. I usually come here for breakfast and get the French pancakes. For lunch or dinner you can't go wrong with a sandwich or pizza. The drinks are great too. Can't go wrong with the latte with nut milk or the passion fruit iced tea. I just wish the candles they sell in the little market place were cheaper. 38$ a pop is a little rough"}
{"text":"Good gelato, good coffee, great for reading and relaxing! ! Although we didn't eat a meal, the food smelled great!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! Its a cute half grocery store half restaurant. The grocery store lets you grab and go for pre packaged meals (salads, sushi, drinks etc). The store itself is super cute! You can find so many knick-knacks plus a great wine selection. There is also a menu board to order sandwiches and personal pizzas.   Do you like dessert?! So many great treats! The \"Old Timer\" is a rich chocolate cake. Try it! Also Gelato! Go during Happy hour to get Gelato half off. Yum!  My favorite salad is the Kale & Quinoa salad and I add Chicken Salad mix on top ($3 up charge). Taste so good. Try it!   Parking can be a hassle but there are several areas (walking distance) to park or valet in the back.  I'll be a customer for life. Thanks LGO!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this outstanding restaurant (or grocery store?).  The ambiance is top notch, we felt connected yet were able to carry out our own conversation.  The dim lighting was perfect against the wood table backdrop, with plenty of light.  The waitress we had was super friendly, paid for our deserts because it was our first time (wow!), and really went out of her way to make perfect suggestions.  Honestly, our waitress was one of the reasons we had such a great time.  Amazing.  But, let's make no mistake about it - it's the food that really counts - and this was no disappointment.  Starting out we got the recommended draft beer and settled right in, ready for an appetizer.  My wife convinced me to order just ONE, and so we got the baked Chicken Wings (small - 6).  As a twist I ordered them EXTRA CRISPY.  Wow!  Please order this if you go and enjoy every drop of the delicious blue cheese dressing with those wings.  The chicken was tender/moist, the skin was crisp, it was a perfect compliment to the beer... but now we were ready for pizza.    For the main course we ordered TWO pizzas - Gladiator and Mushroom Party.  Wow.  I mean the Gladiator is a classic sausage and pepperoni pizza that fell from heaven and into our mouths.  We devoured it.  The Mushroom Party was exotic and risky (for us), with about 3 different mushrooms, some sweet onion and even fennel.  It was amazing and blew us away - very different from the Gladiator.  There were no leftovers from the two pizzas.  Our small 2.5 year old daughter helped us with the Mushroom Party pizza and had nothing but smiles on her face.  For desert we enjoyed gelato.  Two in fact!  I don't know how we found room, but they were great.  We did a Butter Pecan and Carmel.    This restaurant is one of the highlights of our Phoenix trip and we'll be back as soon as we can get out there again.  If you're in the Phoenix area - make the effort, enjoy the wait with friends/family, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this great spot! We were here for drinks and cookies (made next door). Even though this place is always busy, it doesn't take us long to check out. Everything is 5 star!!"}
{"text":"We have been fans of LaGrande for years!  It is a neighborhood staple whether you want breakfast or lunch from the counter or sit down dinner in the pizzeria.  The food is always consistently good and the service is great.  We are guilty of at least 2-4 visits a month at a minimum. Tonight we decided on carry out which is not our usual...   The order was wrong but when I called, they went above and beyond to fix it for us.  They comped our whole meal and gave a future credit as well.  Wow! Stephanie is a true professional and went above and beyond to make sure we visit again.  It is no surprise they are busy from morning till night.  Can't wait to get some dessert next time!"}
{"text":"So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)           As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.    The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.  So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We called ahead for an order of salads and pizzas for our mom's night in.  We got there a few minutes before they were supposed to be done.  The salads were amazing and the pizzas would have been too if they weren't completely cold.  We only live a mile from the restaurant and it's AZ, so you know they didn't get that cold in the drive home.  We actually had to put them back in the oven to even eat them.  Bummer.   Okay, I'm totally editing my star rating.  Though my statements above stand, I have to elevate a business who reached out to me after reading my so-so review and apologized.  As I've said in other reviews, I think it is so important for customers to be treated as real people and not just $$.  So, thank you LGO!  We'll give you another try :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich i got was better then average, ice tea was a stale batch, maybe yesterdays batch, however there were so many honeys to watch id give it 5 bees"}
{"text":"Just awesome!  Great to find a place that offers gluten free options.  Ordered the margarita pizza (GF) with mushrooms & chicken sausage.  Great quality & flavor!  Best part was the crust was thin (NY style) which is rare for a gluten free option.  Service was wonderful as well.  Would definitely return when back in AZ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here at least once a month. We finally have our order down to a science and have always had great service/food/drinks.   That being said, last night was extra awesome for us.   We sat in the lounge area because the dining room looked pretty busy and we're not picky. The bartender seemed a little new, but that never bothers us. We've both been in the service industry and are understanding. We ordered our usual, the margherita pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese (along with the tom, basil and motzz that's already on it). SO GOOD.   Our pizza was delivered with NO cheese! Which is pretty funny. The server thought I said no cheese instead of goat cheese. COMPLETELY understandable! We both laughed and we're totally fine waiting for them to remake it.   The manager, Chris, came over and offered the most sincere apology and also shared a laugh about the misunderstanding. He also took the pizza off of our bill. We didn't think this was necessary, but it was greatly appreciated. The service and hospitality were above exceptional and this is why a restaurant like LGO not only becomes popular but endures the timeframe in which most bright restaurants fizzle.   Again, we've both worked in the service industry and understand mistakes. We are loyal to a few restaurants in Phoenix because of the way those mistakes are handled. The manager Chris, our server (I didn't catch his name) and La Grande Orange in general are the epitome of great service and management.     See ya'll again soon!     ps. we finally tried the peanut butter pie and my boyfriends words were \"I've literally never had a better dessert in my entire life.\""}
{"text":"As many here have said, The Padre is the way to go. It's composed of several delicious flavors that work magically together.  This is a nice place to take friends and family."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! Chips with dip trio was great, pizzas were great, sodas in a bottle fantastic, and topped it off with homemade Gelato that was heaven in a cup! Service was great, ambiance was cool. Overall great and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend has a scary addiction to pizza and had been requesting pizza during the entire road trip. I don't trust pizza unless it is made in New York or Naples but finally we ended up at La Grande Orange Pizzeria.   Boyfriend ordered the margarita pizza and I had the avocado pizza. Both pizzas had a NY style thin crust but were missing the foldable greasy nature that I associate with pizza. My avocado pizza came with prosciutto which I'm not really a fan of. We also ordered a bottle of moscato wine which they were out of but the waitress recommended another French moscato which tasted more like a reisling.  Lastly for dessert I had the key lime pie. There was a thick layer of whipped cream which wasn't very sweet. The crust was some sort of nut crust which wasn't the classic graham cracker crust that I love.  Overall the meal was good but not special, seemed to be missing something. The service was friendly and attentive. Would probably not return."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good pizza was definetly way better this time. thanks to la grande orange for the gift card they where able to accomodate my party of 12 but had to wait about 2 hours. not good place for large groups, will come back with smaller group next time."}
{"text":"Oh my delicious. Love La Grande Orange!  We ordered several different pizzas to share and each one was delicious. The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings are fresh and beautiful, and everything is made so well. Our server, Courtney, was super helpful and all around awesome.  The white wine sangria was especially noteworthy. I usually don't like white wine sangria (I'm more of a red fan), but this was so fresh and delicious. I definitely recommend ordering a glass.  Chocolate chip gelato was really creamy and good, and the red velvet cupcake was nice with a tangy cream cheese frosting that I really liked. I cannot wait to go back and try every pizza on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference two weeks make! I visited LGO yesterday after being kindly contacted about my previous review and the unsatisfactory service I received and felt compelled to update my review.  Our server was fantastic this time around. No sign of Crabby McCrankypants...maybe they sent her to that island where the misfit toys go?  Anyway, our server was uber attentive and downright cheerful- very welcoming. I appreciated this a lot and it really changed my outlook on this place.  In addition to my usual (reliably delicious) pizza, I ordered the smoked salmon salad and it was awesome. It had dried cranberries, cous cous, corn, and sunflower seeds. I should have asked for cheese though because I'm one of \"those people\"  who doesn't love a salad unless it has cheese. I'm pretty juvenile that way.   For dessert, I had the A to Z cookie and oh em geee was it scrumptious! It had peanuts, pretzel pieces, and a plethora of other tasty add ins that made it MY NEW FAVE!  Very very pleased with LGO and looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This place has superb pizza, best pizza I've had in the valley. I tried a half gladiator, half roasted corn pizza. Both were excellent. The sausage on the gladiator pizza in particular is very good, and the roasted corn pizza just melts in your mouth.  The parking is kind of a pain at LGO, but I'll definitely be back because the pizza is great."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the environment is what I had an issue with. We went at lunchtime during the week and it was horribly crowded, they play their music SUPER loud on both the dining area and the shop area where you order your food. It's confusing to then get your order, and you have no place to stand  or wait.  If you order a salad it's in a pre-made to-go box, but made fresh. There is almost no parking so you have to drive your car around to the back to use the (free) valet. I think it's more of a pretentious place to go to say you've been there because it's in an up and coming neighborhood, but nothing about it would make me go back there over any other similar  restaurant."}
{"text":"I do not even know where to begin...this place is just all around wonderful. I went there with 4 friends and we ordered a pizza an appetizer, then each ordered burgers. Their pizza was incredible! Crispy, perfect crust, brushed with butter or olive oil and a hint of garlic, topped with fresh ingredients. The burgers we got were ok...I had the veggie burger (made with quinoa) and felt that the burger itself needed a bit more spice or flavor. The fries, however, were some of the best I have ever had. A mountain of crispy, fresh fries that were cooked in peanut oil and lightly dusted with a combination or seaonings and salt. And then...there was dessert. I got the red velvet cake and it was the BEST I have ever tasted. The cream cheese icing was decadent and light at the same time and the cake is self was unbelievably moist. I am from out of town but I will be hitting this place up the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If you love thin and crispy pizza this is the place for you. The freshest ingredients your going to get .  Expect to wait a while for your pizza, but its so worth it . I wonder how good the wings and ceviche is ? TBA"}
{"text":"Iva been here for breakfast and lunch. I love the salsa. Very good dinning area to sit back and relax in a Saturday afternoon and enjoy a salad and cheese cake."}
{"text":"Discovered in 2007.   I've been here time and time and time again. Now that I've moved to SF, I still believe this is a great place and am excited to go back for my favourite Croque Madame!! Can't wait, seriously.   Pizza isn't that memorable. I come here for the Croque and Arnold Palmer (and Liquid Sugar)."}
{"text":"This place is great. They don't take reservations but accommodated my special event by opening the tasting room just for us. The food is always great and service impeccable. Thanks LGO!!"}
{"text":"Oh my God! This is my favorite place in Phoenix or maybe in the whole entire world!!!  We ALWAYS order the  delicious wings.(seriously grilled and sauced to perfection) YOU MIST order THE WINGS! We also tried the roasted corn pizza (which is now my fav pizza ever!) the mushroom pizza and a cheese pizza and they were all delicious. There's no doubt we will back and this time with all of our other friends, It I s a little far of a drive for my family but so worth it!!! TIP make sure you save some room gelato afterwards!!   There always seems to be a wait when we go, so we browse the little shop right next door, pick out our desserts so we know what to save room for, the staff is always so nice and easy to conversations with, one of our waitress's remembered us from a previous visit and also remembered our order, thought that was awesome. I love this place!"}
{"text":"So it's my first trip here and we decided to come here as a group from work and let me tell you that it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. From the atmosphere to the pizza. They use fresh ingredients that you can really taste the quality.  This is the mushroom pizza, definitely try it!"}
{"text":"The buzz on the street is their pizza will blow your stinky socks off your feet! Well, not exactly in those words, but in that promising context!  If you know me like the back of your hand, you would already know what I look for! The crust! For one, I am a carboholic!  Whether that be bread, donuts, or rice, I cherish that food group immensely.  I firmly believe the most critical bite in a pizza is going to be your first one! It will make or break your love for it! Why? Because its the closest you will get to freshness since the time it popped out of the oven!   Bam! Love at first bite! Just the sight and smell caused some drool-age!  It had the right amount of crispness and thinness.  The bottom crust had a slight charcoal, the way one should always like it! And the middle layer still soft enough for some bending and flexibility!  Crust Test: Pass.   During my most recent visit, the amigos and I decided on the \"Gladiator.\" Yup! I guess it was indeed the most manly pizza you could get here. Glorious meat! The schreiner's sausage and pepperoni were cooked very nicely!  The cheese and sauce were no match for the meat! They played more of a subtle role but still contributed to a wonderful pizza experience.  Sauce and Toppings Test: Pass.  With all that said, I want to clearly say, this is not what I call a true Italian pizza.  As great as it was its hard for me to put it on the same level as some well-known places like Pizzeria Bianco, which will always be my numero uno.  The major difference is in the sourdough crust.  To me, this is what defined their pizza. The one trait that separates them from the Italian style is how it is NOT bubbly with that brick-oven charcoal quality.  Instead, its more simple yet quite tasty.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=Q0kUcPJhdZlueuitX154VQ  Besides everything said thus far, I want to give credit to their excellent service.  The host did a good job in booking our table and notifying my group when our time was near. Our server maintained a playful, enthusiastic attitude from the moment we sat to the time we finished our last dessert bite!   Speaking of dessert, I happily decided that their Red Velvet Cake be my new go-to! The frosting and cake was not too sweet, just to my liking!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=bCRxfhgIbOSC-eRUgD3M_g  The moral of the story, do not come here if you are seeking a true Italian experience.  Do come here, if you desire a wonderfully tasting pizza in a friendly, cool, upbeat atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Every single thing I've ordered from here has been FANTASTIC! So much flavor in each item I've tried. Whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner-LGO never fails to make a perfect meal."}
{"text":"LGO was fantastic.  Great food, great staff, and an outstanding storefront with the best English Muffins I have ever tasted.  I have dined in twice; however, and found the service to be a little on the slow side.  Also, with regard to crowding and poor parking, LGO suffers from both."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5, but I'm rounding down.  We got the Avocado Pizza, which was very solid, especially with the (recommended) addition of prosciutto.  The lemony flavors played well with the rest of the pizza, but the cheese was a little too hard for me - it seemed like there was a lot of parm in the mix.    Docking stars for the nightmare that is LGO parking, and the extreme darkness - there's a fine line between \"romantic\" lighting, and \"dark\" - my companion and I had genuine trouble making out what was on the table.  Also, I regularly stuff my face with delicious pizzas, and giving LGO the same rating as Motorino feels wrong."}
{"text":"Come for happy hour, you won't regret it!  The white sangria is so delicious :)  Service is friendly and helpful; they were more than happy to clean up the mess after I, being the klutz that I am, knocked over my water.  My bf and I shared the avocado prosciutto pizza which was amazing!  I love thin crust pizzas like that.  The rest of the menu looked really good too, like the roasted corn pizza and the mushroom pizza.  Will have to come back to try those ones!  We also had the shrimp ceviche, which was more like salsa.  Not anything like a ceviche you would get in South America, but still good!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza"}
{"text":"I actually haven't been here....yet.  My wife always brings home pizza and wings for me and I owe her dearly for it.  The thin crust pizza is excellent and rivals other thin crust producers in the Valley, namely Grimaldi's.  I thoroughly love the types of cheese that they put on their pizzas, including the goat cheese on the Roasted Corn Pizza.    As part of my last meal on this earth, I would request their delectable baked chicken wings.  I didn't know baking was such a critical component to making tasty wings, but after comparing these to all the deep friend wings I've had at bars and such, I now know better.  These wings are consistently meaty, juicy and flavorful.  You'll have to try for yourself to taste the difference, but I know you won't be disappointed.  And to top things off the Blue Cheese  dipping sauce may make you want to take a keg of it home with you.  It's that good.    My wife also brings me a chocolate chip (with salt) cookie from the adjacent grocery store-a wonderful way to end a great dinner.  I'll reserve that last star when I finally visit the restaurant.  **Tip**  Sign up for their e-club to get a birthday certificate"}
{"text":"LOVEEEEeee this place!  Delicious Food, Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"LGO is sooo good! I used to live in Midtown and miss going there for the mushroom pizza or breakfast on Sunday AM. Wine list is awesome,  plus you can go into the market and buy some. .. plus a bunch of random stuff which is awesome.  I was recently in the Sky Harbor airport and got waaay to excited to see one there!  Best burrito ever!  My only recommendation is that they open one on the West Side so I can enjoy it more!"}
{"text":"Very Harding working people that make your gastro experience very enjoyable.  Very good pie and nice gift shop while you wait for take out orders.  Didn't sit in but checked it out and looks great.  Watching the pies being made is quite entertaining and meMorizing"}
{"text":"Holy moly tastiness! Five stars for this pizza- it was absolutely delicious. I'm a big fan of anyplace that has healthier or veg options and La Grande Orange sure does deliver! I got half of the vegan pizza and half the avocado pizza and I honestly can't say which one I liked best- both were so fresh and flavorful! Also, try their wines!!! They have a great selection!"}
