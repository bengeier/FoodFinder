{"text":"Their food might look amazing, but the cleanliness seems to be a low priority for them. About a month ago, I walked pass by the store and saw a HUGE cockroach crawling on the floor. I mean, it was big. I don't normally see cockroaches this size in Canada, so I assumed this thing was probably hidden in an imported grocery box from oversea. I told one of their staff about it and suggested maybe they should check their kitchen. Again, yesterday when I found a black dead bug sitting in the bottom of my salad, I felt gross!! Worst is that I already finished this dead bug contaminated salad!! I brought it to the cashier again, and a male staff insisted it was a 'ladybug'. First of all, I have never seen a pure black ladybug, and I'm sure it was twice size of a lady bug. Second, does it look better if it was a ladybug??? I didn't know a ladybug is acceptable in salad these days?? In the end, he took down my name and phone number and that's it, didn't even offer to refund me the money. Apparently someone from their quality control team will contact me by today, I'm still waiting on that phone call..."}
{"text":"5 stars instead of 4 because I'm impressed every time I'm in here. The turkey pot pie is my favourite ready made meal when it's available."}
{"text":"I went there today because I was craving grilled cheese and noticed they opened a Warm and Toasty section(soup and grilled cheese).  

I guess this just opened, because the service is so disorganized and slow.  I ordered the 3 year old cheddar grilled cheese sandwich and waited 20 minutes for them to warn it and put it in the bag.  They had 4 people working behind the counter, the cashier, the soup guy, the grilled cheese guy, and some guy just standing there moving bags around.  They lost my bag with my name on it, and started delivering orders for people standing behind me.  Just disorganized and the wait and price and well taste of the sandwich was disappointing.  $6.77 for a half sandwich is not worth it, especially the taste, dry, cheese just slapped on and no butter or anything on it to give any sort of flavor.  

Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Never order the porchetta bundle from mealpal - completely different than what was provided on the description. It should have been an 8oz porchetta with two sides (carbs and veggies) however it just some shredded meat that taste like boiled Turkey/chicken meat with some rice and veggies at the bottom. Horrible meal experience. Never order mealpal from Pusateri again"}
{"text":"Review is based on my Mealpal experiences (so hot food) and how pretty everything looks in the store!  Definitely not your first choice for groceries if you're on a budget. But great when you need something last minute and you're willing to pay a premium to get it. 

The meals through Mealpal are fantastic. Restaurant quality, fresh ingredients, great customer service. My go tos are the porchetta, the empanadas and the brisket mac and cheese. Lunch time is busy at certain counters, so best to arrive early before noon if you're looking for lunch. Easily accessible through the PATH (in the Bay)."}
{"text":"Love coming here to see all the different varieties of  groceries specially for a person who is vegan and gluten free. 

My only concern that I have is whenever I go to the yogurt and smoothie bar there is an employee there who is extremely rude and cannot be bothered. 

I have a coconut allergy and I always have to make sure they don't put coconut water in my smoothie. Every time she serves me she rolls her eyes and acts as if it's a bother that I am ordering something. 

Other than that love this place !!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I enjoyed a delicious seafood gumbo generously full of fresh chunks of various premium seafood. It was amazing - so hearty and flavourful! 

Today, I had their \"bundle up\" combo for $12.99 where you pick 1 main and 2 sides. I chose glazed beef ribs with roasted potatoes and a spicy green bean salad (see photo). Every component was beautifully prepared and perfectly executed in every way. Herbed creamy roasted potatoes, crisp green beans and beef that was soooooooo tender and flavourful. 

What a divine meal - could have been served in a fine dining restaurant! 

Completely impressed."}
{"text":"I came here today hoping to grab breakfast, and was interested by the breakfast bar offerings. I got the small size for $6.99, which comes with a free small coffee. I always thought Pusateri was overpriced, but today was an absolute rip off!!

For the breakfast bar, I got the egg white and spinach frittata. I wasn't really feeling for the other options (pancakes, waffles, sausages and bacon, and scrambled eggs), and so asked for fresh fruit to fill up the rest. As the fresh fruit isn't self serve, I had to be assisted by the server. She was so stingy! Despite seeing that I had only one item in my box, she gave me only a few pieces of fruit. When I asked for more, she was a little discontent and made a comment along the lines of how my box wouldn't close - a totally false claim by the way, as my box ended up being half empty.

When I left, my friend commented on how little food I ended up getting. The breakfast bar is a good option provided that you're doing the self serve, in which case you can load up your box however full you'd like. On the other hand, if you're hoping for fruit, then do not come here!"}
{"text":"Had their 12.99 bundle and immediately regretted it.  First off the portion they give you cant even feed a kid.  I had their honey garlic chicken, roasted veges and fingerling potatoes.  Veges were fine but chicken was dry.  Definitely would not come back if they don't step up their portion game and/or lower the price.  All in all, not worth it.

Just saw raw salmon stored in the same place as cooked foods....wow"}
{"text":"This is a much needed solid food/grocery offering which was sorely missing in Toronto downtown. My exposure to Pusateri was mainly of their flagship store uptown. While it was great to source hard to find luxury items I personally am not a fan of the layout of that store. I guess the only did a lot of planning when adding new space but somehow I always felt overwhelmed by the number of products crammed in small place. The other offering at Yorkville was nothing to write home about but it did bring some of the dessert favorites downtown. 
This space is very good and offers a lot of indulge items in addition to the daily supplies. I will focus on the dessert offerings for now. I counted 3 retailers stalls on this visit in addition their main dessert stand. Some of the offerings from these vendors look stunning (will report back on taste in the update) I also saw a lot of prepped food (some reasonably priced). The meat counter was not too shabby. The seafood was mainly focused on high end stuff and from what I could tell about the same price point as the well known tourist trap market.
So first impression is a solid 4 star as the dessert we took home was hit.
I will update the review as I get to try their other offerings/ 
Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"I love buying food and dessert here. It's a little expensive than your usual grocery, but it's a standard price for a high end grocery. They have meat, veggies, cold meat, bread section. They even have pre-made food if you are lazy to cook. The food from the small restaurants inside Pusateri are always good. I enjoy the poke bowl and pizza.
There's a lack of space to sit during lunch time. You can basically do your entire grocery here."}
{"text":"Pusateri is a nice high-end market located underneath Saks in Toronto's Eaton Centre. They have such beautiful foods to choose from. Pass by some of the pastry/bakeries and you'll see some amazingly decorated cakes for what I think is a relatively fair price. Most of the other food items here are expensive though. The market has a large selection and it's a great place to stop by if you need to pick up a party favour or present. 

I was here one weekend afternoon for their icecream, specifically Eva's original chimney. I'm not sure if it's there anymore, which is definitely a bummer. Their icecream was delicious!"}
{"text":"Walked in to Pusateri's to find a beautiful store that I had never been to before. They had everything from groceries to pizza to coffee to water bottles - you name it they had it. After browsing around, they had lived up to their name of being a VERY expensive luxury grocery store. 

We decided to grab a sandwich and fruit for our lunch that date. The sandwich was $11.99 and was no different then a Tim's $4 BLT. We also grabbed some pre cut fruit which $7.00 later. What we found in the fruit was terrible. After we ate half the container we discovered LOT's of worms. 

Pusateris gave us our money back for the fruit but didn't care other then that. You would think a store that charges you and arm and a leg for a sandwich and fruit would care more."}
{"text":"Went to the food hall last weekend  and discovered Daits bar; imported dates stuffed with nuts and coated with different things: a healthy truffle. It was phenomenal, a great healthy alternative. Super healthy, but super delicious. If you haven't tried it you are totally missing out."}
{"text":"Service is wonderful, beautiful clean space. My breakfast bagel not so fresh. had a coffee as well to go, was hoping the bagel would be good. It looked good, the bagel itself was stale, I had the bacon egg and cheese. The baked goods looked yummy, hopefully they are, I will try them next time despite my unhappy bagel"}
{"text":"This is a grocery/Food place underneath the Bay in downtown Toronto. They have a nice mix of speciality foods, and places to grab a quick bite to eat . I stopped by here and grabbed some espresso and did some shopping. I managed to get some a gift for a friend and found other interesting things. I enjoyed stopping by here and would like to stop by again in the future. the selection was interesting and the people were nice."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how many people come here for fresh produce, but they do have a great selection of prepared foods. There's a self serve salad bar ($2.49/100g), a salad and yogurt bar where you can order freshly prepared salads, pizzeria, sandwich bar, hot food bar, and sushi bar. They also have a Greenhouse juice bar, a vegan bake shop (incredibly overpriced - $5.50 for a cupcake seems a little steep), which are operated by third party vendors. 

It's great option if you're looking for elevated food court fare, that's quick and ready to go. 

There is limited seating in the grocery store, and it gets fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon so be prepared to eat your food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Expensive - but tons of lunch, dinner and dessert options here! I made a pit stop at their grocery section to pick up some pre chopped veggies, but its also good to know that they have a vegetable \"butcher\" on site for complimentary vegetable chopping too."}
{"text":"Nice store, still at the beginning. Their service recovery strategy is completely missing. 
I like upscale stores, and I like Pusateri's. I usually shop at the location is Sherway Gardens. There are perks that come with shipping at upscale grocery stores: healthy food options, food diversity, good customer service. I would say Pusateri scores a solid 4 stars at the first two categories. You can find quite a variety of foods, the prices are quite high, but it's ok if you can afford. Customer service is a different story. Everyone seems very preoccupied by something. I tried to talk to the persons on the other side of the counter... without much luck. It seems like typing the product code in the cash register required 120% of their attention. Even when they made a mistake and I had to wait around for 10 min to fix it, I couldn't see any improvement. 
So it's 4 stars for the merchandise and decor, 2 stars for customer service. 3 stars in average."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and tasty looking prepared foods... However, I went for fresh ingredients (switching it up from Loblaws MLG.) Produce is abysmal  (considering the price - it would just be disappointing at a No Frills). My eight dollar pack of tomatoes are so old that one has mold. I wouldn't have bothered reviewing, but after spending $75, an additional $10 for fifteen minutes of parking, which I'd mistakenly assumed they'd cover, pushed me over the top."}
{"text":"5 stars for high quality choices in a convenient location. It's worthy to be recommended to tourists and locals alike. Note that I expected to be expensive, so I didn't take off stars because their yoghurt is much pricier than Costco etc since this place is not for your weekly grocery run.

As a higher-end grocery store, their hot and cold food selections are very premium - similar to restaurant quality. I picked up a samosa and it was perfectly seasoned and spicy, full of vegetables. There are also amazing cakes which are great for office parties. 

Just walk by their displays and you can often find free samples like cheese and jams. There are also lots of other shopping you can do since it's right next to Eatons and other small shops selling gold-dusted cakes and poke bowls. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Here's my two cents. Lunch has got a lot lighter on the portion side cuz poor billionaire pusateri's owners now have to pay 3 dollars an hour more to the chattel.

Highly recommend not buying asparagus as its 9 dollars. Also don't buy desserts - they're all stale."}
{"text":"A nice high-end market located underneath Saks in Toronto's Eaton Centre. This place isn't cheap but they've got lots of interesting, high end specialty products. Exploring the store they've got: smoothie bar, pizza stand, desert bakery, fruit butcher, kombucha stand, and all sorts of other prepared foods. It's a neat place with lots of selection and well above average price."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a hangover like a Caesar(made with Walter's Clamato) or a mimosa. At $5, (weekends 11AM- 3PM) you can't go wrong. Service is super friendly and the space is quite pleasant, even though you're in the basement. You can order a bite from their champagne bar menu or grab something from one of the other food stalls in Pusateri's. The steak frites and lobster roll are quite tasty. So drop by and take a break from shopping or hit this joint to get liquored up before the shopping begins."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick dinner. Service was slow and not the most friendly. I ordered a lobster roll sandwich which took about twenty minutes till it was ready. There was an option to get complementary fries or salad. I chose the salad. Now, I wasn't expecting huge portions, but for a meal that's over $20 I felt like there was something missing here. I wasn't impressed by the presentation or the flavours. And, I was still hungry after eating this. 

The quality of the ingredients were decent (definitely better than the quality at the food court) but it's not worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been sporadically getting items from here since it's conveniently right beside my office.
It's an awesome location if you want to pick up anything for office parties. Their items aren't cheap but the quality and service you receive is definitely worth the extra bucks, especially when you are in such a great location.
I once bought a cake for work and wanted them to write a message. They were out of the color I requested so their staff decided to use another color...which didn't end up good. They were very accommodating when I told them that it was for a special occasion and really need the message to stand out. They swapped a brand new cake for me so I didn't have to wait while they fix the original. I was very impressed and feel you get what you pay for here. They are a luxury food mart that charges premium prices for quality products and service, I think it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place to grab my morning caffeine fix. Their Cafe is right across from HBC's Foodwares and beside the pizza. Their prices are pretty standard but the plus for me is they don't charge me for ordering lactose free milk with my lattes/tea latte. It was funny one day when one of the newer workers asked, \"do we charge extra,\" and the barista said \"no, it's not their fault they are lactose intolerant.\" THANK YOU. I've been trying to fight Starbucks on that for ages. Anyways I totally recommend their lattes, or tea lattes. They charge one price for the tea latte (and it's for a 20 oz/large) for $3.41 taxes included! I know it's just tea and milk but it sure beats Starbucks $5-$6. Also, they give you a stamp card and it's buy 10 get 1 free. 

I've also tried the pizza from Pusateri's. It was okay, nothing too crazy special. I've had better. My 4 star review is for my latte and the service there!"}
{"text":"Food here is fresh, often made on the day of. There are a ton of choices to choose from, from dessert to italian, to indian food, to poke. You'll never run out of choices.
There's also a grocery section in the center where they carry some pretty unusual brands that you don't see at your typical grocery store.
On the other hand, things are overpriced, and portions are tiny for what you pay.

The avocado toast they make here in the morning is AMAZING, but since they moved it from the \"outside kitchen\" to inside, I've waited on average of 10 minutes with no line."}
{"text":"Service was great--no complaints there!  Last night I decided to grab some dinner since I was working late and decided on a light fare.  Noticed that the \"champagne shrimp\" looked pretty enticing.  There were a bunch of lawyers all waiting to be served and so I went over to the deli side and asked if the counter person their can assist.  He asked what I want and I told him $15 worth of the shrimps.  Three shrimps later I was full of regrets--how do you justify selling at that price???

Food is very very pricy and as much as things are laid out nicely and everything was aesthetically pleasing just not sure if this is a \"great\" grocery store--I left feeling like I was ripped off.  

This is my second shopping experience, the first was coffee and baked goods--even that was a bust.  I ordered an espresso and it was not made nor made properly--I watched as the manager trained the employee in front of me to make it properly.  He then provided me with a chocolate bake goods as a gesture of good will.

Pusateri sure trained their staff on excellent customer service but for the price they are charging... I really don't feel the quality is there."}
{"text":"I give it 3.5/5. 
Got this blueberry cake from pusateri's for a staff birthday. The cake wasn't too sweet and felt quite light."}
