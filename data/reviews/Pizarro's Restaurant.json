{"text":"Consistently good, everything I have ever eaten there was delicious.  Amazing service staff is always friendly. This is one of my favourite place to go when I'm in Ottawa."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Very good quality. Portions are on the small side though. Service is good but very slow. Dinner here is at least a two hour affair. Reservations are absolutely required as this place is popular and booked in advanced."}
{"text":"Perhaps I ordered the wrong item for this restaurant, but I was not impressed with the  margherita pizza. Very dry and over-cooked crust without the traditional fresh basil topping. My dining companion thought the sauce accompanying her manicotti was bland."}
{"text":"Pizarro is good simple italian food in ottawa. The staff is very friendly. Fried zucchinis are good and chicken parma is great.   Really Affordable...need to reserve!"}
{"text":"Very good (consistently), authentic Italian food. Good for a date or just dinner with friends. I know most will find a house salad boring, but their dressing is sooo good!   I'd recommend the chicken parm, calamari, and zucchini sticks. If you don't want anything friend there are plenty of great options (meat, veg, and pasta).  The food sometimes takes a while to come out, but the food is made fresh and comes out hot. It's worth the wait. I'd suggest ordering an appetizer.   You'll definitely leave this place full and happy!"}
