{"text":"This was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. First of all we were seated in some tucked away corner were we couldn't even see the restaurant and it seemed like we were a little neglected because of it. Our food came out and we ordered calamari, margherita pizza, Italian sausage pizza and some raviolis. The calamari was the only thing that was good and warm. I really liked the pesto sauce that they came with! But the margherita pizza was cold and lacked flavor, other pizza was cold and the raviolis were rubbery. Worst of all with this meal were my drinks. The water that they gave us when we first got there had a funny taste like the glass hadn't been washed or the ice that was in it was really old and had sat in a freezer too long. I thought that when I got my coke that maybe the flavor wouldn't be in that drink but sure enough it was in that drink too. Because of this experience I probably won't go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed.  I'm not saying that the food was not good.  It just didn't stand out.  I'm from New York and am accustomed to good pizza.  I tried the margherita pizza and it wasn't anything outstanding that I couldn't get from a New York pizzeria.  The insalata mista was pretty good.  The iced tea was interesting (kinda fruity).  Our server was the best part of the lunch experience.  Other than that, nothing special."}
{"text":"in vegas, unless you are paying $$$ for dinner, it is hard to find a place that has good service... food takes soooo long, i think they are going to china to pick up the fresh ingredients and then traveling back to cook it... service here was not as slow as other places, considering it's not too pricey..  unless you want to wait in line for those buffets, this is a place to go..  food tastes good, price is OK... you are not going to end up paying more than 50$ lets say... so i consider that OK for vegas, for the quality of food you are getting...  environment, its inside the city center.. its nice and chill... i would go there again, the next time i head to vegas...  p.s. maybe food was good cuz we were sooooo starving and hung over from the previous night.. what doesn't taste good then??"}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti and meatballs here last July, and it was so good that I've had it on my mind ever since (no joke). I recall it being hot and hearty with the perfect balance of sauce, noodle, meatball. I even made a trip to the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at LA Live back in LA, hoping the spaghetti and meatballs would be just as good (it wasn't - too oily).  So, lots to live up to on this visit to Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina. And it did, for the most part. We started with the prosciutto with mozzarella and the caprese salad. Delicious. And of course I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs for my entree. It was good - well, great - but not as good as I remembered it (I guess that's almost always how it works out, though). I wish the meatballs were a tad hotter. And there to be some more noodles, to make that perfect sauce, noodle, meatball ratio. But now I'm just being picky. To drink, the wine list had what we wanted - a bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc at just $36. We finished our dinner off with the tiramisu - different from traditional tiramisu (think less soggy, more dense and solid) - which I actually liked, so a \"win\" there.  Overall, I'd definitely go back. A great location in Crystals/Aria, delicious food, and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the all night happy hour at the bar.  Tonight- they were not busy. I spoke to the manager and asked what the overall concept and vibe of the restaurant was. He said it was a hip and trendy rustic Italian restaurant. He also said the decor didn't match the current feel because originally the restaurant was a brasserie.  I didn't get the intended vibe at all. The music was too too loud and killed any sort of enjoyable dining experience a diner could have. For a slow night, the service was slow and the bartender was not attentive. The support staff serving the food were more helpful.   I did appreciate how the managers took it upon themselves to seat guests and take orders. No task too small.  As for the food itself:  Sliders- teeny tiny and too salty Meatballs- just average Chicken wings- had a kick of heat and were crispy and delicious!  Bread- you can get it for free with your order, you just need to ask."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tasty!  Our waiter was super nice and attentive. I have food allergies and he made sure the kitchen took care of me.  He also recommended several dishes for me to pick from."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an off day, but the pizza we ordered was just mediocre. The bruschetta was AMAZING, so we had high hopes for our main course, but it fell flat. The cheese didn't taste very fresh and I honestly felt like I could have ordered from one of the stand alone shops on the strip and had a similar result. However, the service was excellent. I would give this place another chance, but I won't go running back."}
{"text":"A bit expensive, but very tasty. Had the turkey panini & veal ravioli."}
{"text":"I never thought in my wildest dream that a salad would leave such an impression on me.  The pecorino salad with lemon-herb dressing was the dish that I had to have it all to myself. It was selfishly good.  The key to bringing the crispy duck and the fresh spring mix together was the delightful citrus dressing.  It was the perfect amuse bouche!  Unfortunately the dream ended when I ate the grilled rare tuna burger.  The texture of the tuna was so rare that it felt like slimy paste...not to mention it was over-seasoned.    This place was very posh and it fits well in the high-end City Center.   I came on dead Wednesday night, so the service was quick.   Brasserie Pucks name comes with a cost, so do bring many shiny pennies.   Overall, the delicious salad is not enough incentive for me to go back, But hey!  At least I know super tasty salads exists in this world."}
{"text":"My first visit was with three girlies on a birthday outing, which started with a wander around the mall before lunch. It was an excellent kick-off to a 12-hour birhday session on the Strip. The atmosphere is nice--casual with a touch of class. The music was superb (jazzy, bluesy, just loud enough).  The sangria was the best I've had; it was a perfect blend of ingredients with just enough brandy for a good kick. We all ordered different meals and were all happy with the quality. Everything was fresh, delicious, and very well presented. They even made my salad interesting with just the right proportions of dressing, Gorgonzola, bacon and nuts. In my book, it takes a really good kitchen to make a salad that tasty. Our server was very good. She was friendly and professional without being intrusive on our fun lunch.  I'm a fan and can happily recommend this place. Get a window seat so you can people-watch. :)"}
{"text":"Worth a visit simply for the best fried calamari I've ever eaten and the Matilda draft. The 3 cheese panini with tomato soup was great as well."}
{"text":"The food was really really good. Portions are moderate. I am only giving 4 stars because the service was pretty bad. The waiter we had acted like we were a nuisance due to a larger party (6). Other than our waiter, food was good. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the waitresses see our our order, but the manageable promptly fixed the error and overall we had a very positive experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the eggplant parm and penne with Alfredo (minus the minced pork). The food was all good, and my girlfriend was particularly impressed with the aglio olio that came with the eggplant. However, we thought this place was pricey for the quality. We expected the food to be a little better especially since it's owned by a celebrity chef. We can get better tasting italitan food for the same price or cheaper (depending on where we go) at several restaurants in Chicago."}
{"text":"Really romantic setting.  The margaritta pizza was tasty.  We had the chocolate cake for dessert..  Heavenly!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and sad to say, I won't go back for it.  Their portions are tiny.  However, their sangria is superb and is $6 a glass or $16 for a pitcher, which is a great deal!  Locals get a free dessert too, with any purchase.  Had the salmon dinner on my bday and loved it.  Go for dinner, not happy hour unless just getting drinks."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, tables not too close together. Friendly professional service - except I don't like the way they try to offer you bottled water instead of just tap.  Spaghetti with meat balls were very very good. Good pizza too, big enough to share between two really.  Have eaten here before and had the octopus salad which was really fresh and tasty too."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here on 6/11/11 with my wife.  Like others have said, it's a relatively inexpensive place to eat in the Crystals, which is not exactly the cheapest place to hang out.  Plus, when I asked bartender to make me a Pimm's Cup, which he had never heard of, I just gave him the recipe and he only charged me $7 instead of marking it way up like others do for call drinks."}
{"text":"The chocolate cremoso--wow! Pistachio budino is soooo great!! Great place to end the night."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience. A Sunday morning that could not have started any better. Our server Paul was extraordinary. Wonderful service and conversion. We will return soon. We will ask definitely ask for Paul."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, and very good service.  Very nice place, and a good respite from the rest of the strip!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner. Fritto misto and a pizza. Plenty of food for two to share.  Price was very reasonable for Las Vegas. Especially for such good food. And service was spot on"}
{"text":"Tony and staff was superb. Meal was excellent! It is in city center, and a easy short walk from Aria"}
{"text":"Great Italian Food and Great Service. Came here with a group of business associates and our food was prepared just the way we like it.  Wolfgang Puck has done it again, and does not surprise me of the quality of food and service they offer. Thanks to Caitlin, our server, for the taking good care of us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have had lunch here a couple of times and EVERYTHING is good. Have tried everything from salad to paninis to pasta. The two standout dishes have been the caprese (tomatoes were ripened to perfection) and the tomato soup. The tomato soup I ordered as part of my meal (pesto panini, salad and soup) but I noticed that you can order a bowl of it (not sure if it's on the menu but it's a request they accommodated with no issues. Seems to be a popular spot for business lunches. Great lighting and overlooks lower level of Crystals were those cool water sculptures are. Very good!"}
{"text":"We came here for launch.  The service was good we've been greeted and seated right as we walked in.  The waiter was very nice all the way.   We ordered one dish of calamari and one Italian sausage pizza.  The calamari was the best I ever had!  It was slightly frayed seasoned to  perfection and at the right  temperature. It had a nice crunch   when we bite on it and it's sauce was delicious ,it was creamy and garlicky. The pizza was good, but it's sausage was useless because it has overpowered by the sauce. Therefor we couldn't taste it.  The atmosphere in general was nice until the pianist at the mall started playing. This building has a terrible acoustics and the music sounds loud and horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing food n service , the kale salad n with mushroom ravioli, yum yum all the way."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent Italian place. If you think you have had a good pizza you are in for a treat trying the pizza here. Meatball pizza is the best flavor. Also dessert was amazing we had the sorbet and the flavor was to die for."}
{"text":"Decent food. Terrible service. Made a reservation here for my fiancés birthday in hopes to experience new food and have a great time. The server seems to work alone because we saw him maybe once every 15 minutes. They forgot one of our orders and we didn't see anyone for about 15 minutes to tell them so we were all about done by the time we got it. The food is pretty good, but exaggerated. Portions on the small side. Ambiance is great, but who cares when the service is terrible. Hire more servers to take care of your guests!"}
{"text":"Ate here on the 17th aug on a Saturday evening. We were seated straight away no waiting.   I ordered one of the woodfire pizzas and my friend had some sort of seafood pasta dish. My pizza was delicious, perfectly cooked, not too much topping, base lovely and crisp. My friend also said her pasta was delicious too, full of flavour and a generous sized portion.  Our server was very attentive without being intrusive. The atmosphere is very laid back and lovely within the restaurant it's self.   Overall great food, great service. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We stayed at Aria and walked over after checking in the first day. We split the Grilled Meatballs, Asparagus Salad and Margherita & Italian Meat pizzas. The pizza was thin, crispy and delicious. They had some of the best Sangria and service was on point. It was a great casual meal to start off our trip. I only wish we got to go again before we left."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and ordered the turkey panini; we both ordered the same thing.  When the server placed it in front of us, we both literally laughed out loud.  WTF?  My three-year-old could have done a better job making a sandwich. Very skimpy. No flavor. Fifteen bucks for that?!  Give me a break.  We sent it back and neither the chef or manager seemed to care. Sad to see such a rip off happening in one of your restaurants WP."}
{"text":"Despite being in a mall, given it's upscale it provides a good atmosphere to this open restaurant. Server was attentive and the chef didn't mind customizing pizza for a food allergy."}
{"text":"Overall, a terrible service experience.  The honey and I arrived at about 9:00pm on a Wednesday night, only to be greeted by a surly and indifferent hostess who proceeded to a) give us the evil eye while b) continuing to talk to a customer on the phone.  Really?  No one could help us get seated while the restaurant was 80% empty?  After being seated, I found one of the water glasses had some lipstick stains on the rim.  Pointed it out to the bus-man, who barely even took a second look (and no apology).    Looked over our menus, then proceeded to sit at our table for another 10 minutes, hoping to catch the eye of our waitress.  She avoided eye contact.  In fact, she looked at every table but ours and our neighbor's, who had finished eating a while ago and were looking to get the check.  A frustrating experience, all in all.  The honey and I left before ordering, without even a glance from the surly hostess as we strode out the door.  I would forgive the indifferent service if this was a Chili's (or comparable chain restaurant) on a bustling weekend night, but this was neither.  A restaurant with a celebrity chef's name bills itself as a premium experience, and this was anything but.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant but with a few missteps.   Being a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, I had high expectations for this place but it mostly didn't deliver. The stars of the show are their prosciutto pizza and their garlic bread. Both were delicious and a notch above what they normally would taste like at other restaurants. Where it didn't meet my expectations, was the soppressata pizza, the caprese appetizer, and the spaghetti with meatballs. All three were average and not worth eating again.   The decor and atmosphere are nice and would definitely be a nice place for a celebration dinner. Prices are $20-$30 for most entrees except the steaks, which are $40-$50."}
{"text":"Came here because we wanted a pasta dish before the Rock and roll marathon. Shared a chinois chicken salad (which was delicious), the rigatoni, and a side of cauliflower. Everything was plated to for 2. The service was really good, and the portions were big!"}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing all day only ever sat at the bar and the service was always very good."}
{"text":"Great food. Spaghetti with meatballs yummy along with pizza  & boar ragu pasta. Happy hr at bar all day."}
{"text":"After our first long day shopping,we were starving. Wolfgang has never disappointed our family at any of his locations. The Food and service were both amazing. Fresh baked crusty bread to start,calamari, pork chops,spaghetti, and the chicken piccata were all delicious. My husband even ate brussels sprouts and enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 5 pm on a Thursday but was not crowded. We ordered a variety of dishes ranging from a $20 ravioli to a &40 steak. They were all very good."}
{"text":"I love their spaghetti. I was in LV for a computer conference at the Aria. As a lowly worker, I had a corporate budget of $50 for dinner. So I could not afford the restaurants in the hotel  and the buffet was not appetizing. I am so glad Cucina was a few steps away. I went there Tuesday night at 8 PM and was seated quickly. The place was about 2/3 full.   I had a glass of red wine, an order of spaghetti and a side of (3 large!) meatballs. Total: $35. I had to box two of the meatballs for I was full. And I even had enough money to get some nice coffee after my meal.   The spaghetti is full on flavor, with the gentle tang from tomato, a savory aftertaste and good olive oil. The place is mellow, you can actually have a conversation without shouting in the other person's ear.   It's elegant comfort from the decor to the food."}
{"text":"UNimpressed. Had lunch with a friend. The service was pretty poor, we waited a while before anyone came by to at least give us water. My friend ordered Ensalata Pizza and I got gluten-free rigatoni with pomodoro sauce. The pizza was cold in the middle (frozen crust?) but she said it was tasty. My pasta looked like they just dumped a can of tomato sauce over it (too much sauce at that), though the sauce, too, was good. The pasta, however, was way too al dente. I'd asked for Parmesan and crushed red pepper when I ordered, but didn't get it and had to wait while they went for it. I expected much better from a big-name restaurant like this. I just can't recommend Cucina, not when you can walk across the pedestrian bridge to the Cosmopolitan and enjoy great food and service at several restaurants there."}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row because it's so delicious!! Amazing food and not $$$ like every other restaurant in Vegas.  Had a $400 dinner the first night. Trying to save a bit, then came here the next night and had dinner for $60. And the food was BETTER than at the first place! Love this!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'd had gone to wolfgangs after a crazy night and my hangover would be categorized as the \"hangover from hell\" so maybe pizza wasn't the best idea.  I started my meal off with the grilled octopus \"antipasto\" it had a very fresh flavor and was very tender, executed perfectly. Unlike the octopus antipasto, the prosciutto pizza I had  wasn't anywhere near good, the combination of prosciutto, olives and parmesan had an overly salted taste and the olives made it very briny. It was really overwhelming to the taste buds so I only had one piece.  service was slow also, took about 20 mins for our drinks, we ordered beers."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizzas and sangria. The prices here are surprisingly affordable and it was a nice change eating inside Crystals than other parts of the strip. Typically we head to Gordon Ramsays at Planet Hollywood or Mona Mi Gabi at Paris.   Our party of 8 dined on a Friday night around 8pm. It was steady but not terribly busy. Everyone's food looked delicious including the calamari, chicken cacciatore and salmon. The prosciutto pizza and was amazing. Especially with sangria. Our server unfortunately never came back with our refills after we gave him the check.   One surprising thing was that a restaurant that nice had such dirty bathrooms. The design of the bathrooms is a very neat concept where the men and women converge at the hand washing sinks. However, there was trash and paper towels on the floor, wet floors in the stalls, no toilet paper and full trash bins. I felt more dirty leaving the bathroom than before entering.   All in all, the evening was a success and I would go back but would hope it was more well kept."}
{"text":"This is a cool little open-concept restaurant in the Crystals at City Center. My guest and I had the steamed mussels followed by one of the signature pizzas. The food was very good at a reasonable price. The staff was friendly as well. I found the décor the most interesting from the tv in the bar to the frosted glass panels separating the dining areas. Also be sure to check out the bathroom(s). It'll fool you the first time. I would come back here on a future trip."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas this was the first place we ate.  After the snotty hostess sat us down we waited another 20 minutes for someone to take our order and another 20 to get our food.  At that time (3:00pm) there was only one other couple eating.  The waitress never checked on us and disappeared while we were eating.   BUT the food was absolutely fabulous and fresh.   Thank god for the kitchen staff !  If you have a few extra hours and an abundance of patience I would suggest eating the food there.  It was so professionally put together.   But for the darn service!"}
{"text":"Compared to other restaurants in Vegas, this has been one of my favorites. I went for lunch, the menu did not have too many options, so if you are a picky eater you may want to look at the menu online first. Everything was great. I had the mozzarella panini with tomato soup. It also came with a simple side salad. The dressing was very light and went well with the panini. The tomato soup was on the smaller side, meant for dipping. It tasted great! The lunch was only $14 not including drinks and tip. For such a great well rounded lunch for that price, you can't really ask for much more.   It's located in Crystals and you can get a great view of the shopping mall, the beautiful artwork, and a great place for people watching. I'm a tourist myself, but its interesting to see how different the people are that come to Vegas for a good time! Check this place out, if all else fails, at least you can say you've tried Wolfgang Pucks food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Used the My Vegas $25 comp. Great service. Thank you Javier. Worth a visit. They even brought us a complementary dessert for our anniversary. Well done."}
{"text":"This is a \"must go\" spot for us when we're in Vegas. Great location in City Center mall, the butter lettuce salad is phenomenal, the tomato soup, which is not on the menu, is a must-have!  Top those off with the best lasagna we've had anywhere and I'd say we had a great meal.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to have dinner at Wolfgang Puck; unfortunately the experience disappointed. Appetisers were probably the best part but they also were inconsistent. For main course I chose Pork Milanese and it was as tough as as sole of my shoes. Service was non existent although there were plenty of servers around doing something. Twice they took all my dirty silverware but forgot to replace them. After they brought me new courses I had to ask them to bring me one and then waited for a while till my meal was getting cold. Maybe I was just unlucky that evening but I will avoid this place now"}
{"text":"Veal ravioli with wild mushrooms and sauce wonderful. Hubby says pizza was fair, he is a pizza lover with high expectations."}
{"text":"very, very bad food.  uncaring hostesses.  beef crudo so salty i couldn't eat it, waitress did not care, eventually she offered a replacement for it but only as she was walking away from the table.  soup and pizza also much too salty.  That is 3 of 4 dishes way over salted.  i have never experiences anything like this before.  veal lacked any imagination.  not what was expected of a puck restaurant.  we ate two spoonfuls of the dessert which tasted like they bought it, i don't think they did, however, if your food tastes like something you would buy in a box, as a chef, wouldn't you want to make something different - something you could make better??"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of our favorite lunch spots, not anymore!!  We had lunch here and got in right when they opened (we were the first customer). After we ordered the foods, it took a very long time for us to just wait for our food. Service was very slow and poor. Food quality is like fast food not restaurant. Took a long time to get our check as well. Overall we got bad dining experience. Not going back!!"}
{"text":"my family (18 of us) all got together for my cousins 30th...we wanted to go somewhere nice but nothing too much as there was nearly 20 of us. This wolfgang restaurant is exactly what we wanted +more.  Our server was fun, professional, and attentive.  My dad and i shared a ceaser salad, calamari, and a mushroom pizza...others around the table opted for chicken picatta, other kinds of pizzas, fish, calzones, eggplant....everyone loved their food and everyone loved their cocktails.....would go here again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Great food, great bar, and a staff that recognizes and acknowledges locals/regulars. The happy hour menu is the great secret."}
{"text":"Puck's place in the Chrystal Shoppes is a terrific find. Although only steps away from the Strip, it is a quiet, beautiful space for a really good restaurant. The restaurant is open to a large atrium the stretches above and below the seating area and people watching in the high-end  luxury retail boutiques is a fun bonus.  The food is really good. We all elected to try the seasonal Pre-Fixe menu and we were very happy with those choices. The prosciutto and burrata were generously portioned and flavorful, the fresh pasta bolognese was rich and it came with a desert."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken dinner. It was amazing! And the wine was great. They have performances while you eat and a lot of shops. I swear I saw the actor from Tron there! looked just like him!"}
{"text":"Pork scaloppine was greasy and bland, my partners \"medium\" salmon was seared outside and almost raw inside and needed to be sent back. Lack of seasoning throughout. Staff didnt seem to care all that much, wont be back.  Save your money and try someplace else.  Disappointing for a Wolfgang puck restaurant, as we like them in other  places."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicken piccata. All the flavors worked perfect together, but my only complaint would be the serving size left a little something to be desired. Fortunately I ordered the marscapone polenta which alone was a little bland, but worked well with the overall meal.  To drink I ordered the Lychee Star which was delicious non-alcoholic drink that was a mixture of a lemonade and coconut."}
{"text":"This restaurant in near the entrance to the Crystals shopping area initially has the feel of an upbeat casino sports bar. However, past the entrance and once settled, it reveal itself as a fairly excellent restaurant.  I've been here twice with the same group of friends. Once for dinner and once to simply enjoy apps and sangria and watch soccer. Both times, the service has been superb. Really above and beyond helpful and friendly. On the second visit, the waiting staff didn't rush us even though we were all done eating and drinking but still watching the game. Water glasses weren't just kept filled; the servers came around to fill my sangria glass for me.  A safe bet for food choice is either the chef's special or one of the pizzas. I've tried all the pizzas now and they are all excellent and easy to share. The sides such as the cauliflower and broccolini are surprisingly good.  There is a larger group room and an upscale wine list as well. One of the features I always like is being able to see into the kitchen. I don't know why, but that transparency makes me a little more at ease when I dine. If you can wrangle an area on the balcony section, it can also be a nice place to people watch.  The bathroom situation is a little weird but not enough to get upset about. Men and women are in the same basic room will individual marked water closets."}
{"text":"Warm decor and better food that I expected. The Caesar salad with shrimp was delicious. The pasta was okay. Fantastic service - prompt and sincere. Great beer and wine selection, too. Probably the best value for money in Crystals."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed by the flavors and food. This is typical American-style Italian food in my opinion. It's no Angelini or Mozza (for L.A. people), and reminds me more of a Maggiano's (I actually like Maggiano's better believe it or not).   We shared the mushroom pizza and an endive salad. The creamy sauce was not flavorful and tasted like it came out of a jar. The crust was nothing memorable. The salad was a typical run-of-the-mill salad.   The decor and location was nice, but everything else was definitely not memorable."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It is in the trendy Crystals shopping mall next to Aria and has very good quality food. I had the pesto lamb and it was delish! My husband had the mushroom pizza and that was also very good. They also have happy hour all day every day so you can get sangrias and other drinks for pretty cheap. We were there on a special occasion so they also hooked us up on a free dessert - some sort of tart and it was yummy! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We tried a lot of different entrees and all were great. We were here on different occasions and the food and Services were always flawless. Take away is great too, we took advantage of that as well. Great. We will come back."}
{"text":"The food was good and this is nice place for a simple lunch.  It's location at city center provides for a more quiet sit down place.  They also split the salad for us which was a nice gesture.  Both pizzas were very tasty, we had the Mushroom and the spicy pepperoni.  However the spicy was not spicy at all.  I would have provided 4 stars but our food took forever.  I think it was a kitchen screw up but the hostess should have noticed and provided a simple apology."}
{"text":"Located inside city center, we had a party of 8 and no reservations but we were seated right away. Our server steven was great and very knowledgable! My sister and I shared the prosciutto pizza and the clam linguini both were delicious!! I highly recommend them and a watermelon martini. The place itself has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This restaurant blows.  The food is mediocre and the service sucks.  Unless you're looking for bland, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's such a great restaurant. We were able to sit \"outside\", which is beautiful with the fake sky in the mall area. The servers were fast and super nice. We barely have to wait for anything. We ordered: Tomato soup --creamy and rich flavor, and service with a \"toast\", well balance. Salmon pizza (with caviar) --very delicious, smoke and regular salmon topping, well balance. But you have to drink lots of water afterward. Bolognese pasta --decent pasta. The meat is a little too salty, but the pasta is perfectly cook.   The waiter split our dishes without us asking which is very considerate."}
{"text":"My family resently moved here and wanted to check out good restaurants in our area. What an Excellent choice! The appetizers were Fantastic! Then the meal comes- i would like to congratulate the Chief! Everything was Delicious!!!!!!!!!!! The drinks, desserts, Everything! Hats off to the Chief! We will definatly go back- i told everyone i know to go to Wolfgang Puck's Cuccina Restaurant! Try it, you Will like it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top 3 dinner spots on the strip. Food quality is impeccable and seasonal varieties show they take great pride in the food being served. The pizzas are one of the best rivaling Mozza in Los Angeles. Their new heirloom tomato soup is delicious. Staff here is very well trained and always accommodating with food sensitivities. Matt at the bar is the best."}
{"text":"I thought the place was overpriced but then what isn't in Las Vegas these days. $12 cocktail? Hmmm...aren't the casino's still giving them out for free? The food was good but if you're looking for a hot dish, expect it to be a degree or two above cool. I felt like my dish was in the kitchen waiting to be picked up by the waiter for a while. Overall, it tasted fresh and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my top restaurants in Vegas.  Wolfgang Puck always has fantastic food but this one goes beyond wonderful.  The bread and spreads that come with it was an unexpected delight.  I got the French Onion soup and a salad with goat cheese.  The soup was the best French Onion I have ever had and I have tasted a ton.  I literally order it at every restaurant I go to and this one tops them all with ease.  I do not remember the name of the salad but it was incredible.  It even had onions on it (which I normally hate) but in this instance they were balanced so well I didn't even notice them at first.    My friends had the Carbonara and a burger which they were both very happy with.  Though out the meal we all kept exclaiming how amazing every thing was.  The drink menu as spectacular as well.  I have recently got into St Germain's liquor and Brassiere Puck had a few mixed drinks with it (very excited!).  The one I had was called something that involved numbers.  It was delicious! Whenever I have friends in town we always stop in here for lunch.  Also they are giving locals 20% off food for the rest of the summer!"}
{"text":"After a long day on the strip, we were looking for something not too fancy but not too casual.  We happened upon this delightful little restaurant while window shopping in the Crystal Mall.  We were able to sit right down with no reservation.    Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful when selecting what to eat.  We skipped appetizers since we weren't opting for a big meal and the bread plate is excellent!  I had the chicken piccata and my aunt had the salmon which they cooked to her liking with no complaints (she likes it well done).  The chicken piccata was very tasty and also a very large portion!  My aunt also enjoyed her salmon and said it was the best meal she had in Vegas!  We also ordered the sauteed jumbo asparagus with prosciutto breadcrumbs on the side.  Oh my, they were delicious!  Love the prosciutto breadcrumbs.  Thumbs up to this smallish and sorta casual restaurant in the heart of Vegas.   We're not too picky when it comes to wine so I can't speak to their wine list but we did enjoy what we had!"}
{"text":"where to start? The food was great, service are awesome and I had one of the best red wine sangria by far, had to restrained myself to be ordering another glass.. decor is modern, chair and table was comfortable.. They start us of with basket of bread, then we ordered the Butter Lettuce, Gorgonzola, Bacon, Hazelnuts & Egg salad, which was a wise decision to spli it. Then as main course we ordered spicy pepperoni pizza and the special of the day, is an Italian Sea Bass, Tomato-Shellfish Stew, Broccolini and yes we still took some home. Unfortunately had to skipped dessert. I enjoyed our overall dining experiece there.."}
{"text":"I'm new to Yelp and usually don't write reviews, but after having dinner at Brasserie Puck I felt compelled to change my ways.  We started out at the bar for a glass of wine and a little conversation. We weren't famliar with the wine list, and the bartender was more than helpful. After making our choices, we enjoyed just sitting at the bar and taking in the scene. The bartenders were very good at being right in front of us whenever we needed something, and out of earshot when we didn't. Uncanny!  My husband and I had dinner on a weeknight and it wasn't very busy, so we had our choice of tables. I'm sure this will change once word gets out! Being in the middle of CityCenter makes for a strange lighting situation inside the restaurant. We sat in a booth near the back in an attempt to avoid the flourescent lights. I'm sure it is fine during lunch, but it doesn't set the stage for a romantic experience. Fortunately, the food is SO good that once you bite into something, the lighting just doesn't matter anymore!  We shared an appetizer of calamari with garlic aioli, and I can easily say it's the best we've found so far in las vegas (we're locals). Calamari was perfectly crisp with a wonderful tasting batter that didn't over or underwhelm the calamari. The aioli was absolutely amazing - garlicky, with a little bit of spicy kick.   My husband had the ravioli with field mushrooms and parmesan. I can't comment much on that - but his plate was shiny clean when he was done. :)  I had the pizza with french goat cheese, and I'm still thinking about it! We lived in Europe for 3 years and fell in love with their style of woodfired pizzas. Its just something that isn't duplicated often here in the states. When I took the first bite of the goat cheese pizza, I was amazed at how so many memories of our time there came rushing back. It's funny how a simple taste and/or smell can have such a profound effect! The crust was thin and crisp, the sauce had an intriguing blend of spices, and the goat cheese was tart and creamy.   Our waiter (I'm sorry but I forgot his name), was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu (we asked A LOT of questions), and was spot-on with his wine pairings for our meal.   We plan on visiting again very soon - especially with the 25% discount for locals through April (this is food AND wine, by the way!)."}
{"text":"Had two meals here during our stay we liked it so much. Ambience is a little muted since you are in a mall, but it's a great mall and nice for people watching. Kids menu made it actually quite affordable with kids.   Pizzas were great. The mushroom Za with egg on top sounds strange but tastes good. The thin sliced cheese and cured meat apps were excellent. Service was excellent and they helped us figure out an issue we had with our show tickets while we ate, definitely above and beyond the call of duty.   Verdict-highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I made my own pizza and it was delicious. I don't eat cheese and for some reason, people have a really hard time understanding that and it always comes out with a little sprinkle of parmasean at the least. Not here! Pizza was made perfectly and was delicious. Crust was delicious and the veggies and meats were very flavorful."}
{"text":"Get a drink - I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop and Cranberry Mojito. The bartender knows what he's doing. The drinks have a delayed effect...just how I like it. Service was excellent. Ask about half orders if you don't want too much food."}
{"text":"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.  Overall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.  Sampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.  Even though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Got a chicken panini and it was great. Wife got the eggplant pizza and really liked it. With two adults and one kid lunch came to $50 including a generous tip."}
{"text":"Our waiter was never really around , My favorite was the tomato Brushetta omg amazing!! the view was very good!!! i had Clam luguinne with white wine sauce , had no flavor was kind of dry but it was OK.!! went to the one in crystals"}
{"text":"My wife and I were doing some shopping in the mall and I was in the mode for some Pizza, but they just did not pull it together for me.  The location was nice and we enjoyed our table but the service was really off.  Clearly no one was to interested in serving us as we had to struggle to get our order taken and get our drinks refilled.  Hack we even had to fight to get the bill, which they usually never have trouble getting to you.  The Pizza I got was just all right.  The crust could have been a little crisper but the toppings were good.  The one measure that I use is would I go back (those get three stars or above) but for me the answer is no so they get the two stars rating."}
{"text":"Decent food, but a long wait for a large party of 8.  Not worth the money when you can go to better environments for the same price.  2 people with drink l, appetizer, and entree was $100+."}
{"text":"It is the last night of our long weekend in Las Vegas.  We wanted Italian and came here based on the 4-Star Yelp review.  The food isn't here yet but I started the review anyway because of the lack of service. We sat around for over half an hour only to have water and place our drink and food order.  We weren't even served any bread.   I asked the Hostess about when we were seated and told her about our situation. She then got the Manager to check on us.  We couldn't convey our complaint right then because the Manager came over right at the same time as the server brought us the drinks.   The bread was brought out but I had to ask for small plates for the bread. The Manager later on brought out two small plates of cheese stuffed peppers to hold us over. At this time, Mr. Puck's pizzeria & cucina gets a negative 3 stars for the lack of service.  So when the food finally came, my friend's salad came at the same time as the entree. WTF?  Also, the server did not know who ordered what. We were at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar last night. The server knew exactly which one of us ordered what.  Then, we were not offered fresh cheese or peppers. Maybe it is just not their standard practice.   As far as the taste of the food is concerned, it is top-notch as always.  So the food gets 5 Stars but the poor service made the whole experience not so good.   When the bill came, the stuffed peppers were complementary, but there was no discount or free anything to make up for the seriously lackluster service. A major mistake.   With so many top restaurants in Las Vegas, I think this place seriously needs a service makeover."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! Tony our server was the best. He made our experience amazing. Asparagus salad was very tasty. Ordered sausage pizza. Very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in Vegas for the price.   The service is Amazing! We all came in wearing black, the waiter immediately switched our white napkins for black so we wouldn't get white linen pieces on our clothes :) They asked if anyone at the table had any allergies, seeing as we had both a nut & shellfish allergy at the table we thought that was fantastic!  The water was always filled, the manager checked in & they always showed up right when we needed them. No hovering or over-checking in.  I had gotten a $100 gift card from Bellagio for different shops in the Crystal Shops (I much prefer the outlets on the way out)......the only food/drink options were here & Starbucks....If it weren't for the gift card I probably would have never stopped here  I took 3 friends...together we got 4 different mixed drinks (cranberry margarita, moscow mule, lemon drop & a beer) everything was cold & strong.   We got the sausage appetizer, ravioli, carbonara, a margarita pizza & soup. The soup and ravioli portion was kinda small, but the raviolis were stuffed. Half of the pizza & carbonara went back to the room with us.  All the food came out quick, it was hot & everything tasted good. The pizza & carbonara were especially yummy.  4 people, 5 alcoholic drinks, 4 meals & an appetizer - $150"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Best dinner out of three I had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food and elegant atmosphere.  The waiter was very nice; if the lady at the reception could smile a little bit, then things would be all perfect. So actually I will give this a 4.9 star. Definitely worth trying when you are in Las Vegas. Actually arranging a good meal in Las Vegas i s a little bit difficult."}
{"text":"The price/quality/location combo for Wolfgang's gem in Crystals is hard to beat. For that reason alone I had to go with the full 5/5.   Our party of three was looking for some good food at a not outrageous price, and at a location that was nice but didn't require us to be dressed to the nines. If you're looking for the same, this is for you.   The table bread was, in a word, delicious. Our entreés (lamb pesto, veal scallopini, italian sea bass) were the best specimens of each that either of us ever had. In particular, the sea bass was out of this world (crispy skin, tender and flaky meat - just wow) as were the polenta and lamb.  Service was impeccable and the ambiance was nice, overlooking the lower floor of Crystals. Only oddity was the bathroom, with the common sink and M/F labelled separate toliets.   Entreés were $18-30, salads and appetizers $10-15 - incredibly reasonable for the location and quality. Make a reservation now via Yelp/OpenTable, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Ordered the bruschetta. The bread it was on was soft and fresh. The Italian sausage pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Excelent service, excelent food quality , reasonable price to be in this area, we had a 17 persons table for Christmas Eve and we spent a beautifull night, thanks to our server, try the white sangria and calamari fritto"}
{"text":"Decent Italian spot in Vegas at a fairly reasonable price. Basically a step up from Olive Garden or Carrabba's. Friendly personal service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on New Year's Eve. Before I came, I perused the online menu and was pretty set on ordering a pizza. Based on the restaurant's name, I thought that would be a good choice. When I got the menu, the veal tagliolini, a New Year's Eve special, caught my eye as did the $32 price tag but it was New Year's Eve so I went for it. It was plentiful and DELICIOUS! The veal was super tender and the tomato sauce drizzled with pesto was oh so tasty.   Boyfriend ordered and liked the turf (ribeye) and surf (prawns), which was $45. I tried the prawns and thought it was okay. I didn't try the ribeye, but the steak was big, at least 16 ounces. The turf and surf came with roasted potatoes and it was yummy. The potatoes were well seasoned, the skin was perfectly crisped and the inside was cooked perfectly.   We also shared a caesar salad ($14) which was very good and could have been split 4 ways there was so much. What I liked best was they used romaine spears and fresh shredded parmesan. The dressing was also top notch.  To pair with our food, we ordered a pear drink and a bellini. I preferred the pear drink. There was also complimentary bread and butter. The bread was warm and the butter was creamy. Very nice. Finally, our waiter was attentive but not bothersome.   The bill after tip came out to be $146. Our bill was high because we splurged, but this place is actually very affordable. Most entrees are $16-25.   It was a good experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"One of the best lunches I've ever had, along with the best calamari and mussels. And the best tomatoes & mozzarella in my Caprese salad. Cute little place inside Crystals at CityCenter, with a nice bar area and cool bathrooms! The staff and service was excellent! Our waiter was funny and really took good care of us, we even got a big round table with no reservations. Highly recommend for lunch as the prices are not bad at all compared to most restaurants in Vegas.   I have a full review loaded with pics that will make your mouth water here: http://littobites.blogspot.com/2012/01/vegas-lunch-wolfgang-puck-pizzeria.html"}
{"text":"We just had 3 different types of plates to share between us. Pizza was delicious, steak was amazing, burger was very nice. Nice environment and good service. Well done!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Really enjoyed the prosciutto appetizer. The salad and salmon special was delicious. Tony was an awesome server and was super chill. An added bonus was I checked in and I got 20% off my tab. Would definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"this is inside the Crystals Center and although they are all high end stores, I still feel like dinning inside a mall.   Menu is pretty simple with mostly pasta and pizza. I guess I have a higher expectation because of the Wolfgang Puck name. I was hoping to see some creative pizza and pasta combination.   The lasagna was good, it was light, meaty and delicate without a heavy tomato sauce. It was worth $19.  The sweet corn pizza was a bit disappointing. The dough tasted like frozen pizza dough and there were not enough seasoning to bring the flavors out. I enjoyed a frozen pizza more from Trader Joe's.   Plus, our waiter was very pushy trying to get us to order more food. I mean...this is Vegas, doesn't everyone have 5 small meals a day?"}
{"text":"Craving for Italian food while shopping I ended up at Cucina. It is a well maintained restaurant in a busy shopping area. Having gone for lunch on a weekday post lunch time the service was slow and delayed. The water and cold drink were not refilled at reguar intervals. The wait time for taking orders and food service was late.   The garlic bread was freshly baked. It had a delicate garlic profile with crisp bread edges which were not too hard to chew. The tomato basil pasta however was sloppily served. I was shocked when they prepared it with canned tomatoes. The only basil flavour was from the huge basil leaves placed on the pasta. The texture of pasta was soft. It was clearly overcooked.  Being a sweet lover I ordered the Tiramisu. This was also a disaster. The cookies were soggy and the tiramisu tasted pre prepared.   I am a huge fam of Wolfgang Puck. But Cucina does not live upto the name. It is more like a fast food joint than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Everyone in my party really enjoyed their food. We're vegetarian and the waiter suggested the spaghetti without meatballs which two people got. I appreciated the fact that they only charged us $15 for it, when the menu price is $21, because we got it without the meat. Most places won't adjust price like that.   Service was friendly overall."}
{"text":"Service is terrible!! So slow and the waiter never checked on us at all. The server also took away our bread before we were even done eating it!  Some of us ordered soup with our entree, and some just the entree. Their soups were brought out when our entrees were brought out. So when we finished our entrees, they didn't even GET THEIRS yet. It was pretty ridiculous!!!!   The rigatoni and the lasagna sauces are REALLY salty. Almost unbearable to eat. I couldn't finish my dish because it was so salty. The clams and linguine does not taste like anything but butter.   Overall, a VERY disappointing meal. Best thing was the bread"}
{"text":"we had a nice time. food was good and service was very good. we had several of the bar menu items which were just ok but not great (palenta, rice balls, porc belly and mahroom arugala salad). they lacked seasoning and were all just ok. the pizza on the other end was great great great. perfectly cooked, crispy, think with great toppings. we had 3 of them as well so lots of left overs for the next day (one was with carmelized onions, one with italian sausage and another with asparagus and mascapone)  we were very disappointed with the manager treatment which we felt not very classy for such location. we had purchased a voucher at the tix4less location (discounted shows and restaurants on the strip). the voucher was suppose to be for 20% off on all food items. unfortunately, when the bill arrived it turned out the bar menu are not a food item as they were not included in the discount. when we pointed it out to the waiter he said we should speak to the manager and he just brushed us off saying he will speak to tix4 less (surly its not the first time he heard of this issue as it clearly satted in the voucher all food items). this was clearly a misrepresentation by the restaurant as they are clearly being dishonest about it which is not at all something you can associate with wolfgangpuck!  all in all, the bar food was just ok but can easily skip this food item all together as it was not very tasty and apparently it is not a food item at all as per management.  the pizza's were all amazing in this location as well as others we had tried in previous times on the strip as well. pizza is the best bet  4 beers later and a bill of $100.....the voucher deal and the bar menu left us with bad taste but the pizza rocked"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite when we arrived to the Aria and on our way to explore Vegas.  Instead of a pizza, we ended up with the mushroom-barley soap, Gorgonzola salad, and an amazing pork shank.  To top it off, the pear \"perfect\" martini.   What a great little find.    The wait staff was solid too.    True to Vegas, there was interesting people watching too.     This is a must."}
{"text":"Quetzi was amazing! She was attentive and so friendly. Made our dining experience that much better. Thanks for the suggestion on the lemon sorbet!"}
{"text":"This was our third time here, and, again, we loved it!  The food is fresh, mostly organic, and prepared with care.  The main course (eggplant parm) was outstanding, and the appetizers (shrimp scampi and meatballs), and the side veggies (broccolini and polenta) were excellent. O my lordy, the polenta is out of this world.  Seriously.  Even if you're not a polenta fan, you want this. Trust me.  We got the budino trio for desert, and I love the addition of the pistachio flavor....  Excellent wine list, excellent, speedy, friendly service-- when you eat here, you will love it!"}
{"text":"my friend and i went for a late night dinner here after a show.   when our food came out, her fish that she had was so hard that when she tried to cut a piece off to eat, it flew into her lap! i think i got the gluten-free pasta ragu, which wasn't very impressive. i barely remember the meal!   My friend ended up sending her fish back, but it took so long for it to come back out that i was finishing mine. at this point we were both so tired and she wasn't hungry anymore that we just sent it back in. Mind you, it wasn't like I had scarfed down my food. I was leisurely eating, trying to wait for her food to come out... and we were talking the whole time.  definitely not a place I'm too willing to go back to."}
{"text":"We wanted something quick but tasting like home, Cucina did the trick. Tony was our fabulous waiter and gave us the las vegas welcome. Margherita pizza and caprese salad were delicious. He even went as far as re-heating my pizza after it got cold. The wine was flowing and so was the dessert. A no brainer! Thank you Tony!"}
{"text":"Two of us came here for lunch and we ordered prime beef cappacio, linguine with clams in white wine garlic oil base, and cheese panini with tomato soup. Everything was great, I never seen places using huge clams to make linguine as they did, and the service was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Vegas ain't cheap. It can be really difficult to have a solid meal for under $50 a person. I looked at the menu for Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina and couldn't pass up the possibility of a good meal at very reasonable price.   Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria is hidden within Crystals at City Center so we really wouldn't have found it if we didn't research restaurants in preparation for our trip. When planning our list of dining options, I discovered a fabulous secret: all day happy hour. Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria offers all day happy hour at the bar which includes amazing deals on small plates and drinks. As there were only two of us, we walked right in and sat at the bar.   We proceeded to order an insane amount of food including calamari, an insalata mista, gnocchi, and the lamb chorizo pizza. The calamari was crispy and delicious, one of the best I have had. It was served with a garlic aioli which made a fabulous dip. We received our salad shortly after finishing our calamari and were pleased but not wowed. It was a pretty basic salad with cherry tomatoes and parmesan but it was very well dressed. After finishing the salad we were happy to see a huge plate of gnocchi and a very large pizza, perfect for sharing. The gnocchi was one of the best I have had, served with a flavorful sausage bolognese, and the portion size was HUGE! The pizza was certainly upstaged by the gnocchi but still very good. The chorizo was tasty and I really loved the crust.   We received our bill and were thrilled to see that it came to somewhere around $75-$80, a steal in Vegas! The food was excellent and I would definitely recommend it to someone wanting a delicious, casual meal in Vegas. Why four stars? Our waiter who was actually a bartender, was pretentious an inattentive. We did not receive any of the delicious bread people rave about and we barely saw him the entire time we were there! He was chatting and laughing with another party seated on the other side of the bar. That night I was very thankful for food runners because if there were none, we would've never eaten. This didn't seem to be an issue with every waiter/bartender, just ours so don't let this stop you from going."}
{"text":"Cucina is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and has some of the best Italian food around. I just came back from a trip to Italy and the pasta and pizza is as good if not better. I always come for lunch as it is pretty casual and sit at the bar for the amazing happy hour deals. The ingredients are simple but all fresh and homemade, which is the base to any great food, no? I have been to all of the other Wolfgang Puck restaurants in Vegas except for Spago because I go to the one in LA, but Cucina is definitely the best! I recommend the margarita pizza and spaghetti, as I said both simple yet divine!"}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza was really good. It had a nice buttery olive oil flavor. Great crust. The bruschetta was also good. Service was friendly and the bus boy worked really hard. Reasonable prices for Vegas and a nice spot in the mall."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Our female server was accommodating and the paninis were yummy. We also had the tomato soup which was a great accompaniment to the paninis. Their ginger iced tea is a fun twist on a tasteful tea. We prefer their lunch to their dinner but still decent dinner menu:)  Pros: Lunch, Service, Food  Cons: not a great spot for dinner"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for my birthday.  The food was amazing and our server Tony made our evening very special. Thank you Tony!"}
{"text":"Yummy restaurant in the middle of the very expensive and very prestigious shopping mall. Random spot for such a tasty place, but it was worth it.   My friend and I shared the Caesar salad and then we each had the same pasta dish and for the life of me I cannot remember what it was called but I was happy.  Perfect last meal in Vegas"}
{"text":"I give the food 3.5 stars, but the setting and service helps round it up to a 4-star experience. I had the all-meat pizza and the portions were generous. The meat and peppers were tasty, but I have had better pizza. My friend had the clam linguine and enjoyed it. Overall, it's a nice place for any occasion."}
{"text":"We were so glad to come by this place on our trip to Vegas! The salmon is out of this world delicious. Crispy and and flaky AND tender and flavorful. What more could you ask for? We were on a keto / ketogenic diet and still were able to eat here - which is great.   Service was also great. Make reservations! We saw people get denied."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for my birthday so decided to try a Wolfgang Puck experience. So disappointed, the service was bad from start to finish. We sat three feet from the bar and still couldn't get a drink until my husband walked up to the bar himself. Our food and desert took so long to be served my husband had to ask manager. They have a special menu that we did order from which was a deal so I'm not sure if our service was based on us ordering from that menu because we did notice party at table close to us was getting great service. I am hoping it's not because we were a table of hispanics and they weren't... anyhoo food was salty and service bad and when we complained they offered 20% off bill which I just noticed is offered to everyone on this yelp site. Needless to say we will NEVER be dining there again."}
{"text":"Very modern setting in the Crystals shopping mall in City Center.  Did not try the pizza but the eggplant parm was excellent.  The starter of Calamari was perfectly cooked and very tender, served with Ailoi instead of the usual red sauce, a nice change."}
{"text":"The food was amazing however the service was the best ever. Ask to sit in Tony's section, trust me. You will not be disappointed. The experience will make your day!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this restaurant. We had just arrived in Las Vegas and we were starving with no dinner reservations. We hopped the train from Bellagio to Crystals at City Center and within minutes we were seated at a booth overlooking the cavernous Crystals bottom floor. What a treat! While we dined, we were treated to a quasi-flash mob of dancers as well as various duos of dancers performing modern and classical dances. Without a doubt, these are the most coveted seats in the restaurant!  There was no pretense at all at this \"celebrity\" outpost of the famed Wolfgang Puck. It was casual and comfortable, and the service was attentive but not overly so. We started with the calamari fritti which was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. My husband had the Veal Scallopini. It arrived as an abundant plateful of succulent and tender veal 6covered in mushrooms and artichokes. My hubby, who has a huge appetite, was \"complaining\" he was full about half-way through his plate.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of Capellini Pasta. It, too, was a generous portion of delicious eggplant which was not overly breaded or greasy.  (I consider myself an eggplant parm connoisseur and order it whenever I see it on the menu.)  This one did not disappoint! Like my better half, I could barely get through half and was bummed that I had no place to heat it or store it back at the hotel to devour later.  What impressed me most, after the food and unexpected entertainment, was the modest bill. With all we ordered as well as a glass of wine and a martini, we didn't even hit $100, a feat I wish we could duplicate at other LV restaurants named for a famous chef!"}
{"text":"The food and the drink was absolutely amazing! The staff was super friendly. We were not disappointed. Highly recommend for a casual dinner or romantic couples night out."}
{"text":"Located along the Las Vegas stripe, this open restaurant overlooks the center of the Crystals shopping mall.    The service:   The wait staff was very nice and were very attentive.   The food:   I had their vegetarian option of a mozzarella pesto panini sandwich, creamy tomato soup, and mixed green salad. Everything was very good. I really enjoyed the crusty bread that added to the crispiness of the sandwich, but I especially loved the tomato soup. It was thick and creamy and you can taste the tomato flavor without the acidity. I love idea of  how it was served in a cup: brilliant.   Overall:   This place is an excellent place to enjoy a filling lunch with quality ingredients. I'd comeback in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This was the best and cheapest meal we had in Vegas on this trip.  The food was excellent. There where three of us and we shared an excellent pizza for an appetizer.  I had the Wild Boar Ragu. IT WAS TERRIFIC. Service was great, dessert was good and the casual atmosphere was most relaxing. This place is recommended for an alternative treat and great value when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a somewhat fancier meal in Vegas, without breaking the bank. Its hard to find in this city, but this restaurant seemed to fit the bill.  We started with the calamari, which was probably the best calamari I have ever had. The pieces of squid were in nice large chunks, and the batter was a golden brown, perfectly deep fried. The garlic aioli accompanying the calamari was delicious but there wasn't enough.  Three of us ordered pizzas while the fourth person ordered gnocchi. The gnocchi was soft and chewy, and was tossed in a thick red sauce. The pizzas were not as delicious as the calamari, which I had thought was going to be a prelude to an awesome meal. The dough was very thin throughout the pie; probably the thinnest pizza I have ever eaten. I had the yukon gold potato pizza, but the potatoes were sliced so thin that I couldn't even taste them. (Upon eating the leftovers the next day, the potatoes even seemed undercooked as they tasted a bit raw). The dough also had a very floury taste to it.  The service was quick and friendly. Our water glasses were kept filled all throughout our meal.  Overall, the pizzas were meh, but the rest of the food was good, and prices are reasonable. I would come back, I just wouldn't order a pizza."}
{"text":"Here I had the best calamari ever in my life - Fritto Masto , crunchy and soft. I had Frutti Di Mare pasta and Tuscan potato both good."}
{"text":"Always love Cucina and all the PUCK restaurants in vegas! Great happy hour prices and selection. Delicious as always!"}
{"text":"We thought based on the reviews that this place would live up to the Puck name. Not even close. Slow service and below average food. The chicken tasted like hospital food and my wife should know as she is a RN. The pizza was decent and for the location and service, I would find an alternative."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner on a Tuesday night.  Would recommend this as a good spot for a upscale casual dinner with very good food and nice ambiance.    Restaurant features a \"patio\" of sorts overlooking Crystals mall which makes for good people-watching during your meal.  Booths are comfortable, although the degree you sink into them is kind of strange and kind of feels like eating on a couch...  Portions were huge and good was good.  I had the veal scallopini and my friend had the chicken picata.  Would order both again.  Other friends have eaten here for brunch and also recommended it.  Price point is reasonable given location in Crystals/CityCenter and, additionally, locals receive 20% off or dessert through the end of September.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered Cesar salad and broccolini. The Cesar salad was a bit disappointing; the lettuce was limp and a bit old and the dressing was watery and lacked flavor. The croutons were blah. With so few ingredients it should be easy to assemble a quality dish.  The brochillini was passable.   The Wolfgang white wine was lovely.   The service was slow but friendly."}
{"text":"Good and friendly service from all the staff.  There's table and bar seating available with relaxed atmosphere.  This was our first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and we only had room for a pizza due to a late lunch so we'll return to try other menu items in the future.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and service was great! Request Tony if you want to have the best time ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty much can't go wrong at Wolfgangs restaurants. The food was great, actually excellent but the service was terrible. Sucks when a bad server can ruin a meal. Didn't ask if we wanted drinks, just brought the food. Not good."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This was fancy dining at its most enjoyable. Our party all had the specials of the night and every bite was perfection. I strongly recommend Cucina for a bit classier treat. Our waiter, Tony, was simply the best. He made recommendations and treated us like family. But the family you like and invite to your house for dinner."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Cappuccino was fantastic.  White sangria delicious and refreshing. The chicken picante was outstanding and margarita pizza perfect."}
{"text":"My salad was fantastic! My husband's sandwich and fries were amazing too! Great service! Great food for a reasonable (for Vegas anyways) price!!!"}
{"text":"Yawn. Nice atmosphere, cool location. Not crowded. Came with my family. Food wasn't bad, not amazing either. All four of our dishes needed salt. Our waiter was good. Tiramisu was average. For the price I was hoping it would be a little better."}
{"text":"This evening we enjoyed a delicious meal at Cucina.  The caprese salad had freshly made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  When ordering a wood fired grilled pizza, we requested meat free & our server offered red onions which complemented the olives & other toppings perfectly.  Apollo, our server, provided impeccable service.  My sweet grandson needed a pizza prepared for his food allergies.  The Cucina staff exceeded our expectations.  He loved his dinner!  Thank you to Apollo and all the staff at Cucina."}
{"text":"Great food in Crystals for a good price.  Great service.  We had lunch there and split a salad and pizza.  The passion-fruit drink was great and husband loved his strong beer."}
{"text":"For some reason this place is empty a lot of the time. If you're looking for a convenient bite to eat by Aria, Cucina will more often than not have tables available. The bolognaise pappardelle was the highlight. Sea bass was quite good as well. A more of a lighter dish. The torchio was very hearty. More heavy flavors if you're feeling it."}
{"text":"The pizza and service here are way way better than in the Aria's pizza joint.  As with every Wolfgang Puck place I've been to, the service and wine selection were also of a high quality.  This place is a nice, quiet respite just feet from the hustle and bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"I am shocked by anyone who said negative things about this venue.  We were absolutely pleased.  The food is fresh, great flavors and very wonderfully priced!  We enjoyed a special for one of our party Anne it was beyond amazing!   Another party of ours enjoyed the prefix 3 course!!! They serve generous portions and the food is quality!  We too had Tony the server and he was beyond helpful in all questions!  In fact we have not seen a waitstaff so happy and honestly wanting to make you feel at home.  The view is all open concept so it is very nice to enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner & not impressed. Service was incredibly slow & the food was mediocre, at best! Save your money & go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Good for lunch. The linguine with manila clams were good. However, the grilled chicken panini was just ok. Nothing great."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, as well as beautifully plated. Our server was so nice, and closed a dividing curtain to give the group of 7 of us a private dining experience at no extra charge. I would definitely recommend! From the food to the ambience to the great service."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing exceptional about it, but everything tasted fresh, and is a good spot for a quick meal. Would not go here for dinner or consider it fine dining."}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my coworkers since it was one of my boss's favorite restaurants. It's located in the Crystal shopping center next to Aria.  We started off with some appetizers: The Salumi & Cheese board, Bruschetta and Fritto Misto (calamari). The cheese board had a nice variety although I didn't like that the olives were not pitted. The calamari was cooked perfectly and had a great garlic aioli to accompany it.  Since we dined there on a Thursday, it was Gnocchi night and I decided to go with their daily special, the Veal Gnocchi. I was tempted to try their Ribeye which was the other daily special but decided on something lighter. The veal was cooked perfectly and flavorful but I wasn't so much a fan of their Gnocchi. My coworkers who ordered the ribeye said that it was very good.   Overall, the food and service were great, would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow and they didn't seem particularly busy. The manager was very apologetic and offered free dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"Great experience, awesome pizza, superb service, location easy to find and get to."}
{"text":"Enjoyed delicious wild mushroom pizza with hen egg and pappardelle pasta with meat sauce and ricotta. The service was great as well. Caesar salad was kinda run of the mill unfortunately, high quality lettuce but dressing was nothing special."}
{"text":"came here on the last night of our trip and everything was delicious. We had 6 people in our party and we were all celebrating our anniversaries. So they were nice enough to ask for everyone's name and print out a Happy anniversary sheet with our names on it. (Thought that was a nice way of making us feel special). since it it was Sunday they also do a family style dinner. All in all everything was great and we all enjoyed our meal. Def a place to go!"}
{"text":"Great Food!!! Location, Location, Location.....inside the NEW City Center, it's HOT, overlooking everything from up top. Real sexy.  I had Chicken Parmesan....wifey had the Eggplant Parmesan. Some of the best Parmesan's that we've ever had. Everyone one else at the table had different pizzas and no one was disappointed. The pizzas are HUGE, but no one was taking any extra food to go....we all had to do some gambling, watch the Viva Elvis Cirque Ole at Aria, and a club to DJ at later that night.  We loved the food, the ambiance, and the overall experience. Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Awesome service and the best prices in Vegas!! Apollo was the best waiter."}
{"text":"What a clean restaurant with great service and great food. The Caesar salad was deliciously simple and presented well. Not overly dressed.  The soprasetta pizza was scrumptious too. A delicious sauce. Every bite was tasty. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Perfect $$ place in a luxury mall with a chill ambiance. Good for bar drinks (mixologists here are top notch), or dinner and drinks. Seats 2-6 people tables comfortably I think, so keep that in mind if in a large group. Overall, a surprising find in Vegas with great food and drinks at reasonable prices and decent portion sizes!   For apps, the speck salami was great! It was presented well and they provided a generous ish portion with ~6 slices, olives and 2 pieces of toasted bread.   I tried the burrata filled ravioli. It was earthy, creamy and zesty. Delicious. And vegetarian.   The fettuccine carbonara was creamy without being heavy/oily, and was perfectly balanced with bits of pancetta and zucchini.   The pork Milanese was the star. The meat was tender and moist and paired perfectly with the freshly squeezed lemon juice and mustard sauce (on the side). And since it's fried, the salad cut through the fat nicely. I loved this dish!   As far as drinks go, just get them ok? They are artisanal, special and well crafted. Plus their ice is clear, which I always like. I would rather go here than those other fancy bars like chandelier!   Expect to pay $25-30 without drinks."}
{"text":"Great chicken piccata. Pizza was a bit of a let down, but still pretty good. Great service as well."}
{"text":"After numerous Vegas trips passing by this restaurant I finally stopped in for a bite to eat - and I definitely do not regret it. Wolfgang's pizzas were fantastic. Thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings. I could go as far to say that it might turn into one of my top favorite places to dine at on the strip. The atmosphere was casual, the services was friendly and quick, and the food left me craving for more.   I tried:  | Spicy Pepperoni, Calabrian chili, and Fresh Ricotta Pizza  | Marghertia, Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomatoes, Basil Pizza.    I drank:  | Mint Basil Ice Team - So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Service and food was very good. The restaurant closed at 10pm and we stayed till 10:20. The server never made us feel rushed and was really kind. Our pasta had just enough cheese and sauce to make it as delicious and tasty as we like it. I would say, the only downside is that they don't give you complimentary bread.. who does that? Sorry, I just love my bread  but overall, excellent chill Italian restaurant right on the strip and extremely affordable! Did I say affordable! As well, if you don't finish your fancy drink, the server will offer you to bring it to go!!!"}
{"text":"Great staff! Very nice kept checking in, but wasn't a bother. I was never low on water!! The food was good and the servers seemed to know everything about the menu! Very helpful! Also hours are great and not too pricy when you order correctly!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual place to grab a quick bite before a show, the staff here can have you in and out fully satisfied, within 30 minutes.   The bruschetta with its tasty topping of pesto and finely chopped tomatoes was fantastic. The flat bread pizza was light and crunchy, and the sautéed garlic spinach was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"As one that eat in almost every resturant on the strip. The Cuchina has a spaicel launch menu 3 meals for 25 $ I needed to try that out. The minestrone soup was ok not more then that. Then I had the mushroom ravioli ....i don't know why the chef put peas in this meal because I don't find match between peas and mushroom. Espacily if the mushroom outside the pasta and not inside. Inside the ravioli was chees..they say on the menu it's parmesan but it was really sour...so, I'm not sure a bout that. Atleast I got termisu cake was OK LIKE regular diner bit more then that. Everything was 25 $..but after 2 hours I will be hungry again.. one more very important thing. It was taking forever to the food to come out. So it makes all the experience even worse. You will do your thinking. For me, I'm not coming here again."}
{"text":"way TOO SALTY ..we were very excited to try out this place. we ordered prochiutto di parma, seafood linguini, and carbonara. but everything was salty and Carbonara was just way way too salty that it was inedible and the server took it off our check. but the servicewas good."}
{"text":"Love the pappardelle pasta!!!! All the favors were simply flavorful. This is what we had: -Pappardelle pasta -child's pizza -Bread!!!! So good!!! -Rigatoni pasta -Carbanero  pasta -Broccoli rabe -Cauliflower -Market vegetable The service is amazing and everybody is so nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here to have a drink prior to figuring out where we wanted to eat dinner. After having a drink and great conversation with the staff we decided to have dinner as well.   We started off with the charcuterie board which was solid. Bread, meat and cheeses were fresh and plentiful. For entrees My wife ordered the bolognese and I ordered the torchio (a carbonara dish). Prior to ordering our server told us he would put their pasta dishes up against any in Vegas and after trying them I would, too. Our dishes were opposite from each other so we had a broad spectrum of their pasta dishes. Both were phenomenal. It would be hard for me to order something else the next time I am here.  Two last notes: First, when heading to the restroom area, you are able to see into the entire kitchen and I really mean the entire kitchen, floor to ceiling, delivery area to grills. It was impeccably clean which is not too common anymore. Second, all of the staff was amazing. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was taking care of us that night while we sat at the bar, and in fact, they probably all did. We enjoyed the entire night there and would to go back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband was craving for thin crust pizza so we came here.  I was excited to taste the linguine and clams, but they were all out.  I was bummed.  I had another type of seafood pasta; I forgot the name.  It had calamari, shrimp, and clams in an angel hair pasta.  It was okay and had a kick to the sauce.  I wasn't too impressed with the service."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and amazing service.   We ordered from the 3 course meal for $35 and also individual dishes. The Chicken Parmesan and prosciutto were probably the highlights of the night. It was cooked perfectly and the breading was crispy. The Pappardelle was also good! The pasta's texture was  really on point. We ordered the NY steak (medium well) from the 3 course meal (with extra charge). There was a good crust on it was still tender inside. Finally the sea bass was good, but it still had a somewhat fishy smell to it, which I personally do not like but it was bearable.   Adding on! The waitstaff was exceptionally accommodating and courteous! I scrapped my foot from my heels and asked if they had a bandaid and the waiter, Apolo, brought me more than enough bandaids to patch up my scrapes. He was extremely attentive and made our dining experience very memorable. We couldn't have asked for a more helpful person to wait our table.  However, service is a bit too slow for my liking. I arrived at 7:20 and am still here at 9:20 waiting for my dessert to arrive and it is not packed here.   Other than that, I would recommend this place to anyone! I made a reservation a hour before and when I arrived I was seated immediately. If you're someone who likes to take your time and enjoy your drink while eating a great meal, this will definitely not be a problem.  Note: the restaurant is located in the Crystal next to Aria. From what I know, there is a self parking in Aria."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience with server Tony! We had a bachelorette party and he took amazing care of us! Huge shoutout to him he had excellent food knowledge and he was super fun and energetic. The food and drinks were amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Sea bass, spaghetti and ravioli were all amazing. We came here for lunch for two days straight."}
{"text":"The food here will not disappoint but it is on the pricier side just like anything on the strip. Portions on the salad and pasta are quite small. We had the beet salad with goat cheese (so fresh!!) and the tomato ravioli pasta. Service is very good too and it's a great excuse to check out Aria. I'd come back to try more of their food next time since we were in a rush and didn't get to fully enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"Great meal especially considering the cost and location.  Staff was great.  Went over the menu and specials and answered all our questions.  They had a great 1/2 off wine special when we were there.  Charcuterie board was very good (especially for the price compared to other restaurants on the strip)  The Ravioli was incredible and I could eat the Sopressata Pizza every day.  Loved it and will return often."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer: I am a Bay Area foodie which could explain my extreme disappointment of yesterday's lunch.   The most underwhelming food experience I've had in Vegas... ever!  It was a late Saturday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't full. There seemed to be plenty of support staff and chefs and cooks in the kitchen. With so many people, I was expecting prompt service but I was so wrong.   Paid $11 for the most basic Moscow mule I've ever had. My friend and I could determine the lack of ginger taste is because they didn't use ginger beer - more like ginger ale. The salami plate was probably the shimmering highlight of the meal but it came 20 minutes after we were given our drinks. How long does it take to slice up some salami and put it on a cutting board? My friend ordered an extremely basic balsamic dressed insalata. We both agreed that we could make better attempts at home.   For our mains, we both got the cacio e pepe. Which we delivered another 20 minutes after the antipasti. We were both expecting a buttery and cheesy masterpiece. It was not. It needed more seasoning and was not hot and steaming as I would like for it to be.   I'm sad that Yelp reviews didn't away me to love this place.  I'll be looking towards other Italian places next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tony with a T kicked ass!  Food was great, but service made the night.  I'd come back anytime.  Especially liked the Cauliflower."}
{"text":"I frequent a lot of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants both in Los Angeles and in Las Vegas. However, I have never been so disappointed in the service at a restaurant before. I came here over a year ago and I am still so mad about the service that I finally decided to Yelp about it.   My friends and I wanted to watch the Patriots Texans game but most of the restaurants in the City Center area were packed. So, we decided to eat here. There were 8 of us (5 girls and 3 guys) and the restaurant seated us at a table with no access to televisions. So, we asked to be moved. They had a high table that sat five with a view of the TV and some seats at the bar, so the boys and the girls split up. We asked that the high table next to ours be held for the boys when it  became available so that at some point in the meal, we could all be sitting together.  We ordered and soon the people at the table next to us left, so we went to tell the boys to come over. However, before we were able to do so, the red-haired lady who we were dealing with sat another group at the table. We pointed out that we had saved this for our friends, and she just said it was too late now because she sat other people there. Our master plan had been foiled, but we gave up at this point and decided to continue dining separately.  At one point in the meal, our waiter overheard my girlfriends and I discussing how we were disappointed and we would have probably eaten elsewhere had we known we would have had to sit separately anyway. He asked if everything was okay, and we told him that he had been great, but the others at the restaurant were not. The red-haired hostess/manager came over to us and said \"I heard you are talking badly about me. Do you have a problem with me?\" My friends and I were shocked. We didn't realize we were in high school again, dealing with this type of gossip and confrontation. We told her that yes, we were disappointed in her service. She did not do anything to make it up to us, and had a major attitude with us for the rest of the meal.   Totally disappointed in my experience here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our meal at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina. The restaurant is located in the heart of Crystals, City Center's high-end shopping district, but trust me, this isn't \"mall food\" fare. This is quality, tasty food severed in a casually elegant, modern yet warm and inviting environment.  My husband and I noticed that both chicken parmesan and chicken piccata were on the menu, along with veal scallopini. We both love veal, so we asked if they'd be willing to make veal parm and veal piccata instead - the chef accommodated and our meals were excellent!  Our waiter was pretty good and gave great cocktail/beer suggestions as well. I had a seasonal pumpkin martini that was YUMMY! A bit sweet for dinner but I didn't mind in the least.   Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"WP. Always Rocks.    Loooove his Restaurants.   Went there few Times. Always Perfect Food. Nice stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Had to stop here since the walking around back and forth on the damn skywalk ways from hell tired me out. The baby artichokes and olive tanapade was very good but I wish it would have been a hot dish (perhaps not meant to be). The eggplant Parmesan was good and crunchy (thank you Panko breading) but not quite moist, fine either way. The side pasta was good also, not sure if it was cooked in butter or olive oil, perhaps some other sauce, it was comforting enough. Finally, I am usually biased for big portions and I was scared when I saw the dish sizes but surprisingly, it quite filling and just right! Vegas strip prices, ok service (I had to ask for the bread, how dare they!)"}
{"text":"MY husband is a vegetarian and we found when we arrived in Vegas that it is difficult to find good vegetarian options. W.P.'s was perfect! Husband ordered the goat cheese pizza without the meat. The onion with the cheese was just delicious. I ordered the creamy pasta with prosciutto on it (forgot the name). At the end, we ordered the donuts, which were perfectly cooked and to-die-for. Excellent service as well. All around perfect dinner."}
{"text":"We ate the Salmon Dish/Italian Sausage Pizza/Beat Salad and Tuscany White bean soup..Best Pizza U ever tasted. Salmon was fresh and soup full of flavor. Without  thinking twice I would come back again tonight and duplicate our order."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Their speciality cocktails are some of the best I have ever had in my life. The atmosphere is nice and quiet away from the loud casino scene and no smokers. The food is pricey, but the quality and taste of the food is amazing. The service was great as well. Very courteous and patient."}
{"text":"This meL was the first time we had every person in our party finish all their dinners and desserts....Apolo, our server, was fantastic and gave excellent recommendations for entrees and desserts and kept our drinks full. We will definitely be back again. Papardelle pasta was perfect not gamey at all for wild boar Grilked Pork Steak was marinated and grilled to perfection. If you like korean bbq pork or pork adobo you'll def like this. Polenta was super smooth creamy... def not like other polenta served at your typical restuarant ea bass was flakey yet had a crispy skin that wasnt oily Ravioli was perfect cheesy goodness  Kids pizza was perfect to share with  toddler and everyone at the table  Apple dessert, zeppole and kids sundae were perfect as a closer to our meals"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Excellent food and service All The Time! The spaghetti and meatballs are the best ever.  Reasonable prices and great atmosphere. My favorite restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 enjoyed the pre fixe  dinner option for $35.  It proved to be an excellent value including a starter, main course and dessert. The salmon cooked a perfect medium.   Although the portions were a bit smaller,  we were satisfied and didn't feel stuffed. Service prevented a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"After shopping around at the Aria Hotel, our stomachs were rumbling and we were in dire need of food. Since Wolfgang Puck had a reputable and popular name, we felt safe coming here to eat.  We arrived just as they opened and HH was all day long! Ordering some beers, caprese salad, bruschetta, and pizza, we were stuffed and still had money in our wallet.  The decor is nice located right in the middle of the mall with beautiful wood chairs and tables.  It was a nice find for a famished family, leaving satisfied and not ripped off."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese with pesto was amazing. One of the best I've tasted. My friend and I had the same dish. We asked to substitute fries for the salad and they brought us fries and salad but no soup (which the dish comes with) but they quickly rectified the situation and brought us the soup. Really delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner on Christmas and we certainly weren't disappointed. We had the antipasti board, minestrone soup, veal scallopini, and several pasta dishes which were all nothing short of delicious! Service was also impeccable - our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. Needless to say, we'll definitely be back for more one day."}
{"text":"Tony made our night! Thanks so much for your great service and honest recommendations. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Appetizer was really good we did the $25 set lunch combo comes with the appetizer main course and a choice of dessert I ordered the panini and it was too salty for me didn't like that much the spaghetti Pomo diro was good.The Tomato bruschetta and Shrimp Scampi appetizer was really good!!!! Also The place small easy to find the people here are really nice kudos to Anthony and Juan really did a great job taking care of us! We also had cappuccino and tiramisu and vanilla zeppole w/ caramel sauce! Now that one is really good while it's warm the tiramisu not much! Will be back to try other entree here!"}
{"text":"Great experience here! Went for a friend's birthday & had the best dinner. Appetizers were very tasty. Had the antipasto salad & bruschetta for starters. The pappardelle with wild boar was excellent. Our server, Tony, was not only attentive but very down to earth & made us feel very at home. The drinks were also very good; the Old Fashioned is a must! Best one I've ever had! Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sitting at the perfect perspective to see out into the crystals shop, Cucina by Wolfgang Puck provides both a wonderful view and wondrous food. I was here for a young professionals mixer. As soon as we got to the restaurant, pizza, bruschetta, mozarella balls and many  of their appetizers and hors doeuvres were presented to us immediately.  The waiters circulated the little balcony area so quickly and efficiently. It seemed as if food was coming out in all sorts of directions. It was definitely the speed they needed for an after work function.  Noticing the decor, the restaurant was vibrant in colors but also warm and comfortable. There was a sitting area, a bar and of course a little area for the cocktail tables.  We got our drinks which was brought to us immediately. The bartenders were friendly and receptive to questions. Just when we thought they had stopped serving food, they brought out another selection of appetizers. Off to the side was also a cheese-board and cold meats charcuterie.   Cucina provided a magnificent location with outstanding food service, professional and friendly staff and the perfect vibe. I would recommend this restaurant for your future event!"}
{"text":"excellent food and the waiter was outstanding. was my wife's birthday July 4th and he had a great dessert with a sparkler candle in it  recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Nice little place, food was amazing, drinks were great and the service was the best. Definitely coming back here when I visit Vegas.   Ps our waiter Tony was amazing!"}
{"text":"My first Wolfgang Puck Restaurant! After seeing this guy's name all over TV/ nearly all the hotels in Vegas, I HAD to try something amazing.  After a CRAZY long day of walking in 100+ degree weather all the way down the strip trying to save taxi money, we figured SCREW IT, WE DESERVE A DAMN GOOD MEAL. Okay, in all honesty, it was probably only me that didn't want to take the taxi but after that day I realized that public transportation is definitely worth it.   ANYWAYS, I ordered the ravioli with porcini mushrooms, brown butter, sage/pepper sopresatta sweet peppers! The name sounded fancy so I decided to give it a try! It was a little pricey but it's probably the cheapest of all the WP restaurants around. The ravioli were delicious, I preferred them over the cheese ones that my friend ordered. We also had a few pizzas at our table, and all these dishes were definitely big enough to be shared by two (at lunch) !! Servers were great, my only complaints are that the sun was pretty much blinding me during half of the meal, and the cute but tiny fizzy drink that I ordered was definitely not worth the 6+ dollars that I probably paid for it.  Definitely a great lunch spot! :)"}
{"text":"What I ate: -Fresh Bread Rolls (topped with carmelized onions) - Free -Garganelli Carbonara w/English Peas, Egg Yolk, and Pancetta ($17.00)  Both of the above dishes were delicious and filling. Pre-gaming for an upcoming night out of drinking, the carbs defiinitely cam ein handy.   The bread was light, tasty, and hot. The Carbonara was sauced perfectly, the pasta was fresh, and the portion was made just right.   Although dinner took a bit long to make, the waiting service was freidnly and quick to refill drinks/bread.   Bottom line: I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Since it's not as fine dining as the other Wolfgang joints in Vegas, I thought it was still a decent place to go to. We tried the octopus appetizer, prosciutto pizza, and ravioli dish.   I thought the octopus was eh...kinda lacked a punch. Maybe could use some more acid. It's not a winning dish.  The pizza was not bad. Consider the price too I thought it was pretty doable. The crust wasn't too dried up and the proscuitto was pretty good. The tomato sauce helped since I tried my friend's pizza that didn't have it and I thought the tomato sauce gave it that extra punch to the pizza. It really helped.  My favorite and winning dish was that ravioli. The sauce was very good and the inside was tasty. Prob could eat that all day. It came with like 8? ravioli but yea I recommend this dish.   Service was pretty nice too but they weren't busy at all so that added to it I guess. haha"}
{"text":"Was craving some Italian and was in the area so checked this place out. It was an interesting open concept built into the mall. Tried out the 3 for $25 lunch and was not disappointed! Great cheese and meat plate, some of the best chicken Parmesan I've ever had and delicious doughnuts!  That was definitely a nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great as restraunts is modern and has a nice open environment.  Food was good, nothing extremely special though in the food department as I felt it was normal. My husband and I both got the pizza and although it was good it was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I'm Italian. La pizza è buona. Gli spaghetti al pomodoro sono da evitare, talmente piccanti da non sentire il gusto. Il caffè espresso non è male. Il servizio al tavolo ottimo anche se fanno troppe domande mentre si mangia. L'ambiente è ok considerando che si trova dentro ad un centro commerciale."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously last night with a girlfriend. Place was pretty dead for a Friday night. Sat immediately. Server was nice, ordered the citrus mint iced tea....wish i hadn't. We both started off with a caeser salad, it was truly fantastic. I got the spicy pepperoni pizza, my friend got the veal ravioli. She had one bite and was disgusted although she didn't return it or make a fuss they took it away and didn't offer to replace with anything, we figured they would just take it off the check. They didn't. Barely saw our server. The busser mostly did everything for us. All in all, place was nice a little expensive, but chances are I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"My friend and I kicked off Restaurant Week with a bang, or a Puck.  Cucina is one of the many restaurants in Vegas by Wolfgang Puck.  They offered a wonderful menu and provided a lovely meal. Service was very attentive as my water glass did not go empty.  Our mother's brought us up right and taught us to share.  We were able to enjoy many of the dishes with leftovers.  We started with the Summer Panzanella Salad.  This salad is so light and refreshing.  It embodied fresh tomatoes, cucumber, greens and croutons.  It's definitely a great starter salad that won't ruin the rest of the meal.     Next up is the Sweet Corn Ravioli, Chicken Piccata & Meat Pizza.  I was won over by this twist on ravioli.  I loved the sweet flavor with the creamy burrata.  The Chicken Piccata matched the excellence of the ravioli.  The chicken gave way to the light sauce and fresh asparagus.  The Italian Meat Pizza was loaded with pepperoni, coppa, red onion & olives.  It was good but I would stick to the pasta and entree options.   Our dessert choices included Tiramisu and Chocolate Budino.  I loved the budino. The chocolate cake pieces on chocolate pudding with cherry pieces & whipped cream created a masterpiece dessert.  And really how can you go wrong with Tiramisu? It's wonderfully made here to cap off a fulfilling meal.   So if you're hungry in the Crystal Shops, Cucina is a great option."}
{"text":"One of the beat restaurant experiences in vegas! Apollo was our serve. It was the best service we had ever had. We were celebrating a bachelorette party and we felt like queens! I definitely recommend coming here! The restaurant was open and it was very intimate! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the ravioli! I had to squish the cheese into 1/4 of the ravioli to have a full bite of cheese. The wine the waiter recommended was bad. He was just trying to up sell! Ugh. I think the only thing that was worth the price here was the Margherita pizza. Other than that there have got to be better places to eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Our lunch here this week was SO good. The Italian sausage pizza with smoked mozzarella and peppers was amazing-- so many flavors in each bite. I didn't think the crust was anything to write home about, but the toppings really blew my mind.  The butter lettuce salad was also solid. Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"upscale mall restaurant with very professional staff and service.  Had the hickory burger with a side of fries fried w/ sea salt and rosemary, awesome hearty combo.  Thanks Kara for the great experience."}
{"text":"Very fancy and great location/service, but food left much to be desired.  This is a see and be seen place not a foodies paradise."}
{"text":"Very elegant place! Good food and great service. Great getaway lunch place after loud casinos and shops"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible pizza. Soggy, and tomatoes on Margerita look and taste like canned. Salad serving ($15) is big enough for about 3 bites."}
{"text":"Food was great, experience was ruined by poor service. Would have been great if the waiter would have checked on us after taking our order. Another drink or some more water would have been great. Looked like he was having a great time with the other staff though."}
{"text":"Just ok. If you like pre-breaded frozen wings and sangria made with cheap dollar store wine. On the upside the waiter was great."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I grabbed dinner here and it was one of the worst dining experiences we have endured.  We ordered drinks and the meatballs immediately and waited 20 minutes for my wine and another 30 for the horrible - worse than frozen - meatballs.  They brought us drinks we didn't order, and a simple margarita pizza took over an hour.  Our server avoided us so she didn't have to explain everything.    The pizza finally came and was the best thing we had.  It took well over an hour.    There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to put up with bad service and so so food. Wolfgang should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"First off,   I own a restaurant.  My large group of friends and I dropped with no warning on this restaurant, and they exceeded every expectation.  the service was quick, attentive, and superbly friendly.  The food was ordered family style, 7 pizzas, 2 salads, 4 entrees, and 4 appetizers.  It came out in amazing time, was well executed in presentation and timing, and honestly the best meal I have had in at least a year.  Calamari was very good. The grilled octopus salad was perfectly cooked and just the right texture, the salmon was sushi grade and cooked just as we ordered it, rare. Most other restaurants overcook fish, but they seared a 1/4 inch thick layer of carmelization, and the rest was perfectly uncooked. I complimented the manager and staff on the way out, and they deserved it- our experience should have been botched, but was handled by true professionals."}
{"text":"we have dinner at Cucina by Wolfgang Puck. Started with the mussel special with spicy tomato sauce with a bit of white wine for appetizer (wish I got a picture!), prosciutto pizza (pepporoni, salami, red onions, and oregeno), and Pappardelle (wild boar raguat ++ pecorino). Then ending with Vanilla Zeppole which is basically fresh fried donuts with white chocolate and raspberry cream! All so good! Definitely recommended!!! I honestly can't go to another Italian place based on flavor, fresh dough and the best pasta I've ever had. #cucinaitaliana #wolfgangpuck #freshpasta #foodporn #foodie #lasvegas #inlovewithfood #anniversary #yum"}
{"text":"It will cost you about $80 (including a decent tip) for two entrees, one app of bruschetta and one Stella draft.  The food was good, but nothing over the top.  The service was good, but our waitress was in a rush to do her job.  I wouldn't recommend Wolfgang Puck unless you just wanna sit at the bar and have a wood fired pizza with a beer."}
{"text":"I remember back in the 80's when Wolfgang Puck's name meant something. Even after Spago. Eating st Granita in Malibu was a big thing for me. And when he opened CUT steakhouse I felt like it was ok but just very well marketed. Food was not as good as people said it was. And now we're here at possibly the worst pasta I've had in all of my life. I'm embarrassed to even say it. I love food. So it has to be bad for me not to finish it. But if it's good I will praise it to next levels. Some people forget I've had food channels and even CNN do features on me about spots to eat at and I wish I could show them the bad places too. I ordered the prefix lunch and the prosciutto was not fresh or tasty. Ok. Fine. Next course. Chicken parmesan which was not so bad. Maybe a 7 Out Of 10. But then I ate the spaghetti and it was a 1 Out of 10 legit. Cmon. This is a restaurant with Wolfgang's name on it??? I should have just walked further and ate at Carbone. They never disappoint. But overall the food was terrible. And it's Italian food which is embarrassing to Wolfgang's name. I will not only never eat here again. I will make sure nobody I know or who follows me on my actual larger social media pages knows to avoid this place. The service was pretty d decent. My actual waiter did a great job. But the food was bad. I also think Crystals should be embarrassed to have such a poor tasting restaurant inside their premier mall."}
{"text":"It was awesome. We eat vegetarian pizza and pasta; so  delicious. French fries was so crispy and low oil.   Staff were so polite and smiling. Our food was customized.( we choose every thing that we want) also gelato was so delicious."}
{"text":"20% off with a Yelp check in is what drew me to this place!  I made a reservation for 3 at 7:30pm on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded at all. My group was greeted by a server who's name I think was Sean? I forget but he was attentive and gave some great recommendations. My friend and I split the rigatoni and the Italian meat pizza.  The rigatoni was great and tomatoey! Loved the flavor and it came out piping hot, nearly burned my tongue! The pasta still had a nice bite to it and how it was made perfectly captured the sauce.  The Italian meat pizza lived up to it's name. Lot's of delicious meats my favorite one was the coppa. The crust was nice and crispy and served as a great vessel to dip in the extra rigatoni sauce I had leftover.  The food was great the service was nice and the 20% made this experience that much sweeter. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Always visit here when we come to Vegas every few mos. Service is always on point and food is always quick and truly outstanding. Never disappoints. Visited Lupo at Mandalay Bay ( another Wolfgang Puck production) and was disappointed by both the service and food."}
{"text":"We needed a place to go to before the LOVE show at the Mirage and this place really delivered!  From the appetizers to the wine to the perfectly prepared tiramisu (perfect consistency)... Will definitely come back. And Bryce was one of the best servers I've had so far. (Bruce like the canyon, y'all!) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Four Stars?!!!  You gotta be kidding me.  I'd ask if al the people giving this place amazing ratings are drunk, but its Vegas so clearly they are.  The pizza here is boring as hell.  Toppings are typical of pretty much any pizza place in any major city, and the crust is totally soggy in the middle of the pizza, but scorched on the outside.  Totally unimpressed.  At $18 for my pizza i could have gotten one just as good from Dominoes for 8 bucks.  I also got the Ricotta fritters with red pepper jelly to start.  They were not very good.  The Jelly was not spicy at all, but instead incredibly sweet paired with the extremely sour lemon ricotta fritters, my palette was totally shot after eating just one of them.  Why would a well known chef put his name on this crap?  Give me some interesting pizza not the same old fair I get everywhere else!"}
{"text":"A wedding rehearsal dinner group had an amazing time here! Wow- I really loved it! A lot- anyone having a wedding at the Aria or a nearby hotel should DEFINITELY consider having a reception here! So we had a room in the restaurant that I wish I would have photographed so that others on here could see. It was super nice, elegant but not stuffy. It was perfect for the dinner. We had around 3 dozen, but my guess is you could probably add another dozen or two.   The food was awesome. A few appetizers and pizzas were selected for the tables and were all very good. The pizzas were particularly excellent!! I would definitely come back here just for the pizza. Most everyone enjoyed there meals or loved their meals that came afterward. The only ding I would give them is that the drinks were a bit on the very weak side; however they tasted fantastically!  The bride mentioned how easy it was for her to work with the staff to make this event happen, and they decided to go with WPP&C on a last minute change of plans and they worked with them seamlessly.   I will definitely head back here next time I am in Vegas, which is often, and will tell friends!!"}
{"text":"The basilico was delicious (a cocktail made with vodka, limoncello, lemon juice and a basil leaf). I paired the basilico with a grilled octopus salad: delightful. Of the nine kids who were with us (ages 7 to 15), everyone who tried the octopus loved it. For the entree I had the roasted duck ravioli, a $28 chef's special that wasn't quite as amazing as it sounds. The other star of the night was their cauliflower with capers and chili. Finally, portion sizes are neither sparse nor overflowing; salad, cauliflower and ravioli all together didn't have me loosening me belt."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! No crowds. Slightly difficult to find in City Center, but worth the hunt. Once you get there, you should try the caprese salad, the veal ravioli, and the  with penne with red sauce. The lasagna is unique! Prices are more like a $$$."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Open Table. Didn't even need one on a Sunday night. Place was dead and although very nice, service was very slow. Also had a slight misunderstanding about their family Sunday dinner. Please note that the wine offered in the package is NOT included in their package, we found that out as soon as our bill came.   Food was good but not great. It's priced about right for the name but I wouldn't eat there again. Ravioli was cold-we sent it back and the plate and serving size was a lot smaller than our original plate."}
{"text":"We were really hungry and thought the menu looked pretty good... We were seated in the corner on the other side of the restaurant... it was a little secluded...  It's located inside Crystals facing Aria Hotel... We started with the calamari... the sauce was amazing!  the calamari was nice and crispy, and tender.  I ordered chicken piccata, which I thought was excellent... husband ordered the eggplant parmesan which had a nice texture and crunch but a little on the bland side... We also got free onion and sourdough bread.    Overall, the service and food were both good... it was also a decent price...so we'd return if were in the area..."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. I'm in town this week for a conference and I went here with a friend who is local, we did the $40 three-course restaurant week menu.  You usually can't go wrong with Wolfgang Puck, so after looking at the menus online, I chose this place. I had seen it before on previous trips but had never dined there.  Busboy service was impeccable - my water glass was rarely empty, and the one time it was empty for a few minutes, the busboy came over and actually apologized which was over and above. Wait staff was friendly as well.  I ordered the tomato caprese appetizer, the grilled pork for my main, and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was fantastic although the tiramisu had more of a cheesecake-type quality; it could've used a little bit more coffee flavor and this is coming from someone who doesn't drink coffee.  My friend had a different appetizers, ravioli, and the pistachio pudding for dessert. She loved the pudding but said that you had to really like pistachio in order to like it.  Glad to know that there are other great Wolfgang Puck restaurants on the Strip, I've only been to Spago and maybe one other. Spago is one of my favorite Vegas restaurants but I'm adding Cucina to that list now too."}
{"text":"To be candid, I was fully prepared to not enjoy this meal. Celebrity chefs typically have more flash than substance. That being said, I would be more than happy to eat my words...if I wasn't so pleasantly stuffed on a great spicy pepperoni pizza! The spaghetti and meatballs were just as delicious. All of the wonderful food was made even more exceptional by Jeremy, the bartender, who took excellent care of us through the meal. Well done!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Solid place for a quick meal. Like hearty the ministrone soup. The burrata and prosciutto appetizer is rich but a bit too much burrata in proportion.   Skip the tricolor salad - a bit too strong in vinegrette and cheese is a bit too salty.   Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good slightly-more-upscale-than-casual Italian place. The food was simple but rich. I had the \"really good amaretto sour\" and it was delicious. Also had the caprese which had an amazing cheese. The pappardelle bolognese was so so good. It wasn't too packed for Friday night either. It's next to a bunch of shops so I imagine it'd be great for lunch after a morning of shopping."}
{"text":"Had a nice table behind the host station. It was a 50% off wine night and we tried two bottles that were a good deal. The food was mediocre at best. Not what I have come to expect from a Wolfgang restaurant. The service was poor. We had to seek out our server several times to get basic things. The food runner tried to step in to help but had no training on serving. To leave the restaurant we had to find the server and then wait for the bill then go and find the server again to pay the bill and had to wait for our paid receipt."}
{"text":"I forgot that I have been to this place with my wife three years ago. Anyway, the food is still great and worth another visit after three years. We ordered Antipasti Salad and it was a wonderful surprise. And the Linguine was something a seafood pasta lover should never miss. The wines are also reasonably priced. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza and pasta was delicious. I especially love the white peach sangria. I will come back to eat there. I recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I wish I had found this place earlier in my trip - I spent far too much time and money in mediocre restaurants along the strip. The Crystals @ Aria is a stunning addition to the strip with its striking architectural design and minimalist interior plus it has NATURAL LIGHT.   This WP is a casual open air bistro with fantastic food, great service, and decent prices. I sat at the bar and loved everything that the bartender/server Carlos recommended. It was also the happy hour with drink and appetizer specials. I had the grilled pork belly (delicious and crispy), asparagus & prosciutto salad (amazing and I wish I could eat this every day), and fried fritti with spinach dip (tasty fluffy dough balls).   Honestly, I probably could have eaten here everyday and been content. I highly recommend checking out Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria & Cucina."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with no wait on a Sunday night. Their pizza and pasta were both amazing! Our waitress Bryce was absolutely amazing! Put up with tons of our questions about the menu and was overall very nice and super attentive :)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the pizza. I love thin crust, but the pizza here was like cardboard."}
{"text":"Good food and good selection of wines. Attractive pricing given the premium nature of most sit down restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"On the plus side of Cucina: Very reasonable prices for a famous chef's Las Vegas restaurant located in a swanky mall. The pre fix, 3 course dinner option is a particularly good value.  Professional and friendly wait staff. Quiet location away from noisy,smelly casinos. Good food, mostly. Our entrees were very good. My husband had pizza and I chose eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant was crispy and flavorful, although the tomato sauce was a bit bland. The tiramisu dessert was packed with flavor. There were a couple negatives in our one dining experience here. On the negative side: the salad (ensalada misto) was so over-dressed I could not eat it. I love balsamic vinegar, but not that much! I couldn't find our waiter to complain, but I did mention it to the second waiter bringing bread and filling water glasses, as she took away my mostly filled salad plate. She either didn't mention my \"inedible\" comment to our waiter, or no one cared.   To go along with my tiramisu dessert, I ordered decaf coffee. The first cup was excellent. I commented to my husband that it was the best decaf I ever tasted. I eagerly accepted the offer of a refill. The waiter took away my cup, and 3-5 minutes later, came back with a full cup that was frothy and tasted like instant. Yuck.  The first cup was either caffeinated or was brewed decaf.  Either way, I was sorry that the second cup left yucky taste in my mouth after a mostly very good meal."}
{"text":"This is a quite and hidden place with amazing food and great service. We loved the sangria and the bruschetta was to die for! Totally loved the ambience and it's right next to the Aria Hotel."}
{"text":"We expected better food. It tasted like California Pizza Kitchen. Not impressed !"}
{"text":"Kinda of a sleeper hit.  Although really pretty in very elegant crystals, it doesnt have the over the top, loud decor /presence you expect from a very branded wolfgang puck in over the top vegas.  It actually has some class, lol. Pricing very reasonable and portions good.  All the food was very good, not one item that couldve been prepared better: -Calamari- wow that pesto sauce -Butterleaf salad w hazelnuts -Antipasto Salad -Veal Raviloi- decadent -Chicken Picatta, and panini so good and very nicely presented -Pizza- perfect crust -In the running for best tiramisu ever"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with the wife. Small restaurant so we were happy they weren't too busy and took us quick.  The menu is pretty lackluster. Nothing gourmet about the selection. This place is more suited for lunch time or quick bites.  I had a 3 meat pizza, my wife had eggplant parmesan.   The pizza was ok, took the waiters advice and subbed one meat for sausage. Great call... but I'd have loved some, any, cheese. It lacked the sweet flavor that cheese gives which makes pizza so enjoyable.   My wife said her dish was good. I don't care for eggplant so I passed testing it.  Dessert, my wife got gelati and I got zeppolas. Gelati is always good, the zeppolas had no flavor.  The best saving grace here is the staff. They are fast, friendly, and very efficient. Bravo!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing on multiple fronts. A distinguished restaurant in a stylish location. Excellent Italian food. Perfect service. I can't remember having a better server in my whole life, I am serious, Paul killed it! He is a very friendly person. We had a really nice discussion about wine and beer - he is quite knowledgeable about the latter. He brought multiple samples so we could easily decide on what we liked best. During our lunch he was always there to tend our needs and make sure nothing was missing.  The food was excellent. I went with the bruschetta as the appetizer and I loved them. The tomatoes were fresh, properly prepared (seeds removed) and very well seasoned. The dish featured a freshly made basil pesto that lifted the dish to a whole different level.   Paul told us that their pizza was baked in a wood fire oven, so the decision for the main dish was pretty simple for me. A very appealing thing was that their oven has a window on the restaurant side and you can see how your pizza is being baked - a really nice touch! I went for the Prosciutto pizza and I do not regret it. The taste was astonishing. All the ingredients were fresh and and you could really taste the smokiness of the wood.  Everything was fine tuned for a perfect experience. When I'm back in Vegas this is a spot I will definitely revisit. Thank you for the wonderful experience! I had the time of my life."}
{"text":"Honestly we had the best service here. Tony was one of the best waiters we have ever had. The food was very good and had a great atmosphere. I had the caprese salad and and their pizza.  It was so amazing and the flavor was perfectly balanced. The customer service is still astounding. Everyone was so nice and I will ask for tony from now on. A well earned tip."}
{"text":"We came here for Italian style pizza but they unfortunately ran out for lunch. Instead, we ordered one meal off their fixed price menu with rigatoni, caeser salad, and tiramisu and another entree of spaghetti. The salad and rigatoni were very good according to my husband and my spaghetti was decent. Although I prefer my red sangria stronger, I loved the small cuts of apple in it.  The tiramisu was light, fluffy and not too sweet - so it was a great dessert. Overall, the service was fantastic and I didn't mind eating in the open mall - it was strangely relaxing but formal."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Cucino! The servers are very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Fritto Misto (calamari), spaghetti, rigatoni, garlic bread, and the meatballs. The calamari was beyond tender and the aioli dipping sauce paired with it perfectly. Spaghetti and rigatoni were both fantastic and full of flavor, they were also large portions. Meatballs literally melted in our mouths and the garlic bread was nice & crispy/crunchy on the outside and soft & buttery on the inside. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who loves Italian food!!"}
{"text":"Yay for Wolfgang Puck being my neighbor! Their happy hours are great. The ambiance is nice and the staff is friendly. Anyone I bring here really enjoys it even though it's for purposes of a quick meal. That being said, they're also very fast. Wish they would add more vegetarian options but the pizza hits the spot so I can't complain much.   Discounts for checking in! So definitely take the second to do that."}
{"text":"It's time I wrote a review of this place.  This place has been my go-to restaurant for entertaining out-of-town friends who are picky eaters.  By picky eater, I mean the full range from \"kid palate\" to vegan to full-on celiac.  This restaurant always manages to please everyone, and I had such a good experience this last time, I wonder why I don't go here more on my own.  So the last time I was here was with a group of 7 (4 adults and 3 kids).  We walked in without a reservation and the restaurant was able to seat us right away.  That alone merits a couple of stars.  The gluten-free, dairy-free adult in our group was happy with her chicken entree.  The gluten-free, dairy-free kid liked his pizza.  The adult who can eat gluten, but avoids meat, enjoyed his pizza.  The other two kids loved their pizzas.  I don't even know what my husband ate, but it was devoured.  My salmon on a bed of legumes was to die for.  I washed it down with some sangria which was wonderfully refreshing.  The restaurant just nailed everything, from the food to the drinks to the service.  The location in the Crystals Mall is delightfully airy.  It's a welcome reprieve from the chaos of the strip and the smokiness of the casinos."}
{"text":"Arrived at around 4:00 pm, which was quite early for dinner. Requested to sit at the window seats but was refused because they were all reserved(they were almost all empty until we left). Ordered a median rare steak, but it was served very rare. Fortunately the waiter was nice to bring it back to recook. The sauce on the steak tasted too sour, personally I didn't like it."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas and service.  I came here with 2 girlfriends.  We ordered 2 pizzas and 1 salad; the wild mushroom pizza, prosciutto and arugula pizza and the butter lettuce salad.  The wild mushroom pizza with bechamel sauce was out of this world.  So creamy, so much mushroom!  It was so good.  The prosciutto pizza was also very good.  Lots of prosciutto and thinly sliced.  The butter lettuce salad included bacon, blue cheese, hazelnuts and cranberries.  Great mix of flavors.  Service was great - our waiter came back to check on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed.  I would definitely come back again for pizzas!"}
{"text":"Have a place in veer so this is a go to spot when I'm in town. The food is always great and consistent. I usually get to go from here but there's no shortage in quality or presentation. The only downside I would say is that they took the spaghetti and meatball entree off the menu. Now you have to order spaghetti pasta and a side of meatballs. It went from a reasonably priced entree of $15-20 to almost double. While it's a simple and classic dish, theirs is amazing. The pizzas are great and reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"3 is perhaps a little harsh anywhere else but by the high standards of Las Vegas, this place was a bit of a disappointment. Firstly, it was a crime for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant to make a huge spelling mistake on their set menu. \"Pre-Fix\" as they called it rather than Prix Fixe. Wolfgang would be furious if only he knew. Sadly he has sold himself out these days and has too many restaurants to be able to spend any time at any of them.  I started with the Caprese salad which was the highlight of my meal. The mozzarella (or maybe it was burrata) was creamy and delicious and went well with the assortment of tomatoes.  I then had the \"Tuesday Special\" which was lasagna. It wasn't bad but I'd back myself to make one just as good at home to be honest, and I wouldn't charge over $20 for it either! The garlic bread on the side was nothing special either - again nothing bad but nothing you or I couldn't make at home.  If you want good Italian close by then head to Carbone at the Aria for some 5* food and service."}
{"text":"Had a great time at happy hour! Bartender was extremely friendly and took care of us. Okay, so, we ordered red sangria (delicious, it wasn't strong, and had a fizzy taste), meatball pizza and mushroom pizza (both delicious - we went to Lago and paid wayyyy more for this Michelin rated place than this), and tiramisu (it was a lot smaller than expected, maybe 4 bites, good but not good enough for me to order again.   As others have mentioned, all day happy hour and you can combine it with the Yelp deal!  Excited to have found this place!"}
{"text":"So far horrible service by our waiter Juan. He took out appetizer order and didn't see him again for 15 minutes. When our appetizer came out, we told the runner to call him . When he came out, he was rude. This is the second time we come here. The first time , they forgot my husbands order. Everyone's food came out except his. Never again!"}
{"text":"We plan out all of our Vegas meals - dining is the biggest reason we go to Vegas (yes, even more important than my Wizard of Oz penny slots). We had a big, rich dinner planned and at the last minute decided we were tired and wanted to back out.  Instead we decided to have at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina. I'm so glad we did!  We got a great, private table overlooking the shops. We had a very helpful and personable server along with all the others who looked after us throughout our meal.  We shared all of our items, staring with a Caesar Salad.  Then we had the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu, and the Spicy Sausage Pizza.  All of the dishes were fantastic, the pasta being a favorite.   We both ordered really delicious drinks - I ordered a nonalcoholic juice drink (Raspberry Velvet) with raspberries and cranberries and he ordered a Cucumber Gimlet which tasted like spa water.  Really happy and would come back to order other pastas and entrees that looked just as good!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp with a decent rating and thought to give it a try. Definitely recommend! The setting is cute and open air, but quiet and private. We happened to come on a Wednesday so half price wine night! We ordered the cesar salad, sea bass piccata and the prosciutto pizza. All fantastic, not a bite left. The service was also perfect. Attentive and genuine. A great experience overall."}
{"text":"Sangria was on point. So was the ragout.  Celebrated my brother in laws wedding. Had a large party and they handled it well. Everything I sampled was delicious."}
{"text":"I mean... it is in a mall... there are so many other places in Vegas (and I'm not a fan of Las Vegas), and you eat in a mall... and it is a bit overpriced. However, the food is pretty decent (note I don't say fantastic), the service is good. So basically... up to you :)"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service, year after year. Reasonably priced and centrally located. Can't beat the views either inside a phenomenal mall."}
{"text":"They have excellent service here. The servers were on top of it. They were very friendly and attentive.   I tried the mushroom pizza and the crust was just divine. I had more than one Moscow Mules. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wine!  Cute little restaurant inside the Crystals shops. The Wolfgang Puck house Pinot Noir is amazing. I have had several of the wood fired pizzas but my favorite are the Margherita pizza and the prosciutto pizza.  There is no parking at Crystals. You can either valet your car or park at Aria and walk over."}
{"text":"Great service and food and thank you to yelp 20% off check in coupon. Tomato soup reminds old fashion thick home made soup. Loved Cesar salad with anchovies. Was pleasantly surprised with food quality."}
{"text":"It was everything I expected but so much more! Our server Miguel and Antonio are what really made it for us. Service was impeccable and made it so much better. The food tasted so fresh and delicious. We will definitely be frequenting this place again very soon. One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"The four of us stopped in to share a pizza a get a few drinks before heading to another restaurant.  The pizza was really good and fresh.  The service was friendly and the drinks were good also."}
{"text":"This is a great go-to- for a casual affordable dinner in Vegas that still has a great ambience, good food, and good service.  Our appetizers were delicious, and pizzas were \"ok\" (but I'm a pan pizza gal and these are Italian thin-crust type).   Must trys:  Asparagus Salad - Delicious Prosciutto - Not only is the prosciutto good but the burrata is SOOO GOOD!  Service was solid, too!"}
{"text":"I had a late night in the Aria poker room during my last trip to Vegas, putting me on a different schedule from my friends, who woke up shortly after I went to bed. They were getting some work done at the Starbucks in the Crystals mall when I rolled out, and I decided to grab a pre-made sandwich just to throw something at my hunger. When I got there, I noticed Cucina right upstairs, and ended up treating myself to a decadent solo lunch.  Cucina is a casual Wolfgang Puck restaurant, an open space in the middle of the Crystals shopping center, a sort of food courty floor plan with tables and a bar but no walls. It was all but empty at noon on a Monday, and it felt totally natural to sit at the bar and eat alone. The bartender was friendly and welcoming, and he knew when to chat and when to leave me to eat and read my book.  It was a pretty perfect lunch, a plate of spaghetti and a glass of white wine. The house white was crisp and tasty, and I believe priced for happy hour, and I loved the spaghetti a la pomodoro. The pasta was super satisfying, cooked a spot-on al dente, tossed with an acidic tomato sugo and parmesan. I added on meatballs, and these were great, too, tender and beautifully flavored. This was just a luxurious treat, and it made me feel pampered and wonderful.  That was the day before the election, and unfortunately, I had to tarnish this lovely memory with a return visit the night of November 8, for a party that did not feel like a party. I sat at the bar surrounded by other thunderstruck Democrats watching the votes roll in, and drank several whiskeys.  I still think fondly of Cucina, and of that last blissful lunch before the election. That spaghetti was remarkably delicious, and I hope to eat it again on a happier trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best dinner experiences I have had in a loooong time. This place made me remember what fabulous food taste like and that superb service is still out there.   Came in on a Tuesday evening around 7PM without a reservation. The hostess greeted us and we were seated immediately even though they were pretty busy.   We had two servers taking care of us. Both were wonderful and very attentive with us and the surrounding diners. They made sure our beverages were always filled, checked in to see if we had any needs, and kept us in the loop regarding our food being prepared.   To start off we ordered the house salad that had mixed greens, tomatoes and fresh parmesan cheese. They split the salad for hubs and I to share. It was a simple salad with light dressing. They serve two types of bread a fresh soft yummy onion focaccia and slice French bread. The focaccia was my favorite. Being Italian I would have been content eating a basket full of it.   Next was the meatball appetizer. It came with 8 small meatballs with a tomato and pesto sauce. The meatballs were tasty with the sauce and very moist.   About 30 minutes later our Margarita pizza arrived. It was cut into 6 slices and was pipping hot right out of the oven. A very simple and yet wonderful pie. I'm not a huge fan of thin crust pizza but this one is very good. Their sauce has a great flavor with the seasoning.   Our dinner lasted about an hour and a half. They didn't rush us in and out. We were able to take our time and enjoy each dish as it arrived. They time the courses perfectly one after another.   For the salad, meat ball app and pizza with tax total and tip total was around $52.00."}
{"text":"We expect a lot from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and Cucina met our expectations. Service was outstanding (maybe because we sat down at 5:30 pm, but still have to give them credit). The calamari appetizer was top notch, my wife had the fettucini carbonara with a side of cauliflower, I had the pappardelle with a side of brussel sprouts. The size of the entrees is reasonable, not tiny and not gut-busting; the side dishes are quite large so you should consider sharing between 2 people. Our only criticism is that the carbonara, while tasty, was very salty.   Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Wife and I landed in Vegas late Thursday afternoon and wanted something near our hotel (Aria) for dinner. I read some decent reviews on yelp so we decided to check it out. We ordered some mild prosciutto as a starter, we received about 9 thinly sliced pieces, along with some olives and bread. Quite tasty. For our main we split the yukon gold potato pizza. We eat a lot of pizza, and this was probably one of the best we've had at a restaurant. It was a thin crust, so all the flavor came from its ingredients. The mascarpone and thinly sliced potatoes combined with the greens and guanciale (pork cheek) was the perfect combination of slightly sweet and savory. The servers were very attentive and kept our water glasses full throughout our meal. The total with tip was under $30. Very reasonable for a tasty Vegas meal."}
{"text":"We have come here multiple times, every time we are in Vegas. The wild boar pasta is phenomenal, and the sangria is great and very well priced. My husband and I LOVE this place! Great value and amazing food, especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"I have eaten Wolfgang puck at the MGM HOTEL and it's way better then this one..I thought it would be the same but I guess I was wrong..pizza wasn't as good the salads were ok..no I will not go back here sorry!"}
{"text":"Good place for a fast lunch and to grab a quick bite before shopping. Not exactly a food court type restaurant, but can seem that way because it's located in the middle of a mall. It's located in an open area, so a good location to people watch while eating lunch.  The food we had was not very impressive. I didn't come in with high expectations, since it was just for a quick lunch, but I wanted a tastier meal because it was a Wolfgang puck restaurant. We ordered the specials they had for the day, Rock shrimp pizza and steamed mussels. The pizza was very bland and the cheese was overwhelming in taste. Our mussels were too salty and a lot of my shells were empty.   The staff was very friendly, but the service took awhile. The restaurant was not busy at all, but it took over 45 minutes to get two entrees out. I didn't have the best experience here, so I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Finally Italian food made correctly, not dumbed down for LV. everything was perfect- the pastas, bread, salads, service.   If you don't like their food, you need to go back to Olive Garden. Ha!"}
{"text":"Today is a Sunday, we came here around noon, no so many people eat here, a lot of empty tables, we want to see the soccer game, so we seat at the bar, they have the full lunch menu on the bar as well They have a lot choice on their lunch menu, which is awesome We tried  Fritto Misto Italy meat pizza Ribeye  Peach bread pudding with ice cream The Steak is so good, well cooked and full of flavor The pizza is a little bit disappointed, as it name as, it has too much meat on the top, very heavy to eat, I did not finish it Our server is really friendly and nice Overall a good lub"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem while walking back to our hotel. It's right in the middle of a mall. They have a set menu for lunch and dinner but you can also order off the menu. We had a large group of eight and they were able to accommodate with no issues.   Really enjoyed the pastas. They were very flavourful and delicious. Two people got pizzas and didn't enjoy them as much. They were a bit dry and had very light toppings.   The sangria pitchers are delicious. My meal came out a bit later than my friends and our server brought out a wonderful selection of desserts because he felt bad.  Overall, service was excellent and the pastas are delicious. Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good & reasonable. It's convenient if you're staying at the Aria because it's in the Crystal Shops. The space is cute. We had a pizza margherita & a pizza with eggplant & spinach. Both were very tasty. I have to say that I didn't think the margherita looked as good  as it actually tasted. It had a good amount of basil too :) Note: Each pizza serves 1 person. They are the thin Italian type of pizzas."}
{"text":"I am not sure if this is fancy restaurant etiquette, you judge it.  Our group had a reservation, and were seated as planed. After talking for a bit we noticed that nearly 15 minutes rolled by without anyone pouring water or coming to us. To the waiters defense, I think he may have been waiting for drinks for the other party, but still I was ticked from walking the whole strip to get here and being very thirsty!  When the waiter did show up everything went smoothly. The prices are more then I expected for a \"$$\" place but the quality justified it well. I had a tuscan potato with garlic and basil priced around $6. It was delicious and the portion decent as well. My other friend got a cheese pizza and he said it was amazing, he said he liked how the moz and parm cheeses blended to create a UNIQUE flavor experience. My other friend is sleeping so I can't ask him. We had it yesterday you see and it was a long night that I am glad that I chose Wolfgang puck to start it off.   Sodas are $3.50 (with refills) to give a good measure on prices.    Knocked off a star because of that waiter who was late with my water. Dang him. That chap was a humorous fellow."}
{"text":"Beautiful fresh food.  Friendly service and fun open ambiance.  The heirloom tomatoes they serve are a thing of beauty.  I would come again."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar.  Shawn was the bartender for the evening.  He was so attentive to our needs and made us feel welcomed.  He had such a great personality!  We ordered the Salmon and Pappardelle dishes...both were delicious!  I hope Wolfgang appreciates what an amazing representative he has at this location!  We will definitely be back thanks to Shawn's hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken."}
{"text":"Logistically, I just don't understand this place.  They will not actually seat you until 5 and our group of 10 was there for an early dinner.  We waited at the bar and ordered some drinks off the happy hour menu which was an excellent value.  The red sangria was amazing although a lot of the small pieces of fruit were orange peels that you can't actually eat.  Anyways, how do you not allow a party to transfer the tab over to the table???!?  Seriously, with all the technological advances why would you inconvenience the customer so?  The bartender also rudely informed us we were not allowed to order any happy hour apps since we were moving to a table.  I must say I was relieved that the night began to take a turn for the better.  We had the calamari, the shrimp scampi, the platter of meats, the prosciutto, and the special flatbread pizza as appetizers.  The prosciutto and the meats were the best apps although I'd order all of them again.  I was more impressed with the complimentary bread and the appetizers than I was with my entree of linguine and clams which was pretty standard.  Good amount of clams and good pasta but it is hard to over deliver on such a dish.  The tiramisu was excellent and a nice portion.  Overall, the apps are a 5, the entree 4, and the service was a dud.  If you're not in a hurry and don't need a lot of attentiveness from you're waiter, then this place ultimately is a great value, especially in the location.  Sounds like they need some better management and logistics."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food and smoke free. Received 20% off with a Yelp check in. 3 course dinner meals were $35 a piece and delicious."}
{"text":"Lots of places to choose for food, and was very happy with Puck's. Pizzas were flavorful, grilled veggies and salads were great. Decent beers on tap. All around worth the money."}
{"text":"This place was really yummy! From the pizzas to the pastas to the desserts, they did not disappoint. We had a party of 7. Great place for larger parties. You can make reservations on open table. Service was excellent. They offer gluten free pizza and pasta. Everyone was pleased with what they order. We would highly recommend the spaghetti, meatballs, pappaedelle, ravioli, and pistachio budino. The sea bass was good, but when we go back, we will definitely get the pastas! So fresh, cooked to perfection and sauced just right."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recent trip to Vegas... wow! Pizza was fantastic. Also had the caesar salad with garlic croutons, humbolt fog blue cheese, and butter lettuce. Different spin on the classic caesar salad. Very good.  Best part of the meal was the mac n' cheese. It comes out still sizzling in a cast iron bowl. The hot bowl creates a crispy layer of cheese that brings the mac n' cheese to a whole nother level.  Wow. Great late night dinner."}
{"text":"In City Center, pleasant, open location.  Good place to get away from alas Vegas madhouse.  Food was fine but not memorable."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the pizzas and it was fantastic. Service was also great. My wife and I got a side of meatballs with our meal and they were delicious. I would come back for sure. 4 stars only cus to get 5 i have to love the place.  it is in the crystal mall inside of the Aria complex so it took us a little while to find it but it was a great time. The Aria is beautiful and the pizza was great. I was a fan."}
{"text":"Very quiet inside the building, very slow at the restaurant which is surprising given the good food at a good price. We were one of two tables in the restaurant for a Saturday evening. We were given the bar menu in addition to the regular menu which had good deals on pizzettes and appetizers. Waiter Tony was very friendly and professional. The pizzette was maybe two inches smaller radius than a pizza for half the price. The pasta was fantastic, fresh made noodles, perfect Bolognese sauce and real shredded beef. I would make this my first choice for Italian on the strip."}
{"text":"Across from the Aria (park there), inside the Crystals shopping above Starbucks... this was one of the BEST meals that I've had in Vegas.  From the Brioche to the squash soup and the Baby Kale Salad was amazing !  My date had the Chilean Sea Bass special at lunch - he said it was fabulous too.  Dessert was the Tira Misu - yummy !  Service fabulous, I felt like a Queen.  Met one of the chef's \"Lucky\" - very nice young man - service with a smile !  Definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and my boyfriend's brother and his girlfriend for a late dinner.    First the appetizers: Calamari and Mushroom Pizza.  I didn't try the calamari but everyone else said it was good.  The pizza had so many mushrooms on it that they were falling off!  Yum!  I got gnocchi as my entree which was very good.  My boyfriend and his brother both ordered the Lamb Sirloin.  They asked the waitress for mint jelly and were upset that they didn't have any.  They even went so far as to ask the chef to make them a mint sauce....giving the waitress directions for doing so.  I was so embarrassed!  But she was a trooper and took it all in stride,  And when it all came down to it, they both enjoyed their meals.  The other girl in our party ordered the Chicken Piccata and seemed to enjoy it.    I would go back for sure, just without the company of my boyfriend's brother...he's a bit hard to take!  But like I said, the waitress was excellent with all his demands and made the dining experience that much better."}
{"text":"WOW ...this is definitely a wolfgang puck restaurant.   The mushroom risotto balls were little balls of crispy creamy heaven. So delightful!!  Proscuitto Pizza was good.  Edive salad was quite interesting. A bit heavy on the blue cheese side.  I definitely would go back for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing food and service!   Fresh ingredients and great customer attentiveness.   Everything is so flavorful. Although located in the shopping area behind Aria - a more quiet and peaceful environment was provided.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for a bachelorette dinner before a night out on the town. Our server, Tony, was PHENOMENAL! So personable, quick witted, and so attentive while juggling multiple large groups. Funny enough the manager, Moon, was a past coworker and was truly a gem as well. They not only provided us with a tasty dinner, quick service, and clear communication on the timing of each item coming out, they also gave us some free desserts to sample. From the hostess to the bussers, everyone was so gracious and pleasant. Excited to go back again and try more!  The sorbet dessert plate was our favorite, great light ending to a plate of pasta for most of us."}
{"text":"Wolfgang puck always has good food.  I have been to a few of his places.   I just had spaghetti and meatballs but the meatballs were great. Service was excellent.  Dessert was tasty.  I would go again next time I'm in town.  My buddy would also and he is a local."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a party of 20, but when we arrived at the scheduled time, the staff was still \"setting up our table\" so we had to wait for nearly half an hour to be seated. As we got seated, we had to wait another who knows how long to get some service. Some people were getting impatient, so they went to gamble as we placed their orders in for them. As we all got our food after the others returned, they assumed their orders were still being prepared. 10-15 min later, we had to wave the server down to check on the orders as well as refill our glasses. He comes back to tell us that their orders were never placed and forgets to get us more water on top of that.  The food was okay, but for the price we were paying for mediocre food, I wished their service was a bit more attentive. They also charged us a hefty cake cutting fee of $50. FIDDY! They didn't even cut the cake for us!"}
{"text":"Made a quick reservation here on Christmas day and they were available for 5 people at 6:30pm. Honestly, the food was pretty good so I'm disappointed that there weren't a lot of people, but I guess in comparison to all the glitz and glamour of all the Las Vegas restaurants, this restaurant gets lost. (especially since its in The Shops at Crystals. The Shops at Crystals is like desert land compared to the Strip.)  Food: We started off with the minestrone soup and shared it between all 5 of us. It was decent soup. Couldn't complain. We also got the garlic bread since there was no complimentary bread unfortunately.   Mushroom Pizza: The mushroom pizza was flavorful. The crust was thin but not too thin. It had a fried egg on top, which I love.   Linguine: Solid linguine, fresh seafood.    Pork Chop: I'm not a big fan of pork chops as I find it too dry/dense sometimes but it was a decent dish. The polenta on the bottom was very well done.   Sea Bass: I loved the sea bass. It was very flaky and flavorful. The lemon-caper butter sauce was on point. The side vegetable was broccolini and that's my favorite, so I am a little bias to this dish already.   This is a nice little spot away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip. Definitely recommend it for a casual dinner, especially if you're staying at the Aria next door."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Food was really good. Had the margherita pizza, grilled meatballs, and a salad. Our waiter Quetzi was great! Super sweet. Would definitely make this place my Vegas regular spot"}
{"text":"In the heart of the city center, we stopped in to get cool from the Vegas heat. The Moscow mules were good and in a copper mug. We shared a spicy pepperoni pizza (8 or so slices) and butter lettuce salad. So fresh and perfect for a lunch bite. $70 bill for lunch, but it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Tolles Essen und toller Service! Great food and great service!und endlich mal nichts frittiertes - And  finally nothing was fried :-)"}
{"text":"Good location, and prices are really reasonable for Vegas. The service was great and professional. The food was OK--the pizza and the bruschetta were just fine. The sangria was good."}
{"text":"I'd prefer if they treated this place as casual dinner vs charging 25+ for a plate and to wait 30 minutes for drinks and food. Service was below average and food was good because it was extra salty.  I had a better experience at MGM Wolfgang."}
{"text":"This has become a frequent \"go to\" place when we visit Vegas. Food is excellent, with good pizza and great pasta dishes. I really enjoy the Rigatocini, my wife likes the Carbonara. Service the last visit was off a bit, but this was unusual."}
{"text":"Surprisingly VERY Good....you think with so many restaurants, things can get convoluted.  But its really really good.  Service on the slow side, but thats because we had a party of 20.    Food was pleasantly great, even for city center standards.  I'd come back in heart beat...."}
{"text":"Hmmm... pretty disappointing dinner experience. 7pm reservations with prompt seating. Got water service right away but about 10 minutes more before our waiter came to take our drink order. Since we wanted to leave close to 8:15 to catch a show, we gave our dinner order at the same time.   I ordered the $35 dinner prix fixe (risotto app-yummy but like a full entree and this choice was an add-on price --guess I missed this), salmon entree (pretty good but also had an add-on price), and the donuts); hubby ordered the bruschetta app and the shrimp scampi (small shrimp more like a bay shrimp-the sauce was lacking garlic or anything flavorful); guests ordered chicken parm (seemed to be a huge portion with what I believe was a beautiful basil topping); and the kale salad (walnuts and other fab goodies), a side of grilled potatoes, and a side of garlic cheese bread. After about 20 minutes two of us received our apps. Then we waited ...and waited.   Our water glasses were kept filled but after another 15 minutes we asked about our order --which finally arrived a full hour after we placed our order or an hour ten since we arrived. Since this was the time we wanted to exit, we scarfed our meals. The waiter did not return to ask how our food was or if we wanted another drink or anything else. We asked our water server to bring a roll or bread to accompany the scampi, but it never came.   At about 8:30 we flagged our waiter and asked for to-go boxes for my entree and the desert. We paid for the bill (after sorting out the extra costs in the prix fixe order), and then dashed to our show... which we made just as the lights came down. Having been a fan of the original Wolfgang Puck restaurant on Sunset in LA, I am sorry to learn that his chain restaurants lack any of the wow from the flagship. ...sniff..."}
{"text":"After our amazing meal at Puck's Bar and Grill at MGM, all we could do was lament that we hadn't discovered it sooner. Now we had family in town (who wouldn't be interested) followed by extended travel, when all we really wanted to do was go notch every Puck eatery that we'd ignored all these years on the grounds of Puck-the-man coming off as a bit of a wanker on TV. Cruel fate!  But one night mercy struck: our guests were occupied and we were hungry. Okay, where could we go quickly and casually? We bolted for the Pizzeria.  First came the bread. Not a delicate basket but a sliced mini-loaf with butter. Golden and crusty outside, golden and fragrant inside with flecks of herbs and some decent-sized holes in an otherwise tight crumb. (You can tell I've been reading bread cookbooks.) \"Quite tasty.\"  Mike, his stomach keeping in mind our relocation from Vegas in the too-near future, ordered a starter of grilled meatballs, and we both got the butter leaf salad with Gorgonzola, hazelnuts, and egg. (Mike's with the customary bacon, mine without.)  Thumbs up from Mike on the meatbals. I liked my salad better than the Greek-ish one at the Bar and Grill - fewer ingredients kept the flavours from being lost, perhaps. Still, I've had more interesting and tastier salads at so many other places around town that this is part of the reason Puck loses a star here. As much as I love a good salad course, I wouldn't bother with one next time. Perhaps if you're not a vegetarian you don't feel so \"meh\" about what he offers. (That said, Mike liked the salad well enough but agreed it wasn't anything special.)  We each got our own pizza (partially because of our different preferences, partially because we were already excited by the idea of having some Puckian leftovers for the next day). Choosing what to get, though, was so hard. As a vegetarian, usually I have to pick between \"variety of vegetables that will always include something icky,\" \"variety of cheeses,\" and \"Margherita.\" Here I could have Margherita, but I could also have \"mushroom with bechamel, fontina, arugula, and thyme.\" Or I could have \"eggplant with crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and oregano.\" Or maybe I could try \"Yukon Gold potato with mascarpone, Brussel sprouts, and rosemary, hold the guanciale.\" I hate Brussel sprouts and yet it still sounded good!  In the end I chose the \"caramelized onion pizza with creme fraiche, arugula, and olives.\" Mike had the Italian meat, I think. Something with pepperoni, anyway. I don't recall because my pizza was So Darn Delicious that all other pizzas discontinued to exist. Oh, that fluffy, chewy, soft thoroughly cooked crust! (If you like it thin-and-floppy, this isn't your place.) The near-buttery onions that melted on my tongue without being greasy. The fresh little pops of the arugula. And the olives, so discreetly flavourful without being unpleasantly bitter. How would I ever be able to face little black rings from a chain pizzeria again?  The customers at the table next to us claimed no room for dessert, and I felt so sorry for them. People, this may have been only my second Puck experience, but even I knew you have to wear your eating britches and pace yourself because skipping dessert is just going to make the Baby Julia Child cry. But I understood their plight because pushing away that pizza when I was still hungry took previously untested levels of will power.   Our dessert choice wasn't on the online menu; we shared a piece of chocolate concoction that was like dark chocolate cake on the bottom and dense/creamy chocolate pie on top, with a nutty edge and served with cream. \"Mmmm.\" \"Mmmm.\" \"Mmmm.\" \"MMMmmm.\" Dinner conversation became a bit stilted for awhile.  Service was great; our waitstaff team of two was happy to answer questions and soda refills were timely. The seating didn't feel too crowded, even though the place was full and therefore we had to sit at a two-top. It would have been nicer if the tables for two were a little further apart (there goes the rest of that star), although I know my cultural need for that much personal space isn't universal. (But should I have been so aware about one table's decision not to have dessert, and another table's decision to have the same salad we did?) Still, not a dealbreaker.  And of course, the best part was driving home with our pizzas in the backseat. We couldn't wait to be hungry again!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my bachelorette party and had the greatest time. The food was good - but the service was fantastic. Our waiter, Apollo, went above and beyond to make my night special and memorable. Truly, that was the best service I've ever had - and I dine out quite a bit! The torchio (carbonara) was the best thing ordered, but both the bolognese and ravioli were good as well. I will 100% return here next time I come to Vegas! Thanks Apollo for contributing so greatly to an amazing night!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour specials ALL DAY.  This is such an amazing find for Vegas--good prices in a clean, beautiful setting.  They have a handful of pizzas on the HH menu.  They are personal sized for like 7$!  On one visit, Mr. DJ and I ordered 2 of these pizzas and calamari--this was more than enough to fill us up.  On another visit we ordered one pizza and these fried mushroom risotto balls (all on the HH menu).  The risotto balls were amazing....you must order these.  Add a couple glasses of wine and you're good to go.  A HUGE plus for having the NBA playoffs on TV.  Overall great experience here...attentive/welcoming/friendly staff, pretty setting, awesome food for an amazing price, and playoffs on TV."}
{"text":"Wolfie, I gotta tell ya that you got 4 stars because the food was so delicious, BUT: 1. You didn't do the most basic of things any good host knows, which is to bring something for guests to snack on while they wait for their order.  2. You didn't bring the food out around the same time for everyone on the table.  3. You took almost 45 minutes to bring out 3 pasta dishes in a nearly empty restaurant.   If the food hadn't been as tasty, we were shocked considering the service deficiencies, you would have had 3 starts."}
{"text":"This was my first Wolfgang Restaurant, so I was super excited to experience everything it had to offer. Tony our waiter, was amazing, great positive attitude and Tony didn't skip a beat. He made our dinner very enjoyable, his energy is infectious and we loved the environment and food was perfect.   Cucina hit the spot and went above and beyond for us."}
{"text":"Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere,though very worn down furniture, at an expensive price point.  Take advantage of the great Yelp Check in option to score 20% off your check, now we are talking.  The pizza is thin crust and quite good.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants and service my husband and I have ever experienced! We sat at the bar for quicker service due to our cirque du soleil show that started shortly. The bartender and bar back were extremely efficient and friendly and did their job well. Not in Vegas often but will definitely visit the restaurant again when we do return."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!!!  For our party, we each did the prix fixe $35 dinner - EVERYTHING was lovely BUT the gnocchi. We all speculated that extra salt was accidentally knocked over into this dish as it made the dish inedible."}
{"text":"Food was good (though not as good as i was expecting). Service was bellow average! During the whole dining experience the waiter only came to my table four or five times, those were to either bring food/drink or to take order."}
{"text":"We shared a bruschetta, a meat pasta, a pizza and a bottle of wine. The bruschetta was so good! The waiter was friendly and made sure to keep refilling our glasses. The restaurant is in the middle of a shopping plaza, but other than that it was a solid spot for dinner"}
{"text":"I have a deep love for Wolfgang Puck's restaurants and this is the only one that strip that  I hadn't tried. Great service, from the hostess to our busser that I'm presuming was in training. He was doing a great job, but the manager was pulling him aside every once in awhile to clarify details. The food is always great, especially the pizzas, but I thought my salad was overdressed. Still it's never disappointing at any of his concepts. I'll see you again next time Wolfgang."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service. Nice views from seating area. Food is well worth the wait for them cooking it."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite before shopping. We walked in and was seated momentarily. We weren't expecting much from our meal here as it was more of a fast lunch for us. The food quality etc. here is a little better to what you would find at any California Pizza Factory. There was no \"wow\" factor to our meal, but it was still enjoyable.   Below is what we ordered for two adults:   Wood Fired Oven Pizza  Barbeque Chicken Pizza $16 (I no longer see this item on their menu) It was delicious!   Wood Fired Oven Pizza  Wild Mushroom, Bechamel, Fontina,Thyme, Arugula $14  This pizza was good too...great choice for vegetarians!   Caesar Salad Creamy Garlic Dressing, Parmesan Croutons, White Anchovies $12  Overall, The food was better than the service. The service was below average in my honest opinion. It wasn't busy when we went, yet we constantly had to flag down the server when we needed something because he never bothered  to check on us or refill our drinks etc. once the food was served. We would probably give them another chance as the food was good, and it's conveniently located in the Crystals."}
{"text":"We came here for a light dinner, and our group of four shared a pizza and an order of ravioli.  The bread (which was given to us about 15 minutes after we sat down) was good.  We ordered a pizza margherita, which was excellent.  We also ordered the veal ravioli, which two of us loved and two of us hated, so maybe it was just a personal taste issue.  I found it to be extremely over-seasoned (salt and pepper), and lacking in any other flavor.  I ordered an iced tea, which was extremely small at $4 a glass and no refills.    Overall, we had a good experience and would return if we were in the  area, but wouldn't make a special trip (i.e. leave a casino) to dine here."}
{"text":"While the service was delightful, the food was certainly sub-par with the exception of the refreshing bruschetta which was kissed with pesto to add some flare. The hubs ordered the pork chop while I had the eggplant parm. Both dishes had a heavy hand with salt, which nearly rendered the dishes inedible. If they had backed down on the salt, I think we would have had a pleasant meal. Notably, they had half off wine bottles when we went which sounded amazing. Sadly our Zin wasn't great, and the waiter brought it out in an ice bucket to keep it chilled. I've never seen red wine iced in my life...  While the location was convenient, we won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"BEST FOOD I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE! I had the Gnocchi with a sausage bolognese sauce. Small-ish portion on that, but the other portions were great. My lady had the prosciutto pizza and we shared a tomato bruschetta appetizer. The cocktails were strong, the wine was tasty, and the service (Steven) was great. Best $77 I've spent in a long time."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I would put the price at $$$ and the ambience and service were a bit weak.  The Crystals shopping center is a strangely subdued place in general.  It doesn't even seem like it should be in Las Vegas because it is quiet and sterile looking.  Crystals has a great selection of high-end stores.  That being said, one gets the idea that nobody ever shops in them.  And as you look out over the mall from Cucina, you might catch yourself feeling a bit somber.  UPDATE: after re-reading my review, I have changed their rating to three stars."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for St Paddy's Day to try their happy hour bar menu.  Had the wings, mushroom pizza and calamari and the requisite Guinnesses... Sounds typical like any Irish pub grub but with Wolfgang's restaurants, there's a refinement of \"how can I do it better? The wings diavolo was infused with the right amount of spiciness and flavours rather than plain baked and bowl tossed sauce.  The mushroom pizza was great as well.  I believe (if I can remember the explanation from my last visit restaurant side) to be infused with honey.  My SO thought the calamari was fantastic as well(I'm not a squid) fan...."}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying at the Aria (which by the way is the greatest hotel in Vegas), and decided to have a late lunch at this cute restaurant inside the Aria mall. The 3 of us decided to order bruschetta as appetizers and split two pizzas which were more than enough food for us. The bruschetta was delicious! The crostini perfectly toasted and the tomato and basil toppings were fresh and flavorful. The pizzas were delicious as well. We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the mushroom and carmelized onion. The prosciutto pizza was the best one. Thinly sliced, arugula, cheese, great combo. Considering its a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, we wouldnt have expected less of this place."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place was inside the Aria because it made me fall in love and appreciate the architecture inside Aria just from sitting at the restaurant. The restaurant is simple yet classy. I love how they project old B&W films on the back wall near the bar, definitely different from anything I've seen at ANY pizzeria!  We started off with the Caesar salad and fried calamari. The calamari tasted surprisingly light, it was the best I've ever had. It also came with 3 different dipping sauces that varied from the Mild to Spicy type spectrum.  I ordered the lasagna and was not disappointed at all because it just felt so homemade and was well balanced in regard to cheese, herbs and meat. My boyfriend got the veal and mushroom ravioli and said he enjoyed it. Didn't end up getting dessert cause I was already stuffed and super satisfied.  I would definitely want to come back to try their other dishes! This was a perfect, random find."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. Egg plant was soggy. Ribeye was tough. Too hot in the restaurant. Highly recommend you go elsewhere.  Great waitress. Crappy, overpriced meal."}
{"text":"Came with 3 girlfriends and sat at a high-top table at the bar.  We shared an Arugula pizza, butter lettuce salad, Eggplant, and special Short Ribs.  The pizza was dry and disappointing but everything else was delicious.  Drinks were a bit expensive (martini $15) for a chain and the Short Rib portion was very small for $32 but overall the experience was very nice."}
{"text":"Food is good, pretty much anything you have is going to be tasty and the price is okay;"}
{"text":"My friends and I were walking around Aria and found another Wolfgang Puck establishment in the middle of the City Center mall.   I've always been a fan of Wolfgang Pucks culinary style and dropped in for a quick lunch.   The hostess was extremely welcoming as she was able to handle a group of 12 with ease.   She seated us right outside the kitchen area w. the frosted glass and decided to order away.   We had the following dishes:  Crispy Calamari with Spicy Garlic Aioli:  4/5  the spicy garlic Aioli was delicious but portions were tiny.   One order only feeds two people at best.  Pizza Margherita: 1/5  the waitress warned us that these are appetizer portion...boy was she right, paper thin and definitely not worth getting.  Oysters:  4/5  they were fresh but where were they from?  gotta give me the locale, east, west? type? something.....  Main dish was Mussels w. Chirizo - 5/5  amazingly tasty.  Mussels were tender and that validates how fresh they were.  The chirizo gave it that little kick to enhance the flavor.  Ambiance: 5/5  great lunch spot  Service: 2.5/5  some of the dishes came out at odd times, they need to be in sync so they don't piss off the other half of the table."}
{"text":"The Rigatoncini, Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic, Parmesan Reggiano was absolutely delicious. The service was exceptional. My son's pizza was also very good."}
{"text":"a bit crunched on time, we ordered takeout to eat in our room from this restaurant.  everything was pretty smooth.  we ordered.  for larger orders. they take ccs.  we picked it up and it was delicious!    i thought everything we had was good!  we had salad.  the caesar was yummy.  proscuitto pizza was aweseom!  lasgna awesome!    as expected, takeout wasnt piping hot but oh well"}
{"text":"I was really happy with everything about this place, except the serving size. The 20% off yelp coupon was really nice. Our server Vance was super sweet and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, and he was really patient with us when we asked him to describe everything and we took forever to decide too. He also brought me yummy donut holes with dipping sauces for my birthday free of charge :)   My only complaint is that the serving size is tiny for what they charge you. My torchio pasta plate was tiny and $22... it was delicious but barely any pasta on the plate :("}
{"text":"Actually quite impressed with this place!  The decor is very chic, but comfortable, the service was spot on - excellent drink and food recommendations, and the food was quite good too!"}
{"text":"Limited pizza menu to be Italian. Poor service, i only irdered water and dound my glass empty more than a few times, waiting for a refill. Beautiful bathroom, but dirty as a pigsty!"}
{"text":"Came by because we were so hungry, just a group of young adults with a bunch of Fat Tuesday's.   I thought it might be a little inappropriate or weird considering it was a sit down place & we had like 6 fat Tuesday's on the table, but the hostesses were incredibly nice & so was our waitress.   We tipped them well :) I hate when places judge you based on your age & they definitely didn't do that.  Anyways we had the following, and everything was good & consistent:  Prosciutto San Daniele, Burrata Mozzarella, Cracked Black Pepper, Aged Balsamic (4 stars)= This was really good with the aged balsamic, needed something else though, maybe tomatoes or a pesto to balance out the dish, or just more balsamic :)  Margherita, Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomato, Basil (4 stars)= Really good flavor with the San Marzano tomatoes, those are my favorite!  Spicy Pepperoni, Calabrian Chili, Fresh Ricotta (4 stars)= Different and yummy, spicy pepperoni with the ricotta worked really well together!  Roasted Eggplant, Garlic Spinach, Fresh Mozzarella (4 stars)= Normally don't like eggplant, but this wasn't bad, the flavor was good!  I would come back if I was in the area for some yummy Pizza!"}
{"text":"Neither of us were surprised that we walked away from our dinner here fully impressed by the food and the service. It's a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, after all, so right or wrong, you expect a bit more from one of his establishments. Or maybe that's just us.   At any rate, we walked over to this restaurant pretty soon after we pulled in to Vegas. It was a long drive from home, and though we were both tired, our need for sustenance trumped our need for sleep. We did a quick search of restaurants in the area (the map we had open looked like it had a bad case of measles, so many red dots appeared), and narrowed our choices down to two places.   On our way to Wolfgang's place, we passed the other restaurant we had been contemplating, but neither of us got the warm and fuzzies from it, so we kept on.   We didn't realize that the restaurant was located in what I can only compare to as the high-end shopping malls back home. Lots of glitter. Lots of bling. Lots of shops I can't afford. It was strange, but hey, it's Vegas!   Anyway, we were seated right away, and our waiter - friendly, knowledgeable, opinionated without being pushy - gave us time to settle in, browse the drink and food menus, and decide on our entree choices.   Truly, I wanted the grilled sea bass, but couldn't justify spending $32 on that dish alone. Normally I don't balk at food prices, especially when I'm on any kind of a vacation, but I couldn't get past it. So, I went with the Pappardelle, instead. Brilliant choice, as it turned out.   The pasta was fantastic! I had to force myself to slow down and eat like a lady, because otherwise I could have just tilted my head back and dumped the entire contents of the plate down my gullet in one shot.   The meat sauce was incredible. I've had some pretty tasty meat sauces in my life, but this one was by far my favorite. Tender chunks of meat married perfectly with the slight acidity of the tomatoes, which perfectly paired with the pasta and the cheese. Oh, yeah. It makes my mouth water just remembering it!   My husband ordered the linguine pasta, and he enjoyed that immensely. They loaded him up on shellfish, and he kept commenting on the flavor of the sauce and how tender the noodles were. At least, I think that's what he was saying. It was hard to listen to him over all the yummy noises I was making in my head, while consuming my own dinner.   And while the plates didn't look overloaded when they were set down in front of us, they certainly filled us up right.   Had we been in Vegas longer than the weekend, we absolutely would have gone back. Service and food quality will always bring us back. Serving bread with the meal would have been a slam-dunk, though."}
{"text":"Happy, Happy, Happy. I'm hoping every visit here will be as good as our visit today. We ordered, for our appetizer, the Salumi & Cheese board; for our meal, the Chicken Piccata & Broccolini; a side of Meatballs; the Margarita Pizza; & a fabulous dark beer ( Left Hand Stout). Our waiter Tony made our dining experience exemplary, as did supporting staff. The view of City Center shop was nice too. Price averages out to around $50 a person for dinner. We'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"We had wanted a light lunch (the first morning after, ugh, rough..) and this was the perfect place for it. This Wolfgang Puck location sits on the second floor of City Center, kitty corner from Brunello Cucinelli for location reference. Clean modern open decor with a lot of light. Comfortable seating.  We were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She introduced us to a few menu highlights and checked on us throughout the meal. I went with the butter lettuce salad topped with delicious Gorgonzola cheese, hazelnut, bacon and egg. Decided to add some grill chicken for protein (aka, coat the stomach for more drinking. Hey when in Vegas...). It was exactly what I wanted. Light, but tasty and fulfilling. The Hazelnut added a wonderful flavor to to the dish. Also on the table were the Endive salad, Chicken Piccata and steamed clams Linguine; all very well done according to everyone.   I highly recommend WP Pizzeria & Cucina for a light lunch or easy dining. Prices were very fair (compare to other established Vegas restaurants). I wouldn't say it's a culinary experience, but the food is well-done and the atmosphere and service were top notch."}
{"text":"Great pizza in a lovely and quiet place away from the crazy strip. If you're on your own, absolutely perfect to sit by the bar and all the staff will make sure you're not sat in silence for an hour or so. Great place."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  We had the Baby Kale Salad and 2 pizzas.  The salad was so delicious that I am trying to recreate it at home.  We ordered a plain margarita pizza then added our own toppings, my side was without cheese. It was consumed so quickly and seeing we had a long drive back to PHX, we ordered the same exact pizza again!  Its safe to say we were full.  The location is inside the Crystals Mall, which is a beautiful indoor high end mall."}
{"text":"They treat you like family at Cucina.  Absolutely a highly memorable night when we were served by Tony.  The setting is in a mall steps away from the Aria .  Fare is mid scale Modern Italian by perennial celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.  Single page menu with pasta, pizza, and meat dishes.  I had the halibut and it was a small fish alive e over a bed of asparagus."}
{"text":"While we enjoyed the food very much (had a pizza and the porchetta sandwich), the staff made this a 3 star versus 5 star experience.  We went for lunch and the restaurant opened after posted hours(frustrating when you are on a schedule).  Also, the staff was much more interested in watching soccer on TV than getting/refilling drinks and taking our order.  Just not the service we expected."}
{"text":"The restaurant is inside the Crystal in great setting. However we were disappointed that one of the dishes that we ordered was badly overcooked. The pork was like rubber and hard to chew. The waitress took the dish back to the kitchen. Although we indicated that we probably wouldn't want to try the dish anymore, we were kind of surprised that there wasn't a single word from the kitchen or chef on the dish. Guess the chef must have thought that he cooked that way on purpose. When the check came, everything was charged although we did return 1/2 of the more expensive dish due to the poor execution of the dish. Just showed that they didn't care! Will never go to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong on Vegas strip for good food and Cucina by Wolfgang Puck is a good spot to go! Located in the Aria area, this restaurant is the Italian spot, not to get confused with the one in MGM, which is more American food. We called in ahead of time because we had a lot of people bug to be honest, it wasn't that packed when we got there anyways. Full disclosure, probably because of the prices. However, the service is very good here and very proficient. Although it not a huge restaurant, they can accommodate both couples to large parties. Food menu is simple and the quality is superb. Portions are on the smaller side but maybe that is for the best because of how delicious it all is! Definitely a place you could eat, chat and loose track of time. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Overall, any Wolfgang Puck is a good spot to eat and Cucina is a great place to do it, whether it be an intimate diner or a big party. Definitely recommend checking out!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience overall! We had tickets for the 9:30 showing of Zarkana at Aria and we arrived at Cucina a little before 8:30. We mentioned that we were running late and that we had tickets to the show and they were very accommodating. Our food was brought out in less than 20 minutes (we ordered pasta and no appetizer) and it was delicious. Not the best Spaghetti Pomodoro I've ever had, but it was certainly fulfilling.  I was very surprised to see how empty it was at 8:30 on a Friday night, but then again, it was inside a shopping center, so it was a quiet escape from busy Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Soup was bland, cheese ravioli was tasty. We had to request bread, but it wasn't served like the pictures on yelp. The pizzas have creative ingre, but not all that tasty."}
{"text":"I had never tried a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and I always try to have at least one nice meal while I'm in Vegas, so this seemed to fit the mold nicely. It was a nice experience, and although I'm not sure I would rush back, it is not because of the experience, but just based on the fact that there are so many other restaurants in the genre to try in Vegas.   I have to say, the one thing that absolutely made the experience was our waiter. The guy was good. from the very beginning to the very end, he was an absolute professional, and very good at what he did. His energy and enthusiasm did not wane, and he always made me feel as if I was his only table. That is the mark of a good waiter. He was also incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about his product.   The restaurant itself, depending on your perspective, is in a nice and accessible location. It is right in a mall between the Cosmo and Aria/Vdara. It is an upscale mall, and the atmosphere is very relaxing and low key. It is an open design restaurant on the second floor, and overlooks the mall, so there is plenty to look at, but the second floor location keeps it quiet and private. Overall, it is a nice spot as long as you're not disappointed that it's not right on the main strip or its own building.   The food itself was good. I have the woodfired sausage and cheese pizza, and I thought it was wonderful. My girlfriend had the egg plant Parmesan, and she thought it was good, although it wasn't the best she's had. The appetizer was a cheese and cold cut plate, and I thought that was one of the best parts! The prices were somewhat expensive, but I expected that being Las Vegas and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. You have to pay if you want to play.   Overall, this was a nice restaurant, although I'm not sure I would rush back there on the next trip. I would, however, try one of his other restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is an extremely pleasant place to dine in Las Vegas. Situated in the beautiful high end mall Crystal, you are away from the noisy machines and surrounded by lovely white decor.  We stopped in for an early dinner,  just on a whim as passing by.  We sat at the bar and were waited on by a wonderful, friendly bartender - Shawn.  We started out with a charcuterie for one (don't believe - definitely sharable)  $12 - what a deal!  We then ordered two misa salads with four meatballs and a small side of spaghetti . ALL were fantastic. Best meatballs I've ever had.  Of course accompanied with Chianti. Finished off with cappuccino which came with a delightful chocolate candy.  Stop by this place , you will not be disappointed! What a delight!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. We had the kids with us and were worried whether they had a kids menu and if they kids would eat well but to our surprise kids had a great time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  I've been here several times and the service has always been good and the food excellent.  This time I was a little disappointed, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  The host was not friendly at all.  The server was very friendly and helpful at first.  Then he said, \"If you need me I'll be around. I don't want you to wait for anything.\"  I got a bad feeling and sure enough, he disappeared and I had to ask a busboy to find him twice.  Anyway, the food was excellent.  They wine list is excellent and has one of my all time favorites by the glass.  Seghesio Zinfandel.  I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"It was my last meal in Las Vegas before I had to catch a flight and I'm so happy I stopped by Cucina. Service was great - my water glass was never empty. I ordered the rigatoni, a friend ordered the salmon, and another friend ordered the NY strip steak. We were all satisfied with our dish. My pasta dish definitely hit the spot and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The bolognese sauce wasn't too salty or underseasoned. It was perfect for me.   My friend who ordered her salmon cooked medium really enjoyed it and said it wasn't too dry or over/under seasoned. My other friend ordered the NY strip steak rare and enjoyed it. We were all very pleased with what we ordered and what was really nice is that the portions are perfect. It wasn't too small or too big - just enough to feel satiated. I will definitely come back again when I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This Puck's is in Crystals at City Center, a retail/entertainment mall. I had low expectations, but it turned out to be a good meal with equally descent wine/beer selection. Service was attentive. An upscale mall dining experience. I'd go again. Reservations accepted on OpenTable."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service here.  Can't remember the waiter who served me, but he was very receptive and aware (if my water was low) and was not intrusive but not non-existent either.  Pizza was delicious!  Crust was perfect- chewy but crispy and thin. The rigatoni and parpadelle was also very good.  A quaint place and they have a nice little bar inside the restaurant as well.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that I liked this place as it was not my first choice but I was pleasantly surprised at the good service and great food.   The raviolis were out of this world and left me begging for a second plate of them.  I was a good boy and did not order more.  Great cocktails.  Cool view of mall from above and fun to people watch."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for the all day happy hour menu! We had the margherita pizza, meatballs and sausage with peppers. The crust on the pizza was really good, the meatballs were good, but didn't wow me, but the sausage and peppers was better than I could have expected (I am not a sausage fan). I really liked it and so did my husband. The bartendar was very knowledgabel and friendly. We had a great time sitting at the bar and having some bar snacks oh and a glas of wine. We would return."}
{"text":"Service was great at first, then later inattentive.   Food was full of amazing flavors and pretty sizable portions."}
{"text":"This review is really a 4 1/2 star rating but the ambiance really pushed it up to a perfect rating.  My honeybabe and I came here for dinner on a late Sunday night. Despite this restaurant being at the ever-so-prestigious Crystals Shopping Center, prices for our drinks and entrees were not as expensive as we thought.  Honeybabe started off with a delicious soup that had chicken, vegetables and chickpeas in it. Very flavorful! For our entrees, I got Rigatoncini with Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic and Parmesan Reggiano. He ordered Veal Raviolis with Porcini Mushrooms, Brown Butter Sauce and Crisp Sage. We both LOVED our entrees!!!!!! Everything was cooked to our liking and service was attentive throughout the night.  One thing is for sure; this restaurant have perfect portion control. I'm an extremely small eater. Half of an appetizer and I'm practically full already. That's how easy it is for me lol. But that night, I was able to finish my pasta. Every bite. Done. AND....best part was, I wasn't overly full....I didn't feel fat and bloated.   We definitely enjoyed our food and can't wait to be back. Next time....we want to try their wood fried oven pizzas. I got my eye on that spicy pepperoni pizza. Yumm!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best meal (and service) we received all week in Vegas. Definitely a great value for the quality of the food and will absolutely recommended everyone I know that's visiting Vegas to come here."}
{"text":"Just felt like a chain with good food but nothing special or memorable about it. I had the sea bass it was well prepared and crispy. The restaurant is mostly good pizza and pasta with nice decor but wouldn't go out of my way to have it unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and clean. Staff was attentive and friendly, always there to top off a glass or take an empty plate, but never seeming to hover.   Our group split three salads and three pizzas (my favorites being the bet salad and wild mushroom pizza), and they split every salad beautifully so that each player looked like it was a full salad. Lunch for six plus a bottle of wine was around $110, pretty amazing for Vegas. I've never tried Wolfgang's pizzeria before definitely will for a satisfying, delicious meal with menu choices to please everyone in your party."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING! Phenomenal lobster special. Allison and Tony took great care of us! Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Tony is one of the best servers I've ever had. Very attentive and full of energy. He had great recommendations on food and drinks! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"So many choices in Vegas. Nice location inside the mall. The Bolognese Rigatoni was served incredibly hot and fresh. High quality Italian food moderately priced for Vegas. Get 20% off your order when you check in with YELP!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I definitely try to come to Wolfgang Puck! Their linguine with clam is soooo good. One of my favorites! On my last visit, my friend ordered the veal ravioli and omg that was so good too! I must get that next time I come. I had another friend who ordered the rigatoncini and that was delicious and flavorful as well. YUM"}
{"text":"I'm honestly perplexed as to why this place has 4 stars.  We came on a Sunday night at 730; the place was half empty which apparently means you get half the service and quality of food: -Waited 10 mins to get greeted and seated (had a reservation) -Wine and water glasses smelled like dirty dish soap -Noticed another table had bread, had to ask FOUR times before it was finally brought out - after our entrees arrived  -Both pastas - ravioli and carbonara - were basic and just barely edible -We saw our waitress maybe twice the entire meal I'd expect this quality of food/service at Olive Garden, but not for these prices or with this name attached. There are plenty of other great Vegas restaurants - try one of those."}
{"text":"Fun place, great food, drink menu, and dessert! The atmosphere is open and fun! The waiter was very polite and the manager helped us out as well! Overall a good experience for us!"}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and the pizza was divine! We would constantly stop by this section of the Aria (where we stayed for the week) to grab a bite to eat! So convenient and quick!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible. We were seated at a private table behind a wall divider... I think they forgot about us.. Took 15-20 minutes to receive our drink order. We even made a comment to the manager but no change. Overall food was good though! Great meatballs and anti pasta salad! We split a pasta but I don't recall which one. I think we may have come on an off night based on the other good reviews."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the complaints about service here are about. We came in for dinner at 7:30 on a Friday night and the wait staff was VERY friendly and helpful. It was almost over the top (but not), they were checking on is so much. We both had the chicken parm, which isn't actually on the menu but had read about it in a review. It was excellent. All around great experience"}
{"text":"Food was not what I would expect from Wolfgang Puck.  There are too many options in Vegas, especially at this price.  Some tasty food and some not so much."}
{"text":"My husband and I just returned from our Wedding weekend at the Aria and this was my favorite meal. It wasn't the fanciest ( we had dinner at Jean George and Social House), but it was the best.  We ate a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. I wish that I could remember our servers name, because she deserves special recognition. She was super friendly and welcoming, quick with gray recommendations and always checking on us to make sure that we were happy. She was great!  We each had a pizza. I customized a basic pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and olives. It was fantastic! I ate every bite.   We saw a foursquare tip to order White Sangria. We had a pitcher and it was amazing. Even if you don't plan on eating here, go to the bar and have the Sangria, trust me.   My husband ordered the cookie selection for dessert and loved them so much, that we bought more to take home to California. They were the best ginger snaps that he had ever eaten.  Our server even gave me an extra glass of iced tea in a to-go cup.  Great service, great food and nice vibe. I look forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck just might be my favorite chef of all time, or at least top 3 for sure.  Thankfully a city like Vegas has many of his restaurants.  Most palates nowadays are numbed down by basic ingredients that only appeal to fatty flavors.  Nothing wrong with that but it takes a true chef to bring together flavors and sauces to make a mouth of happy.  Enter Wolfgang.  This restaurant has only been open for around 2 years.  It is a great option to still have some of Wolfgang Puck's meals without the super expensive price tag.  The meats are fresh and flavorful as are the pasta's.  His Cesar salad is made with blue cheese and was one of my favorites.  You can get a pitcher of sangria for around $20."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing,  we had the aged filet mignon with broccoli rabe with the silk potatoes caesar salad with fresh anchovies and a fresh crab cake patty. This meal was probably the best I've ever had, the bill was a little over 200 but worth every penny I really hate that I didn't take any pics but the lights were very dim and the service was great. We even enjoyed the  Parmesan crostini and the different breads they offered before our meal witch was brought out in courses. This place is a must try oh yeah we were at The Venetian Hotel Casino not MGM"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Everything from the octopus salad to the pizza and eggplant parm were out of this world! Great prices. Great music. Great service!! A must go!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner the evening of my birthday, because of it's close proximity to Aria, and gorgeous location inside Crystals.   We started with drinks. My BFF got the agave julep which was fresh and tasty, but very sweet. I got the Drunken Pumpkin which was delicious, very flavorful, and not overly sweet. My BF and his BFF ordered a pitcher of beer. After about 10 minutes of the girls having their drinks and the guys waiting, a half pitcher came out because they ran out. They ordered another type of beer, and waited another fifteen minutes for that to come out.   For appetizers, my fatty BFF got the soup appetizer, which was good, but not $12 good. My BF and I shared the insalada mista ($9) with cherry tomatoes and shaved Parmesan, which was good but not extraordinary. They split it for us though, which was nice. The complimentary breads, especially the sourdough, were remarkable. I am a huge sourdough fan, and they sure did it right! It was fluffy and flavorful, and I would have been happy just eating that all night. :)   Our group loves food, so we all at least try, if not share, each others' meal. Our orders, orderers, and ratings:  - Eggplant Parmesan (BFF) (*****)  - Mushroom Pizza (BF's BFF) (****)  - Italian Meat Pizza (BF) (***)  - Swordfish Entree (Bday girl) (**)   My favorites dishes were the eggplant Parmesan and the mushroom pizza. The eggplant was lightly battered and fried, almost tempura-like, and not covered in sauce, but accented with sauce. There was such delicious flavor from the vegetable! The mushroom pizza was really flavorful, and the mushrooms went really well with the combo of sauces and cheese.   The other dishes, the Italian meat pizza and swordfish, were less impressive. Salami sounded good on pizza... turns out it's kind of a weird combination. They were also stingy with the sweet peppers which seemed to be the main source of flavor. I may just stick to pepperonis on my pizza next time. I would advise against the swordfish entree because it was somewhat fishy and a very small portion for $34.   The restaurant shared a complimentary dessert for my birthday, and I chose the tiramisu. It was light and tasty, and had little malt balls mixed in, which was unusual for tiramisu. I, of course, shared it with my best friends and they enjoyed it as well.   Service was good. Not our main waiter, but the back-up waiter (or whatever that title would be) was very helpful, efficient, and attentive. The regular waiter was not bad, but not wonderful.   I would come back here because the ambiance is very unique, the decor is beautiful, and the food was good. It was pricey, but we had a nice dinner together making it worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This place drives me crazy. They disguise their 7 for 7 happy hour as a deal, but in reality it's a huge rip off. If they displayed their 7 \"deals\" and people had the option to see what they were ordering prior to putting it in, I can't imagine anyone in their right mind would choose anything from the menu. Their portions are beyond tiny, they are micro. A $40 bill and left still hungry. Save your money and the frustration. The quality of food is above average, but I need more than a spoon full."}
{"text":"Another boring celebrity chef in an overpriced Vegas restaurant.  I had lunch here with a large group.  The service was okay, not spectacular.  I had the porchetta panini with fries.  It was good, just not great.  And the fries were NOT homemade, really, Woflgang?  You can't invest in some tools to make real fries?"}
{"text":"Tony was duh-best. All his suggestions were EXCELLENT from the main course to desert."}
{"text":"A really great eating experience.  I had ate in other of his restaurants and wasnt expecting the meal that I received.  One of the best Cesar Salads I have every had, dressed perfectly, crispy salad and yummy anchovies.   I also had a great mushroom pizza which was spot on.  Really great food for a reasonable price!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came with our bride before heading out to the club. Our bride to be was served an treated the best! Shout out to our server Apollo and his helper Adrian. Very tentative to meet in our needs. We were in a hurry so Apollo hooked it up in the kitchen and expedited our order. The margahretti pizza was delicious and we shared a cesar salad which they split in to two for us. The ladies enjoyed the service the atmosphere and attention we got. Will def return on a next visit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We had the prosciutto pizza, bolognese pasta, bruschetta, and tiramisu. Nothing disappointed. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is definitly a semi-hidden Vegas gem. Easy to get in to with a cool vibe and great food. Our group had several of the pizzas and pasta dishes. Everyone shared and in the end we had a hard time agreeing on which was best. I also love that they take on line reservations. A big plus in a busy market like Vegas."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch this past Friday afternoon with three other dining companions.  After a long night out we were looking for some pizza and this place hit the spot.  While I personally did not order a drink, two of my companions ordered the bloody Mary which one said was the best that he had ever had.  For my entree I decided upon the spicy pepperoni pizza.  I was also lucky enough to try both the Italian and the eggplant pizzas.  All were good but I really loved the combination of ricotta, pepperoni and spicy peppers that were on the spicy pepperoni.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  All of the pizzas were tasty but be prepared to pay over $15 for a 9 inch pie."}
{"text":"Many Italian restaurants in New York, we went to. This Vegas one and we were delighted. Try it and enjoy.. Jay"}
{"text":"In the mall upstairs overlooking Starbucks. This Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina is located inside the Crystals shopping center on the 2nd floor. The food is OK. You have so many better options in Vegas. They offer signature pizzas, sandwiches & other light fare. The menu has changed and now it's no better then your average papa murphy pizza at a $$$$$ price.  Wolfgang Puck is a ripoff!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I was looking for a bite to eat, desiring something quick that's not a burger.  Hopped up to the bar and enjoyed a mushroom pizza with braised leeks, fontina, and teleggio. Super tasty! At $16, it was plenty for me and my SO.  They also have a great happy hour menu with drinks for $4 and appetizers under $10. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Along with Firefly, this is another of my favorite places for the business traveler looking for a comfortable place to dine alone.  I've gone in a few times for salads, appetizers, pizza, and cocktails from the $7 happy hour menu.  Everything I've tried so far has been great.   The ice cream assortment was great - fresh mango, pear, and other yummy  flavors - but the vanilla is absolutely to die for.  The servers and bartenders are knowledgeable and really friendly.  Nice ambiance, even the bathroom is beautiful.   I'll be going back.  update 1/5/11 - Went back for a business meal.  Was fabulous.  I had the swordfish, my colleague had gnocchi.  Will W. is an outstanding server, very professional, and I got more of that vanilla gelato.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine italienne. Saveurs au rendez-vous. Pas de sucres ajouté. Pâtes et pizze comme à la maison. Pinot noir maison excellent. Ravis!"}
{"text":"So I tried two entrees here during the three trips, since my friends are fans of this particular WP joint.   The Margherita pizza during dinner time was tasty, but didn't have anything differentiating about itself compared to Spinatos or Zachary's...it wasn't as \"good\" or \"original\" compared to those two. The cheese and the grease gave me a slight stomach ache.   The butter lettuce with the Gorgonzola cheese and bacon was phenomenal, however!   For lunch, the starters: Steamed Mussels and the bruschetta are worth a try. Those steamed mussels are pretty tasty; almost comes close to the italians seafood I've enjoyed in Boston."}
{"text":"the pizza is just ok. service is a bit slow.  service was weird everyone helps everybody - so you dont get a dedicated server they are all just running around trying to do everything which ends up being nothing."}
{"text":"Great location, excellent service! Reasonably priced, too! The linguine pasta and the prosciutto pizza were a little bit salty, and the spicy pepperoni pizza lacked a bit of spice. Still a great meal though!"}
{"text":"We brought our 3 year old daughter and 1 year old son with us and our server Tony was great with them!  Great food also.  We would come back"}
{"text":"We finally made it to a Puck branded restaurant and, overall, this was a very good and enjoyable meal.  We started with a Caprese \"salad\" which had a nice array of different tomatoes, but it was woefully lacking in fresh basil. It also included a decent portion of cheese, but they don't use fresh mozarella. I'm not clear what it was, but if definitely was NOT mozarella.  My wife ordered the Veal Scallopini which was very good. The melted mozarella over the veal was a nice touch. But it was just the entree, with a decent portion of mushrooms topping it. A bit of polenta, or perhaps steamed broccoli would have seemed fitting for the price.  I was lured into trying an off menu special consisting of a 12oz boneless ribeye with sauteed brussels sprouts and pearl onions. It was a VERY good meal. The steak was precisely medium rare, as ordered, and the flavor and texture was spot on.  Only few small knocks...   First, they should clarify and then be consistent with \"Sunday Supper\" being available for parties of four or more. The menu says no such thing. We learned upon by inquiring and didn't press the issue. A couple who arrived a few minutes later, and was seated across from us made the same inquiry and received the same response. However, seconds later the waiter (same as ours) said \"let me see what I can do\". A few moments later he emerged from the kitchen with news that since the kitchen was super busy they would go ahead and serve them the \"Sunday Supper\". WTH??? You made no such offer or effort for us Dave.  Second, its offseason in Las Vegas at the moment, but their website STRONGLY suggests reservations be made at least 48 hours in advance. We had no difficulty getting a same day reservation and the place wasn't even close to packed. It barely qualified as busy.  Finally, this is not really a knock against Cucina as it is against The Shops at Crystals. We're not wealthy, nor are we dirt poor. We're just plain, solid, working class souls. We dress, carry and conduct ourselves very well. Yet we were repeatedly snubbed and refused service or attention at all but one of the stores where we stopped to admire their wares. The shops are all super high end, and clearly intended for the upper class elite - but that doesn't excuse snubbing us. We felt just like Julia Robert's character in Pretty Woman. We were judged without knowing us. And, truth be told, we could have easily dropped many thousands of dollars in one or more shops that night - had we been welcome."}
{"text":"actual rating review: 3.5 Stars  I been going to Las Vegas for a long time. The entire time I have wanted Spago to be my first Wolfgang Puck eatery experience. But due to time constraints during my recent trip, we settled on Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina, located inside the Crystal Shops.  My friends and I ate here over Super Bowl weekend for lunch. We were quite surprised that there was no wait to be seated. We were promptly seated and introduced to our waiter. We ordered the following:  (2) orders of the Rigatoncini Piemontese Meat sauce, Garlic & Parmesan Reggiano.     The piemontese meat sauce (italian beef cut) was a nice change from the usual rigatoni w/ meat sauce I have had in years past. I thought the portion size was a little small considering its price point and there was no main protein present. This dish was decent, but not mindblowing; it lacked a gamechanging flavor punch.  (1) order of the Spaghetti, tomatoes, basil, garlic with house made meatballs. homemade meatballs? COUNT ME IN. These meatballs are the best meatballs I have ever had. Spaghetti cooked al dente. Now this is a dish I would come to WPP& C for!  Service was excellent and the food was yummy. Get the spaghetti meatballs, forego the Rigatoncini Piemontese."}
{"text":"Overpriced but what isn't in Las Vegas?  The restaurant is clean, elegant, quiet, and a bit secluded from the hustle and bustle of the strip despite being on it.    we went for a light lunch and had the margarita pizza. I love a good margarita pie and I enjoyed it but for my husband, it was just cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Food is decent and well-priced. I think they are understaffed since we have had an absentee waitperson for the last 45 minutes once they got busy. Cocktails are good and the pasta was delicious. Pizza is fine - not the best and not the worst. We'd probably come again, but might sit at the bar itself to get more attentive service."}
{"text":"Really great experience here, my husband and I both really enjoyed it! Great service and a fun ambience in the crystals shopping centre. The food for me was almost five stars - the only reason why I didn't give this review five stars was that I really didn't like the antipasto salad that came out with our mains - that was a really disappointment. The bruschetta was amazing, beautiful pesto & balsamic flavours - just stunning! I ordered the veal ravioli and it was beautiful - the sauce was amazing with the mushrooms, it was a great order. My husband had the ox tail Ragu - also really yummy. We had a great night and a very positive experience here - definitely try it out!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review of a restaurant \"chain\" but I'm going to make an exception for this Puck location. The pizza crust here is probably the best I have ever tasted. It's a very thin crust made from a sourdough base. Outstanding! My partner and I also sampled two different salads during lunch and loved both of them. The service was top notch and prices aren't that bad for a \"Strip\" location. It is located on the 2nd level Crystals. They offer an all day happy hour that features some drink and app specials. The restroom setup is a bit unorthodox."}
{"text":"I would trade my first child for some good polenta and here my first child would have to be given up to Wolfgang Puck. We came here on our last trip to Las Vegas and were very pleased. Probably one of of the least expensive places to dine in Crystals (which still will set you back $25-$30 a plate) and it also has a nice view to people watch while you dine. We made reservations before going and were quickly seated. The server was friendly but forgettable. I didn't partake in any spirits but my iced tea was very good. Everything on the menu looked splendid but I ended up settling on the Veal Scallopini, Mushrooms, Artichokes, and Parmesan. Since this dish had very little carbohydrates and my fat stores needed further fuel I decided to order their creamy polenta with Parmesan reggiano. Yum Yum. The veal was very good but not the best I have ever had. Cooked perfectly though. I had to steal some bites from my fellow diners and the sea bass and lamb were some of the best I have ever tasted. No room for dessert. Probably one of the better meals I had in Las Vegas but not quite enough for that coveted 5 stars. If you can't afford anything in Crystals you can at least eat here and pretend you are rich."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I've dined at my fair share of restaurants, some high end and also bar fare included. Cucina far exceeded my expectations in every way. The staff were all friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome. When it came to the menu prices were typical being a more upscale place and the location along the strip. The food itself was phenomenal and some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the ravioli and it was so delicate and delicious. The meatballs were also prefect and mouth watering with an amazing sauce, so good my friend wished she had ordered them herself.  Just thinking about it now makes me wish I could go back right now!"}
{"text":"This place was disappointing. The Service was excellent, but my pasta was extremely salty and I couldn't help thinking that although the others in my group enjoyed their meals,it wasn't good enough for the prices. They did give a complimentary dessert to apologize for the salty dish which i appreciated. Probably wont go back though.."}
{"text":"Just call it Wolfgang Suck.  We stopped here for dinner before the Zarkana show. We shared the bruschetta appetizer, the fiancé had the chicken piccata, I had the margherita pizza. I wish I had taken a picture of the pizza!!! It was a greasy cheese pizza with 3 slivers of basil on top. A boring greasy mess. The fiancé liked the piccata but found himself on the toilet within the hour. Ack!!  We drank water and ice tea. With the bill totaling nearly $70 I am super disappointed."}
{"text":"This was so good!! I was here on a Sunday evening, so it was pretty quiet. The staff here is very friendly,and the food was just superb. So glad Wolfgang Puck opened another restaurant here!"}
{"text":"The Jidori Brick Chicken sounded really good but it came out dry. The chicken didn't seem freshly made and the skin on top was like a sheet of rubber. I've cooked chicken and froze and reheated chicken before and it never comes out this dry. How do you make a leg of all things dry? My waiter did check on us and I informed him about the chicken being dry but that was that. I do have to say the mushrooms and corn under the chicken were outstanding, I did enjoy them. The potatoes tasted like box potatoes but might have been fresh?  My husband had the veal osso bucco and he said the veal was dry and disappointing but the gnocchi were good and light.  I don't know if they were having a bad day or if they are like this all the time. My husband was here before and thought the wild boar ragout was really good here before but the waiter talked him into trying the osso bucco that was dry.  Wolfgang needs to spend less time on the shopping channel and more time in his restaurants."}
{"text":"Cucina was our first dinner when getting to Las Vegas and we couldn't be more pleased with our choice!! We were pleasantly greeted by Tony, our server, who provided not only a delicious meal, but entertainment as well! He answered all of our questions and made our night very special - we were celebrating a bachelorette.  I had the New York strip, which was AMAZING. Others tried the pappardelle (Tony's favorite) and the sea bass.  All excellent choices!! Don't forget about the garlic bread. Agh the garlic bread. And the zeppoles. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, decided to sit at the bar and watch games.   Our server/ bartender was very friendly, introduced us happy hour menu, regular menu, and drink menu, said the happy hour menu was good, small but very good. the regular menu and specialty cocktail menu looked very nice too.   I ordered braised baby artichoke, white sangria and passion fruit Cosmo from happy hour menu, and Steamed Mussels, Chorizo, Marjoram, Grilled Ciabatta from regular menu, bf ordered soup of the day and Linguine, Steamed Clams, White Wine-Garlic Sauce, they offer complimentary bread too.   I liked my food a lot, they were very delicious and flavored, the sausages in my steamed mussels are particularly good,  just one problem, they were very very salty! Glad we were a little hangover, so we could finish the extremely salty dishes there.   I wouldn't go there for dinner, just a casual lunch after a little bit too much drinking the previous night. the portions are so big, even good for sharing. the price is not cheap, our tab was around $78. A little more for a casual lunch , but its Vegas and its at Crystals. SO... :P"}
{"text":"Certainly one of my favorite restaurants on the strip! (And it won't break the bank!)  The service was awesome. I'm not sure of my server's name but he was a nice guy who was very attentive and really kind. I was surprised not to see him blow up after trying to handle a major language barrier while trying to take a drink order. I would've lost it and gave up, but he was nice enough to work with the party next to our table.  I came in with my girl and her sister to enjoy a nice dinner so we stopped here because Wolfgang's restaurants are always consistent. We started with the bruschetta, fried rice balls, and calamari. They were all amazing. Calamari was perfect and tasted fantastic. The pesto bruschetta was one of the best I've ever had and the fried rice balls were out of control delicious. Outstanding flavor in such a small ball.    We also ordered a mushroom pizza, just because i was so eager to try it. It was amazing. Great mushrooms and the pizza was done perfectly! We each had a slice and took the rest home. Moving further, I ordered the beef lasagne, my girl ordered the SeaBass (substituted for something different) and our third ordered the Veal lasagna. All were great, although my girlfriend was little disappointed that the menu description didn't include olives or the tomato sauce that was under the description of her entree. She's not a fan of either. She said the fish was just OK. But was pretty much already stuffed from the appetizers.  Shockingly, we found room for dessert and ordered the fresh Strawberry cake thing? and the tiramisu. I'm not a fan of fruit in my desserts but I was told it was delicious and the tiramisu was amazing. The light crunch in the tiramisu was unlike anything I've ever tried and really closed the meal out great for me.  Overall, I know I'll be back. This restaurant is one of the best Wolfgang Pucks in town and certainly the best option inside of Crystals shopping center. (Unless you want to spend $75/person at Mastro's)"}
{"text":"Awesome meals and the chocolate gelato tastes like Abuelita hot chocolate. (YUM!) Our waiter, Tony, was amazing! He was able to accommodate a picky palate."}
{"text":"Having spent a week in Vegas with kids, this was the BEST restaurant we visited...and we ate out 2-3 times a day.  Great service, outstanding food (we raved about EVERY dish), kids loved splitting the linguini and clams. Fantastic location, ambiance, access to sports in the bar.  Reasonably priced as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!! The best meal we ate in Vegas!! My baby has severe/anaphylactic allergies to eggs and peanuts and they went above and beyond in feeding him a SAFE meal. He gobbled up his kids pizza. The wine, Amura Malbec, was delicious. Went perfectly with our caprese salad and pizza cippo (without meat, we had it with red onions instead). The caprese had delicious flavor and the tomatoes were perfect with the mozzarella cheese. Very very fresh and refreshing after being outside. The pizza had a perfectly cooked crispy crust. Very thin and cooked just right.   The service was amazing!!! Apollo was incredible, everyone was super attentive and amazing! I wish I knew all of their names to say thank you. The restaurant is also impeccably clean.   If I come back to Vegas, I will visit again. You will not be disappointed! Visit this restaurant if you want a really yummy meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Really great food. High quality pasta. Defiantly come here again. You get a nice view of the mall below."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience! Needed a place where I could sit down and have a reasonably priced meal close to my company apartment. (When I'm in Vegas for work I'm looking for efficiency over entertainment or a \"dining experience.\") Staff was all very professional and the food was really fantastic. I got the arugula salad and it was one of the most delicious salads I've ever had with peas, radishes, burrata, some other goodies, and a lemon vinegarette. The dessert (pistachio bundito) was pretty good. The cocktail (old fashion) was average. The prices were on par with Vegas, I didn't think anything was outrageous at all. The quality of the food and the flavors are of course what Wolfgang is known for, and I was not disappointed. I'll be back when I'm on business!"}
{"text":"Our group went to Cucina Wolfgang Pack. We were served by Tony. His recommendations for our entrees and wine select were in point. Very well verse in all their good selections! Tony your Da BOMB!!! Thank you for your 5-star service! Aloha from Hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate there this past weekend on a girls Vegas trip. The service was good, made a reservation on Open Table with no problem, and the rescheduled us when we were running late. The restaurant is in a great location and doesn't get too packed which is nice. As for the food, it was very well presented and was very tasty. Not too big portions also! So over-all good experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent is all I have to say. We had nearly half the appetizers on the menu and a variety of dishes and everything was excellent. I mean really excellent quality food and my mom is from Italy and is the biggest food snob and had fish and cleaned her plate. The veggies were delicious and fresh. Our server was top notch! Even the busboys (is that the proper name?)...we had a water spill and before I could say anything he cleaned it and brought a hot water pitcher so we wouldn't have any spills. It was a more than pleasant experience considering it was a last minute decision. The pizza...exquisite and the fish...absolutely fresh and tasteful... I can't believe how great our experience was. Must go here!"}
{"text":"Located in the Crystal Shopping Mall, Wolfgang Puck's Cucina is a good restaurant for quick eats at affordable prices.  I came here on a Friday and had the Lobster special which included a (thin) half lobster and a sizable lobster mac and cheese. Since bread is not complimentary I also ordered a side of garlic bread.  Everything tasted as good as it looked.   Overall the meal was good and the service was satisfactory. I recommend."}
{"text":"Just returned home from a visit to Las Vegas. My friend and I happened upon Cucina and had an amazing experience. Nick was an extremely happy and attentive waitperson. We had two of the happy hour drink specials and some appetizers. Incredible drinks, classy atmosphere and the food is fabulous! This restaurant has happy hour all day long and each item was no more than $8! We couldn't get enough so we went back the next day for more. Nick was there again with another server Matt. Great service, upscale drinks and beautifully presented food. Next time we're in town, we'll be back for more at Cucina!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite all-around strip restaurant in Las Vegas.   The caprese salad ranks amongst the best caprese salads I've ever had. The margherita pie is a goddamned wok of art. I'm a sauce guy and this tasty, slightly sweet sauce hits the mark perfectly.  Pizzeria & Cucina has a light, open air atmosphere and prices so reasonable that you may forget that you're in one of the most expensive shopping malls in America.  Protip: Happy hour is all day at the bar. The $16 pitcher of sangria you get with this deal is delicious and more than enough booze to get two people nicely drunk."}
{"text":"Has the braised veal osso buco. Awesome. Prices fairly priced. Recommend."}
{"text":"Yas this place is pretty empty but the food was really food. We went during HH and got the $6 pizzas, $6 wings and $6 calamari. It was all really good and hit the spot. The calamari was fried perfectly and it was really big pieces. The pizza came out piping hot and with gooey cheese. I also had the $6 red sangria that was delicious! The service was great and fast, we sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This is a regular for us when we want simple, Italian food without a lot of fuss.  They have a great selection of pastas and pizzas in a very bright, clean open air restaurant in the Crystals Mall.  There are lots of Italian places in Vegas but many of the ones off strip are old school, dark, and a bit over the top.  We love the food at Wolfgang's. The starters are all fantastic, love the carbonara, and the arugula pizza."}
{"text":"Really great pizza, and the red sangria was yummy.... me and my husband ate there for lunch and we going back on our last day here before heading back home it was so good"}
{"text":"I am not one to complain about money when it comes to dining. I think I work so that I can eat at nice places and yelp about it. The sad part is, I wasn't kidding. Hey, we all have our priorities! My deck at home could flake off but my tummy is always happy.  However, Vegas and food are ridiculous. I just dropped $18 on a sad breakfast sandwich and a coffee. It's insane. It should have been just $8! So, last night's dinner at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina was a real treat as I didn't have to worry about the check.  My company took me and my colleagues for a very nice dinner at a private room here. It was so much fun as we have worked all day on Sunday and it was fun to see everyone at one place. Beer, wine, and cocktails were flowing and before we knew it, we were laughing and having a blast over heirloom bruschetta, calamari, and meatballs. All were tasty.  After that, we had a pasta course of bucatini with wild boar ragu that was to die for. It was  really delicious mix of thick savory tomato and jus mixed of a sauce with shreds of tender wild boar, kale, and hand rolled pasta. Yumm!  Though I was getting full, I still enjoyed the flat iron steak with potato and broccolini. The flat iron steak was surprisingly tender with great flavor on the meat. There was a salmon selection that looked good as well but I think I made the right choice.  Dessert was also surprisingly deeelicious!! It was an individual pie with peach filling with almond paste served warm with ice cream. That was a perfect combo for me. I don't believe I have ever loved a man more than I love a great warm pie. Well for one thing, the pie never argues with me. That's a big plus.  The room we were in was very nice and spacious enough to house all of us. There were over 30 people and it was just fine. The service was also impeccable. It was well done.  I am lucky that I work for a great company and my coworkers are just really awesome people. I really had a blast over Moscow Mule and Hefeweizen. Plus, no check to swipe a credit card for. Yay! I could make up some of the other meals since I saved tonight! Yeah, life of a per diem traveling worker! However, can't complain really.. Not tonight because yes, I am working but I am working in Vegas!!! Whoohoo!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was very enjoyable. We came on a Monday night and made a reservation and got sat easily. The food was great. I had parsnip tortelino. The waiter warned me it wasn't a large plate, however it was just what I was looking for. All of the ingredients flowed well together. I believe it had a sage brown butter sauce. We ordered a pitcher sangria. It was affordable prices for around $24 and we each got about three glasses. Good choice for a nice dinner but I wished it was a little more romantic. I should have considered that it is located in the crystals shopping center."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this place. I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and the service was phenomenal! I made a reservation through open seats, but at 6:30 on a Friday night, it was surprisingly not busy, so reservations weren't necessary. I ordered the brick chicken. It was full of flavor and very tender. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana. He thought the chicken itself lacked flavor, but paired with the spaghetti, was just right. We ordered the zepole for dessert and it is served with white chocolate and raspberry sauce. It was amazing, and the best part is they didn't charge us for it because it was my boyfriend's birthday! The servers kept the bread stocked and the drinks filled. It was an overall great experience."}
{"text":"My group and I were left completely unimpressed by this place. Speaking for myself, I was expecting more since this place has \"Wolfgang Puck\" as a prefix in it's name.   The server was nice, although I forgot her name. The food took for-ev-errrrrrr to get out to us. The eggplant parmesan (my dish) was a-ok. My cousin had the mushroom pizza, which was OK, as well. I am a huge fan of arugula and when her pizza came out, the mushroom was baked within the pizza as it usually is, and the arugula was just sprinkled on top with what looked like olive oil sprinkled over it. She wasn't happy. I think she was expecting it to be baked with the whole pizza, but whatever. I ate it all anyway. Another one of my friends ordered a pepperoni pizza sub pepperoni for chicken, because they don't pork. The server was kind enough to do that, however failed to tell her that there would be an extra charge for chicken. One would think since you're subbing the item, it would be an equal exchange if you weren't notified of a price difference. We didn't want to complain or argue, so we just paid the difference and left it at that.  Everyone left the restaurant unhappy and with complaints. Bad sign. We probably won't come here again next time."}
{"text":"Really good food, get the chef's plate, great combination platter.  The service is very nice too!"}
{"text":"I had no idea Wolfgang Puck was so upscale! The only Wolfgang Puck I had ever eaten at was in Macy's food court. I have to say I'm quite impressed.  We told them we had a show to catch, so they were extra quick with service.   My mojito was yum. The bread was tasty. My favorite was the one with raisins. My pizza was huge! I had to give my bf some.  I probably won't seek out this place next time, but I know I don't mind coming back."}
{"text":"O.M.G.!  I went out on a limb and ordered the pork steak and it did NOT disappoint!!  Tender & delicious!  The service from Juan was impeccable.  This is a destination from now on!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual dinner spot for our first night in Las Vegas. The menu at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina appealed to everyone in our party. The food did not disappoint. I had the caramelized onion, guanciale, and goat cheese pizza. The crust was light and chewy, the toppings were delicious. Husband was very happy with his Italian meat pizza. Other entrees enjoyed were the eggplant parmesan and linguine with steamed clams. Service was excellent. And the people watching opportunities were fantastic."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  The restaurant is located smack in the center of the premium shopping center, Crystal's. That being said, the prices are surprisingly reasonable, or so I thought before I ordered food.   Service is great; friendly staff who deal with tourists every single day, and are still able to serve you with a smile.    Now on to the 'edibles'.  Ack, what a disappointment.  I ordered a citrus tea to drink, which was supposed to be an iced tea flavoured with a mint syrup. I might as well have ordered an Arizona iced tea. It was overbearingly sweet and tasted like store bought bottled tea. Why would a chef put his name on this stuff?  To eat I ordered the baby artichokes. These were quite fine. Tender, well seasoned, and refreshing as a antipasto.   For my main I ordered a prosciutto pizza, thinking it would be the smart thing to order at a pizzeria. The prosciutto was of great quality, sliced very thinly and was very fresh. The rest of it was horrible. The dough was flat, dense and chewy. It clearly was pre-rolled and refrigerated. The cheese was quite off-putting, it was coagulated in all the wrong places  and full of little holes; bland and flavorless.   It was quite a shocking pizza, as a fellow yelper commented, dominos would make better pizza. I don't understand what the massive kitchen is used for, but there is clearly no fresh dough being kneaded and no wood-oven in it either. Thankfully the bartender took the pizza off the bill when I questioned whether the pizza had been made that day.   I would not recommend this to anyone, except maybe for a cocktail as it has a nice view and a kickass decor. For 20$ a pizza, it is not a good value at all, which is saying a lot as that is quite cheap for Vegas.   I would not recommend this to anyone, except maybe for a cocktail as it has a nice view and a kickass decor."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to 'shrooms, and Wolfgang Puck kindly catered to my addiction by offering the most brilliant flatbread pizza I've had the pleasure of chewing. These mushrooms lacked all of that woodsy-dirt flavor usually accompanying my bad habit.  The buttery umami mushrooms were adorned with slightly bitter, yet still crisp, dark green arugula leaves, which rested atop a gossamer glaze of béchamel and shiny fontana cheese. Lightly salted, when dunked in a sweet side of red sauce, you're mouth is in for the most psychedelic flavor trip of its life."}
{"text":"We had dinner on 11/9/14.  No wait for a table.  Great ambiance in what I consider one of the coolest buildings/malls in the country.  Take special note to the wooden stair cases throughout Crystals.  Absolutely stunning carpentry, sky lights and walls/lines and floors.  Anyhow, after we were seated, with not a full house, it took an unusually long amount of time for our assigned wait person to arrive and intro himself.  Anyhow, we split the kale salad, which as fantastic.  We got a Margarita pizza and a rigatoncini.  Both were quite good, although we felt the pizza wasn't anything to write home about where the other was really good.  It took a long time for a glass of wine and pineapple mojito to arrive.  We had to ask for table bread too.  We asked what the WP label was - meaning what label is it that WP puts his sticker over.  No one in the restaurant could answer the question. That seemed a bit weird."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to cucina but we've been to crystals at the city center several times. It's very nice and modern. I had the raviolis and my wife had the prosciutto pizza. We shared and both meals were very good. If you have time go to a tux 4 tonight stand and get the 25% off your bill voucher. It only cost $2 to save 25%. It's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Accidents happen. Management apologized. Refunded our meal and gave us a gift-card for a future meal. We appreciated everything and feel that this was a fair response from management. More then anything we hope it was a learning experience. Besides the allergic reaction, the service and staff were all great."}
{"text":"As with most Wolfgang Puck restaurant they serve great bread , as they do here. We started with Butter Lettuce salad, it came with Gorgonzola, bacon , pistachio and egg. The dressing was just OK. We then had a Italian Meat Pizza, which came with Pepperoni, Salami, Sopresatta and sweet peppers. The crust was the star. Service was average I couldn't get my drink refill all meal. Great location upstairs at Crystals shopping center."}
{"text":"Excellent pepperoni pizza and bolognese pasta. Staying at the Signature at MGM and the restaurant is a short walk away. Would go again!!"}
{"text":"Slow service,  average food.  In fact, I had a 100% better Cesar salad at pub in Seattle. Lame. The restaurant itself is nice and the bar area looked pretty lively."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant inside the even more beautiful Crystals, without the high prices.   First off, the service here was very impressive. For a party of over 20, service went smoothly from the the taking of our orders to the splitting of the checks and everything in between.   In addition to the service, the food here was wonderful. The server brought out two types of bread- Ciabatta and a fluffier, more rustic bread that everyone seemed to prefer. We asked for more of the good stuff, but the server noted that they were all out since it was close to the end of the night. Bummer!   No need to pout, however, as our food arrived just in time. I ordered the Steamed Mussels- 15 or so mussels from New Zealand steamed in a delicious white wine/tomato sauce with diced chorizo, garlic, and marjoram (herb), served with a grilled ciabatta slice lovingly brushed with olive oil. The mussels came out bubbling in a cast iron pan, remaining warm till the very last mollusk. The only hiccup of this dish was that two of the mussels weren't open. Other than that, I enjoyed this dish and thought it perfect as an entree.   I also tried a bite of the Sea Bass dish, which was delicious. The skin of the bass was pan seared beautifully, resulting in a crispy skin that was good and contrasted nicely with the meat of the sea bass, which was so tender and melt in your mouth. Adding to the delicateness of the fish was the cream sauce that lay on top. I also tried the Italian Sausage Pizza- Rapini (Broccoli Rabe), Carmelized Garlic, Sausage, Mozzarella Cheese and Pecorino Romano atop a thin, soft pizza dough- which was flavorful and delicious.   One of my favorite parts of the meal was how the checks were split. Each check had 5/6 people's orders, and each order's total (including tax and tip) was separate from the other totals. This made paying very easy and hassle-free. I didn't have to do any calculations, except counting the money for our table.   Can't wait to try out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service provided by Quetzi. Stopped by here with the family for dinner. Personally ordered sea bass and the mates ordered spaghetti. On top of everything went into a food coma. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Went here for a moderately priced and easily accessible food joint with my friend who works in the Crystals Mall. The last pizza place I went to owned by a celebrity chef sucked balls (SERIOUS PIE SEATTLE), so I was a little apprehensive when sitting down and looking over the menu.  HOWEVER  We ended up ordering the Prosciutto, Smoked Chorizo, and Italian Meat pizzas. Each were unique - herby - meaty - awesome. By far, the Prosciutto was the best, but I would order any of these pizzas again. As for pricing, it was fair and we all ended up spending around $12ish.   Ambiance was also really nice. Actually, upon reconsideration, all new Vegas restaurants have to look good or else it wouldn't be Vegas.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're in the Crystals mall and looking for good food."}
{"text":"Dinner over Memorial Day weekend with my family of four.   Short story, the dinner was pretty good.  We started with some salumi and cheese, served with olives and chutney.   Tasty stuff.  My son ordered the \"meatlovers' pizza and said it was good--nice crust.  My daughter had a half order of the carbonara which was kindly prepped without the zucchini.  She's not a huge eater but she polished it off.  I had the chicken piccata which was a huge serving over nicely cooked broccolini and my husband had the pork milanese (aka schnitzel) which was also huge, serviced with a really lovely arugula and fennel salad.  We shared the chocolate cremosa for dessert which was (frankly) just OK.  The teeny scoop of espresso gelato served with it was the star of the show.  It was the absolute essence of coffee, seriously.  This could have been a four-star meal; however, the service was jinky.  It took a while for the waiter to come by and see us after the hostess dropped us off.  He was nice but he didn't seem to know much about the menu.  I asked if the fritto misto was floured / battered and he was confused by my question and answered that it just \"came out of a bag.\"  Um, that's not what I asked and certainly not what I want to hear when dining at one of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants.  The restaurant is located in the Crystals shopping mall which felt cold and deserted at 730PM on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"What a fabulous evening and experience! Came here on my birthday-eve and was wowed from the moment we arrived. The staff here is amazing and very knowledgable. Adam, our server, was spectacular- hard to determine which was better - the delectable food or attentive server!   We started with the small meat and cheese board, which was the perfect amount for two to share. For our entrees we had the chicken piccata and the pappardelle. Both were delicious! We were treated to complimentary dessert (zeppole) in honor of my birthday. Oh my goodness were they yummy!!! Make sure you save room!!!  We will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Aria and went to Cucina twice. Loved the selection, the service and the specials. Their $25 three course lunches/$35 dinners are great. The staff was super friendly and accommodating with our toddler and ours friends' 5 year old. The kids menu is great and they even helped us clean up our utensils so we didn't have to carry a smelly bib with us all day  Bobbi Jo you rock. Thanks again"}
{"text":"Great place for some italian good.  The caramelized cauliflower was amazing and the pasta dish I had was delicious.  I think the bruschetta would be amazing if the balsamic was a reduction instead. Not that I'm Wolfgang or anything haha."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here.  The service is professional but not stuffy.  The prices were very reasonable considering the location and quality of food.  The bread came out piping hot, and was some of the softest fluffiest bread we've had. Sooooo good.   The beef carpaccio and tartare were superb and the salad of blanched spring vegetables was perfection simplified.  The only disappointment was the sausage pizza which was soggy and not all that great. The crust was pretty flavorless and would have greatly benefited from a little more time in a wood fired brick oven.  I'd definitely come back, but not for pizza."}
{"text":"We came here as a big multigenerational group for an early dinner. I have eaten at several Wolfgang restaurants before so was super excited to share with the big group. Not busy at all. All the dishes were delicious. We had the prie fix meal. Adults enjoyed several pitchers of sangria. Kids all ordered pizzas. However where cucina fell short was on serving size and service. Serving size was small on all shared dishes even for the salad. Dessert was laughable 2 tiny gelato balls for 5 adults ( the same size they brought out for table of two nearby). If not for the adults snagging some of the kids extra Pizza, and several extra desserts ordered for the kids, we would have left hungry.  The service was spotty, definitely not attentive or forward looking. No serving silverware for family style platters. Slow refills on water,  no refills on kids drinks. No clearing of dishes. We had several different servers  yet none really delivered and restaurant was not busy. Eggplant Parmesan was the fav but overall meal was below expectations. The kicker- did not honor yelp coupon because summer dinner special.  Loved the gender neutral bathroom! Loved the easy and free valet parking! Bummed the value and service were not to expectations."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  Food was mediocre.   Won't be back.   Service was great.  Atmosphere was a nice break from the loud, craziness of the strip.   We got the Calamari and vegetable appetizer combo.   Husband got the fettuccini noodles with seafood and I got the gluten free Capri pizza.   We also got the broccolini side dish.   The best tasting dish was the broccolini. Cooked perfect and flavorful.   The pizza was the worst I have ever had.   My husband wasn't impressed with his fettuccini dish or disappointed, it was just \"alright\".   Same opinion of the Calamari."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner/one day trip to Vegas with my wife. Didn't want to go too crazy expensive or with long waits and crowds. Cuccina was perfect. We shared the small salumi platter which was generous and delicious. Wife had the pappardelle and I had the sea bass. The pasta was fresh and delicious, and the sea bass came out like a Branzino and was well cooked and nicely seasoned with the vegetables. They gave me a free dessert which was greatly appreciated. And service was exceptional.   For a Wolfgang and Vegas restaurant, this is a bargain. Better than LA prices for the quality."}
{"text":"The linguine carbonara is one of the best dishes I've had in my life.  Thick, fresh made noodles....chunks of bacon....just rich, buttery pasta goodness.  We had excellent service and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food we received.  I loved it here."}
{"text":"Great experience! Went on a Wednesday night and had no wait.. our waiter, Tony was fantastic and knew the menu items very well!  Had half price off bottles of wine MTW & also used 20% off coupon  We got sausage pizza & meat pizza. Both great depending on type of meal you are looking for  Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Meh. This is elevated Mall food. Not anything special.  The prix fixe lunch is a good deal but I got the appetizer and main that had extra charges. The prosciutto was decent sized but the extra charge made it less of a value and the steak was medium when I asked for medium rare - very very medium, almost medium-well.  Both were disappointing given the extra I paid.   Best thing was the simple Greek yogurt dessert.   My other dining partners had the other pasta items. No one was wowed. Or even remotely satisfied. Let's just say no return visit is forthcoming.   Would be 2 stars but our waiter was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta. Children's cheesy pasta amazing to be sure. Be sure to have the sausage with onions and cherry peppers pizza.  It's the thinnest crust of your dreams!! Excellent service too.  Final note I was glad to see Wolfgang hadn't gone cheap on the kids crayons. He still used Crayolas.  :-)"}
{"text":"Both my wife and I LOVED this place. From the Kale salad to our main entrée it was a hit for us!!"}
{"text":"Had Salmon with asparagus and capers. Fresh fish, lovely preparation. Pizza was good too. No complaints!"}
{"text":"We had such a good time at Cucina. The food was great, and the staff was even better. Our waiter Tony was great, and so were the folks around him.   Not too crowded, reasonably priced, EXCELLENT food. Can't ask for much more.  The burrata/prosciutto/grilled bread was great, the chicken piccata was better than what I eat at home, and the little donut dessert really finished it off with a bang.  Seriously, we had a great time and will be back.   PS - Wednesday is half price bottles of wine. Lucky us."}
{"text":"This is located in the Crystal shopping center.  Not very busy so we got seated right away.  The food was very good - it is a 4.5 star.  The 1.5 star knocked off was the waiter service.  We had two kids and he never offered us a kids menu.  After we ordered, the food started to come, I asked the busboy if they have a kids menu and our waiter brought it over and say \"you wanted a kids menu?\" The menu was folded and gave it to us.  BTW out kids are 6 and 9, so it wasn't like we had big kids that kids menu doesn't apply.  The menu is super limited - even after I mentioned it, the waiter still didn't say anything.  After our food came, we overheard the table next to us, a different waiter was telling the customers 3 different specials that was not on the menu - 2 different types of steak and the Gnocchi specials - which was never mentioned to us when we were ordering.  It's a shame we never even had the opportunity to try the special - oh wait we didn't even get to hear it!  The restaurant was 20% occupied and the waiter never came and ask if everything is ok?  We have to wave the busboy for more water.  Correction - the waiter took our order, gave me the kids menu after I requested it and gave us our check.  Also, no dessert was offered at this Italian restaurant- at least no option was offered to us.  We felt discriminated!!  Absolutely a terrible experience.  We will never come back or any of the Wolfgang chains even though the food was decent - there are so many other options in Vegas.  This is when I don't agree with the 15% tips!"}
{"text":"Before heading home we had a great girls night dinner here. There were 8 of us and we sat in the \"centerpiece\" table. I had the veal ravioli which was delicious, with a side of brussel sprouts.  I tasted my friends' dishes - and they were all good, great portions.  Who would think, in the Crystals mall - the best mall food I've had. It wasn't crowded and great for groups. All our food came out together, and the staff keep our glasses filled."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the fettuccini and my wife had the ravioli. The ravioli was amazing!! The fettuccini was a little on the dry Side for my liking! They add a bread crumb to the fettuccini that makes it great! Also the portions are a little on the small side! Overall the service was great, crystal helped us!"}
{"text":"We came to Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina for a small meal before hitting the strip, it was 9 PM on a Friday night. We were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. Dave came shortly after we were seated and brought water and took our drink order. He recommended the Joseph James Wiseguy heiferweisner (?), a local beer which was really good! We ordered the starter prosciutto and the sausage pizza.   The prosciutto was so, soo good. It came quickly, the bread was warm and the mozzarella was cold. The dish had just a little salt, which really made the mozzarella delicious. The servers were quick to take our used plates and utensils. The pizza was really good, the pickled peppers were just spicy enough. It was medium sized pizza, but thin crust. Splitting it was a good small snack for 2, or a whole meal if you were hungry.   The vibe was casual, and it was right in the middle of the mall so if you were seated at the edge you could look out at the rest of the shops. It was pretty calm when we went, but if it were a busy day the restaurant would've probably been pretty loud with all the ambient mall noises.   Only gripe: the bathroom needed attention. It was nice, but the mirror was dirty and there was no soap. Other than that, it was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for my sister-in-law's 30th birthday dinner. We were able to be seated right away and had a great night. The food was delicious (most folks had pizza)! I especially loved the cauliflower side dish. The chilis were an awesome touch! Initially, the service was a little slow but once our food orders were taken the staff was around constantly for drink refills and the like. They also provided a yummy birthday dessert for the guest-of-honor. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Tried twice to visit Wolfgang Puck's in Las Vegas (City Center) and L.A. (L.A Live). Both times we arrived 90 minutes before closing time and we were told we couldn't have a table because it was too late! Their lack of professionalism it's incredible. They shouldn't Write a closing time if it is not going to be implemented! I'm sure that the neighboring restaurants appreciate this apparently sistematic way of managing their businesses."}
{"text":"Service was great from the start, as it should be. Ordered pizza... Spicy pepperoni, the pepperoni had a good flavor. As for the dough .. bland, I could bet the pizza sauce was basic tomatoes puree. Lack of seasoning overall. The price is what it is but please ...."}
{"text":"We chose this place based on Yelp rating for a Thanksgiving Day dinner.  It was a mistake.   The restaurant is in a shopping mall, but it makes the best of this location: Ambience and decoration are nice.   We made a reservation through OpenTable, but it turned out it wasn't necessary, as the place was semi-empty. The hostess seated us right away. We asked for a high chair, she said she would bring one right away, but we never saw her again.   Things started badly with a wobbling table. A waiter tried to help, but he could not fix it completely. Note: A restaurant of this class surely can afford to fix wobbling tables.   We ordered the prosciutto appetizer, the fettuccine carbonara, pappardelle with meat sauce, and some pasta with cheese for the little ones.   The $18 appetizer had some of the smallest, and certainly the thinnest slices of prosciutto I have ever seen. I like prosciutto sliced thin, but this is ridiculous. Just barely enough to taste the meat. The burrata that came with it was excellent, though.   Now, the big downer: All pasta dishes (including the plain spaghetti with cheese for the kids) were ruined by the massive, excessive amount of salt. I am not someone who avoids salt, but this was clearly too much. Maybe the B-team was in the kitchen on Thanksgiving Day, but still, there's no justification for serving such dishes.   The carbonara dish had nothing resembling classic carbonara. It felt like an improvised recipe without much coherence. The pappardelle with meat sauce were better (if you can forget about the salt).   We left without even thinking of ordering a dessert course."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is top notch! Eating here has been one of the best experiences of my life. The food and service was impeccable!!! My boyfriend ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer, and let me tell you that it was the best bruschetta we have ever had!!! It had fresh pesto, basil, tomatoes, and shaved parmesan! So delicious!  Since I am a vegetarian, I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was so good! My boyfriend ordered the sea bass and he loved it as well. We couldn't stop raving about how good everything was!!!   For dessert, we had the flour less chocolate cake and it was amazing. Everything was divine from start to finish!   My boyfriend and I are starting a new tradition where we make it a priority to eat here every time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Great food. Butter lettuce salad was perfect."}
{"text":"Went here to kill some time. Located in the Crystal Shops in front of the Aria. Hip looking place with a good sound track playing (very important). Ordered a Green Flash West Coast IPA, always a good selection, and also the Pork Belly Sliders. The sliders are tiny, tiny one bite size so beware."}
{"text":"This place is home to me. I love everything about this restaurant. I eat here every other day. The food is fantastic and the staff is amazing very professional.  Things you should try is definitely the pork belly panini"}
{"text":"Decent food, convenient location if you're at the Aria, and plenty of seating.  It's one of the places on the strip that don't charge you and arm and a leg and the perfect setting for a first lunch in vegas that goes right into a bit of shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dining experience here. We were looking for a nice relaxing place to eat before the Britney Spears show and we're able to get a last minute reservation on a Saturday night.   After hitting up a buffet for breakfast that same day,  I was looking for something light and flavorful. I ordered the minestrone soup and a salad with peaches and tomatoes. Both dishes were great,  but I really enjoyed the salad.  The prices were reasonable, the menu was well-rounded and the service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried the NY steak... it was poorly made and had zero taste, and it costed us 41$ a piece.. there must be better places in LV for a good steak."}
{"text":"Salad needed more dressing. Pizza was good.  Canoli was way to hard!"}
{"text":"The happy hour was great! The appetizer plates were very diverse and filling. The raspberry lemon drop was delicious not too sweet just right.  The staff was attentive but not hovering. Really nice environment for a late lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their bruschetta appetizer!  Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I always stop by in the Crystals shopping mall to dine at Wolfgang Puck.  The restaurant is very relaxed and comfortable.  I usually dress casually when dining here.  Definitely recommend trying the veal ravioli; it is amazing.  I've tried one of their pizzas which has the crushed red peppers on them.... THEY ARE SPICY! Super super spicy so watch out.  The price of the food is a bit high but they do have happy hour items served specifically at the bar seats."}
{"text":"Rude staff and unaccomidating to their guest.  We simply wanted to have a beverage in their empty restaurant as I was with my elderly parents.  They insisted we could only sit at the bar (which both of my parents would clearly have much difficulty with). If they had more than 2 other tables in use I would have completely understood, unfortunately MOST of the tables were empty.    Do Not spend your money with people like this!"}
{"text":"Amazing as always. Apollo was an amazing waiter, service was perfect and food was delicious.  One of the best Italian restaurants in Vegas by far.   Eggplant parm is some of the best I've ever had!  We always make a stop here when we are in town!"}
{"text":"This place was so good we ate there twice in one trip. Their Pizza is to die for. The food was big enough to share between two people. This is a place I could have eatin at every day if I had the chance. Their bruschetta was unlike any other I've every had. Everything tasted fresh and new. I love it! I will be eating there again the next time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love all Wolfgang Puck restaurants. always so delicious. I got the mushroom pizza and the eggplant parmesan. So yummy. I also wanted some meat so I got one side of their meatballs. It was so good."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner.  Nice spot inside a beautiful shopping space.   Great, well rounded, menu to fit all appetites and budgets.   Superior drinks, attentive service."}
{"text":"Inside city center and this place can be hard to find. Food, service and atmosphere were all good. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an excuse to go to Crystals and actually spend money on something there, you can thank Wolfgang Puck for making it possible.  Now, if you really want to hardly spend anything, there is also The Pods by Wolfgang Puck right beneath it, but I'd opt for the Pizzeria & Cucina.  The big question I had before going here was: is it better to go here, or the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at the MGM?  After now having gone to both, I'd much rather go here.  The ambience is far superior here, it's totally better to be at Crystals looking around than basically next to the casino floor at MGM.  I opted to sit at the bar, where it is happy hour all day and I felt like I could relax there all day. The bartender/server was helpful, personable, and even made a recommendation that helped save me money (he basically told me to just refill up on regular tea for free, as opposed to the one I ordered which costs $4 w/ no free refills).  Although I sat at the bar, there's a great variety of seating options all around, I'm a real fan of this layout, especially the white couch/booth.  My favorite thing I had was the Zeppole (see pic), even after eating all that food I was able to finish these 6 donut holes. When it was set in front of me, I thought there was no way I had room left for it all, but they were so good that I did!  They really do taste best if you put the caramel and gelato on them at the same time.  Their Spicy Pepperoni wood fired oven pizza is hard to resist too.   Easily one of the most awesome affordable places to go on The Strip for a meal or just snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant with decent price. We thought this restaurant located in such a good shopping area, it should be very expensive, and especially it's under wolf gang puck. But the bill was nice for us. With checkin at Yelp, we got 20% off of our entire bill. It's good.  -service: our server was nice and efficient. He came to us to take the orders and food was served within 10-15 minutes. -Cesar salad was good. Every leave was covered well with the dressings. It's fresh. -piazz: it's full of cheese, and the sausage mixed well with it. The pizza dough wasn't too thick.  -pasta: the sauce for the pasta wouldn't make us feel too heavy and the meat portion was decent.  It's a good"}
{"text":"I am now a fan, the flavor profiles on the different courses were unbelievable.  I now have to go and try all his restaurants even here in DC."}
{"text":"For us, the main attraction was the shopping mall (City Center) where this place is located.  We parked in the Aria hotel lot and took the Tram into the Crystals drop in the City Center.  At the top of the Tram station you can look down into the Aria swimming/relaxation village - that seems to be the most hip place for the under 30 crowd.  Lots of great scenery!  As for the WP pie, it was nice.  I would recommend one of the pastas over the pizza, which was great but not my first choice.  Pizza just doesn't need to be so gourmet.  Except I Yelped Pizza and so that's why we ended up there.  Coulda just had a slice instead of the whole $18 pie which I threw most of away."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located in the Crystal Shops next to Aria.  I stayed at Aria, so we decided to try this place.  It has a pretty casual vibe and has a clean look to it.  Even though it's located in the mall, it's pretty peaceful.  This mall doesn't have as much traffic, so it's a nice setting.  Service from the staff was awesome.  Our main course did come out on the slow side though.  Food, at least, tasted awesome.  ANTIPASTA SALAD: They don't have side salads, but they have half portions.  I had this and it was awesome.  This salad has salami, provolone picante, red onion, and red wine vinaigrette.  The picante and red onion add just the perfect spicy little kick to this.  RIGATOCINI: I loved my dish and fished the whole thing!!  It's made with Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic, and Parmesan Reggiano.  I am a red meat sauce type of person and this nailed it for me.  Added crushed red pepper to this dish for an extra added kick.  Portion size is on perfect so that you're not overly stuff, yet satisfied.  SPAGHETTI: This dish comes with tomatoes, basil, garlic, and four big homemade meatballs.  This is definitely a safe dish.  I took a bite from my mom's dish and it came nothing short of expectation.    SIDENOTE: We had to ask for bread and butter. So if you're a carb lover, feel free to ask your waiter and they'll be glad to grab it for you. (:"}
{"text":"Made reservations and got seated once we got there. Ordered antipasti salad, seafood linguine, torchio, Margherita pizza with pepperoni, brick chicken and a side of broccolini. Everything was delicious and seasoned well. The chicken was juicy and tender. Broccolini was so so garlicky and cooked perfectly. I showed the server my Yelp check in and got 20% discount. Love getting discounts for using Yelp!"}
{"text":"Food awesome. Service average. Waitress was a \" drive by\" waitress. Stopped by often enough but only to ask the obligatory question and often times never stayed long enough to hear our answer."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got a 4 stars. I had great expectations cuz it said WP, omg... I am so disappointed!!!!  I was imagining Cucina in Irvine spectrum, but definitely not the same category. We ordered the kale salad that I am surprised to say that Wendy's apple salad is much better. And their pizza was ehhhh. I'm just surprised how low quality the food was. I will never go back by my choice. Sorry, I try not to leave too negative comments on these, but this one had too big of a difference between the star numbers and what was actually provided."}
{"text":"There is too much good food in Las Vegas to eat anywhere mediocre, so I was super hesitant to eat at a restaurant in a shopping center.  But I was jonesing for a spaghetti carbonara and after a quick Yelp search, Cucina was at the right place at the right time.  and WOW, talk about surpassing expectations!  Their rendition of a pasta carbonara is the Torchio, which had recently changed and differed than the pics/reviews on Yelp.  I probably would have preferred the original version (with peas), but this dish was very very good.    But the real MVP was the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu.  It was ***spectacular*** (sent with fireworks).  The pasta was delicate and perfect, the sauce was delicious, the meat tender.  If it had a little less salt, it would have been flawless.  Portions are not over-sized like at most restaurants so the entrees might seem small to some people, but these two dishes are worth every cent.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention... they have a Yelp check-in discount - 20%!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So awesome! The cuisine was thoughtful creative and delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our server, cocktails and dinner. Prices were reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. I don't know if I'd go there during Dinner on a special occasion, as it's kind of casual. I'm sure you'd have picked that up already since it's in a mall.  I will say that this place could easily be a stand alone spot off a casino floor though.  Food was really good. I had the cheese ravioli. Portions are small, but a fair amount for the cost to taste ratio. I would highly recommend you keep this place on your top 20 when going to Vegas."}
{"text":"I give it a 4 only because of the food, however if you are starving and want your food fast DO NOT go here. They take about an hour to get you food and service is a bit slow with drinks. I would have loved if the waitress came and let us know that it would take an hour to get our main dish and 45 mins to get our appetizers."}
{"text":"Delicious meal! Started off with \"night at the burlesque\" cocktail (5/5). Then had the meat and cheese board (4/5) and completed the meal with pappardelle pasta!(5/5) I would have brought it home with me if I had a fridge and microwave!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is tucked away inside Crystals it is SO worth the trip.  The Old Fashions are habit forming as well are the Cosmos.  From the minute we entered we had the BEST service staff...friendly, courteous and very attentive. So...the food?  We tried several apps off the menu which were better than as described on the menu...came out very timely and served with class.  My party also tried one of their pizzas...with a little extra KICK of heat...WOW  it was oven hot..spiced just right..crust was cooked to GBD!.  My party split entree orders to some off the menu and some ordered the Chef's Specials.  My meal was a special and put together beautifully...the ingredients were delicious together...lamb sausage, fennel and broccoli rabe all served over pasta. The portion was not skimpy yet not overboard.  When I looked around the table there was hardly any food remaining on the plates that appeared to not need washing! The steak was perfect as well as the fettuccine dish. BRAVO to the Chef!  Regarding the dessert....their house-made Gelato sampler was to die for......But... Their zeppoles were the BOMB.  Now, Im originally from NJ where zeppoles are a staple at just about every pop up carnival, church function and San Gennaro festival..not to mention the shore areas. These were the best I had in all my xx years.  They were hot, not dense and sugared to perfection. I recommend the Raspberry dipping sauce which was out of this world...if only they jarred it for sale!  I would certainly visit this restaurant often...moderately priced, upscale atmosphere and great food and service. Cant ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for my wife's birthday and the food and service was top notch. Party of 8 and everyone was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, I think you're really just paying for the name. I ordered the salmon and it was OK but for the price tag I had higher expectations.  Wasn't bad but not worth the price and don't get me wrong i am willing to pay a little more for good food but this wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Puck's new Brasserie is amazing!!!  Had lunch their 3 times now and will go back all the time.  One of the best burgers I've had in town, fries are seasoned perfectly.  Also the sliced steak sandwich is amazing!!  Flavorful and great portions!!!"}
{"text":"All our food was perfectly cooked and the flavors were complex, yet not overdone.  We had a breaded pork dish that I would never usually get. It was very good.  My wife had a lemon chicken dish that was also nearly perfect though texture was slightly off.   Dessert somewhat disappointed.  Pumpkin cannoli was overcooked.  Italian doughnuts were good though, with the exception of the caramel sauce, nothing special.  I'd go back for sure.  What stopped a 5 for me was value."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was very slow.   The kitchen took 40 minutes just for the appetizers.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service sucked. We had to ask our waiter to bring us plates and condiments for our pizza after waiting and realizing that he wasnt gonna bring anything unless we asked. The girl in the front was rude. There are waaayy too many restaurants on the strip to waste your money on bad customer service - wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here to find some \"alone time\" during a week of meetings in Vegas.  Good for small groups but perfect for solo dining.  Simple trendy Italian menu that's worth it. Comfortable, friendly, and a really good meal.  Trendy environment, but not pretentious.  Great calamari, salads and personal pizza. People watching is fun as you gaze around the Aria mall at tourist.  Noise level is average so you can hear yourself think.  Flow is quick and fun.  Great staff, great food.  It's a find outside the craziness on the strip"}
{"text":"Vegas restaurants are usually a hit or miss; most of the time mid-priced restaurants are more a miss since they are often overpriced and their food is mediocre at best. However, this place was a pleasant surprise. The prices were higher because they were on the Strip but the food was delicious and the service was so attentive and friendly. Plus, apparently they have a happy hour at their bar that I failed to miss but their dining room service was great for me.   Mussels appetizer: This was DELICIOUS! The mussels are good but the sauce is what made this go from \"pretty good\" to \"omg delicious\" Plus, it was a generous amount that was good for the two of us there.   Lam Chorizo Pizza: Pretty good, loaded the top with lots of stuff and really flavorful   Mushroom Ravioli with Goat Cheese: YUM!! I love that it came with dozens of regular size pieces--I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give you 3 giant pieces of ravioli which you have to cut up at eat. This was really good and left me really full.   Caramelized Brussel Sprouts: True story--I've never had brussel sprouts before because Asian families don't serve it at home but the waitress kept raving about how these were better than what most people hate. First impression--it's not bad but it's not great. I'm sure it tasted better than the regular kind but ehhh I'll pass on this next time.   Good choice if you're not feeling like getting dressed up and emptying out your wallet for the fancier places but want to eat at a nice place. Plus you can use restaurant.com coupon here. Win"}
{"text":"Came to the bar and ordered a carafe of their red wine sangria and a margarita pizza.  Bartender was cool, I had a question about a particular beer they had on tap and he provided me a sample.  Service was very good, pizza was very good and so was the sangria.  No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Sorry Wolfy... I never got past how terrible the seating was ...low ottoman's that were more suited to Roman style \"eat lying down\" than an actual meal...(I must have missed the \"servent with fan feeding me grapes\" option?)  ...so low that you felt your knees were in your chin...not a good way to eat.  There was a variety of heights in the restaurant,  up to tall bar-stool style...but what we were unfortunate enough to get was awful and uncomfortable.  What were you thinking man? I spent half the evening trying to stretch my legs out to relieve the cramps .  Oh yes...and they also had food and wine there.  Sent the salad back as the vinaigrette dressing was so tart it made me spit the salad out!   Ravioli was edible.    wine selection and pricing was the best thing there...not overpriced for once (that earned you back a star)"}
{"text":"The set up was beautiful overlooking the Crystals shops in City Center.  Started with the shrimp scampi which was absolutely delicious, the perfect mix of spice and garlic with elegant presentation. While the service was attentive and the environment very calming, it seemed easy and enjoyable to take in the moment.  We decided to go with the margarita pizza, and when it arrived at the table it was hard not to be eager for the first bite.  You could taste the freshness of the ingredients, and the flavor of a true gourmet pizza was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any travelers and locals looking for an intimate, and affordable, gourmet experience."}
{"text":"Excellent server! Gave great recommendations and the food was excellent! Super friendly staff and clean. Made sure our soda was filled and checked to make sure we were happy. This will be a restaurant we frequent in the future! Our appetizer was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here, because apparently reading comprehension isn't my strong point in Vegas (read from this what you will) I thought we made the reservation at the Wolfgang restaurant in MGM, but it turned out for the best!  Our reservation was for 7, arrived just in time and were sat almost immediately. We all ordered pizzas, and they were the perfect size for us (with no leftovers which is a blessing as hotel rooms are not equipped with microwaves.) The prices are pretty reasonable for a restaurant with a well known namesake, and the people watching is OK in the middle of the mall dedicated to high end fashion.  End note: You can tell people you ate at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and let them assume you spent $$$$, pizza is always a good time."}
{"text":"I ate the Asparagus Salad, Parmesan Panna Cotta, Prosciutto dish. Was it AMAZING!!!! It was light and perfect for a late dinner. I would go here again, definitely."}
{"text":"Went here with the boys in Vegas one weekend.  Being hungover and miserable on a Vegas Sunday is the usual for me and this place got my taste buds rolling!  Their pizza is fantastic, the meat and pepporoni pizza is great and they will put on as much fresh grated parmesan cheese that you like!  The calamari was just on point too.  I really enjoyed this place because its smack in the middle of the MGM Grand Casino on the way towards the Garden Arena.    Very casual place to walk into and have a great pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star BC you can't give a half one! Our server was beyond the worst! It was like he was some sort of sociopath. He got the WORST attitude when my friend's food wasn't right. He didn't even care to right the wrong. No one said it was his fault but if the order wasn't right, fix it! Thank goodness for the guy in charge of the beverages. He was very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced for what you get. We had a terrible pizza and the pumpkin tortellini, which was tasty but dainty as hell for a $17 entree. There were 5/6 tortellinis! I asked the waiter to bring me bread (it was cold) because I was still hungry after the tortellini :-/ I don't recommend unless you're cool with ordering a bunch of sides. The pizza was just eh. The Caesar salad was also just ok. I wasn't impressed with the food, especially since the prices are on the high side. I was expecting more flavor in the dishes but was disappointed so I wouldn't come back. The staff and atmosphere were nice though."}
{"text":"We'd had a big lunch that day & we're looking for something a little less fancy for dinner.  Wolfgang Puck's hit the spot!  Started with the Burrata starter -- delicious burrata and tomato bruchetta (for lack of a better way to describe it).  Yum!  Had a pizza and a pitcher of beer.  Go figure -- but it was perfect.  The pizza (it was the three or four meat one, I think?) was great.  Nice thin crispy crust, the meat toppings were crispy and cheese was bubbly and nicely browned.  High end ingredients makes a difference.  Service was good and relatively quick on the refills, clearing the appetizer plates, etc.  Definitely will go back when looking for a less structured meal in the Bellagio/Crystals area."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the rave reviews of Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria. Was it awful? Nope. Was it great? Nope. I guess I'd go with somewhere in between.   The restaurant itself is located in a great spot. It was a lot of fun to dine in the new and super upscale shopping area at City Center. The atmosphere of the place was nice...I would have liked to sit in the bar area.   We made reservations for our Saturday night dinner and there was definitely no reason to. There were only a few tables full when we arrived at 7pm. Maybe we were there a bit early? I don't know how dinner in Vegas usually works. Either way, the place was fairly empty for a Saturday night. We were given our table immediately and the server greeted us shortly after.   I have to say that if this review was based solely on service...it would get a much higher rating. Our servers were incredibly attentive: our drinks were always full, plates were removed quickly, and the servers were friendly without over-doing it.   Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. Our food was incredibly disappointing. It wasn't disgusting, but it lacked flavor and quality. The prices weren't overly expensive (especially for Vegas), but I was expecting much more. I have had many a pizza in Phoenix that could easily kick the ass of the margherita pizza I ordered. The mozzarella wasn't fresh and the whole thing tasted fairly commercial. Wolfgang...you really let me down on this one.   So to sum this up...  Service = 5 Stars Atmosphere = 3 stars Food = 2 stars  Would I go back? Maybe...but probably not."}
{"text":"The food is definitely good. Unfortunately the place was nothing amazing. However the steak was on point and our server Tony was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place has great food  their quality of their food is superb  they also have special menu for lighter food ."}
{"text":"We liked the menu. We didn't like waiting 30 minutes for our Drinks. The server was nice but nothing came out right.  My soup must have been under a heat lamp bringing out...it was hot on one side and lukewarm on the other. There was no soup spoon on the plate.  My eggplant parm was ordered with no parm!! Of course, it came out covered in parm...my husband ordered his spinach on the side-his salmon came on a bed of spinach.  Our server Bobbie Jo apologized and said she would report to her manager...she NEVER DID...when I asked why the manager never came over after she gave us the check, she said she never told him or her!! All in all, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant hidden in the Aria Crystal Shops. Probably the best bruschetta we've ever had. Both the rigatoni and spaghetti entrees were delicious and the sauce was super flavorful. The service was notably good, our drinks were delayed so the waitress comp'd desserts for our group. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how in awe I am of the food here.  Came here after my boyfriend's roommate said he'd comp our appetizers as he's a manager there.  Started with the white sangria, which is the best I've tasted in Vegas. Lots of alcohol, not too sweet.  Waiters brought us apps on apps on apps.  - Mussels in chorizo sauce was BEYOND MAJOR. At first, I wasn't even going to try it because I don't like mussels. Tried the mussels and was in like. But, THAT SAUCE blew me away. It was so hearty and flavorful, I wanted to bathe in it. Waiter even asked us if we wanted more bread for it. - Pork and Beef meatballs. Ridiculously juicy and no need for the sauces they came with. - Pork belly. Not too salty and the picked garnish it came with went sooooo well with it. My 2nd fave after the mussels.  After all those apps, I was too full to even order anything. My boyfriend ordered the salmon, which is a never fail at any restaurant. The pea puree it came with was weird to think about but, tasted amazing.  Shockingly ordered dessert after all the food; and so glad I did. The donut (holes) were steller. I think they were lemon flavor bcuz of the bits of rind in them. They came with a chocolate and carmel sauce -- THAT caramel...SO GOOD!   p.s. Get a booth by the outside. Views of Crystal are pretty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service!  The best meal of our trip at almost half the cost of other swanky restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Service was poor and food just ok, especially for price. Also, they refused to honor Yelp promotion."}
{"text":"The food is good, better than average--but not stellar.  I had the yukon potato pizza, which was nicely executed and tasty.  2 others at my table ordered pasta dishes, which were OK--again, nothing to write home about.  Service was so-so: impersonal, perfunctory, the wait staff didn't seem to care whether you were there or not.  You could do worse; but you could do better, too."}
{"text":"The food was good generally but the service was not very good. The best dishes there was the rigatoni which was really chewy in a good meat sauce and the minestrone soup which was flavorful with chewy pieces of small, tubular pasta.  My spaghetti was pretty good too and the ribeye was decent but not amazing. Our server only came to greet us and take our order and then give us the check in the end, but throughout the meal, we had to ask the various bus boys and runners for various things. They mistakenly gave us an extra side dish which we never odered. Our food came out very slowly too even though we were one of the few people in the restaurant when we ordered."}
{"text":"we stopped here for a quick lunch and it was better the expected, great and very helpful service, we ordered ravioli and we got a pizza, ravioli was good, but the pizza one of the best!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great. Our waiter was friendly and hilarious! Definitely recommend the sopressata pizza. Perfect crust and perfect flavors."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed three nights in Vegas, and this was hands-down our best dining experience, both in terms of food quality and service quality.   Food: We had lamb ravioli (a special) and a chicken caesar salad (which was well above par for a caesar salad) and shared both the gelato and tiramisu desserts. All of the food was excellent. Portion sizes are a bit small for the price, but more than made up for in terms of quality and flavor! In fact, this was the only meal we had in Vegas that we thought was worth what we paid for it. Moreover, this was the perfect place for dinner just before heading into the ARIA to catch Cirque du Soleil's \"Zarkana;\" it also allowed us to avoid the restaurants within the ARIA itself.   Service: Our server was extremely knowledgeable and was able to describe each dish's preparation in great detail - it was actually very impressive. He was polite and prompt, and he and the other service staff kept our beverages consistently topped up.   Ambience: It's sort of in an exposed position in a mall, which you might think wouldn't lend itself well to an intimate dinner, but we were very happy with it. We had a table for two at the edge of the restaurant overlooking the lower level of Crystals. Noise levels were low (because who can afford to shop at Crystals? There's no one in there but store clerks!) and we were able to have a quiet, enjoyable dinner.  Overall, we had a great time and were very, very happy with Cucina - it's what I expected from the Wolfgang Puck brand."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful! And decor is eloquent. Portion size are small for price.   Staff is very pleasant . I had the salmon and the broccolini. Wish it came with another side but I was content. My friend had the chicken Parmesan and it was a good portion and looked really good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good and affordable, for a nice casual restaurant in the heart of Crystals.   They offer happy hour specials all night at the bar, which was actually convenient to sit at with our party of 4 as we grabbed a corner seat so that 2 people sat on each side and we were able to talk to each other easily. The happy hour menu offered some pretty good deals, a pitcher of sangria (red or white) for $18 and pale ales for $6. The handsome bartender was extremely friendly and chatty as he refilled our glasses of sangria and beer.   The food we ordered was surprisingly good. We had mushroom arancini for just $6 off the happy hour \"bites\" menu, calamari fritti, a insalata mista with grape tomatoes and parmesan, and a margharita pizza. While the pizza may not compare to the stuff in NYC, the marinara sauce tasted surprisingly fresh and tangy.   It was definitely nice to rewind here and get our buzz going after checking into the Aria without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Located at the CityCenter Crystals shopping complex, Cucina by Wolfgang Puck caters to your drinking and food needs.  When I arrived, I wanted to cry.  I had myVegas loyalty points I could have used up here...... :'(  Got the white wine sangria. It turned out to be the best drink I had all vacation. It has fruit slices. It brings white wine and makes it sweet. Omg it tastes REALLY good and it still has the alcohol taste in there. I think it was during happy hour, so I got a dollar or two knocked off its price. I don't think I would have enjoyed the red wine sangria as much though.  Friendly service and friendly bar service as well :D"}
{"text":"Went here with my family for an early dinner last week.  I must preface this review by saying that our waiter, Paul, was absolutely amazing.  He was attentive and knew the menu inside and out.  He recommended the chef's choice antipasti so we went with it.  It featured a number of random antipasti items on a platter to share.  It was unbelievably good!  For my entree I went with the fettuccine carbonara with a side plate of meatballs.  The carbonara was stellar and the meatballs were about as good as you can get.  The next time I visit Las Vegas I'll definitely be back for more! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch and loved it. Our server was Tony and he was amazing. The large meat and cheese board was perfect for two, and the rose was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"MEH! This place looks so fancy and all but the food is just not worth their prices. I got the clam linguinis and I simply wanted to change it to shrimp since I didn't like clams but they told me that would be an extra 2 dollars! I was like no TY since the linguini was already 14 dollars..... I  also didnt like the fact that they had happy hour but in order to get happy hour you had to sit at the bar. I mean my group was like 8 people and there was no way we wanted to sit at the bar AND eat food. I guess they're just losing business.  The bread was good though!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Starting with the seating all the way to the check, this restaurant is a gem! Friendly and smiling faces all over, doubled by high professionalism. Design with taste in the beautiful Crystals Shopping Center. The restaurant screams quality!  Our server, Paul, was more than just tending to our order; he really wanted us to have the best to pur taste. He suggested drinks and brought samples for whichever we wanted, to help us decide. He engaged in pleasant conversation, making our interaction with him a plus for the restaurant!  Food was beyond expectation. The antipasti are worth it: the soup I had was a perfect meal starter. But, the meal in itself was beyond doubt one of the tastiest I ever had. Marguerita Pizza for the win! The crust, the cheese, the tomatoes...there's no words for it! And you get to see your pizza in the oven. Just ask for a sneak-peak.    I still cannot explain how such a fine restaurant could practice such affordable prices. If ever in Vegas, don't miss it! We'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! The prociutto and arugula pizza was delish!! A nice casual place for a late night snack."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in on Tuesday (09/09) and sat at the bar around noonish. This is our first trip to Vegas And had no idea what to order. Our bartender Kristine recommended a couple dishes so we Split the minestrone soup and caprese salad which was AMAZING! Since I was still hungry I then ordered a sausage pizza And we split a pitcher of Hoegarden beer. The place was packed and seemed busy but our experience was a good one. Even though our bartender was busy she took care of us and made sure we had all we needed. I don't normally leave messages on help but we both felt that she went beyond the norm and I'd suggest to all of my friends to visit her and the restaurant. If it wasn't for our flight we would have stated longer! Can't wait to try more on our next visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurant stops! However tonight made us love it more!!! Everything in the menu is top notch!! The Chefs are super friendly!!  I recommend this restaurant and you must ask for Tony!! He's the hidden treasure! Thank you Tony for making our dinner perfect!! Xoxo Jersey loves ya!! -Giada"}
{"text":"Turkey panini was good but they served my coworker a chicken panini that was raw in the end. Service was ok. Wish they would've checked it better. That could be dangerous."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The pizza and the meatballs were delicious. It took a while for our food to come out so that was the only drawback considering it wasn't busy. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Delicious!  Eye pleasing! Nice atmosphere!  Good service!  We had lunch there. We didn't order any meat. We had mushrooms pizza,eggplant with pasta,espresso and Pana cota for dessert.  No leftovers!"}
{"text":"We come here for happy hour and sit at the bar. Our favorite drink is the red sangria. We usually get a pitcher. It goes down easy. The bar food off of the happy hour menu is always good. Items change every now and then. We love the Arancini. It is a nice open space st the center of city center.  The deck is wide open with a great view of the shops. The bathroom is very nice with a common wash area that is stylish."}
{"text":"Server Tony is a credit to the entire service community!! His menu knowledge combined with his genuine warmth will dazzle you from the start!!  The food-- omg the food will last in your best memories for a long, LONG time!!  Chef Scott has a top rate facility with an amazing staff that will make this one of best dining experiences you will ever have!!!"}
{"text":"Came here and had the happy hour pizza and zeppole. The pizza is thin and crispy which is not the style I like but it was ok. The zeppole was ok as well. Both dishes were not good enough to return"}
{"text":"Had margarita pizza and fries.  Wasn't to impressed with either one.  Was average at best.  Guess I was expecting a lot more because of the name, was super excited!  The worse thing of my dining experience was the service.  Me and my girl sat at the bar over 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging us!! Their was just one guest at the bar.  Will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST places we've been in terms of both food and service!!! Aside from the very attentive and knowledgeable staff, the food was not only aesthetically appetizing, but delicious as well!!! Love the ambience!! And special mention to our amazing waiter, Sean!!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food and stellar service!  Went for a late lunch with my family. Our server was very attentive and sweet.  We got:  Parpadelle - flavorful and delicious, meaty marinara sauce with thick and chewy noodles. 5/5  Prosciutto pizza - my favorite type of pizza did not disappoint! They could've been a bit more generous with the arugula though!  Italian fennel sausage pizza - great as well! The broccolini was a great addition:  The crust on both pizzas was great! Very chewy and not rubbery at all. My favorite part is when they came with a big Parmesan wheel and shaved off some for our food :)"}
{"text":"Ate at this wonderful restaurant for our last dinner in Vegas. We were in the mood for Italian, and wanted a memorable last meal of our trip. We had contemplated eating at other restaurants owned by celebrity chefs, however were discouraged with reviews of small portion sizes and the expense. This restaurant I think is an exception! We had an absolutely wonderful, hearty, filling meal for less than $75 (2 entrees, dessert, one glass of wine) which I think is pretty hard to find in Vegas.  I had the rigatoni which was amazing! My husband had the pork scalopinni which was also very, very good. The gellato-so good and creamy. Our waitress was friendly, professional, and gave very good meal suggestions. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent fare. Nothing to rave about but nothing to really complain about.  We had the antipasti platter, seafood with squid ink pasta, and the Sea bass.  Skip the antipasti unless you really want something to nibble on. Nothing on the board was a standout.  The pasta was good. A bit salty but still good.  The Sea bass was good. Great texture, nice seasoning.   Overall decent, and with the yelp check in, a great price for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Came out stuffed and had a great experience. I came here for the first time for my first time in Vegas and I would have not have picked another place to eat. Our server was great and the drinks were on point. We had to get drinks and food while we were dinning in.  I don't remember the exact name of my plate but I just remember it being super good the pasta is amazing."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends were all gambling it up at Aria and decided to walk over to the City Center and spotted this place. Looked like a nice spot to grab lunch/dinner. We came for lunch. We had a large party of about 11, so it took them a few minutes to set something up for us. Our waitress seemed nice at first, but she kept mixing up orders. 5 people ordered a salad, but only 4 came out and she said she thought that person wanted his salad as an entree. This happened multiple times for various things up and down the table. I am not sure if anyone came across rude to her, but I detected a hint of sarcasm in her tone later on.  We ordered some oysters - they were pretty fresh and standard also the calamari was very tasty. I ordered the Frisee salad with poached egg, lardon and bacon. This salad has to be one of the best salads I have ever had. This salad alone pretty much gives me a favorable view of this restaurant.  This next dish, I had some mixed reviews on. It was mussels with fries and the typical slice of bread. But the bread had this disgusting sauce smothered all over it. I can eat anything, but I had to tell the waitress that this sauce was a little overwhelming. Next time I ever order this, I would ask for no sauce on the bread.  I would definitely recommend this place but maybe for smaller groups. Also the price was a little steep for a lunch but hey it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is excellent. Perfect size crowd for a Wed night. Not too busy, not too dead.  I am sure it gets pretty crowded on the weekends. Awesome job on the drinks too. Tito's & tonic mixed very well!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with my family. We had reservations through OpenTable, and although we got there early they took us right in. Service was very friendly and quick. We had two pizzas which were both very good. Also had salads which were quite tasty.   Like everything in Vegas the meal wasn't inexpensive, but the food and the excellent service made it worth it. I would go back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars, Overall quite nice, but a few elements were lacking.  I went to two different places with WP in the name, and they couldn't be more different from each other. One was in the airport and was a huge disappointment. This place however, is located in a mall on the strip and was quite good for a place within a mall (very upscale).  We ordered the mussels as a starter,  two pizzas, and few sangrias. The drinks were good and very refreshing.   Were were served bread and butter to start. The bread was warm, soft, and crusty, all the qualities that good bread should have. The butter was served cold, I dont know if it was because we walked in two minutes before the kitchen closed or if that the way its normally served, but that was a negative. But the bread easily made up for this.  The mussels were steamed in a chorizo and garlic broth, and were served with some garlic bread. (picture included). The chorizo pieces (of which there were plenty) were almost better than the mussels, and ofcourse this lent to and excellent broth which we sopped up with the bread.  One of the pizzas had excellent quality toppings and both were well made. I personally prefer dough which is more chewy, but the way they cook it here is not too bad either. One pizza was a margherita, and the other had arugula and mushrooms. The margherita pizza, even though it was made on a technically good base,  was a huge disappointment.  It looked like a premade wood fired frozen pizza with a chiffonade of basil thrown on top. The cheese was also not very good, and it was definitely lacking in the tomato department.  The arugula and mushroom pizza was actually quite good. We all enjoyed it. I dont know all of the factors which made it so much better, but the cheese was completely different, and the drizzle of olive oil didnt hurt either.  The service was pretty much flawless, which is a pretty big deal given that they were just about to close when we walked in.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Oooh! A Wolfgang Puck restaurant!! First time eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant. We made reservations through OpenTable, love the points!   This restaurant is located inside the Crystals shopping center on the 2nd floor. You get a nice view of the shopping area too. Fancy! We were seated right away and our order was taken by the manager. Nice to know he participates. Sadly they ran out of the duck pizza. We ended up with the mushroom pizza instead.   I had the salmon with potato puree. It was lovely. Cooked perfectly still juicy and so so flavorful. My mouth was in love and wanted more. I enjoyed their complimentary bread too. Hands down the best bread I've had. Fluffy and bouncy on the inside and crunchy crisp on the outside. More please!   The pizza was so so which was sad to say since this place is supposed to be a pizzeria. They had 4 different kinds of mushrooms which was impressive, but the flavors did not excite my taste buds or put me on the edge for more. The bf had the same thought as well. Too bad we couldn't try the duck.   Tip: check out the Tickets4Less booths along the strip. They sell discounts to restaurants and can make reservations for you! We got 20% off the whole bill for $4."}
{"text":"I did not have food but the happy hour sangria pitchers totally worth it! Justin is awesome !"}
{"text":"A friend was in town and every spot in Aria was completely booked... So we decided on this spot and I have no regret. Amazing!! Ordered the trout and broccolini - perfectly prepared, not oily and well plated. Thanks Wolfgang!"}
{"text":"foods is good. casual restaurant but atmosphere ... all staffs are looks very busy."}
{"text":"For a popular named chief we expected more.  The environment had the feel of an American cafe rather than an Italian restaurant.  The mussels appetizer where good and the linguine with clams, shrimp and calamari had a nice spice.  The Carbonara pasta had too much salty Panchetta overpowering the sauce. The desserts were well presented and very tasty.  The waiter was very pleasant and the pricing was reasonable."}
{"text":"This was a delightful second floor Italian indulgence!!  I was happy the entire time I was here. First time trying eggplant and it will def NOT be my last."}
{"text":"I've tried this exact location twice-- first time amazing. That was in 2015.  I just tried this again in 2017 and could not have been more disappointed. We waited way more than 25 minutes to get our food. They couldn't even cook a steak correctly. Every chef should know how to cook a steak medium rare-- If you can't, I'm sorry but you don't cut it. We both ordered steak and both came out with almost no pink-- I didn't want to eat it. Not when you're spending over $40 for a NY strip.  They tried explaining to us that it is to temperature as if we were stupid.. So they cooked two new steaks, told us it would take 12 minutes. SHOCKER since it took more than 25 minutes the first time. We get the second round and we decided to eat it even though the meat didn't rest AT ALL and you could tell by the look of it. It was slightly more pink than the first one. My SO and I switched plates because his was better looking than mine. (eventually, with resting it, it looked fine) but completely mad they didn't know what they were doing. They have 6 or 8 Entrees, pasta, and pizza--how is this complicated?  I felt bad for the waiter but we were there for almost an hour and a half. To me, in Vegas, that's the last thing I want to be doing--waiting around for someone who can't cook a steak."}
{"text":"We go to Cucina (Wolfgang Puck Crystals Mall) often.  Most often we sit at the bar for drinks and supper.  It feels like HOME in all respects.  Good food, warm and generous service and smart pricing.   Love love the Wild Boar Pasta, Caesar Salad, meat balls, bruschetta, shrimp scampi and calamari.... trust me I have eaten a lot of Italian food everywhere and this particular restaurant keeps pulling us back in.   I would make one suggestion:  add a scoop of homemade ricotta with the meatballs.   The manager always remembers us.... AND my Favorite bartender in all of Las Vegas is Matt!"}
{"text":"Is there a better restaurant-mogul than Wolfgang Puck?   Forget the Batalis, the Minas, the Emerils, and the other also-rans. No contemporary american chef has had the impact that Puck has.  Brasserie Puck is another home-run for him. It's in the middle of the City Center mall, Crystals. A pleasant atmosphere, excellent service, and great casual french-bistro food combine to make BP worth the very long walk from the parking lot.  I had the Bistro Burger that comes with fourme d'ambert, my favorite cheese. It's a mouth-widening creation made with house-ground prime filet, and I never thought I'd say this but it's a serious threat to Bradley Ogden's rein as the best high-end burger in town.  The wine list is full of well-chosen, fairly-priced selections. And the management/service aspect is terrific. (My waiter had actually tasted every wine-by-the-glass on the list and therefore could make thoughtful recommendations.)  On top of that, there is a 25% discount for locals until the end of April, which makes Brasserie Puck an even more appealing destination.  I'm planning to go back soon because I've heard their Tuna-Burger is to die for."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest Wolfgang Pucks in the Vegas area. The ambiance is amazing and it's in Crystals where everything is nice so it helps. The menu is a bit different from some of the other Pucks and the Spaghetti & Shrimp is my favorite. Service is usually good but can be spotty. I live at Veer condo right above Crystals so they give me 20% off. I think they may extend that courtesy to all locals. Great place to have both a business lunch or a romantic dinner.  UPDATE: I had to downgrade my review because this place is inside Crystals and Crystals is not a place that is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great meal - we had spaghetti and meatballs, pasta puttanesca, chicken parmigiana. All fabulous. Great waiter, Tony. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I just had a beer and salad for quick bite. Ate at the bar - bartender was friendly. The menu looked pretty good but I just had the salad before going to a bigger dinner.  It was a basic green salad with very sweet tomatoes - very fresh and tasty. I will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Located at the Crystals Shopping Plaza at the Aria, this restaurant is one awesome spot.  First off, I love the Aria already.  Everything about it screams class and beauty.  This restaurant is no different.  The host was exceptional, the waiter was one of the coolest I've met during our stay in Vegas.  He was courteous and actually pretty fun to talk to as we conversated about my awesome watch for a good 5 minutes.  Needless to say, service is awesome here.  As for the food.   I decided to pick up the pasta linguine while my friend had the Sautéed Chicken Piccata.  Both our dishes were absolute delicious.  The downer was my pasta was a bit bland in terms of flavor but overall everything else was solid.  The shrimps and clams were so freshly made.  The texture was beautiful and the taste was pretty good.  We kicked it there for a good hour plus just hanging and talking.  Then the dessert menu came out.   I actually forgot what the name of the dessert was but its basically 3 scooped flavors of ice cream or gelato and they tastes really good.  Actually really really really good.  I could have eaten them all day but goddamnit I was so full.  Well done Wolfgang Puck.    Overall this was definitely a great dining choice on my part.  Great service, excellent quality food and a great ambiance creates an incredible dinner experience for my friend and I.  I will definitely be back here again next time I'm in town.  Too good to pass up.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Surprisingly food.    1. There is an all day happy hour.  Not the best deal but $6 beer and wine is not bad.   2.  Happy hour includes a few appetizers. 3. You can order half portions!  Half a salad, half pasta/pizza.    Since you are in the Crystal's, it is a bit quieter.  I had dinner around 7pm on a Thursday night at the bar with a Sofia Loren movie playing in the background.  It was a lovely meal.    By the time I left around 8, it was starting to get a bit crowded.  But food, ambiance, and staff were all pleasantly surprising.    Having been to many a \"celebrity chef\" establishment in Las Vegas, I was not expecting the affordable, pleasant meal I had but it was great!"}
{"text":"HUGE TURN OFF when your waiter asks how your meal is, and you inform him that your steak is tough & seems overcooked...  AND HE RESPONDS WITH, \"Guess it wasn't that bad, you're still eating it.\"  Uuhhhmm, okay?!  Thanks for making my Bday so memorable, I guess.   +++Too bad he had nooo ideaaa of the previous restaurant ordeal & how I didn't get to eat at all so I was STARVING out of my mind!!  I DO NOT send food back to be re-fired or re-made; I send it back to stay, period.  Hence my tummy situation when we got here for an early dinner.  Our lunch experience elsewhere was such that the kitchen failed to remove the melted Swiss cheese from my dish despite my clear request & our server's acknowledgement that the ticket stated this... meaning the kitchen simply made a mistake.  It happens.  But I can't do Swiss cheese!  So even though I was hungry, I literally could not eat it.  It was sent back & I sampled my friends' dishes to hold me over.+++  Having been to Ramsay's restaurants, Nobu, & others of culinary genius, we came to (Puck's) Cucina with high expectations.  Ordered the calamari & a pizza for appetizers.  Both were yummy.  Real talk, I'd come back for that pizza!    I ordered the ribeye special cooked medium-rare.  Now I don't know what was wrong with this steak, but ribeye is my cut & I make a mean cast iron seared, oven broiled ribeye at home.  ***This was theee absolute toughest, chewiest, bubble-gummiest, spit-out-several-bites-because-I-was-tired-of-chewing-est, most bland ribeye I've ever had!!***  Like, beyond being overcooked, the texture was such that I THINK THEY RAN OUT OF THE RIBEYE SPECIAL & tried to pass off a cheap chuck steak, bottom sirloin, or other lower quality cut.  It was sooo tough, but looked only slightly overcooked.  I didn't understand at all.  But I was so hungry by this point, I just enjoyed my side veggie & ate what I could of the horrible steak as opposed to sending it back to stay.    I had to ask the waiter's assistant for salt because our server went MIA for a bit after bringing our food.  Others in our group also needed salt...  namely, the salmon entree and the pasta dish, both of which I tasted.  The chicken parm was tasty as-is.    Later when our server came over to ask about the need for salt & how our meal was tasting...  I was honest.  Mine was a bit bland, very tough, and appeared overcooked.  Funny that even the waiter commented, \"Maybe you just happened to get that one weird ribeye.\"  Yeah, I bet.  Then he added, \" Guess it wasn't that bad, you're still eating it.\"  I didn't even bother explaining to him that (1) I have a rule about sending food back to be re-made... (2) how I was pretty hungry from my earlier fiasco... (3) we were in town celebrating my BDAY!...  since he clearly wouldn't have cared anyway.  He did end up bringing a complimentary dessert item for my troubles.   Given his \"I really don't care about you\" attitude, I wish I had sent it back & gone hungry a little longer so as not to pad his personal bottom line (tip)--  the ribeye special was $55.    I would only come here for appetizers & drinks... and even then, they would need to address the terrible service/ attitude I received."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place in a great location as others have stated.  The food is good with a mix of great, OK, and so-so foods that we ordered.  Service was very good and is a place well worth going to for a nice lunch in Vegas.  My family ordered calamari for an appetizers that was good (3 Stars).  For our main course we ordered the cheese pizza (4 stars) and the prosciutto pizza (3 stars) for five of us, and some chicken fingers with fries (4 stars) for our 3 yr old.  Everything came out in a timely manner other than the chicken fingers that took a little longer.  Service was good with water in cups and making sure everything was OK.  Overall a 3.5 star place with good service so a 4 star eating location.  This is one of the cheaper nice locations to eat at too in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriends salmon was good and the service was pretty satisfactory. Just consumers beware of the steak! I had to spit out and cut off about 3/4s of it because it was so fatty. Perhaps it would have been better had I not gotten the steak."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised. I came here thinking that it was going to heavy, unhealthy and greasy food. But it wasn't. The food was delicious. The server was very attentive. Great dinner after all."}
{"text":"Expensive veal scallopini tasted like it was from the OLIVE GARDEN. The service was a little slow. Overpriced.   They need a menu do over"}
{"text":"Great food  Great service Amazing time! Ask for Apollo. Great guy with great service!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The speciality Italian meats and cheese platter appetizer was amazing. The spaghetti and meatballs was also really awesome. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"So my sister was leaving town last Friday and we had not made our way to Crystal's (City Center) right next to Aria Hotel. Is it Crystal's?  Is it City Center?  Too many names and confusing!  Anyway, we sat at the bar where HAPPY HOUR is offered all the time.   Bartender took his sweet time to take our order and there were only two other people sitting at the bar. It was only like 3 p.m.    It took him 15 minutes to get our drink ORDER.   We were sitting at the bar?  FINALLY he took our order, I ordered the stuffed peppers with goat cheese.  These are tiny nibbles so don't expect a huge portion. The pepper is the size of a grape.  But the flavor is fantastic.  I LOVE GOAT CHEESE. They drizzle some olive oil on it so for me, it was perfect.  We had some red sangria which I recommend and the pizza with Arugula and mushroom. That's always my go-to.  I do have to say the next bartender that came on shift was a delight and seemed more on the ball, so the knucklehead that was there earlier gets a one star!   They do serve gluten free pasta here too.  I think next time, I'll sit at a table!"}
{"text":"Totally underwhelmed. Chef Boyardee wouldn't can the ravioli I was served. First I was upset by the small portion, then I was grateful for the mercy of it. My wife's carbonara was equally bad. No creme, no flavor, all oil with a ton of pepper. Vegas mall foodcourt quality at best."}
{"text":"Thanks for the Yelp app and OpenTable.com available on my phone, I ended up here with the family for Christmas Eve dinner. I liked how I made a reservation online while standing outside the restaurant; yay points!  Anyway, I read fellow Yelpers' reviews sounded and it sounded promising although I usually avoid Wolfgang Puck's restaurants (haven't had a good track record.) For starters, the service was sub-par; yes I understand it's Christmas Eve but common, 40 minutes for thin crust pizza. The people around us came in later and were on dessert when we got our food. (Side note: the salad and calamari appetizer; YUM; came very promptly.) Then it took forever to get the check, then even longer for the receipt. Plus the manager went around to ask other tables how their meals were and to wish them happy holidays but not us.   Sorry I digress, back to food. The pizza was not very tasty. The prosciutto was so bland and the lamb chorizo was...okay. Sadly I will not be back."}
{"text":"i've been to some pretty underwhelming puck joints, but this one was fantastic. truly great pizzas, balanced in flavor. great crusts, i mean really great. i had the side with the beans, peas and mint and it was delicate and wonderful. great service and kind of a fun thing to eat in that interesting space."}
{"text":"this is a great place to visit while shopping (the ambience in city center can't be beat, in retreat from hordes of tacky tourists on the strip). the pizza is not exactly of must-taste caliber. ingredients here sound interesting but don't deliver anything too memorable. nevertheless, i can't stop dropping by-it's like she's my vegas trophy wife.  sit at the bar and get a pitcher or two of the tasty(authentic) sangria-strong and sweet! service is always great. prices are surprisingly low whether or not you make it to the bar(nothing on the bar happy hour menu jumps out, so far)."}
{"text":"I was reeled in by all the good reviews of this place, so while I was in Vegas I dropped by for a bite.  While the service at the bar wasn't that great (we weren't drinking, so that may have had something to do with it), the food was excellent.  I went with the gnocchi, which I read rave reviews about, and it was delicious.  The bread, of course, was great, too.  The prices, for Wolfgang Puck's name at Crystals in Vegas, are actually quite reasonable.  This place has my vote.  I will definitely drop by again next time."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, food was great and the service let me tell you it couldn't get any better than that. Oh and can't forget we had an awesome waiter named Tony his service and staff were amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the ribeye steak.  It's been dry aged and really yummy!  The doughnuts are also great!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: All day at the bar HH Specials: $5 sangrias, $7 select cocktails, and lots of small bites  I want to preface that this review is only for their happy hour/bar experience. I got both of the sangrias and shared a plate of wings and tiramisu. I was not a fan of either sangrias but if I had to choose, I preferred the white one because the sprite complimented it much better than the red. I'm not a fan of carbonated sangrias and almost wished I asked about it before ordering.  The wings however were delicious! Reminiscent of the seasoning in Thai MAMA noodles. They were fried to perfection and was properly seasoned! The tiramisu was a little disappointing. I get that HH food is usually smaller portions with less effort but this baby tasted like it was popped out of its packaging and stuck on a plate.   All in all, it was an okay happy hour. I'd love to come back to actually dine in to see if the experience is different."}
{"text":"So Wolfgang Puck...isnt he suppose to be some outrageous mastermind Chef. which recipes exploding with flavor? I dint know I think I might of missed something because I was not in pressed.   Our party was huge so we had the VIP area. The location is in Crystals which is a very nice upscale shopping center. The service was very good for such a large party. So thumbs up to them.   So lets talk food...my husband and I both ordered pizza. We were both disappointed in the pizza. It was very very plain and lacked that explosion of flavor you would think Wolfgang Puck would have. Our friends ordered lasagna which looked very good. There were also various pasta dishes ordered as well within our party. One thing that surprised me was the potion sizes. They are very small. But I guess you pay for the taste not the size? I was still hungry.  You may like this place. SErvice is great, prices are not to high for the area and you dont need to be to dressy, but that doesnt mean wear flip flops and shorts. And I am sure there is something better than pizza on the menu for your dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Apolo, our server, was very accommodating and nice. He let us know the right wine for our meals and was super knowledgeable about the food. I loved the flavors of the dishes. I had the Ravioli with bolognese sauce that was very succulent and rich. I would totally come back again on our next visit to Vegas. Perfect Italian flavor in good portions -- well done Wolfgang !"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment! The service here as terrible and the lady at front desk was snotty. Our server was even worse and you could tell that he hated his job. He took forever to take our order and didn't come around very much to check on us. The food was ok and nothing special. The food lacked so much flavor and was very bland. The bill was pricey for crappy service and crappy food which I hate paying for. The area that the place is located in is in the crystal shops mall and is is really nice but that is the only thing that is nice about this place. I would not come back to this place. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Decided to grab something to go and while we waited I got some bruschetta which was ok..i wouldn't get it again nothing special but the white sangria was delicious and it sparked up a convo with the three guests next to us.  We ordered the calamari with i think a basil aioli sauce? it was DELICIOUS!! i sure loved it over the normal marinara sauce. We also got the spaghetti and meatballs which i highly recommend! I cant wait to go back i wish they had one closer to home!"}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely slow, but other than that we had a pretty good experience.   My boyfriend and I ordered: Calamari Prosciutto pizza  What we loved: calamari, lightly battered, lightly fried, very very tastey.   I loved my experience here. All the staff was very friendly and tentative. We rarely get service like this back in the city, which makes me love this place so much more. The food was delicious, but I do have to say it's a little on the pricey side.   Next time I come, I'll definitely check out what the happy hour is all about."}
{"text":"Had Lunch here. Located in the Crystal Shops, its a charming little spot with friendly staff and good food. There was plenty of bread, but it was rather hard, and not freshly baked.   I ordered a calamari appetizer which was great! The caesar salad and Scampi  dish were well done, but not outstanding. I would certainly dine here again."}
{"text":"I only came here because it was open and it was close to my hotel, and I'm glad I did!  We had the duck confit pizza, the caramelized brussel sprouts, and a risotto special.  The duck confit pizza was delicious, but the brussel sprouts are to-die-for! I normally don't like brussel sprouts, but my sister loves them, and the waiter was sold on them, so I thought I'd open my mind a little and give them a try. They blew my mind away! This is one dish that shouldn't just stay in Vegas!!!  The risotto special was just okay - I don't even remember it much - that's how memorable it was.  Moral of the story: TRY THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good!  Also try the Red wine Sangria...it was amazing.  The only reason I give 4 stars is that after ordering a $8 bottle of san Pellegrino, I found an oily film on the surface of my glass, it was probably parmesan.  I informed the waitress and she could have given us a new bottle or taken it off our bill.  Pretty much half the bottle had to be thrown out.  The food was great though and I'd recommend it, nice location and ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Perhaps this is more of a \"quick tip\" than a review, but here's what I can say: Sit at the bar.  Order the small bites and a pitcher of sangria, and escape the tremendously high prices around you with above average, branded food at above average prices.  WPP&C has a happy-hour-esque bar menu with small bites--like stuffed peppers, mushroom pasta balls, and small-portion paninis.  Prices are reasonable, and the food is tasty, if not particularly different from food you could get at a Wolfgang Puck in an airport.  3.5 stars, rounded up because everything else in Crystals includes prices that makes one's head explode."}
{"text":"OMFG, the food here is freaking delish!  Came here for dinner with the parents.  Had a bad tummy (yeah, shouldn't have had froyo since I hadn't had dairy in like 2 weeks, Pepto didn't help).  Got the pizza with a few modifications (no dairy & no leafy veggies).  Had to get something a bit on the low fat side (high fat intolerance).  The Italian Sausage pizza did the trick.  The roasted garlic added a certain kick to the pizza & didn't over-empower the dish.  There was constantly someone walking around to see if customers were happy.  Love, love, love that!  I got a ginger lime soda or tea of some sort.  Sooo delish!  The food came a bit out late, but was well worth it.  The food is a bit pricey, but worth every penny for the fresh ingredients & the well balanced dishes.  Ambience was cool & airy."}
{"text":"The beet salad with goat cheese was sweet and had perfectly blended flavors.  The atmosphere is okay as it is in the middle of a shopping area; our table was right by the escalator."}
{"text":"Cute place at Aria. The food was OK but I wouldn't name it one of Wolfgang Puck's best restaurants. The beets on my salad were a little bland. Also, the server kept pouring wine on our glasses as if he wanted us to finish the bottle quickly so we could order another one. On one occasion, I had to actually stop the guy because my glass was more than halfway full. There was no need to continue to pour wine in there. Finally, my pasta had great flavor; however, it was a bit too salty. I do have to say that everything had a beautiful presentation. Would I give this place a second chance? Possibly."}
{"text":"I order 2 of each dish for Togo... after 45 minutes, I only received 1 of each order... they at least charge me correctly... I'm not about to go back again and take another order and wait for another 45mins..."}
{"text":"Apollo was our waiter and he was just fantastic. Would come back again. Food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service stupendous. I'd go back anytime.  We started with the Sausage Pizza andbit was very good with sausage,  broccoli florets and Green Peppers. We had a side of meatballs that was delicious."}
{"text":"Ok not what I expect from the name Wolfman Puck a good chef. Food very like going to Denny's or Applebee"}
{"text":"The place is pretty dead but the food is great. If you want a casual lunch with great food, i highly recommend the place. I got the spaghetti and added meatballs which were delicious.  Meatballs were very soft and tender and the spaghetti sauce was on point.  Add in great service and this place gets 4 out of 5 stars.  We also split the caesar salad to start which was also great. A little light on the dressing so we asked for more"}
{"text":"We did a dinner for 4 here and went with a family style pre-set Sunday dinner menu of various things they brought out including desserts. Was overall real good with appetizers of calamari, artichoke bruschetta and salad, then came mains of raviloi, a real good white fish, super good spicy chicken cooked under a brick a noodles in a meat sauce.Dessert was an apply crumble thing and little donut balls to dip in vanilla sauce. Not crazy expensive but plenty of food for everyone. Good service too."}
{"text":"Decent place on the Las Vegas strip. I wasn't impressed for the price, but that's the Vegas mark-up, I guess.  I ordered the gnocchi in bolognese, which was solid if plain. I expected a bigger size for the entree, especially compared to my friend's side dish of mac and cheese, which had more than twice the amount of pasta. That struck me as strange. I'm also not 100% convinced that the bolognese is totally authentic, but I may be a stickler for it since I make it, myself.   The sangrias are cheap and yummy.  I would not return - there are so many restaurants on the strip, might as well find one I actually really enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff, amazing barrel-aged Old Fashioned, delicious meal. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"It was the meal Friday night. I ate the meal. The meal was pleasant. It did not have the flavor of saffron. It was still pleasant. Thank you."}
{"text":"Five stars don't cut it for this restaurant. This place is crack. They lure you in with their amazingly cheap prices and you get the biggest trip of your life. I tend to walk around my chair when I get a dish that is tasty, well here, I walked around the bar... TWICE!  I went for lunch and they have this great deal for a prix-fix for $25. Choice of three appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 dessert. The fact that I'm writing this review after the entree, means that I know dessert is going to be stellar.  I started with the prosciutto which was accompanied with a burrata which was to die for. Very creamy served at the right temperature.  The entree I went for basil ravioli. I don't know what it was filled with, but I do know that I cleaned my plate... The sauce, the filling, everything was just great.  Now I just did my third lap around the bar after I tasted my tiramisu. Light and delicious, perfectly balanced.  Did I mention everything is dirt cheap compared to other \"good\" restaurants in Vegas? Prosecco for $9, all entrees below $30.  Sherlynn was a great bartender. Easy to talk to, sweet and on point  For a moment, you think your no longer in a mall, but it brings your senses to Italy. They should change the interior and music a little to match the Italian lifestyle"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, actually was trying to find somewhere a little different but ended up here - WHY?  Because I've NEVER had a bad meal at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.    The food was fantastic, we started with a Prosecco and wanted to keep it light (so we could hit the happy hours later....).  We shared the muscles with Chorizo.  They were perfectly cooked and the chorizo was excellent in the sauce.  Not over powering, just flavorful.  If you like muscles, a MUST TRY.    We then shared a Prosciutto Pizza with Mascarpone Cheese, Arugula & Aged Balsamic.  WOW - Light, flavorful and everything was great together.  I wish I could buy the balsamic they used, not overpowering at all.  The Mascarpone cheese on the pizza was also a nice surprise.  The ingredients were fresh and the food was simple, that's the sign of good Italian food!  I'll definitely try to recreate this at home.    I've eaten at the Airport Wolfgang Puck Express restaurants, Spago and many in between - he's done a great job at keeping the food consistently great at every level."}
{"text":"Good food.  Enjoyed a great pizza with pesto and prosciutto; good spaghetti with meatballs; and  so-so tomato caprese salad.  That said, the atmosphere was as cold as this beautiful but frigid designer mall."}
{"text":"Great food. The pasta and bread is so filling. Their wine selection is really large and quite good. Like the location (no smoke). Atmosphere is really nice. Great service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service.  We went with a big group and were not disappointed. Pizza is yumalicious."}
{"text":"We came in because we had a bogo from myvegas. It was a Tuesday evening and we were the only people there. I was kind of hoping for pizza because they looked really good on the pictures i stalked on yelp. However, the bogo was for the meals. I ended up with the burratta raviolis and bf had the chicken piccatta. We really liked the attention to detail. At one point, our waiter came by and said he had the kitchen redo my bf chicken because it was overcooked. It seem a bit strange since the kitchen was not busy but i did like that our waiter didn't wait for us to complain about it. My raviolis were really good but I think the sauce could have been better. Our waiter did a great job recommending wine. I normally don't like merlot but he recommended one. Since I mentioned i dont usually drink merlot, he asked if i would like to try a couple. He gave me a blind taste of a few, and lo and behold, I liked the merlot best."}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience I've had in Las Vegas - ever. Apolo was our server and he was so fantastic. There were five of us and we got an assortment of things across the menu. We took advantage of the half price wine list that runs Monday through Wednesday. The mozzarella in the caprese salad was unbelievably fresh and the salmon was the best I've had in a very long time. If I could give more than five stars for Apolo's friendly demeanor and amazing service I would. Can't wait for our next trip to Las Vegas, because this is definitely somewhere we will go again."}
{"text":"The service was nice, food took a long time to come but that's not the issue, the issue is quality. Pizza was okay for the U.S. but from such a name and such a price I expect excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy the linguine clam. We have lunch there today, good view and ambience. The dessert tiramisu is also great. The location is also good, and this should be one of the best choice in this area."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our server, Javier, was friendly and knowledgeable. Tony the manager was personable and hilarious. 13/10 would dine again because y not."}
{"text":"Un des meilleures restaurant à Las Vegas. À part que le resto est dans un centre d'achat. L'ambiance est bien mais la bouffe est merveilleuse."}
{"text":"I was so fortunate to stop by last week. I loved the new iteration of the mushroom pizza with leeks, and the old fashioned was quite yummy. I might have to make this my new go-to spot at Center Strip!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because my brother had recommended it to us. Our waitress, Lauri, was amazing, she took time to teach us a bit about wine, which was pretty neat. She even gave me a special birthday treat. :) Our portions were great, food was good...Maybe a bit too salty on one of the dishes, but that would be our only complaint."}
{"text":"I went here to kill some time while the wife shopped; have some sangria at the bar and had a long conversation about food with the bartender.  The sangria was little too sweet so he took it off the bill and made me another delicious cocktail.  I finally ordered a few apps which were good but the one that really got me excited was pizza lardo.  It's cured pig fat on top of a piece of pizza dough.  Its sounds gross but since I never tried it and I'm a big prosciutto fan I figured I should give it a try.  It was amazing; I actually went back the next day to order it again but it was a special and they didn't have anymore.  Great service, good food and a new experience gives it 4 stars."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner a lot. I ordered the linguine and the prosciutto pizza. Both were very tasty. I especially recommend the linguine!!  Other than the food, the service here is very on point. Theres also happy hour all day. The drinks are very affordable. Overall, this is a good date spot. When I was eating here with friends, there are many couples enjoying their time at the bar."}
{"text":"I came here for a celebration of my girlfriend late birthday and it was a great time. We told them ahead of time that it was her birthday and they treated us very well. They even printed out personalized menu's for her birthday that had the specials.   The food was great as well. Me and my girlfriend shared spaghetti and meatballs and an Italian sausage pizza the spaghetti was very flavorful and the meatballs were perfect. Tender and tasty. The pizza was a good thin crust and a pretty decent size.   Thanks for taking care of us Evan"}
{"text":"Sat at bar. Good meal. Pappardelle as my main course. Solid dish."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite if youre around the Crystals shopping area/ Aria proximity. The restaurant is situated overlooking the Crystals shops which gives you near perfect view for people watching!  Food was pretty good, def worth trying/ coming here for a meal."}
{"text":"The place was very good, but one of the waitresses gave special recommendations of food which is see food plata, it turns out so dry see food with out any sausage and when we want to lay it was so expensive 95$ which doesn't deserve"}
{"text":"Our first time at this Wolfgang puck cucina and from reading all the reviews, we did expect good food and surely Wolfgang did not disappoint.  Pros:  happy hour at the bar all day, so some food items, wings, cheese, meats for $6-8 and drinks (sangria -white/red -$6 and three varietal of wines ranging from $5-8 a glass as well as beer)  Pasta dishes are pretty amazing, we had the pappardelle and linguine with seafood and white wine.   Cons:  the pizza we had was nice and crispy as requested but wasn't amazing - margarita - possibly the prosciutto with arugula may be a better choice or the mushroom with a hen egg.  The free bread is also quite fresh however our server was pretty slammed so we had to request it rather than getting it while we waited, we actually got it after getting our pizza and we sat for about 10-15 minutes before we got that. So that takes it down one star and I had to ask multiple times for a water refill. So although service is decent when he is not slammed but over the impression that there was more care to the four top next to us because they had a lot of specific needs.   Pricing wise- it's decent for the location, considering every store in this mall is high retail and brand name only. You would expect clientele that can afford to be in there."}
{"text":"Attentive staff. Fancy pants place but the price is right. Not cray expensive. Pizza was good."}
{"text":"After wandering around the Strip aimlessly for a half hour looking for decent places to eat that won't break the bank and that aren't filled with all the crazies that hit up Vegas on Memorial Day Weekend, we ended up on Wolfgang's Pizzeria in the Crystal's shopping center between Aria and the Cosmopolitan.   It wasn't my first choice since I've eaten at his restaurants several times before, but his restaurants never let me down.   I forget which cocktail I had exactly--just remember that it was good.   We had the Italian Cured Meat Platter with pepper relish (which i could have eaten by itself with a spoon) and the Wood Fired pizza with sausage, ramps, and peppers. Both were classic and delicious as expected.   Our waitress was friendly, easy-going, and prompt. And the atmosphere was very chill."}
{"text":"A group of us had been pretty much drinking and walking around the strip all day until we got hungry and stumbled into this place.  (i dont even really remember where it is).  I think we were attracted to all their tvs showing the NBA playoffs.  Its a pretty fancy spot with a nice, intimate environment and elegant decor [I think].    I ordered the veal ravioli and a side of carmelized brussel sprouts.  I devoured my delicious baby cow stuffed pasta within minutes and shared my brussels, which the whole table agreed were amazing.  They were the best brussel sprouts I have ever consumed in my entire life (sorry mom).  But I seemed to be the only person super impressed with my meal. Everyone else seemed to say their food was just OK.  Aside from the food being good, the service was kinda wack for a nice restaurant.  The dude spilled hella our Sangria while he was pouring it, even on one of the girls legs, and on top of that, they took forever to bring just a side of ranch.  If you go, order the brussel sprouts and pour your own drinks if you can."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and, even though our waiter was nice and attentive, he was so dang animated that it grew tiresome. He greeted us with what seemed like a song and dance show. However, the low star rating only reflects the food. The linguine was a bit flavorless and the pasta had a texture similar to whole wheat pasta, so I didn't really enjoy that. The chicken was nice and tender and flavorful. We also got the appetizer mussels and bruchetta. Mussels was in a red sauce that I wasn't too fond of and they only have two small slices of bread to dip the sauce in. The bruchetta had a great flavor but I didn't like how the bread was so thin, the sauce ws quick to soak up the bread and sog it up. Prices here are pretty decent compared to other Vegas places, but it's not some place I'd crave for."}
{"text":"Great service. Disappointing pizza. Luke warm, unimpressive, bland...not up to WP standards. Nothing close to the beautiful pizzas on this site. Far better options nearby to give up a good meal on this choice."}
{"text":"I give then 3 stars based on food and drink quality. It was our service that was awful. I had to call to our server at nearly every point in the meal, from initial drinks, starters, main meal, follow drinks and the bill. To sum it up, no chance we'll return. The pear martini  was very good, I had 2 of them."}
{"text":"An excellent start to Restaurant Week! My friend and I had a great meal and I look forward to returning to Cucina in the future.  We shared most of the Restaurant Week menu and added an Italian Meat Pizza. I loved the freshness and flavor of everything we tried.  *Summer Panzanella Salad- fresh ingredients with croutons that were slightly softened without being soggy from the dressing *Sweet Corn Ravioli- amazing, the flavor was on point and I loved the burrata in the middle of the dish *Chicken Piccata- one of the best piccatas I've had with a great tasting sauce and delicious vegetables  *Italian Meat Pizza- delicious meat and olives on a nice, thin crust *Tiramisu- perfect texture and taste *Chocolate Budino- loved the chocolate flavor and the firm chocolate cake pieces with the delicious cherries  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The restaurant is in the middle of the Crystal shops with a bright, open dining room. The service was attentive and friendly. No complaints on the service."}
{"text":"Great great service, Jeremy at the bar was awesome!! Manager on duty was also super friendly!!  Recommend pork belly slider on happy hour menu"}
{"text":"After doing some major shopping damage at Crystals, my friend and I worked up an appetite and ended up at Cucina by Wolfgang Puck.  They offer all day happy hour at the bar, but we opted for a table to try their menu.   Bruschetta (Special of the Day) - It comes with 3 pieces of bread, drizzled with balsamic and pesto, topped with cherry tomatoes, cheese, and greens.  Great way to start the meal!  The pesto was a nice touch to make it unique.  It's crunchy, a little acidic, fresh, and sweet.  Frito Misto - Fried calamari, shrimp, cauliflower, shishito peppes, onions, and slices of lemon.  My favorite dish that we had that day.  Everything is lightly coated and fried to perfection.  The two aioli that comes with it is a chili aioli (orange colored) and a lemon aioli (white colored).  Both pair beautifully with everything.    Fettucini Carbonara - The noodles are made in house.  You can order either a half or full order of pasta.  We got a full order and the server brought it out in two plates so we can share, which was very nice of him.  The fettucini comes with pancetta and zucchini with a light cream sauce.  Half an order is a good amount for one person!   I had a great experience during lunch!  The food was really good, everything is reasonably priced, and our server was spot on with his recommendations and service.  Definitely excited to go back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great.  Classy place to eat. Had lunch here with a friend, more quiet than places on the strip."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party and they did not have many dairy free options for me . I believe there was only one entree which was the fish and that same night I got terribly sick from it . I paid a lot of money to get sick from a place that only had one option for me . Servers were very nice though that's why there's a star ."}
{"text":"Stopped in on one of the few rainy days in LV and could have spent the afternoon. Small plates were great. Try the house aged ole fashioned and ask for Tony."}
{"text":"good for groups, staff is pretty understanding and patient. they have a full bar and is reasonably priced. great place to hang out before you dance your face off at marquee"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 3 stars for Cucina by Wolfgang Puck at  Crystals, but unfortunately I cannot.  Let me start by saying that the food is very tasty.  My husband and I ordered 2 pizzas (Italian Meat and Mushroom), and a Caesar Salad.  The food came out hot and delicious.  It's the service that brought down my stars.  We were greeted when we walked in and seated.  Sadly, our server never once came to our table.  I can't remember his name, but he was nowhere to be found.  If it wasn't for the server assistant who provided excellent customer service, we would have left.  In fact, when we were finished our lunch, we asked to speak to the manager.  We didn't really complain to him, we just wanted to make sure our tip and recognition was given to the young man who helped us and not the real server."}
{"text":"Great spot to catch a brew and watch a game, ask for Billy he's a great bartender and super friendly. Excellent food and calm environment to relax and eat. I recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I got the Caprese salad (best tomatoes I've ever had, super flavorful pesto, ok mozzarella), and my dining partners each got a pizza- eggplant pizza and the mushroom pizza was fontina, both of which I tried and loved. Service was excellent, water refills like clockwork...really, really impressed!  I am a total celebrity chef whore anyway, but this was legit good."}
{"text":"Very good unprenentious Vegas restaurant. Good Italian food in the middle of the Crystal shops/upscale mall. Open plan and good service. The pasta is good here and the value is decent compared to most overpriced places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident. I was alittle skeptical about this place (we've tried Puck's before and found it generally over-rated). We were pleasantly surprised! Although it was fairly empty, the ambiance, service, and menu compelled us to try this place. I had the Tuna burger. I have to say that it was the best Tuna burger that I've ever had. The flavor and rare cooking with perfect. It was served with \"promme frite\" fries cooked crispy and perfectly seasoned. I can only imagine with the beef burger tastes like. This place is a must if you're in the City Center located just outside Aria (skip Todd English's pub)!"}
{"text":"A VERY SOLID EXPERIENCE...  Cucina saved the day...on a crazy Saturday night in Las Vegas we booked another $$$$ restaurant, with the expectations that it would be as good as Friday's dinner...well Yellowtail at Bellagio really sucked...and we left hungry and frustrated that our (lofty) ideals for Vegas eating were not met.   So we decided to stroll through Bellagio and then in Vdara (to see a condo unit), and finally into Aria (and Crystals Mall at Aria) to shop...our tummies were grumbly and we were sore over dropping $200 on NOTHING, and so we went back to Cucina (we had been there last year), and were greeted immediately by a smiling hostess, seated right away, and got Tony as our waiter. We ordered two handcrafted pizzas, and chowed down...DAMN THEY WERE GOOD.  - One was Italian sausage, greens, and hot peppers. - The other was margherita, tomato, and basil.  Both were LIGHTS OUT GOOD.   - Service was fast. - Food was amazing. - It was a simple follow-up plan after an terrible $200 dinner.   Could not go wrong here and we ate for $40 and should have gone here in the first place. Oh well, live and learn in Vegas!  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and the asparagus was fantastic. Would eat here again in a heartbeat. Good service and reasonable prices for Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner while in Vegas. I would have given them 4 stars, but the service was inattentive.   I ordered the Fettucini Carbonara, which was fettucini with zucchini and pancetta in a cream sauce. The pancetta was very flavorful and brought a smoky flavor to the dish. The prices are a bit high for Italian food, but what do you expect for Vegas and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant."}
{"text":"Situated near the Aria gateway of Crystals, Wolfang Puck is pirched on the second level near Cartier & Harry Winston. They carry an all-day-everyday happy hour at the bar, and there's a variety of small plates and bigger dishes & cocktails ranging from $4-$16.  We decided to pass on the hh and split the eggplant and garlic spinach pizza with an add of chicken, $20. The mozzarella was light so the pizza didn't feel heavy to eat. The pieces of white meat chicken were delicious - perfectly seasoning with a subtle smoky flavor. The spinach, slightly crisp, had a mild garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering. While the eggplant was tender, it was a little watery and lacked seasoning. That would probably be my only complaint, in addition to perhaps wishing the pizza was a little crispier. Either way the pizza makes for a simple, delicious meal that's perfect for sharing.  Service was very nice. All of the staff was very attentive without hovering too much. Wolfgang makes a perfect stop to refuel between stores."}
{"text":"This might at first sound like a generic choice for lunch or dinner on the strip. However, it's not. Simple ingredients cooked well. I always enjoy eating here. There was a pizza we liked that had corn on it but they don't offer it anymore. Last time I had salmon and a side of cauliflower. Simple but cooked to perfection. I highly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Cucina! Our reservation was for 8:30 pm but we were already in the area around 7:30 & they were able to accommodate and seat our 8 person party at once! The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. I ordered off the prie fixe menu and highly recommend the artichoke bruschetta and salmon. Definitely grab dinner here if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"outstanding customer service.. however we did go too vegas for five hours only... lol anyways the pizza was great.. very big portions!!! just make sure you heat up the pizza before you eat it the next day .. haha.. the manager there was great.. he knows how too be a good host.. however he did steer us too a club that was closed...."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The food was outstanding; exceptional flavors. The bartender and our waiter were extremely friendly. The bread we were served was delicious. I love the prociutto pizza and the chocolate glazed hazelnut mousse. Scrumptious! Strongly recommended. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in 2 days! The food, drinks and service are great as well as the location. Definitely will be back on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"having only an hr or so to eat before we went clubbing, this place was close by to the Aria.  We sat at the bar for their HH.   We ordered pork belly- recommended by the bartender, one dish has 4 sticks, pretty good, well caramelized and yummy. these...mushroom ball things- they were okay. calamari- they were okay, I didn't like them that much, felt like I tasted the oil... the italian sausage pizza- kinda strange flavors...didn't really like it... the mushroom pizza- it was good, but maybe the flavors were standard and typical, so that's why i liked it.  overall, wasn't too impressed with what we had. one bartender (the one who sat us) was kind of rude. once he gave us our menus, he practically ignored us. yes he was making sangria, but that shouldn't be your priority. the other bartender Chris, was much nicer...a little weird, but had personality and tried to make convo.  Around $80? for 4 ppl. eh, i wouldn't be back...not really."}
{"text":"Very good! Great service! Great food! Decent prices $20-25 per entree! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the antipasti dish for 4 people: JUST DELICIOUS! Real Italian meat, cheese and vegetables. We order NY Strip, Spaghetti with meatballs and hamburger (actually only on lunch menu). The meat and the hamburger over the top. The Spaghetti a little over cooked and the sauce was too sweet, but the meatballs were perfect. The bill was really fair for so much quality"}
{"text":"First time here, we stopped in last night because there was a sign that said \"Happy Hour every Hour\"...Could not pass that up.  The Happy Hour menu has a few selection items of food and drink but there was a Grilled Cheese on there to die for...OMG, Amazing Cheese, Bacon, Avocado and Tomato on a crestless bread, just WOW...  I have never come across a bar that did not have Tuaca though.  For the massive bar they have here to not have a very popular alcohol was very odd to us.  None the less, the assorted cheese tray, the desert which like a turtle pie but WAY BETTER to the Grilled Cheese, it was a good time.  May go back again for happy hour another day, but for this trip, this place turned out to be ok.  It was a good choice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is very nice.  Crystal mall is very beautiful and this is one of the places to eat floating around the middle of the mall.  And considering that this place boasts the name of wolfgang puck and its surrounded by shops that sell shoes and hand bags for no less then 3000 dollars.  You might think its expensive but its not.   We got a pitcher of some wonderful pale in a nice round bottom pitcher.  An order of the fried calamari which was fantastic. and the proccuito pizza which was also very good but on the salty side.  the bill came out to around 50 dollars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ever since my first time coming here, I make sure to come here whenever I'm in the area.  The establishment itself is really clean and the decor is quite nice. They also play pretty good music here! Service is ok, the food tends to come out a bit slow, but it's not too bad. The best thing about this place is the food! It's pretty amazing. I honestly haven't had anything that I disliked here. My favorite dishes would be the calamari appetizer, lasagna, and the pasta with clams and garlic sauce. I've also tried the spaghetti and meatballs as well as the chicken piccata, both were pretty good. I tried the four cheese ravioli, it was good but it wasn't as good as I had expected it to be, so I probably wouldn't order that again.   This place would get a full 5 stars if they brought back the lasagna. Seriously, why would you guys take that away?!? That was the best lasagna I have ever eaten and it was the best thing on the menu! The ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was just perfect. I really miss it. Lasagna is such a staple item that I'm confused as to why it was taken away. So bring it back and I may bump up my rating."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 5 stars, on the basis of their accommodating and welcoming attitude to my 3 kids. However, the food and service has to be absolutely impeccable for such an accolade. It was very good mind you. BUT, I've had better crusts on wood-fired pizzas and much nicer fish and chips. That said, their wood-grilled salmon was lush (not sure why they choose Scottish over fabulous American alternatives - and I'm a Brit myself!) and everything was so fresh. They were charmingly flexible, when one member of our group wanted banana rather than berries on his ice cream, for example. I'm happy to continue eating here for the duration of our stay."}
{"text":"Nice place for a casual early dinner, if you don't want to get dressed up or want a pretentious atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and attentive but not overbearing. Food was great for the price. I had the Gnoochi and I am very picky about my Gnoochi. This was top notch in texture and flavor. The procuitto was great, a little difficult to eat but the flavor profile with the mozzerella was excellent. KP had the ravioli which was good, not spectacular but good nontheless. Recommended for a nice early dinner if you don't have reservations or don't want to spend 200 plus. Our check came out to just over 90 bucks including wine and desert. Tipped heavilly as the staff was great."}
{"text":"I've been home from vegas for a few days now, and I am still fantasizing about the lamb with fettuccine, and the goat-cheese stuffed peppers. 9 of us went to dinner for my cousins 21st celebration, and none of us left dissatisfied. We did the set family style menu. I could almost hear the grumblings from my sister, the worlds pickiest eater. Even she left happy. Sure, she didn't like the lamb or the goat cheese, but she said the ravioli and the chicken was to die for. What can I say, when I eat, I go for the weird stuff, not the stuff you can get anywhere. So I trust her judgement. One of our appetizers was an antipasti tray (its where the goat-cheese pepper came from ) and it was amazing. The meats, cheeses, and peppers were all beautifully prepared.   The service was good, nothing spectacular but overall very good. Our desserts came out disproportionately late...as in 45+ after our main course was cleared. And were not even offered coffee first. Additionally, I was a little weirded out by the location,,,I am not the biggest fan of feeling like I am in the middle of a mall (oh wait, I was). I think the ambiance could be a smidge better.   Overall, wonderful experience. I'd come back in the future, but by the time I get back out West, I will have another 30 restaurants I'd like to try first."}
{"text":"This establishment has lost a lot of its quality in terms of the food they serve. I used to come before and the establishment was much better with several other dishes that were delicious. Why they decided to remove them from the menu was beyond me. Their salmon was dry and the lemon sauce bland and watery, the desserts and appetizers did not impress me. Their chicken Parmesan, a simple staple in Italian cuisine, was dry and bland as well. This restaurant does not keep up with their competitors on the strip in terms of pricing and quality. The only upside was the service. Someone always came by to refill waters, check on our dishes, and they were always friendly. Though we only saw our actual service twice throughout the entire meal.."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The sangria was the only thing that I would rave about that we ordered. My salad was boring & pretty bland. My husbands pasta was really really salty. One of our friends also commented that her pasta dish was super salty. Wasn't the worst dining experience I've ever had. The place is decorated well & our server was great, the food just left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great place in Vegas to eat a great dinner, without spending a wad of cash! We had the following items:  Appetizers Tomato and pesto bruschetta- awesome pizza with onions, arugula, etc- awesome prosciutto and burreta cheese- good lettuce salad with gorgonzola- very good.  Entrees Osso bucco- excellent lamb- good"}
{"text":"New chef.  I've been here 20 times.  But probably won't come back.  Changed the carbonara/ why?   No one was there and cokes not refilled.  Lots of staff just hanging around talking to each other.  There were like seven in a group bee boping - yet cokes empty.   Just totally different.  I won't come back.  Management seems to not make the staff know customers are important.  Too many other options on the strip.  Sad sad sad cuz this was the place I ate every single first day I arrive in Vegas - both personal and business.   Just not anymore.  Maybe the staff knows the place is going down hill.  Again mr new chef, the old menu preparation was better.  My partners food was over cooked by the way.  The whole place was a let down after five years of constantly going there.  Very sad.  No more my go to place and no longer the place is take visitors.  Both dishes weren't even plated nicely. It was just put there on an oval plate, the proper way to serve an Italian dish like carbonara or spaghetti is in a bowl or shallow bowl.  Flat linguini on a flat plate.  Makes it like someone with no culinary experience did this.  The whole thing / meal didn't make sense. It was like before it was high end - now it's like silly run of the mill.  Service bad.  Meal bad.  Plating bad.   Four cubes of butter with bread where any wolf gang puck elegant meal would have like oil or some butter mixed with something to be special.   Nothing is special about this place anymore.    Again sad that after 20+ times of coming here I have no desire to return.  I've brought so many guests here too.    Bottom line - from elegant and special to run of the mill blah."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of Wolfgang's restaurants on the Strip, and this is ranked somewhere in the middle. Nothing remarkably memorable, but nothing that left a bad taste in my mouth either. We shared the octopus appetizer, prosciutto pizza, and the veal ravioli. All three were solid dishes-- the octopus was grilled nicely and packed a good punch with acidity and flavor, the prosciutto pizza had a good chewy crust and flavor, and the veal was tender and the ravioli itself had a good bite. The veal was definitely the highlight. We also got a fruity rum cocktail that was pretty good too.  If you are around the Crystals, a good option. Otherwise I wouldn't make this a destination stop."}
{"text":"Located inside the Aria I like the set up of the restaurant, simple yet classy. The gf likes it because they play old school black n white movies on one of the walls Service was great. They constantly came around to check up on us Ordered the caesar salad, pretty damn tasty. Ordered the fried calamari, they were flight and not heavy on the batter. Best calamari I've had. I enjoyed the green dipping sauce. Dont really know what it's made from, but it was good I ordered the veal ravioli with mushrooms. Pretty good, a bit salty but very filling GF ordered the lasagna. \"Feels homemade. This is how lasagna should be.\" Her words, not mine Was going to order the tiramisu but GF ran out of room. But I saw someone else ordered it and it had a side of chocolate dipping sauce. Looked good  Overall great experience. Kind of pricy, but it's expected from since we were in vegas. Randomly came to this place because we were getting hungry and chose this spot. Great gamble!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after walking around the CityCenter.  Do we have to ask for bread nowadays? This was the case here and other restaurants I visited during my recent trip to Las Vegas. However, the staff was still very attentive.   For appetizers we ordered the calamari \"fritto.\" Tasted great and loved the garlic aioli and the spice of paprika. For my entree I had the mozzarella panini with tomato soup and side salad. I loved that it came with all three. Honestly, you cannot have an italian restaurant without amazing, melt in your mouth, tomato soup. The soup was heavenly and tasted great paired with the panini. The side salad was great as well; however, some bits tasted a bit too... freshly picked? Well, you know what I mean. Considering we already had breakfast and this was just a, lets sit down my feet hurt  whimsical eat, we did not order dessert or anything after our entree. Overall, everything was delicious and I would definitely come back after a day of shopping."}
{"text":"You must come here to experience the ambiance. It's strange to be nestled in the middle of a mall and be struck by the architecture.   I loved my butter lettuce salad and caramelized onion pizza. The sweet iced tea my sister ordered (can't remember which flavor) was the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Adam was the best server!  So nice and really took care of us as we celebrated my parents' anniversary.    We ordered a glass of the Beringer Cabernet, a glass of Chianti, a Virgin Bloody Mary, two of the special tomato bruschetta, the sea bass, and the mushroom pizza with arugula instead of the hen egg.    Wow!!! Food was fantastic.  Loved the bruschetta...very refreshing.  The pizza was delightful as well.  I have been to Spago in Caesar's, Postrio (now closed) in the Benetian, and the Wolfgang Puck in the MGM l.  I usually like the MGm location but I think this is not my fav spot.  I like how it's great for people-watching but you get better service, a more chill ambiance, and, in my opinion, slightly better food.  Will be back! Thank you, Adam!"}
{"text":"We ordered the antipasti platter with various meats, cheeses, and marinated veggies.  We were talked into the grande, but the smaller platter would have sufficed.  Almost all of it was consumed post haste along with our wine and beer.   It was a wonderful way to start.  We had to request a child's menu for the tween in our party and she ordered the spaghetti noodles with butter and Parmesan cheese.   She enjoyed it.   For our main entree, we shared a chicken parmigiana.  It was fresh and tasty, and was plenty to share since it had two chicken breasts.  The only downside to the evening was the first batch of bread...   it came out burned on one side, and it was plated burned side down.  The waiter said it was supposed to be that way, but brought out new bread that want \"well done\". We enjoyed our visit and wouldn't hesitate to visit again when we want Italian food.    But with all the choices on the strip, there's not much here that leaves us with an urge to return."}
{"text":"Quetzi was the most amazing server!!! She is a true asset to Wolfgang's restaurant!!!  Margarita pizza, caprese, & bruscetta were delicious. Chocolate dessert was awesome presentation & decadent! Cozy setting."}
{"text":"Really beautiful place for lunch. The light comes through wonderfully in the Crystals shopping mall and this creates this wonderful open space. Love the modern design. Service was really top notch (the kind you would get at a $$$$ dinner) and the food was good. Ruben and I started with drinks - I got the Pineapple Ginger Mojito, refreshing, light, and delicious. We shared the Calamari served with marinara and pesto aioli. A tad salty, but the breading was lovely and the sauces were wonderful! Then we shared one of the wood-fired pizzas with spicy pepperoni, ricotta, Calabrian hot peppers, and oregano. The dough was delicious and I loved the crust on it, however, the toppings were not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. And I was torn between three selections. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu and it was fabulous! Definitely one of the best tiramisus I've had yet! The mascarpone cheese had little milk chocolate balls suspended in it and those added an unique texture to the delicate dessert. It was a wonderful experience and I definitely want to try other pizzas and maybe some pastas next time, however, I had to give it three stars right now since comparatively to other Italian or pizza joints, not my favorite execution."}
{"text":"This is more of a reflection on service than food. So, not impressed. They have no understanding of how to accommodate allergies and in no way made it easy. I had to spell it out for them and basically create my own dish based on the menu. For the price, I expected more.   I had to clarify about my food 4 times before getting it right. I asked for a suggested wine and was extremely disappointed.   In the end the food was good once we finally received it, but for what it is worth it was still a let down.   I expected 4 star from the reviews and instead it was as less efficient than red robin."}
{"text":"Came here for a relaxing dinner on a Tuesday night. The place was only about 50% filled so we were seated right away.   Our waitress was really great and came to our table right away to ask us about drinks. She also had what I like to call \"The Sense\" which is that she knows how often to check in rather than too much or too little. I've mentioned this before checking-in sense before in previous reviews. Overall she was great. The bus boy was also pretty on point about filling up our waters and bringing out bread. Service was A-OK.  As for food, the calamari w/ garlic aioli appetizer was definitely a good choice. Awesome to share between 3-4 people. Unfortunately, it was just me and my gf so we got a little bit filled up from it that we weren't fully hungry for our entrees. I ordered the pesto lamb which was tasty but just a little too salty for my taste. The mashed potatoes and spinach it comes with were really good though. She got the prime rib which she really enjoyed and I took a bit and it was legit.   Overall it was a good dining experience. Food was a little too salty for me and a little pricey for where we were but the service was good. No need to come back but a solid choice nonetheless."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The food, the people, even the drinks were perfect.  Edgar & Apollo were the best. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had two meals here during our stay. Both were very good. Sometimes with restaurants associated with well known chefs can kind of be hit or miss especially when said chef is not on the premise and has MANY restaurants nationwide. This location of Wolfgang Puck happily bucks this trend.  The kale salad is super yummy as is the antipasto salad (although I ate around the salami) we shared a pizza (basically because we had our eye on dessert) although you could pretty easily consume one all by yourself.  The tiramisu was very artfully plated and different than many preparations I have had.   The four cheese ravioli is really yummy as well. The wine/cocktail list is fun."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying I love wolfgang puck. My sister and I always enjoy going to the one at the MGM when we visit Vegas. This last trip, however, we stayed at the aria and tried this location out. It was the worse experience I've ever had. We had just drove in from Orange County, so we had on some comfy active wear(I mention this because it felt like they were judging our outward appearance). Right when we walked in we were given dirty looks by the staff. It took a few minutes for us to even be acknowledged and seated, when the entire restaurant had roughly 3 tables filled. Once seated it took over 15 minutes for our waiter to come over. He had the snootiness demeanor that I've ever encountered. Not once we're we approached with a smile or warm disposition. Each waiter that passed by our table was looking at us like we have 2 heads. We felt extremely uncomfortable and by the time our food came we requested to eat it in our rooms. I don't know what is wrong with the staff here, but they need a lesson in customer service. I will never return to this location again and advise others to do the same. This happened over a month ago and I'm still upset with how poorly we were treated."}
{"text":"Went here to eat before hitting the club and cant say I have ever had better egg plant pizza. Didn't sound to good but after taking that first bite, WOW!!!!  The bruschetta was very very good and so was the free bread.  The service wasn't so great. Our server had a big party so he never checked up on us. Which I understand if you get a big party but dont forget about your other tables.   The bussers were more helpful. Always asked if we were doing ok and serving us water.  Other than That it was really good for.  Definitely will return again!"}
{"text":"Oh ma ma! Lip smacking delicious. We ordered a cheese platter and it was well laid out and contained a good mix of aged and new cheese. I ordered the mussels starter and it was delicious. Delicate flavored handled to perfection. My husband ordered a pizza and that too delivered on taste. A lovely goodbye Vegas meal. Now I will look for a local restaurant in my city ...  Visit 2 was on a my brother in laws 50th birthday !! The amazing food which was flavored delicately was a hit with our palette. Ryan our server went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. He was patient in explaining the food and its ingredients. So glad we came back here. Thanks Ryan you made our day!"}
{"text":"The absolute worse meal I had in a restaurant in years.  EPIC BAD  Had pizza here once before and the place was quite good. It was clean and had friendly service.    After my last stop, I will never eat here again.  In a party of three, we order apps and simple dishes.  Again, the waiter was very friendly, that was the high point.  The apps were ok, nothing special.  The main meal was HORRENDOUS.  The absolute worse meal I can ever remember having out.  The dish was spaghetti and meatballs.  It is the most basic dish one can serve.  Any beginner can serve a half decent dish of it.  It started off with the staff handing one member in our party their meal 15 minutes before they served our meal (one person ordered the same thing). The meal was cold, the spaghetti overcooked and the sauce was can quality.  It was basically eating Franco American spaghetti from a can but 10 times worse.  The meal was sent back and another attempt at it was made.  The same exact dish came out.  It seemed like the spaghetti was sitting in water for a 1/2 hour, it could literally break apart in pieces tapping it with a fork.  My meal had the same exact problem.  I asked the hostess if I could speak to her manager and she told me she's in the back and I'll call her.  She never answered and she told me she probably left for the night.  I sportingly paid my whole bill even though they should have paid me to eat there.  I called again the next day and asked to speak to the manager to tell them how atrocious their place is and how I never want to see any customer served that rot, I was put on hold and hung up on.  The cowardly manager didn't even have the class to answer their phone.  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Service was so slow that I got up and got a pitcher and filled up all four of our glasses.  Then, we got the bill and the wine wasn't discounted.  When we inquired he said it was bottles only.  When we asked where it says that (see pic) he said it doesn't. He gave us the wrong change for the bill we paid cash for. The neighbors bill also had to be sent back.  The food was ok but the service was unacceptable. I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck has never disappointed me. I try to hit up a Puck restaurant whenever I'm in Vegas. We were there celebrating my birthday finally & after reading so many Italian restaurant reviews, chose Cucina. Nice ambiance, I'm big on people watching, especially in Vegas, & being located in the Crystals shops gives you a good view, without being super noisy or close to people. We had this delicious squash bruschetta, chicken piccata, & braised short ribs. But the star of the evening was our server Tony. You know the one, he's Yelp-famous.. :) With his recommendations & attending to our needs, he really was spot on with everything & what a nice experience it was to have him serve us! In Vegas, with so many different restaurants, when you pair great quality of food with terrific service, that's when you have a standout place. Check out Cucina, make sure you request Tony. :)"}
{"text":"After our first long day on the strip,we were starving. Wolfgang has never disappointed me at any of his locations. The Food and service were both amazing. Fresh baked crusty bread to start,calamari, octopus, spaghetti, and the chicken piccata were all delicious. Service is perfect and friendly. I made reservations early to get a nice romantic table. This place can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. The table next to us was seated after us, but got their food 10 minutes before we did. They offered a Prix Fixe lunch menu. Calamari was very over cooked. Too much time between courses for a lunch."}
{"text":"In the beautiful Crystals shopping center. We tried a couple pizzas that were excellent. The Italian sausage with red pepper and basil was a nice mix of tastes. The service was excellent. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We stopped for an early light lunch. Their all  day happy hour is a great choice. The Nduja Crostini was excellent and unique. All the happy hour menu items are 7$ or less. Great deal. Nice open air decor. Very friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner the night and was pleasantly surprised as this is a chain!  Started off with the butter lettuce that Yelpers suggested and it was fresh, light and tasty! The waiter made my salad a half order as apparently others eat this as an entree?!?  The ribeye this year was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The mushroom topping did help out the flavoring!  The broccolini was also decent, fresh and flavorful as well!  Service was okay, on par with a chain Americanized restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Bartenders professional and very friendly, the bar is well stocked with a wide variety of poison. Deaths door gin is definitely a must try for gin lovers.   Food here is amazing, the happy hour items are very reasonable and the entrees are well priced for Vegas.  I have no idea what it is but Crystals and this open air bar delight the sense with a perfumed but subtle smell, its delicious.  If you're in the area and hungry, this is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"First night here at Vegas and to celebrate anniversaries and engagment so friends and I wanted to go to a \"classy\" fancy restaurant. Searched and searched around for a good restaurant and finally decided to just go to this place since it is a branch of the Wolfgang Puck chain of restaurants. This place is located in the Crystals shopping area and it was fairly quiet because it was proabably a Wednesday night. Got seated and the menu isn't big, but had a good variety. Waitress was very helpful and so were the people refilling our water. My friend wanted the water with no ice so they always accomodated every time she needed a refill. I ordered Ravioli with wild mushroom, husband ordered Salmon with rosemary, friends ordered some pasta dish. The dishes were not big, but it was good although mine was a little bit on the salty side. Overall, good service, good location and good food except for the salty part."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Food tastes great. Staff is welcoming and the music is chill. We ordered antipasti boards which supplemented our wines well. We ordered some pasta with chicken parm which was delicious. They have 3 course meal for 35 bux for dinner which is awesome"}
{"text":"First about the service...  My wolfpack went to Brasserie PUCK for dinner the Saturday we were in Vegas. We unfortunately were running late for our reservation & arrived 45 minutes after we were supposed to at 9:45 to a nearly empty restaurant. We assumed we wouldn't have any trouble with our table, so when we were told by the hostess that she'd have to check with a manager to see if we could be sat, we were rather shocked. After we were told that we could finally sit, a couple behind us were told that they were closed. Really? 10 p.m. on a Saturday night in Vegas where everything is open 24/7?  Hm, but maybe there's a lesson in all of this and my dear, dear wolfpack that I love so so very much won't run so late anymore?  But I digress.    I guess we shouldn't be surprised since the hotel was pretty empty too.  I have never seen a hotel/casino so empty on the Vegas strip on a Saturday night.  Once we got passed that frustration, we were greeted by some awesome servers. Like, nearly all of the ones working that night.  Super fun & friendly, but it also seemed like they had nothing better to do?   Now about the food... Us wolves weren't so hungry due to the large feast we had for lunch, so we all only ordered entrees.  We all ordered: 1) Italian meat pizza (according to my friends, not very good) 2) Rigatoni carbonara (I think it was rigatoni... delish, according to friends) 3) Ahi with asparagus & potatoes (I ordered this - very good ahi... though I like mine better :P  The asparagus and potatoes were cooked and seasoned nicely.) 4) Salmon, again with asparagus & potatoes (according to my friend, delicious)  Except for the lone wolf that ordered the pizza, I think we would all agree that we would order our food again.  The mixed drinks 2 of the members of my wolfpack ordered were awesome.  I ordered a pinot grigio with my other wolf - it complemented our meals very nicely. Oh - and the bread was good, too.  We would all definitely eat here again, if it's still there when we go next.  Hopefully City Center starts to pick up in business, because it was a gorgeous hotel/casino & it has some fantastic restaurants!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They may have been understaffed, but people were just standing around. We ran out of water and never got refilled even when we asked.  Good was delicious and amazing. If we had to go back it would purely be for the food - maybe takeout?? That would avoid the negatives and get all the positives."}
{"text":"NEED MORE STARS! The place was off the hook! Lets start with the ambience, nice & cozy for dinner while still being open enough for people watching (my favorite pass time). The service was lovely, our server was VERY educated, he knew everything there was to know about the menu & all the ingredients on it to the way each dish was prepared. The bruschetta was the best I've ever had. The olive oil they used was DELICIOUS with a slight sweetness. For my entree I had the fried eggplant, the best I've ever had as well. It was flash fried & then baked which creates absolute perfection, no oily or mushiness which is usually the issue with eggplant dishes. My aunt had the Veal ravioli with brown butter & sage. She thoroughly enjoyed it, I don't eat veal so I didn't try it, but I tasted one of the mushrooms so I could taste the sauce.... Phenomenal! I will definitely be returning here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for refreshments while waiting for our Dream Racing pick-up. I opted for ginger ale to prep my stomach for the oncoming fast driving! My friend had a west coast IPA to pass the time. Aesthetic was trendy with video projection on the surrounding walls. Only down side was our bartender disappeared for a bit so we had to snag the busboy to request we get a check sorted out to not be late for our pick-up."}
{"text":"Well from the taste of the food, you can definitely tell this place was created by a chef.  I looked at the menu to review what I had, but I don't even know the name of the starter I ordered. Well, the menu doesn't really go by a \"name\" instead they just list out what the dishes are, which is kinda nice for the non-bilingual.  For the starter.. It was just a pile of mozzarella with what looked like uncooked bacon with green seasoning ontop. Wasn't really a fan of the fatty meat, but the cheese was good all on its own.  Now for my meal. The Panini: Mozzarella, Basil Pesto, Insalata Mista, Creamy Tomato Soup - I had NO idea what Insalata Mista was, but apparently it's a salad. It was so YUMMY! I thought the prices of these would be outrageous but I was completely wrong. My Panini was a reasonable $16.   The staff was so kind, and the place is gorgeous. There's not one thing I can complain about... Here's a 5!"}
{"text":"Okay.. I may be slightly on the generous side but the food just totally won me over!   Went to Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party and decided to go here for our bachelorette dinner!   AMBIANCE- 4 stars! FOOD- 5 stars! SERVICE- 5 stars!  Ambiance was nice and simple, very open and modern. Hard to give it a 5 star because my other favorite restaurant Mon Ami Gabi over at Paris is hard to top. But this was a very schnazzy and fun place to have dinner.   The food can't even compete! Because it was pool day the next day, my friend and i decided to split the clam linguine. Which seriously was sooo good. Everyone else's was drool on myself good as well! The grilled chicken, chicken carbonara, and the rib eye steak that I got to taste from each of my friends plate made me wish there was an entree sampler... which I could have ALL TO MYSELF! Loved  everything!  Service was great! Waiters and waitresses were accomodating and very friendly! For the bachelorette party, we had a scavenger hunt going where we had to find certain guys to pose or do certain things and all of them were ethusiastic and completely on board. One guy was all about it and even went the extra mile. (Thought to myself: okay dude, thanks but realllly thanks now ok? lol)   Overall, loved the food and will definitely be back to share the experience with more people!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and enjoyed the best negronis . Service was excellent and the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant a shoutout for their amazing food, staff, and experience! I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday last night and our server was Tony he was amazing and made our dining experience unforgettable! Thank you to Tony and to the chef's that made my moms birthday very special we had an amazing time and I can't wait to go back and get Tony as our server!"}
{"text":"Insieme a 'Spago' un buon esempio di cucina italiana all'estero! Pasta a cottura decente e sugo di pesce leggermente piccante che si fa mangiare volentieri! Inoltre in entrambi i locali, con Yelp si ha uno sconto del 20% un ottimo binomio!"}
{"text":"Prosciutto Pizza? Almost as good as it sounds. The cut is kinda thick and the prosciutto covers the whole pizza. The Mascarpone Cheese base was my favorite part of the pizza.  The sausage pizza my dad got was amazing. And my wife's ricotta gnocchi (yes gnocchi made with ricotta instead of potatoes!) was incredible."}
{"text":"Before heading out to the airport, we decided to check out Cucina by Wolfgang Puck for lunch. An open restaurant with nice clean modern decor in the Crystal shops near Aria. Only a few patrons for lunch today, the hostess sat us quickly and the waitress came quickly and offered is water immediately after we sat down. We decided on the wild mushrooms and hen egg pizza ($17) and the Papardelle pasta ($22) after looking at Yelp reviews and recommendations by the waitress. The food took a while to come out, I'd guess 15 minutes, which is a bit long especially since there weren't many other customers in the restaurants.  Anyways, when the food came out, I was surprised by the portion. The pizza was a 10-inch pizza but most places that offer pizza on the menu is this puny sized a bit bigger than your hand pizza but this one was huge! Maybe 6 good sized slices. The pappardelle portion was pretty big too. My pizza was  in one word, amazing. The pizza was like paper thin and the crust was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms, braised leeks, and fontina and taleggio cheese were rich and delicious. The hens egg (albeit a bit dry looking) was cooked okay so I could slice the egg and the yolk spilled out into the pizza. Altogether the bite was very tasty, with the richness and earthiness of the mushrooms and egg with the right balance of the salty cheese. Next the pappardelle was very impressive. Hand-made and cooked to order (as per the waitress), the pasta was very silky and tasted fresh. The marinara was alright to me but altogether, a fine pasta. After the disaster of last night's crap dinner at another name chef's restaurant (a dude famous for Creole), I was impressed and satisfied at this chef's restaurant. I'd definitely try again! 4/5 stars only because despite having quality and tasty food with good service, it was only pizza and pasta. Nothing inventive and outrageously delicious."}
{"text":"Happy hour all day everyday at the bar...now that's what I'm talking about! Thanks to Misti Y's fantastic review we bellied up to the bar and were very happy! $5 pints/$14 pitchers of assorted beers including Negroni and Hoegaarden!!! There is also a nice selection of not-so-small plates...we had the Insalata Mista ($5) which they so very nicely split into two plates for us without our even asking. We also had the artichoke hearts which were lovely. Our bartender was amazing. The bar was packed but she never missed a beat, she even kept our pitcher of beer in the fridge so it didn't get warm. Great experience and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Bruschetta was so simple and fresh. The rigatoni was incredible and satisfied my pasta craving! The zeppole was so creamy and amazing in the caramel sauce. Great spot. Get Tony as your waiter!"}
{"text":"For the price, I was expecting to get wowed. Went in here with really high expectation as the Name and the prices are both on the high end. Ordered the Salmon which was good but nothing to rave about. We also ordered the Chicken dish but it wasn't really all that good. There was nothing in that dish to tie the chicken dish together. The plate just showed up with two pieces of chicken thighs. If the server would have informed us then we would have ordered some mashed potatoes to go with it instead of garlic bread. All in all I was really disappointed with this place. The server hardly showed up to our table as well."}
{"text":"Cucina was absolutely fantastic for our bachelorette party dinner!  With a group of 21 ladies, I was worried about prices and making sure everyone would be happy with the menu; however, our experience here surpassed all my expectations!  While I don't remember our server's name (maybe Tim or Tom??), he was absolutely fantastic!  The choices for wine, cocktails, apps, and main courses ended up being perfect and our server was extremely helpful when it came to ordering enough small plates that would satisfy our large party.   The location was perfect as we were staying at the Cosmo, and the one thing that really stood out for me was that there was no need to make a deposit prior or meet a required minimum upon dining.  That was the only issue I found with other restaurants since we were such a large group.  After having 4 bottles of wine, mixed drinks, a handful of apps, a main entree, and some dessert/coffee, our final cost was about $1600 - not bad at all for a group our size!    Organizing big group dinners can be a challenge, and Cucina was truly outstanding.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of Wolfgang puck but i wanted some Italian and this place was the only one open at the time within 0.3 miles lol (yes, I don't like to walk very far).  sat at the bar so we could get the happy hour menu.  ordered chicken wings from there.  $6 for 6 pieces of wings. omg so good!  wings were tender and juicy.  for the entree, I wasn't too hungry so we split a crispy egg plant parmesean with spaghetti noodles on the side.  this dish was also very good!  one complaint is that if you order this, get the egg plant on the side to it'll stay crispy.  they were so nice to split the plate for us.  oh yeah I wanted some type of meat so added chicken to the entree.  $5 for like 6 slices of chicken.    overall,  cute place and great food!  THOSE HAPPY HOUR WINGS THO :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack before our concert and I'm happy we did.  It was happy hour at the bar and I got to see the Red Sox beat the Yankees! Our bartender was awesome, even though he's a Yankees fan! We had the meatball pizza, a glass of red sangria and a good size cheese and meat plate and it was only $29.  What a deal.  The meatballs were so good.  The only suggestion would be to add something sweet, like honey or fruit spread to the cheese plate.    I would def like to go back to order off the full menu someday."}
{"text":"Food is very consistent and excellent.  The staff is great and the bartenders are the best.  I highly recommend this restaurant if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"What can you say about Wolfgang Puck. The presentation is wonderful without being pretentious. Flavors that never ever over power. Very good wine selection. Try the pappardelle."}
{"text":"Came to grab a late lunch to-go on a Monday, June 11, 2012.  I was warmly greeted at the door by the hostess and manager.  I asked if I could get an order to go, and they said I could at the bar.  I didn't take pics, so my memory is a bit elusive... but I remember it being very well-lit, and modern.  It matched the space of the Crystals shopping center.  It was very lively, and I was surprised there were so many patrons at that hour (around 2pm).  I got the spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the grilled meatballs.  My friend, Arvin T, had been searching for the \"best meatball,\" and so I joined him in his search.  I was very tempted to have a cocktail, having glanced a number of tasty looking handcrafted cocktails... next time!  I forget how long the bartender said the wait would be, and I had made a note in my phone (only to have deleted it, it seems)... but I remember it taking 3-4 minutes longer than he said.  Which was fine for me, but for those that are nit-picky...  Fast forward, I'm sitting on the couch in Veer Towers (that's why I chose to get it to go -- it was 8 minutes flat, from bar to doorstep), with Mad Men on Netflix... I dig into the spaghetti... it's cooked al dente, thumbs up.  I take a bite of the meatball -- my teeth sink through more easily than anticipated; it's a very soft texture, and I don't like it.  On top of that, it was surprisingly sweet tasting, not in a good way.  Disappointed, I wash it down with water, and give it a second go.  Same disappointment.  I open up the grilled meatballs and cross my fingers... The texture is more firm, like I'm used to.  However, this time it's way too salty!  I quickly grab the water, rinse, and repeat.  Salty!  Deja Vu.  Einstein's attributed quote came to mind: \"Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"  (He didn't really say that btw, but who knows who came up with it).  When my friend came home from work that day, I had saved him well over half (probably 3/4).  He tried it, and disagreed with me about the grilled meatballs being salty... only to recant his statement 4 hours later when he admitted he needed to drink lots of water at dinner.  Wolfgang Puck, your meatballs let me down that day.  But, being as sleek looking as you were, I will return to sample your handcrafted cocktails anyway ;)"}
{"text":"Got the brick chicken, squid ink linguine, beef ragu and the kid pizza.    First off, the kid pizza is huge almost enough for two kids.    The brick chicken is excellent.  Tender meat and unique flavor.  Could use a bit more salt but thats my personal preferance.    The pastas are very good as well."}
{"text":"I love being in the area of this restaurant.  It just speaks luxury. And this place is in a perfect location.  Awesome Christmas tree was right in view. Stunning. Wish I felt the same excitement for the restaurant itself.  Now, it wasn't bad.  The food was quite good.  We actually went in to get something quick and non-filling, like a nice salad.  I found on the menu a Kale Salad.  It was good, but for 14 bucks, it wasn't THAT good.  And my uncle's 11 dollar bowl of soup simply was not worth the price.  Given all of that, our servers, though nice and friendly, were just not the most attentive waiters.  It took too long to arrive, take our orders and then return.  And this was only during the middle of the day.  It really wasn't that busy. But everyone seemed to be doing quite a bit of running around. Nice place but could use some improvements in customer service, IMO."}
{"text":"It was an okay experience. Service was great. Felt like it was overpriced. Someone in my party got ravioli and there was only 7 on the plate. I got a pizza and it was good. I might come back again to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and ordered from the pre fix menu. I was able to try the bruschetta, shrimp scampi, margherita pizza, papardelle bolognese, and donuts with caramel sauce (sorry, I forgot the proper name for these). Everything was good enough, but I didn't have anything spectacular. While we visited around 2pm, the restaurant was pretty empty but the service was still very slow."}
{"text":"The only reason this place receives 4 stars is because of the service.  The food was amazing enough to make up for the terrible service we received, which would've earned 2 stars.  We had a reservation and were seated quickly, but things went downhill from there.  Once we ordered the food took an absurdly long time to come out, so long that various waiters/waitresses came to reassure us that our food was coming and to apologize for the wait.  We said it was okay, but we were all actually starving and getting impatient.  Once the food finally came, it was delicious, and we forgot about how long it had taken to get there.  Because of the time it had taken to get our orders out, they brought us two free desserts (a cookie plate, and fresh cream filled donuts).  Both were delicious (especially the donuts), but also took forever to arrive!  I believe we ended up in the restaurant for somewhere around 2 hours between all of the waiting.  I was surprised at the lack of service this restaurant had, but very impressed with all of the food."}
{"text":"Nice service from everyone.  Brussels sprouts were well done alone with other winter veggies. Sea bass portion was on smaller side and cooked ok. Never had a bad pasta dish here. Not sure if its fresh pasta but it takes like it."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at the worst table...lovely server saved the experience and she gets the star.  Honest to God, we were sat at a table behind a big structural pillar and were completely forgot about.  Long wait for really not great cuisine.  Expect more from a Puck restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great, no issue there. Service was absolutely horrible!! Restaurant was not busy at all. Spent 5 hours there with an old friend, drinking wine & catching up. I gave the waiter a very generous tip which he DID NOT deserve!! $35 on a $112  check. Had to beg the entire time to refill our water, tea, ice for the warm wine,,, etc.. no salt & pepper on the table. Ordered a pizza & would have liked red Chile flakes for but he never came by. Never checked on us or asked if we needed anything. Then we decided to order more wine which my friend paid for. So we opened a new check. You would think after he got his tip he would have changed his attitude. Nope! Keep having to ask the busboy, who was nice, to get our waiter. Mind you as I said the Restaurant was not busy so I don't know what we were keeping him from. I work Front Desk at one of the largest properties. I rarely go out on the strip, but when I do I am so sad to receive such shitty service! Would never treat our guests as such! You are the reason locals don't want to go out on the strip, and the reason why guests are reviewing Vegas as very expensive with a mediocre experience! Get your service together or get another job.   Wolfgang I lived here 23 years and always loved & patronized your restaurants. I HATE when guests tell me they will never return to our hotel. But I have to say I am feeling the same way. Absolutely disgusted with the way we were treated today!!"}
{"text":"Note: This review was based on a wonderful Happy Hour Experience  Wolfgang Puck Pizzaria & Cucina offers a great \"ALL-DAY Happy Hour! It's located in the famous Crystall Gallery Shopping Center, which is a great attraction itself!  In this Gallery Styled, high-end Shopping Mall, WPPC also has an aesthetic appeal with eye pleasing, modern, inviting setting. The serving staff, especially the barkeeps were friendly, humorous and efficient.  WPPC has a large, comfortable bar (S Steel) with a partial view of the beautiful mall. One of its tv's over the bar counter is a thin-glass projection type, which looks like a piece of art! The restaurant is moderate in size, but has a spacious feel with its modern, comfortable tables and lounges. Those by the windows overlook the gorgeous gallery shopping area below.  One evening in late March, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves tremendously over 2 glasses of house red wine ($7@), a draft beer ($5), a Spicy Pepperoni Pizza ($14), and a plate of assorted Marinated Olives ($7), which was much bigger in size than we expected. We came for HH only and did not try the dinner menu.  - For its nice ambience, good food, and attractive location, we were not surprised to see quite a few locals there, at the bar that evening! The Crystal Gallery Shooping Center and the WPPC will defintely be one place we'll bring our out-of-town guests to for a good time!  Additional Info - Go visit this fabulous Crystal Center, even if you don't eat/drink at WPPC! - Crystall Shopping Center itself has a modern, artistic architecture with unique aesthetic design, totally worth a visit for tourists and locals alike! This mall is like a gallery with beautiful sculptures, fountain tubes, ornate staircases.... To get to the mall, one can ride the free CityCenter Tram, from Bellagio to the Crystall stop, or to the Aria/Monte Carlo stop, from where then walk around to visit a couple of NICE galleries (Glass Blowing by Chihuly; Sculptures by McDonald) along the way; followed by walking on the picturesque overpass/footbridge to the Mall.  My wife and I spent a pleasant afternoon walking in the CityCenter - the Aria, the galleries, the Crystall Shopping Center, and happily ended our wonderful evening at the Wolfgang Puck over good food and drinks!  Peterskis, Apr 2012"}
{"text":"Food is just what we expected, great! The service was super slow!   We just happened to hit this restaurant on a Friday night and they got slammed right after we ordered drinks. They said it was due to surrounding events that caused them to be unusually busy. It took way too long for us to get our drinks and that was right before the major rush hit.  The atmosphere was casual and a bit on the noisy side. Very brightly lit! It is in the middle of a main shopping area. Kind of fun for people watching. I didn't care for my Moscow Mule cocktail. I sent it back. Not sure how they make theirs and couldn't keep the waiter long enough to find out, but they replaced it with another drink. We understood how busy it was, but the waiter didn't even try to explain and or apologize. Nor check back with us on how our food was. We had to ask for the manager. They did comp one of our beers for the wait. We had Alfredo, Pizza and Eggplant. All of which were delicious!   We recommend Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria! Just check to see how busy they are before you sit down! Vegas can be so unpredictable!"}
{"text":"The food here was incredible. Wolfgang Puck does an excellent job blending flavors that result in a delicious, interesting, and truly mastered meal. The food was light, but incredibly satisfying and the service was perfect."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. No reservation necessary since every time slot was available. Ordered the boar ragu and the seafood pasta, both of which were OK. Have had better homemade pasta unfortunately at other establishments. Service also left something to be desired. Great effort was required to get our server's attention. Also no complimentary bread, which is why we ordered a side of garlic bread. Yet upon leaving, we noticed multiple tables with bread baskets, so not sure what that was about. Otherwise, it was A-OK."}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck at Crystals! Good food, Nice spot and Nice staff :)   Entrees ranges to $20-40 which is not bad, Pasta around $17-30 ! Good price for a delicious meal. My favorite meal so far in this restaurant is the Carbonara cause they used Pancetta instead of the regular bacon and The Lasagna!"}
{"text":"They have an excellent prix fixe menu that is delicious and well priced. You will leave satisfied. Monday's and Wednesday's it is half off bottles of wine!! The service is incredible. Our waiter Javier was amazing even after I had an issue with one of the meals I didn't realize had meat in it!! Great meal in Vegas on a budget. Food was top notch."}
{"text":"We were really looking for just a snack to hold us over for a late night dinner reservation. We were pleasantly surprised with the food, drinks, and service.   We had the Mushroom pizza, frito misto, and tiramisu. The pizza was definitely my favorite but the Frito was fantastic as well. Is there really anyone that doesn't like Tiramisu? You won't be disappointed with the dessert as well if you have room for it! Nice spot with great food and Tony took great care of us."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this dinner. Staff is super attentive and my water glass was never empty. The food was delicious though it took a very long time to get our entree.   We grabbed the set menu for $35 and tried the proscuitto, octopus salad (apps) - these were EXCEPTIONAL. Do order it.   Entree was the salmon and rib eye, both very well done. Rib eye was a bit chewy but still tasty!  To end it off we got the tiramisu and the donut holes. Which was the cherry on top. Everything was so good. Oh did I mention I got the white sangria? So fresh and delicious, it's a must."}
{"text":"Tony was our waiter and he really made us feel so special! We were VIP for the evening and couldn't have been happier. Food was amazing. We tried the piccolo cheese board, rigatoni, sausage pizza (with an egg! You're a baby if you're not into egg on pizza!), and the rib eye special. Highly recommend. We loved everything and the California Cabernet we enjoyed with the meal. Tony guided us in our menu picks and was spot on. He also comped us the most delish dessert ever - fresh hot zeppolis! We are from NY and consider ourselves zep connoisseurs. These were fantastic.  Also loved the bus waiter. Such a gentleman. 20% off if you check in on yelp. Though you'll gladly tip the waitstaff the savings. Check it out."}
{"text":"There was nothing I didn't like about the experience. We started our meal off with the bruschetta which was topped with delicious marinated tomatoes. Then I had the citrus marinated beet salad with goat cheese. Divine! Best salad that I have ever had! My partner had the radish cucumber salad which he said was a little plain (thus only 4 stars). Now for the incredible entrees... I had eggplant Parmesan which was simply incredible, it was served with a pasta which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy, garlicky. Yummy! My partner had the rigatoncini with Piemontese meat sauce and he said it was delicious! And to top it off, our drinks were perfectly made each time.  We didn't order any speciality cocktails but stuck with out favorites; a greyhound and Jack and Coke.  Of course, I must mention the service... I was satisfied. Food came out at a nice pace and everybody was friendly and polite.  I highly recommend this place especially if you're staying anywhere near Crystals high end shopping mall."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour with my gf and a coworker... we were hoping to get a quick bite to eat before going back to work.   We sat down and the bar top was filthy... crumbs and goo leftovers all over it. Nobody came to greet us and we sat there for 8 minutes when we decided to leave.   I have eaten here before and I know that being dirty is not the norm but the food has never been great... its only convenient since I work nearby...   the service yesterday, the dirty restaurant and blah food in general means I wont give them another try for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"This review is only for their happy hour, which is essentially all day.  We got here at 12:30pm and there was no one at the bar. We were intrigued by the \"all day\" happy hour which is either not really a happy hour anymore or it's a happy day. Which one is it? Hmmm...  We ordered the chicken wings ($7) which were very crispy and who doesn't like crispy wings? I was a big fan of the negroni and I should've kept ordering that. I decided to switch it up and order the Moscow mule next and was not a fan of it. It tasted mostly like ginger beer with no vodka at all.  My girlfriend ordered both their red and white sangrias and she was not a fan of either. I tried it and we agreed that they were both overly carbonated with too much soda. That seems like a trend with some of the carbonated drinks here.  We ended our meal with the tiramisu hoping that it could salvage our experience with the food here but it didn't help. Overall it's just a meh happy hour and you can probably find better options in Vegas."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars for the food but the service and atmosphere were lacking.  I think we saw the Wolfgang Puck name and expected something more, when the reality is he probably slaps his name on many Vegas establishments.  We rarely saw our waiter and it truly felt like we were dining in the middle of the mall.    That said, the lasagna was good, as was the brick chicken with grilled corn and pancetta.  The fried calamari could have been cooked a bit longer (was very pale colored) but was served with delicious sauces (tomato sauce and pesto aioli).  If you're looking for something casual, you'll probably enjoy the food.  If you're looking for a nice night out, there are hundreds of other nice restaurants to choose from on the strip."}
{"text":"This is the only place inside Crystals at City Center that I can afford to indulge in. We took a break from window shopping (the only thing you can really do at the stores here), and had a really nice lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria. The ultra modern restaurant is open and airy, located in the middle of the mall.   While no one in our group of four ladies was particularly starving, we just got three things to share. I guess the motivation behind that was the skin tight size XS dress that was waiting to be worn a few hours later. So, we ordered the fried calamari appetizer, one basil pesto grilled chicken panini and the calzone pizza which we had them make as an open faced flat pizza. They were kind enough to cut the panini into fours, and surprisingly, we still had leftover pizza! Loved the delicious panini, and the thin crust pizza was very tasty. The calamari was nicely fried and not oily at all.  Service was top notch here. I'm really starting to notice the high level of hospitality in Vegas, which is pretty refreshing. Will definitely be back to do do some casual dining when I'm staying at Vdara. The bar area is also super swank with TVs projected onto a piece of glass. Nice job, Wolfie."}
{"text":"Service and drinks were great. Food was horrible. My pasta tasted like it came out of a can."}
{"text":"We were craving pizza and this hit the spot. It was light and delicious with really fresh ingredients. Plus, I liked that the ambience, liquor etc was nice for dinner - pizza restaurants can be hit or miss that way. Also got the Kale Salad and Bruschetta and both we're yummy! Service was good and prices are reasonable. There was more we want to try so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Dropped by for great bar food (Calamari, assortment of Pizzas, Wings) and drinks, all of which, were delicious. There is that \"Wolfgang Puck\" twist on every dish and cocktail. Joanna, our server, had great recommendations, and was spot on with customizing our drinks. She deserves 5 Stars for service alone!! Love this hidden gem at Crystals Shops near Aria/Vdara."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance and our server Bryce is super helpful and friendly. I got the \"pork steak\" which turned out to a pork cutlet, but the flavor is great. It taste similar to BBQ Vietnamese pork. We also got the Pappardelle, which was perfect."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing! My waiter, Apollo, took very good care of us. Always attentive and so very pleasurable. Would definitely come back! This is what you look for ! Thank you, Apollo."}
{"text":"It's like my mind is playing tricks on me lately I could of sworn that you are still my baby I'm on a merry-go-round Going around, driving me crazy at...WP Pizzeria! - Jay Sean (lights off)  I needed a 'safe' meal that was close to me that wouldn't be too heavy since I was playing in a world series event the next morning. WP restaurants have always been good to me and a vegetarian pizza seemed like a great idea. I really like the atmosphere of this place since its in an open area and very bright, compared to so many dimly lighted places all around vegas.   I ordered the mushroom pizza which came with thyme and arugula (finished every bit of it). My initial reaction when I saw it was that it was such a big portion. The pizza wasn't greasy and the cheese wasn't overwhelming either. The caesar salad with chicken looked appetizing as well but took a while to come out. I really wanted to save room for dessert because they had something called a zeppole that was supposed to be a delight but I just couldn't do it.   P.S. Service was definitely a highlight here!  Food: 4 stars --- Service: 5 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): n/a"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Even better with family and friends in a corporate event.  Tony and staff were very attentive to our large group."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place! Went to dinner with my family and friends the restaurant was empty there were like 2 people by the bar and we still had to wait 30 mins for the server to come and take our orders then another 40-60mins for them to bring our food.  The food was whatever.  At the end we ordered coffee and desserts so there goes another 20mins waiting for that.  I asked the waitress how much longer she said \"it's coming right up\" ok so we sit and wait.  After waiting for another 30 mins we asked for the check and still no dessert so we got up to leave and I told the waitress on the way out we never got our dessert she didn't even apologize or anything just smiled.  Will not be going back.  Was expecting more from this place."}
{"text":"We came for a late dinner, at around 9pm and were seated promptly. Our waiter was very polite and helpful in explaining the menu, wine options & prie fixe menu. We started with a glass of wine and a ginger & pineapple moscow mule.   We decided that we didn't need 2 desserts (regrets). So my husband got a meatball pizza and I ordered off the prie fixe menu. The meatball pizza was absolutely delicious, I would highly recommend it. The meatballs were very soft, and spiced well. The ricotta cheese was also a really nice touch. The crust was great too.   For the prie fixe dinner, I ordered the bruschetta, rigatoni & tiramisu. The bruschetta was really good, but kind of odd because it wasn't covered in tomatoes like I expected. But the little greens on the top was super good! The rigatoni was also super good, the sauce was a little watery but super tasty. The noodles were cooked well and there were tons of mushrooms. I added a healthy dose of fresh Parmesan too, so good! The tiramisu was good but more chocolatey than I expected too, but it was good. Our friend also did the prie fixe menu with a bruschetta, margherita pizza & Vanilla Zeppole.   The star of the meal for us was the vanilla zeppole! He didn't totally know what he was ordering, but we were so surprised when it came out. It was so fresh and warm, the Carmel sauce was super yummy too. Either way, everything we had was great, no complaints, but you have to order the vanilla zeppole!!!"}
{"text":"Omg, best dinner ever, try the meatballs for an appetizer !!!!! It's unassuming how good it was going to be but we will be BAck next time we are in Vegas. Good value as it was not I the casino. I enjoyed the sangria? Although don't sit overlooking the mall, it's very warm by there. Sit inside the resturaunt"}
{"text":"Service:  sucks. Waited 45  minutes for food. poor waiter they gave him the whole east dude of the restaurant to handle by himself.   Food: mediocre to bad. I had the Italian meat pizza. I think dominos pizza is a notch better.   Wolfgang... This restaurant is disappointing."}
{"text":"Happy Hour all day, everyday at the bar! This is the most important thing you need to know. Don't be fooled by the malicious tables calling your name. Plant your bootay at the bar and gobble up some deliciously priced pizzas, salads, appetizers and booze. ($5 Hoegaarden on tap!)  There is more than enough for a meal on the menu. We had two individual size pizzas, a salad, calamari and a glass of beer for around $30, and the only thing that slightly disappointed was the insalata mista. The dressing was pretty much oil without zing, but the greens were fresh and beautiful. The pizza dough was thin and soft. We had the veggie selection, and it did not have sauce, which my husband missed, but I didn't mind. I still thought the pizza was flavorful with Ricotta cheese. The calamari was tender and came with bonus fried shrimp and little veggies. The batter flavor was spiced nicely. An amazing value for on the Strip, especially at Crystals!  We came in about 30-minutes before closing, and we experienced no attitude. Arriving close to closing time is always a good test of service, as bad servers will glare at you or try to convince you the kitchen is closed. The bartender, who was our server, was friendly and not pushy even after the place had officially closed.  If you happen to have blown all your cash at Miu Miu or Fendi or Kiki or... wherever, sidle up to the bar and enjoy quality happy hour treats!"}
{"text":"Five star service from Tony!  Such a funny and crazy guy.    The bruschetta and the zeppoles are my favorite, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  I come to Vegas every couple of months and this is a Gem, amazing food, great service, and good prices.  I have had many different things on the menu and it is all excellent."}
{"text":"This place was great! Loved the location in the shoppes at aria and the menu. The pasta was delicious. We also had the meatball pizza which was perfect! The crust was amazing. The dessert donuts or zeppolis were delicious. The white chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce were great for dipping. Must try!"}
{"text":"Decided to try it for lunch and liked it! Decently priced and good food.  The boar ragu is great. The bruchetta is a little on  the sweeter side but still good."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Cucina tonight.  The food was excellent!! Since we did not have a reservation we were seated near the bar.  The waiter took our order, handed us the food, and almost didn't come back to see if we wanted to pay.  Someone was there to fill our water in his absence, so my complaints are soft complaints.  The pappardelle bolognese was excellent.  I have had a very similar dish in Italy and this meal was very authentic."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT a $$ restaurant. It's more between $$$ & $$$$ price wise. Went there for dinner. The food was good but for these prices you can get much better food other places! Worst than that are the staff who try really hard to force $8 bottle of water at you and immediately change attitude as soon as you don't order the most expensive food on the menu! Do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Everything here was a step above olive garden and just underwhelming.  We took our reps out for a quick dinner before the evening started to really roll.  The pastas were all a little overdone and not quite to our liking.  I mean it is really cheap and located in the shopping mall within citycenter.    Check out other places to really enjoy pucks culinary delights.  It just seems like they didn't get it right here.  The salads were actually pretty good though.  But they charge extra for anchovies.  Kinda shitty to charge extra for a salad that cost as much as a pizza.  Cheers and good luck!"}
{"text":"Me and the bf came here and sat at the bar, the bartender was great with switching the tv to a game we wanted to watch. We ordered drinks, apps and entrees, all of which we have zero complaints. The wings were CRISPY and delicious! We loved them! The Caesar salad came with anchovies, I'm sure you can request it without, but I don't mind them.  I got the raviolis, the large order, which in my opinion wasn't very large. They also were not filled enough and weren't pillow-like. They seemed to be off in the cheese to dough ratio. They were more flat and I believe it was simply because they were a) under filled and/or b) made with mozzarella cheese vs ricotta. Mozzarella melts differently than ricotta, which could have also contributed to the flatness of the ravioli. But otherwise they were delicious. But who couldn't use more cheese??! :-) Overall it was a great price for a nice relaxing dinner to break up the day.  $70 (before tip) for a pitcher of sangria, meat and cheese board, Caesar salad, wings, and raviolis. Not bad. We will be back to try new things."}
{"text":"Amazing service, good food and fine dining in upscale shopping. We were able to book a reservation same day for 8 ppl on a Saturday. No problem when we showed up with 9, they pulled over and extra table which gave some extra elbow room. They adjusted the place settings right away. Drinks were well made from iced tea to Sangria to martinis! I am big on glasses being refilled and our bus-person was on point! He was courteous but quiet and bothered no one. Our waiter was amazing, kind and very apologetic when they missed our order of ravioli. The manager and waiter did whatever they could to make it right. We shared pizza and salads, clams and linguini, pork chops and pesto, chicken and braised short ribs. Calamari was perfectly cooked. Whatever you order you will not be disappointed. Food was delicious....great job staff! We will be back to see you again.  Oh with meals & drinks but no appetizers or desserts price came to less than $40 per person before tips. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a couple of times and have had a great experience every times. They have the largest portion of clam linguine and it is always cooked to perfection. The pizza was also delicious and you cannot go wrong with any of them. They also have a happy hour menu if you sit at the bar. Service is attentive but a little slow. Overall, a nice casual lunch spot located in Crystals shopping center."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on this place as I've been here multiple times and received mixed service.  The first time I went was a few hours before my flight and ordered salad and pizza with a diet coke and everything seemed to be fine.  The second time I went was for lunch one day with two of mis amigos. We ordered a handful of items, and followed lunch with an expensive bottle of wine and a cheese plate.  The glasses were extremely dirty (all three, one had dried food pieces on it) and the server proceeded to pour what amounted to be $20 worth of wine into one of the glasses before we noticed the dried food piece mid-pour. We were in Vegas so we really didn't mind. The cheese-plate took about 30 minutes after they gave us the first bottle which was almost finished, and was more of an American-sized cheese-plate (huge pieces of cheese). I would still recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple during the beginning of March Madness. We thought the place would be packed but it wasn't, which surprised us. We got the meatballs as an appetizer and they were great! Every entree we ordered came out great and even better than we expected. I loved the setting of the restaurant also because we could watch people wander around the Crystals mall. If you come here make sure you go to the restroom to check it out, it's definitely different and a very cool design!"}
{"text":"Solid, solid Italian food in Vegas!  We made reservations for a Sunday night but we didn't need them as it was pretty empty at 8pm.  We ordered my favorite Roman pasta dish (cacio e pepe) as an app and loved it!  I have never seen this on a menu in the States so I was really impressed that they had it.  The cheese was fresh and the pepper gave it the perfect kick...I'd order this as my meal next time!  Then we got our dinners - my husband got some dddeeelicous meatballs and pasta I got pasta with meat sauce and it was GOOD.  Like, so good I wanted to go back for dinner the next day!  The pasta was al dente and the meat sauce was thick and flavorful and stuck right to the pasta.  Our server was quick and attentive.  We never had low waters and he was always around if we had a question or needed something.  The ONLY thing I didn't like about this place was that they didn't give bread unless you asked for it, and we actually had to ask twice before they brought it out to us.  Prices were pretty standard for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, and the quality of food was worth it!"}
{"text":"This Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina is located inside the Crystals shopping center on the 2nd floor. My husband and I came here for lunch before we headed to the airport and were seated right away; the hostess and server were very nice and friendly from arrival to departure.  We also liked the food here a lot, we had steamed mussels as appetizer, the sausages in the mussels were very tasty and mussels were perfectly cooked,  just the sizes were kind of small. I also had their special fish of the day, it was very tender and flavorful. Husband ordered their Beef Carpaccio and Steak Tartar and he liked it so much that he finished the everything in 5min.  We also ordered some of their red wine, I can't remember the name of it but it was recommended by the server; it was very smooth and flavorful, I wish we have more time to hang out there and try more food and wine.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wolfgang pucks is always a great choice for healthy delicious food.  No matter. Where I go from Orlando to Vegas or LA I can count on a great meal that is not cheap but won't use a whole paycheck either.  My Italian friends were impressed with the food, although Italians never have anything good to say about pasta unless they are in Italy"}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  The service is awesome.   Best salmon ive ever had.  They also have kid plates and the deserts are ridiculously scrumptious."}
{"text":"I had a Caesar salad with anchovies and ragu pasta. The food was delicious and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and excellent service! Tony, our waiter, was super friendly, attentive & entertaining! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Marinated olives and sopressata sandwich are great selections from the midday Tapas menu. The sangria by the pitcher will get you back on track if your suffering from a Las Vegas hangover."}
{"text":"Had the tomato bruschetta as an appetizer and the veal scallopini as an entree, both of which were delicious. If you're in Vegas, skip the buffets (which are usually disappointing) and head here instead."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual dinner on the first night of our staycation at Mandarin Oriental, so we chose this restaurant inside of Crystals. We were impressed by the modern dining room and, although casual, there was a taste of elegance in the warm, inviting decor. And since it's pretty open on the second floor of Crystals, you can do some good people-watching while you dine.   My husband called ahead and told them we were celebrating my birthday (which was the next day). The hostess greeted me by name and wished me a happy birthday, which I thought was nice. Everyone was extremely attentive throughout the entire meal. Waters never went empty, we were never left alone for long, and they checked on us frequently without being overbearing.   We tried the Caesar salad, chicken piccata, and margherita pizza. All were delicious. I don't like capers, but I pushed them to the side of the chicken and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The pizza was very good - fresh tasting sauce and cheese on a softer crust and, although I've never been, it's what I imagine a fresh pizza would taste like in Italy. For dessert we tried the zeppoles. What an interesting take on a simple Italian dessert. They were filled with a creamy orange custard and served with caramel dipping sauce. Delightful! They had a very nice wine list and a full bar (happy hour at the bar all day, every day. If I'm in the area I'll definitely stop in for a drink and a nosh!).   Also, this restaurant has a \"Compliments of the Chef\" locals program in place that entitles locals to preferred seating, priority reservations, and a free dessert per couple. Just tell them you're local!"}
{"text":"Our experience at Cucina was outstanding. The service, right off the bat, was terrific. Our server, Quetzi, was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. My girlfriend has a severe gluten allergy, and Quetzi walked us through everything on the menu and checked on the specials to be sure that they could be prepared gluten-free.  I do not eat GF, but we ordered everything GF that night, and I can confidently say that gluten-free diners will love Cucina.  We started with the Piccollo antipasti plate, and it was a pretty sizable portion that makes a great appetizer for two (but could probably accommodate three as well). The bread, which is about the only thing Cucina did not have a GF option for, is outstanding. The meats, cheeses and olive tapenade were all great.  The Ensalata pizza on a GF crust was great. Crispy but not dry, it had a great basil pesto sauce with some acid added from a little red wine vinegar. The greens on top were fresh and delicious.  Cucina only had gluten-free rigatoni as a pasta option that night, but it was scratch-made in house. It was incredible. My girlfriend said it was the best pasta she's ever had since being forced to alter her diet more than seven years ago. I would never have known it was GF pasta. It was cooked to perfection, and the Manila clams, shrimp and calamari that accompanied it were delicious and perfectly cooked.  We also had Cucina's house Pinot Noir (from Wolfgang's own label), which we got free with a MyVegas voucher. It was delicious, with hints of cherry and cocoa.  I cannot recommend Cucina enough. Everything about our experience was worthy of five stars."}
{"text":"I had Mahi tacos. The fish was just at tad rare, crispy cabbage, and surprisingly good corn tortillas. You could taste the fresh fish. You get some lime to add however much lemon you like with your fish. I like the taste of lime and salt. Though not offered, a hot sauce would go great with this dish."}
{"text":"Cousins came to visit and we did a bit of walking and shopping. Come time for lunch,  we could not decide. Finally, I was asked Carnegie Deli or Wolfgang Puck. I looked, deadpaned and just said \"DUH! Wolfgang Puck\". Service was great, our server giving us suggestions on not just the food, but specialty drinks as well. I didn't do much talking,  i was just enjoying my food. The BEST butternut squash soup EVER!"}
{"text":"Tony took great care of us! At first we were apprehensive to eat at a 'mall restaurant' but we're greatly pleased with the service and the delicious, incredible meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always great food and great service. It's never overwhelmingly busy and has a great comfortable vibe. Order anything and you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This is a place you walk by and just think, oh wow it looks nice and fancy but it doesn't seem like the food will be great here.    It's never crowded and the menu doesn't seem extravagant.  But let me tell you, don't be deceived... the food is delicious here.  We started out with a calamari; it was cooked to perfection.  The calamari was tender and crispy with a light breading.  The sauces that came with it was a lemon-pesto and a cocktail sauce.  Both were amazing and kept it fresh.  I had the margherita pizza which seems fairly plain but was the best margherita pizza i've had.  The salty cheese and crispy soft bread and the savory tomato sauce all complimented each other.    My SO had the cheese panini with tomato soup; the best that she's ever had and she's a grilled cheese and tomato soup fanatic.  We were so full we couldn't order dessert.  I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I give it five stars for location/service. Server was great, nice ambience, the food was weak....shrimp scampi, WEAK, Margherita pizza, WEAKraviolis was empty ... Lol don't make me laugh. I've  had ketchup that was better then their sauce. Come on Wolfgang, what the PUCK, I was really disappointed what an $85 waste, it would have been better spent in A slot machine..LOL.  If you want some real Italian food go to Batista's hole in the wall....I can't believe this is an Italian eatery I would never go back. This review is just my personal opinion of this establishment. Opinions may very."}
{"text":"So obsessed with this place, I want to go back to Vegas just to have the pasta. We went for a casual dinner & were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was! The pasta was cooked perfectly & the sauce was to die for, don't get me started about how good the meatballs were! Definitely will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We had another amazing dining experience at Cucina by Wolfgang Puck.    They just happened to have gluten-free ravioli available the night we dined.  They were light and delicious with cheese filing and a marvelous tomato sauce on top.  This time we also tried the gluten-free mushroom pizza with fontina, braised leeks, taleggio and a fried egg on top!  OMG, I have a new favorite - the flavors together on this pizza were unique and magical!  Wow, Wolfgang Puck... you really knocked it out of the park with this home run!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the wife! We had the bruschetta, garlic bread, and rigatoni. Everything was great. Service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars! Pork belly with balsamic yummy:-) Crispy arancini great... Roasted pepper aioli the bomb!!! Great deal on Kids meal! I apologize for late review came here several months ago."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here early one night before a show. Seating was quick, and we even noted the unique water glasses (wine bottle bottoms). Took a while for our food to come but once it did we thoroughly enjoyed the thin crust pizza and eggplant Parmesan. Yum! I'd definitely return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Vegas - our server DJ was a delight as well. Very family friendly - great menu with a variety if you need to cater to different tastes.   My family and I chose to eat here while we were shopping at mall where the restaurant is located because of the name - Wolfgang Puck!  My wife had a steak that was perfect - son had the best spaghetti we have ever tasted, my daughter had a burger which was fantastic and I had the salmon which was remarkable - I ordered asparagus which was the best I have ever had.    Management of the restaurant was very attentive and even went out of the way to make our visit special by granting us a small favor which my kids will remember.   If you have a chance the visit here is worth it - great value for a meal on the strip. We went back a couple more times during our stay and had incredible meals and great service each time."}
{"text":"Well, everything in Vegas seems to \"stand out\" and this place's design is no exception.   We had 7 people in our group and apparently there were only a few tables that could fit all of us...one of which was located in an unusual spot. Our table was behind the big sign at the entrance and also behind one of the big support pillars. You can barely see us from inside the restaurant but from the outside, we're in plain view. It felt weird because we were literally right next to the escalator and the entrance so people were walking right by us and staring...kind of like when people look at the primate enclosures at the zoo. One side of the table had chairs and the other side had a really low couch; when I sat down the table level was at my chest.  I had the chicken panini with a side of potato chips. Both were excellent. Arguably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The rosemary fries were amazing as well.  Most of the group had the same linguini and clams dish but most of the clams were either empty or had tiny bits of clam.  5 stars for food but 4 stars for the weird table layout."}
{"text":"To add up  unfortunately your restrooms are so dirty  bad ugly  again dirty dirty dirty."}
{"text":"Just got done with shopping and walked over to eat. Asked for a table and the hostess rudely informed me that they are closed. Now I frequent the place as I live next door. I asked her to confirm that they closed two minutes ago. She proceeded to laugh in my face and say yes then turned around. They just lost a loyal costumer which is rare for Vegas. I overlooked the fruit flies in the past but this level of rude and disrespect is beyond me!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night with a reservation and had no wait time. The space is really nice and the tables are well spaced out. The service was great, friendly, funny waiter who was attentive and polite in spite of the fact that we weren't ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. We got the Chicken Piccata and the Pork Milanese, both were phenomenal: great portion sizes, yummy sauces, nice presentation, and both around $25. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Have been here every time we visit Vegas.  Pizza is delish, sangria is spectacular, their salads, rib eye, pasta is tastey!  What's no to love!  Eat here and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We did the Sunday family style dinner as part of my bachelorette party and honestly best meal we had in Vegas all weekend! A ton of food for 20 dollars a person and it was soo flavorful! (salad, pizza, meatballs, chicken parm and 2 desserts). And all the entrees were delicious, every part was exceptional.  Shout out to our server Vance!"}
{"text":"Very good food for a pleasantly not absurd price.  The setting was surprisingly pleasant for a mall."}
{"text":"I was on a work trip and staying at the Mandarin Oriental. It was during lunch and most places around were busy. I happen to walk by Cucina and noticed some seats available at the bar. I've been to other Wolfgang places and have always been impressed with the food.  This was no different. I ordered their salad and added grilled salmon that was perfectly cooked. The salad was well balanced and not over dressed.  Being an Italian themed restaurant I had to add a side of meatballs. They came out scorching hot and delicious - yum!  A reason why I didn't give it a 5 star although the food was great and the bartender was super nice, they were a bit slow in taking my order as well as bringing the food out.  The gentleman next to me had a harder time as he was obnoxiously complaining. Nonetheless it was entertaining for me.  I'd definitely recommend if you are looking for a bite that is not too pricey and packed due to the casino or hotel crowd as this location is in a high end mall attached to Aria."}
{"text":"Very good. I've never had a bad meal at any of Puck's restaurants and this one is no exception.  Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza was good, but one of the few vegetarian options available. I'm not so sure the sunny-side-up egg worked on top, however."}
{"text":"Last lunch before leaving Vegas, and did not disappoint! I made lunch reservations not knowing if they were going to be busy. They weren't on a weekday and we were led to a nice table overlooking the mall. Cucina is located inside Crystals and a very short walk from Aria's entrance which made the trip even more convenient.  They have a great 3-course lunch special for $25 to include an appy, entree, and a small dessert. Great price esp for it being in the strip and inside Crystals.  We were given bread and olive oil/ vinegar to munch on, and I ordered the following: -Shrimp scampi ($5 extra): The 3 shrimp were large and the flavors of the garlic and lemon were on par. I loved how they included bread so you can use it to dip into the sauce! YUM!!! -Ravioli (no peas): I enjoyed my entree. It was a white light sauce used and it was the perfect kind. Not too heavy and not too creamy. I didn't care for the white asparagus but the mushrooms were good. -Tiramisu: Small dessert and not overbearing. It was the perfect amount to finish off a lunch. I also tried my friends Vanilla Zeppole (donut holes) and they were good - sugar coated donuts.  Our service was great and we were checked on frequently. Waters were filled and the ambiance was cool. Loved how there is a strip restaurant that is reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Very Very good pizza.  Enjoyed ourselves very much.  Had Sangria which was delicious.  Loved the circular appearance of the restaurant allowed you to see what was going on without being completely in the mix of all the chaos.  Located in one of the chic new hotels this last few years.  First time in the crystal shops.  Used open table to book a reservation and worked great!"}
{"text":"Wolfgang did not live up to my expectations. I was torn between the ravioli and the lasagna, and the waiter talked me into the lasagna. When I got it, it was the first time I've ever received lasagna by itself (without any bread or sides). I tasted it, bland. It just wasn't amazing at all. My friend got the $27 salmon which came with mashed potatoes, and I guess it was good, but $27 worth? Not by my standards. The $19 lasagna was probably worth $4 to me. First and last visit to Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria."}
{"text":"I must come here every time I visit vegas!! I have tried the pizzas and some pastas but I must say the clam linguini and wild boar are my most favorite. Too bad last time I went they did not have the wild boar pasta for some reason so I got the veal ravioli instead and that was really good as well! This is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip!"}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas with my husband and three kids. Being in Vegas as a family of five can be very pricey. However if the quality and service is great than cost is all worth it. That is exactly what you find here at Cucina! The food was so amazingly delicious! The ministrone soup was superb! My son orderd ravioli and it tasted like was just freshly made. My hubby ordered seabass and it was cooked to perfection. My daughters ordred margarita pizza, they loved it! The service was amazing as well. Our server was really sweet and funny!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza place.  I had the Italian meat pizza and it was great.  Service was good too. Caesar salad was good but not great."}
{"text":"Great vibes!! The service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The food was great too. We got the mushroom pizza and pasta. Both were very tasty. Only issue was that both dishes were very oily. But still good. The dessert was great too. The doughnuts were amazinggg!"}
{"text":"came to Vegas for the first time over memorial day weekend. came from Oakland CA. really wanted to experience some great food. the guys I came with didn't want to eat here after seeing the menu (went to shake shack instead. what a waste) but that didn't deter me. this food was mindblowing. had the Brick Chicken and Caesar salad. chicken had a kick to it, a little spicy, but man was it good. the food was great but Apollo, my server, was the highlight. this guy was amazing. we had good talks about life and not getting overwhelmed  by it. he knew his food. knew the drinks. but really just a pleasant guy. Apollo if you're reading this, you the man."}
{"text":"Majorly disappointed that they ran out of ingredients for both white and red sangria but then it was almost 8pm.  Loved that the waiter sensed our disappointment and instead gave us some free shots.  Now if that isn't customer service, I don't know what is!  The food and service is excellent.  Very efficient on water refills.  I was excited to try a Wolfgang Puck joint and was definitely not disappointed (aside from the sangria).  I opted for a pizza, my sister had the lasagna.  Both were the best of the best that we have had.  I enjoyed the casual yet \"fancy\" feel of the restaurant.  Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely stop in for the happy hour specials, which I hear are awesome."}
{"text":"My friend and I needed a quick place for lunch before we flew off, back home to Cali. Thank goodness we saw the pre-fixe options here when we walked through the mail earlier in our trip.  There was a great variety to choose from in the pre-fixe menu. I went with the minestrone soup, chicken, and dessert. The soup was very mild and could have used a little more flavor. My main entree was very yummy! Cooked and paired well with the pasta. As for dessert, donut holes with dipping sauce.  All not bad for the price. Overall great experience. Service was good. Nice location in the mall."}
{"text":"The linguine side for $7 blew me out of the water.  The simplicity and excellent taste were beyond any other food we had in vegas.  This place redefines fresh pizzas.  We had a spectacular lamb chorizo pizza"}
{"text":"The service and the ambiance was nice. I ordered the spaghetti and a side of meatballs. The food was tasty, although the meatballs were a tad bit salty."}
{"text":"Located inside Crystals Mall, Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria & Cucina offers a gorgeous yet inviting dining room, as well as a modern and chic bar and lounge scene. The restaurant's orientation offer's a bird's eye view of the Crystals Mall, but if you want something more intimate, opt for the interior dining.   The menu is clearly Italian-influenced, with choices like Italian pizzas, salads, pastas & paninis. They also have authentic appetizers such as Italian salumi (San Daniele Prosciutto, my ultimate fav...not easy to find in the U.S) , Grilled Octopus, and Prime Beef Carpaccio. The fine selection they have really demonstrated the authenticity the restaurant brings forth.   Prices are reasonable, so this is a great option if you aren't looking to drop money as if you were dining at Joel Robuchon. The food is definitely well-prepared and nicely presented. The wine list is also solid, with options from both the US and Italy. Glasses are reasonably priced at $8-$12 range.   My most memorable thing here was the dessert- Italian Doughnuts - the Zeppole. I haven't had Zeppole in the states in ages..so this was a delectable and pleasant surprise! Paired with caramel dipping sauce and vanilla gelato - this makes for an outstanding dessert to share! They're fluffy and light, and not overly sweet (comparable to French Beignets).   There a number of reputable Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. Many renowned chefs have opened restaurants on the strip -Mario Batali, most notably for Carnevino in the Palazzo and B&B in the Venetian, Valentino's in the Venetian, Bartolotta in the Wynn - the list is really very extensive. But, if you want to eat somewhere that is appropriate for a casual lunch, a glass of wine in the afternoon, or a solid dinner meal -this is your go-to place for any occasion. The hospitality and service will also impress you."}
{"text":"Was formerly Brasserie PUCK. LOVE the new concept and menu. The pizzas are traditional great Wolfgang fare...try the mussels...to die for!"}
{"text":"Imaginense lo emocionada que fui a un restaurant con el nombre de Wolfgang Puck en la marquesina .... como decepciono! Se merece dos estrellas y media, porque a 3 no llega, especialmente para la expectativa que genera El lugar esta dentro de un shopping, como muchos de los lugares de Las Vegas, pero este de alguna forma decepcionaba mas, el lugar era realmente shopping y el restaurant como uno de esos locales en uno de los pasillos, abierto de todos lados y con mucha luz artificial. Me sente en la barra, y a pesar de que eramos pocas personas en el local, llamar la atencion de un mozo parecia tarea imposible. Finalmente logre que me dieran bola, para traerme unos ravioles sin mucho gusto a nada que estaban medio frios, ni les cuento para cuando me trajeron el queso parmesano. Me cobraran por ellos un precio bastante alto.  No creo que vuelva"}
{"text":"Wow, this place serves the SALTIEST clam linguini I have ever tasted!  No exaggeration - it may well have been the saltiest dish I have ever been served.  Ever.  I ate here with two friends, and two of us ordered the linguini and our other friend had the bolognese.  Not one of us could even eat the food without first putting lemon juice on it to neutralize the saltiness.  Not to mention that my friend's linguini had most of the creamy sauce in it while mine was mostly butter and herbs (they were made in the same pan, so wtf?!) I've always known Wolfgang Puck's restaurant was nothing to write home about, but this experience was extremely disappointing.  It wasn't cheap, either.  And no soda refills were offered, just weird tasting tap water.  Which also needed lemon just to make it tolerable.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This happy hour is so worth it.  I had the chunky tomato soup (not on the happy hour menu) for my starter and it was Delish.  If you like a good chunky soup.  Then I had the mushroom pizza with a white sauce. It had a interesting flavor but I liked it.  Then, I had the calamari and it was ok but the price was good and the presentation was ok.  The service was so so at the bar. Plus, you get a 20 percent off for YELP."}
{"text":"I wish I can give no star at all.  My wife and I had a long day and couldnt wait to come back to hotel. we ordered food togo but the server is very unhelpful and they got our order wrong. We ordered pasta and salad and they forgot to include the forks.  When we call and complain to manager, he claims that they do not provide it unless we have to ask for it. Doe this make sense to you?? We have to ask for forks when we ordered pasta and salad?? What kind of service is that?  manager is the biggest joke of all. Doesn't even understand english. All he said was \"comeback and pick it up or ask for forks at your hotel\". what a jerk!!!   I will never ever go back to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Tony was a great server, very attentive and enthusiastic. Steak was great along with pizza and bruschetta. Low key for the strip."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and their 3 course offer is both reasonable and tasty.   Sizing is great and the food was well prepared.   Service is quick and is very attentive. Be aware that coffee refills will cost you !   Salad was amazing . The Salmon was well cooked and crispy and the tiramisu was very tasty and the side of roasted cauliflower was beautiful and tasted great."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced for Vegas, but I would skip it and go to somewhere a little more expensive but not order as much.  We had lunch here and ordered a salad, pizza, and a panini. All lacked in flavor. The pizza was thin and I could hardly taste the sauce, and the prosciutto tasted low quality. The panini was basically a piece of bread with bits and bobs of cheese and pork. The bread was okay, and it wasn't toasted/pressed properly.   Was completely disappointed in every facet of my experience here, service, the booths have weird cushions that sink when you sit down, and we ordered a drink and it turned out to be \"mini\" size, was expecting regular size.    Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Got seated right in. The menu was simple. We ordered the caprese salad and italian sausage pizza.   The waiter took a long time to get our orders and the food took somewhat a long time.  Got the caprese salad - it had tomatoes, mozzarella, pesto and balsamic vinegarette. Expensive for a salad, it was good not great... I wish I had a bit more acid with the salad. Never getting a salad that pricey.  Got italian sausage pizza and it was good. The crust was thin and it was hot. The cheese however, fell off the pizza at times. There was little sausage and it had garlic pieces on top. I don't know what the greens were on the pizza, I think it was broccoli or something along the lines of that, but it gave a bit bitter taste because of the greens.  Overall, the place and location is in the Crystals. The place is modern and its kinda small. The service is a bit mediocre. The price is a little on the pricey side. Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in the MGM Grand is better because there are more choices to choose from and its good... better than this place."}
{"text":"Bland tasteless food, mediocre service, and boring atmosphere. Not worthy of being in one of the nicest shopping centers in the world."}
{"text":"Being a couple steps away from the Aria this Pizzeria and Cucina was perfect for a nice lunch. It is located inside the Crystals complex which exudes class and high life. This Pizzeria is actually pretty WELL PRICED in my opinion for the quality of the food that you get and the service. Wolfgang Puck is everywhere in Vegas so it is almost expected that you will eventually try is fare.  We ordered a classic Margherita Pizza and kicked it up a notch with the Duck Confit Pizza. Both were absolutely delicious and well made. Not too mention, surprisingly filling. Other than their pizza they did have an assortment of paninis and pasta to choose from. My fellow guest chose a nicely crafted beer to go along with his pizza and I chose their Puccini (which made for midafternoon fabulousness!)  The Margherita Pizza was well made and definitely some of the better pizza I have tried. Duck Confit pizza was very different and an interesting experience for my palate. The base for the pizza is a squash base which makes it more heavy while complementing the sprinkled Duck Confit. There are great choices for herbs placed on their pizzas as well.  I was happy with the service, though would have liked it if the waiter stopped by to refill our water more.   Overall, great deal for some great cuisine! Try it!"}
{"text":"It's that hole in the wall in the middle of an upscale mall, The Shops at Crystal. Another one of Wolfgang Puck's establishments, Cucina is a small upscale restaurant right next to Starbucks. By the way, that Starbucks is not owned by corporate so your Starbucks promo cards might not work if you go there. I made a reservation through Open Table which they happily accommodated.  -As a shareable starter, we ordered the Bruschetta (tomato, pesto, aged balsamic, parmesan) $11.  -I ordered the Rigatoni (bolognaise, ricotta salata) $23. I was more of craving for a specific bolognaise (veal-pork) which I did not find in this restaurant. The rigatoni was okay, nothing special.  -My significant other ordered the Eggplant Parmesan (spaghetti \"cacio e pepe\") $25. It was served in separate plates and there was plenty of pasta to share. -We didn't order any alcohol since our hotel was quite far from this area but there was a bar in the middle of the restaurant. They offer a good variety of bubbles, white, red, and dessert wines to choose from."}
{"text":"I came here this past weekend while we were in Vegas celebrating my birthday. We had a dinner reservation for a party of 10 and after a long day at the pool and drinking everyone was running late. They were very accomodating and held our table while our party trickled in. The service was great and the food was fabulous! Absolutely loved everything we ordered. The veggie pizza with truffle oil was great, I've been craving it since I had it and the caesar salad was superb! I will definitely be visiting this place everytime I'm back in LV."}
{"text":"Quetzi was our server. She is sweet, attentive, and full of energy. The food is delicious and exactly what I was craving. I ordered the Caesar salad and the Bolognese pasta."}
{"text":"Came here at Wolfgang Puck Pizzeria and Cucina with my girlfriend around 4. We both got a cocktails. The server Kristine reccomend white sangria and we got aMoscow mule and a white sangria. Had the prosciutto pizza and the best service of our  life!   Cannot wait to go back.  Kristine was the best!"}
{"text":"Good food and portions. Service and staff were great! I had a pretty satisfying experience (:"}
{"text":"We came from Az to Las Vegas to celebrate my son-in-laws birthday & the meal was fantastic from beginning to end.  The sea bass, seafood pasta & sirloin were cooked to perfection.  They presented our birthday boy with a delicious zeppole dessert.  We cannot wait to go back to Cucino."}
{"text":"Very slow service but Tony compensated with free tea and bruschetta, he was very helpfull"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Wolfgang Puck restaurants. There are so many here in Vegas, but this is one of the few I haven't been to. It's located in the The Shops at Crystal. I picked Cucina because it's so close to the Bellagio and I'm bringing kids, so I can't travel too far.     We were seated immediately at a table by a window. It's a perfect place for people watching because everyone takes a detour through here to avoid the sun and catch some A.C. Plus I find the atmosphere and decor to be modern and clean but still warm. It's also a very open space, so I don't feel crowded or rushed. I ordered a fixed price meal for myself and a kids pizza for my daughter. Yes, they have a kids menu. That's like an automatic bonus point for me. Included in my meal was a starter, a main course and a desert. I opted for an eggplant bruschetta as my starter and added a pepperoni pie for the main dish. My wife ordered the shrimp scampi appetizer and the ravioli with white asparagus, mushrooms and peas.     \"Well how did it taste?\" You ask. I though the food was delicious across the board! Both appetizers were tasty but my bruschetta was tiny and left me hungry. The scampi on the other hand was a big portion and tasted \"lick your fingers\" good! My pizza was rustic or simple. It had a thin crust cooked crispy with a basic tomato sauce and a good amount of kick thanks to the pepperoni. Even better than my pie was the ravioli. The sauce and filling were creamy and buttery, but surprisingly not heavy. The mushrooms do a solid job filling in for a protein, so you're not left feeling hungry. I thought it was the best thing on the menu and worth coming back for.     For desert we split the tiramisu and zeppoles. A zeppole is basically fried dough with a creamy filling. This version was absolutely amazing and came with a side of warm strawberry preserves that could have been served on its own. The tiramisu was very good as well. It was light and had a cinnamon and rum kick to balance the drizzled chocolate on the plate. I enjoyed every course and thought the value was worth $35 a person.    Without a doubt, my food was great. My only complaint was how much time I spent here. It took WAY TOO LONG! I was here for over 90 minutes and I didn't order drinks or anything out of the ordinary. It took our server 20 minutes to take our payment and process our check. She literally dissspeared with my credit card for 20 minutes and didn't come back to give us an update. That kinda behavior makes me nervous as a customer. And I know that nothing funny was happening with my stuff. I know the only reason I had to wait was because next to us was a large party and all 13 of them were paying with a split checks or doing something super complicated. But that's not a ME problem, that's a YOU problem. And when I'm at a nice restaurant, I'm paying extra so that ME is treated well. I'm still going to recommend you grab a meal at Cucina, but don't be surprised if getting out takes a little while."}
{"text":"Top notch service!! Service is very attentive and impeccable.  The food was great.  The pizza prices are very affordable and the pizzas were a good size.  The caesar salad was very good and they were nice enough to split it up on two plates for us.  The calamari was very tasty.  I recommend this place and would come back.  I love when places refill your drinks promptly, take our money promptly, and get us on our way.  It's a nice date ambiance so dressing up for this place would be nice, but I went casual because I was there for the Las Vegas Marathon to load up on carbs.  We made a reservation for 6 and were seated promptly."}
{"text":"Weak. Totally overpriced and lame.   We ended up with a $100 giftcard to the whole CRYSTALS shopping center, which was pretty much dead when we came to the Vdara hotel for a couple of weekdays. Maybe they thought I'd buy a $3000 watch if they gave me $100, but of course that's a bunch of bullcrap so I was going to get a meal or two out of that $100. This is one of the only places in the complex for a regular lunch, so there we went.   I had high hopes since we went to Spago (didn't mean to go to multiple Wolfgang Puck restaurants) the previous night and loved it. However, for the price the food here was weak and forgettable.   I got veal ravioli with mushrooms. Lots of mushrooms. The weird fungi looking kind that don't really taste like anything. This was pretty much the focal point of the dish, because nothing else really stood out. The sauce was pretty bland and the veal didn't taste like much of anything. The portion was good but for $20+ I was really glad I had a gift card. Don't get me wrong, for $10 per plate I still would have thought it was weak, but for about $70 total after tip I was just mad out of principle.   Scampi appetizer was also kind of weak. Just lots of butter.   Just kind of a weird experience. Supposedly in this really upscale complex being served expensive food but it tasted more like something from a chain.  Lots of tourists at the other tables (sometimes not knowing what or how to order, being foreign tourists..) because there's just nowhere else to eat. What a weird scene!   Also service was slow. We got there right when it was opening at 11, so we could use up our giftcard before driving back to Fresno. And this would hold us over til we got home too. But the slow service was whack. We were one of the first people in and people who showed up much later than us were eating before we got our dishes. Lame!"}
{"text":"service: The waiters were all very friendly and kind.   food: the size was really big for me. but the taste was good. Especially the Bolognese rigatoni  environment: It's located inside a high fashion mall and surrounded by shops. Very quite unlike on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Currently one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.   Be it the flavoury chicken piccata, thin crust mushroom pizza or eggplant, this place knows how to cook a good meal!  My chicken was perfectly cooked, no too dry and I felt satisfied after the meal without the usually yucky bloated feeling I usually get after a big meal.   The prices are reasonable and I love a bargain. I really dig the setting (Aria balcony), we had an attentive and respectful waiter.  Overall, this place is great, hope it stays this way"}
{"text":"*Thumbs up* The grilled octopus salad had a tangy, citrus vinaigrette that complimented the pieces of tender octopus. The manila clams in the linguine main entree were fresh, and the freshly grated parmesan cheese on top was a nice touch.  *Thumbs down* The margherita pizza came free courtesy of MyVegas loyalty points, but that doesn't excuse the soggy and flavorless crust. The pizza could've used more fresh pieces of basil, instead of just one measly herb per slice."}
{"text":"Hey LV yelpers! I had dinner here last night with my gf who lives next door in the Veer towers. I was really excited to try a new restaurant and I have never been to a Wolfgang puck's before... I wasn't really impressed with the food. We ordered the cheese ravioli, Margarita pizza and lemon cheesecake with blueberries. It was OKAY, would I go back? Probably not unless we are lazy to drive off the strip since it's walking distance from her place.  In my yelp opinion I rather drive off strip and get the same or better quality food for a better price tag $ My gf's friend was our waitress so we had good customer service.  I probably won't be back especially since I don't drink so even happy hour won't bring me back. Next."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey especially with the Canadian dollar so weak.... But, it was worth it.... my Fritto Misto was not only easy on the eye, but delectable!! Simply fried to perfection! I especially enjoyed the fried lemon slices!  Paired w/ their Sauvignon Blanc (Wolfgang Puck) .... In my humble opinion....A perfect way to start the night in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I went back here based on my great previous experience. Ordered the veal meatballs from the bar and a margarita pizza. Meatballs were kind of gross (not what I was expecting, they had like a fried crust and no sauce) and pizza tasted exactly like the kind of plain pizza you order from a regular pizza place (but good still). Place was fine but it was not worth coming twice."}
{"text":"It's one of the best Italian place. Thumbs up for the food and the design of dinnerware."}
{"text":"Server and food was very great. Everything was nice except the hostess was not very friendly. Made me not want to eat there at all (at least in my opinion)."}
{"text":"I looked up Wolfgang Puck's different restaurants and decided on the Pizzeria & Cucina. It is located inside the Aria above Starbucks. I came here between lunch and dinner, and not surprisingly, it wasn't busy, so I sat at the bar. They have a happy hour menu, but despite the name, it's actually available all day, seven days a week.  To start, I had a glass of the red wine sangria, which was wonderfully sweet. It ended up being one of the best-tasting sangrias I've ever had. For an appetizer, I tried the grilled pork belly with balsamic glaze. Quite small, but I loved how it was so tender on the inside with a crunchy exterior. For my main entree, I had a half order of spaghetti and meatballs. Some of the pasta dishes are available in a half size, so just ask. Spaghetti and meatballs seem so simple, but they did it perfectly! They also gave me complimentary bread with butter and red pepper flakes when asked.   The bartender was attentive, and service was excellent overall. Really enjoyed my experience here!"}
{"text":"Very cool and casual place for great Italian food..I loved the ravioli with wild mushrooms and margherita pizza was awesome. .great value"}
{"text":"Wow, I was not expecting such a tasty meal from (what appeared to be) a mall food court style spot.  The bar and dining area were all open to the mall 'elements' and simply decorated with no linens on the tables and basic glass/flatware.   However...the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in making suggestions from the menu. EVERYTHING was delicious! We started with the Tomato Bruschetta, Grilled Ciabatta, Basil Pesto, Parmesan Reggiano as an appetizer, it was unique and perfectly balanced in flavor. We also ordered the Margherita pizza, Italian Sausage pizza, Baby Kale salad, and Garganelli Carbonara. Everyone in our party was satisfied and raved about the great flavors.  I was thoroughly impressed, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"We were invited back to try Cucina again and this is an update on my past review. First off,  the service was top notch and of course the food was awesome. Dave, who waited on us, was attentive and made our dining experience awesome.. We ordered the pork steak, linguine w clams, chicken, sausage pizza, and cured beef with cheese. We cleaned up the plates and did not leave any food left on the plates..The food was good the first time and even better the second time. But more importantly we were treated like VIPS and i just want to thank Evan and his staff for making that happen..thks Evan. We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but nothing to write home about, except the garlic bread.  I had the veal marsala and my friend had the eggplant parmesan.  I ate at Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill and it was way better and also cheaper.  Staff here was nice, but server was way too chatty.  Had a nice view of the mall to people watch though."}
{"text":"Highlights from the menu (as of 11/19/2016):  - bruschetta (antipasti): $8, one of the best I've tried! The tomatoes tasted so fresh and the ingredients blended so well together. definitely recommend!  - soppressata (pizza): $17, soooo good! I'm not a huge fan of salami but the pizza was so delicious I didn't mind at all.  - rigatoni (pasta): $20, definitely good for sharing. My group also got the pappardelle which was also good, but if you are looking for something for tomato sauce based, I would go for the ravioli.   - bistecca for 2 (daily specials): $79, also highly recommend!! The order came out a little more rare than expected (we asked for medium rare), so keep that in mind if you're ordering this. The meat is so soft and rich, I was sold after one bite! Comes with potatoes and broccolini, from what I remember.   Overall this place has GREAT ambiance, GREAT service, and GREAT food. Good for groups or with another person- if you're coming with one other person, I'd recommend a pizza and pasta to share. Thanks for a great experience! I will definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only the food but the service is top notch. I spoke to the manager and chef to do something special for my girlfriend's birthday. They went above and beyond. The Chef made a dish for her that was her favorite in the past and had been off the menu. Truly went out of their way to make the day special for her. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Came here to cucina today for lunch.our waiter Tony was fantastic. A+ service. I ordered the sea bass and it was prepared perfectly. Picatta, with lemon butter sauce and broccolini. I will definatly be back and order this again. My companion had the veal scaloppini and was very happy with his meal. The environment is lovely, modern and relaxed. A very nice retreat from the noisy casinos. Will be back"}
{"text":"First time trying this place for my cousins bday and was not impressed.  Wasn't horrible but don't think I'd come back for a few reasons.    Location is inside the crystal shops adjacent to the aria hotel.  Kind of an interesting location being in a shopping mall with a wide open concept.  A few reasons why I didn't like this place.  1. Waiter was VERY nice (his name was Tony).  But not sure if it's because it wasn't packed or possibly felt like he was the only waiter working for Saturday night dinner, but service was really slow.  Long wait for food and check.    2. Food wasn't amazing.  Saw a bunch of pics on Yelp that may have been outdated but a lot of those foods were not on the menu anymore.  We have the spaghetti (decent), pepperoni pizza (decent), margherita pizza (not good), prosciutto pizza (VERY good), and ravioli (plain).    Glad I got to try the place, but most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the best surprise of our recent trip to Vegas. We generally avoid the big name chef spots, but gave this a try for lunch. Full menu at the bar (excellent start). The bartender (who reminded me for all the world of Jim from \"The Office\") topped up my prosecco (moving along nicely). The kitchen initially advised that I couldn't have my chosen appetizer, then sent out a modified version made especially for me (Brownie points accumulating rapidly). Both of us had pizza which was really, really good. I asked the very personable bartender for a drink fit for a winner and he whipped one up. When the bill came, they were experiencing issues with the credit card system, so they knocked off one beer for the trouble (fantastic finish, boys). Check out the Chihuly's (good) on the way to the offputting semi-unisex bathroom (bad)."}
{"text":"Best four-course meal I've had for the value! $55 bucks for the chef's tasting menu - includes salad, shrimp scampi, pasta dish, seabass and steak, and three different dessert samplers...all per person! Will definitely be back again to do it!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim since we had a gift certificate for the Crystals and saw that the prices here were surprisingly more reasonable than the pub nearby.  We had great service starting with their consideration of one of our guest's allergies and their helpful service when the food took a little bit longer to prepare.  The food itself was great, we started with the shrimp scampi which was a good sized appetizer for two people consisting of the bread, toppings and a good amount of shrimp.  We each ordered the prosciutto pizza, hers without cheese and mine with cheese, both variants were very good and were sizable enough for one person each to have and still have some leftovers.  Overall, I would recommend dining here to anyone who is looking for a more upscale dining experience that still feels comfortably casual."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely phenomenal! We've eaten here so many time this review is long overdue. Just brought my friend here for the first time the other day and she too fell in love. The calamari and shrimp are my two favorite appetizers. For entree, I am obsessed with the spaghetti and meatballs (truly the best here) and carbonara. Their pizzas, salads and other entrees are also good. Wolfgang Puck knows how to do it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent! For a girls weekend in Vegas I had tried to cut down on pizza and other unhealthy foods but when we got there, all bets were off. So on our last night we headed over towards Aria and had gluten free pizza at this awesome place. The restaurant is located in a mall between the Aria and Cosmo, which is probably the only negative because it doesn't offer any cool views of the hotels or the Strip. But the food was worth it. We shared 3 pizzas and a dish of pasta- we were five super hungry, sunburned and recently pizza-deprived girls. Oh and we started with a burrata and prosciutto appetizer. Everything was delicious, Wolfgang definitely knows how to make great gluten free pasta and pizza crust. Perfect amount of chewiness, even my non-gluten free friends thought it tasted like the real deal.  We split just a basic tomato based rigatoni pasta, but it was so good for being so simple. And then had a tomato basil, Italian meat and sausage/broccolini pizza. I think my favorite was the the tomato basil but all three were great, I was surprised that the sausage and broccolini flavors complimented each other and totally worked. I tend to like more veggie pizza versus meat, which is why I liked the first one best but meat lovers would be more than pleased with the options here. Can't wait to come back and indulge in this pizza again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Our best dining experience in Vegas so far! A great upscale atmosphere without ridiculous prices like most places along the strip. We had the Margherita pizza, Sausage pizza, and the bruschetta and everything was amazing! Our server Tony was so nice and made us feel like we were the only guests in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good. Great service, too. I got the margherita pizza and my husband got spaghetti and meatballs. So seriously delicious. Nice and simple too. Out waiter was very nice and attentive as well. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of my best meals in Vegas. Our waiter was Cabel and he was great. Very attentive and knowledge. Here is why I would recommend this restaurant  1. The service: attentive and knowledgeable  2. The food. So many great options that even if they aren't on the menu they will offer to make it for you. 3. Environment and atmosphere: very sophisticated and posh   I would recommend the spaghetti it was so good. The pizza, goat cheese platter and ravioli are also good."}
{"text":"Lunch with the girls  Shared duck confit pizza, Cesar salad and lasagna with a pitcher of white sangria.  The duck confit pizza was interesting because it's something I never seen made That was used as a pizza topping but it wasn't so bad. Some duck confit, Greens and freshly grated cheese. The lasagna was made tasty and good size. Very soft and fully flavor. Nothing special with the salad a typical Cesar salad that you can't go wrong with. Topped the whole meal together with freshly light white sangria was yummy!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in here for lunch a few times when I've been in the area. Very nice open air location in The Shops at Crystals.  I usually get one of their lunch specials which includes:  1) Caesar Salad, Creamy Garlic Dressing, Crouton, Anchovy  2)  Spaghetti Pomodoro, Tomato Concassé, Basil  3)  Tiramisu, Mascarpone Mousse  All three for just $25.  The service is always quick and the food is always spot on.  Great job and I'll see you next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had a buy one, get one My Vegas reward. Arrived around 11. We were the only ones at the restaurant when we were seated. I ordered a small ceasar salad to start. It was very good and perfect size for a starter. It had anchovies on top which I love.   For entrees I had the burrata ravioli and my husband had spaghetti and meatballs, both full size portions, there is an option to order half portions. My ravioli were good, got about 9 of them which is perfect for lunch. My husband's was a huge portion with 3 large meatballs. He liked it but could not finish it.   Our waiter was adequate, nothing special about the service.  Our bill with buy one get one was 33 dollars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is calm and serene, the decorations are appropriate, servers are nice and the quality of the food is what you would expect from Wolfgang Puck. The major problem I have here is with using the discount cards that are affiliated with this restaurant and the managerial staff's lack of acknowledgement for such.   My wife and I came in to have lunch and ordered from their prix fixe lunch menu. Halfway through our meal, we were told that the 30% off discount we showed our waiter would not apply to that menu since the prices were fixed before. Typically I understand this, but when this is not advertised and is the sole reason why you purchased the card, this mistake should not fall on the cost of the consumer. Technically, this can be classified as entrapment, as we were given no fair warning of a selective discount, and not one single printed advertisement says discounts cannot be applied.   When speaking with management, we were told they \"don't control what the vendors write\" (even though multiple other restaurants have restrictions printed on the same ad), and \"we need to go to the website for the fine print\" (who does that, and how would we know to do that?) I've done advertising before, I've been in management before- trust me, you've got a lot more control in what's printed because it's technically illegal to have a vendor falsely advertise for you including rearrangement of context and content of advertisements.  This is very unfortunate because the quality of the food we reluctantly paid full price for was excellent, and the staff working there who have no say in the advertising were sublime. I do recommend coming here, but be forewarned if you carry any of the discount cards. My review stands, at least until they can correct their mistake and not blame the consumer for their advertising oversight."}
{"text":"Wow!! The food was delicious! We had Endive Salad & Bruschetta for starters. For main dishes we has Mushroom pizza, Salmon & Eggplant Parmesan. Everything was really good and done to perfection. One of the best eggplant-Parmesan we had & the pizza.... Amazing!!! Quality ingredients and perfectly made thin crust.    The service is pretty good too. Professional & patient waiters. Relaxed atmosphere. A tip: go to one of the 'Half-Price Food/Show Tickets' stands/kiosks on the strip & purchase the %20 off coupon for the restaurant. It will save you a few bucks.."}
{"text":"Yummy spot! Grabbed a quick bite with my boyfriend and we loved everything we ordered! It was happy hour so we sat by the bar and enjoyed watching a soccer game. I drank a pitcher of white wine sangria myself and it was so refreshing and sweet! We split a half margarita pizza, half pepperoni. The wood oven pizza that had the perfect crust and just enough wood taste in each bite. I also ordered a salad that was part of the special-- it had plum and nuts... UNREAL! The only complaint I have is that I wasn't a fan of the cheese. I think it was called borgota cheese??? It was a like a very creamy mozzarella? Anyways overall loved this place!"}
{"text":"Pizza here was great. It was really nice inside the Crystals Shopping center. Eating inside Crystals made me feel like I was a high roller's wife spending the big bucks. Even though Wolfgang Puck's is actually very reasonable in pricing. I would absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"The family and I really enjoyed dinner here.  Fantastic, friendly, well-timed service. My wife had the clam linguine and the pasta was cooked perfectly, the clams (a great portion) were so fresh, and the sauce was light and very tasty.  I had the veal raviolis with mushrooms, and it was so good I mopped up the sauce with bread."}
{"text":"I think it's safe to say that we had a flawless experience here. It's located inside the Crystal Shops and is very convenient if you're staying in the Aria like we were. We quickly made a reservation, since we got to the hotel and checked in with just enough time to grab food and head over to MGM Grand to get our tickets for the JT concert that night. There were no problems getting reservations with such short notice.   The hostess was extremely friendly. She seated us right away and made small talk. When she and our waiter heard we were going to the concert, they assured us they would expedite our food and make sure we got out of there as soon as possible. They weren't kidding! The service was so fast that we ended our meal with a little time to spare and had time to finish our drinks and relax for a bit.   As far as drinks go, we ordered some dirty vodka martinis, and they were great! super strong and dirty enough to not realize how strong they were!   For our meals, we split the eggplant parmesan and the Roasted eggplant, garlic spinach, and fresh mozzarella pizza. Both meals were absolutely delicious and they were the perfect portions - we were full AND didn't have to worry about leftovers. Even the pasta that the eggplant parm came with was delicious!   Overall, had a great experience. Would definitely go back if I was staying on the strip next time!"}
{"text":"In the Crystals shopping center in City Center... the restaurant opens into the mall.  The music was strangely loud but mr. boyfriend thought it appropriate while I thought jazz would do.  TVs by the bar (which we could see from our table); happy hour at the bar; and a pleasant wait staff.  The ravioli was delicious and served fresh from the kitchen.  It was served at the same time at the pizza which appeared to be sitting out too long (soggy crust!).  I wouldn't order the pizza next time, but try another dish.  The red sangria was good.  An easy quick (open late) dinner location in Vegas that isn't crawling/packed to the brim/noisy."}
{"text":"this is our second time to eat here prior to playing a charity poker tournament with Tony Stewart's race team.  I love the ahi tune and my husband ordered a pizza that was unbelievable crispy and delicious.  We always eat at the bar and it took awhile to get service or anyone's attention, but once we did, the server was attentive and continued to refill our iced teas.  For the price the best place to eat in the MGM."}
{"text":"Wow. Cucina was so disappointing. My expectations were definitely high for a well reviewed restaurant by Wolfgang Puck in Vegas. Walking into the City Center mall, I could tell the ambiance would not be the best but the hostess and servers who greeted us helped bring back a nice restaurant feel.  Service was always friendly and helpful but definitely a little slow. I did up my rating from 2 to 3 stars because of how helpful everyone here was to our group from recommending drinks to walking us through dishes on the menu.  With good service but a mediocre environment, the food could have really made this place stand out. Sadly, it was around the same as a slightly higher end chain American-Italian restaurant (think Magiano's, Buca, Brio, etc). The pastas were overcooked and the pizza were soggy. Sauces were watery and under seasoned. Fortunately meats were well cooked and portions were decently sized (for Vegas).  Considering all the great food in this city, it would be hard for me to ever return to Cucina or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here a week ago while visiting. For past 5 years this place is always on my list when I arrive. Brought some friends and it service was way off. Long wait for a table as half the restaurant was closed. We were told they didn't have enough staff. Then while we waited for sat at the bar. When we checked back with hostess she had decided to take us off the lust because we were at the bar!  More waiting. My friends so aggravated. Table service slow also. So disappointed in one of my old favorites."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had! Seriously sooo good, and I eat a lot of pizza. They have all day happy hour in the bar. You can get a personal pizza for only $7 as well as some other items. They also have a delicious white wine sangria on their happy menu as well. Or you can get the Vegas dining card and get 30% off. We went 2 days in a row for lunch it was that good."}
{"text":"Really great food at Reasonable prices and attentive service.  Stopped in for a lunch with a colleague and couldn't believe how quick we got in during the CES show and right in the middle of lunch. We ordered a pizza, a bowl of minestrone soup, a salad and the cheese ravioli. All great portion sizes at great prices. Served Hot and fresh to the table. As busy as it was the waiter was attentive to refills, asking if we needed more items, pre bussing the table and more. I would recommend to anyone Looking for a great Italian lunch. Located inside the crystals shops next to Aria hotel."}
