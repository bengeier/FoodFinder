{"text":"Breakfast Burritos are bomb.com! Stumbled upon this place by accident on a Sun morning. Ordered the bacon breakfast burritos (egg, bacon, potato, and cheese) and they were delish.  Food took a while to come out but worth the wait. Red salsa was really good. Green salsa/avocado mix was spicy and tasty. I would def recommend and go back myself."}
{"text":"Food is awesomely delicious! Homemade tortillas, delicious salsa, and great tripas! The one thing that would help this restaurants reputation is the customer service at the register."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Giving this place 5 stars because the food is bomb and affordable. For $10 you get a smoked chicken, the best beans and rice, and homemade tortillas, with some awesome salsas. Stop by on the weekend when they smoke the birds out front. And definitely  get take-out, neighborhood and ambience isn't the best."}
