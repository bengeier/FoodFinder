{"text":"This little place is amazing! I came in one Saturday and was welcomed by two men who're really enthusiastic. I ordered their steak entree (bandeja paisa) which comes with soup, sausage, fried egg, avocado, rice, plantains, bacon and a little piece of what I think is a dumpling. The portion was huge! And very tasty. I also got some baked goods which were all very delicious. Buñuelos, alfahores, empanadas just to name a few. You won't be disappointed. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Everything I tried was excellent! The steak patacones con carne was to die for. also coffee is 10/10! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Aurora and I was feeling something sweet and small after my meeting. From searching and reading other yelpers' reviews, I decided to check out this place! This bakery is hidden in a relatively huge strip plaza and you can really miss if you aren't  looking for this place specifically. However, there's a huge Columbian flag at the front of the shop, which definitely makes it stand out more.   I went in at lunch time (~12:30pm) and there were a lot of people. The bakery is really small though as it only has about 3 small tables. At that time, all 3 tables were occupied. I looked around to see what they offered but unfortunately, they were all in Spanish and it didn't have any English descriptiosn of the baked goods. After 5 minutes of browsing, the owners (husband and wife) introduced their bakery to me and told me what they offered. In one window, they had Columbian pastries, such as empanadas, Almojábana (Columbian cheese bread), guava pastry, and other buns. In another window, they had more traditional western cakes like carrot cake, nanaimo bars, etc.  Even though the husband was really friendly and was happy to tell me all their items, I didn't really like how they didn't have price tags to the food. It felt very inconvenient and awkward when I have to ask them what was in each item and how much each thing costs.   I bought several things to try: Their specialty cheese bread, beef empanadas, Almojábana, and Almojábana con Bocadillo. They told me that Columbians love guava and dulce de leche, but I wasn't really feeling it that day.   The cheese bread was absolutely DELICIOUS! Actually, it is a challah sweet bread that is filled with slices of slightly salty cheese and then sprinkled with more cheese. There's also an option of just buying the challah bread without cheese. I was told that this is great for french toast. The beef empanadas was huge and had a lot of feeling. It was very tasty! There wasn't anything special for the Almojábana (Columbian cheese bread). It is what it sounds like - a round bread that is cheese flavoured. The other deep fried Columbia patty like items (one was chicken, the other was beef) were also very delicious!  It was not oily at all, which is a bonus in my books!  There are also sandwiches that you can order, as written on the blackboard in the back counter. They also serve traditional Columbian meals on Saturdays and Sundays and it changes every weekend!   I will definitely come back to try other items such as churros! And of course the Columbia meals!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, cozy with warm service!!  Excellent breakfast and coffee cooked with heart. Reasonable price ! Love their sweet pastry.
