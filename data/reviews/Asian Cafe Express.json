{"text":"First off, if you like ambience and decor, don't go here. If you like good Asian and Pacific Rim food, then do go here. These people do not, and I mean do not, f**k around with the good food they serve. What they lack in service, sometimes you got to wait longer than it takes to grow the food, they more than make up in what they do right and thats make good food from their respective origins. To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day. Tip: When you go in and see one table, get it. Smile at the lady, maybe even slightly bowing and make for that table. It can get crowded. Oh, and lots and lots of TOGO orders here for those who like TV or children with their food, hence the wait."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Great value and friendly service. Highly recommend. Love the Hong Kong Coffee/Tea.  One of the best Asian Restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Tried it after reading all the raving reviews. There's no doubt, it's the cheapest Chinese I've come across in the East Valley. As far as flavor, far from the best."}
{"text":"Their menu is huuuuge! I had the curry rice with chicken, which was... interesting. The curry sauce was from a mix and not at all spicy, but the potatoes in the dish were steak fries that were worked into the sauce. Overall I liked it, but probably wouldn't order again. My partner got the beef lo-mein which was quite greasy. After conversing with the people who recommended the place, apparently they only go there for the wonton soup, so I think we will try that next time, and maybe one of their $3.79 plates. 

It would be nice if the place had a restroom."}
{"text":"The Asian Cafe Express gave me the best Asian experience I have had in years.  The food was excellent and the service was as on point as it could have been.  I have since gone back 4 times and the experience and customer service has remained consistent and Asian as per my preferance.  I'd highly reccomend this establishment."}
{"text":"This restaurant has won best in Phoenix several times, and deserves to win many MANY more. Excellent food with a huge menu to choose from, awesome soups and noodle dishes and ridiculously inexpensive!! I knew the place was authentic when I walked in and saw items on the wall written in English and Chinese. The ulitmate confirmation came from a friend of mine who lived in China for many years and he told it me it was just like the food he ate while there. I have been going here for 5 years and have been exploring my way through the menu and have yet to be dissapointed.   The ambiance is very simple ad it can get loud, but the food, the staff  the drive (for those not in the East Valley) are SOOOOO worth it!!  GO!!!"}
{"text":"Where did I end up eating? The reviews here do not match the atrocity of food I just ate from Asian Cafe Express.    The lo mein was so oily and the fried rice was crunchy....an 'uncooked' kind of crunchy!  I ordered the family special with orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  

They did not put ay sauce or give me a side of sauce for my sweet and sour chicken, and the orange chicken was mushy and plain. 

Everything was so disgusting, I ended up throwing it away after a few bites.  I was very disappointed after having such high expectations with the reviews.  I will never go back and the only word of mouth campaign I'm running is \"Do not go here!\""}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Definitely my go to for Chinese food(: so fast and tasty! The coffee milk tea is the shizz and they are extremely inexpensive and give big portions! You definitely get more than you pay for!"}
{"text":"The wait is a lil long when it's busy but it's worth the wait....I live there food so amazing the employees know us already that's how u know we are frequent customers yumummmy"}
{"text":"Don't let the food court-sounding name deter you. This is some of the most authentic, delicious, and inexpensive Chinese food in the East Valley. As others have said, the first few pages of the menu are Americanized specialties (kung pao, sweet and sour, etc.) but deeper into the menu you'll find Hong Kong style dishes. You may not understand what you're ordering (I didn't), but just go for it. Your sense of adventure will be rewarded (that sounds like a fortune cookie-- and a good \"in bed\" one now that I think about it)."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  At their prices, of course it's not beautifully decorated.  The waitress took our order promptly and the food arrived quickly.  What do these people expect?  It's in a shopping mall that's pretty empty and all the parked cars seem to be at ACE's.  I don't know what authentic Hong Kong cuisine is.  I do know that their stir fried fish with yellow chives was so delicious that we returned a week later to try the Hong Kong fish which we also loved.  After a small bowl of preserved veggie and pulled pork soup, one order of fish was perfect for two adults to share for lunch w/o leftovers.  We drove about 25 miles on each of two visits and will be back probably with friends in tow.  They will think we're nuts to drive so far but that's what we snowbirds like to do.  

Across the street there is a huge Asian supermarket.  What a surprise!  Each aisle has ethnic specialities from a different country.  I wouldn't know how to prepare them even if I could read the labels but it's very interesting.  Who knew there were so many Asian people here in the desert?  A lot of them seem to like the Asian Cafe Express too.  It won't be long til our next visit to ACE, the place with the wonderful Hong Kong chef."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and decided to put our trust in Yelp for Chinese.  Short 20 minute drive from downtown Phoenix.  Very family friendly and one of the biggest menu selections I have ever experienced.  The staff was very polite and attentive.  The food was excellent and well portioned.  The total for 4 entrees, rice, and drinks was $26."}
{"text":"Really good food, and very cheap. Fried tofu is excellent, steam chicken with ginger sauce is very soft and juicy, chinese broccoli with garlic is very delicious. Very fast service too!."}
{"text":"I had the large orange chicken plate with white rice yesterday and the meal was phenomenal. Truly authentic. Try it! The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"I have been to eat at ACE three times and had take-out from them once. Every time has been wonderful. The servers are extremely polite and attentive. I never had to ask for more water because they were always filling my glass without interrupting my conversations. The food options are extensive! The menu has a lot to choose from, and I like pork dishes the most, so it was nice to see that I had options when it came to those. I ordered the 10 dumplings for $2.99, and I had them make them with pork. They are a great deal. They may not fill up someone who has a large stomach, but they are the perfect amount for my tiny appetite and my wallet. I also tried the twice cooked pork, and it was good. It reminded me a bit of the kind of food one might get at Panda Express in terms of texture, but the redeeming quality was the sauce. It was sweet and spicy, and it really made the dish. Overall, this is a great Asian place that offers a lot of options to choose from for a good price. I'm definitely going to miss being able to walk down the street to eat here now that I've moved!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want chinese food. Beats your chain companies that are overpriced. Here you will get better and cheaper food. Bring your own sriracha sauce because they don't have any."}
{"text":"Normally the food here is to die for so I'm going to give this a fiver. Kung Pao Chicken and Dry Chow Fun are always a hit. Last night we ordered the Satay tofu and vegetables and it was definitely not what we expected. It came with vermicelli noodles and a watery chicken broth. We were expecting it to be in peanut sauce but was far from it. We wont be getting that again but we also paired it with Chicken Fried Rice which was a whopping 5 dollars. I'm not going to lie, this Fried Rice was the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Chinese/ Hong Kong style cuisine!!! Don't you dare order off the AZ menu, try something legit off of the Hong Kong menu :)"}
{"text":"Cheap Homemade Chinese Comfort Food!!

The price is unbeatable, selections was wide and covered most main region of Chinese Cuisines, and the flavor is spot on!!

My favorite, surprisingly, is the salty fish chicken fried rice. I don't normally order fried rice in restaurant and tend to go for authentic flavors. But, this fried rice is authentic and flavorful. Their hot pot dish with tofu and fish was also a must have! 

I have not try it yet, but I heard you can also bring fresh seafood that you bought from the market (with recipe) to them. They will prep and cook the items for you with a small fee. 

Can't wait to go back for some fried rice and seafood!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I found ACE upon arriving in Mesa for a temporary work assignment of about 6 months.  We love this place.  If you're looking for fancy, this ain't it!  But if you're looking for a clean, decent, VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service, this is the place!  It's in a strip mall right next to a Subway deli if that gives you an idea of the ambiance.  It's usually full of Asian people which is always a good sign to me.  There are zillions of items on the menu, and while we've only tried a few of them, we have yet to try something that we didn't think was delicious.  The Beef Chow Fun with gravy is my favorite, but we also like the Chicken with Fresh and Black Mushrooms.  Sit down, or take out, you can't lose in this place."}
{"text":"ACE is my go-to Chinese restaurant.  It's a joint and reminds me of the Chinese restaurants where I grew up, in NYC.  It's totally chaotic most of the time, the place could be cleaner, the portions are large, aesthetics are not a priority, the menu is extensive, it's cheap, and the food is consistently good to very good.

This is solid 4 star food with prices from yesteryear.  The fried squid is about $9 for a large plate, and is perfectly fried and seasoned.  The seafood chow fun is delicious.  It comes with a light sauce, the noodles are well executed,  the seafood is fresh and plentiful and it's a huge bargain at under $10.  Sometimes it could use a little more salt, but that isn't a problem to me.  The Chinese style soup noodles with Shanghi bok choi, shrimp and pork wontons, and egg noodles in a pork broth are delicious and another bargain at under $8.  

The prices here are so reasonable I hardly look at them, amazing for yours truly, as I am a foodie bargain hunter.  Some might find the food here a little bland, but remember this is basically Cantonese food, one of the least spiced of China's eight schools of cooking.  ACE will always turn the heat up if you ask. 

Overall, this is a solid Chinese restaurant with many Asian patrons, a good sign. The food is consistent and the prices are easy on the wallet.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal! Food was flavorful and the sizes were excellent. Also, you can't beat the pricing!  My only complaint was the greasy onion rings. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, large portions, low prices. The service and atmosphere is also really welcoming and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yum yum!!! First time dining here and food is wonderful and employees friendly and attentive. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is really good (when you know what you've ordered) and prepared fresh which you can judge by the freshness of the meat and the veggies. Also it's not so heavy on your wallet!!"}
{"text":"Fast, tasty and cheap ... what can you ask more 

I have been hearing quite a bit about this place on their Hong-Kong style food ... especially the wonton noodle ... and I am glad I did. Now I have found a place to fill my hong-kong-ese crave :)

The wonton noodle was pretty authentic and the \"dry fried beef noodle\" was tasty too...
But I will avoid their french toast there next time ... totally different from what you would get in HK"}
{"text":"I spent my first year in Phoenix feeling totally hopeless about ever finding a decent Chinese restaurant. Then, Asian Cafe Express was discovered! I've dined in once and gotten carry-out twice and each time the food has been fabulous! I highly recommend the Creamy Chicken and Corn Soup (disclaimer: I add a little salt to it), Chili Sauce Chicken Dumplings (these are actually really salty - which I like), Beef and Vegetables with Brown Rice (SO good), and Boba Tea! The menu can be a bit overwhelming at first (as there are actually menus within the menu...if that makes any sense!), but now that I know what I want I don't have to worry. Haha. I'd be interested in trying other dishes, but seriously, the beef and vegetables are so delicious I can't bring myself to stray from them yet. I've even had leftovers that tasted better the next day. Lastly, the portion sizes and prices are great! This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in the valley for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have way better Chinese style Western food in Los Angeles.
I will say half of the dishes in its menu are soso or not good. Half of them meets my expectation.
The owner/chef is always proud of his cooking skill. He is too arrogant like a frog lives inside the well but has never been the outside world.
Actually for some of his dishes, I can make better than he does. 
I give it  2 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese diner food...best I've had this side of San Gabriel Valley...just ignore the cheesy name and stripped down fast food furnishings

If you're not sure that Chinese diner food is like...think great stir fried noodle dishes (like the beef chow hoa in the picture above) and old school Chinese interpretation of Western dishes like baked pork chop smothered with tomato sauce on rice (check out the other picture above).

Michael (the chef) and his wife (up front) are friendly folks, so go ahead and chat them up for recommendation about what's good here.  Their best dishes are usually posted on the walls rather than in either of the 2 printed menu...go figure."}
{"text":"I love Asian Cafe Express!! I order take out ALOT from here & everyone is always friendly even on a busy night. 
I've never had a bad experience here & will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"We ate here last week due to all the good reviews. The staff was friendly. However their food is tailored too much toward the American taste.

We ordered Hot and Sourer Soup: Not the normal Chinese style. Strange vegetables and very little tofu. Not bad but a very different flavor. 

Kung Pow Chicken: It came in a very nice display of chicken and vegetables, however the sauce was way too sweet and bland.
MaPo Tofu: Now where near what true MaPo Tofu is Lacking in Tofu again and ground Pork. Again not much flavor. 

Portions are large and prices are low. But food taste is more important.

May return and try something else and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Below average food, nonexistent service, and FILTHY dining room. The suction cup shower door handle that was being used as the front door handle should have tipped me off to the quality of this establishment.  Please look under the tables at the two inches of black grime on the floor along the wall, and food splatters on the wall next to the table and ask yourself when this place was cleaned and why are you still sitting there.
I will never go again. The wait was so long my kid was asking if I had snacks! I regret staying and eating, I was so hungry, and we even didn't get everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Very good food, with amazing value, we ordered the 36$ combo and got enough food for 2 meals. Great place"}
{"text":"Finally! A well priced chinese cafe style place in Phoenix that is actually good!!!!!

To start off, don't expect a fancy setting or anything. It's straight up, no frillz asian style cafe decor. It's in an excellent location as it is across from the Mekhong Plaza, however, it's kind of hidden inside this plaza so you would have to look hard for it.

When you enter, you have all of their featured menus plastered on the wall. Awesome- shows nice pictures of the dish, name and price of it. It's good for folks who may not be familiar with certain dishes and would like a picture of what they are ordering.

The 1st thing that caught my eye was the Hong Kong menu. They actually served FRIED MILK!!!! For all those that wonder what the heck is fried milk, it's basically solidified milk and then they use flour to coat around the milk and fry it. It is a really interesting dish, probably not for everyone as the taste is probably more of an acquired dish. This dish however is really complex to make, so I was somewhat sceptical that they can make Fried Milk at this cafe. When the order came in, I was really surprised by the quality of it. The flour was not too thick, the milk inside was still soft enough and when you bit into it, the flavored gushed into your mouth. I loved it! Dip the fried milk into the sweet mayo dip and you have a winner!

I also ordered another great dish, Smooth beef with egg over rice. Their beef was perfectly fluffy ( I can tell they use the Baking Soda to soften up the meat first as the texture of it is very uniquely soft) and the thick white sauce with egg white was the perfect mixture over the rice. This dish was cheap, only $6 for such a large dish. 

Their entire menu was generally from $5-9, so lot's of options to choose from. I am very happy to know this place exists and that Phoenix is slowly getting up to speed to the Los Angeles Chinatown quality.

Highly recommend this cafe if you want some good sized asian food at a budget price!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to eat in Mesa and decided to have Chinese. Upon finding and entering the cafe we saw that the interior was not very nice. But I ordered the beef and eggplant rice plate in
Brown sauce and it blew me away! I'm not a big fan of eggplant but these cooks can make anything taste good! At a cheap price too! The proportions are huge which provide tasty left overs. They had oolong tea which was  nice and very authentic food. A must when in Mesa. The service is very nice and friendly too. Overall an extremely good experience and can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"awesome food for the americanized or the autentic alike.  they use great ingredients and there taste on the america chinese cusine has a yummy differentiating taste!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Service just ok. Took forever to get helped and waitress seemed very disinterested but food came out fast then it took forever to get check."}
{"text":"The fiod is great. They really need to expand the space, . Its pretty crowded. Service was fast and friendly ."}
{"text":"Excellent value and huge portions. I really like the combo fried rice and the Mongolian beef. This place is kind of a hole in the wall, but the food is very tasty. It is always busy, particularly on weekend evenings."}
{"text":"Best Bang for your buck no doubt!  lunch specials, come check it out."}
{"text":"This has to be my all-time favorite restaurant. We order off the Hong Kong menu and we have never left the restaurant unsatisfied. Everything we try is excellent and has a very authentic taste. I hope to try every dish on the menu. The owner (or maybe it's the head chef?) is a very friendly older man who comes out from the back sometimes and says hi to people. This isn't the nicest looking place but since the food is so great and the prices are way low, I'll keep come back forever."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good chinese food after eating all american and mexican cuisine for our trip  found this place through yelp.  If you are looking for good authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go.  Good menu selection and reasonable priced,"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. The first time I went, I returned four more times that week with various friends. It's super affordable, as well. The staff are very friendly, and it's a great place for larger groups to eat. It's also a good sign that it tends to be filled with Chinese people. I would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????This place very good food."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, delicious, and cheap!!! I'm blown away every time I eat here. Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time, but it definitely won't be the last. A co-worker and I stopped in for lunch and to try it out. He had the Japanese Beef and Broccoli and I had the Chicken fried rice. I'm not a fan of cooked broccoli so I didn't taste his. But it sure did look good. He said it was delicious. My fried rice was some of the best I have ever had. The portions for both of us were huge, so we brought the rest back to take home with us. The place doesn't stand out from the street view, so you have to be in the lookout for it in a strip mall. Not a huge place, especially when we saw the lunch crowd come in a fill the place up. But, it's not so small you feel cramped either. Prices were reasonable and lunch for the two of us was under $20."}
{"text":"My friend Norm and I went to dinner here tonight. I was happy since I just passed my entry exam for classes this fall. The artwork is exquisite and the food did not disappoint. Very authentic and VERY reasonable. Friendly staff and amazing variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Their eggplant and chicken is amazing. Also try the hong kong style milk coffee. They also have a wide collection of asian dishes."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place and it was better than I expected. The food tasted very good. For the price and portion size this place is the real deal. Me and my 3 kids ate and were stuffed for only $16.00. That's beats any chain and tastes way better. I can't wait to try something off the Hong Kong side of the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered salt & pepper squid, chinese broccoli shrimp, and beef Chow Fun. We enjoyed the food, also they give a large portion. We especially liked the Chinese Broccoli Shrimp. The sauce was tasty, and the broccoli was exceptional. 

Unfortunately we were not completely satisfied with the salt & pepper squid. It did not taste fresh, and we thought it was frozen. BUT they handled the situation remarkably, and our server immediately apologized. She also offered us another dish, as she quickly reported this to the chef.

We are not certain we will come back soon, but I give this restaurant 4 stars because of the phenomenal service."}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express is our absolute favorite go-to place for cheap, delicious chinese food.  We have brought several groups of friends there, and they have become returning customers as well.  We love the lo mein, orange chicken, and mongollian beef."}
{"text":"I LOVE the service in this place. You can chat with the waiters however you want, and they can literally remember your name and your last orders. Nevertheless, the foods are alright. Speaking as a hongkonger, I suggest the HoFun needs improvement. And prices are fair enough. One star down to the foods."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum. Best food I have had in a long time. This will be my go to place when I am in town."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Arizona.
Well keep in mind that they do not have the best decorative taste but the food here is absolutely delicious. Traditional Chinese food cooked the way it should be cook. They didn't alter the food style to try to accommodate to the main stream market. 
Food here is absolutely authentic. I can't believe I never tried this place before."}
{"text":"After running 17 miles I would have ate anything.

But, I got lucky and my family took me to the best Chinese place I've been to in years. 

The noodles, chicken, shrimp and pot stickers were delicious. The service can be crazy because this place gets busy. The prices are great. I want to learn about Chinese culture after this remarkable experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants in Arizona that I have been to. Of course you can't expect it to be as good as those in Hong Kong. They have 2 menus: one with authentic Chinese/Hong Kong style food, and another with American \"Chinese\" food (eg. egg roll, orange chicken, beef broccoli, etc etc, which are what the low rating reviews were describing. why would you even eat American food at a Chinese restaurant anyway) You can buy your own fresh seafood from the Mekong supermarket across the street and this restaurant will cook it the way you want it (which is awesome because this makes it so much cheaper than seafood at other Chinese restaurants with their own fish tanks)"}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese restaurant around this area and the price is really reasonable. I would recommend this place to any one who likes varieties of authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wish I would have looked at the reviews on Yelp! before I tried this place.  I work really close, but thought this place looked like a typical dingy tasteless chinese take-out restaurant... so I had no idea what to expect.

The pictures of the dishes on the wall threw me off to start... and the saran-wrapped chairs really made me wonder.  However, for $3.33 they gave me a huge amount of spicy chicken, which I barely could finish (but wasn't going to waste!) As far as value, this kicks the kung pao out of Panda or any chain Chinese... 

There are so many dishes here it would take a year to try all of them.  I like americanized asian, but if you love authentic chinese they have that here as well, as everyone around me was eating things I have never seen before...

I'm never going to Panda again."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had ever. It is legit and super cheap. Always well worth the $5 I spend for the 2-3 meals it lasts me."}
{"text":"Food - Inexpensive and good for the price. I can feed 4 grown men for $20 and nobody get sick. Can't beat it. I am a huge sucker for orange chicken and this place has it!

Service - They are super cute here. Very nice and helpful. They don't roll their eyes when you look at the menu and go \"uuuuummmmmmmm\". Fun people. They will recognize you by the 2nd time you come in. Great place.

Notes: At lunch Combo Fried Rice is a stupid amount of food for $5."}
{"text":"Being within walking distance of this place is what I will miss the most when I move across town. Pages and pages of menu items, but most of the time I just get something off of the first page - the \"special bowl.\" It is a pretty decent amount of really good food for $3.98. There are about 15 different options on this all day, every day deal and I have yet to be disappointed. I got it to-go for the first time today and I think they gave me even more than when I eat there as the standard sized to go box was overflowing with rice, chicken, and vegetables. Check out the appetizers, too. 10 steamed dumplings for $2.99 is practically a meal in itself! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! We always get the family meal with 5 choices. It is a huge amount and we usually have leftovers.  Orange chickenand the general are our 2 top favorites."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the valley, about a year ago, and have tried many MANY Chinese restaurants. Good bad and ugly, Asian cafe express is the best! Food is always spot on and the price... Unbeatable. Two can eat a large meal and have two full leftover meals for 25 bucks (that's with a $5 tip). Don't let the noisy and somewhat uncomfortable first impression turn you away, the service, value and quality are unmatched in my experience. Any fried chicken, orange, generals, any lo mein, rice, egg rolls, spring rolls you really can't go wrong here. Oh, and don't let me forget that the menu is longer than a Tolkein novel.. GET DOWN!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Chinese food in the Mesa/Tempe area! We love their Mongolian dishes, vegetable fried rice, kung pao, brown rice, Etc etc! Always great service & amazing prices!"}
{"text":"The food is outstandingly good!! when ever im on a budget this is the place to go for your Chinese fix. becoming a regular at this Asian cafe was a good choice. always being greeted and well taken care of. kudos to all the hard working servers. Very inexpensive and lots for your money! i always have to ask for a take home box! very good! thanks! id very much recommended the Chinese Garlic Broccoli and Chicken Fried Rice!!"}
{"text":"Economical, fast, good chinese food.  Did I mention economical?  You cannot beat the prices here."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I'm blown away by the quality of food and staff. Prices can't be beat. If you can't make up your mind, try the family style menu option 3-5 dishes with rice and lo mein gives great options and more food than you can shake a stick at. 

Red bean tea super tasty!
Love Mongolian chicken!
Spring rolls and red chili chicken wings are amazing appetizers!

Fun side note you can bring in your own fish/chicken/duck if you like and they will prep and cook it for you (no idea where to get this hit up the Asian market on the other side of Dobson)."}
{"text":"I've been to the Asian Cafe Express four times now and I can't help the fact that the prices are so incredibly affordable for the amount of food that you get.  $10 will get you a large dish of fried rice at $5 and an entree (mongolian beef, orange chicken, beef and brocolli, etc) for $5 and change or $7 and change.  The food is so good.  If you're going for the ambiance, you won't find it.  The restaurant is something out of the 60's 70s or 80s with plastic on most of the chairs (other than the booths).  But, I could care less.  I'm not really focusing on the design -- it's mostly the friends I'm with and the food I'm eating.  If you're looking to spend $10 on food that will likely last you three days, it's a bang for your buck.  Check it out and you'll see."}
{"text":"When I'm in a quandry on what I want to eat, chinese is always at the top of my list. And the topper of that list is Asian Cafe Express or ACE as my friend Dave R and I call it. If it's your first time going there you might think to yourself, hmmm, so I order off the wall menu? They do have an expansive menu that not only has chinese food but also food from Singapore, Japan and Thai variations. I'm pretty much a simple guy to please, so chicken with vegetables is my choice. The chicken comes out tender and they use breast instead of thigh meat that a lot of other chinese places use. The vegetables still has that crunch to them and not the overdone limpness that you get at some places. The service is always excellent and quick. If you can get past the looks of the interior and just base it on the food, ACE is the Place. (I couldn't resist)"}
{"text":"I've been here seven or eight times now.  It's not close to where I live, but it's worth the drive.

This is a small strip mall  place with outdated decor and dirty windows.  But the food is amazing and the prices are great.  I am often the only non-Asian person in the room: a good sign I'm eating authentic dishes."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for lunch.  All of the food is very good.  They have both authentic and american type Chinese food (sweet n sour, orange chicken, etc).  Plus the price is AMAZING!  I've turned a lot of my co-workers onto this place.  If you are in the Mesa/Tempe area and want some good Chinese that's cheap you can't beat this joint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Even if the wait is long, and it normally is not, Its worth it. If your in a hurry call ahead. Food is amazing and the price is perfect for the portions. In my opinion this is the best \"fast\" Asian food in the valley."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! My boyfriend showed me this place when we first started dating we come at least once a week now, and they always know what we want its become a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the city... and thee WORST service in the state!

That's the best way to sum up this place. There isn't much that isn't said already in the vast amount of reviews for this place... Now I HATE bad service. I've been known to walk out or ask to see a manager if I get shitty service, but this place has such amazing food, it kind of works itself out. 

The first time I came here, it took over half an hour for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink (!) and then it took another 45 minutes for them to bring the food to us after we ordered. And what I hate is that the servers all have this American Diner from the 60s attitude like \"yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm coming, I'm coming. Whaddaya have?\" Geez, some fucking service with a smile please? In dining here a few times, this doesn't let up... even when the room is HALF FULL it will STILL take forever to be waited on and it will STILL take forever to get your food, I suggest bringing in some tacos from JITB as an appetizer. Also, protip: if you act like you're in a rush or suuuuper annoyed you'll get faster service; something I picked up on when some regulars at the next table over told me and my friend they do it all the time. 

Do NOT go here if you're in a rush, it's going to take at least an hour to dine here aaaaand about 15 minutes to eat all the delicious food!! My favorite meal is the Egg Drop Soup to start w/ Orange chicken & Hawaiian beef for the meal with egg friend rice HOLD the onions. perfect meal, less than $30 with enough left overs for a healthy midnight snack... okay 10:30PM snack!"}
{"text":"Not a Chinese food expert, in my younger day I would even avoid it at all costs but looking back I think that must have been the MSG. Now that you know that I will tell you this is one of the best Chinese food meals I have ever had. We had just returned to Phoenix from a long vacation and we knew there was no food in the house. So I Yelped and we decided to visit Asian Cafe Express. 

We all chose a meal but then decided to get the Family Meal. You can order 5 different entrees in addition to white rice, fried rice and lo mein. We ordered orange chicken, kung pao chicken, general chicken, sweet & sour chicken, and kung pao beef. I don't like deep fried or heavily breaded food so I didn't try those three but my kids were very happy.  The kung pao dishes were awesome, slightly spicy but I added more, tender chicken and beef and crunchy veggies, slightly sweet. The fried rice was so yummy - veggies and eggs. 

We were starving and ate a lot and still brought home at least 6 boxes of food. We had it for dinner and a bit for lunch the next day. 

The atmosphere is fine, not fancy, the mall has maybe one other business in it. The service was great. Definitely worth the drive for us."}
{"text":"This place is so authentic! I'm not Chinese but I have several Chinese friends that tell me this is the real deal :)
Delicious food... especially the beef and wonton stew, orange chicken and eggplant. Taro coconut and boba tea are very good too.
Besides the good food, I like the service and the prices! Soooooo cheap! Yummy"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the city! You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. My wallet loves the prices too!"}
{"text":"Despite the slower than usual service this place reminds me of really good Chinese food in SF. I would come here more often but it's usually a trek. 

Soups are super large. The egg drop and hot and sour are both really good. I think my favorite dish is the chow fun with the fish and white sauce. It's amazing... I have to tell myself not to eat the whole dish since they give you gigantic proportions. 

They also have pretty good bobba."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Portions were huge and the price perfect! The chili spare ribs and chicken wings are my favorite ! Will be a repeat customer !"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Food tastes great. You get plenty of food. There is plenty of room. All at affordable prices. This people know what they are doing and it is great! They could get some larger water glasses though."}
{"text":"I go here with 3-4 other friends, get the FAMILY MEAL, you pick out 3 entre's 2 sides and it feeds us all easily with some left overs. it's also only 20 bucks. it's amazing quality and extremely cheap when you get the family meal."}
{"text":"I am glad I stumbled across this place after going to a business appointment years ago.  This place has great Hong Kong/Canton-style food in a place that looks like it came from there - crappy tables and old lame dishes and those 70's style brown plastic glasses.  But the food is cheap and awesome.

Main dishes to get are the spicy chicken, Singapore-style fried noodles, Mongolian beef, any of the lo-mein, wonton soup noodle, and ask about any of the daily chinese veggies they pick up from the market.  The spicy-salted spareribs and 5-spice chicken wings are good for appetizers too.

If any of you have been to Gourmet House of Hong Kong, this is Michael Leung's new place in Mesa."}
{"text":"Good, but not great, Chinese food.  I don't really get why everyone is rating this place so high.  Sampled 4 different items, and all of them were good- but none of them were exceptional at all.  If I could gove half stars, I would give it 3.5."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with my adventurous boyfriend and roommate tonight for dinner! Let me start by saying I was extremely impressed. The staff was friendly and got our order in fairly quickly. Then when we opened the menu, all 3 of our mouths dropped when we saw how cheap each of the items were. We were already loving it! We ordered the Chili salt chicken wings, dumplings, salt and pepper fried squid, and orange chicken with fried rice. I honestly cannot tell you one bite I did not enjoy. I usually run into problems with this style of food because, let's just say I really enjoy salty food. And usually food associated with this type is really sweet. I was so happy to taste how flavorful each bite was!!! Again, raving about this place to all family members and friends.  Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food, really happy with my choice to eat here. Prices are outstanding as well. Always warms my heart that know there's someplace I can get a really great meal without emptying my wallet."}
{"text":"Great food. Just don't ever order pick up.. language barrier is too great.. they never know what I'm talking about unless I'm physically pointing at it on the menu. After 15 mins of trying to place an order, I just told her I'd go somewhere else, she responded, \"ok bye\" and hung up.. that's why you get 1 star."}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday around 4pm. There were four other tables, three of which were already served when we came in and one that was seated after us, a party of two looking to spend around $40. 

26 minutes later, and we still has not been asked our order. We had our menus closed and were waiting to spend our money. 

Alas, the Chinese wait staff served the Chinese customers who came in after us, so we ended up leaving and spending money elsewhere. 

If you can wait more than 26 minutes to be checked on, and tolerate differential service that appears based on skin color and appearance, maybe this place is for you. It's not for us and I've removed it from my restaurant rotation. We'll have no problem finding solid Asian fare in this town."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but I have no idea why this place has 4 stars. I have eaten here twice just to be sure before posting. I've ordered the famous chicken wings(way too greasy & salty), the eggplant chow fun, the combo fried rice, chicken lomein, orange chicken, broccoli beef and more but everything I've ordered has had a strange after taste and is so full of grease it is hardly enjoyable. If you fall for the 4 stars and do end up here the broccoli beef and lomein are ok but the lomein is greasy too. I will never eat here again. The service is slow. The food was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME! The flavors and preparation are on point. Service is SLOW, but for that great food, I'm willing to wait! And did I mentioned how CHEAP it is?
Looooove the \"Dry Satay Combo chow fun\""}
{"text":"Never disappoints- this is by far one of the most reliable Hong Kong eateries in the Mesa/Phx. area. 
Tonight was the Chile Pot Stickers along with Pepper Chicken over LoMien. Of course the OOLONG Tea served hot was steeped to perfection. 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"ACE, huh? what an apt acronym for this eatery...

my wife's been working late hours, and her job has been buying all her meals, so i've had the opportunity to go out of my way and sample what both yelp and the new times best of phoenix has to suggest. i was in the mesa area wednesday night and was real hungry after working out, so...

i can't believe i've never ever heard of this place before the 2010 best of phoenix issue. no one bothered to tip me off! i need to get some more savvy friends! maybe it's because it's not exactly in a high profile area? it's definitely in a weird corner of a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shopping center.

and when i walked inside? oh man, SO gritty. this is the kind of place i think of when i think of authenticity, when i think of dishes i'll crave again and again. the smell in the air got my stomach rumbling as did the plates on everyone's tables. wednesday night and this busy? and almost everyone inside was asian? and right off the light rail? and i didn't hear a record skip and the music stop when i walked in?

i picked up a menu and thumbed through it, but it was filled with just the usual dishes. where were all the hardcore dishes i've read about on yelp? since i was only getting a take-out order, i wasn't able to investigate if there was another menu with the real shit on it. since i had photo evidence it existed (thanks to all the yelpers who already know about this place), i ordered the beef with chinese broccoli and the beef chow fun, with gravy. i also ordered a taro coconut drink with tapioca to hold me over on the long drive back home. let me say it was real tough, driving all the way back to north phoenix with all that food making my car's insides smell all delicious.

my nose KNOWS! after getting home and setting up a plate, a couple of bites in and i was already texting friends in tempe about my new find. the beef chow fun is probably the BEST i've ever had. the noodles were excellent, the beef cooked expertly and the sauteed baby bok choi, also, delicious! chinese broccoli is a favorite of mine, and ACE's was GREAT. even those these two dishes are similar, they both had distinct flavors that made me very happy. even the taro coconut drink, with actual tapioca inside was so good, refreshing and mixed perfectly. the portions were HUGE as i had enough for lunch and dinner the next day, and it was also super affordable!

i may have found a new favorite chinese food spot, but why does it have to be in mesa? and why aren't there any amazingly great chinese food places in north phoenix?"}
{"text":"This place is popular w/ the overseas Chinese (and especially) of the college student variety... probably cuz the pricing is dirt cheap and gives them a bit of home.

It's a choice for Chinese food considering the plethora of Vietnamese offerings at the Mekong place across the street.  Service was slow on this full Friday night and did see a couple walk out, but the staff is super uber duper friendly (owner waitress to the young guy waiter).

HK Milk Tea -- better than most, I like mine cold.

Yellow Leek Bean Sprout Fish -- almost all sprout over leek, tasty but extremely oily.  Could of cut that down by half at least, was trying to drain the oil out.

Spicy Pork Noodle (on the wall pic) -- sweet and not very spicy, you'd like it if you're a fan of thick round white noodle dishes.

Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu pot --  best of the bunch.  Preserved salted fish is used sparingly to flavor the remaining ingredients."}
{"text":"By far one of the best in the valley if not THE best!  Their menu is huge, but we always order the family four pack for less than $40 and that seriously feeds a family of 7 and still have leftovers.  The food is SO good and everything tastes like it is perfectly seasoned and it's almost like you can taste the flavors of the pans they use with this light smokey taste a well seasoned wok produces.  The veggies are always fresh, meats are perfectly cooked and coated with layers of flavor. 
That's it!  It has layers of flavors that makes this place a one of a kind place.  I highly recommend this place and well worth a drive from anywhere in the state, No B.S.!"}
{"text":"Yelp steered us right again. This is a wonderful little place with authentic but unique tasting Asian food. We had chili sauce dumplings, chicken low mien, and Mogollon chicken. We loved reading it all."}
{"text":"A year ago I posted a nasty review of this place. The general consensus for my friends and I was that it was a place with amazing food and horrible service. But things have surely changed. Asian cafe has provided outstanding service and hasn't changed their dining at all. This place deserves 5 stars. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. 
EAT AT A.C.E.!"}
{"text":"Mmm ACE, you are aces! You know a restaurant is good when you crave them MONTHS after visiting them. I had the chance to spend a wonderful day with my Foodie Bear and a friend. I don't normally venture into Mesa, but he convinced me to go to dinner with them at ACE. I'm SO glad I decided to go! 
When you first walk in, you'll notice the place isn't much to look at. As most of you foodies know, never judge a book by its' cover! We were warmly greeted and we sat down to review the HUGE menu. They offer your run of the mill Pan Asian cuisine but then they offer various authentic dishes that will make you melt! 
Since I had never been there before, and I will eat pretty much anything that doesn't eat me first, I allowed Foodie Bear to order the food! When the waitress came to the table he immediately ordered the baked pork chop. I don't know if she even got out her greeting. The Bear knows what the Bear wants! Apparently this dish takes a while to cook. We also picked the Peking pork ribs, I believe some orange chicken, and an order of fried rice. As an appetizer, I tried a spring roll. 
I could see the boyish glee on FB's face while we waited a short time for our food to arrive so I knew I was in for a treat! The food started to arrive and we dug in. Oh my goodness the flavors! The baked pork chop was amazing. It really reminded me more of a simple Italian dish than an Asian one. The parallels between the two countries' cuisines were really highlighted in this dish. A nice tomato based sauce, tender pork chop over a bed of white rice. It was very well made! My favorite were the Peking short ribs. They had a semisweet glaze over a lightly battered, tendered piece of meat. Careful of the bones! Their fried rice was nice and smoky flavored, a sign of a seasoned wok. I didn't try the orange chicken as I was full to the top, but it smelled great! 
I frequently think of my visit to ACE. I can't wait to return to try another one of their many dishes. I can't wait to find another craving!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant in the valley, no question. I've been here at least 10 times, and the quality of the food is flawless every time. I usually order either the Curry Chicken Fillet over Rice or the Pork and Vegetable Soup. Service is also quick and the people are friendly. The prices are very low, so the value is incredible."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was the person who took me to this place because he dubbed it as the best hole in the wall for chinese food. lol

This is one of the places that he loves to go to where the food is really good 

***

Now I have been here a few times and I want to be honest to those who are seeking a really good place to eat good chinese food.

Don't expect to imagine this place as a fancy restaurant or any place that is spic and span with cleanliness on top - because it's NOT that type of place. However, it is a hole in the wall place where you can enjoy your food and look beyond the appearance of this tiny eatery.

Looks can be deceiving so think of that before you decide to eat here.

The wait time to be seated is always going to take more than 20minutes because this place is popular it will always be BUSY and when I mean busy I mean you walk through that door and people will stare at you for a bit then resume eating. There will be tables that are not cleaned and few of the workers there will be sparse due to trying to maintain and do their job

There will be a long or short line consisting of  people eating for two to a party of 4-6 standing in line to eat OR doing a take out.  If you can not be patient and wait, then I recommend you go eat somewhere else.

The same applies if you are ordering there for a to go. If you are calling to place an order to go - good luck because the workers do not speak clear english just to warn you again.

If you are seated, you will need to have patience to wait for more than 15 minutes until someone can come over to take your order. If you feel offended that most of the customers are chinese and are served first before you - don't take it to heart. That is just the way of things and again you are here to enjoy yourself and the food.

If you have kids, I would go look elsewhere because the wait will be long and majority of kids will start to fidget and want food due to being very hungry. If you are patient and if your kids are patient enough then it is worth eating there.

These are all the factors that I have noticed when I come here with my boyfriend. There is nothing that can be done about it except for being patient and waiting for the food to arrive. For me, it is worth eating there unless we decided to do a take out and relax at home with our food.

Again, I express if you really want to eat here you must have an understanding and be patient :)

I do suggest this place if you meet what I wrote above because the food is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Awesome hole in a wall place with cheap food. Their az bowls are only 3.98 and its a good portion. Love their broccoli beef. My one complaint tho is when this place is busy, the waitresses and waiters tend to freak out a little and forget people sometimes. I've seen people leave Bc they were forgotten. But when it's not busy, great service and cheap chinese food. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Great food, and very popular! Trouble finding a seat. Loved the beef Lo mein, and general chicken."}
{"text":"We had the fish fillet over rice. The food came out hot and tasty. There was bok choy on it. The fish was tender and not dried out or firm.

We also had the kung pao shrimp which was tasty.  The kung pao shrimp was a bit spicy, which I liked, and a little bit sweet at the same time. The menu is huge and a bit intimidating but the prices are super cheap."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!.. Not once was my water refilled or were we ask if everything was ok. It took them 30min to even service us.. Never will I come again!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Ny recently, and was concerned with not being able to find a good Chinese spot. Well this was the first place i tried, and man was I lucky! The food was exceptional, my favorite was their spicy dumplings, filled with  flavor! Prices were good, and friendly when I went inside to pick it up. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I'm not sure why, but it's been exceedingly difficult for me to find a good Chinese restaurant in AZ.  I guess I'm really spoiled with NY spots.  I used to have a place that knew exactly how to fry the tofu and substituted tofu for any dish that was made with meat.  The portions were large and came out to $5.75.  I find AZ Chinese Restaurants either don't cater to vegetarians at all, are too \"shi-shi\" or don't have good lunch specials.   And they never put broccoli in the dishes, what's up with that????

Now, out of all the places I've gone to this one came the closest to giving me the flavor I needed.  If you're a vegetarian, they can modify many dishes to suit your needs.  The hostess was very helpful!  Because of this, I am encouraged to go back and try more things.  No lunch specials for veggies tho.  I ordered a large size of Kung Pao Tofu with brown rice.  Yay for brown rice!  This is the FIRST place out here I've found that has it!!  The Kung Pao was a bit spicy for me, but that's how it's supposed to be.  I ordered it because it was the closest thing I could get to General Tso.  Their portions are large and the service was great."}
{"text":"Ok, my turn!!!  Review number 262.

I ate here tonight with a friend and we had a great meal!  just like all the other reviews said, friendly, relaxed atmosphere and really awesome food.

This is the real deal.  If you have had great Chinese food in New York City or another similar city with a large Chinese community then you know good food comes with a certain atmosphere.  I immediately felt right at home and after looking through the enormous catalog of a menu, chose a fantastic meal.  I took the left overs home for lunch tomorrow but they only lasted about two hours in the fridge before I had to just finish them off.  

Great prices, good environment and fantastic food.  Yeah!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and food was so delicious !!  Beat I've had in Arizona !   Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous   Def coming back"}
{"text":"My favorite non-special occasion Chinese place. It's good, cheap, and authentic. The authentic part is surprisingly hard to find in the valley. The menu is huge, but you can't go wrong with the real stuff on the last few pages or the options on the wall. Some favorites: tofu with vermicelli, the noodle soups, singapore hainan chicken rice, fat noodles with spareribs in black bean sauce."}
{"text":"A few months ago I would have given Ace a 6 star review without a doubt!  I bumped it down due to multiple bad visits were the food was cold and/or soggy(ordering what I have always ordered: Orange Chicken special bowl and egg rolls).  With that said, I have always loved this place from the first bite!  While its interior is a bit dated, the food is fantastic and well priced.  Its so good that my positive visits out weigh the negative visits.  I could be wrong but I believe they were training a new chef at that time.  I would greatly recommend that people come and try some authentic Chinese food. (coming from someone that has visited china)"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in town. I lived in China and I can truthfully say this is the real deal. Authentic, fresh, and flavorful, and just as a bonus, INSANELY cheap. I eat there all the time and I am STILL in awe every time I get the bill.

The staff is also so wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating. The ambience is extremely lacking, which adds to the charm, in my opinion. Total hole-in-the-wall, diamond in the rough. Doesn't get much better than Asian Cafe Express."}
{"text":"Excellent food! If you can visit, you will not be disappointed. It can be annoying though that it is very crowded at times. Recommend take out."}
{"text":"My friends and I visit frequently because of the great food, value, and service.  I moved out of the area but always make a visit when I am in the area.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place for you to get Hong Kong style food in Phoenix. Prices are very reasonable, food is delicious. 

Being born and raised in Hong Kong, every time I go to Asian Cafe Express makes me feel like I am eating at a good restaurant in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"When I see a shady strip mall and outdated decor, that's usually a good sign. The menu is extensive, the food is good and greatly affordable."}
{"text":"The best, authentic Chinese food I have found in Mesa.  Good food, affordable, and large servings.  It's what I'm looking for..."}
{"text":"This is not your average Chinese restaurant.  First of all, if you are looking for a quiet, pretty-little-date-night kind of place, don't go here.  This is as authentic as you can get without all the frills of ambience.  EXCELLENT food!!!!   The wait time usually takes awhile, especially if you go for a late dinner (after 7pm).  It gets so busy that the waitresses are running and don't have enough time to bus their own tables. So often you will find lots of dishes piled up on one table or you have to sit and wait for the table to be bussed.  BUT, if you can live with all of that, you will find THE BEST CHINESE food that is WORTH THE WAIT, and WORTH THE CHAOS.   The menu goes on forever.... With so much to choose from, you will be happy for the wait - just so you can get through the menu!  One more thing - if you catch your own fish, or buy it from the Asian Market across the street, bring it in and they will cook it for you!!  I highly recommend the Salt and Pepper Squid (or S&P Chicken too) as an appetizer.  It's pretty salty but OH SO GOOD!!  So many good things to try here!!"}
{"text":"Affordable, quick and sooooo good. The waitor was even nice enough to explain the type of soup I was ordering and asked if I was trying to go with something more meaty. If so, he recommended a different bowl. Thank god he did because I almost order something I didn't want! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"This review is purely for the Hong Kong style food at ACE - and really, that's all you should be coming here for anyway. The food is super authentic, everything tastes just like my mom's food (perhaps a tad saltier on some trips), and the value is insane. I've come with as many as 8 people and spent less than $100 total for dinner + a ton of leftovers. Usually we'll get one of the family meal variations and add on a few other dishes depending on the size of the party and/or what everybody feels like eating. A must-have dish that we always order is the salt and pepper squid, fried perfectly on the outside and soft on the inside with a little kick to it - I'm not ashamed to say that I usually scoop up all the little fried bits that are leftover and eat  it with rice.

Staff is always super friendly here and ordering is easy, even in English. Service can be a tad slow at times because there's usually only one or two servers working the whole restaurant, although the food comes out very quick once your order is in.

I was a little worried they had changed the menu based on another review here, but I'm happy to report that isn't the case as of June 2018."}
{"text":"This place is great food is amazing and the waitresses try so hard to pick up the pace when it gets busy. If you come in before 7pm it's the best time because it's not super busy, food doesn't take long but unfortunately the service does. But it is not the servers fault it is because they're short staffed and the place gets so packed that there is a line at night. I give food and service 5 stars but I give 4 stars to management. You guys should really hire more people to help out at night instead of having two people take care of a packed restaurant, poor girls are even checking people out and are running around like crazu. I come here all the time before 7  pm and it's amazing, highly recommend the beef lo main!"}
{"text":"I so miss Asian Cafe Express. I didnt realize how much i would miss it since moving away over a year ago. I would dine here once a week some times more. The food at Asian Cafe Express is delicious, portions are very good and prices are great. Looking at their menu i see they raised their prices a little. And its still a great bargin. 

For drinks i usually ordered taro coconut w/ tapioca. 
For my meal i would generally get bok choy with black mushrooms or double mushroom with bok choy or with mixed vegetables. And the use whole black mushrooms not sliced black mushrooms or tiny pieces,whole ones. I make this point because ive been to some restaurants in my new city and i havent found one chinese restaurant that offers black mushrooms and if the do they slice them up into halfs or small pieces. 
I would also some times order ginger green onion w/fish fillet, chinese broccoli.w/fish fillet. Or just and order of bok choy or chinese broccoli. They never over cooked the vegetables and the vegetables were always in abundance. Yum!  Reguardless what you order at Asian Cafe Express if it includes vegetables you can rest assured they will not be cheap or mizerly with the veggies the will give you a generous amount of veggies (not over cooked). It wont be just some tiny broccoli florets and carrots. And the vegetables will be mixed in throughout your whole plate. 

The atmosphere at ACE is relaxed its not at all pretentcious or posh. Simple, clean and not worried about designer tables or posh art on the walls. Working class, builders, laborers, any office workers. Comfortable for all. Great place for very good food. 

Im still searching but so far i havent found any thing as good as Asian Cafe Express in my new home."}
{"text":"Prices are really cheap and portions and generous.  It seems to always be busy which is a good sign.  Service can be a bit slow and it's not a date night type of place but there selection is large and there chinese menu of dishes are hard to find in the Phoenix area.  I would give this place 4 stars except for the fact that what ever oil they use for what seems like all of their dishes has a strange aftertaste to it that I can't place.  It's not present in the dishes when I order them in Chinatowns in San Fran, New York, Philly."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for Asian food. It can get pretty busy at dinner time so beware if the service is a little slow at that time. The majority of the time though, the food is served quickly and hot! So far, I have never been disappointed by the quality. It's good stuff!"}
{"text":"Just got back from eating at Asian Cafe Express.  I went there strictly based on Yelp reviews.  Here is my assessment:
Portions=5 stars
Pricing=5 stars
Service/friendliness=4 stars
Food taste= 2
Based on the above, they deserve 4 stars all things being equal. But things are NOT equal.  The taste of the food is what should drive the rating of a restaurant assuming that they don't throw the food at you or spit in your soup.  Other than that , it is taste, taste ,taste.  
I was not impressed with the taste of the food.  I have been to NYC Chinatown restaurants, San Francisco's Chinatown, LA's Chinatown, even Paris' Chinatown so I know what good chinese food is.  This is not it.  
People's judgement gets clouded by a low price and then suddenly everything tastes great.  You will note that most of the reviews make reference to their low prices and maybe that's why that have all those Best of Phoenix ratings.  People rate restaurants not only on taste but overwhelmingly based upon getting a good bang for the dollar.  This is a case where the bang for the buck reigned supreme.  AND...
by the way, they said their toilets were not working.  Isn't it illegal to operate a restaurant without have toilets working properly considering that the restaurant has a capacity of at least 90 people?  Where does the staff go pi-pi?  Just asking.... 
Anyway,  Food is rated a two and this geeser isn't spending gas to save a few nickels on food.  I would rather pay more for half the portion and feel that I have had a DELICIOUS and DELECTABLE meal.  My husband on the other hand................"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best egg drop soup I have tried around here. I have been ro several places, but nothing better than their soup. :)"}
{"text":"This place is solid! You want some reasonably priced Chinese food, check this place out. My friend and I have gone here twice and both times they did their job and filled us up. The portion sizes are good and like I said earlier their prices are good too. 

When you walk in, they have a bunch of their menu items pictured on both walls. So you can get an idea of what you are planning to eat. 

Service is quick, there are two servers and the get your order and bring out the food right away. 

They have a sign that says you can bring your own fish in and they'll cook it. I don't see myself doing that any time soon, but I'm sure my parents would. 

All I can say is the food is very flavorful. We order family style each time we go here and everything tastes great. I love sharing differnt foods. It gives you the opportunity to try differnt foods."}
{"text":"I had the dumplings and house special noodles, very flavorful and filling. The place was busy but had quick service. The crowd was notably diverse: Chinese couples going to ASU, Russians, Latinos, Anglos and African Americans, all in for good cheap food."}
{"text":"Food was good but I'm giving it four stars since it was such a bargain to eat there. A family dinner special that could feed 6 people was only $22. It was just me and my wife and we barely dented it as there was a ton of food.

Had the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Fried Rice and Lo Mein with Hong Kong Coffee and Milk Tea to drink. Everything was very tasty but I would say the sweet and sour chicken was the weakest dish as the sauce was warm and made the breaded fried chicken a bit mushy.

We ordered from the Arizona style menu (Americanized Chinese food) but they have an authentic Hong Kong style menu with all the things I seen in the cafe's in Hong Kong and China while visiting there. Very authentic feeling place and 95% of the customers were asian.

Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Great cheap homemade Chinese comfort food ... Very easy to get to and the owners there are very nice to everyone.  They talk with you see how your days are and make sure everything is good in your life.  Overall service was excellent, it's right off the light-rail stop too in Mesa!"}
{"text":"You never go to Chinese Restaurants because they have become too Americanized, and you want some Real Chinese food?  

This is the place, not fancy, but clean friendly and the food is just perfect.

The menu is huge make sure you get the whole thing!  Not just the sweet and sour American version.

My wife, son and I have been here a few times and each time discover new items on the menu.  Each time the waitress has asked us some sort of question.... like \"are you sure you know that there is no meat, just tofu? \" or, \"are you sure that you want the whole fish, it has bones in it?\"  I am sure they have their fair share of people who will get something and say..\"ewww, the fish has eyes....\"  Anyway, back to the food and how great it tastes!  Perfect for those who are looking for something Real

Forget about the exterior, the seating or the lack of decor, if you want that go to PF Changs,but if you want really good authentic Chinese food with TONS and TONS of options that you will never find the time to finish then this is the place."}
{"text":"I dined here for dinner on a busy Friday night recently and was very disappointed.  The usual fresh spareribs in black bean sauce was not so fresh, their beef and bitter melon was so greasy, that you could see a shiny layer of oil floating on top.  I enter Chinese restaurants with the understanding that I will be indulging happily in high calorie meal but when your dish displays a separated layer of oil, it makes you lose your enthusiasm. For the third dish, the steamed chicken was tasty, accompanied with the wonderfully pungent garlic/ginger side.  I hope to write a better review next time...............I'll pack some Rolaid's.  ;)"}
{"text":"Some damn good Chinese food!!!!the house special line in and rice are very very good and the Kung pow sauce is incredible"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't written a review for this place yet. Literally the best place to get Chinese food in Tempe. Cheap price, great taste, and that's it!

Yes, I didn't mention the service. It's a bit subpar and you tend to get ignored on busier days. Heck, we even refilled our water ourselves on multiple occasions.

But I still give this place 5 stars because the food is THAT GOOD! Great for college students, you can get five huge entrees for 32 bucks with rice, fried rice, and noodles! That's twice the size you would get for a Panda Express meal per person!

My favorites by far are the salt and pepper squid and the Peking style spare ribs but almost everything here is amazing. Also this place sucks for groups bigger than eight."}
{"text":"Always busy, but very short staffed.  Well worth the wait, however! Chow mein is a must have. Order salt and pepper squid. Never ending menu, something for everyone. And note how many Asians dine here, you know it's good Asian food when the Asians come here. You could also visit MeKong market, grab your meat and veggies and they will cook it to your liking"}
{"text":"The best in the valley!!! Great prices, plenty of food, and an awesome staff! Authentic - Check. Great Flavor - Check. Good Pricing - Check. Staff That Actually Cares - Check. You won't find any better."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious! Very authentic! The portions and price are great! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service for a great price. Decor leaves a bit to be desired, but that has never been a problem for me. I'm a frequent customer and always leave happy and rather full. I'm a big fan of the lunch specials--for about 6 bucks you get rice and your choice of a bunch of different entrees. All of them are worth a try! I also like the Sichuan set dinner. It's an extremely delicious set of dishes for a big group and honestly one of the most delicious flavor combinations I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the combination fried rice it was maybe the second best I've had at a Chinese restaurant first being China China which burned then closed. My wife had chicken lo mein, flavor was good wasn't dry either like some other places. Also ordered some orange chicken which was above average. 

The reason why it's only 4/5 is we decided to eat at the restaurant, service was courteous but slow. Seating arrangements are pretty cramped. Next time I eat here it'll definitely be takeout."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took us so long to hear about this place. Our lunch today was some of the best Chinese food we have had in a long time. The orange chicken and spicy chicken dumplings were superb!!! I shouldn't say this, but they need to raise their prices. This is probably the best deal in town as far as authentic Chinese food goes. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall spot!

So!, before going to the movies we decided to grab some food. This place is located in a small plaza.

Restaurant itself is pretty packed. Food it is awesome. They have a HUGE MENU. With so many good prices and combos for big eaters or families.

I had the sweet and sour pork ribs (delicious), vegetables with a korean sauce and fried rice with beef and shrimp...blew my mind. And the portions were huge, lot of left overs :)

Be ready to wait 10-15 min to be seated (not all the time), goes quick. 

Definitely a must go spot!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's really hard to find a good Chinese place since I've been back from China. This is Hong Kong food, so it's not exactly the same, but Cantonese is pretty much what you're stuck with in America, and this place is really good for what it is. The food has good flavor and there are a lot of Canton people there all the time, so you know it's really authentic. Rice plates are the best value for your money. I really want to try the Regional meals, where it's one price for multiple dishes (family size meal) based on whatever area in China you choose."}
{"text":"The Best. Friendly staff, delicious food I will say it's one of the top in AZ.  Never any issues. Consist A on health inspection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good and very cheap too. Right off the Metro stop,on border of Tempe/Mesa. Always busy. Lots of authentic dishes if you dare, but also the standard stuff too. There is no atmosphere at all so don't expect much, it's def a dive. The Kung Pao Chicken sometimes changes, according to who's cooking that night. Lo mein is excellent."}
{"text":"This gem is our go-to restaurant foe take-out and occasional dine-in (very outdated and worn), They're food is amazing and NeVeR disappoints, The staff is great and always remembers our favorite items when we order. I highly recommend - definitely get the ginger sauce ... I'm addicted and it makes everything go from outstanding to amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just saw a African American person walk in while I was eating and the waitresses and cashier was rude to them. The Asian waitress kept bumping into them without saying \"excuse me\" for NO REASON while they waited for someone to help them :-( After waiting for someone to acknowledge them (and no one did), they gave up and left.  I believe in diversity and humanity and because that person was not Caucasian or Asian; or even Asian like the family/people who work here, they didn't help them and was very rude to them for reason. This a family oriented place and this is a poor example to display to kids and other guests. I mean it's 2016 but some people are stuck in ignorance...This ruined my meal because the person did nothing and should have been treated like any other customer. At the end of the day their money is GREEN too. This will be my last meal with my family and friends here today."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place I've been to in Phoenix, especially if you order off the back pages of the menu.  Trust me, order off the back pages.

The salt and pepper squid is great... try the Hong Kong style chow mein with pan fried noodles, it's very well done.  These guys are masters with eggplant.

I see people buy things at Mekong (meats, seafood) and bring them in with them and the place here will cook it up.  Very cool.

You can't beat the prices, either.  I usually go here with a friend or two, and 30 bucks gets us enough food to all take home leftovers and have a second meal.

It's a place that would rival some of my favorite Chinese dives in LA and San Francisco (and that is a big compliment in my mind).  Great place and I'm glad to see that so many others appreciate it too."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review just after I trashed Miu's Cuisine down the street, because a couple days ago I walked out of Miu's in disgust and drove up to Asian Cafe Express and had the lunch I was hoping for.  Asian Cafe Express is everything Miu's isn't.  Consistently excellent food, terrific, friendly service (Don't you just love it when the server remembers what you ordered the last time you were there?), served quickly, and you'll never think you've paid too much.  They deserve their excellent reputation."}
{"text":"I am only in central PHX for 2 years, I am used to great Chinese food in NYC where I came from. I found a great take out in north Scottsdale which I also rate 5 stars, Red House. This place is a nice size restaurant, mostly Asian clientele, and you could tell they are satisfied regulars. I was referred here, came with 3 friends, and we were so impressed. The menu is so huge with food from many regions and Hong Kong. There was so much I wanted to try, I will be back regularly to do so. We had noodle dishes, egg rolls, soups, dumplings, Chicken and pork dishes, we ate enough for 3 meals. Everything was so great. The waitress spoke English but with a little difficulty. She was so cheerful, friendly, pleasant and came back when she could despite the huge crowd at 8 PM.

It was the best 20 minute trip I took since moving here."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is consistently amazing. The staff is very friendly as well. We called in an order for The General's Chicken, house noodles and rice. They had it ready to go within 10 mins of us waiting. Oh,  and it's very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We walked in the restaurant on a Sunday night and it was packed, which is always a good sign! It was a bit awkward when we first arrive because we did not know if we were suppose to sit ourselves or wait. Eventually, they waved us to sit down. The menu is huge! There is so much food you can select! Taiwanese and Chinese. Not to mention, it is extremely inexpensive! Customer service was great as well! We got a wonton noodle soup, black  pepper chicken, and a iced milk tea. All was good! About $5-7 an entree. We will be back!!! :)"}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie. This place serves legit Chinese food at a bargain price. Since it is a hike from our home and we didn't know when/if we would be back, we tried a bunch of food (and will have leftovers for a million days). The menu was huge and somewhat strangely disorganized. Make sure to look all the way through so you don't miss out on the yummies in the back. We ordered:

Kung Pao Chicken/fried rice
General Tso's chicken/brown rice
Veggie Chow Fun (dry)
Crab puff ($2 for 2 large poofs)
Spicy chili chicken dumplings(4)
2 sodas

(all for $28!!)

The Kung Pao was tasty, spicy and the veggies cooked perfectly. The chicken was a good quality. The only negative was that the peanuts were placed on top after the dish was prepared. The general's chicken sauce had a kick and the crunch and taste of the breading was unique and yummy. The chicken meat wasn't all the greatest quality (a lot of dark meat, untrimmed gristle) but served its purpose. Bummer that no peppers or veggies come with General's as elsewhere.

I was offered either wet or dry chow fun and went with the recommended dry (stir fried in soy sauce). So glad that I got the veggie version. Perfectly cooked and the subtle sauce on the flat rice noodles was fabulous. The crab puffs(2) were clearly homemade, which we appreciated but they didn't have much flavor. No crab to be found and missing that slight sweetness that I enjoy in the puff elsewhere. Hubby enjoyed the dumplings (4) and saved the sauce for his dish (I didn't care for the sauce but the dumpling was cooked really well). They give you cans of soda (thus, no refills) and the food comes out super fast. This is usually appreciated but it came out at the same time as our appetizers, which didn't give us a chance to ease into our ginormous meal. 

Due to the freshness and low cost of the food as well as wide variety of options, we would come back but try something different."}
{"text":"The food is the best I have tasted in this area. This is not your regular chow mein or chop suey. etc. The food is fresh, extremely favorable and as spicy as you want. The price is reasonable and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Hundreds of items to choose from, literally, their menu was a like an old phone book. Good food and good service, authentic Chinese, will definitely go back if in the area"}
{"text":"Huge amazing menu.  It's literally the size of a phone book.  The food is excellent and the the prices are very reasonable considering.

The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is it's almost always a very crowded place (for good reason!) and the chairs could be more comfortable and the tables could be a bit classier.  It's a bit claustrophobic when it's extremely busy.

Excellent place otherwise.

Ask for the Beef Chow Fun with gravy :)"}
{"text":"Why oh why is Asian Express not closer to me? I would eat here so much more.. with it's incredibly affordable, vast options, and authentic deliciousness. I had the combo chow fun, and it's very rare that anybody gets it right (as far as I have tried previously anyways), and it was spot on. Sauce proportion was perfect ratio with amount of noodles and meat. Noodles had the right amount of stickiness and not stuck in annoying chunks.

The second time I came here, I ordered the combo fried rice with hot and sour soup. I wasn't really feeling the soup since it tasted overly sour and Americanized, but the fried rice was perfect, I love the amount of oil used so that each grain is separated and not bunched up and mushy like a lot of other places. 

It was quite embarrassing how I (gulp) left my wallet in the car like an idiot though. I apologized profusely and said I would leave all my personal belongings (including my purse and iPhone) with them if they would allow me to quickly grab my wallet, that was sitting in my car 10 feet away from the store front. They had no problems with it, and even insisted that I don't need to leave my belongings with them.. how trusting of them. As I came back and paid for my food, they told me not to worry about it. 

Not only does this place deserve 5 stars for their food, but 5 stars for just being great people."}
{"text":"One of the worst chinese restaurants I've ever been to. I understand that the dish that I order isn't something that is usually on the menu at chinese restaurants but they should still know how to make it, everyone else has up until now. I asked them if they could make general tsos tofu and the lady at the register said yes. I was given a tray with tofu and general tsos sauce and white rice on the side. The dish didn't come with onions, broccoli or anything. It was just tofu, the sauce and rice. I asked for the sauce to be spicy and it wasn't and it didn't even have much of a taste to it and to make matters even worst I'm pretty sure there was little tiny pieces of chicken mixed in with the tofu. It had a different texture and taste from the tofu. I'm a vegetarian, I can't be eating chicken!! It was 10 bucks for one of the worst dishes I've ever had. The tofu was way too soft. I asked for fried tofu! Every other chinese spot makes the general tsos tofu crispy not super soft like this place did it. Horrible chinese food here. I'm from New York City and I know good chinese, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Interesting. I have been wanting to try this place out for quite awhile. It is located in a older shopping center that is missing the main grocery store. Easy to drive right past. Inside is a no frills situation but casual. There are colorful pictures on the wall of some of the exotic dishes to point at when ordering which I did. In addition there are more specials written in Chinese hanging on the walls.

Giant selection of food to choose from with both American and Hong Kong style menus. I was mainly interested in the selections that I have seen in Chinese cookbooks that I own that are not written in English or poorly translated. I have been here a few times now for lunch.

Started off with some Spicy Dumplings and then tried the Szechuan Spicy Water Boil Fish which was really tasty. They make their own hot sauce and have it in a jar on the table for extra heat. Also tried the XO Sauce Beef stir fry once with Chili Salt chicken wings on the side which was good. Today the Black Mushroom, Fish Fillet and Tofu Hot Pot with a couple of egg rolls on the side. I think I'm hooked on Hot Pots. Giant portions of food for a reasonable price.

Check out their web site for the dish of the week.You can actually bring your own seafood and they will cook it for you. Nice!

Service is friendly and quick although I get there when they open. Place can get a little dirty at times in certain areas. Just need a little touch up once in a while. Good thing the Wok is really hot. See you there next time. CHOP CHOP!

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This place is OG, very authentic. The food here is very close to my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Fran. Don't come expecting anything fancy. ACE is very humble and casual which is what I prefer. The massive menu was a red flag but everything we tried there is great. We have been there 3 times but we ended up ordering the same 3 items every time because it was so good. I'm still not sure how they provide such great food with such large portions at such a low price point. Luckily, we need to drive a good 30min to get to ACE. If they were closer I would be 400lbs"}
{"text":"This place is really great. The menu is extensive so it takes some time to get through your first visit. The selection is wonderful. The prices are amazing for the amount of food you get. I love their potstickers! The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars is because their service can be really slow. They usually only have 2 girls working a completely packed dining room. All in all, a great place!"}
{"text":"umm....no...this place is definitely not for us....

I've read all the positive reviews and was totally excited to try this place today.  We've been craving really good Chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from Cali.  \"Inexpensive, great food, nice service\"...sounded nice...

First of all, yes the service is really nice.  They were very relaxed and ready to serve you.  The order took around 15min for a take out which is pretty fast.  

Second, the price....yes it is on the cheap side but is it really that inexpensive?  For example, compared to Phoenix Palace, most typical menu items are maybe ~$2.00 or so cheaper...but if you ask me, you are compromising the quality of the food for that few dollars you are saving.

Third, the food....OILY....really...OILY.  
*Chili salt chicken wings = 5 pieces for $2.99.  Good price, dry, bland, not worth it.
*Orange chicken = burnt, drowning in dark sauce, couldn't tell where the meat was...
*XO sauce beef =....we found....6 pieces of beef slices and the rest was corn starch and onion mush...with orange colored oil all over.
*Bean sauce chow fun with squid = this was the only ok dish.  Tons of squid which was cool, but not much chow fun at all...and again, oily.

Overall, we didn't like it.  
Are we gonna go back = NO
Maybe try again someday? = NO

*Location = good, right across the street from Mekong Plaza
*Food = the extra $2.00 is so worth it at other restaurants.
*Service = very nice
*Decor = very plain"}
{"text":"An excellent example of amazing food with even better prices!! Serving sizes are large and taste is even better!! If you want a more home cooked food in this style this is definitely the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Might be some of the best Chinese food I've ever had in my life. the menu makes you want to explore new dishes everything looks fantastic and the food is amazing. the beef and broccoli are out of this world"}
{"text":"I'd now like to give ACE  *six* stars!  I've only recently become aware of the harmfulness of MSG, and they don't use it here, in fact they told me they really hate the stuff because it is bad for you."}
{"text":"Ordered fish fillet chow mien, salt and pepper pork chop and tofu hot pot. It's not Chinatown quality but it's \"good enough\" to quench the Chinese food longing."}
{"text":"This place! So delicious! I don't make it here as often as I would like but we went last night (7/26). It wasn't too crowded like it usually is so that was nice. Servers were really friendly this time too. We ordered hot and spicy soup, egg rolls, spring rolls, black pepper chicken and Kung Pao chicken. All if it hot, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"So I've come back several times to try more of the menu. I would say to stick to the Hong Kong style dishes and away from the other regional cuisines.  They're not done badly, just not as well."}
{"text":"We've been here several times for lunch/dinner and IT IS AWESOME. Absolutely our favorite place for a quick cheap meal. They are always so sweet to my daughter and they bring out our food fast. I highly recommend their pork fried rice, we ordered it last time we went and it was better than any fried rice I've ever had. Not too greasy and not overly salty, it was flavorful and for $5 we got enough for all three of us and took leftovers home. We never spend more than $15 or so and always have enough for another meal at home. We love it so much that we'll be taking my parents here when they come visit so they can see how awesome it is too :)"}
{"text":"i love it
this place is a gift from the heavens and i will  die with a full meal from asain cafe express in my belly"}
{"text":"My friends  love this place . The restaurant  looks like a dive . They were short handed  only two waitress.  The food  portions  were large.  The priced were reasonable.  Had their  wanton noodles  which was decent . The broth could use some more flavor.. we had twice cooked pork and ended up with sweet and sour pork. It was actually  pretty good. We did like their  schezuan shrimp.  Service was slow. Forgot to bring our bill . Did not fill our water. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"very good cheap asian food. i can eat like a queen here and the bill is never over $20 bucks. and i order a lot of shit! i really like that they have a large amount of tables. i am never stuck waiting for a table. the food comes out quite fast especially on down hours. they have great milk tea and i really like that you have the option of ordering it hot. on top of that i like that the milk tea is not sweet and you can sweeten it yourself so it is to your liking! all the dishes ive ever ordered here came out delicious. the portions are decent too. i wish i lived closer to this restaurant. their style reminds me of home cooking my grandma used to make. they are pretty fluent in english as well as both dialects of chinese. i really appreciate foreign restaurants with workers who know english. shows that they care enough about the business to cater to the general america!"}
{"text":"I been going to this place for years now.  Its the same lady we see when my friends and I come.  (she sometimes ask how my mom is doing, but I didn't know she knew my mom until recently1!)  Anyways, the food is just like how my mom used to make it when I was a kid.  Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Went here with friend and fellow yelper John M. for Sunday lunch, to try their dish of the week which is announced and updated weekly in their facebook page. This week it's a crispy chicken dish with country style sauce. It turned out to be one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had - really juicy and tender, with crispy skin and covered with a savory spicy sauce. This was one of two dishes we ordered and came a bit later than the other one probably because of extra time needed to crisp up the skin in frying, but it was worth the slight additional wait. This place never ceases to amaze and delight me."}
{"text":"I am originally from the Bay Area and have been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant for quite some time. I stumbled upon this place after grocery shopping around the area. After cooking almost the same things for myself for a good three months I decided I needed a change of flavors. The service was fast and attentive as I was seated immediately on a Sunday during lunch hour. I ordered the Chinese Beef Stew Noodle Soup. The herbal taste of the soup was overwhelming in the beginning, but my taste buds must have gotten used to it after a few sips... so I guess it was okay? The meat and noodle was good. Overall, the noodle soup was decent and until I find a better spot this will place will suffice if I am having any Chinese food cravings."}
{"text":"Legit Americanized Chinese + authentic Hong Kong cusine - basically a China Town restaurant in the middle of Mesa."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the price and the quality of the food, for a good 20 square mile area. Their service is pretty average, and their ambiance below average (like any authentic Chinese place...) Unfortunately, if a \"good\" Chinese place actually had nice interiors, I'd dock OFF a star for the lack of authenticity, haha...

I came here the first time for their porridge/congee, since not too many Chinese places offer the dish, and it's one of my faves. Pretty much everything I've ever gotten here was really tasty, and we've been back a good number of times.  I always recommend this as a great local eatery."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Asia Cafe Express a very delightful experience.  The staff was very courteous and very helpful.  The four of us enjoyed the Family style.  An added bonus was a couple of \"regulars\" who helped us feel comfortable with selecting our dishes.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better finds that I have found near Mekong Plaza. The prices are very reasonable for what is offered and the portions are of decent size. I had some items from the AZ menu like the Chicken Broccoli & Fish Fillet and got to try the Mapo Tofu from the regular HK menu. The service could be improved however as it does take a while to sit down and order some food. Other than that though the food does come out quickly. There was an instance where after ordering some take-out from them I was waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, they realized that the ticket was left on the floor. It didn't bother me much since they seemed very busy that night and also I wasn't in much of a rush. At least they were very apologetic about the situation and offered me to grab a drink from the fridge free of charge.

I thought their Mapo Tofu was very good and the portions were larger than expected. The Chicken Broccoli was not too bad and I thought it was decent compared to some other places that I have been to. Fish Fillet could have been better but it was still satisfactory. Overall I would definitely make my way back there considering how great the prices are for everything."}
{"text":"Had beef chow fun was adequate not sure of the rest of the food got it to go the restaurant is shoddy and not real clean probably no return visit"}
{"text":"Affordable, authentic and large portions! Perfect place for take-out. It seems to always be a full house here.

Menu is a little overwhelming but there are pictures of entrees all around the restaurant for reference."}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express gets five stars because it is the ONLY take out Asian food I ever get.  I've tried other places, and nothing compares, so when you find something this awesome and affordable with the best twice cooked pork in the world, you don't stray. 

I keep an Asian Cafe Express menu in my kitchen drawer and I mark each thing I've tried with a smiley face, a sad face, or one of those faces that just have a line for a mouth (those ones represent \"okay\").  May I note though, that nothing is bad, it's all about personal preference, the stuff that got a sad face was never because it was bad, it was just because it wasn't really my bag.

The twice cooked pork is arguably the best thing in the world.  I would put this twice cooked pork up against five star restaurants, that asshole with those cooking shows on Fox, or maybe even some Eastern religion's God.  I get it every time I go there and when I leave this city I will travel great distances to have it again. 

Also worth traveling for is the General Chicken w/ Sweet and Chili Sauce, this has just the right about of sweet and spice with nice, well cooked, perfectly prepared chicken stuffed in one of those awesome Asian take out food boxes.  In fact, all of the chicken dishes are pretty good, that goes for the fried rice too, ESPECIALLY the pork fried rice which I would shower in if I could. 

I've tried most of the appetizers as well and my favorites are the Chili Sauce Dumplings and the spring rolls.  There's nothing fancy about them, they're just always the perfect companion to your meal.  The only complaint I ever had was with the Chili Salt Chicken Wings which, while still better than a lot of gross shit I've had, were SOOO salty I could hardly eat them. 

Also notable the Lo Mein, the totally affordable and always delicious Family Dinner Pack in which you get an obscene amount of food for 20 bucks, the adorable and prompt staff, the way they give you large orders in boxes so it's easier to carry, the seeded Chili sauce they provide on all the tables, the consistency of it, and also the twice cooked pork. 

I'd probably dine in a lot more if they served beer or liquor but that's not their fault, that's my Grandma's fault cause she is an alcoholic and my Mom says it's genetic."}
{"text":"The best college food there is. Recommend eating either the Five Spice Fried Squid and their $4 bowls are totally worth it"}
{"text":"Food was horrible . Dumplings barely cooked with zero flavor ! My daughter ordered the wings and they were still bloody"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to! I love the girls there! They all know me, and what I want. Boba milk tea, and hour and sour soup lol! Always friendly, always fresh, and always go above and beyond! I take all my friends there, and can never get enough of this place!

The photos do the food no justice! Everything is always steaming hot right out of the kitchen, and taste delicious!"}
{"text":"I was blown away!!! Was so authentic I wasn't sure if it would be perceived as a bad thing if I tipped."}
{"text":"I loved this place today! Lunch was fantastic: standout dishes: chow fun noodles w/dry beef OMG. I also loved the tofu chicken hot pot. I'm excited to try more on their menu! I was stuffed for 4 hours after. Very inexpensive & some of the best Chinese I have tried in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so underrated! My favorite lunch and dinner spot gives me delicious and inexpensive Chinese food.
One time, I brought my Jewish friend over to this restaurant. It was an unforgettable experience for her and every time she visits, she would ask when I will bring her back although I could just always give her the address and she can just drive back but I don't know why. She lives in Tempe. 
I like the rice bowls the best, very affordable. A $4.50 orange chicken rice bowl fills me all day. Sometimes when I'm not too hungry, I will have some leftover and be excited to heat it up after I get off work. 
Enough with the American oriented Chinese food like Panda Express but heck cheaper, you can also order authentic Chinese (Cantonese) food here. I ordered some delicious roasted pork and fried fish before as well. 
Did I not mention their fried rice? The fried rice isn't too wet or too dried. I hate sticky and wet fried rice. This restaurant has none. I love the combo one because it has seafood, beef, pork, and chicken all together. I can't decide and don't have to so I pick all of them in one dish - the best of worlds.
Their lo mein is hallelujah. One plate is huge and cheap. When I eat, I pay a lot of attention to the flavor, price, and size. This lo mein has everything I ask for. There is nothing I can take a star or two off for because the customer service is food. They serve food quickly. The area is clean enough. This is not a fancy restaurant so I don't expect a high class service."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Authentic menu and quick service. Also take out all day."}
{"text":"Get a decorator in here quick cuz....this place needs it.  While your at it get some tables and chairs that are actually comfortable to sit on (instead of the hard, rickety ones currently in use).  

The food tastes awesome and is  a very good deal with portions that are meant to be shared.  This place rates 4 stares easy dispite the uncomfortable dinning room."}
{"text":"I wish I tried this place sooner, knew it was there for years. Not exactly a place to take someone on a date, but a $3.33 special bowl off the menu will fill you up pretty good, and zero complaints about the service."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have ever had outside of China (yes, I have eaten in Beijing and other areas in China). The restaurant staff are always very friendly, professional and helpful. I am happy I discovered this restaurant actually _before_ they received (many) coveted New Times Best of Phoenix awards. They serve probably 1,000 different dishes, some cooked to order, and include Hong Kong Style. I would eat here everyday if I had the chance, and it seems many people agree. It is always a joy to eat here."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent here no matter how the decor or sitting setup is. Just enjoy the food and take in that Hong Kong cafe atmosphere.

Service is good and if you are a regular they even remember your favorite drink.

The salt-pepper fried chicken is a must try. And we love the egg plant with minced pork."}
{"text":"I am a local Hong Konger and found this place way beyond my expectation. For a small cafe it has the most variety of dishes, combos and mix and match. All fresh made and delicious. They also have specialty drinks such as boba, Hongkong styles milk tea and many more. I have been there multiple times, actually every time before I go shop at Mekong market across the street. 
It's way better than all the other Asian restaurants inside Mekong and I consider it a hidden treasure! It's a small restaurant hidden inside the corner of this half empty plaza. 
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So, warning you up front- this place has no frills. Totally a hidden hole in the wall that is in no way fancy, but has a legit menu. My favorite is towards the back of the menu for the hong kong style dishes. All dishes are reasonably priced with wings and appetizers from $2.50-4.50 and main plates from $4-8.00. Portions are huge. When my fiance and I are feeling lazy and not trying to spend too much money, we drive 5 minutes and come to Asian Cafe Express. The best deal (imo) is the family set dinner for $25.50. That includes a vegetable plate or soup, white rice ( $2 extra for fried) and then 3 entrees of your choice. For $25 it feeds us dinner, and then lunch for another few days. Easily enough for 5-6 people in my opinion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place. Everything from the food to the pricing to the service is just awesome. This is our favorite go to Asian restaurant in all of Arizona.

We've been here a few times now and we almost always get the same wonderful waitress and she always remembers our order. Our waiers are always refilled and we never need to wave anyone down to try and get another refill, unlike other places we've been to.

The food is also delicious! It's so authentic and full of flavor, and you don't have to wait too long for your order. Also, the pricing is very reasonable especially for the portion sizes they give. My boyfriend and I always pay around $15 for both our meals together, and we leave with very full bellies.

We would recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Asian restaurant in Arizona. The place is low key and not high end, but if you're really looking for authenticity and great flavor this is the place to go to. I always get the kung pao shrimp and my boyfriend gets the Mongolian beef and we both love it.

Thank you Asian Cafe Express for being awesome!"}
{"text":"HK style western foooood *heart*

Next closest place to get something like this is California *heartx2*

The menu is ginormous.  My only advice to you is to not order any of the Americanized nonsense in the front of the menu and skip to the latter half where all the good stuff is at.  I've had the Japanese bbq pork with egg over rice dish (I think that's what it's called) and, while I didn't have high expectations for it, it was surprisingly good.  The Wonton Noodle soup is probably one of the best dishes here.  Might be on the salty side for some, but that's how I like it.  The Singapore rice noodles (can't remember the english name so I'm improvising) were pretty good as well, in all it's curry-noodley goodness.

Overall, you can't really go wrong with this place.  It's good, cheap eats and that's all there really is to it."}
{"text":"The prices and portions are great.  The food is as good as it gets in metropolitan Phoenix.  The staff are very friendly but it's def a dive."}
{"text":"Just as a note, stick with the Chinese dishes if you go here.  Don't bother with the Portuguese style dishes.  They don't compare."}
{"text":"Still super good.  Went with family; six of us.  We ordered 11 dishes and two boba specialty drinks.  Total bill including tax was under $100 -- super good deal with super tasty food.  We have no complaints and always love their authentic Cantonese cooking style.  It was Sunday night and we wanted to say hello to the owners, Susan and Michael Lueng, but they were not there.  They were probably off on in Vegas enjoying themselves -- ha, ha, ha.  We love this place; especially my daughter who loves their deep fried spicy spareribs and their spicy salt and pepper calamari."}
{"text":"Unbelievable little gem in the phoenix culinary scene.  Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the prices and for once its reminiscent of Chinese food you find in Chicago!  Some dishes are a bit salty and I'm sure they use some MSG but if you want some good Chinese food try this place!!"}
{"text":"i love this place. For the price and the amount of quality food, its my favorite place.  Very simple and the price is right."}
{"text":"Negative Stars. Ordered orange chicken and broccoli beef to go, nothing special, sat around waiting for 35 minutes until lady finally remembered I was waiting and THEN proceeded to place order with kitchen."}
{"text":"Just felt the need to leave a review because I am sitting across the country in Maryland crazing Asian cafe express! Best Chinese food I've ever had and I seriously wish I could find a Chinese restaurant out here that compares but unfortunately I think I'm just going to have to wait until I come back to Arizona to visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific!  A HUGE menu makes it difficult to decide, so let your knowledgeable server help you.  Then again, in my experience, anything you order here will make you very, very happy.  The Hong Kong style dishes are super authentic, and they hit their spicier items at the perfect spice & heat levels with the \"heat\" never superseding the flavors.  The Mongolian beef, for example, leaves a little tingle on your lips, but it never feels hot.  You will love the values here; if you order an entree for each of you, you will be going home with a second meal to savor all over again.  Plus, we usually are the only non-Chinese people there.  Now that is perfection!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the price is reasonable! Orange chicken and fried rice are awesome"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite go to Asian places in the area, however,  they stopped taking to-go-orders around 19:58. So I have felt compelled to seek another venue in the area for Asian food. The food is great but the two stars is for the available service. Just disappointed overall. I hope that you all have a better experience. This is my first negative experience there.

*Update. I received excellent service from a local burger joint. I've always ordered from Asian express but maybe it's because my wife is Asian. Who knows. We've never had trouble ordering even 30 minutes before closing. I guess maybe you should have your Asian counterparts call for you if you're not Asian."}
{"text":"Great and authentic Chinese food. Waiters are very sweet and give you the space that you need. Had Mongolian beef, Kung pao chicken and orange chicken with some friends and the food is absolutely delicious! Definitely recommend coming here before spending money on expensive Chinese food."}
{"text":"The location and decor will turn a lot of people off, but I'm okay with that because it is already crazy busy. No one is going to take your name or hold a table for you. Once you see a table open up, you grab it. They usually only have one or two ladies doing tables, but they do work fast. The food is amazing and the price is unbeatable. I have never had a bad food experience here!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside, or on the inside for that matter! From the outside you might almost convince yourself to not go. Pretty basic decor but the menu is HUGE. The food is delicious and the portions are good sized. The price can't be beat! 

This would be a great place to go if you want to venture out of your normal routine. 

The egg drop soup feeds the soul! 
Crap puffs were puffy!

Honestly I don't know what I had for my main dish, a noodle dish of some sort. I asked the waitress if a certain item was good and she said well if you like spicy I would recommend this and pointed to something else. I took her advice and it was delicious! There were chunks of chicken and pork in it. Maybe a spicy peanut sauce. 
Had plenty for leftovers the next day. 

The space was busy, practically full, however we didn't wait long for our orders."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the whole family enjoyed the meal. Even my picky young daughters loved the food!"}
{"text":"Very nice service.  Very family friendly restaurant.  We went after church on a Sunday.   Lots and lots of choices on the menu.   Lots of Asian people eating here- good sign right?!  My kids had chicken noodle soup, Kung Pao Chicken and lo mein noodles.  They loved all of it.  I think the lo mein was the biggest hit with them.

My mixed vegetables were somewhat bland but fresh and edible."}
{"text":"I read the good reviews on this place and it's near mi casa so I decided to give it a try.  It was so good I was back two days later.  The staff is very nice.  The reviews from the health inspector are up and they are good!  I had a nice amount of delicious food for the price.

I ordered the spicy chicken dumplins, Vegetable lo mein and finally vegetable chow fun with soft tofu.  

Ambiance is chinese greasy spoon, but looked clean.  EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"They need for employees.We had to wait 45 minutes for our food.Then the guy waiter was so rude.Dont go there."}
{"text":"This is a good asian place, if you know what to expect.  Think a mix of Panda express prices with HK style coffeeshops.  If you expect un-oily food, better to look elsewhere.  Its Cantonese cruisine, fried with a wok and oil, definitely a little greasy.

I think they have decent american chinese food, like kung pao chicken, chow mien, terriyaki chicken bowl.  But what makes they stand out would be their huge menu of cantonese and asian food.  

The owners are adventurous and would try making dishes from other countries other than HK, like they have their take on Hainanese Chicken Rice found commonly in Singapore and Malaysia.  

I don't feel the quality of the food was compromised in anyway due to their lower price.   But due to their huge menu and having a large crowd, sometimes the standard varies a little.  Also, when the owner Michael is not cooking, sometimes his assistant makes a little different tasting dish.

I do recommend what I know.  Instead of Terriyaki Chicken, try their Curry Chicken Meat Rice, Instead of Mongolian Beef, try their Xo sauce Beef or if you dare to Bittermelon with Beef over rice.  Instead of Chow Mien, try their Beef Chow Fun.  Instead of Orange Chicken, try their HK style Sweet and Sour Pork.  Instead of a couple of meat dishes, try their Hong Kong style Grill, where U can order like 2 meats and they give u a soup, rice or spaghetti all for like 7 bucks."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this restaurant because it really gives off that authentic Chinese restaurant vibe. This might be a turn off to most people due to cultural differences, but it  personally is one of my favorite aspects of Asian Cafe. My favorite dish here is their chow fun. Their other dishes are pretty good as well. The $4 lunch menu dishes that I tried was okay. The portion size was good but the quality was obviously not the best since you get what you pay for. If you're picky with your food, the $4 lunch menu might not be the best option for you.

Their American menu is very affordable. Their Hong Kong menu has average prices. They've always seem pretty busy on all the days I've came so there is a long waiting time. The staff is friendly, but if you're East Asian they're probably just going to start speaking Chinese to you."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the prices.  
The cleanliness of this place leaves a lot to be desired, so focus on the deliciousness of the food....."}
{"text":"Easily the best Asian food I've had in the valley. I'll be coming back here, and you should too."}
{"text":"My wife had another business symposium she was attending at her school (WP Carey).

As is our normal routine, when I am not invited; I act as the chauffeur service and drop her off  on campus, and make myself scarce.

Since I already know how long these symposiums go, and she would be famished by the time it was done, I figured I would stop by one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area and order enough food for the both of us for the next two days.

Hence, I stopped by my friends at ACE. Li stopped to say hi, and asked where my wife was. I told her that she was at school, and I am ordering for the both of us. Some for me to consume here, and the rest would be for takeout.

I ordered the Salted Pork Chop, House Fried Rice, Minced Garlic Choi Sum, Chicken Curry, and House Special Pan Friend Chicken Lo Mein. I sampled a few of them, and had them pack up the rest.

As always, this place is authentic, unassuming, and simply delicious. They never fail to impress me. And the service? Well, I come to this place because they know me by name, and they are always glad that I came! (cue Cheers theme song)"}
{"text":"stoped in on the way home from work for to/go ordered the pot stickers fried not very exciting  but every thing else was great beef chow fun/ one of the shrimp dishes w broccli and a spicy chicken dish........all very tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away next to the Subway's in a shopping center at Dobson and Main is this FANTASTIC place !!  My wife and I live in Prescott Valley, and there isn't a Chinese restaurant there that deserves to be called Chinese.  Waaayyyy different story here.  They have an AZ Menu for those used to \"Americanized\" Chinese food and the Hong Kong menu for the REAL DEAL.  When we arrived at 2:15 p.m. the place was jammed and thankfully, most of the patrons were Chinese!!  That's the first \"tell\" that you have a good place.  Secondly, the Hong Kong Menu had 4 times the number of pages than the AZ Menu - -also a good sign.  My wife and I ordered 5 dishes, which amazed the waitress.  After we explained about where we lived and that there will be a takeout order as well as the leftovers, she was very happy and understood.  We had the crispy tofu, steamed chicken with vegetables, beef stew hot pot, combo chow mien and beef with XO sauce.  Everything was fantastic.  The sauce that came with the crispy tofu was a house specialty and really added a lot to a normally bland dish.  We used the same sauce on the steamed chicken, which was quite tasty by itself.  Beef with XO sauce was initially spicy, but tamed down the more of it you ate.  The  beef stew hotpot - one of the best I had anywhere and  the combo chow mein was above par.  We did have a large amount left over, which was packed to go with our added order for beef stew noodle soup, wonton noodle soup and Yangchou fried rice.  Haven't yet tried those, as it was only yesterday that we went.  However, I have no doubt that they will be even more delectable, as soup only gets better with time.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and decided on the family meal which includes five entree. We ordered broccoli beef, orange chicken, general chicken, shrimp covered in lobster sauce and a satay dish. We also ordered some appetizers of pork egg rolls, salty chicken wings and spicy dumplings. We loved the service food and tea. What a treasure to find!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, with an incredible selection.  The best Chinese food I've found in the area.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and based on the excellent reviews, I thought I would try the restaurant with my husband. On a Friday night, we arrived at around 8, the place was full. We saw people waiting outside, we thought the wait will be too long but it wasn't bad. It was a little inconvenient that although we were standing inside the restaurant for about 10 min, no body came and spoke to us so we weren't sure if it was a \"seat yourself\" situation or they're just too busy to be talking to anyone. After looking around for a while with our puzzled look and talking to the big group who was waiting before us, we ended up seating ourselves! About 3-4 min later the waitress looked at us asking how many we were and she got us the menu. A min later another waitress served us water. They gave us some time to look at the menu and waitress returned to take our order in a few min. We ordered the family (3 main course) meal which includes any 3 entrees you want, white or brown steamed rice and noodles, and to our surprise, for only $25.5! We thought the dishes must be small but to our surprise, all dishes were almost platter size! Wow, what a good deal we thought. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Beef with Broccoli and white rice. we also ordered an appetizer of spring rolls which was only $1.99 for 2 pieces, not bad. Our favorite of all dishes was the sweet and sour chicken, a 5 star dish in our opinion. It was crispy and the sauce was coating it perfectly, non of this really reddish pink sauce I don't like. We basically loved it! The rest was to us very good. We enjoyed the food and for this amount of money, this was a great experience. We saw everyone leave with boxes, and so did we. They actually pack them for you on the table, very nice. 
The reason why I had to give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because only one dish was 5* quality to us really. We will be going back for sure and will definitely order the sweet and sour chicken again. A very good find we believe!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. You know this is the best place to get Asian food because it always seems to be full of Asians. Also - I've never eaten anywhere that is as good as keeping my water glass full as these guys are. Bravo."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good authentic Chinese restaurant in Arizona, and this one was pretty good! If you guys have other suggestions, please send them my way!

Note #1: The menu is very confusing, it's not organized very well. If you have a Mandarin or Cantonese speaking friend or family member, I'd suggest bringing them so they can order their favorite dishes. 

Note #2: This is a Hong Kong style restaurant. So order Cantonese style dishes.

Here's what we got for $24 including tax and tip:
Garlic or Schezuan Eggplant
Seafood Pan Fried Noodles
Mongolian Beef

The eggplant was good, but way too much chili oil was added. There was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the dish.

The seafood crispy noodles - eh, I've definitely had better, and I was disappointed that it wasn't outstanding because this is a signature Cantonese dish. Maybe the Beef Chow Fun would've been a better choice (another signature Cantonese dish).

The Mongolian beef - American dish, so it tasted pretty American, but nonetheless, it was tasty :)

Rice is complimentary I believe, and the waitresses were VERY attentive, they kept topping off our waters."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The owners are very nice. The menu is very thick and the options are endless. They even post pictures on the wall of what the food looks like. Not only is the food really good but the prices are incredible. You have to try this place at least once. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"A buddy told me about this pace. Went with him one day. The food was great and so cheap! However, the place is dirty. Floor underneath our table was black by the wall from not being cleaned thoroughly over the years. Makes you wonder what else they aren't cleaning properly... However, I did see an \"A\" inspection report on the back wall so that's a little comforting."}
{"text":"Came here during a BUSY Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. My bf and I were seated right away and waited a bit for waters and to get ordered but after that, we were blown away. The food... Oh my goodness. We inhaled all we could in a matter of minutes. And all we could keep saying was, \"oh my god.. SO good\" ... And so affordable. Huge portions. And our waitress was the sweetest thing. So attentive and so gracious from the tip we gave her. She even bagged our leftovers for us. We would've came back that night just to order from our waitress for a dessert I was eyeing but my stomach was about to implode of delicious Chinese food. I'm so happy this place is down the street from our church because this is our new go-to!"}
{"text":"ACE makes my favorite beef chow fun, EVER.

I've never had a dish I disliked here up until last night. Hawaiian BBQ beef! Wow, not what I expected at all. I was expecting grilled beef slices (think bulbogi) but what we got was sliced up meat (similiar to the look, consistency and taste of pot roast) covered with teriyaki sauce. Umm, for reals? Never would've I imagined. But that's what happens when you take someone who is not too familiar with Chinese food and you do the everyone choose one dish and we'll share route. It was so bad I had to comment, \"When you go to a Chinese place, order Chinese dishes.\" lol.

Anyway, no worries beef chow fun made everything better.

I've been here numerous times now and have enjoyed everything else I've had. Some of my favorites include:

-Beef with Scramble Egg sauce over rice.
-Salt & Pepper Squid
-Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings
-Orange Chicken
-Baked Pork Chop spaghetti
-Mongolian Chicken
-Fried Rice
-Lo Mein

I haven't really ventured towards their more traditional chinese dishes but some day I finally will. I saw stir fry pickled chinese mustard that really intrigued me. It's one of my favorite homestyle dish. But I'll save that for a solo meal because it has an acquired taste.

Oh and their taro coconut tapioca drink is yummy. It reminds me of a taro dessert my mom would make. It's creamy, coconut milk with taro chunks, sweetened and with little clear tapioca pearls. 

*Also, their menu stated that they will cook fresh raw seafood for you. You just have to bring in the receipt alongside. It's $5 each dish and you can choose from a long list of sauces/styles you would like to have it prepared. Very convienent with Mekong Market across the street. Yummm... I think I may have to return with a lobster to have them make me lobster with gravy over e fu noodles."}
{"text":"I had to think really hard about what this restaurant was actually called - my friends just refer to it as \"the cheap chinese place\".

The restaurant looks homely, but it's always bustling.  The menu is indeed enormous, and the walls are covered with even more meal options.  They offer everything from fairly pedestrian Americanized Chinese food (lo mein, orange chicken, rice bowls) to authentic Hong Kong-style menu options.

Portions are plentiful and many dishes are seriously budget-priced - you can get a rice bowl for about $4.  My favorite dishes are tofu with black mushrooms and the veggie chow fun.  

Next time you're in the mood for Chinese, skip the buffet and come here for your fix - you'll get much better quality food for your money."}
{"text":"My family and I have been searching for several years for a good Chinese food place after our family favorite closed down. Finally - we have found a place that is not just good but amazing and cheap! 

My family and I are very picky. There are 7 of us, all with different preferences and pallets. It's hard to please all of us at one place. The food here though, everyone loved! 

We did the family style dinner which had more than enough food and super cheap! We got the orange chicken, sweet n sour chicken, Mongolian beef, Hong Kong shrimp as part of the family dinner. It also came with lo Mein, fried rice and white rice. That was all part of the dinner and was delicious! We loved their dumpling appetizer and it came with 10 of them!! All of their sauces were absolutely amazing. 

I had been saving my salt intake for this, so if your sodium intake was high (and if you have to watch it like I do) don't eat here until you're low. 

Sadly it's far away from where we live. I just wish it was closer!"}
{"text":"Had their bitter melon with scrambled eggs dish. Decently made, also pretty hard to find bitter melon dishes around here, so I was impressed. Came back on Lunar New Year and had their steamed whole chicken, stir fried choy sum, tofu hot pot, dumplings, sweet & sour soup, and spicy chicken wings, all of which tasted ok."}
{"text":"Bomb ass food. Me and my date ate general chicken, house chow fun and egg rolls. Errthing was good, waitress was good. But she stayed busy because short staffed."}
{"text":"Not the fanciest place, but the food is fantastic. Love the noodles - Singapore style noodles and beef chow fun."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after a wonderful visit at QC reflexology; felt so relaxed. Maybe everybody should visit QC reflexology before coming here. :-))

As soon as you walk in, one can tell this looks like a restaurant that serves an  AUTHENTIC Chinese foods.

I found a table and sat myself, however, it took over 6 minutes for a server to stop by. Then it took another 10 minutes for my ice tea and the menu. 

It took another 20 minutes or so before my food started to show up on my table. The service was slow (took one star).

The food was great! Some of it reminded me of the foods I had tried back in Singapore. I ordered the following:

Fried Rice
Steam Chicken
Hot & Sour Soup
Clams with Black Beans
Special Noodle Soup

You can also bring your own Seafood and they will cook it for you. If you want, you could go across the street to Mekong and purchase Crabs or Lobster and bring them to this restaurant and they will cook it for you. I am going to try that.

Service is very slow so be prepared for it or do what I did, visit QC reflexology first, then you will be very relaxed."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  They mislead the public and overcharge for basically providing nothing.  I ordered the fried tofu with vegetables and rice vermicelli noodles.  I was given 3 cabbage leafs half a bag of noodles and half a container of deep fried tofu for 8.95.  I read the reviews on yelp before I went hoping this would at be acceptable Asian food but instead I got flavorless noodles, tofu and cabbage.  3 leaves of cabbage isn't vegetables.  The entire meal isn't worth $3 let alone $8.  The service is terrible, the food horrible, over priced and bland.  Maybe if you don't know how to make the noodles or fry tofu you could be tricked into thinking they gave you something of value but the same noodles are $.50 across the street at Mekong, the tofu $1 and I am fairly certain the cabbage they would give you for free.  I called once we got home and they defended their product.  I will never go here again and I suggest you do the same. I actually opened this yelp account today just to write this review."}
{"text":"Ive eaten authentic and delicious Chinese food in China, the bay area California, and LA, CA.

This makes it onto my short list for good Chinese food in the Phoenix/Mesa area.  I can only think of 4 places I would go for Chinese food in this area.  Definitely going back.  Try the Chicken in Black Bean Sauce.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food, the restaurant inside is not fancy, it looks like your typical dive Asian spot. Don't let the looks device you, the food is on point. It may difficult to understand the waitress with her thick accent, but everyone is incredibly nice."}
{"text":"Pros: Fast service, extensive menu, very inexpensive, large portions. The food came out so steaming hot that my eyeglasses fogged up. Menus are in English and Chinese and Chinese speakers were picking up \"to-go\" orders so this looked like a good sign.
Cons: I ordered orange chicken with brown rice. The sauce tasted odd, the rice was fine, but the chicken was dried out (to the point that much of it was impossible to eat) and the sauce and the breading on the chicken had an odd metallic taste. I could not finish the food as I was feeling queasy about half way through. I continued to have this unpleasant taste in my mouth for about another hour (even with drinking copious amounts of water to rinse out my mouth).
I really wanted to like this place based on other Yelp reviews and the fact that it is locally owned and not a chain, but I really cannot recommend the food here."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! Best Chinese food in the valley! Coming from Boston, I missed good and authentic Chinese. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food, Fried Rice amazing, Orange chicken & steamed pot sticker.  My new favorite place"}
{"text":"I was looking for Asian restaurants and this one came up. I saw many good reviews, I stopped by for early dinner.
It was around 4:30pm and wasn't busy at all, but there were some groups dining in.

There were so many food selections, but there were pictures on the wall which helped.
I ordered Japanese BBQ pork noodles soup. My food came about 10 minutes after ordering. 
When I saw my food at first, the portion wasn't big, but once I started eating, I was wrong. Lots of pork and noodles. I wish they put some veggies. However, the broth had enough seasoning as well as pork.

The service and staff were okay. Nothing great. The prices were very reasonable. 
Walking distance from the light rail station. I will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is one great Asian restaurant. Their portion size is legendary. Their service is good. We visit this place monthly if not more common. This place is always packed with lots of diners. I highly recommend this to everyone."}

{"text":"I visited Asian Cafe Express for the first time after grabbing a menu when I was waiting for food from a different Korean restaurant in the area a month or so back. I must say, I am very happy with my meal. I've been searching for a place like this near my work for a long time and I believe I have found it. As I said, I've tried many different places and I'm usually disappointed, but from the first bite to the last, I am very pleased. I purchased the Mongolian Chicken and it is amazing. Very flavorful, a slight heat (not overwhelming as far as I'm concerned), but the flavor profile all comes together very well. I will definitely be adding them to my lunch rotation. I'm so excited that I finally found a place that I can trust to order from close by where I won't end up disappointed when I order something random from the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious!

We really enjoyed the food at Asian Cafe Express!!  We tried several apps, as well as, several different meals.  We had the pork egg rolls, the pork dumplings, and the chile salted chicken wings.  All delicious!

For the meals, we had pork fried rice, beef and broccoli, and the Hong Kong Chinese broccoli and beef.  Again, all was delicious!!

You get a ton of food, so we were able to take some home for leftovers.

Wonderful place to eat!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant once.  They used so much MSG that my mouth hurt afterwards.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place gets a bump because it could easily pass for a set in a John Woo film and because there's just so much bad chinese food in the Phoenix.  Like a person that looks better by hanging around ugly friends, ACE benefits similarly.

Many reviewers call the place gritty.  I rather think it's more that the owners just don't give a damn about the dining room.  With food this flavorful and inexpensive, neither should you.  And as long as you don't, you'll be treated to some of the most flavorful and uniquely flavored Chinese food in the Valley."}
{"text":"After shopping at Mekong the family decided they were hungry.  I thought we were going home, but NOPE!  So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.

From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.

First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.

Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.

Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).

The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors

I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this \"as good as it gets\"?  No.

I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Chinese places in the Tempe area. I order chicken lo Mein and steamed rice every time I go to Chinese and ACE had the freshest take out food I've ever had! It was extremely inexpensive and heated up well!! Highly recommend to anyone! I will be taking my friends and family here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year and like pretty much anything I order. The variety is great and caters to almost anybody that walks in. The prices are absolutely fair, especially with the healthy portions they serve. Unfortunately but as I've come to expect from my favorite restaurants, service is slow, forgetful, and at times rude. I do not hold this against them though, because I know the food is worth it. I recommend trying as much as you can. They even have Hong Kong Crispy Noodle. Be weary of the Boba though it can be disappointing at times, but the Milk Tea is always good. Enjoy your meal and make it an adventure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Great price. Good portions. The staff is always kind and friendly and ready to refill that water at moments notice. Definitely recommend coming here for some great Asian grub!"}
{"text":"Today I was having an Asian withdrawal as it had been quite a while since I last ate Asian cuisine.  I was in Apache Junction and did a Yelp search.  I could not find a place so looked in Mesa and Asian Cafe came up on top.  Being hungry I said this is it.

Was I disappointed for driving so far?  Not one bit.  The menu plunked down in front of me was like a telephone book...thick with many pages.  A quick flip through the pages told me what I needed to know.  The tough part was to not order the old standby....Kung Pao Chicken.  No, today I decided to order the more difficult dish to make; the Mongolian Beef with egg fried brown rice.

The Mongolian Beef was perfect in every way.  Every morsel of meat was tasty and most important tender and this is the hardest part for most Asian places.  The brown sauce had just the perfect level of heat that was consistent throughout the entire dish.  Also the right amount of onions as well.  I did not want to stop eating and I ordered the regular dish which was enough for 2 people.  I can't imagine what the Large dish would be like.

The egg fried brown rice was perfectly done and again the best fried rice I've had in quite a while.

A no time during this meal did I feel any need to add more heat.

I also had the \"Regular\" Hot Sour Soup.  This is one dish I have the hardest time finding to be perfect my way.  I don't want it watery but just the right thickness and it was.  I want spring onions and most don't have it.  This one not only has the spring onion but a regular onion as well.

Since I could not eat all of the food presented I took it home and had it today for lunch.  It was every bit just as good as it was in the restaurant and that is also a first as most Asian dishes loose a lot when reheated.

The last interesting note to make is.....there was no fortune cookie with the tab.  This was also a first and I believe that is because the Asian Cafe Express is a true Hong Kong style restaurant where I don't remember getting a fortune cookie.

Would I go back?  In a hearbeat.  This will be my go-to place for Asian food as the menu is extensive.  A place for \"good eats\"."}
{"text":"This place is five star all the way. I particularly like  asian food, and have had it all over town and also in other states. This food is special. You really feel like you are in another country when you step inside. The place is very dated with pictures of the food covering the walls. Chopsticks in a cup on the table and hot chili oil in a squeeze bottle. The menu is one of, if not the largest Chinese menus I have ever had the pleasure of holding. This place cooks things I have never even heard of. If you have not been here you are actually doing yourself  a disservice.  The portions you get are gargantuan,  no other place in the whole city gives you that much food for the money. You will just have to come here to even comprehend that, and I'm serious. I have never once been able to finish my food. Food taste is extremely fresh and as far as I can tell, authentic. The baby bok choy alone is worth coming for, and it's in a lot of dishes. If you like Chinese food, this needs to be on the very top of your list. Very highly reccomeded. I will be coming here for many years and thank the lord I found it."}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express is my favorite Chinese restaurant!  I think the service is great, the food is even better.  I've been eating here for years.  My favorites from their menu are the Chow Fun noodles (both dry or \"gravy\" are awesome! I like the Combo best, but my husband likes the beef)  Mongolian Chicken, and Black Pepper Beef, but there are a ton of other great options."}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite but Going down hill. Cheap, but you get what you pay for. I have been paying a little more lately, and going elsewhere. Greasy and the cuts of meat are cheap. Not on the Band list yet, Ill give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Food is great, but they are always busy. It looks like they are under staff. I like going to a restaurant where I can enjoy my food. It is way too loud and the food takes too long."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Cheap! Fresh! Busy - had to wait for them to clean tables. The fried dumplings were great but all greasy. The shrimp fried rice was a bit lacking shrimp but for five bucks, can't complain."}
{"text":"Real, authentic Chinese cuisine at its finest. A small hole in the wall place. I had the combo chow fun, and it was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Depending on what you order, some of the menu items are really good.  Today I had the Iced Red Bean Drink.  It is very good.  Nice cool refreshing taste for the blazing heat.

Today I had the salt & pepper fried squid.  First class.  The squid was fresh, soft, and succullent.  Taste was just perfect.   Fried squid at most places taste like rubber or hard frozen squid.  Well not here.  Very fresh and soft.  Probably the best fried squid in Phoenix.  The portion was huge.  It filled up the whole big to go box.  And it was only $9.00."}
{"text":"The food here is good! I like that they have some authentic Chinese food options here. We usually stop in here when we are craving some authentic Chinese food. We ordered wonton noodle soup, braised beef noodles, chicken wings, and salt and pepper shrimp. Both noodle dishes were really good and the salt and pepper shrimp was great!"}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express, or ACE, hasn't changed much over the last few years. Located in a nondescript shopping center in Mesa, the interior doesn't get much better than the outside. But you don't come here to be wowed by the interior design, even if you do think the plastic lobsters on the wall are pretty cool, it's all about the food.

Open the menu and within a few pages you'll see typical Chinamerica offerings, such as sweet and sour, lo-mein and fried rice. But keep turning the pages and you'll find some serious real deal Chinese food.


The best value is the Family Meal ($21.29), consisting of three large items, rice and noodles. This is a feast that can easily feed four or more.

Even more impressive is what the kitchen can do with fresh seafood. Across the street from ACE is Mekong Supermarket, an Asian grocer that has a massive fresh seafood counter. Diners can purchase fresh seafood from Mekong, then take it to ACE, where the chef cooks the catch for around $8 per item.

Our party of seven arrived at ACE with bags full of goodies we were greeted and seated, then a brief consultation began. We had purchased live seafood from Mekong's water tanks, including crab ($8.99 a pound), clams ($7.99 a pound) and two lobsters ($9.99 a pound). We also chose a large wide mouth bass ($8.99 a pound) that was cleaned by the Mekong fish monger.

Starting with the bass, the chef simply steamed the fish, then topped with a sauce of ginger and fresh spring onions. The fish was sublime -- fresh, meaty and tender without a hint of fishiness.

The clams were also steamed to perfection with a light sauce of black beans and spring onion. Each tender mollusk was a joy to eat with slight saltiness from the black beans.

Our crab was treated with a dredge of garlic, salt and pepper, then deep-fried. The chef was spot on, making a contrast between the luscious crab meat and the wonderful seasoning. While the crab was still in its shell, it was hacked up into more accessible pieces.

Finishing the feast, we \"oohed\" and \"aahed\" as our lobsters were brought to the table. Both lobsters were chopped into pieces, then stir-fried with green onion and ginger and served on top of a bed of crispy pan-fried noodles. They tasted as good as they looked. The lobster meat was so sweet and delicious I wanted to lick the plate clean. A bonus of flavor was hidden as the juices from the lobster were absorbed by the bed of noodles.

This was such a pleasant experience that I'd let the chef at ACE take the wheel for an evening of delectable surprises anytime."}
{"text":"good boba milk tea!  wonderful food. had the Mongolian beef and chicken wings w/ fried rice. the beef was subtely spicy and very flavorful. I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the family dinner 3 item, it was a great value, and great food.  When I go back in will call first, the place is always busy!!"}
{"text":"First time here food was extremely good but service needs improvement....waited too long for food and way too long for check"}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona and was looking for a good Chinese restaurant like the ones in Dallas. I went  after seeing all the reviews and I was very pleased. I was craving the Beef Chow Fun and it was awesome as everyone said it was. I can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu.

For good authentic Chinese food this is the place to go. I was a little disappointed on how long it took to get my togo order but after trying the food and the girls were very nice which made up for the long wait, it gets my 5 stars.

I will definitely go back especially since its only 5 minutes from my office. Major plus."}
{"text":"you just can't beat the bowls here for 3.98 you get a lot of chinese food.."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Being from Southern CA and a sister living in the San Fran area, I have access to some great Chinese food options.  

Finding a great Chinese restaurant in AZ is seemingly impossible.  After four years of searching, I started to give up.  Through the help of Yelp, I found this place and decided to give this place a try.

I pretty much get the same two items every time I'm there, combo fried rice and beef satay egg noodle soup.  I will also experiment with one other item from time to time.  I've never been disappointed and on average each item is only $5.00 and if it's just yourself or sharing with one other person, there will be plenty of leftovers.  Great food with leftovers for $10.00!  Also, I'll get Tapioca with Boba from time to time and that's great too.  

The service is also very good here.  Always attentive to needs (like refilling water cups) and the food comes out quickly enough and well prepared.  It's clear that English is a second language for the waitresses, but I've never had any problems.

Yes, the place is a hole in the wall and a bit dumpy, but the food makes up for it 100 times over.  

The place is a bit far from me, but I do make my way out there at least once a week and I haven't gone to any other Chinese restaurant in AZ since discovering this GEM!"}
{"text":"Cheap as cheap gets for a sit down diner.  The food comes out fast, hot, and delicious.  The menu is HUGE and the number of dishes may boggle your mind.  Some dishes I would recommend are:

Beef stew noodle soup: the meat in here is wonderfully tender and the soup is fantastic.

Black pepper chicken: has a very flavorful sauce and is delicious over rice.

Fried rice: generic, I know, but still one of my all-time favorites.

House noodles: also very flavorful.  these pan fried noodles have a great sauce and come with meat and veggies!

Overall, not the classiest restaurant, but it is extremely worth it for the price, especially on a college student budget!  It's also accessible from the light rail, and right across from the asian market, which makes the location rather convenient."}
{"text":"Extremely busy for 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Had to wait for a table to be cleaned.  You can tell they do alot of business. .. but the interior needs a good scrubbing.  The bathrooms are filthy,  the high chairs are black with grease..i can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The food was good. .. you hey what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very cheap restaurant to eat at and they serve very heavy portions. I prefer to eat at this place when I'm feeling quite unhealthy :) Definitely recommend their Mongolian beef! One of the best Chinese cuisines in Arizona."}
{"text":"By far and away my favorite for asian food.  Large menu to choose from.  And they always seem to remember you there."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food is my motto for this place.  Found this place right after getting back from a trip to China and I'm well satisfied with their tasty choices.  The menu is filled with a nice variety of noodle, vegetable, and meat dishes, along with soups and stews.  They've done a commendable job of maintaining A ratings from the Health Inspector, which isn't often found in the Asian restaurant community.  The staff are friendly and efficient - another big plus."}
{"text":"The Chinese food was delish here. They had two different styles to choose from. Hong-Kong Style and Chinese -American. Really satisfied with my dish. I got General Tso Chicken with Fried Rice. Enough for lunch for 2 days. I also shared a regular portion of the Chow Mein with coworker. Best idea ever. Noodles very tender, seasoned just right. No need to even use soy sauce...cant wait to go back next month!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great pricing, great service. This is as authentic as Chinese food gets over here along with the affordable price. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard, when our group arrived around 8 30 and the restaurant is still pretty packed. Probably the best Hong Kong style cafe in metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Red Hot Chili Peppers - Under The Bridge)

It's hard to believe
That there's no good Chinese food
It's hard to believe
That I'm so hungry
At least I have her food
The cafe she loves me
Bo Bites as I am
Together we try

I don't ever want to feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

(Asian Cafe Express!)
Is where I ate some rice
(Asian Cafe Express!)
I could not get enough
(Asian Cafe Express!)
Don't forgot about my spice!
(Asian Cafe Express!)
I had to Yelp away..........

Cheap good Chinese style cuisine from all parts of the China!

Sha-wha!? No it's Shu Mai stupid!  Anyways, came here with 6 friends and we were going to do it the hard way; everyone order something, but instead we saw the Family Style Dinners.  They had every region: Hong Kong, Northern, Szechuan, and even Spicy!  Not sure where the spicy region came from, but we decided against it this time around since one of my buddies is wimp when it comes to spice.  Along with the Family style comes with fried rice, white rice, and chow mein.  Our 5 sides we order were XO Beef, Mapo Tofu, Fried Tofu, Calamari, and the last dish was Chicken, but not sure what it was called!  My bad peeps!  

Overall my favorite was the XO Beef and Calamari.  Just enough spice on the beef dish while the calamari was perfectly seasoned and breaded to a crunch munch!  Service was friendly and fast, but the place was definitely a dive!  In the end, the bill came to about $50 for 6 people, but we couldn't even finish -- Fail! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese takeout on a budget that kicks the shit out of Panda Express. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in the east valley. It's a hole in the wall type of restaurant. Run for a family, NEVER DISAPPOINTS !
Prices are more than fair, service is always good, even at the rush hours, when is a little slow.
The flavors, the quantity and prices are hard to beat. 
The menu is huge, so you will find something to love for sure!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food! Lots of variety!!! All great!!! Wish they were closer, because it would definitely be our go-to place! So glad we found this place thru word-of-mouth."}
{"text":"suuuuuper cheap good eats. they'd stay open late for our fellowship group on Friday nights. So nice! i enjoy the visual stimulation from the food pictures on the walls (helpful if you're not familiar with what \"sunshine pork\" looks like... ), as well as the fact that they \"would not add MSG.\" The typos typical of Asian menus are quite endearing here. The staff here is also SUPER nice. 

The House special fried rice is reallllly good... and actually, i haven't met a dish here that i didn't like. Granted, it's not THE BEST food i've ever had, but it's good, and did i mention how cheap it is? I think almost everything is under $6. It's fun because the menu also offers a bit of a variety of different asian cuisines. 

i recommend the beef stew curry. mostly because it comes in its own little mini wok, which is SO FREAKIN CUTE! oh yeah, it tastes good too."}
{"text":"Called in for pick up. Got Calamari, Yang Chow Fried Rice and their Chicken Wings. Food is cheap. For 7.99 their Calamari wasn't great. The flour that they used was just not good. It should be crispy but when we got it it was falling apart and chalky. It doesn't compliment the softness of the calamari. The yang chow is okay for a 5 dollar fried rice. Wings are a bit over cooked but i ordered wings here before and it was okay. Will come back to try other items cos they have a huge selection. But yeah nothing spectacular. Just cheap."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  There were so many options on the menu, we were a bit overwhelmed at fist.  Ended up getting:

Hong Kong Milk Tea - strong like in Hong Kong, no kidding :)
Salt spare ribs appetizer - not bad, but a bit too \"fried\"
Twice cooked pork - delicious and not too spicy
Ginger onion fish fillet - a winner if you like white fish
Yang chow fried rice - simple but good

There was so much food it took two days to finish.  Will def go back and next time might go with one of their preset meals, the seafood one looked good.  Place was very busy, obviously many others enjoy it too.  Highly recommended if you are in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the good reviews on here. I was not disappointed! There food is sooo delicious and the flavor is always spot on. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I just wish the place was bigger so we can eat in more often."}
{"text":"I admit it.  I love Cantonese food and seek it wherever I go.  This is a nice concept place with more home-style dishes; things I might be able to make if I read up and practiced.  However, eating here is a lot easier.  It's decent, fast, cheap, with no grease spills to cleanup afterwards.  It's not amazing, but it is a perfect place for getting a quick Chinese lunch."}
{"text":"I have not had other Chinese or Asian cuisine in the Phoenix area so the review is in comparison to the Bay Area and the reality that there is a relatively small Asian population in the area. The waitress (most likely owner) was really sweet. She recommended a stir fry with bok choi, beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, and shitake mushrooms. Basically the kitchen sink. We also ordered gai lan sauteed with garlic and salty/peppery deep fried chicken. The stir fry and veggies were a bland version of traditional chinese home cooking. The fried chicken which is normally very salty was a mixture of sweet and savory. The cold milk tea was decent. 

As previous posts have mentioned before, the decor is nonexistent. It looks like a Subway with the booth seating except the color palate is pink."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place
But the food makes up for it.
Tasty, authentic.

Menu is a mess;
Unorganized, redundant.
Too many pages.

Attentive servers
Your cup will always be full.
They are allllways there.

Fish dish, ample fish.
Ma po tofu, spicy good.
Eggplant, delightful.

Very decent price.
Best deals for families, but
I'd go for myself."}
{"text":"Tasty in that oily, gonna-mess-you-up-tomorrow sense of the word. Inexpensive and generous portion sizes. Had the family meal of 3 entrees, rice and lo mein for 4 people for $20. General chicken, pepper beef, and pork spare ribs - not the most authentic perhaps and maybe that's why I'm only so-so on the place, but we've only ourselves to blame for the selections."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in quality and price and service!!! 2-3x a month we eat there after church.."}
{"text":"The retro hole in the wall vibe gives off a comforting atmosphere. As you soak up the vinyl and enjoy the 90's esk environment you cant help but be drawn to the delicious smells coming from the kitchen. Teresa was bubbly and friendly and helped me pick out just what I wanted. She interpreted what i wanted perfectly. I recommend this gem to anyone in the area. Don't let the cover judge this book. 

Seconds Please!"}
{"text":"Good. Cheap. Asian. Food. That's just about all you need to know. Short wait and cheap prices. So cheap that you will think it's fast food. This place is legit. If you have a more traditional taste, they got you. If you want a more American style, they got you. They have everything you need here. The menu is huge, which typically means the place isn't good, that's not the case. It's awesome!  Do yourself a favor and try it out."}
{"text":"Great food! Made me feel like I was in Rowland Heights, CA. That's a big compliment because there are Hong Kong style cafes everywhere you turn in RH. And they have great food. Well, this place didn't fall behind in any aspect.

The Chili chicken dimpling is very good. The fried dimpling was average. The fried Shrimp was crispy and flavorful. The Chili salt chicken wings were excellent! The black pepper chicken over Brown rice was very good as well. Overall, very good food and service! 

Great job being the first Hong Kong style cafe in AZ! I would definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this is some of the best Chinese food we have ever had! We came to spoil ourselves after the warrior dash and I trusted the repetition in the reviews to get beef chow fun, the hubby got his usual orange chicken. We felt happiness in our hearts after diggin in (covered in dirt, smelly, hungry)... the orange chicken was very very good.  The beef chow fun was so amazing! I am full of so many mixed emotions now! Sadness-\"why ace, why are you soooooo far from my home\"... relief-\"thank goodness this is sooooo far, I would gain 20 pound this year if it were closer... anger-\"surprise Chinese food places should burn to the ground for serving the food they serve!\"... joy-\"in both my mouth and tummy\"...

Thank you ace!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food standby.
I almost always get the same thing, and it's always reliably excellent.
Typically, I grab it after or during work--So calling ahead and picking up my order is the way I do things.
Prices and portions are great, food is always delicious, and I've never had a reason to complain."}

{"text":"I don't normally eat Chinese food..but when I do, it's usually Panda Express...although I think I may drive out of my way to go here more often.  The food was amazing!  We had the seafood chow fun and mapo tofu.  Both were excellent and the portions were gi-normous.  Have I mentioned cheap yet?  The only con is that we had to wait a REALLY long time to get our food.. so bring some friends to chat with while you're waiting for the goodness."}
{"text":"The worst service ever had!
Honestly, the food here is very good given its price. And even though Chinese restaurants are typical of its relative poor service, I have to say this one has the worst service among all the restaurants I have ever tried. Slow, rude and unprofessional. Come here only for take out."}
{"text":"Norm recommended this place when the restaurant 3 of us wanted to go to was closed on Sundays. It was worth the drive to Mesa. There is all sorts of stuff on the menu and they will explain any of the items as well as offer some customization. You better be hungry, the food is not only good but large servings too. The atmosphere is very upbeat. There is nothing fancy but the service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and am finally getting around to writing a review for this place. This place has amazing food that is so incredibly cheap! The waitresses are some of the nicest people you will ever meet and know me and what kinda of food I like and keep in mind to my family's food allergies. The food is authentic Hong Kong Style cooking as you are going to get in Arizona. They have a wide selection of dishes that has something for everyone!
     I must say, this place needs a bit of an update with the interior or maybe just even a bigger restaurant. They have such a huge fan base that I think they would benefit from increasing the inside or reorganizing the inside of the restaurant to seat more people. There have been times where I have waited quite a while to even get seated because they were just so busy! Which I would recommend either eating somewhere else for the night or come back in a few hours so that you do not have to wait so long. They get very busy around dinner time on the weekends, I recommend for the best experience, to go for lunch during the week because there are very few people during that time. Other than the wait time, this place is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were very helpful when deciding on where to eat when I was in AZ for MLB spring Training.. We got the family meal great deal tons of food w/ leftovers and who doesnt like chinese food leftovers.. This restaurant was not far from our hotel.. The Decor and atmosphere is not the greatest but you go for the food not pictures on wall. The restaurant had alot of Asians it was packed so you know its good. Also staff had to all be family very nice helpful and some of the best chinese food I have had!! Great food and good times I definately would return!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese I have had in the East Valley.  ONLY order from the Hong Kong Style menu. Anything with the scrambled eggs is delicious!  We really loved the pork with yellow leeks and bean sprouts.  The soup was amazing too. Great prices and fresh food.  We WILL be back"}
{"text":"Great service, great variety, delicious food, large portions, great prices. Best Chinese in town!!"}
{"text":"Thank you ACE for making our recent dinning experience a great one.  You prepared our seafood selection that we had just purchased from Mekong Supermarket.....perfectly. Our tilapia was steamed with scallions, ginger and cilantro. Thank you for leaving the face on our fish. To some it's creepy but to us it was necessary. Our catfish was fried and seasoned with just the right amount of spice with tasty crunchy bits at the bottom of the plate. Our lobster was amazing! I don't recall the prep style we selected but it was painfully delicious.  We also selected a noodle option and steamed rice to accompany our meal.  A very very good meal prepared by very good people.  See you soon!"}
{"text":"YUM!  We crave Asian Cafe Express at least twice a month.  My co-workers and I to drive out to Mesa (from Phx) for lunch.  Yes, we love it that much.  The menu is huge!  I do not think we have ordered the same dish for lunch yet?  Love the Boboa drinks too!"}
{"text":"Although my cousin had a hair in her vegetables, the food overall was good! You definitely get your money's worth here. I did not expect such big portions for that low of a price!"}
{"text":"Large portions for cheap. Recommend Black Pepper Chicken. No additional charge for brown rice. If you go when its crowded be prepared to wait for awhile. Lunch time service is much quicker. This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Tempe/Mesa."}
{"text":"This place is definitely THE place to eat when you're craving, a good (great amount) amount of, quality, AFFORDABLE, Asian food. My cousin introduced me to this place and needed a little conviction for me to agree to eat there. Needless to say,  now I have to convince him to go whenever we eat out. Rarely do I get so excited for a restaurant, but this one definitely deserves it. Servers are so friendly and professional. You will not regret going there. A++ 10/10."}
{"text":"VALUE! VALUE! VALUE! Is it the best Chinese meal you'll ever have? Lord, I hope not. But it's good \"traditional\" Chinese food dirt cheap. $3.98 lunch bowl is the best bargain in the Valley. A big-a$$ platter of Black Pepper Chicken or Hawaiian Sauce (sorta Teriyaki-ish) Pork or Chicken over brown rice is just the thing. Hot, tasty, filling, comforting and inexpensive. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If there was an ACE near my house I'd go broke. Food is so good and price is cheap for how much you get!  Great quality and taste for an amazingly cheap price. Try the Chinese coffee with milk tea and Mao Po tofu!"}
{"text":"We were amazed at how busy this place was on a random weeknight!  I called to place an order and could hear how chaotic and loud it sounded in the background.  When we came to pick up the order, every table was full and there was a line of people waiting to pick up their food.  

We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein, pork egg rolls, orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  You have the option of two different sizes of each item wen ordering.  The small sizes are plenty big and we had so much leftover food.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken were both really crispy and the lo mein was loaded with chicken and veggies.  I wish they delivered, but since they don't, I guess I will have to brave the crowds because it's the best Asian food I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"I visited this past Friday. I ordered orange chicken with white rice, and wings as an appetizer. The food was PERFECT, and an amazing value! My main dish was around $4, FOUR DOLLARS (and some change). The portion was also great, I had leftovers. The orange chicken had a savory crisp layer and reminded me of another great Chinese Food restaurant located in the Chinese Cultural Center off 44th Street in Phoenix. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Since my last review my husband and I had been here a few times without any further issues of finding hair in our food. My husband picked this up for dinner on Friday and I've been deathly ill since about two o'clock Saturday morning. 37 hours of extreme food poisoning and counting. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona. This place is like a diamond in the rough. We had the Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Fun, and the soup of the day (daikon and pork I believe). Absolutely delicious! The place was constantly filled with people. The service was spectacular. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! But so does everybody and their mothers.

To be a take-out l33t: call ahead to place an order, otherwise you're gonna have to wait because the restaurant is always packed. 
Make sure to order off the Hong Kong Style Menu. 
It's 10 pages long, so if you're indecisive, just close your eyes and point to something. It'll probably be good.

No surprise it's always busy here, as they're practically giving the food away at those price points."}
{"text":"Was sent here by a friend after we went to have Chinese food a couple of months ago. He told me that I had to try to this place as it was one of the best places he had Mongolian Beef--ever! At first I could not find the restaurant and thought that maybe it had closed. But, after driving past the Subway and looking up I finally found it. I was extremely hungry and walked as quickly as I could to the back where the check out counter was. I had to wait for a few minutes as the wait staff was running around trying to fill orders in the cramped and crowded dining area. The dining area has about 15 tables and depending on how many folks are sitting at the table you may or may not be able to get by. Finally one of the waiters acknowledged me and I ordered the large shrimp and vegetables, which with tax only totaled $8.50. 

I decided to take a seat and immediately a waitresses acknowledged me and tried to hand me a menu. I explained to her that I was just sitting waiting for my order--she smiled and moved on. The restaurant is very small and packed full of people--but for the price and food it is worth being a little cramped. All of the food on their tables looked amazing. I waited for about 10 minutes for my food and it was so worth the wait. The shrimp and vegetables were lightly covered in a white sauce and it was all piping hot. There were large chunks of broccoli and carrots--unfortunately you could barely see the 10-12 little shrimp floating around; but it was a great meal. I will definitely be coming back in a couple of weeks to sit in and enjoy their food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The menu is a little hard to understand and use, but once you receive the food, it doesn't matter anymore. The service isn't the greatest, but they always kept the water cups full. I love that they will cook your seafood if you bring it in yourself! Great place, overall. Will be back often."}
{"text":"It is hard to find such a great restaurant like this one.

Food : GREAT!!!!
Service: GOOD!!!!
Price of food : You cannot find elsewhere. It is very reasonable.

In conclusion - you have to try it yourself."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  The food is always good.  Sometimes this place can get packed though, but its worth the wait.  They have a really good lunch special deal.  I like their orange chicken the best."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, you'd get your money worth if you decide to come here (don't believe me? Try the family style combo you'll get plenty of food for $25). It's a pretty basic looking chinese resto off of Phoenix Asian strip (I meant along Dobson, for some reason most Asian resto/market concentrated along this street..don't ya think?). Food quantity is good but quality? I think they can do a bit better, hence the four stars. Service is so so depending how tired the servers are (don't blame them, looks like they're there erreday from open to close) but they always box your leftovers for ya so can't complain! Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Try their wings, black pepper chicken, fish & bokchoy, combo xo fried rice, crispy ribs chow mein with black bean sauce and the coffee milk tea with boba! :)"}
{"text":"The Food was good/decent. Some dishes are way better than the others. It wasnt terrible and it was great. The price is pretty good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Their honking style food is very good. As far as taste and quality is concerned, this is more inline with a five star Hong Kong restaurant. The atmosphere is not upper scale but the food certainly makes up for it. Their high ratings is well deserved."}
{"text":"ACE is our go to Asian spot for food.  We still had to go with our black bean chicken dish. They have a host of black bean dishes with shrimp, calamari, or beef.  The black bean chicken is by far our favorite.

We also got a seafood chow fun.  The chow fun comes with a white sauce. We opted for a brown gravy instead.  Add a little hot chili pepper sauce to your noodles and you're ready to go. As always, the food is on point and good tasting. Great service. Best of all leftovers to take home. We will continue to frequent Ace. 


Had a yen for good Chinese food.  We like the flavor of black beans so we ordered the squid with black bean and chicken with double mushrooms.  Service is quick and the plates were full.  Both dishes are highly recommended for their flavor.  Slight increase of prices on dishes but still resealable. 
 




Back to ACE.   It's a crowded Friday eve, a good sign.  Ordered Chicken with garlic sauce and Squid with Black bean sauce. The orders came out quickly.  I was somewhat disappointed with the chicken dish. I had to search for the chicken. It was mostly vegetables. The flavor was still good though with a slightly tart sour taste.  The squid dish was delicious as usual. Tender squid with good flavor.


We took my hubby's brother and wife to dinner.  Staff recognized us and seated us at a large table.  We decided on Chinese greens with garlic, 5 spice squid, black bean chicken and Kung pao shrimp.  Fast service as always.  Great food!  Our guests were impressed.  The plates of food are large and we managed to finish all but one serving of food.  Everyone was full and happy.  Plenty of parking in this rather empty mall.  

Back again.  We visit at least once a month.  Staff recognize us and chat w/me in Cantonese.  She knows we like the taste of their black bean sauce.  Our order was not surprising to them.  Black bean chicken and black bean shrimp.  Fast service as always.  Lots of shrimp in the dish.  We're are always happy with our order and will keep coming back.  We have threatened to try the other places in close vicinity but know we have a winner here."}
{"text":"This is my single favorite Asian restaurant in Arizona at this point in time. I have been coming here for years and it is amazing how they can make such delicious food at the prices they do. They put all other asian restaurants to shame IMO. 

But, the best part of this restaurant is that not only do you get great food. But, you can feed a family of 5 for 25 dollars. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your ACE experience.

Here is how you ACE.

1. Invite your friends(The more people the cheaper the bill when split)
2. Order the family dinner for 3-4 people or special family dinner for 5-8
3. Substitute the white rice for egg-fried rice for a dollar more(That way you get a large portion of fried rice and a large portion of lo-mein to share.
4. Choose your entrees-Everything is good, so order what you like, but, their menu can be a little intimidating. Some recommendations I would give for first timers would be:

Orange Chicken
Twice Cooked Pork
Salt & Pepper Squid
Mongolian Beef
Yin & Yang Fried Rice
Black Bean Squid
Vegetable Curry-Feel Free to add meat of your choice
Kung Pao Shrimp

5. Enjoy delicious food
6. Split the bill
7. Laugh at the fact that you just had some of the best asian food ever for a mere 5-7 dollars"}
{"text":"Price 5/5 - crazy cheap food here, and the quality does not suffer. Spend 30$ for 2 full entries, 2 appetizers, 1 small bowl (think panda bowl), and 1 drink. That includes a 20% tip.

Service 4/5 - The workers here were running around. Food came out very very quick (like... do they have the meat precooked in the back or something?), and other than feeling a bit rushed to initially order, service was top notch. 

Food 4/5 - Food was not bad, but wasn't the best I have had. For the price you are paying, the food is more than enough, and very tasty. However, if you have had real chinese food (China King comes to mind), you will be a bit disappointed.

If you are in the area, and want some cheap food later at night, then Asian Cafe express is your place."}
{"text":"I'm no cheap scape, but I know value when I see it. Here is our order: 

1) Chili Sauce Chicken Dumplings
2) Hot and Sour Soup(Huge Bowl)
3)Pork Egg Rolls
4) The General's Chicken Entree(With Fried Rice)
5) Kung Pao Chicken(With Fried Rice)
6) Boba Milk Tea
7) Sprite

The total cost? Twenty-six dollars. Ridiculous. To make things better, everything was delicious, and the server was very friendly and helpful. My only regret is I didn't order off of the Tokyo Style part of the menu, but there will be another opportunity for that. With such cheap prices and great service, this place is true hidden gem."}
{"text":"Second time here and I am still utterly impressed. Hands down one of,  if not the best version of chicken wings (not sauced) I've ever had. Maybe the smoked wings at Juke Joint in ATL but that ain't that close anymore. I had something other than the wings today and it was good not great. The positive is that their meats are not cheap and thin. The sauces are made in house and very good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! It's in an older ran down plaza but the food makes up for everything else!  We got the 5 dishes for 39.99 and it comes with fried rice, chow mein, white rice, and 5 entries.  I was very impressed with the portion of the dishes and the taste was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Don't let appearances fool you, this place tastes great. While it looks (and is) pretty dirty and the inside of the restaurant hasn't been that well up-kept. The food far outweighs any of those issues. I would ate the food 4-5 stars and would give this review 5 stars if the restaurant itself was cleaner."}
{"text":"cheap and authentic chinese food. best in the area."}
{"text":"I usually order catering from here at least twice a month, and every time placing the order is a hassle.  This time the total was different than usual and the woman started screaming at me about the price when I was just trying to ensure that she had the correct amount of trays.  Good luck when placing an order over the phone!"}
{"text":"My family is from Taiwan, and we visit our relatives every few years or so.  This place reminds me so much of Taiwan -- it's as authentic as it gets, people.  Even the restaurant is kind of grungy, which is exactly how most of those less expensive restaurants (but the most delicious, of course) are in Taiwan.  It's a hole in the wall that focuses on their flavors.  This place is perfect.  Every time my family visits me in Phoenix, we carryout from here.

You know this place is good because so many Asia-natives come here for food -- oftentimes, you hear more Chinese spoken from the tables than English.

Now, the service isn't superb.  It's actually kind of slow, but that's because they're always packed and so busy.  This is not five-star service.  If you're expecting five-star service, you may be better off dining somewhere else.

With that said, the food is spectacular.  My personal favorite is the stir-fried eggplant -- it's cooked with pork into this salty, sour mixture, and it's just mouth-wateringly good.  Their pan-fried noodles are delicious, as well, and I recommend any of their green vegetables, too.  Their XO beef is a favorite of the family.

The prices are phenomenal.  You can feed my six-member family almost two meals or so for about $50.  Their family deals can't be beat, so if you're catering for a family dinner or just a stay-at-home night with luxiouriously tasty Asian cuisine, this is the place for you.  If you're going to carryout, however, I recommend you call ahead.

All in all, if you're only interested in Americanized Chinese food, this probably isn't the place for you.  This stuff is authentic and just soulfully delicious.  I would highly recommend this place for its price, food, and overall value."}
{"text":"My husband and I have successfully used Yelp to find excellent restaurants.  This is the first time it has completely missed the mark.  This place is one of the most filthy, disgusting, unsanitary places we have ever eaten.  Don't even get me started on the bathrooms, they are worse than most gas stations I've seen.  We were uncharacteristically ready to walk out the door before our waters even came.  However, we've been to places that weren't the most beautiful to look at but had wowed us with their food so we decided to give it a try.  We were already there and with 4.5 stars averaged with almost 200 reviews it had to be great, right?  Wrong!  We started with pork egg rolls (they were o.k.) and hot and sour soup (yuck).  We then ordered  different entrees including orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and chicken fried rice.  The only thing that wasn't completely nasty was the orange chicken but it certainly wasn't the best I've had.  The rest of the chicken was rubbery and full of fat/tendons.  We brought three other people with us and we were all staring at each other in disgust.  We will NEVER step foot in this place again!  The reviews have to rigged, it's the only explanation."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with most of the menu  (or @ least what I've tried  so far) not the best of service I gotta admit when it picks up but the quality of the cuisine & the value for the buck, this place rules! One suggestion to the owners if they're reading: open another location &/or find a bigger boat  & keep up the good work & I'll keep on coming back"}
{"text":"Maaaaan am I glad I found this place! The food is authentic and delicious. My s/o and I were feeling ravenous, so we ordered a lot. We got the hot and sour soup, preserved egg and shredded pork congee, satay beef, and minced pork and eggplant with garlic sauce. What we did not realize was how big the portions were! We were only able to eat less than half of all of the dishes.

I found the minced pork and eggplant with garlic sauce a little greasy, and I wish it had a little more pork. The congee could have done with more preserved egg, and the satay beef could have been spicier. That being said, those are just personal preferences.

I was incredibly happy with the service as well, and I am definitely coming back again in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it reminds me of one you will find in Chinatown with all authentic items on the menu."}
{"text":"I made a bad decision in food choice and took two bites of it and pushed it to the side. Our waitress first asked me if she wanted them to make me something else, I simply replied \"no, thank you.\" Without mentioning it she just took it off of my check. That earned them five stars. I will be back to try other foods - that night was just poor judgement on my part with my food choice! Love places with good customer service!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall? Yup. Spectacularly good food? You betcha! You know you're in for a good meal when you're one of like 8 white folks in an absolutely packed restaurant full to the brim with Asian folks! Young and old alike! Chicken with black bean sauce was delicious and the chili salt chicken wings were crispy and tasty and only $2 and change for 5 wings! Pretty good service, too. The lady who sat me and took my order was very nice and the young man attending the tables was personable and friendly and spoke very good English. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"It was as good as everyone says!  And sooo inexpensive...appetizers, entrees, and drinks for 3 people...about 30 bones.  Not to mention the mountain of leftovers we brought home."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I begin. This place is personally my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley. The menu selection is HUGE, so for the super indecisive, their menu might pose a challenge. At the front of the menu, it contains American-Chinese menu classics such as Sesame Chicken and Broccoli and Beef, but as you progress to the back of the menu, this is where the menu truly shines. They carry Hong Kong traditional menu items such as Chinese Broccoli, Thousand Year Egg Soup, Hong Kong styled fried rices and noodles, and a bunch of other things as well! The staff is friendly, sometimes a bit slow, but that's usually because they're so busy half the time! I fully recommend this place for anyone that likes Chinese food."}
{"text":"Total hole-in-the-wall, dive Chinese restaurant in a strip mall in Mesa. But it's totally effing awesome!!

Treated my parents here this evening and was so worth it! Yes, there are poorly photographed pics of some of their dishes on the walls. Yes, it's pretty loud and a couple of flies buzzing around. And, yes, every table is packed with toddlers screaming.

But, I promise you that 

1. Will have tasty, authentic dishes
2. Will have an extremely low bill ($32 for three of us w butt-loads of leftovers??)

All I have to say is: this is my new go-to spot for authentic Chinese now. It's worth the long drive from F.Hills to Mesa!"}
{"text":"My sister and I love coming here. They have many traditional Chinese options that make us incredibly homesick. We usually get the dry chow fun and the Peking duck. Two of the men who work here remind us of our father. They are so kind and chatty."}
{"text":"This review is for the Americanized style menu, we were not in the mood to be adventurous. We had crab puffs, chicken egg rolls, spicy chicken, orange chicken, and veggie lo mein. The great thing about this place is you can try so many things because it is cheap cheap cheap! Only $3.98 for a huge bowl, think two meals, of meat and rice. I liked the chicken egg rolls. I could hardly distinguish between the orange chicken and spicy chicken sauces, but the chicken itself was good. White rice cooked properly, also good.  The thing I was most looking forward to was my veggie lo mein. Sadly it was literally drowning in soy. Other than that, well prepared. I ate it cold the next day and it wasn't bad. I would get it again and ask them to go light on the sauce. The staff is super friendly and sweet. The atmosphere is nonexistent. Probably will choose takeout next time. It's a good alternative to my beloved Tott's Asian Diner that is temporarily closed."}
{"text":"Good food. Okay service. I would take out. Beef and broccoli is great. Spicy chicken is also great."}
{"text":"Great placeto eat.  Atmousphere is nothing fancy but the food is awesome. I have visited several times and each time seems better than the last.  Skip the first couple pages of the menu and jump to the back.  The first few pages are the americanized dishes.  The back of the menu has the more authentic Asian dishes.  Dinner sets offer a fantastic value and lots of food.  Great place for family style meal with large group."}
{"text":"This place has great food but the menu is crazy big! It's like 15 pages long.... Other than that the food and prices are very good"}
{"text":"This place has great food! The menu is SO long--you'll spend a good 10 min at least just going through all the pages, and you'd only be skimming. I was with a large group of people, and half the table ordered the family set. 

I ordered the Fujian style noodles that came in a broth--it was delicious! I wolfed it down, as I did the red bean drink. I had never had a red bean drink before--I loved it so much I had to order another one to take home.

Also for take out, I ordered the Amoy noodles, Yang Chow Fried Rice and orange chicken. The fried rice and orange chicken was really good, but the Amoy noodles were lacking the tang I'm used to. I probably won't order the Amoy noodles again, but there are a TON more dishes from the menu that I'll be going back to try at Asian Cafe Express!

The service was also very prompt and nice. The food came out quickly, and the prices were more than reasonable! The portions are also generous. They closed at 9pm, but with our large group we were chatting away til 9:30pm. We didn't realize they were closed! They never rushed us and were very nice! We were taken aback when we walked out and saw the hours of operation, and definitely appreciated how kind they were."}
{"text":"This location has been on my yelp bookmarks for a while. Since I have been driving to work to mesa lately, I decided to give it a try. . I was very disappointed with my order.

 I ordered the  fried squid with steamed white rice. The squid was deep fried and had a strong taste of the grease. It had so much grease; as soon as I took my first bite I had grease left all around me lips. I took 2 more bites and I was done. The steamed rice was so dry to the point that it had obviously been over cooked. 

Since it was my lunch time time , I ordered it to go. Took 15 minutes to get this \"fried calamari\" and as soon as I got it I was on my way back to work. Wish I had the opportunity to take it back and replace it, but how could I ? I was already at work :( 

Idk why the reviews are so high, I'm hoping is because no one only really orders the squid or I'm hoping is because people dine in instead of to go and they get better quality meals. Whatever the case might be, the quality should be served to anyone regardless if the meal is to dine-in or to-go.

 I Lost around $10 but they Lost my interest."}
{"text":"All you Yelpers here in Metro Phoenix ought to be thankful for this gem.  I've had traditional Chinese food in chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere, and I can tell you that Asian Cafe Express is a real stand-out.  No, it's not Cantonese or Sichuan haute cuisine, but I'll take the authentic, traditional Chinese home cooking of this place any day.  Great food at absurdly low prices.  Everything I had was excellent.  In most traditional Chinese restaurants, low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food.  Not here.  What a great place.  I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in.  I was the only non-Asian patron."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp because it had almost 5 stars out of 468 reviews.   Boy oh boy did we make a mistake.   Service was horrible and food very disappointing.   Save ur money and just go to somewhere else.   Never will we come back."}
{"text":"I had just got back from a trip to NYC where I had the most amazing Chinese food ever, in China Town of course! Well I was craving Chinese food sooo bad so I decided to try this place out. It was amazing. Really authentic and way cheap. In fact, my man and I ordered a bunch of different items so we could try them all. Everything was good and we only spent $30.00 and that included drinks plus tip. The leftovers made for a lovely late night snack."}
{"text":"It's difficult to discern where this restaurant falls in terms of its cuisine. Flipping through the menu you can find Taiwanese food, Cantonese food, Shanghainese food,  and a myriad of others. This aside, however, Asian Cafe Express does a spectacular job despite its identity crisis.

The Cantonese food in this restaurant is fantastic. It's been a long time since I've been able to find some great food in the area, but this place knocks the socks off anything I've had. 

The Taiwanese food in this restaurant is sub-par, but still acceptable compared to the other restaurants in the area given the fad of Americanized Chinese food.

Aside from my criticism of the Taiwanese food, this restaurant does a fantastic job both with the food and service. The decor is nonexistent, but I personally do not expect anything spectacular having come from Asia."}
{"text":"Ok so decided to try this place out after reading all the reviews. Its sort of secluded in a empty plaza, a small hole in a wall i think but damn the food was gooooood! The family deal i got was 3 items to choose from and literally u choose any 3 ala carts not the ones they put together and if u want shrimp items its $2 xtra or fish items add $4 xtra. But they have a wide selection of food to choose from ala cart , lunch n dinner specials n some not even on the menu but they can cook it. I ordered the salt n pepper pork chops not on the menu but they cooked it cuz i seen that someone put it up on yelp n i showed them. It was ! The best chinese restaurant i found since i moved to Arizona, far from me like 30 minute drive but damn worth it...small venue so i can see it gettn packed fast but its worth it. The prices r fair n the portions is enough. Service was pretty good also. And if u like picture menus its all over the walls of the restaurant cuz sometimes u just wanna see the food. The fish with balck bean sauce was awesome! We had tons of left overs not like all the other chinese restaurants ive been to in PHX those r weak n portions suk ass. This place is worth trying if u are in the mesa area, and there is a big asian grocery store across the street at another plaza that u can buy asian stuff. I'd recommend this place for sure and I'd deff make a stop if im in mesa area again..outstanding food!! 2 thumbs up from me.."}
{"text":"It was ok Chinese fast food. The price was cheap."}
{"text":"I heard of this place from a friend and finally decided to go to take out. 
First of all, their menus is HUGE. Good thing they have lots of pics on the wall. 

So, I like to order a lot of things when I first visit a place. 
Monday, I ordered Szechuan Spicy Water Boil Fish, Chili Salt Chicken Wings, Peking Pork Rib, Salt & pepper squid and combo chowfun. 

It was so good that I went back on Wednesday and tried the orange chicken bowl and combo fried rice. 


Most asians NEVER order orange chicken when they go eat chinese food. But I dare to try after seeing the picture. 
BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!!!!! Their orange chicken is AMAZING! better than Panda. Also, its only like $4! 

Price, portion, and quality of food is Amazing!"}
{"text":"My go to place for cheap and good traditional Hong Kong food. Service here can be bad when they are a full house. Other than that, when they are able to and have the time to serve you, they are nice and sweet. They try to make conversation and remember their regulars well. My go to orders are the beef stew curry rice plate, ying yang fried rice, salted fish and chicken fried rice, stir fried ho fun with beef stew, and fish fillet with sauce rice plate. I sometimes also order their ying yang drink which is a mix of coffee and milk tea."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THERE!! DO TAKE OUT! The service is horrible. But the food is amazing and cheap! My boyfriend and I made the mistake of eating there, and we were so irritated about the service, but once we got our food it really didn't matter be uses the good was SO good! We had the orange chicken, low mein, and broccoli and beef. The beef was kinda fatty and was not of fan of that. The chicken was really crisp."}
{"text":"Pay attention people, this place is the real deal. I'm in AZ for work and doing my typical thing when traveling and alone for dinner. I tend to look for Chinese take-out to eat in my hotel room. I feel too pathetic to sit in a restaurant all alone eating so would rather work while I eat. 

Found this place with the help of Arizona local on Yelp. I was really not prepared for what I found since as I was driving to it, it seemed to be a largely Hispanic area I was driving through. I was worried I was going to find a place specializing in Chung King Chow Mein or another Westernized equivalent. Much to my surprise, I found a strip mall small restaurant with good parking and a hodge-podge of visual food images on the wall with some really authentic stuff. This, coupled with a fairly busy kitchen and wait staff hustling to chop tofu and serve tea in a dining room that really had no decor but was full of Chinese people and my interest radar went up immediately. Panda Express this is not. 

The first few pages of the menu do have all the standard Western favorites but towards the end, you are rewarded with a \"Hong Kong\" style menu and it has a lot of great stuff on it. Scrambled eggs and Bitter Melon, Chicken Fried Rice with Salted Fish, and great looking seafood dishes too! Upon placing an order, I sat and waited and could hear the kitchen staff yelling things at each other in Chinese (just like in Hong Kong) and knew that things were going to turn out all right. 

This is a great little find with affordable prices and large portions. In addition, the authenticity is awesome for being in the middle of the desert southwest! The staff was very friendly and clearly hard-working. It is now on my list of definite recommendations when in the PHX area!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice but the food was not great! I had read the reviews and expected it to be wonderful. I left unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"They are super friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome....am totally genuine about it. Please return the kindness.  Yummy hot and sour soup hits the spot when you have a cold.  S and P squid is a favorite for a reason. Don't go by decor. Give it a try, especially during the week when less busy."}
{"text":"The food and prices are great!  You get a lot for your money.  I love the AZ bowls.  A lot of delicious food for a cheap price.   I've never had anything bad.  It can be busy and difficult to get a seat.  Also, the service at times is slow and hard to get refills of drinks.  Good place overall."}
{"text":"It's great food - in fact, it's as good as it gets in the middle of the desert!  I went visiting Phoenix the past weekend, and we expected there won't be too many Asian choices.  Stopped at this restaurant - the food is terrific!  We had a stir-fried spicy eggplant rice and the Singaporean noodles.  The \"wok-air\", interpreted as the temperature and the strength of the gas cooking, made the food taste fresh and crisp.  We came from Hong Kong and later stayed at Seattle, so we are picky about Chinese food, and I gave this place a 4 stars!

Interesting side story - the chef was talking in Cantonese with one of the local patron.  He said he's only cooking with olive oil and how healthy it is compared to vegetable oil.  Thought it's worthy to mention for those who are worried about bad greasy Chinese food - this place isn't one of those."}
{"text":"Amazing food!

Their prices are great and the food tastes amazing. They get really busy around dinner time. We went on a weekday (when it was raining) thinking it was going to be slow....Nope! Entire restaurant was packed.

The food took forever to come out - but when it did, it was amazing.

At the end of the meal, the server informed us that unfortunately they only had 1 chef on that night - and they usually have 3! So I will take her word for it being an off night. Love this place!

Oh, and it's self-seating. There's always a few people that stand at the door for 5 minutes - waiting to be seated - so confused. I have no idea why they don't put up a sign!"}
{"text":"tried kung pao chkn, black bean fish fillet, orange chkn and some veggie stirfry... i was very impressed.  the price was reasonable and the food was really good.  definitely revisiting this joint!

\"Piece\" out!"}
{"text":"I am sorry, but this place was pretty terrible. The prices were great and I was really hoping the food would be also, but I was so wrong. 

The place was busy and the menu is packed with great options. I ordered;
Teriyaki Beef
Combo Fried Rice 
Wings
Hawaiian Beef
Pork Eggrolls

Everything was so greasy! The wings were sopped in garlic and butter. The teriyaki beef and Hawaiian Beef tastes like they had the exact same sauce. The eggrolls were fried too long and full of cabbage with little meat. I love Chinese food and with their great prices I had to give them a try, but I ended up buying a bunch of greasy food that my family and I couldn't even eat."}
{"text":"Best place I have had Asian food that I can remember. Cheap prices, big portions, low cost, delicious food. Nothing to complain of here. The place is located in a non descript strip mall. Every seat in the place was occupied. Looks like a dump but the food and service were great. Other restaurants nearby were literally next to empty while this place was packed! Will return fo sho."}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express is a really nice choice if you're looking for a smaller Chinese restaurant. The food is inexpensive and they offer so many different options for singles, couples, and groups. It is small and you seat yourself. The food is delicious and I have to rave about their homemade wontons! They are stuffed with pork and shrimp and they are very fresh tasting!
It was pretty busy for a Monday night, so I am guessing the restaurant has a lot of fans! 

My one complaint is that the waitress originally spoke English to me and Chinese to my friend, but after a few minutes she quit speaking to me entirely and would only ask my friend what I wanted to eat or if she should ask me certain things. Definitely a little uncomfortable since I could have answered for myself, but I got over it."}
{"text":"We have been searching for Chinese food since we moved here eight years ago. We are done searching. There is nothing we have ordered we haven't loved. I especially appreciate the family meal as I get 5 different meat selections including their to die for Hawaiian chicken. I can bring it home and feed my family of 5 for at least 2 days! Try the salted chicken wings, the spicy general chicken, sweet and sour pork, and everything else! The portions are huge. We always have left overs and I love the staff, they are always friendly even when they are so busy there is barely room for them to deliver food to tables."}
{"text":"I've been to China three times now and spent fourteen weeks there in total, so I definitely know what Chinese food should taste like. Asian Cafe Express is the most authentic Chinese food I have found in America. The restaurant itself reminds me of how many restaurants are in China, from the pictures of the dishes on the wall, to the spicy sauce sitting on the table. The dishes seem to mostly represent the styles of Southern China and Hong Kong, which makes sense because most of the staff comes from those regions. 

Even better than the authenticity of the food are the prices. A specialty bowl consisting of a menu item and rice only costs $3.98. That's fantastic considering how satisfying the meal is. 

If you want to taste authentic Chinese food without having to pay for expensive plane tickets, check out Asian Cafe Express. And if you can take the heat, order the Kung Pao Chicken!"}
{"text":"I had my first visit to ACE yesterday (1:30 pm'ish) and here are my thoughts. The ladies which run it are extremely nice and quite efficient.

The egg rolls and the dipping sauce didn't have much flavor, but we're still decent.

The Kung Pao Shrimp with peanuts on top was phenomenal. Lots of veggies, plenty of sauce, and a good amount of shrimp. 

The salt and pepper fried squid had an unusual smell to it. I am not sure if it was old oil, or just the seasoning they use. For the amount you receive (tons) the price is extremely fair. I was torn on this one because it kept pulling me back in for more, but still had an unusual smell to it.

The orange chicken was lightly breaded and had a mild flavor to it. Not much sauce on it. Average for orange chicken as it goes. I still think Lotus Garden in Apache Junction is the best for orange chicken.

The rice was on the clumpy and very slightly dry side. Not so far that it couldn't be salvaged with a little sauce. Not sticky and clumpy, dry and clumpy. Unusual considering I rarely ever come across that in a Chinese restaurant. Even more so considering how busy this place is and the turnover on rice should be super fast.

The seating is, anywhere you choose to sit. They have a good amount of tables. They have pictures on the wall of all of their dishes. Not stock pictures, but of the actual dish They made. They have a self serve condiments area you can use to get any extra you may want without the need to wait until someone is available to ask for it. I do like this because if I am in a hurry I like to get things myself.

I tried the taro coconut tapioca drink. It was perfectly sweet. If you do not like pulp type items (or tapioca beads) in your drinks you will not like this at all. I don't mind it at all. The straw was extra wide and was easily able to accommodate the pulp and beads in the drink.

All in all I still give it 4 stars. I know that the variety of dishes they offer is awesome. I am eager to try some I haven't come across before at Americanized Chinese restaurants. I will be back for sure.

Update: Having now tried 14 or so different dishes I have to revise down to a 3-1/2 stars. Great variety. But average in taste for most dishes."}
{"text":"Ok. After communicating with management and cleared the air, I've returned to the restaurant and only order to go. We will slowly get re accustomed to their service. 
The food is still fantastic. 
Will return again."}
{"text":"Can't beat how consistently delicious this place is.  They are no frills good Chinese food.  Our favorites are the kung poa and egg and tomato ( trust me).  8 years as customers and we will keep coming!"}
{"text":"very nasty i would never recommend that to anyone food was heated up not fresh at all"}
{"text":"I love this place. the quality, quantity and prices are hard to beat.  The food is authentic chinese, if you cant tell, look at their patrons and you'll know.  The quantity they give you is very generous, def made to share. and their prices are the cheapest in town, without cutting into quality.  I have tried many of their dishes and have enjoy most of them.  If you're new to chinese food, just look at their pics on yelp and order from there. thats the easiest way.

My only complaint is the food is a lil greasy.  Especially their stir friend stuff, its not an alarming amount, but it isnt the most healthiest amount.  But over all this place is great, and the service is fast too.  all my togo orders take less than 10 mins to get

Pro:
-cheap prices
-generous portions
-authentic 
-taste greeeeeeeeeeat
-fast service

Cons
-greasy food
-ran down looking store."}

3.5 stars.

Delicious!  The menu is quite extensive, and if you cannot find what you're craving for, ask for it anyway, as the kitchen will try to accommodate you!  I asked if one is still able to bring in raw food from the market to be prepared here, and I was told yes- good to know!  Very friendly service, but I must admit I was there w/ friends related to the owners.  

Clean atmosphere and very bright inside.  The tables are a bit too close to each other, I thought, but nothing that can't be adjusted if one asked the management, I'm sure.

On my next visit, I will have to remember to ask about omitting cornstarch as I did break out due to food allergies.  To those w/ MSG (monosodium glutamate) allergy, no worries here as the kitchen does not use it.  

BTW, I couldn't find what I had cravings for (crispy Mongolian beef over noodles) on the menu, but after speaking w/ the matron of the house, Mrs. Leung, I was able to eat something close to it.  I did find the dish a little too salty, but it was still good.  I liked the crispiness of the noodles, as well; However, the leftover noodles didn't reheat well.  I suggest to eat your fill at the resto, or share w/ friends (which I did, but I still had some leftover)...  

Hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I have a strict \"no spending money in Mesa\" policy and for years I have lived by it. But I heard great and marvelous reviews about Asian Cafe Express and reluctantly broke my policy.
I'll tell you what, I'd break my longstanding policy again because this place rocked my world. 
Yes, it's a hole in the wall from the outside (and a little bit on the inside) but I've been around long enough to know that those places are usually the best. 
This Hong Kong style Chinese food was hella cheap and totally delicious. I tried the orange chicken bowl (which was less than 4 bucks and freakin' enormous.) Plus some appetizers. I don't recall the names (sorry) but the bottom line is I tried a lot of stuff and all of it was divine. 
Finally, a Chinese restaurant I can be excited about, even if it is in that crap hole of a town called Mesa."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, if you're wishy-washy, brace yourself! There are hoards to decipher and adventurous menu in this restaurant by all accounts. 
I come here often when I don't feel like cooking. Why? The dishes are home-style and luscious.  Sure it's not the fanciest place to take someone on a date. As a matter of fact, it is a hole in a wall, but they sure have one of the best Chinese gastronomy in town. 
There's no shortage of vegetarian dishes, and  any of the meat cuisine can pretty much be replaced with Tofu. 
Everything, I order here, was delectable and utterly packed with bits, there was no scrimping on the meat substitute.  If you are a pescetarian, there is a lot of fishy edibles in the menu at reasonable prices too! 
My carnivorous friends have also assured me that the meat menu is equally amazing.  Be prepared to take home your leftovers, they serve a lot of food.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Was a nice authentic Chinese restaurant. Went for lunch and got busy really quick. Was a little confused because they don't seat us. You just sit down and then theyll give you water and menu. Price is good especially with the portion they give  you. People there are fairly nice."}
{"text":"It is good for a more authentic Asian food. The place is well-lit, clean, and have very unique choices since the chef likes to create new dishes.

If you decide to come here, please order something different than the normal Panda Express' orange chicken or kung pao chicken. Give it a try!
Their stir fried chow fun (rice noodle) is good, the boys tend to Really enjoy hunan beef. They also have this specialty fried rice topped with dry fish flakes.

For drinks, we always order 1/2 tea 1/2 coffee concoction, and tapioca taro drink.

It's very cheap and orders come in huge portion."}
{"text":"When it comes to good ol' Chinese food it's difficult to go anywhere else but here. The place isn't fancy but it does give that vibe of family owned and old fashioned asian diner.

Their menu is huge so we can always order something different. Their crab puffs are the best and the Chili Sauce Dumpling are absolutely delicious. Our other favorite appetizers are the fried shrimp, chili salt chicken wings, and chili salt spare ribs. You won't be disappointed!

I think my favorite entrees would be their orange chicken (of course!), but there general chicken is also really good if you like spicy. We don't order their beef dishes much, but their seafood dishes are pretty good. I would recommend the shrimp in lobster sauce. I think all of their fried rice is good.

The most important thing about Asian Cafe Express is that they are affordable for lunch or dinner. Their lunch bowls only run about $4.15 without tax, appetizers are between $2-$5, and entrees are no more than $8. They even offer dinner specials if you want to order multiple entrees!

Oh, they also have boba milk tea... Yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese food restaurants that I've been to. It's cheap, delicious and give you nice portions. I've been here several times and tried several of their dishes like their fried rice, black pepper chicken which is really flavorful. I recently tried their bean drink which I was amazed at how good it was. (I am adventurous with food, so this drink may not be of everyone's liking)"}
{"text":"This is awesome! Gotta love the food here and the service. Have to try the general chicken with egg fried rice. Definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good portions, decent authentic Chinese food.  Highly recommend!  This little hole-in-the-wall has a very extensive menu spanning several different regional cuisines of China.  If you have a hard time deciding between the many different options, there are several different combination meals that will feed an army for a very good price.  We were in a spicy mood, so we ordered the Spicy Set Meal ($34.99), which included a large bowl of Tom Yum soup, 4 meat dishes (Satay pork, XO beef, water boiled fish, Szechuan chicken), and deep fried tofu in spicy oil.  Out of all the dishes, my favorite was the XO beef, which had a nice deep flavor with very tender beef.  The other meats were also very tender, and were actually not too spicy compared to the Tom Yum soup.  While the meat and the tofu was nicely cooked, the flavors of the dishes in general were just OK.   We finished all of our sizable bowl of soup, and attempted to eat our massive array of dishes, to find that even after eating as much as we could, it looked like we didn't even make a dent in any of the entrees! (A testament to the amount of food they give you in the combination meal)

Service was very prompt, and very friendly.  I'll definitely be coming back to try more of their dishes, especially the Hong Kong/Cantonese style dishes vs. the Szechuan and other spicy style dishes I had this time."}
{"text":"3 attempts to place a carryout order over the phone.  Finally ended up at What-a-Burger.  Why don't they hire someone who speaks engrish?"}
{"text":"far drive from my house but this place is pretty good! there's SO MANY OPTIONS on the menu so your family is bound to enjoy something. orange chicken isn't too great, but it's alright. other than that, we always order the dry beef chow fun every time then switch it up with xo spaghetti chicken noodles and wet seafood hoisin (can't spell it!) chow fun. it's so good! super friendly staff, always see them talking to regulars constantly. it's super busy on saturdays around 5-7 and there's really no waiting spot so you may need to stand outside (mosquitos though haha) so either come earlier or later. love this place and the staff! i recommend coming here if you're unsure what asian food to eat bc they have a lot of choices!"}
{"text":"The food there is amazing!!!! And the prices are soooooo cheap. Fast service, in and out in 20minutes"}
{"text":"I wanted to give a 4 stars for the long wait. But the food changed my mind. By far the best and the cheapest HK food I have in mesa and phoenix area. If you are from hk , you would definitely like the food here. They have a lot of variety and they are authentic."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Good food and even better prices. They have $3.98 rice bowls which are full of quantity AND quality; one of which you'd have to sacrifice elsewhere. I love ordering from here."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the scrubby outside!  Watch the people file in, couples and groups and locals, and you'll want to know WHY?!  Because the menu is huge and the food is legit. Hot and delicious and full of flavor.  Very efficient little operation and easy to see why everyone is a \"regular.\"   It's 2pm on Friday and every table is taken.  That's impressive!!"}
{"text":"I had the king pao chicken and it was great! The orange chicken was ok. But I would come back if I lived in this area."}
{"text":"I started eating here several weeks ago and it's the combination of value, flavors and service which make ACE a place that draws people back.  They do an enormous take-out volume all night because the cooks are good and the prices decent.  As usual, I'll stop in tonight I suppose, although I want to branch out and try different things.  I've had their general chicken, their potstickers, their lo mein in various forms, and their Singapore noodles, but I'm going to mix it up next time.  Tip those kind servers!"}
{"text":"Oh my, this place is busy! We came later in the evening on a Thursday night and the restaurant was packed - always a good sign though. It took about ten minutes to get a table, but it took almost double that time to get a server's attention just so we could order. It was infuriating. We were told they were short-staffed, but it was hard to be empathetic when everything was so inefficient. When we were finally bought water, our server asked if we were ready to order and we were, so she was about to take our order when she noticed another customer waving her down. She hesitated, then asked if she could just go fill their waters. I stared at her, slightly appalled, and didn't respond. She left anyway and she proceeded to walk around the entire restaurant, refilled water cups (missing some customers), returned to the cashier counter, back to another table, back to the counter, took a sip of her soda, opened the drink fridge, put straws in her apron, and just waddled behind the counter. Oh, she still didn't return to take our order. Before I could get really upset, she sent another server to our table. Thank goodness. This server was very nice and actually seemed happy to be at work.

Spicy Salt Fried Pork Spare Ribs ($4.99): Fried pork spare ribs sautéed with garlic, green onions, special sauce, and chili oil. A bit salty, but otherwise tasty. The batter on the ribs was crunchy and the meat was tender and very flavorful. 

Mapo Tofu with Minced Pork ($5.50): The flavor was different than what I'm used to or prefer, however, it was still really good. Nice kick of spice and the tofu was silky. Delicious with white rice.

Yang Chow Fried Rice ($7.75): This style of fried rice is the most similar to the Chinese-style fried rice in Hawaii. It wasn't overly salty and the rice was good. The ham was a little odd though. I would have liked char siu with the shrimp, peas, carrots, and egg.

Chow Fun with Pork ($7.75): The noodles were really good - perfectly chewy and worked well with the thinly-sliced pork, bok choy, and light sauce. Great flavor and seasoned well. We all really loved this dish.

Beef and Bok Choy ($7.75): This was supposed to be beef with Chinese broccoli, but they ran out (sad). The beef was very tender and the bok choy was cooked perfectly. The sauce was also very flavorful. Besides being slightly salty, it was a great dish!

Once we were fed, we were all in much better moods and momentarily forgot the the bad service in the beginning. Also, the service wasn't so terrible for the remainder of our meal. Not that we saw any of the servers often, but when we really needed water or rice, we were able to get their attention quickly. They also insisted on packing our leftovers for us which was nice. Overall, service was okay; rocky start, but finished strong. The prices are crazy cheap, especially for the quality! We were floored that our meal was under $40 (pre-tip). The five dishes filled us up and we had enough leftovers for three more meals! Bottom line is that if I lived in the area, I'd definitely stop by for my Chinese food fix. Also, if the restaurant is packed, maybe order take out."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years for lunch. Always good and timely. If you get here after noon, it WILL be busy. Enough said."}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express is a tucked away gem in Mesa. It's quality food every time. We usually get take out and it's always got a good crowd (which is a good thing).  Service is excellent and the staff are always polite and friendly. 

I tried the red bean tea for the first time today. It was excellent. Perfect summer drink. I'll get it again. Also my go to is the twice cooked pork. It's excellent. I usually get it extra spicy took. 

I've tried numerous dishes and they're all excellent (the only one that i didn't dig really was xo sauce tofu). 

Love Asian cafe express it's my take out Chinese food go-to."}
{"text":"Visited July 2015:  \"Affordable prices for incredible food\"

This restaurant is located in an empty shopping plaza, so the location would make anyone wary. Don't hesitate. The staff is friendly and eager to assist in your dining experience. The place has round tables, and wooden booths. There's pictures of their dishes through out the walls, along with a small TV up in the corner. The menu is vast, so do take your time pursuing it. We got the family style meal with 3 main entrees that included rice and vegetable lo mein for $35.00, They do not have fountain drinks, so be prepared to pay for an extra refill on soda. There is take away, but I firmly believe you get more food dining there then in the carry out. It is between light rail stops and near Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"Short story:
Looking for a cheap lunch that's just OK? Come eat here. 

Long story:
Ambiance: typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant reminiscent of the type Chinese restaurant that you would find all over New York City.

Service: excellent!! The servers and waitresses were always walking ensuring that my drink was full, and making sure that all my dining needs were met.

Food: I ordered pork eggrolls, hot and spicy bowl of soup, and the house special lo mein. All of the foods came out piping hot, and looked beautiful. However, all the dishes lacked the flavor and spice i usually associate with Chinese and szcehchuan  style cooking. The eggrolls, although crispy, lacked the pork flavor that I was looking for. The soup was hot and had plenty of high-quality ingredients, but it was not particularly sour and hot testing. The lo mein had plenty of chicken, beef, and shrimp. It also had that smoky panseared flavor that is characteristic of a good tasting lo mein, however, it was still somewhat bland.

Cost: two pork eggrolls, huge bowl of hot and sour soup, and whole plate of house special lo mein came to a total of $11.50!

Verdict: Asian café express is a great place to go if you want a quick cheap lunch; however it is not particularly the most flavorful Chinese food I've had. I'll come back and try something else before I cast my final judgment or recommendation."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in AZ HANDS DOWN. Delicious authentic food coupled with average service. I'll keep comin' back fo sho!!"}
{"text":"This place is always poppin! My boyfriend and I are obsessed with this place (: we come here at least once a week! The staff is always so friendly to us and the food is definitely underpriced!! The coffee milk tea is fantastic! I definitely recommend this place (despite all the bad reviews) easy fast amazing Chinese food (:  the general chicken and the Orange chicken is super awesome. The Lo Mein is the way to go!!"}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D
Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the best take-out Chinese food in the East Valley. Great prices, enormous portions, reheats well--this place has the works.

My favorite dishes are the dry veggie Chow Fun and the Kung Pao. When I eat in, however, I usually don't go for these dishes. You see--there are two menus here, the AZ Menu and the Traditional Menu. The AZ menu is basically like every other take-out place, it has your General Tso's chicken, Mongolian, Kung Pao, Orange Chicken, etc. That stuff is great for take-out. The traditional menu is HUUUUUGGEEEE and CONFUSSSSSSINGGGG but once you figure it out, there is so much incredible stuff on there. The stuff I ordered off this menu wouldn't have done well as take-out, but I'm sure there is stuff that does well as take-out off this more traditional menu.

My suggestion is when you are craving Panda Express, remember Asian Cafe Express and order take-out from here instead off the AZ Menu (don't forget some Powerade). If you're trying to sit down and eat some good Chinese food, pick up a traditional menu, roll some dice and choose something that sounds even remotely appetizing. Then, enjoy. This menu is where the good stuff is at. Plus, the dining room is filled with Asian people so that has to be a good sign (seriously). There are pictures up on the wall if you need an idea of what things look like."}
{"text":"Very good! Deffinetly see my family visiting this place again in the future! Great service great food! Cant get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials! Many choices with rice, $3.98! If you want REAL, AUTHENTIC Chinese food with ample portions and low prices, look no further!"}
{"text":"This is another spot I ended up visiting with colleagues for a work lunch, having been much hyped before hand. There's really only two ways things can end up after that, either blown away or totally underwhelmed, at least in my experience. Long story short, it was the former. 

While the place is small, unpretentious and definitely has a somewhat \"vintage\" look to it (or \"dated\", depending on whether or not you're the half-full or half-empty type), you can tell right away by the number of occupied tables and the continuous stream of people picking up take-out orders that this place is legit. A little further reading of the crowd will tell you that many of the people in there are regulars, based on their interaction with the staff, and that's typically a good sign. 

The menu here is diverse, to the extreme, and you get a weighty tome handed to you when seated. There aren't many pictures in the menu, but they are literally dozens of them lining the walls of the restaurant, showcasing many of the dishes larger than life and in all their delicious glory. I was a bit overwhelmed by the massive menu, but if you find yourself in the same boat, take a look around at the walls for some of the more popular items. This is where I landed on my choice, their Yin and Yang fried rice dish, which comes with chicken in a tomato sauce and shrimp in a cream sauce. 

The dish was excellent and perfectly cooked, and looked surprisingly close to the stock photo on the wall. It's actually quite a bit of food and the dish is deeper than it looks in the picture, so if you go this route, you'd best be hungry. 

We did also sample a few of the appetizers on our visit, including the egg rolls, dumplings and crab puffs. All of it was fantastic and we actually wanted for more, despite the fact that we originally thought we'd ordered too much. It was that good!

I will admit the service pace was a bit below my expectation, but given how busy they were and the apparently small number of servers available to work the room, I can only really ding them one star for that, and I'd probably only do half if I could. 

Overall, really great tasting, authentic Hong Kong style food in a small, no-frills, authentic setting that makes for a great lunch spot. It's too bad it's so far away from mainstream Phoenix, but it's definitely worth the drive if you're within reach. I will definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"ordered a kong pao chicken, tastes awfully sour, nothing like authentic szechuan food. I ordered a large, tried hard to eat as much as possible to show politeness, failed."}
{"text":"I recommend this place for seafood. I ordered a seafood lunch with Brown rice, mussels, squid, crab cake & shrimp and was satisfied. The waitresses were friendly, knew what to recommend and the food was good. Will go again."}
{"text":"In really surprised I have left a review of this place sooner! I honestly thought I had. I guess when I get here I know that the food will be great! This is the place for great Asian food (in my opinion is the best srsly) and the prices are very reasonable. VERY. So if you're on a budget this is your place. This is not the place if you're in a hurry or wanting a nice and modern atmosphere. This place is authentic and because of that it's busy. REALLY busy. The decor is somewhat 'Sandford and Son meets Jackie Chan' I mean that in the nicest way possible lol. The people are friendly and the customers usually understand the wait times. I love this place, srsly. I highly recommend. 

*The one thing that bothers me is that I wish the restrooms were cleaner. But that's what home is for right?"}

Ordered the curry brisket on rice, pretty good especially with the experience of fries taking place of what should just be potatoes.  Milk tea is a bit expensive but good.  Recommend this place for quick good cheap food."}
{"text":"Food is better than some Chinese places I have had in the area, which isn't saying much because I haven't found a decent chinese place out here yet. My search continues...

I ordered over the phone for pickup. I arrived promptly on time and the place was packed. It appeared five people were working the tables and front cafe with only one person who was manning the register area. There were several people waiting at the counter. One lady was waiting for pick up and it appeared she had been there a while. Finally (after about ten minutes with NO ONE even acknowledging us) she finally asked someone to give her her food. They helped her and moved on while the rest of us are left standing there. After waiting another five minutes I asked a lady to help me out. 

Got my food and headed home, had to reheat my food. I had ordered Mongonlian Beef, Fried Rice and steamed dumplings. Decent food and for a good price (my total meal was under $10 and it was probably enough for two people) but the service was really bad. I shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes to pick up my order. Not sure if I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Asian Café Express is one of the best Chinese restaurant. I have been here a lot. If you look at the menu, there are many pages and a lot different kind of food. You must have heard that the Chinese restaurants here in the U.S are very different from the restaurants in China. The food they have, is very similar to my hometown, Guangzhou, China, which is the south. Their menu also has north, east, south (sweet) and west (spicy) China style food. Very impressed!
If you have some friends want to try out Chinese food, you should bring them here. They have some combos, you can choose different kind of favor. I usually order the one which is Hong Kong style combo. It comes with soup, fried rice, chicken, beef, and fish. A lot of food right? Do you think those cost $50 or above? No, they are like $34 - $38.
If you are looking for a romantic place for a date, that is the wrong place. This restaurant does not have dim lights like P.F. Chang. They are just like a typical Chinese restaurant. They have bright lights so you will be able to see what kind of food you are having. 
Usually they are busy on the weekends. One time I had to wait 20 minutes to get a table. 20 minutes is not that long, because the servers are fast. And they are very friendly. I don't think they are rude at all. They don't have serious faces, unlike other Chinese Servers from other restaurants. They will smile and take your order. Yesterday I got out of class very late and I was very hungry. They close at 9:30 PM and I got there at 9:15 PM. I asked them if I should take to go, they told me to stay! By the time I finished, it was 9:50 PM. They did not give me any attitudes at all the whole time. Even though they told me to slow down and take my time. I was really appreciated. 
Overall, I really like this restaurant, and I recommend you guys to go there. Like I said earlier, they have many different kind of Chinese food. You should invite your friends to go with you and order a combo, so that way you can try different favors. One of the best Chinese food restaurant in town! Worth to try it out."}
{"text":"Environment: Good size restaurant. Have about 12 booths with 9-10 tables. Parking is convenient.

Price: The prices at this place is probably the lowest i have seen in Arizona. Everything was priced reasonably. We ordered 3 dishes and 2 appetizers and total price was about $30. 

Food: I was born and raised in Hong Kong. Since I moved to America, I've been searching for the real Chinese food. If you're interested in real Chinese food, this is the place to go. If you do go, please do not order those fake Chinese food like orange chicken. Kindly ask the waitresses and they would gladly give you some suggestions. You can also look at the wall for the food with pictures if you don't know what you are order. 

Service: The waitresses were very nice. They were short-handed when we got in but the service was great nonetheless. They were checking up on us every 5-10 min. 

Overall: This place is my go-to spot for some really good Chinese food. This is located in Mesa and I live in Avondale. This should describe how good the food is at this place. If you give this a try, you won't regard the quality of the food from this place."}
{"text":"Last week we tried this place out. We did take out since it was later in the evening and the place was packed. The prices are very good. We ordered the egg fried rice, chicken fried rice, vegtable low mein, the mongolian beef, an order of egg rolls and crab puffs and it came to $26 and some change. 

They had the food ready in about 15 minutes and that was with 3 orders ahead of ours! The food was ok. Lacked in flavor on everything but it wasn't bad. I just put on some more salt and I was good. The beef was more onions then beef but my husband said it wasn't too bad. The fried rice was pretty good, just needed some more added salt.

I love boboa so when I saw they had it I was excited but they don't have any flavors of tea. Just a milk tea that to me tastes like coffee. Good but not what I wanted. 

All in all if we are in that part of town and wanting some chinese food we might stop in again. Worth a try though!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Excellent authentic Chinese food, quick and friendly service and just about as cheap as it is possible for a restaurant to be.

We ate there on a Friday night.  It was busy but we got menus within 30 seconds and our food arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered it.

We had the spicy chicken wings (really salt and pepper chicken wings) which were fantastic and the the spicy dumplings to start.  Excellent.

For mains, we had a spicy shrimp dish and the eggplant spareribs, both delicious.

Our waiter checked back in with us four or five times to  refill our water, ask us if we wanted anything else, etc.  The staff is very friendly here.

As others have pointed out here, it's a Hong Kong style diner, meaning a kind of cheap, no-frills, \"let's grab some food on the way home\" kind of place with Cantonese comfort food (joke, chow fun, rice bowls) and Chinese interpretations of western dishes.

If this place were near my office, I'd have lunch here everyday.  Alas, it is not.  

It's also just crazy cheap.  Appetizers run $2.21 and the entrees all top out at $7.72 with a generous selection of one-dish meals at a flat five bucks.  Hard to beat that."}
{"text":"Service is slow but the food is super cheap and VERY authentic. Pro tip: order to go and come in and eat it otherwise you'll wait awhile. Still worth it. Bowls for $4 appetizers $2 and huge plates for $6 including rice"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The drinks are a bit overpriced, but everything else is pretty cheap. Places like this make me wish you could give them 6 stars. Best affordable Chinese place around."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite low-key Asian food place. While everything ends up being delicious, I am partial to their chili dumplings. I could eat them all day."}
{"text":"This is the place to get your traditional asian comfort food, like the stuff your momma makes. Sure they have the typical American-Chinese food like orange chicken, but the have the classics like the suckling roast pork and beef stew. The prices are good and the portions are huge and one dish can easily be for two meals. For people who really want to try what Chinese people eat at home, come with a bunch of friends and order some traditional dishes \"family style.\""}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Asian cuisine. They have two menu. Hongkong and regular. The food was so flavorous."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and reasonable prices! The Mongolian beef and Hawaiian BBQ chicken are definitely worth a try! Just wish it was closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! 

I came with 2 friends, and it was packed. We didn't manage to snag a table until a little later but it was worth it. We ordered the northern set dinner and a plate of boiled dumplings. 

The dumplings were good but the skin was broken and falling apart, so they were boiled for too long. The flavor was there but it was overcooked. The northern set had egg soup, chicken, pork, shrimp, eggplant and garlic veges. Overall, everything was tasty and came out hot and fresh. The soup was good but a little generic, the spicy chicken was very good and so was the garlic veges. I love the eggplant and that is one of the reasons I wanted to order the Northern set but the pork that it came with was a little weird. The pork with the eggplant tasted either dry or overcooked and it was very tough. Both the chicken and shrimp dishes were good as well. Overall, everything was good and the food came out pretty fast. And the Asian Cafe Express was pretty authentic as well. 

Overall, its a pretty good Chinese restaurant with decent prices. The menu was pretty long, so I highly recommend choosing a set meal because it does get a little overwhelming."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is delicious! If I want Asian food this is where I go. They have an authentic Chinese menu and the \"American Chinese\" menu (AZ Style). The prices are dirt cheap, the service is great, and the portions are huge! Always have leftovers!"}
{"text":"To preface: I was born in Hong Kong and go back every three years to eat my way around the city. Asian Cafe Express, despite its very Amercanized name, is as close to authentic as I can ask for in Phoenix. Just to check, I ordered something that only an HKer would love and know (and order): beef innards with ho fan. I'm not even sure if it's offered on the menu under one of their HK-style noodle dishes, because once I found out the staff spoke Chinese, I ordered it in Chinese. The tripe/intestines were braised in the authentic way and definitely tasted authentic; the broth came with both chives and scallions, which is also pretty authentic. I do find their selection of noodles limited as I wanted silver-needle noodles, but I understand that might be too much to ask of a place that's not even in a proper Chinatown setting. For $5.10, I got a giant bowl of noodles that I couldn't even finish. I'll definitely go back and try a few other dishes to test this place's authenticity but for now, it gets my thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Wow.

We were looking for Chinese near our house and didn't want the so-so buffet down the street. I had tried this place before, but only for a light snack while my tire was being fixed. It looked intriguing enough that I kept it in the back of my mind for quite a while. Unfortunately, the decor kept me from rushing back (I don't have many adventurous foodie friends).

I should state now that the owners are the former owners of the Gourmet House of Hong Kong -- so I'm sure most of the food here is done in the Hong Kong style. (But I don't know much about Chinese regional cooking).

The other night we decided to check the place out for dinner. I am glad we did.

We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, pepper beef, orange chicken and a chicken rice bowl for the kiddo.

The service was spectacular -- our waitress (one of the owners) brought crackers for our daughter to eat (after dinner we went to the Asian supermarket across the street and bought a box of the crackers) and was otherwise wonderful with us. Some of the best service I've had in a very long time.

Physically, the place is bland. It's not home-y, but it does remind me of hole-in-the-wall faster food places abroad.

The food, on the other hand, is fantastic. Like I said, my food companions are not very adventuresome (chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken). I tried the pepper beef on suggestion by our waitress.

Every single person (including the three-year old) was blown away by the taste of the food. I really can't say much more.

It's very convenient to the Sycamore/Main Light Rail Station -- this should be on every foodie/light-rail rider's menu."}
{"text":"LOVE IT. After our horrible experience yesterday at Szechuan Palace this place was like a breath of fresh air. At work the other day I trained a gal from Hong Kong. After the training I asked her if she had found any good Hong Kong style restaurants and she recommended this place. I'm glad I asked. 

We were greeted at the door and water arrived right away. Super friendly. Excellent, HUGE menu. Here the American and Chinese menus are combined, so there is no need to ask for the \"secret menu.\" 

We ordered two Hong Kong style chow meins, one chicken and one seafood; egg rolls for our son; spicy dumplings, spicy sauce chicken hot pot; and Kung Pao beef for my stepson. Everything was just great. 

This is a little family run strip mall place. Nothing fancy. Nothing pretentious. Just my kind of place--good food, good service, and good prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything I've had I've gotten to go. Every time I show up they already have it ready for me and it's still warm and delicious when I get home. Although sometimes the packaging can get messy they really try their best by double boxing it and putting a small plastic bag around those. A large item can easily turn into 3 full meals, and a regular into 2. The Mongolian chicken is a bit sweet but the fried rice is amazing and the white rice isn't sticky which is how I  prefer it. I would keep coming back if I could."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Asian food in Arizona, this is as good as it gets!

Here's what we got: 
1) Hong Kong Crispy Noodles. Rating: 3.5/5.
2) Schezwan Eggplant. Rating: 3.5/5. It's not the best tasting I've had, but it it is decent. I think they could have placed chili flakes instead of chili oil to make the dish more spicy and tastier. 
3) Mongolian beef. Rating: 4/5. Sweet and addictive. Do they really not add MSG? It's that addicting. It's the dish I liked the most out of the 3 entrees we ordered. 

They've got good service and I'm a fan of local stores. Our meal came out to $24 including tax and tip for three people. Not bad! ~$8/person!"}
{"text":"ACE has been a go to place since college.... Sad to admit, about 10 years ago.  But, that tells you that they have been around for a while and they know what they are doing... for the most part ;) They have a huge menu and can even make things that aren't on the menu, if you ask!  It is pretty reasonably priced and they are good sized portions!  My friend's family was visiting and drove everyday for 30 minutes just to eat here because it was so good and cheap and they don't have good Asian food where they live... haha

The only down side is... sometimes the language barrier (yes, I'm Asian, and I only speak English..) causes my order not to be exactly what I wanted.. But it is still good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Friday night.  The place was packed and there was a waitlist started.  Good thing part of our group was inside already eating and had reserved our seats.  The food was pretty tasty and the portions were big.  My friend I split a chicken bowl.  It filled us both up.  Our friends got other items on the menu and most of us finished our food.  Just by the looks of the crowd, it doesn't look like this place would be a disappointment.  You should try this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Outstanding variety. Yes, it's a dive. But service was friendly, food was fresh and nicely presented. The real deal as far as I'm concerned. Any time a Chinese restaurant has handwritten notes in the window for Chinese speaking customers, I'm in. Had the Double Mushroom Beef and it was amazingly good. Didn't think there was any way I'd finish the huge portion...until it was done. Same for KT meal. Oh, and the spring rolls were as good as I've had anywhere. We'll be back every chance we get."}
{"text":"What a little gem!  I came here with my parents when I stopped in Phoenix to see them...for 21 dollars, you could order 3 dishes and they gave a complimentary dish.  We chose two noodle dishes and two rice dishes...so much variety and flavor amongst the four dishes!   Not bad for a little hole in the wall.  I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! My boyfriend and I just recently discovered this place and have been back twice in two days already!! Portions are huge and very inexpensive! So happy we found this place!!"}
{"text":"Some days all you want is a good bowl of noodles...covered with a great sauce...mixed with flavorful veggies...tossed with tender meat...served piping hot...priced for a college student's wallet. Thankfully this place delivers and delivers and delivers on all fronts. I have yet to have a dish here that didn't instantly become the standard by which I judged all that followed it. The dizzying array of choices range from the American standards to the adventurous surprises and yet I have yet to dine here with anyone (raised on chicken feet to Asian food novice) who didn't go away satisfied.

Service can be slow, but you'll forget the wait by the end of your first mouthful.

Order this now: Black pepper sauce with pork spare ribs chow fun"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese spots that I've been to in the valley. They have a HUGE menu. Which makes it so hard to choose what you want! Portions are huge. Cheap prices. Service is very fast. They have pictures of certain dishes posted all over the walls to help you see the visuals of the dishes. 

Definitely a great place to eat family style. Ordering a few dishes and sharing altogether. Their vegetable fried rice was okay but their vegetable chow fun was extremely good! Can never go wrong with salt & pepper wings. The salt and pepper squid was lightly battered and seasoned perfectly. Everything was amazing! Had so much left overs haha."}
{"text":"A small hole in the wall, hardly even noticeable from outside...but don't let the looks fool you. This is a restaraunt to come to purely for the food, and that will not disappoint you.  Not enough places like this around the valley!"}
{"text":"Asia Cafe is one of the solid chinese places that delivers family style  food for an inexpensive price. They have Hong  Kong style dishes and asian american classics. What's  really great are their  portion sizes where you get the most bang for your buck. 

This is not a fancy pants restaurant  but a family owned restaurant. When they get busy it's  sometimes hard to flag the sister team  down but the food  is always  good. 

We like to order their:

Crispy Salt Pepper Tofu- this always comes steaming hot and they are so addicting!

Orange Chicken- I usually stay  away from this type of food but their's is actually good. Other similar sweet & sour items on menu ( Hong Kong Sweet Sour Spareribs, Peking Spareribs)

Combo Chow Fun or Beef Chow Fun- The combo chow fun  has  bok choy, squid & shrimp we order it with the  light gravy. Wish they put more soy sauce. Beef chow fun is good and has wok hei! That nice noodle char. 

Drinks: Hong Kong Milk Tea & Taro coconut drink. Hong  Kong Milk Tea is always good  has strong flavor red black tea and condensed milk. Taro coconut is my fave here with real taro bits and tapioca!

You'll  see lots of people ordering take out or coming in groups because their family-style portions are great! We love to take visitors here to show warm hospitality. We are definitely regulars!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the valley without breaking the bank! For those people that complained about the wait time they have to consider that everything is made to order. The black pepper chicken is amazing and it took approx. 20 min for my food to arrive. Simple healthy fresh food. The portions are huge if you order the dinner plate for $7 or you can go for the bowl with is $5 ( still plenty of food). Customer service is also on point."}
{"text":"I was insane not to give this place Five Stars. They are a treasure in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Service was fast and food is great! The only problem I have is they use Mexican white rice, not Asian rice. There is a huge difference, its like ordering Burrito wrapped in American bread instead of Tortilla, at least for me. Still they serve some really good Authentic Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"I don't really care what anyone says, this is the best Chinese food place I've ever eaten. The menu has a lot to choose from the portions are huge and the prices are super reasonable. Everything is made to order,the flavors are great. Those who say their food is bland must have some serious lack of taste buds. My only gripe is that their service could be a bit better organized. Update :Don't know if they got new cooks or what but lately nothing has been tasting as good as before. I use to come in almost every weekend. It's been a few months. I hope they figure it out :/ 6.2 went back and this place is back on their game!"}
{"text":"We ordered the family style dinner and it included 5 entrees, lo mein, egg fried rice and steamed rice for $34.99.  The twice cooked pork, sweet and sour pork and orange chicken were all fried and no vegetables.  These dishes were fantastic however, I didn't realize they do not include veggies so that was a major disappointment.  The chicken chow mein with crispy noodles would have been my favorite however, there was a communication problem when ordering.  I wanted it with chicken, celery, onion and bean sprouts only.  The waitress asked if I wanted bok choy and I said \"yes\".  She then said \"no bean sprouts?\"  So I said \"I want the bean sprouts instead of bok choy if I could only choose just one.\"  When the dish came out it was only chicken and bean sprouts.  Total disappointment!  I then realized that she was trying to say they don't have celery but have bok choy instead.  Chow mein is not chow mein without celery.  I loved the flavor of the sauce the chicken was amazing and the crispy noodles were the best I've had in a long time.  The broccoli beef was great.  The beef was flavorful   tender, and it included plenty of broccoli.  I would order it again.  The lo mein was fantastic and the egg fried and steamed  rice were good.  I see why so many people go here because we got soooooo much food for the price and it was overall good and I would definitely go back however I would order something else that wasn't fried and had veggies. If you like fried food and no veggies and get literally a PILE of food and have a PILE of food to take home with you, then this is the place to go.  Do not try to special order here or you may not get what you are asking for."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, delicious, incredibly underpriced and underrated! I bring everyone I know here. The service is so friendly and they always remember you. Just such a solid spot"}
{"text":"OK, they raised the price on the $3.33 bowl to $3.79.  Still a great value!"}
{"text":"Asian Cafe Express shares the same Chinese name as the Cafe de Coral in Hong Kong, and boasts itself as \"Arizona's 1st Hong Kong style cafe serving authentic Chinese, Southeast Asia & Western influenced dishes\". Over 300 dishes are found on the menu, ranging from the classic Hong Kong style baked pork chop rice to the Americanized sweet and sour pork. Even Hawaiian roast pork appears on the menu. Despite offering a wide selection of Chinese dishes, Asian Cafe Express lacks the \"outstanding factor\" since it is a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" restaurant. This type of restaurant serves nearly everything in an ordinary fashion and neglects to specialize in any particular dish.

I came to Asian Cafe Express for a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed. Most of the guests were eating ACE's $3.98 special bowl, a one-item Americanized rice bowl (kung pao chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.). I summoned the Cantonese waiter and ordered a baked pork chop rice. He told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to 1 hour for this dish. LOL, who has that long to eat lunch? In nearly all HK cafes that I have been to, only 10 to 15 minutes is required to deliver this dish to my table even when the kitchen is busy. All the ingredients are generally pre-processed such that the rice just needs to be stir-fried and the ingredients just needs to be baked to melt the cheese before the baked pork chop rice is served. Unfortunately, this preparation is absent at ACE, likely due to its low demand. A 60 minute estimate suggests that the pork chops had not been cut and fried, the vegetables have not been diced, and/or the rice has not been stir-fried or cooked. Basically the dish is cooked from scratch. 

Alternatively, I ordered the Fresh Tomatoes with Two Eggs and Beef since it was guaranteed to be out instantly. It arrived in 20 minutes. This rice plate is considered as a basic and classic HK over-rice dish. It was acceptable, the egg was fried crispy on the corners yet not burnt, an attribute that even some HK cafes in Southern California neglect. The tomatoes gravy was not as salty as I expected and beef were tender and cooked properly. However, my biggest concern was the rice that was used. The rice texture was poor. It resembled a very loose rice pilaf rather than Jasmine rice. Rice pilaf is highly uncharacteristic of what is served at a traditional Hong Kong style cafe.

To complement the rice dish, I also ordered the daily soup - a carrot and Chinese vegetable soup. It was probably the best Cantonese old-fire soup available in Arizona. Unfortunately, the soup was very oily and contained a lot of MSG. It definitely does not pass the home-style quality test.

Finally, I ordered the HK style coffee with milk tea (yin-yeung), to complete the HK-cafe experience. The young waiter informed me that it would take over 30 minutes to prepare, because he had to boil the water and then steep the tea. I received the drink in a soup cup (LOL). I could tell that milk tea and hot beverages are not ordered often enough for the restaurant to order mugs. The yin yeung was prepared with the HK-style procedure, mixing coffee and milk tea in equal proportions, but the milk tea was prepared in an odd way (red tea was mixed with a dash of 2% milk). Overall, the taste was acceptable for Arizona standards. At least better than some places in LA, which give you 75% coffee, 25% English tea, and condensed milk. 

Asian Cafe Express offers authentic Cantonese dishes on their menu but I think some of the proper ingredients are lacking in Arizona, so the dishes cannot be prepared with the same standard as those found in Hong Kong or even Los Angeles. In Arizona, ACE is considered one of the best HK-style restaurants, but in LA, the restaurant would not survive for more than 6 months."}
{"text":"This is no fancy restaurant... more of a hole in the wall kind of place. BUT the food here is awesome! It's quick, inexpensive, and authentic. The staff here are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Lots of entrees to choice from the menu! So many items that it will overwhelm you! 

I've been here twice. The first time I ordered black bean mussels and it comes with a side of rice (all the dishes do) for $9.50 I believe.

The second time I ordered the crispy chicken with gravy smothered over it. I didn't find it on the menu, I showed the waitress the photo and she knew what I was talking about. She told me it is a spicy dish, but I didn't think so. 

I like this place because is it affordable and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as close as you can get to Chinese food in Arizona. It is very affordable too. I usually get the three entrees, vegetable dish and rice for about $25. You can swap the vegetable dish out for a soup. I love their eggplant and spare ribs dish - eggplant is always soft and fill of flavor. Another good dish is the crispy noodle dish. The restaurant is a little dirty and I'm too scared to check out the bathroom, that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There's also free parking outside, which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Really good chinese food.  2 menus - Hong Kong style or AZ chinese (American).  Lots to choose from.  Awesome hot and sour soup, ginger garlic beef noodles and kung pao.  Not spicy but I imagine they didn't know how spicy we could take it.  Chili oil on the table to add heat! Nice touch.   Best we have had in AZ since moving here 6 mos. ago."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Asian places to dine. We've been to many China towns throughout the nation and this place is right up there. Great quality food and very generous portions and excellent prices. VERY deep menu/huge amount of menu choices. If you can't find something you like here, wow!"}
{"text":"This place is totally worth the light rail ride out to Mesa.  It looks a little skeevy inside but damn if the food ain't good.  This is probably the best hole in the wall chinese I've had since I left NYC.  

The orange chicken was killer.  That's really all I ever order when I go to a chinese place.  It helps me compare them.  It still wasn't as good as China Chili's but, for the price, it was amazing.  Speaking of price, the stuff here is like in the $3-$5 range.  It's like 1989 all over again.  

My only complaint is really just the location.  It's an absolute dump inside.  Nothing is clean and I'd be surprised if this place passes health inspection.  Other than that - it's wicked good."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for tasty and cheap Asian food. The menu is huge (about 20 pages) and it's split up by style and origin. So far the hot and sour soup and the orange chicken are my most favorite. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the service. Most of the time you walk in and nobody says a word to you so I've learned to just seat myself. When the waitress finally gets over to your table they are very nice. However, the time it takes for you just to get your food and drinks is a bit too long. It seems to me that it is an understaffing issue. There is usually only 1-2 servers when the place is packed. 

Just a heads up the regular portion size is plenty for me to be full and have lunch leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"This is, by far, our favorite place for Chinese food.  Everything we've gotten here is delicious.  The staff is super nice and hard-working too.  About the only complaint I have is that sometimes they get really busy and the staff seems to have a difficult time keeping up.  It's always worth the wait when it does take awhile though!"}
{"text":"When I crave for shrimp fried rice, Asian Express is the place I would order. Not only that the portion they serve is large, their cooks are all chinese which makes it more authentic."}
{"text":"Well I could have sworn I wrote a review for here before...... I have been  here several times, and I almost always get the sweet and sour chicken rice bowl.... $4.30 after tax and it is enough food for two meals. The rice is great, and there is an abundance of chicken along with veggies. I got the sweet and sour pork once and it wasn't as good,; a bit more dry, and one time I tried the egg rolls and crab puffs and both were amazing. Wish they had a combo that included them like most places do, but it won't break the bank since they're $1.88 for 2. This is my favorite Chinese place I think...."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn authentic, and the prices are stellar. Seriously! You can't beat the lunch special for $4.60 (+ $2 to sub fried rice). I've only dined in once or twice about 6 or so years ago, and gotten to-go a few times recently, but the service has always been decent. There's a bit of a language barrier sometimes, but nothing that can't be worked around.

The sodium level can be out the roof in certain dishes. The lunch special that we always get is good, but they have a huge menu full of other (much more) authentic stuff. HUGE portions too!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Service is slow. People are rude. That being said... It's like any other true chinese restaurant! :) I felt the food was pretty authentic. They didn't stray too far from originals. They had a huge selection so there will be something for everyone there. If you aren't used to bustling restaurants or loud talking or slightly questionable sanitation then I wouldn't come here. 

Overall, food is pretty good just ambiance and service could be improved."}
{"text":"No frills place with ample seating for groups or families. If you want you can order off the wall as they post photos of popular dishes for your ease of ordering. Everyone in our group each ordered a dish or two, and everything was approximately $8.95/ plate. It comes out in huge portions which was excellent, and we all shared with one another. I ordered beef stew on ho fun noodles, combo tofu dish, and my hubby ordered the general tso's chicken. Other people ordered stuff I didn't pay attention to, but it was ALL good. Great seevice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite authentic Chinese restaurant! Lots of food at very reasonable prices! Piping hot, tasty, and great service! Try It!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place in the East Valley that I would eat Chinese Food!  

Suzie and Mike have a helluva way of great service and turn out the best food money can buy!  Great if you are on a budget and even better when you need WonTon for flu!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Satisfied every time. It's affordable and super yummy, with lots to choose from."}
{"text":"The menu selection is big depending on your mood and what region of Asia you want that they have in their menu."}
{"text":"The range of authentic Asian options will impress the adventurous foodie but the lack of seating means that, unless u win the lottery, u will have to order out, or wait a while for a table. Patience is rewarded though! Usually the quality of the food has always been top notch; but like all good restaurants, you need to know what you like or you might end up with a meal unsuited for you. The fried rice is the bomb, and comes in too many varieties for me to list here; including those that you would not find on an Americanized Chinese Food Menu. The only thing that I would say is a draw back is the new egg rolls, the egg rolls were at one time a must have but the new supply is forgettable at best. If you like Chinese food then you must try this place, but I would say to do so before 5pm otherwise you will get caught up in the crowd."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. Traditional Chinese food up to par with what you get in Hong Kong. There's also American Chinese food offered. We always end it with a dessert drink."}
{"text":"I didn't know Chinese food THIS GOOD existed, especially in MESA!

Being a huge fan of Chinese food, I was very excited to try this place after the rave reviews I read on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!  This place serves up the best Chinese food in Arizona, easily..... and for CHEAP.  You would be hard pressed to find a dish over $7.

Do yourself a favor when you get the menu and just skip the first three pages until you start seeing \"Hong Kong Style xxxxxxxx\" and start there.  They have truly authentic Cantonese / Hong Kong style cuisine with dishes I have never seen anywhere else.  

I have had probably 8 different items there so far and each one was AMAZING.   Try something out of the ordinary, you won't be disappointed.  Also, you have to try a Chow Fun dish.  It's a MUST.  I have never tasted Chow Fun as good as they have it.... it's crazy how good their Chow Fun is, no joke.

Two words of caution..... sometimes the English translation of the items is not exactly the same as the Chinese translation... obviously the chef uses the Chinese translation, so do yourself a favor and confirm the choice with the waitress.  For instance, their \"Black Pepper Sauce Chow Fun\" is actually Chow Fun with Black Bean sauce with green peppers.  Not a big deal since everything is excellent, but just so you know.  Second word of caution.... you WILL get addicted to this food!  You have been warned.  :)"}
{"text":"Based on the previous Yelp reviews,  we ventured to this place tonight- who knew it would be so good and so reasonable!  Once we seated ourselves, it was awesome!  
We ordered the family special that comes with 3 plates and a soup. We kept it simple- Orange chicken,  beef n broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken. Each plate was absolutely delicious!  The portion on each plate was enough for 3 people.  We had all our food in 10 minutes and we were politely served lots of water and tea quickly.
This isn't Asian fusion or cuisine.  Not fancy. Just straight up old fashioned Chinese food. Just ask the Chinese who eat there! Don't go if u want fancy or decor. Go for the great food at a great price!

If you don't agree, don't tell me I am wrong.  Just write your own review. Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hong Kong and this is the only place I've found that has authentic Hong Kong/Chinese cuisine. It's delicious, cheap, and very fast!"}
{"text":"Terrific food!  Very tasty and well-prepared. My mom and I ate there today from 2:30 until about 3:30, and we saw a constant stream of people entering the place.  It's no wonder-the food is great, the service is friendly and efficient, the portions are huge, and the prices are fair.  Decor is basically the menu on the wall,  but there are a few decorative items as well. I did notice the floor was not very clean,  but it was the middle of the day,  maybe it started out clean. I didn't care about any of these things,  I was too busy with the food!  Go!  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall spot in a somewhat sketchy area, but definitely worth the stop if you just want some great priced food! You get WAY more food for your money than you would get anywhere else, and it's pretty tasty too. They have tons of options. If you have a large family, then definitely check it out. I've only been with one other person, but they have some killer specials for large parties that make me want to order them just cause they are that good of deals!"}
{"text":"Ok... so I know I only went here a few days ago.... but hey! I'm sick and in need of lots of asian soup. So the BF and I went here tonight to get some cheap foods and it just didn't measure up to last time. We got the chili dumplings and I thought they were just ok.... I couldn't taste the meat over the chili, so I didn't really like that....the pork flavor is the best part! Next time maybe I'll go for regular pork and veg dumplings. The BF, however, really liked the dumplings so to each his own. We also got a spring noodle soup due to its cheapness and simplicity. Well now I know why it is so cheap. First off, I was expecting an individual sized soup... like a cup, cuz it cost 2$, but no... it was a giant bowl! Normally I wouldn't complain, except that the food inside the bowl wasn't very good or flavorful. The noodles were like thick spaghetti.... mushy and flavorless. The broth was also quite bland.... just a bit salty. And that's all there was. So, I know it's probably my fault and a misunderstanding, but I thought even though it said it had no meat and no veg,  it would still have some kind of seasoning. I wish they would serve a really good flavorful broth with more delicate noodles.... still no meat or veg.... for the same price... and just make the portion a normal portion for one person. Anyway, it's not that big a deal, I just wouldn't order that item. We also got the black bean spare ribs which were ok, but not as good as the other day when I tried my friend's spare ribs.... maybe due to them being busy. I think they just put too much black bean sauce on today and it made it kind of salty. Soooo tonight's visit gets an 'ok' but since the other day's visit was so good, I evened them out and went with four stars."}
{"text":"This place was packed on Saturday, and for a good reason! Asian Café Express offers some of the tastiest Chinese food for ridiculously low prices. Four of us ordered the family deal for a little over 20 bucks: three entrées with rice and lo mein. More than enough food! Although a little understaffed, the food is very worth it."}
{"text":"Ok this place is wicked cheap and the food is delicious.  The menu is huge and about 1/2 english. The service is always great... If this place served beer I would eat here every day."}
{"text":"I used to work near this place and I stop in whenever I am in the area.  I get ONE thing!  Black Pepper Spice Chicken with white rice.  Large portion.  I could eat it everyday and damn near did when I worked out there.

This place is very affordable.  It isn't the fanciest sit down place, but that is what helps it stay affordable so it's great.  It has the same ambiance as Filibertos, but who cares?  I love this place!

This is a gem and I miss it often.  Get the Black Pepper Slice Chicken!"}
{"text":"This place serves the cheapest Chinese food and quality is very low.  If you wanted to eat Chinese, Wok Kee is the most important and you should sit right next to the kitchen to have to food prepared.  Not Takeouts-Left over are reserved for pigs.  I have been told that this place is good and always found it to be way too salty.  The female owner wanted to charge me for rice when the food was uneatable and I had to get more rice to wash out the salt in my bitter melon with beef.  I have been there many times and I have decided to never return.  The service was good with exception of the owner's lady.  Many of the food aren't bite size which is a must and it is way too chunky which only poor peasant eat like that.  I am still looking for somewhere that serves sea cucumbers, abalone, and delicacies of the sea.  NOT PEASANT FOOD."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. The pictures on wall looked more appetizing then the food actually was. Food was bland and not flavorful. Nice sized portions, but had to basically season the food ourselves. Ambiance is very 90's, not sure if we had to seat ourselves or be seated. While sitting here eating, I can't help and stare up at the water marks on the ceiling. Oh last thing that kinda threw me off was that the bus boy cleaned food droppings off of the chair with the soy sauce bottle that was on the table. Menu was super busy. Need to minimize their options in order to get their flavor a right."}
{"text":"What can I say... I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I thought I would never ever find a place like this in the Phoenix valley. I was so wrong. I'm from a place highly populated with Asians, Vancouver BC. Therefore I'd like to think I know good Asian food as I grew up on it. This place is up there with the best I've had. Mostly Hong Kong style cafe food. Hands down my favourite fried rice in the world is served here, salted fish and chicken fried rice. It might not be for everyone as the smell is very fishy but it's so delicious! Can't forget about the Hong Kong style milk tea! This place is truly a gem. The prices are great and the food selection is amazing. If I didn't live so far away I'd be way more often."}
{"text":"Almost don't want to leave a review, because they deserve a fabulous one, and if this place gets any busier, I don't know how they'll handle it!

I came here years ago, forgot about it, and assumed they were no longer there. Have had a hard time finding good Chinese food in the valley. Drove around looking for one last night, and found this one again. LUCKY ME!!

It was early in the evening, so we didn't expect the crowd we found when we walked in. This place was packed!

Fortunately, the three waitresses, that were serving the entire place (!) were amazing. And whoever was cooking in the back? Must have had a magic wand....

The food came out super fast. That was a good thing, because I was hungry enough to eat the arm of the person next to me. That was also a good thing, because the portions were HUGE. And the prices were fantastic! We had Mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork, Kung pao shrimp, and sweet and sour soup. Three starving people ate until we were almost bursting, and took home enough for another meal for all three of us.

I couldn't recommend this place more. Bring all your friends! Wait! Don't! Let's keep this place just our secret for now. Love this place , wish I could give 10 stars."}
{"text":"Great taste
Huge amount 
And inexpensive 

I do not think I cam ask more.

But plan ahead, it is quite busy"}
{"text":"I have visited this place so many times and I would never get tired of it. The service is always good coupled with great food."}
{"text":"ACE is THE place to go for delicious Chinese food in the Valley! My father had been eating at Gourmet House since the 80s, and I grew to love it as well, although it was a bit of a drive from where I lived. When he told me the owners sold it and opened their own place in Mesa, closer to my digs, I was pumped. He told me the menu was different, and I became worried that my favorite, Hunan Beef, would not be on the menu. Unfortunately it's not, but I still ask for the Hunan Beef every time, and lucky for me they are happy to oblige. 

The menu is huge, gigantic really, with a whole section on Hong Kong style cuisine. I regretfully have not yet tried as many items on the menu as I would like, since I always want my favorites, but this would definitely be the place to branch out and try something new. Baby bok choy greens with garlic sauce, hot and sour soup, fried rice, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, lo mein, all the classics are delicious! Very inexpensive, including lunch bowl portions of favorite dishes with rice for under $5. My friends who are now in San Francisco curse me every time I send them a photo of the food with their telltale plate design."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Asian restaurant. It's not fancy but the food is awesome. I'm always trying new things and the food is always very flavorful and good portions."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now courtesy of my dad.  I live in LA and we have lots of great Chinese food available to us, so our standards are a bit higher than most.  From the sound of the name,  you wouldn't think much of Asian Cafe Express.  However, they do a very nice job of putting out some authentic Cantonese food.  The taste and flavors of their dishes are not exactly what we have come to like, but everyplace has there variances according to the cook.  Still, both times we have come with 6 or 7 seven people and have ordered enough food for double that.  Both times, the food was very consistent and I have no complaints about anything.  The girls there work hard and are pretty quick considering only 2 of them handle the whole restaurant.  Prices here are very reasonable, even for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I normally don't like Chinese food. In fact, it's just about the only style of food I haven't fallen in love with at some point in my life. This is a real problem when you live with someone that would die for Chinese food at all hours of the day/night. 

I figured out why I never liked Chinese food when I first ate at Asian Cafe Express. It's because everything I've had has been Americanized Chinese Food!!!  It was like an epiphany and seriously music to my tastebuds when I actually found Chinese food I not only liked, I LOVED! Having authentic Chinese food changed my opinion completely about this cuisine.

I have to agree with the others... save yourself the time and skip the first few pages. Go straight to the back of the menu to find authentic Hong Kong Style fare. Holy mother of god, everything I've tried has been outstanding and each time I leave saying it was the best meal I've tried thus far. 

Everything is extremely cheap and the service is superb. The wait staff are always very helpful and knowledgeable about their food. They'll be quick to recommend something if you're having a hard time deciding. Just ask!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Chinese places around the valley. The decor and seating is completely bare bones. 

I ordered the chicken lo mein and my boyfriend got some spicy beef. 

It really was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've never tried this place before so I went for the first time last night. I ordered a beef dish, fried rice and crab wontons with cream cheese to go. The place was packed, but it had a dirty feel to it and a lot of dirty dishes were stacked in tubs behind the counter. What really disturbed me, though, was that while I was waiting for my food near the register, I had a full view of what was happening in the kitchen since there was no partition. Right in front of the entrance, the cook took out three huge blocks of boneless, frozen chicken parts onto the counter. After sitting they'd thawed a few minutes, I watched him feed them through a deli slicer, into small blocks, presumably to be thawed and cooked up, fat and all. I did not get the impression that the meat was or would be carefully inspected before being cooked. I know a lot of restaurants probably prepare meat that way, but the mass qualities of untrimmed meat I saw being served made me really lose my appetite. When I got home, my wontons smelled really fishy (like they'd been cooked and sat out for a while) and the sauce on my beef was just slimy enough that anything left of hunger quickly fled me. So basically I spent $13 to eat a carton of rice. Their prices are not cheap enough to warrant visiting this place over a quality establishment. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Super authentic, and boy are they speedy!

They have a little something for everybody and holy moly what a menu (Literally like 10 pages)! The $4 \"Americanized\" bowls of Chinese food are a SMOKING good deal. I was astounded by that, and the fact that you can even bring your own seafood in and they will make it to your liking - Black Bean, Szechuan ect...

I just personally wasn't too too impressed by the food I got. I crave authentic/quality dishes, but I ended up with a pretty mediocre one. The Shrimp were super small, and they loaded me up with onions (I get it, hit em with a cheap ingredient in excess). But I don't appreciate paying 9-10 bucks for onions and small shrimp.

Another point off because they don't serve beer. I like a nice crisp Tsing Tao when I am enjoying Chinese food.

Overall - If you want authentic, and frigging delicious WITH beer and fresh seafood? China King (Alma and Ray) or Hong Kong Gourmet (Rural and Ray) are better options. 

C+"}
{"text":"Authentic, cheap, huge servings and incredible menu. Tasty and done right. If it's not on the menu, which would be hard to believe, they'll make it! Real Chinese doesn't get any better. Hong Kong in Mesa."}
{"text":"I found this place unexpectedly by drive by.  VERY large menu.  I tried the Hong Kong style seafood and fried rice.  Very good!  Didn't know what to expect by the appearance, but we were all plesently surprised.  Good food, good prices and great service."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's the only Chinese food we eat. The orange chicken and dried beef chow fun can't be beat. The fried rice is delicious. Prices are great and the staff are really nice, especially to kids."}
{"text":"Went there first time on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch...got the Kung Pao Chicken..it was the BEST I have had in a long time in AZ. It was spicy and authentic which usually it ends up being very fake tasting like Pei Wei...but not this place! Even the Crab Puffs were perfect! Also it was pretty busy for a Friday afternoon at 2, but the service was still great! In addition the prices were remarkable..fed two people with 15 bucks out the door. Bravo Asian Cafe Express...I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Their menu has completely changed.they no longer offer a lot of options as previouslyand most of the dishes are basic."}
{"text":"The food is different. But it's good tasting food. I ordered the General Chicken. Which is like crunchy Chinese style chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce. Also I substituted lo mien for the white rice. Wide noodles and a Vietnamese flavor. Paid $10 with a tip over 15%. I will go back."}
{"text":"The recession proof pricing is the primary reason your wallet will love you for! Rest assure, they do not skimp out on the tasty flavors your true Chinese palette has been accustom to.

Did I mention $1 and eighty some odd cents gets you 2 chicken egg rolls that taste like it was dipped into the fryer a couple dozen times?!  For the same exact price, you can get 3 steamed or deep-fried chicken dumplings!  I hate to sound like a cheapskate but I am just the informant!

If you grow tired of those neighborhood Chinese buffets, come here for a change as you can easily spend less than $40 for 5 people on a family-style dinner set.  If you want to go a la carte, the highest item is $7.  Lunch specials run around $5-6 for a full plate of big portions!

If you cannot decide or just have trouble translating visually what is in the menu, simply gaze around the dining room as they have a set amount of food pictures to go along with text and pricing.  In fact, first time I ordered here was from the wall!  It was this Japanese BBQ Pork Chop over Rice + Egg!  Overall, I would say the menu offers the usual plus more unique, atypical items that is worth trying.  That particular aspect is my second reason why I enjoyed this place.

One caveat that seemed consistent with my experience was the length of wait for your order.  They are not the fastest but your appetite and wallet will walk out immensely satisfied."}
{"text":"The meals were inexpensive, portions big, and the service was very attentive. The store was also clean and welcoming.

I ordered the XO tofu which I thought was delicious. As a Vegetarian it is sometimes hard to find restaurants I can go to without feeling like a burden by special ordering dishes. I noticed there was a number of dishes I could order here which is always nice. 

We also tried their Coconut/tapioca drink which was amazing, and more importantly for me not overwhelmingly coconut tasting. I wish I could have tapioca in everything now! It was very filling, so don't order if you have a small appetite! They also brought it out in a plastic to go cup with a lid and straw which was nice since we were able to take it with us. 

The only complaint I have is that the rice came out in an uncovered bowl, which meant it got a bit dry as it sat there, which was kind of annoying but not a big deal. 

As for groups, it is a small place, with maybe like 8 normal 4-6 person booths, and like 6 or so 4 person square tables so I don't think they could handle too big a group, though not really sure as I only got one look at the dining room."}
{"text":"-Generous portion sizes!
-Staff, while not fluent in English, is friendly outgoing and goes above and beyond the call of duty. 
-Restaurant was full when I came and still got prompt service. 
-Food was delicious
-Prices are very affordable

On the whole, best Asian restaurant I have ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are looking for good service, good food, and good prices. I ordered the \"bowls\" it comes with an entrée and steamed rice for around $4. The food tasted great, the right amount of spice (which might be too much for some), and there was plenty of it! This place was packed at 8pm which says something about how good it is. The rest of the menu is also very reasonably priced. Of note, the staff were friendly and my take out order was correct, which seemed to be rare before coming here. The decor on the inside was lacking, but who cares, the food is cheap and good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and I wish I still lived on that side of town.  Now, it's over a 30 minute drive for me to get there.  All of their food is amazing and at such unbelievable prices.  We always order from their Hong Kong Style menu.  The service is also great.  It's family owned so you'll see the parents and grown adult kids helping out."}
{"text":"Delicious and super cheap! Will absolutely be going back soon. The $3.99 bowls are such a great deal!"}
{"text":"There's this Chinese math teacher at the school I work at (I know, how cliche right?) and he's been telling me all year that I HAVE to go here, and that it's the most authentic Chinese food around town.  So finally, I did.  I have no idea about authenticity, but I do know it was delicious and cheap.  It was pretty crowded on the day we came in, but we found our own seat and waited a few minutes before menus were brought to us.  There are about a billion choices, all of them priced well under 10 bucks.  This place simply cannot be beat for value.  

Absolutely clueless about what to order, I stuck with what I knew, and got the Orange Chicken Bowl, an egg roll and a can of soda that only cost 92 cents.  Our food didn't take too long, and my egg roll came out first.  It was so tasty!  It was packed full of good stuff and the sauce to dip it in was quite good.  My Orange Chicken Bowl came out in the shape of a plate.  I thought that was odd, but who really cares.  The orange chicken was really good.  It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly.  The fried rice was the best fried rice I have ever had.  I still think about it actually.

I would definitely love to come back to this place, especially since it is right by the Light Rail.  Hopefully I will be better prepared to order something a little more adventurous next time."}
{"text":"Always busy but they always find a table for you.

Master Chef Michael Leung keeps it simple, fast and reasonable prices.

All dishes are prepared Hong Kong Style and delicious. We frequently order the 5 course meal for $49 which you choose 5 the 5 dishes and comes with chow mein and fried rice.

We chose the fish fillet, orange chicken, Salt and pepper pork chops, pepper beef and short ribs in black bean sauce. 

Each dish was excellent and actually seemed larger in quantity than before. 

This restaurant is always packed with Asians which is a great sign meaning that the food is great, inexpensive and fast.

One of my other favorite dishes is the chicken curry but today I had to pass and wanted to try other items. 

Will drive 25 miles in a heartbeat to dine here because of the quality and price.

Great food!"}
{"text":"It has been a year since I was there. Prices are still great. However, the food was just average. We order Salt and pepper chicken and it was very dry. However, the spicy chicken dish was great. 

Their services are not so great. I literally had to walk up to the counter after waiting for someone to come over for 15 minutes. Then, it took them 15 minutes to give us the check and boxes. However, it only took them 2 minute to pick up my credit card. Very interesting."}
{"text":"My husband, daughters, and I all loved the food. I could not believe my picky eatter even had 2nds. NO MSG at all and the food doesn't need it. Still had lots of left overs but I can't wait to go back."}
