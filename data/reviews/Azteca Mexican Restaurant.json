{"text":"Great little Mexican place. Nothing super fancy but for the money you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was priced great! Food and desert were beyond excellent. Even got a private miriachi performance on sunday evening. Highly reccommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my staple restaurants to take out of town guests to.  Their shrimp is huge, the food is consistently tasty, and the atmosphere and service are always on point.  My dad got the camerones de ajo (garlic shrimp).  I got the camerones a la diabla (spicy shrimp).  The garlic shrimp was awesome. It came with vegetables.  The spicy shrimp was ok... no veggies.  My dad got a margarita and was impressed with the size and strength of the alcohol in the drink."}
{"text":"This was my family's third visit to Azteca, and my fourth with my honey. It was his birthday, which I quietly mentioned to our server. Although, it was a Monday (June 1, specifically), the dining rooms and even the bar was crowded. That being said the service was prompt & pleasant. Having 3 hungry young men at the table kept the chips & salsa person busy. I knew better than to partake, because the entrées are huge. I did have a very large Margarita, and my honey and eldest son had 2 of the largest Does Equis that I've ever seen. Each time I visit I try to order something different, rather than my fave from my first Mexican restaurant in Charlotte when I arrived some 30 years ago-El Cancun. They too had an amazing air of authenticity & super food. My honey had a dish with the mole sauce (which is a delightful mix of dark chocolate & spices, my eldest ordered the Steak Azteca- a nice piece of meat with rice & refried beans. He said the steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare. The younger boys ordered the super nacho plate. I fell back on my old El Cancun fave- the large chicken burrito. I was not disappointed. It was filled with good quality chicken breast & all was seasoned to perfection. Portions were so large we all brought food home. Finally, my honey was amused to have the sombrero put on his head and have his birthday celebration. More to go boxes needed, as the boys brought home their dessert. I wasn't left out, as even though, I didn't order dessert, they brought over a couple of Cinnamon chips topped with whipped cream and a cherry! We will continue to go to Azteca, especially as summer comes, just to drink margaritas on the patio. Well done Azteca!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We frequent a lot as it is close to my work. Sometimes there is a short wait but they are always about to accommodate us. They have great lunch specials and you can get a lot of food for under 10$."}
{"text":"Loved the place! Service was really good. Guacamole on the table was just as I wanted. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Ever since moving from Texas to Charlotte area, I have been trying to find The Tex-Mex food that i'm familiar with and have been disappointed over and over again here.  But someone recommended Azteca to us and I was not disappointed.  The food, while not outstanding, was much much better than other Mexican restaurants here and I especially liked how they prepared the guacamole table side.  Came at lunch time and found two very large groups (20 at each table) so expected to wait for food and drinks.  To my surprise service was prompt and food tasted fresh.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! My daughter just flew in from the UK on break from University and of course she chose Azteca for her first meal back in the States. The homemade guacamole is always a good choice and the margaritas are the best in town. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"The guy here - Louis - was rude and racist. He could not serve us vegetarian option when we asked for the menu item without the meat. He said they don't do that. We always get that in most of the mexican restaurant we visited. This guy is a moron and seems like he is fine with us reporting this online when I said so. I would ask everyone not to visit this racist place, who can't even speak good English, I am sure he spits on the food he serves."}
{"text":"Service was really slow, however we were there on lunch midweek. I can look past those kind of things, next problem was our food. My buddy ordered a hard taco and two enchiladas and I ordered Mexican story fry. Food comes out and his \"hard\" taco is SOAKED in grease and juices from the enchiladas. My meal was alright, really greasy though. Just based off of this experience since it's my first time, I won't say I won't come back. It will just be quite a while until I give it another shot. Would not recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"WARNING! On June 25th, I ordered chicken tortilla soup to go from Azteca Mexican Restaurant - Smith Corners. After driving home and getting settled (nearly 25 minutes later) the container which was not secured by the manager who packed my order, spilled into my lap. I was rushed to the hospital where it was determined that I had received 2nd degree burns from their soup, through denim jeans, nearly HALF AN HOUR LATER! I have been given the run around from the restaurant, their management, and their insurance group The Main Street America Group who refuse to cover my just medical expenses or answer my questions. Those of you that know my family and I know that we are honest, hard-working people who don't ask for more than we are justly due. I am asking you join my family and I in spreading this warning by reposting this and boycotting this restaurant. If you do choose to dine with them, I don't recommend the soup."}
{"text":"Went late (9:30pm) on a Monday night.  It wasn't busy, but I wasn't worried about that.  Decor is nice, lots of seating.  Everything was very clean.  I was seated quickly and chips and salsa were brought to the table.  Chips were nice and hot, but the salsa was gross.  Now, having said that; maybe it was because it was the end of the night, etc.  So, we'll give that a pass.  I ordered the carnas buritto and it was super!  Portions were nice and the food was delicious.  Waiter was very attentive.  I also had a piece of 3 layer cake and it was awesome too!  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"My most FAV mexican restaurant EVER! I've been eating here for almost 7 years and won't go anyplace else! It's not fancy, totally authentic, reasonablly priced and most importantly DELICIOUS! Everything from their cheese dip, table-side guac and  homemade flour tortillas to their wonderful staff and service, this place is a must! The staff are so friendy and treat you like family. I'm not saying there's no competion but this place has it all...a complete authentic experience!"}
{"text":"The fajitas were good, the portions are huge you can definitely share a meal!! My kids had the burritos they said they liked them  our waiter was very friendly the decor was original and some of the employees had on special cultural uniforms. Theirs a lady that brings a cart if you order guacamole and prepares it in front of your table we enjoyed that. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and price.  We're from Texas and this is the closest we've ever found to the Tex-Mex food we love.  Try the cheese enchiladas - yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Was staying close by, a fifteen minute walk away. So worth the \"dangerous, un-lit walk\" (I was staying across the freeway and had to walk there)
Fresh guac made right in front of the table so you get it tasty just to your buds!
The waitress recommended everything, but said to try a little of everything the dish with steak,shrimp, and chicken (I forget the name) was best. It comes with beans and rice.
SO GOOD! Wish they had a location in New York City, I'd be a constant costumer ;)"}
{"text":"Every time  I come here the service is great and food is delicious.  Use to come a lot and stopped but I definitely need to start coming back because I forgot how good this place is."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  The arroz con pollo is awesome (chicken in rice with a red sauce on top of melted cheese).  They have some tacos which are not on the menu which are my favorite. They ar called tacos de asada and they bring 4 with a small bowl of beans on the  side.  There enchiladas are excellent as well as their burritos.  To drink try the Horchara, a Mexican rice milk drink."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. I went with my friend. The guy who served us was very unprofessional. That spoiled our dinner experience here. He was not taking order properly. My friend ordered vegetarian salad and he brought ham salad. We asked him to get new vegetarian salad and he just removed ham on top and brought the same salad which is very annoying for vegetarian guys. Not only messed up the order but the way he talks the way he responds. We asked him to get drinks menu and he forgot that. We asked him to get salsa and he forgot that. The other guys who were serving other tables kind of sensed that we are waiting on something and brought us the menu and salsa. Might ruin your experience too. Think before you go here. I will never go to this restaurent."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it's a bit over priced. My burrito literally only had the steak in it."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food ever. Large portions and great chips, salsa, and cheese dip! Really love the service also."}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food, very similar to the style in Texas.  A tad bland for my family but we are more used to California/Baja style.  A nice surprise to find this good of Mexican in NC, good atmosphere and price is right as well.  Had \"Super Nachos\", also tried \"chile rellanos\", \"tamales\" and \"enchiladas\".  Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I am not an expert on Mexican good but I know what tastes good. The food here is delicious. I have been here twice and both times were great. Sunday afternoon they had a mariachi band which was awesome and also they had the lunch menu which is a great value, too.
The service is good as they come and refill your drinks and chips without being asked."}
{"text":"Guacamole is Bland, staff is friendly and food is great, but they have hidden fees they charged me for limes and on the plate ordered i didnt want the sour cream, when i got my food they left out the cheese also, so i asked for the cheese that was supposed to be on my food, but they charged me for it!"}
{"text":"Only Mexican Restaurant in town. Pico is legit, got to get the Guac, mariachi bands on Friday!"}
{"text":"If you desire real Mexican food this is where it is at! Especially the location on Woodlawn. Great traditional dishes as well as the tex/mex so many Americans enjoy. The salsa is unique and you get a free small desert at the end of every meal."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  This place is the real deal.  So authentic. So tasty.  Family of 4 passing through Charlotte for the night and stopped by...left feeling like I'd never eat again for $85.  Would definitely stop by again if I was in the area.  Parking kinda sucks @ dinner time and you need to park in a shady Days Inn lot."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food north of the border. Queso is great. The Fajitas Quesadilla is fantastic. Haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't good. Soccer is on the tv, and on Sunday's you may find a mariachi group playing."}
{"text":"The tacos were great but all the sides that go along with them lacked flavor. The décor and feel of the restaurant was great, but only half of a meal with taste is not a good enough reason to go back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Go there weekly with a buddy of mine. Great food with a fun environment too. The amount of food you get is well worth the few bucks it costs. Just don't touch the hot plates."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, and not too expensive. They have really great lunch specials and their chips and queso are amazing. However, the service was so bad. My waiter took probably close to 20 minutes just to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to take our order (after the drinks) we were probably there for close to 45 minutes before we got our food. (We went around noon, so it really wasn't busy at all)  my friend, who I went with, asked the waiter a question about the menu, and he looked at her like she was dumb and never answered her question, instead make a sarcastic remark to her. 
To be honest, the foods good, so I can see why people go here a lot.. But personally, the service was so bad, I would rather pay the extra money for the better service then come back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! But the staff that greets you can be kinda rude. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"I've eaten here with my family at least once every other week since this place opened. I don't know how many times that amounts to??  (100 plus??) Of any restaurant in Charlotte this seems to be about the most consistent if ever been to. I've honestly never had a bad meal here no matter what I get. We usually have  large combo's  ...all under $10.-. You have to ask for some of their salsas,salsa verde, pico de gallo, and salsa de la drilla (nice heat) (all free..just ask) when they bring chips. 
Huge portions, reasonably priced home made everything! Their signature carne asada, skirt steak flame broiled to your liking is excellent, and that is around $14.- Their sweet tea is good but if you want to step out try their horchada/rice almond milk with a sweet cinnamon spice..awesome! We drive 40 miles round trip to go here.  I'm glad it's not closer, we'd probably sell our stove."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants. The shrimp fajitas are amazing!!!!! We always receive great service when we visit and my husband love their guacamole that they make at your table."}
{"text":"I am from Dallas, Texas transplanted to the Charlotte, North Carolina area. As an aficionado of Mexican cuisine, Azteca Family Restaurant Is the BEST Mexican food I have EVER had. You won't find your palate wanting when you eat here. The service is excellent and the management is second to none. 

Five-out-of-five stars, Azteca Family Restaurant is a six."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Had to ask for salsa three times.  Guys next to us came in 10 minutes after we did and got served first.  We walked out and won't go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Azteca!!  Mexican is my favorite food and this place is awesome!!  Great food and great service!  And the prices are reasonable.  I have also been to the one on Woodlawn and it's just as nice!  The servers are always upbeat and friendly.  I would really recommend you come and try :) I will definitly be coming back!  I have many times!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! And that's kinda surprising since California we have tons of good Mexican restaurants. But I we are ever back in Charlotte we will be back here to eat again."}
{"text":"This by far is one of the best Mexican restaurants. I've eaten lunch and dinner at Azteca numerous times. I would recommend anyone to try it. I can guarantee you'll love it. There are a variety of choices on the menu, but may I also add the wait staff provides outstanding service. I eat here at least once a week. I wish this place got more recognition. I've had chalupas and deluxe burrito. Both plates are under $10, yet have more than enough food."}
{"text":"Top notch service, great food and authentic dishes, fresh guacomole cart that comes around... Atmosphere is very \"touristy\" but it plays well with the ambience. If you haven't been here, you need to come at least once!"}
{"text":"Decent mix of authentic and Tex mex on the menu, in a place attached to a rather sketchy Days Inn. I ordered a Pacifico (on tap, no less!) and the chili verde with some corn tortillas on the side. 

Meanwhile I occupied myself with the chips and salsa. Chips were okay, a little thick and not eatm, but not bad. The first two rounds are free. The salsa (red) came in a small shallow bowl, so difficult to dip. The flavor was mediocre. I asked for something spicier so they brought me their tomatillo salsa which (.first time I'd seen it) had chilis de Arbol in it. Spicy, but good.

Then the chili verde arrived, accompanied by refritos and rice. The rice was a little dry and bland; the beans were delicious!!!! A little too good as I ate more than I intended. The chili verde was okay, maybe a slightly different style than I've ever tasted. The pork was tender and served generously; the verde sauce didn't reflect the tartness of tomatillo very much and really had a stronger oregano flavor than I've tasted in other preparations. 

Service was prompt and very friendly and the meal with beer and tip was less than twenty bucks. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Chose Azteca over another Mexican restaurant nearby based on the reviews on yelp and I'm glad I did.  Sat at the bar and had a 32oz beer and chips and salsa in front of me almost immediately. 
Decided to order the chicken fajitas and they were delicious. After eating all of the chips and salsa, I ended up being able to bring home 2 fajitas.  I didn't get the table side guac, but I saw it made for 2 different tables nearby and it looked great. They also lowered the price from what some people are reviewing...$6.95 for one avocado and $8.95 for 2. 
Great place to grab some delicious Mexican food. Their lunch menu looked really great and cheap too."}
{"text":"The food was horrible, the service was worth. My 5 year old ordered a Quesada and got a taco instead. Spent 45.00 for LUNCH. On the LUNCH special menu. Tried to explain the food was inccorect and was insulted. Will NEVER return. Was refused when asked to speak to a manager. Do not eat here. Horrible."}
{"text":"Very friendly - excellent for large parties great Mexican food - large potions and their make at the table guacamole is amazing - family friendly"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with food and service. I am rarely in the University area but went to Northlake mall a few weeks ago with a friend and decided to grab lunch here. I have always enjoyed Azteca off Independence. I had been to this location several years ago and it was ok but not this time. The server we had apparently had  someplace he needed to be or would rather be. He was very impatient when we were trying to decide what to eat. Once we decided the meals were not as good as in the past. I ate less than half of mine and the server never asked if everything was ok just came by and said are you done and took my plate. Oh well, not like I would be going back here soon but now I will certainly not recommend it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte Area. Have been many times and always a good experience. The food and staff are always great. You must get the Guacamole made fresh at your table. Love it."}
{"text":"Meh...Three Amigos is my normal go to spot for Mexican food here in Charlotte.  But I was feeling a bit under the weather and decided to try this place out as it's closer to where I live.   Ample parking which I liked, but food a different story.  I ordered Small Combination plate with one taco & one enchilada.  I prefer care asada as my meat option, but I couldn't get it with this combo.  It's a different combination plate of 4 carne asada tacos 12.95.   So I choose shredded beef instead.   I did not try the guacamole.  The salsa tasted like hunts tomato sauce, and I didn't care for the shredded coleslaw they bring you.  Food came out and yes the portions are huge.  I ate very little.  Shredded beef tasted very bland in both the enchiladas and taco.   Rice I thought tasted mushy, but the beans were ok.  Won't be going back.  There are far better options for authentic Mexican food.  I'm sticking with Three Amigos."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Chips, salsa and \"slaw\" come right away.  I eat Mexican in some of the best places for it, so my rating more a \"global\" scale. For the Southeast, this place is above average.  First: salsa is ok. Pretty watery but good flavor. Chips seem house made-also good.   The \"slaw\" is very good. It's basically ceviche with no meat. 

I ordered carnitas. Pork of course-they offer beef and chicken carnitas, which is weird. The portions are very large and come on a huge plate. Rice and beans were as expected (surprisingly they are sub-par at a lot of places-not here). Carnitas normally are hewn from a large roast (can be fried). They serve 1\"cubes. Not really traditional. Pretty good flavor, but if you like carnitas, these won't satisfy. Served with pickled onions. Good but odd. Should be lots of fresh onions and cilantro.  Also, there was more slaw, and excellent nopal (cactus) salad. Corn tortillas were store bought, probably all that is avail here.  Guacamole is good, but not enough provided. Overall good, but I would order something different next time"}
{"text":"I have used Yelp for over two years and have never felt compelled to review a restaurant until now, mostly because for 9+ years I worked in the restaurant industry and understand the consequences of a negative review.  However, tonight, after my Azteca Mexican Restaurant experience I can say it was absolutely one of my worst restaurant experiences.  The front of house staff was decently friendly, as was the staff who brought out the chips.  I ordered take-out and sat at the bar so I could have a margarita while I waited.  The bartender, initially, was attentive enough, in that he took my food and margarita order.  After that the bartender was slack, hostile and subjectively waited on his patrons.  I was only able to get his attention to order a second and final margarita because I was sitting in front of the beer taps, he NEVER asked how I was doing or if I needed anything else, he simply dropped the check.  However, the patron sitting a couple seats down was repeatedly asked if she needed anything or if she was okay.  Again, highly subjective!  Throughout my wait, I heard him, hostilely, yell for the \"bus boy,\" and use unfriendly rhetoric towards other staff members, while among restaurant guests.  Highly unprofessional.  All the while, he continued to only be friendly to the same guest and no one else!  Upon arriving home, which is approximately ten minutes from the restaurant, our food was soggy and basically inedible from all the juices soaking COMPLETELY through the tortillas (i.e. holes in the tortillas).  The salsa and chips were good; however, for $70 the quality of the food and margaritas is much overpriced!  For the sake of other staff members and guests of Azteca Mexican Restaurant, I hope that this was an isolated incident, but for me this is the only and LAST time I will visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros - fresh

Cons - limited to 2 small baskets of chips (before charge), small entre, loud music. 

Taxco in Huntersville MUCH better!"}
{"text":"A \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with really delicious authentic Mexican food and a wide variety to choose from :) The indoor decor was really beautiful too and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I ordered a fajita quesadilla and why I got was a fajita burrito swimming in a pool of fluid which caused the bottom to be mushy and pasty...quite gross!  Don't think I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm almost afraid to give them a good review because I don't want everyone to crowd the place.

For a coworker and I, this is a weekly lunch stop.  We love the lunch specials.  For the price, quality, and quantity they can't be beat."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Charlotte from Ohio and we have been on the hunt for a good mexican place. Needless to say we are still on the hunt. You would think the closer you get to Mexico the better the food, but that is not the case. 
When we got to the place, there was a long line so we thought we were going to have to wait but we got right in. There was a live band playing music which was very nice and set the mood. The service was very prompt and polite.
 The chips were just standard chips but the salsa was what I called onion soup with no flavor or heat, and they also served us with what looked like coleslaw. YUCK! I have been noticing that all the mexican places we go to have very soupy and or watery salsa which makes me very sad. My husband and I just got back from Cozumel and it was the most flavorful and thickest salsa you could ever have! 
I ordered small combination number one (Hard taco and enchilada) and it was inedible! The taco shell was soggy, I had the server bring me a new shell but that didn't help. The beef in both the taco and the enchilada was a low grade beef like taco bell but with no seasoning (Must be the lack of dairy farms in the area). The enchilada tasted like a soggy diaper! I couldn't bring myself to even eat it. The rice was dry and tasteless and both the beans and the enchilada came with some sort of yellow cheese on top... that tasted awful. The beans were also watery underneath all the yellow cheese. 
My husband got the chicken fajitas and we shared it. He seems to like all the food but he was a little tipsy from the very strong margarita. I thought the fajitas were just okay, the onion in them tasted like a sweet onion which i do not fancy. I ended up asking for more salsa because I was still hungry! 
However at the end they brought some sort or sweet tortilla dessert. I thought that was a nice added touch but not enough to make me want to ever go back. 
We paid 33.00 for 2 people and one margarita, so it was pricey.
Either way the hunt is still on for a good mexican place in the Carolina's."}
{"text":"Everything from this place was five stars. Food taste like heaven and the service is absolutely wonderful! Great place to have a great time!"}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel nearby, and most everyone says as Aztecca is the place to go for good Mexican food.  The outside is pretty lit up easy to find, inside looks like a typical Mexican place. The service was outstanding, however the food that I ordered fell a little short of my expectations. I Ordered the Carne Asada tacos, the upgraded one on the menu. When they came out the tortillas were soggy, I think they were supposed to be, but I just didn't care for that much. There wasn't a lot of Carne inside the tacos, and the pico de gallo was a strange lettuce combination that I also didn't very much care for.  The chips and salsa we're good however."}
{"text":"Very good food here! The plates were huge! 
The salsa was awesome! Horchata was delicioso! I'll definitely go back for a good Mexican meal!"}
{"text":"We are there on a busy Sat night but were seated promptly. Service was excellent and food was out fast. Have to say everything was very good and was kicking my butt for having gotten an appetizer at the bar before going to the restaurant. Will definitely be on our go to list when back in town."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! Good price! Complimentary sopapillas when you dine in. I recommend the Steak Torero. You're missing out if you don't eat there!"}
{"text":"Azteca is my favorite restaurant!!! The food is always fresh and hot! The service is always excellent as well!!! The margaritas are on point!!! I use to order Arroz Con Pollo for years at Azteca on Woodlawn before the one near NorthLake Mall was built.  But ever since the one on Smith Corners Blvd was built, I am a more frequent customer because it's closer. Now I order Fiesta Jalisco. I am addicted.......you know I have to wash it down with a margarita or two!!!"}
{"text":"Azteca has been a favorite of mine since way before Yelp, so I am disappointed that my first visit since that time was my least favorite.
I met my two best friends for what has become an annual before Christmas craziness dinner. 

 Azteca does have the best pico de gallo of any other place and our queso was delicious as well. My friends enjoyed to very delicious margaritas while I drank a cold Negro Medelo.

 Dinner is where I found my self a bit disappointed.  We all ordered combination plates, mine was the taco with ground beef.  Our service was slow for the night and my plate arrived warm with one side of my corn tortilla taco completely soggy.  

We had a very long wait for our checks which were split incorrectly and there was further confusion about how my one friend's visa was charged.  The waiter was was very appologetic and the situarion was resolved, but very awkward.

I am a great fan of Azteca, and I chalk this visit up to an off night."}
{"text":"Started with a virgin pina colada..the glass of which was humongous. But i loved it.. Their complimentary chips were fresh and crispy, the salsa was tasty too. We ordered the guacamole and this part is interesting : the waiter made delicious fresh guacamole direct from the avocado fruit, right in front of us :D :D. For the main course, i shared the enchilada , tostado combination with my mother. it was good..
I took away one star because being a vegetarian, all dishes come with the same same black bean filling. so apart from the presentation all the dishes taste pretty much the same. So for this I wont blame it on the restaurant but ya just doesnt make me want to give full stars.
Nice interiors, friendly waiters and good food.. u shud definitely go if in the area ..totally worth it.."}
{"text":"Great place. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. I recommend the guacamole. Service, environment, and food were all great. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant, and in my opinion the best one in Matthews and maybe even Charlotte. It has great food and never once has anyone I know been disappointed here. It's service is good and quick. The food is great and seems to be always fresh. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Food and prices were good.  We had two plates that had mushrooms, one with chicken and one with shrimp and were pleased with both.  And, of course, we loved the cheese dip!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. I love Mexican food, but I'm such a picky eater it's kind of difficult to choose something. The servers here are bilingual and some of them struggle a little with English, but they're always polite if they don't understand. They always manage to get my food right, also. The wait on all aspects of service are a little long, no matter if it's busy or slow."}
{"text":"First time and I can tell this place is very authentic. We got the cheesy bean dip and it was to die for! Shredded beef enchiladas were amazing! We will be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"It is my preferred Mexican place when I want good Mexican food!  Have been going for close to the 11 years that I have lived in Charlotte!  The best Mexican food that I have had outside of Mexico"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!! This place is has great food, being from California you aren't going to find much better. Prices are fair and they have a great bar, I highly recommend a top shelf margarita vs the house as its just around a $1 more. I eat here at least 2-3 times a month and the food is consistently good. They have hand made fresh tortillas and have a cart that will come around to your table and prepare fresh guacamole. Sundays and Mondays they have live mariachi too.

The only complaints I would have is service is a little lacking once they get busy around 6pm and food maybe slow to come out as well. The inside as far as the tables and some of the decor could use an upgrade as they are pretty old and the benches at the booths are well used. 

On a side note, I'm actually surprised by any bad reviews here but I've been told by others that a certain manager doesn't work Mondays and things aren't the same when they are not around (Never been on a Monday so I can't say myself.)

 Just wanted to add one more thing anyone that disputes the authenticity of the food or  the quality of the food. Check this place out between 6ish and 8 in the evening and check out the amount of Hispanic people there if it were as bad as the 1 or 2 star ratings some of the people have given I don't think they would be eating here."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to area and decided to try it out it took a long time for some one to come take our order the restaurant atmosphere and food was pretty good until that giant cockroach ran across my table and into the mini blind. We notified waitress but all she cared about was cashing us out we couldn't even enjoy our dessert I had to get out of there I was disgusted and itchy. I can never go back after that"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere here.  They have a mariachi band, fresh ingredients for guacomole and salsa, great margaritas, and great food.  I had the pollo chipotle and it was fabulous.  Definitely a great place for your go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. The Fresh Margarita is not to be missed. The spicy salsas actually live up to their name; the table side guac is fresh and consistent; and our favorite dishes include Carne Asada Tacos, Expresso burrito, Pollo Poblano, and really most anything we've tried. Oh, try the bar area- Carlos and Juan will take excellent care of you!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to go for Mexican and stopped in for a bite tonight. We pulled up and it looked like there was going to be a long wait for a Friday night. The hostess got us seated in less then 10min which was FAB! We decided to get the chips and queso to snack on while waiting for our food to arrive. I ordered the mango margarita which comes in a huge glass, so be prepared to come thirsty. While we waited for our food I noticed they had carts going around making table side guacamole. How cool is that? -Wish I had read T.T.'s post before going. 

Food: My husband ordered one of the large specials... The plate was HUGE! I still have no idea how he ate the entire meal. I got a smaller plate the chicken chimichanga, very tasty, not the best I've ever had but definitely very good and authentic. 

Service: The waiter we had was fast and always seemed to be right there just when we needed something. He was very attentive. My husband is a tea guzzler and his glass was never empty. 

I do have to say that this is a very family friendly restaurant. Be prepared to see kids and people of all ages dining. I would suggest if you have a choice between Azteca and Montery I would definitely go with Azteca, hands down! Great people, great food, great ambiance!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite! Been going here for years now. Their guacamole is on point, their Deluxe Burrito is the best and they have very good service."}
{"text":"Decor and staff were very nice, EVERYTHING else lacked luster.  Margarita poured from giant plastic container (not made fresh), tasting mostly of sour mix, bad tasting liquidy salsa, overly dried up rice, and WAY greasy tacos that completely fell apart.  Oh, and I asked for guacamole and it never came.  Would not go again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decorations are much better than the food. Not the worst place but not the best either."}
{"text":"I have been to Azteca in another location before, but 1st time at this location.  Excellent Mexican food, good service.  Always my favourite item is Chicken Carnitas extra spicy, and the food was within the normal wait time (around 30 minutes), waiter checked on us few times to refill water and chips etc.  Overall it was good experience."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch several times, but we finally went for dinner last night - it was hopping! We each had a Fresh Margarita and it was delicious - made with fresh lime and orange juice. We ordered the fajitas (one shrimp. one chicken) and the Enchilladas Suizas. The portions are HUGE and we couldn't finish it all - try as we might. (No problemo! Leftovers are another meal in the future!) It was very busy with a mix of groups of friends to families to foursomes in booths. Obviously family friendly and very noisy, but not in a bad way. Will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I had many wonderful meals at Azteca throughout the past year. But this past visit on 1/10/2017 my meal was horrible! I ordered a green chili pork burrito. What I got was a soggy, barely warm burrito with 2 pieces of meat and covered with sauce that tasted like watered down tomato soup. (Which I believe it was) The waitress was nice about it and assured me that was the correct sauce so I ate 1/2 of it. I felt ill the rest of the night. I won't be eating there again for quite some time"}
{"text":"I have passed this place for over a year and the parking lot is always packed. The food was pretty good but for the $20 price tag for steak tacos I expected more. The portions were very large however so I guess that balanced it out. I was only able to eat half of my meal the portions were so large. I got 3 tacos and an entire plate full of rice. Only issue with my food was that the tacos were drinched in salsa to the point where they were falling apart (the salsa was just poured over the entire plate and not on each taco). 

As for the customer service everyone was very nice and polite. I would definitely go back here again, but just order something different."}
{"text":"The food is always great. The people are nice. Service is excellent. I've eaten there 10 times now and every meal was a good experience."}
{"text":"We have lived in Matthews 8 years and have been to Azteca several times but this last time was awful. We sat for over 20mins waiting for a server to take our drink order. 
We ordered cheese dip and it was brought out 3 mins prior to our entrees.   We asked the server for the cheese dip 3 times. 
My husbands food came out cold. The plate was hot the burrito was cold. When he told the server he asked if he wanted it really hot and brought back the same plate re heated in the microwave. 
He also took chips off another table and said they were meant for us but put on the wrong table. 
We did notice the owner asked several people input area about their meals but she did not do us. 
Very disappointed with our visit."}
{"text":"Right after we moved to Charlotte, I was talking to a local in a bar about how I wanted great Mexican food. He directed me to Azteca, and told me not to worry about the fact it was connected with a Days Inn.

That was 8 years ago, and after trying numerous Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, Azteca remains far and away our favorite. The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out. 

The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song. They chose Elvis, which cracked us up.

My husband loves the Arroz con Pollo. I switch around dishes, but lately my favorite is the Pork Carnitas. For $11, you get a plate with so much food on it that taking home leftovers is a must. We've had nothing but great visits to Azteca!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 starts because of the terrible service. We have not had a refill on our drinks in over 15 minutes, waited for extra chips and still didn't receive our extra sour cream that we will probably be paying for on the bill. Not to mention while we're getting terrible service the servers are all gathering around chit-chatting. Don't sit at any of the booths by the bar. 

The food is great, guacamole is 5 stars, sweet tea is another good perk, wish I could have enjoyed this place and given credit to the food. 



UPDATE: went back and had the same person as our waiter lmao go figure. The food is amazing and the margarita's are strong. Our waiter definitely did better this time and didn't forget about us."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The cabbage salsa they serve with regular salsa and chips is delicious.  Great variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Summary: Excellent food!!! The guacamole was made right there at the table. The service was wonderful. The Marriott cheese band was great. I would go again.

My family and I were traveling through North Carolina. We decided to stop and have dinner at a Mexican restaurant. This one popped up on yelp it looked like a good place to go so we tried it out.

We shared the tres alteca and a Texas fajitas. The food arrived hot and fast. It was way more than three people should eat, but we tried. It was excellent. For new people going I would definitely recommend the homemade guacamole and tres alteca."}
{"text":"I love Azteca!  This location is large and bright, and is a great place for larger groups.  Although it always seems busy, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.  My favorite meal is the chicken fajitas, and the serving is more than enough to share with another person.  Service has always been fast and attentive.  Top shelf margaritas are generous with the liquor. ;) 

My only complaint is that they recently changed their chips and I really dislike them!  They are thick and seem stale.  But, I'll still go and skip the chips, and have the complimentary sopapillas for dessert."}
{"text":"I visited Azteca while I was in the Charlotte area on a business trip and I am not sure what the hype is about. I am from Texas and know real Tex-Mex and this is not it!!! 

I am rating the food 1 STAR and customer service/ambience 5 STARS.

Our waiter was very friendly and always had a smile on her face, I really liked her, but the food was very gross! My coworker and I shared the Fiesta Azteca which is a sampler platter and it was not very good. The chicken flautas were so dry drenching them in hot sauce didn't fix them! The potato skins were greasy and soggy, not crispy. And bacon wrapped shrimp were burned to prediction with a black charcoal taste! For a $26 appetizer, I was hoping for something more edible. 

Will I be back? Yes, for the margaritas! NO FOR THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome true Mexican eatery! It's tucked away in front of an old motel and doesn't look like much from the outside but do not let that fool you!!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place is packed at lunch time.

I ordered chili relleno and it's probably one of the worst rendition I have ever had. Rice and bean are average at best. Underneath the saltiness, the food was frankly tasteless. Salsa was very watery.

It was the first time I saw Shirley Temple and Roy Rogers on a Mexican restaurant's menu. Really?"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could since I never actually ate the food other than the chips. The chips and salsa were good. The water was wet. That's about all i can say since we waited 35 min after placing our orders before we ever saw our waitress again. We only saw her again after my husband walked over to the bar to complain that we haven't even had water refills. The bartender was surprised but no apologies. We asked for a manager and only then did our waitress see him and run in the back to get our food. She blamed the kitchen for being slammed but once I touched the plate I knew she either forgot us or didn't care about her table since the plates and food were cold. 
We only get to eat out once a month due to budget and we weren't waisting our time or money here. Once the food was dropped off no one checked on us or the food. We walked out, left the food on the table. Again we only had chips, salsa, and water. They were not slammed or even busy. And no manager ever came out."}
{"text":"Love all of their locations. I always get enchiladas, and the meat is seasoned perfectly. Much better than other locally owned Mexican restaurants in Matthews or southeast Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place  2 stars because I liked their chips and service. Other than that I would give it 1 star. Yet another disgusting mexican restaurant in Charlotte. This place is  crawling with horrible food. well, first off I guess this isn't really Mexican food. My husband and I threw most of our food away. Way over priced!! I have no idea why anyone gave this place and Monterey good reviews. bad taste in food, I guess."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and wish I hadn't. The service sucked as my friend kept having to track someone down for chips, salsa, drink refills, and everything else. The ACP sucked in comparison to other places I've been."}
{"text":"Its ok. Nothing to write home about. Kind of cheezy touristy decor but some of the other reviewers seemed to like it. Struck me as kind of a Applebees over decoration in mexican theme."}
{"text":"They are crooks & bamboozled me for a meal that I did not even enjoy! Beware of their pricing and I will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  I have been to this restaurant many times and it only seems to improve every time! Service was great and the food was wonderful! Authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place. We have lived in Charlotte for 9 years always looking for good Mexican. Too bad on this place we had high hopes. Starting with the salsa. Absolutely no flavor. We also tried the verde salsa like water but spicy hot. No flavor. Then on the margaritas. Wow what a disappointment. 

Inside is nicely decorated and the service is fine. Prices are way too high especially for the quality.   Save your money and try another place."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night to grab a quick dinner.

Chips and salsa came out fast (with some slaw that we didn't eat). The salsa was decent. A bit runny but the cilantro in it was flavorful.

We both ordered margs, as they were on special. Huuuuuge drinks! Very tasty. I could probably have handeled mine a bit stronger :)

We got the cheese dip as an appetizer. Very large portion that probably could have fed 8 but, of course, we devoured! It was very tasty and a good consistency (aka, not super congealed white stuff!).

We split the shrimp fajitas for dinner. Definitely plenty for two! They came with rice, beans, a small bit of guac, onions, peppers, and shrimp. Slightly dissapointed in the refried beans cause they were fairly flavorless. Plenty of shrimp to go around!

A-Ok meal!"}
{"text":"My burrito was decent and the service was really friendly. They give you free chips and salsa and a sort of dessert chip at the end which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Azteca it's been a great experience.  Never have to wait too long to have a seat and the food is great. We go here a lot for birthdays because the food is so good and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Aztecs is typically a decent choice for Mexican food in this part of Charlotte. Waiting 20 minutes when we were told a 15 minute wait. When we went to check on the status they said we were never recorded for a table upon arrival. Promptly left."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.  Mostly during lunch.  Excellent menu selection, great service and great tasting Mexican food for a chain restaurant.  Dinner meals are huge and you'll be stuffed when you or if you finish it."}
{"text":"Such. Good. Food.

Seriously...huge portions, good prices, friendly service, festive atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"Food is way too over priced for what it is too expensive and not worth it honestly it's a waste of money I'd rather go to el Valle or Monterey"}
{"text":"Absolutely great Mexican food! If I am ever back in town in Charlotte, I will definitely go again. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time! Most of the time, we have William as our server. He is attentive and amazing at taking care of us! We will definitely be coming back for the amazing margaritas and food! 

Ask for William!"}
{"text":"Don't sit at bar! The bartender Jorge was taking care of us and he was a very disrespectful man! He screams at us like if he was angry or did not want to serve us ! He seem very racist cause he was being rude to us but to a Caucasian family very friendly. The food was good but terrible service by Jorge! If they sit you in the bar just say NO!!"}
{"text":"There are lots of restaurants to choose from in this vicinity, and I wanted to go out on a limb and try a totally new eatery.  My husband, though, preferred to walk across the parking lot from the hotel (after he swore that I could choose--but I digress).  Well, after a sangria and Pork Carnitas, I am so glad we went to Azteca.  The dinner portion is far too big, so I neglected the rice and beans to devour the extremely tender and flavorful pork in a warmed corn tortilla topped with pickled onions.  My husband had a bean burrito meal, I think.  Who knows?  I was busy with my delicacy.  He also drank tea and the bill came to $32.  It was delicioso!"}
{"text":"The food is good- typical Mexican food- nothing special. Service should be improved. The waiters do not speak English. I was brought the wrong dish and overcharged for it. The manager refused to correct the mistake as it was my fault because \"the waiter did not understand me\". We live in America and I speak English- learn English people!

We also weren't given the sweet treat at the end of our meal like the other tables were. We didn't bother asking since our waiter probably wouldn't understand us anyway."}
{"text":"First time here with friends and it will be the last. Sorry, but the food was horrible. Don't  know how people give 4 and 5 stars. Chips and watery salsa, to start. My tableside guacamole lack seasoning just smashed avocado with some onions and cilantro. Nothing impressive. My shrimp cocktail had a lot of shrimp swimming in a bowl of ketchup and the ketchup was hot. Yuck! Last of all the Botana Azteca had bacon wrapped shrimp completely overcooked that if it fell from the table it will bounce. Also lack of seasoning. The other shrimp on the plate was also overcooked but it was so salty you couldn't eat it. $49.00 pls tip for nothing. The only good thing was Ubaldo our waiter very attentive. I will definitely  NOT be back.
."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp before choosing the place for dinner -- and we're delighted that we did.  I can't imagine a more perfect Tex-Mex dining experience.  We had no reservations and walked in 7p on Thursday evening.  The Hostess welcomed us, asked how many.  When we indicated two, we were instantly whisked away to a two-top in the bar area.  Cozy and nice.  Less than a minute after we were seated, our server appeared to take our drink and appetizer order.  A minute after that the guacamole cart came by.  If you like, they make it at your table; pretty impressive.  We declined and a minute later the (generously sized) frozen strawberry Margaritas arrived.  We gave him our order for cheese dip.  A minute later it arrived and was a very generous-sized bowl of white queso w/jalapenos.  We gave him our dinner order and asked him to please wait a few minutes before entering it!  

The queso and salsa and chips were all excellent.  My best first measure of a TexMex restaurant: chips warm and fresh.

Five minutes later I caught his eye and gave him the thumbs-up to enter our dinner order.  Gael had the quesadilla appetizer (huge) and I had my standard two beef enchiladas.  Honestly, five minutes later we were eating.  Both our meals (and the Margaritas) were excellent.

I've never experienced quicker service or friendlier staff than here at Azteca in Matthews NC.

I asked to see the manager and passed on our compliments.  We always do that when the experience is exceptional.

When in the Charlotte area, we'll enthusiastically come here again!"}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent.  The prices are very reasonable.  My only complaint is the drinks can be a little stronger. Try the Pork Canitas."}
{"text":"Got very full eating here. Food was great. Was surprised with the free dessert at the end. Got steak fajitas for $13 after tax. Would come back again. Waitress was really nice too. Chip and salsa were free too."}
{"text":"Worst salsa I have ever tasted. They also would not modify the menu to fit my request. What kind of place doesn't modify a menu for a customer. I will not return!"}
{"text":"Within walking distance from many hotels in the area if your flight was cancelled. Open late. Great service. I recommend the table side prepared guacamole dip. Plates are HUGE! Food comes super quick. Margaritas are a must. The largest size came in what can only be described as a giant fish bowl."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. The food here is amazing. The waiters and waitresses are great and always check on you. The quesadillas are my favorite. The atmosphere here is also good."}
{"text":"Holy mole!  This is some good Mexican food!  Probably not the most authentic in the world but still mighty tasty.  I've never eaten anything bad here and for a while, my bf and I were on an every weekend Azteca cycle.  I love fresh guacamole and they actually have a woman who comes by your table with all the ingredients on a cart who makes it right there in front of you.  You can even pick what ingredients you want more or less of.....light onions, extra tomatoes for me please!   We told our friends who have lived here for a while that we went to eat there and they had one word for it, \"Epic!\"  It may not be THAT good, but for queso dip, tacos, and fajitas it's an excellent.  Full bar, margaritas, and a decent beer selection.  An added bonus: the refried beans are actually slightly spicy and tasty, not brown mush out of a can."}
{"text":"Just like mom and dad used to make! Good food, great customer service. They were so good that I came back two nights in a row and I'm used to authentic Mexican food from Texas."}
{"text":"In town for work, so by myself and got it to go. Asked for a suggestion and was not directed to the most expensive thing on the menu. The staff was very friendly and joked with me while I waited. The food came out fast and hot. I ordered the sopa de tortilla, Arroz Con Pollo (extra spicy) and frijoles negro. The portions are very good and the taste was excellent. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Terribly plain. Haven't been to this location in quite a few years, and now that I've gone back to order some takeout food, I will not be coming back. The chimichanga that I ordered had nothing on top of it when I had asked for everything that it came with except for the sour cream. There was a tiny little dab of guacamole on the side, virtually no lettuce, no tomatoes, and the rice and beans were so flavorless that I could've made it better tasting for myself at home. Next time I'll walk across the street to Sabor Latin Street Grill where they have much better food with much better flavor and a much lower price. Will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Went to Azteca thinking it was another place Ive to in the town I live in but it wasn't. When I walked in I thought I was in a Frida movie (watch the movie) everyone was dressed in authentic Mexican clothes the women had on Chiapas dresses and the men in don Quito minus the hats. The decor was very traditional and felt authentic . I almost felt like I was in Mexico. I was greeted by the manger and the staff as soon as I walked in . I got seated right away,my server from Venezuela (forgot the dudes name bit very polite and friendly)was at my table ready to take my drink order. I only ordered a beer and some shots. I was in town visiting a friend from my old neighborhood. I ordered the fajitas with everything steak,chicken and shrimp. The food was good nothing impressive about it or The restaurant. I will say the staff was very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely go.back when I comeback to Charlotte"}
{"text":"The salsa was delicious. Full of flavor. Their meals are large. Our table of 5 took home as much as we ate. All the food was good and the staff was very attentive. Will mark this to come back."}
{"text":"been coming here for many years ... since they opened in what used ti house Mcguffy's, if that tells you anything.  Anyway, it's our go-to Mexican place.  The food is always good, and the service acceptable ( has actually improved in recent months as they've hired more people).  Take a look around ... lots of Hispanic people eat here.  That's got to say something."}
{"text":"Love Azteca!  Great atmosphere and good food!  Always a fun time with friends at Azteca."}
{"text":"When I think of good Mexican food in Charlotte, this is the first place that pops into my mind. I would've never thought to go to this place since it's randomly attached to the Days Inn but I went here on a whim a couple of years back and have been going ever since. They have fresh salsa along with warm, crisp tortilla chips and have a guac dude rolling around to each table if you so choose to indulge. Their portions are the size of a baby and they offer margaritas in different fruity flavors that are quite strong. I've tried different combos and like I said before, with portions the size of a baby, I often have leftovers. The nachos were amazing as well and were the size of a toddler and cheaper than my margarita (I found this very amusing) I've found service to better in the bar area when I go and you can't beat dining with Telemundo and ESPN in the background! They also give you free little cinnamon crispers topped with whipped cream after your meal. Yay for anything covered in whipped cream! Anytime I've gone there, the service and food are consistent which is a big plus in my world."}
{"text":"Boy, do I miss the salsa here!!! Actually, I really miss all of the food here.
I didn't discover Azteca until my last year of college when I moved to the Northlake area.

This was a frequent dine-in and take-out spot for me. The salsa was always on point with lots of cilantro and onions. I actually try to base my own homemade salsa on the salsa here. It's just that good!

The cheese enchilada has always been good here as well as the beans.
Everything here just always tastes fresh.

They also have massive burritos I've seen my friends order.

This is one of my favorite restaurants overall in the Charlotte area. It's also less gringo than some of the places in University."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here on Sunday with a group of 8. We were seated promptly when we showed up without making any reservations. The waiter was extremely helpful and was attentive. He came back every time someone was running low on drinks. We always order  the guacamole that they come around and make fresh and its some of the best guac I have tasted. The location itself is wonderful and the space is quite big and they utilize it well. 

The food itself is some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Carolinas. I constantly ask my friends \"is it as good as Azteca?\" I usually order the chicken carnitas or arroz con pollo and I have never been disappointed. When I used to live in Charlotte I would frequent here for lunch and their specials are excellent with many starting at around $7. 

Overall great place with excellent affordable food."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The food was very basic. The quesadilla seemed like it was microwaved. The salsa for the chips was terrible, it tasted like onions. I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here on a regular basis. The food is always phenomenal and service is great. Juan is the best waiter, he is personable and makes you feel welcomed. He went out of his way to make sure we were all satisfied and went above and beyond. The food is seasoned wonderfully, this is authentic Mexican food. They have the best horchata in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, ample portions.  I had a large burrito and sides were huge.  Friendly staff. Our group received a complimentary dessert.  Guacamole made tableside was delicious!"}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel near by so I ordered my meal to go.  Cute place, seemed very authentic.  Next time, would love to eat there.  My entree was so delicious, I could not stop eating it.  Highly recommend you try it.  You will enjoy your food and you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"The arroz con pollo is killer!  Get there early at lunch!  The lines can be atrocious.  Tasty margaritas are worth trying as well!  The service is always warm and friendly.  Come hungry....there's a lot of food on them there plates!"}
{"text":"You've got to eat here! They have a Mariachi Band that plays to you on Friday nights... who doesn't love that? The guacamole is so good and fresh- made right at your table."}
{"text":"The chips were the best part about this place! 

The rice was terrible. Our meals were not great. 

The ladies room was out of order and strangely enough they seemed like they didn't want me to leave. They directed me to a shady bathroom past the servers, the dishwashers and cooks in the back. It was boiling hot back there with all kinds of smells. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and an amazing wait staff!! Food is always impeccable and presentation is wonderful!! This is one of our favorite restaurants! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night. Party of 20. My friend and I ordered: Super Nachos and Camarones con hongos. (Mushrooms). Good. We had a lot of fun. Singing Karaoke till they were  closing. I highly recommend the \"Margarita\". Pedro was a great waiter. Thank you Azteca. Definitely coming back!
Ps: you can't go and skip the guacamole with chips.
And there's more parking in the back."}
{"text":"from all the aztecas rest in charlotte this is the best one.  me and husband we are fun of all the aztecas, rest.  great service and delicious margaritas"}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better. Went here for lunch the other day and the place was packed. Seated right away and was met by the server instantly with chips. There was a little man walking around with a make shift cart offering tableside guac. A little odd and pricey. $6 for one avocado or $8 for two...hmmm...ok. Not bad for price of tableside guac if the portion matched the price, which it did not.

Ordered the combo place of tostada, enchilada and taco. Came with typical rice and beans. The portion was HUGE! Could barely finish it and had to wait to start it because it was so hot. Hot like it was sitting under the lamp too long. Flavors were just ok. 

All in all, decent, though not a place I'll likely return considering all the other good Mexican restaurants around town."}
{"text":"Great place!! Delicious, fresh food. Great tableside guac. Big fan of the arroz con pollo. Great takeout too!!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food quick. Good prices and family oriented. The price is good and definitely will be back again. The tableside guacamole is cool too. I like how the staff is dressed up and they treat everyone awesome."}
{"text":"The food was good. Big plates, they barely fit on the table. Food was pretty quick. Kinda shady area, and small parking lot. You can park in the hotel parking lot."}
{"text":"This is probably the WORST customer service I have EVER received. Called and made a reservation for 15 on Thursday for tonight. They wrote it down for the complete wrong date. They then refused to seat us until our whole party was here even though THEY messed up our reservation. They told us they had a table for us and then gave it away even though they told us it was available for us. The woman at the host stand yelled at the host who told us our table was available in Spanish saying they couldn't seat us without everyone here and we were only missing one person. We have been here over an hour and still have not been sat and have had all of our party for 45 minutes. Bar service is awful as well. The guy totally forgot two of our drinks and didn't listen when we told us to split it. Never coming back and still haven't even eaten.
Edit: just ordered and my quesadilla came an hour later and wasn't good at all and my boyfriend's order was completely incorrect. No point in sending them back because they'll just spit in it. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. Service tonight was very slow, and frankly the food was totally unremarkable. I had the Tres Azteca, and while the flavors of the steak and chicken were almost alive, the shrimp was DOA - clearly overly freezer burned and rubbery, and had no discernible flavor.
I asked for *HOT* salsa to liven things up, but their offering was, again, fairly flat.

The flavors did not excite me, the service was tepid, the price was reasonable - but I won't be back."}
{"text":"When I went to check in on Yelp, I couldn't believe I haven't reviewed this place before. Azteca is one of the best Mexican restaurants on the north side of Charlotte. They have a traditional Mexican menu, with lunch specials as well. A great staff and quick ticket time, this is a great place for lunch and dinner. Highly recommend this place if your in the mood for Mexican food in the Charlotte NC area."}
{"text":"Based off of reviews we decided to try this place. First of all I have no idea why some people would be discouraged because it's connected to a Days Inn because it's basically it's own little Mexican place with cute outside seating too. The prices are great and portions are too! We split the large combo and added a taco to it and everything was awesome! We are huge Mexican fans and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not too happy with this restaurant. The portions are big but they give you more fat juice than meat. I ordered the chicken with sour cream which comes with green peppers, I did get a wholleeee bumch of peppers but not really any chicken, it was greasy and not really what I've had before with other Mexican restaurants. My wife's dish was good though, she had the chicken fajitas"}
{"text":"The service was good!  But they literally brought my food out on a serving tray! Definitely worth the money! I got the Pollo Con Crema (sp) and It was delicious, so if you're ever riding down Woodlawn and want to get your belly full definitely stop by!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! The closest to authentic moms Mexican food I've ever tasted! I had a chicken & pork enchilada with salsa verse drizzled all over just like I like it. & surprisingly the beans which are bland at most Mexican restaurants, were very tasty. Five stars for really yummy not your average Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I don't think I would describe this as authentic as much as what Americans expect for a  Mexican restaurant, but it is very 'Fiesta!!!\"  in decor, with lots of tile, colors, booths and tables that can be put together for groups and large families.  Chips and sauces/slaw provided.  We've eaten here many times over the years.  Good value.  Portions are huge.  Table side guacamole is good.  Near the airport and a good place to  have a quick meal with friends who have a 2-3 hour layover."}
{"text":"I LOVE AZTECA!! It's a definite on Cinco De Mayo this place is packed and the Margaritas are HUGE!!! 

I love the hot fresh chips and they're salsa is good too!! I think this place is better than Cantina and it's definitely more authentic! I always get the same thing its a dish with shrimp and vegetables with rice and cheese sooooo good!!

The value that you get in unbelievable for 2 people it ends up to be $17 can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Shady location but amazing food and service. Live music was very good. Makes you think you really are in Mexico or Cozumel! Bring your family and friends you won't be disappointed. One negative is parking is really limited"}
{"text":"I always feel like I'm on vacation when I'm here! Such a fun atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"When someone at work says \"Mexican for lunch?\" They can always count me in!

My coworkers and I arrived a little after before noon and the parking lot was already packed. I was pleased that even though the lot was full there was no wait and we were seated immediately. 

No sooner than we sat down we had a basket of chips and two different salsas. I really liked their salsa. I wasn't a fan of the chips because they were not served up hot but I ate them anyway because the salsa was just that good. Spicy and delicious...just like I like it. 

The menu had great variety and the prices were excellent! I ordered the Deluxe Taco Salad with chicken - It comes in a tortilla shell with tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. 

Our food arrived so freaking fast! My goodness! What a major win for the very hungry lunch crowd! 

My salad was just okay. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means and the portion size was not a problem. It was the tortilla shell. It was not crispy like I'm used too but that's just my personal preference. I still loaded it up with salsa and enjoyed every bite.  

For the prices this place is a great deal for lunch. I'd definitely come back, there's so much more I have to try...See ya soon Azteca!"}
{"text":"Girl's Night Out= Mexican Night! Oh yeah!!! 

Azteca's always a good choice! The margaritas are big and strong ( as they should be) and the food is solid every time. I ordered a taco salad with chicken. It was a good dinner, we had a great time and if I'm in the area I'd stop here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a scam! 
Even though they are busy, the quality of food is below par. We went there tonight for end of year celebration. We ordered a deluxe burrito and a paella Mexicana. 
The beef burrito was small and salty. 
The seafood in the paella was not fresh. They seemed to be frozen seafood. The mussels were rotten. The rice had a strange sour taste. Just disgusting for a $21 paella. 
Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Has been awhile but need to return more often. The waiters and staff Are wonderful will return again. Ole"}
{"text":"Growing up six miles from the Mexican border, I'm convinced \"authentic\" to me is not what others consider \"authentic\"! 
 
For being in North Carolina, thousands of miles from the border, this is pretty darn authentic by my standards!
  
It's a Sunday afternoon and the place is packed with hispanic families!  That's an automatic one star for me!!!  This usually means the food will be more homemade type Mexican food and less commercial like you would get at a Carlos O'Kelley's type place.  Then the guacamole cart comes around and fresh guacamole is made at your table!!  And BAM!  There's three stars!  The guacamole was AMAZING!!!  You get to pick all of the ingredients as well as how spicy you would like it.  

Then our orders of chile verde, a heaping ceviche (complete w Tapatio) and a combo plate of an enchilada and avocado tostada comes out just as we finish the guacamole!  Four stars!!!  The food is delicious, the wait staff is helpful and prompt.  Just when we realized we couldn't stuff out faces with one more bite, out came a perfect-sized portion of buenelos type dessert with strawberry sauce FOR FREE!!!!  And before you know it we are at FIVE STARS!  

We ate at El Charo in the same area a couple of nights ago and they don't come close to Azteca!!!  So ignore all of the stars El Charo got and go to AZTECA!!!!"}
{"text":"Best shredded beef and fajitas i have found. Great atmosphere, fabulous service and i always leave happy."}
{"text":"Subpar to say the least... Definitely won't be eating here ever again. Very bland food. Blah."}
{"text":"Their nachos tasted like shit and i didn't even know that was possible. It was also expensive. Just stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Good meal tonight at Azteca.  This is our go to for good Mexican food.  Unlimited chips and salsa keep coming to the table.  The servings are large, so you won't go hungry. I like that they have the daily specials on display in the waiting area.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Seriously some damn good food here.  The place looks like a total crapfest from the outside, especially being right there at a hotel in a dubious neighborhood, but trust me, once you go in the weird doors (the entrance always seems like it's in a transitional state of construction) you'll feel like you just discovered a hidden gem!

The not-so-good: If you're not with a large group, I recommend asking for a booth, because they tend to crowd the tables a little close.  Sometimes it feels like they're pushing you to join another party the way the tables get too close.  And then there's the waiters... I've gone here dozens of times, and at least 75% of the time I've had a weird waiter ogle me.  Even when I've gone with my father! They can be kinda shameless. Wear a turtleneck if it'll bother you that much.

And then there's the good.. which far outweighs the negatives: Their food is freakin' amazing, and plentiful!  Expect to get a big basket of warm chips & salsas as soon as you sit down.. They'll keep filling that up as soon as it empties, but save room for the meal- the food is the star here! Their shredded beef is spiced perfectly. (Most dishes come with ground beef, but they will upgrade if you ask - and it's a million times better!)  I love their flautas, and their enchiladas. (I'm a sucker for a good enchilada!)  I highly recommend their enchiladas suizas (green sauce and cheese- really really good).  There's really nothing bad on the menu, ever. And no matter what you order, their portion sizes are huge!  

Don't feel bad about being too full for dessert.. they'll still bring you a little sopapilla with strawberry sauce & whipped cream with your check! It's the perfect little ending to a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican style food. Didn't know the price of my drinks, but they were well worth it. Had a great lunch...I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Absolute worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Carnitas burrito, the carnitas.. so bland and looked boiled.  The burrito itself was covered in some red sauce that reminded me of canned kids pasta sauce.  The sprinkling of shredded cheddar on top really put me off as well.  

The salsa for the chips was the same red sauce with some onions and cilantro.  Flavorless, worthless.  This place sucks"}
{"text":"Working in Charlotte for a month. Stayed very close to Azteca and we couldn't stay away from this place it was good the 4 times we visited! I have been to a good 25+ mexican restaurants back at home in NYC and plenty in Texas, this by far the best I've had. 

Would definitely recommend, come hungry they have combo diners that are huge plates. Will need to be rolled out when your done eating lol. A+"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food.  Actually not all that exciting.  The burrito chicken is a little rough, though the other parts of the burrito/meal (cheese/wrap/guac/beans/rice) helped make up for that.

Also they gave out chips and salsa at the beginning and a cinnamon chip at the end, so that was nice.

All in all, ok."}
{"text":"This place is hustling and bustling when we first got here - always a great sign during lunch. I came here with coworkers and we were promptly seated. Chips were provided with salsa and a pico type topping. The lunch specials from 11-3 on weekdays were amazing. I ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were cooked well and it was very tasty. 

Will return."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas burrito. Was not expecting it to be in the Day's Inn but it smelled amazing so don't let that throw you off,"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with very large portions! I have never seen so much food in my life! The fresh guacamole made table side was delicious. They also had some different things that you don't normally see at Mexican restaurants such as a salsa/pico slaw with the chips and salsa and also a slaw with the combination plates. They also have a free cinnamon tortilla chip with whipped cream and strawberry at the end! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to have dinner here at least 3 times a month, but the last couple of times have really let us down. The very last visit was it for me. The food quality is horrible and they try to make up for it with huge portions. I ordered a dish with steak and they asked how I'd like it cooked. I requested rare but when it arrived it was well done. The rest of the meal was just as disappointing, so do yourself a favor and pass this place by."}
{"text":"Rip off. You must specify \"the margarita on special\" they advertise a drink special, you ask for that drink, they bring you the bigger version and charge you that price. When questioned, I was told there was no special. It's on the website and their board at the entrance. Manager no help. Says he'll talk to bartender to make sure it doesn't happen again. No offer to refund the additional money charged. Food definitely isn't worth all the trouble."}
{"text":"The first impression was a good one.  The host led us to our table and I couldn't help but notice the murals of Aztec leaders and ancient designs painted on the walls.  The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.  

The salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.

The ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite 'dirty' mexican restaurant. I say that meaning the type of mom & pop Mexican place you think of with the combo meals that have a variety of things with rice and beans.... not your \"upscale\" mexican like Cantina. 

Food is always good, and comes out pipping hot! Huge portions, and they have a great little patio area for the nicer weather months! Parking is a little weird though, most of it is back by this sketchy motel."}
{"text":"During lunchtime. Very good. Chicken soup some of the best I have ever had. The pico great also."}
{"text":"Worst experience 

After waiting for an hour we left, the team is giving priority to friends 

Very upsetting and disappointing"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant
the fajitas were fantastic
the waiter was wonderful
Loved the band
Great atmosphere
thanks"}
{"text":"Food was not even close to being authentic Mexican.  I have never had mexican topped with cheddar cheese.  We had 3 people in our party and they gave us 1 very small bowl of salsa and when we asked for another one we were told there would be a charge.  Terrible food and service and kinda pricy.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! Yes, they seat you quickly, but the menus were thrown on the table and the server just left. Didn't ask if we wanted a drink or anything. They actually didn't say a word to us. The waiter took forever to serve us and never came to check on us to see if we wanted or needed anything else. I really wish I could have gotten his name, but maybe it helps for the establishment to know that we visited on 2/25/2017 around 8:30pm and sat directly across from the kitchen. When the waiter finally came back we asked for the check and waited a long time again for him to come back to the table. We were ready to leave and late for a meeting with some other people, so we decided to go to the counter to pay, but wow, he sure was quick that time to come to our table to tell us to pay at the table after waiting a lifetime for him to show up! Apparently, he thought we were trying to leave without paying! I was livid and have never been treated like that before! Good Lord! We didn't want to spend the night there! 
     I came here upon recommendation from some of our employees who like to eat here, but it is definitely not a place I care to ever visit again and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone that I know. We were treated like dirt! It doesn't help that it is also located in a sketchy part of town. The only thing good I can say about this place is that the food was OK. 
     If you are interested in great tasting Mexican food in a better area with better service, try Salsas in Steele Creek. Better service, better & safer location and a more pleasant staff. There are also many things to do nearby that you can walk to, safely."}
{"text":"I have yet to find any amazing Mexican in the Charlotte area, but Azteca was pretty darn good. The atmosphere is really fun and inviting with all of the decor of a Mexican joint. The waitstaff is all dressed like bull riders and a man comes by with a fresh guacamole cart if you want some. The chips and salsa were great and plentiful. We also got the cheese dip which didn't disappoint. The chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco were both very good. The meat was clearly fresh. I was disappointed with the chile relleno. My boyfriend loved his food (we got the same thing). They give you a little free dessert thing at the end which is a nice added touch. The service was amazing and fast!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican spots which is pretty consistent. Their chips are hot and salsa is pretty good,  I really like the fact that the queso ( white cheese dip) comes in a bowl size fit for sharing. For ex, Cabo's comes in an ittybitty  small as a finger bowl. It  is $5, plus it too runny for me. Anyway, Azteca's servers have always been attentive and quick for our needs. The food is reasonably priced and portions are nice.  He loves the chicken and shrimp fajitas and I really like the Pollo Poblano. Here, it is just right &  not too sweet like some other spots."}
{"text":"Brought some out of town friends here last night. Got to the restaurant around 7:10 or 7:20.  Waiter was so in-attentive it was embarrassing. It took forever to get water, then drinks, then refills. Most Mexican places serve your food so quickly you barely have a chance to enjoy a basket of chips. We went through 4 baskets and waited an hour for our food, keep in mind I took forever to get chip refills. 

I like to think I have appropriate expectations for food quality and service on a $10 meal but this was terrible. This was our 2nd time here and we won't go back!  Waiter was very rude and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"Love love....love Azteca. Their made to order Guac is the best.  
    I've eaten here quite a few times throughout the years and have yet to be disappointed. Their Carne Asada is delectable as well as the Arroz con Pollo. 
    I highly recommend the margaritas too!
Azteca is great for large groups because of it's lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I give this a 5 star for a Mexican restaurant that you don't have to speak Spanish in order to eat here. Being part Latino, I'm used to a little more traditional style of cooking and  Azteca does not disappoint. 
As far as the Guacamole, let me just say that my boyfriend will not touch the stuff at other places or at home but LOVED Azteca's. I have to admit, it was better than my mothers, and that says a lot. It is pricey for Guacamole but well worth it. If all you eat here is this then you're far ahead of other Mexican restaurants. 
I usually eat Arroz con Pollo or Carnitas which are always great. On my most recent visit I had the Carne Asada. IT WAS HEAVEN! The carne was juicy and very flavorful and the mixed grilled vegetables were a nice surprise compared to what other places give you. 
The ambiance is great and I don't think they have a single unattractive waitress there. The bar is a good place to start as it's in the center of the back part of the restaurant and they make a frozen margarita that is Muy Deliciouso!!! 

Only gripe.......it's not close enough to my house!"}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my friends birthday, and they didn't even come to our table but once. It seemed like they completely forgot about us. No celebrations were had, not even a \"Happy Birthday\""}
{"text":"Ordered the taco and enchilada lunch special with rice and beans. The food had no seasoning and was flavorless. The chips were served with salsa which was OK. Service was good. Probably won't come back here again and will head to La Unica or Monterrey in the future. The decor was nice inside but didn't make up for the disappointing, bland fare."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best fajitas, very flavorful! Also, the staff treats you like family. Best Mexican restaurant I have been to by far!"}
{"text":"The pros:

- Good service.  The hostess was friendly and seated me promptly.  Though my friend hadn't arrived yet, there was no prob to get a table and wait at the the table.  Throughout dinner our server was courteous and quick.  We also had, who I think is a manager, check on us a couple of times, and made sure we were ok.

- Fresh guac - As Dave S. pointed out (and thank you for the rec on this place!) there's a guy that goes table to table and offers fresh guac.  We sampled a bit and really liked it, so he served us a fresh bowl of it.  It's creamy, fresh, and very good!

- Basket of tortilla chips and salsa - The tortilla chips are right out of the oven, and are warm & crispy to perfection.  They serve them with a small bowl of salsa and a small plate of salad.  It took a lot of self control to not inhale the whole thing!

The cons:

- Few vegetarian/vegal options - The menu only has about three things to select if you're vegetarian and/or vegan.  Also my cheese enchillada was very bland and was brought out without any sauce on it, which was kind of odd.  I've had cheese enchilladas at so many other Mexican restaurants and they always serve it with salsa verde or standard red salsa, in this case I had to ask for a side bowl of red salsa.

- Mariachi Band - Ok, they're not a total \"negative\" but it was a little distracting having them blast their music at our table right when my friend showed up.  We hadn't seen each other in 2 years and were ready to catch up but all we could do was shout at each other b/c the band chose to perform right at our table.  As soon as we answered their request of what type of song to play, and they played a good chearful piece, and after we tipped them, they left, then we could actually eat and talk without raising our voices.  But the music was good and they were a nice group, so it's not all bad, just not great timing on their part.

Verdict:

I'd probably go back here if I was in the area, but not likely to go out of my way."}
{"text":"Tucked away near Northlake Mall, you can find yourself some pretty good Mexican food. Fellow Elite friends recommended Azteca, and it was a hit! The food was delicioso -- good chips, great tacos, your choice of black beans or refried beans with your meal, and excellent rice as a side. Good drink selection and fair prices. Nice but not huge outdoor seating area. Great service and friendly staff. Obviously popular with the families, but don't rule it out if you're younger and unattached! This is definitely a good option when you're in the area and jonesin' for a quesadilla and margarita."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but I always have a good time when I come here! (Go on Fridays. That's when the mariachi band comes :D) A little after we were seated, the mariachi band came over to our table. They asked if they could play a song for us. OF COURSE YOU CAN!! But umm.. we didn't know what song to request so we asked for a \"happy\" song haha (I guess I should brush up on my latin songs beforehand next time lol) They were so sweet! Near the end of our meal, they came back to ask if we would like another. Of course we said YES! Don't forget to tip btw :)

There was a birthday party beside us and the servers embarrass the birthday girl/boy with a sombrero hat as the mariachi band gathers with birthday songs :) It is a great place for birthdays. The space isn't that big, but they can accommodate large crowds. Plus, being here always makes me more cheery!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing Mexican food. The special menu has real Mexican food, just like you get in Mexico. (Not the American version of Mexican food) The staff was super friendly and actually knew the best food to order. Get the guacamole made at your table, it's incredible. All in all I will make Azteca a stop for lunch or dinner every time I'm in the area!! Fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Charlotte, NC seems to have a problem (at least in my part of town) with Mexican restaurants that have decided to go upscale and charge you too much for the simple dishes we all know and love.  Azteca hasn't gone this route at all.  In fact its basically in the lobby of a Days Inn.  Thank you for protecting what Mexican food really is Azteca."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with my Father, my wife and kids.  The waitress did a great job.

I had the Baja Fish Tacos.  Excellent! 

My 5 year old had the chicken fingers and they were very good as well.

For some reason it was very smokey the whole time. Perhaps their kitchen draft hood was having issues.

We will  be back."}
{"text":"The best advice I can give you is watch your account if you pay by debit or credit. An extra $1 was added to my purchase when I looked online. I guess they figured most people wouldn't notice. Of course  $1 is no big deal, but it's the principle of it that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Not to mention bad business practice. 

The food itself was pretty good, but the portion size wasn't particularly the best. I am a big fan of chicken fajitas, so I already anticipate restaurants putting more onions and peppers than anything. But here they put a VERY little amount of chicken. Much less than any other place I have been to."}
{"text":"Impressively consistent poor service.  Been there 12 times but the tasty guacamole and carne asada can only distract me for so long before I break! They are downright mean and lazy.  Go to Don Pedro.  Same corporate owners and recipes but better staff.  'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Ok so we were refried bean boozled!!!! My husband usually doesn't complain BUT tonight he had a whole lot to say! The wait wouldn't have been so horrible if we actually had somewhere to wait. 

Got seated at our table and served cold stale tortilla chips, but the guacamole made table side was good.
Didn't get our drinks until about 12 mins later after being seated ( who doesn't give free refills on shirley temples anymore?) Food came out and it wasn't worth the wait! 

Don't know how they received the 4 star rating I really don't see how this qualifies as such."}
{"text":"Visited Azteca for a birthday celebration on Cinco De Mayo which means it was super packed and busy.  We waited almost an hour for our table.  The service was really not that great.  We had to ask for things multiple times and gave up after they never gave us hot sauce.  On the flip side, the food is cheap, with many entrees less than $10 that will more than stuff any person, so that really cancels out the bad service.  All in all, it was OK.  I've been to the one on Woodlawn and had a much better service experience, but maybe it was different because it was on Cinco De Mayo.

You can get a \"free t-shirt\" with a margarita, but the margarita is $11 which is more than most entrees, so it's really not that great of a deal, but still fun."}
{"text":"It's ok. Tables are half the size of an average restaurant table. I guess they did this to maximize space within the restaurant. The beans and rice were very, very good.  Also, a bit pricy."}
{"text":"Our group of 8 ladies really enjoyed dinner on August 19th at 6:00pm. I ordered the Chimmichanga with shredded beef, came with re-fried beans with cheese and rice. It was steaming hot & very good. All  our dinners were served within 10 minutes which I thought was great with all the various orders. Our waiter was most pleasant despite a few confused \"seniors' in our group! It was my 1st time here and at the end of dinner, he brought 2 small plates with sophapias with strawberry glaze and a dollop of whipped cream that was delicious. Great little extra to top the dinner off. 

I will return!"}
{"text":"My shrimp ceviche was enormous and very good. Service was great, everyone made sure I enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Great service n good lunch choices
Very little wait time til you receive your meal
Cheerful n friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"I wasn't even in the mood for Mexican. I just needed a place to grab dinner near my hotel on a national holiday, and this place fit the bill. Wow - it is surprisingly good! Charming decor, good service, really fantastic carne asada. So happy that my hotel is way over on this side of town and that I stumbled across this place. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Glad I looked at Yelp first. Staying nearby for a couple of nights. Read the good reviews and decided to try it. Granted, it was late on a week nite but the service was excellent. I had the chorizo burrito which was fantastic. I don't see chorizo served at a lot of Mexican restaurants. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"Clase, lo dice:

Buenos Dias.

Me llamo Daniela.

Como esta usted.

Quiero comer en Azteca.

Quiero comer en Azteca todos los dias.

Okay, maybe not todos los dias because I would be as big as una casa but frequently. I am a seafood enchilada junkie and they are not a common in charlotte as I would have thought. Azteca serves up a mighty delicioso set of two Enchiladas de Camaron with an 18-wheeler's worth of rice and beans (the tasty ones, not the ones that taste can-y). Add the standard basket of chips and salsa, but with pico de galo and additional hot salsa (you may have to ask) and complimentary sopapillas and you are bound to be both happy and unbuttoning sus pantalones when you leave.

Does it have a hint of standard American Mexican restaurant to it? Si. But its tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"I suppose there are both pros and cons in having a pretty solid Mexican restaurant right up the road from your home. The obvious pro being the accessibility to great food and drink (generally Dos Equis or Modelo for me), followed swiftly by the obvious con of un-doing your exercise routine for the day. 

But in any case, I generally enjoyed this restaurant with the exception of cost. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't necessarily pricey. It is generally comparable to other Mexican restaurants. For me, if I'm looking for a quick, around-the-corner Mexican restaurant- this is definitely the place to be. If I'm looking to penny-pinch, I'd drive a few minutes down WT Harris towards the university and hit up Zapatas (my absolute fan favorite). 

I generally liked every other aspect of this establishment. The atmosphere and décor were set perfectly for a Mexican restaurant. Good ambiance. The food was well prepared and was pretty delectable. Beer was flowing. The service was spot on. What more can you ask for really? 

There were specials here, which most looked appealing. 

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place, it is off the beaten track, which means no waiting, and the noise level is low.  The food is delishly, outstanding, I love it all (except for refried beans, I don't like refried beans is why).  The vegetable are fresh and and the food is served piping hot, nothing sits under a heat lamp.  The wait staff is very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Azteca a few times, but this review is about our most recent visit on a Thursday night. When you pull up, it usually leaves people scratching their head as it is next to a days inn that has seen better days. However, don't be deterred! I've seen other yelpers tag it as \"dirty Mexican\", which is what my wife and I jokingly call it as well. What you get is a pretty authentic experience with some really simple and delicious Mexican food (think meat, rice, beans, sauce). 

We pulled in late (~10 PM) to grab a quick dinner and ended up sitting outside on the patio. They have a decent drink menu to go along with their expansive food menu (also be sure to check out the menu full of photographs for a few kicks) and I ended up getting a 32 oz sugar creek pale ale that was on special - I soon realized my mistake when the massive glass hit the table as I don't do math well (almost 3 beers!) after 10 PM. We ended up splitting a fajitas plate as the portions are huge and even I couldn't finish one myself. 

The staff is always super friendly. I had flashbacks to our travels to central america as the waiter's common responses come in Spanish and he tolerated/helped me with my poor broken Spanish. There is a bit of a culture gap here, so you may have to work to get your bill. I ended up closing up at the front due to the late hour and they were closing down. 

All in all - a fun place to go and grab a simple but tasty meal!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Really great service and the food was delicious! Would recommend the chicken fajita quesadilla and the coco margarita! Both were soooo good!"}
{"text":"Stopped here because it was close to our hotel, very glad we did!  First things first, the staff.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly young lady, and then every member of the staff we walked past on the way to our table said hello.  It is a big comfortable restaurant, very simply done.  The menu is large, something for everyone's taste.  Our sever was with us immediately and we had our drinks in minutes.  Complimentary chips and salsa (with pink chips) were very good!  We both ordered a taco salad and it did not disappoint!  Large portion of ground beef in a tasty shell!  Our beverages never went below half, and as a plate was finished, it was removed.  I couldn't leave without trying the flan, another excellent choice!  We left feeling full and had two drinks, chips and salsa, two taco salads, and a dessert for less than $24.  As we were leaving, every member of the staff we walked by said goodbye and thanked us.  In a time when it is difficult to have employees pay attention to you (because they are on their phones or talking to each other), that was definitely not the case here!  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but I sat at the bar and my service was terrible. I had to ask for chips and salsa 3 times. I got my food before my chips. I asked them to make fajitas spicy and for some reason it was sweet? WTF?
I asked for hot sauce and did not get it, until a waiter that was cashing out noticed and brought it to me. I tipped that waiter that who was nice enough to take care of me 5 times more than my actual waiter."}
{"text":"Good value and service.  Fajita order was easily shareable and a bargain at $12.95.  Burrito wasn't huge but good flavor.  Chips were  very good.  Seemed more substantial than most places. Would  go back again based on the price."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I come here often. The dishes are large and there is always some leftover to take home. I always order the Mexican stir fry which is chicken and lots of mixed veggies. My girlfriend always gets different dishes and I eat off her plate. The staff is friendly, the beer is always cold and the music is lively. We always end with fried ice cream. I love love love my fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Feels like home.. no, not Mexico! California!

Very authentic Mexican style food. Love the salsa and the tableside guac. My enchilada suizas plate was HUGE. Really tasty and the people who work there are so sweet.

It's connected to a Days Inn - so can look kinda shady, but its definitely a family place you can go for a huge margarita and some yummy Mexican food."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 in town for an event on Friday night. Found this place for dinner on Thursay and everybody was glad we did! First it is the real deal, the staff could not have been better. Everyone's meal came out together and was great. Did I mention that it was a terrific value because it sure was. If you have the opportunity to stop in do it."}
{"text":"Not your mom's arroz con pollo.  But a suitable alternative.  Nice variety on the menu if you are looking for a little more than your typical Mexican favs."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here once a week and occasionally twice. Prices can't be beat - particularly the lunch specials - and the quality is always excellent. Great service and excellent value for the money. Azteca's food is always delicious - I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in the 5+ years I've been frequenting the place."}
{"text":"Hmmm, well here this goes....

For starters, very fancy beautiful, colorful restaurant. Fast paced and steadily busy from what I see. 

I've been here a few times.  The menu is huge with selections /dishes. The downside from this place in comparison to other Mexican restaurants is this place is pricey on their menu. I can get the same quality of dishes for lesser price somewhere else. 

With that being said, they have some of the best Queso in the area!!!. They serve you a huge bowl for $5.50. I am particular over salsa. I personally enjoyed theirs. It's full of onions, cilantro and peppers drowning in a garlicky tomato puree. My husband didn't quite like but he's no fan of onions as I am. The Chips are just ok. 

The service was decent,  no complaints.  

I may return someday when I forget that I don't like the flavor of their steak or the Tostado soup was not chicken broth tasty. For presentation. It looked awesome! The taste just didn't sit well with me. Maybe on a Queso quest, I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"A defining trait of a good Mexican restraint can be found in their salsa. This salsa falls short, tasting like tomato soup with some chopped onions in it. And if you find yourself not a fan of this watery red liquid, well to bad. Because, you are about to see that exact red sauce on every plate that comes out. That's right, enchiladas covered in the \"salsa\" , burritos drenched, fajitas swimming in it....they put it on everything with a shameless pride. Also beware Saturday nights, it is Spanish karaoke night, and the music \"horns mostly\" are turned up to ear splitting levels. A request to turn it down and be able to hear the person across the table, will be met with a smile and an \"okay\" without any results. Send three people and it'll still be a smile and an \"okay\" ...which is how I would feel if the manager came up and asked me how my meal was. (Smile) \"it's okay\""}
{"text":"Service here is not good at all. I came Tuesday evening at 9pm with a friend and we wanted some good Mexican food. We got greeted fine and sat close to the bar area and a older gentleman tried to take care of us. The aguas frescas were ok. We put in an order right away because we were really hungry and waited more than 45 minutes for the tres Amigos plate. We just decided to leave because we stayed hungry the whole time. No extra chips or salsa were given to us. Do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Me and my sister go here for her birthday it is authentic and fresh, my favorite salsa pico salsa, once you have tasted here you will never go back to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here Friday for dinner. I had the small portion of their chicken fajitas it was ok. The service was also ok I can say that they have good chips and salsa. I'll be coming back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Azteca is suprisingly a great place to take a huge group for lunch.  They're speedy, you can call ahead and reserve a giant table, and they don't complain too much about haveing 20 seperate checks.

I normally order something small off the lunch menu, because I inevitably fill myself up with chips and salsa before my lunch even comes.  I always save room for the desert at the end!

Pro tip: if you're trying to get out of Azteca to head towards Billy Graham, go out the back of the parking lot to come out at the light.  Making a left onto Woodlawn is just plain crazy."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Great bartenders and servers. Muy delicioso! The shop is conveniently located. Lots of good choices for the beer and a good margarita if you'd like. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came into town to do some shopping. Ate hear because we love, love mexican, however they charge for chips and salsa after 2 baskets, they don't put cheese dip/sauce on anything without an upcharge. Even normal dishes that should have it. Because let's be honest that is the best part about mexican food. The chimichangas and rice where dry. It was also really expensive for mexican. $15-$20 a plate. Not ideal for the mexican food I was served. I'm not bashing, just trying to help out fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Azteca for over 10 years and they never disappoint.  This is as authentic as Mexican cuisine gets ,as I know, in Charlotte. I have tried to go to other peoples go to spots and they just don't compare to the amount of flavor that Azteca has. They offer you salsa, slaw, and chips with each meal. The choices they have are endless. You cant go wrong with anything that comes with their refried beans and rice, it is LIFE. Margaritas are great. Its my tradition to come here every cinco de mayo (get their early, its everybody else's idea too), but they always have shirts with a margarita purchase every cinco de mayo and it makes the experience that much more fun. They end your meal with a little sweet dessert of a fried cinnamon chip."}
{"text":"My first meal at this restaurant was sitting at the bar.  I had the shrimp fajitas and enjoyed them tremendously. Flavor was great. The service is very attentive at the bar.

We went back the same week and had the shrimp fajitas again.  Again I really enjoyed them.

Then we went again a couple of days ago and shared the chicken nachos.  There was plenty of chicken for both of us.  The flavors all worked together.  There was a good balance of all ingredients including cheese, guac and sour cream."}
{"text":"Want some chicken soup to brighten your day?  They got it and you should, too.  Very good and oh, so much chicken.  Azteca has also a wide variety of Mexican food and is more than your average \"chicken, rice, and beans\" joint.  I think their food is done well.  Best Mexican ever?  No.  That doesn't exist in Charlotte.

About the only thing I dislike is their parking--very crowded (and yes, weird parking at the motel).  Other than that, I say \"give 'em a whirl!\""}
{"text":"The arroz pon collo was a great dish! The plates full of chicken and veggies to fill you up! Make sure to ask for the soft shells to go with it!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time I been here. I feel like if you're looking for authentic Mexican than this is the place. At one point in the past, they have a station in the restaurant in the front that they make tortillas from scratch. But since they gotten soo popular and demand is high that it's impossible to make it from scratch up front. 

I ordered the shrimp fajitas with corn tortillas. I really really like it.. The green and red peppers with the onions were perfect. The shrimps was not overcooked and plenty of it.. Corn tortillas came warm.. My company ordered chicken fajitas and 3 beef hard shell tacos. They finished their meal and smiling so I'm assuming it must be good. We were starving so there wasn't much talking at all. 

The gentleman that was waiter did his job. Did his thing! I wouldn't say he was on top of thing but he manage.. But he wasn't bad either!! 

Overall I would love to go back and try a few more things on the menu. But knowing me, I'll get the shrimp fajitas again!"}
{"text":"Great service, big portions, affordable prices. I love the queso and enchiladas! My go to mexican spot in North CLT."}
{"text":"The food here is great. There is a Mariachi band that plays Friday nights that is really fun! But don't waste your money on a pitcher of margaritas. They are not very strong, and very sugary! Probably go for a single top shelf margarita if you do!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate the tacos here and were very disappointed. The soft shell tacos seemed to have been dipped in oil. They had grease dripping off of them. The meat in the tacos weren't very good either. The ambiance was nice though. The waiters were very friendly."}
{"text":"Basic boring Tex Mex, but hey the place was packed. They know what brings them in, so who am I to judge.  

There were some nice touches that bring it up a notch or two over similar restaurants - generous use of cilantro, pickled onions and cactus salad with the carnitas - but they were negated by the over cooked carnitas meat, packaged corn tortillas and tasteless Huevos Rancheros. 

The restaurant itself is huge and colorfully appointed; service is very good. The bill for lunch was very inexpensive. Despite everything this is actually one of the better choices around Northlake; but that says more about the dearth of good dining options in that area."}
{"text":"This Mexican food is absolutely AMAZING. I had to scoop up my brains off the floor and put them in a doggie bag because my mind was blown. My assumption is there is an underground grow room with avocado trees as the table side magician making the guacamole has the freshest avocados ever to be grown. Post guacamole heaven we moved on to the entrees. I honestly don't even know how to put this into words. I ordered the deluxe burrito with rice and refried beans. \"Deluxe\" is the biggest understatement I've ever heard. This is the mac daddy Mercedes Benz shut your freaking mouth and say \"ah\" burrito. Chicken beans rice tortilla salsa sour cream guac tomatoes lettuce all checks across the board. Lastly let me say the house margarita with salt on the rim is like Jose Cuervos gift to man to enjoy with a meal suitable for the last supper. Azteca, I love you, and I will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Even after reading the positive reviews for Azteca I was still a little hesitant walking into the place. I have dissonance around finding a good restaurant attached to a mid-range hotel. 

When you walk in, it's like walking in a little tunnel. The front area is really small too and if you arrive with a lot of people, your personal space bubble becomes almost non-existent. We asked for a booth and yes, the tables are very close together. The staff are friendly and they especially warm-up if you speak Spanish. 

We ordered the \"Macho\" and veggie fajitas. Very good and large portions! We also ordered the fresh guacamole since many of the previous reviews raved about this. Even though it was delicious, I thought it was a tad pricey ($7 for one avocado) after thinking it was only $3 (I guess I mis-read the menu). The salsa was on the watery side and I'm accustomed to the chunkier, but it was still good. 

As we were leaving, a table was having a birthday and it was such a fun site to see! Most of the staff came out singing and sombreros in hand. At the end of the birthday song, one of the waiters got up on a chair and was pretending to do a little strip-tease with his apron. Hilarious. 

Good food, good fun...and if you are lucky, you'll witness a birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good for Mexican food in the south.  Salsa was good, tacos were soggy, tamale was good, service was fine."}
{"text":"I am a Mexican food groupie it is one of my favorite things to eat I have had it many places and Azteca is the best.  The guacamole is delectable made fresh table side avocados, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, lime, onion, and jalapeño. The chips, salsa, and pico are free and always tasty as well. I have tried many of the dishes offered and my favorites Arroz con pollo, Fajitas, Taco Salad, Tamels and the super burrito. The Spanish rice and beans are scrumptious. It is pretty much always busy at Azteca but weekends expect a wait how ever on weekends they have the fresh corn tortilla stand open and they make them fresh to order yum! Service is hit or miss depending on who you get and how busy it is last night for example it wasn't super busy but our server was very slow it took 20 minutes to get the check after I asked for a to go box. Lastly if you want a fun place to celebrate a birthday this is it they have a huge sombrero and
A full band including a guitar to sing to you and make you feel extra special. I love everything about the food here and I think you should try it!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada in town and lets don't  start talking about their handmade tortillas ... Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice space, BUT they do a TERRIBLE job at handling large reservations. Twice in the last year, they accepted our reservation for a group of 20-30 people, then when we showed up (on time, both times) they said very plainly and unapologetically that they had decided to give ALL of our reserved tables to other groups before we arrived. They didn't offer any solution other than  just waiting, and for 20-30 people, that meant waiting for at least an extra hour. So if you have a large group, don't bother trying to make a reservation here; and if you do, don't fool yourself into thinking not means anything."}
{"text":"The food and service are spectacular. I would drive to Latin America to experience it all again. The fajitas were spot on, and the margharitas were enormous and delicious. At least 5 different servers asked if I needed anything and did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for my food. Also free chips and salsa. Will come back next time I am in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing to write home about.
Dining room is tight... booths are only fit for thin people and even then it's a tight squeeze.
Food is overly greasy, salsa is watery, chips are mediocre and limited.
I really do not see what the big deal is about this place... it's decent, but nothing to rave about.
The best thing about the place is the fast service.
You could do better... you could do worse, but  you owe it to yourself to try some place different if you believe Azteca is \"great\" or even \"above average\"."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love this place?! COME ON! Ok, well I could live without the salsa, but the pico is ooooooh so good. I also dig that they offer Sol beer which is not easy to come by. I admit, I am not one to order the same thing every time I go out to eat, but I just cant stay away from the arroz con pollo. ARRRRRIBA! Take a bunch of amigos/amigas and enjoy a margarita or two and eat up...then go home with the leftovers. My guy and I had leftovers and I made a freakin casserole with them for god sakes. So much food!"}
{"text":"I had great service at Azteca but I was not really impressed with the food or the prices. It's very expensive for a Mexican restaurant. You are guaranteed to spend more than $10 per meal. The chips and salsa were good but they gave us two little tiny bowls of the salsa and that's it. No refills on chips no refills on salsa. We had a group of 4 which included two big boys that obviously could kill the salsa in two bites so I didn't even get to have any. Bummer. Then everything was so expensive I tried getting the cheapest thing. I wasn't impressed with mine considering it was still around $14. Just an okay experience at Azteca. We won't be back. There are many options for great Mexican food in the area that are more suitable for our price range."}
{"text":"So I have to update my previous review from a 4 to a 2 and echo what a lot of other reviewers are experiencing - what the hell happened, Azteca?  While they have updated and spruced up the interior, quite honestly the food is not as good as it used to be and the newer staff needs some more training.

I know I am a fatty, but if I come in at 11:30 am, I expect lunch portions and lunch prices.  On a Thursday visit, I did get an extra flauta (I thought the menu changed, I didn't realize the waitress had done a dinner order), however that was not a good thing.  The flautas used to be crispy with well flavored meat.  The shell for mine was mushy instead of crunchy and the beef was dry, tough and flavorless.  For $7.25 I would have been irritated enough - for $10, I was kind of pissed.  The rice and beans are the same eh, fine, they have always been, cheese dip was good.  The chips tasted different and not in a good way.  I don't eat the salsa, so I can't speak to that.

I did see a several people that have been there forever, but I did see a lot of new faces too.  From the other \"meh\" reviews and my past two experiences, I do believe I will be heading to 1900 for Mexican lunches and Monterrey for dinner - Azteca just isn't cutting it anymore."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found this spot as it was near our hotel.  The exterior was a little underwhelming, but the dining room is very inviting, cute bar area, and very friendly staff.  The bottomline is the food though, and it was excellent.  The house Margaritas are good, and our entrees were all very good, an excellent value for a mid-range priced restaurant of this type.  If it was located in Minneapolis it would be in our regular rotation.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 8-March-2017
Time of my visit: Lunch

My co-worker took me to this joint.  It was busy!  I like and hate busy.  It was a 10 minute wait and we were seated.

The server came over almost immediately and took our drink order.  Shortly there after we ordered.  I ordered burrito deluxe, it came with rice and beans.

It did not take long for the food to come out.  I was slightly disappointed with a portion (sorry for not taking a picture).  It had to be one of the weirdest burrito experience ever for me...  What I was expecting to be inside (lettuce, cheese, etc.) of the burrito, was on top of it, the meat (steak in my case) was wrapped inside of the tortilla...  Taste wise, the steak was okay, about what I was expecting.

The nice touch was desert at the end.  What bugged me the most was our waiter waiting for me to sign the credit card receipt... Overall an average, C experience."}
{"text":"Just like a childhood movie favorite that is not quite as good when you revisit as an adult....Azteca did not hit the spot like it used to years ago in college. I had fond memories but when I visited a few week ago the food was greasy, over portioned and over cooked. The salsa was pleasantly flavorful but our entrees had a not so fresh suspect look about them."}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken fajitas I've had in my life, and I'm a Mexican food snob!"}
{"text":"No. I'm sorry.  No offense to Carolinians, but this is not good Mexican Food.  It doesn't taste right and our food was just funky.  Additionally, the service was not very good.  The husband had a combo with tacos and he asked the waiter if the hard taco shells were made in house or if they were the pre-made type.  He was told they were made in house.  Maybe they are, but they look very pre-made - he was kind of ticked.  I had flautas and they just were not great.  The rice was super boring, neither of us finished it and at some point we realized we never got any chips and salsa?  What Mexican restaurant doesn't give you chips and salsa?!?!?!

We were bummed, but I learned on this trip, don't eat Mexican food in the south... both of our attempts failed miserable.  

Cannot recommend.  DON'T DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"Try to eat here every time I'm in town. Ask for the cactus salad YUM. Great lunch specials. The cheese dip is great with the fresh tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Matthews.  Usually get the steak fajitas, very tender meat with great flavor, onions and peppers always sliced thin and well grilled.  Super service.   The drinks are phenomenal, I love the coconut margarita and the Pina colada.  The cabbage slaw pico that they bring out with chips is unique and so flavorful...very fresh..."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here.  First we ordered cheeses dip and once it came there were no chips.  By the time our chips came, the cheese dip was cold - wasted $5.  Then we waited 40 minutes more before asking for the manager.  The food came 5 minutes later and the manager didn't show up for another 5 minutes! No apology, just excuses that they were so busy that even he had too work in the kitchen so everyone's food would be hot when served.  Food was okay at best.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Oh my heavens!! This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant I have been to! So thankful for the kind couple who directed us here. Food is phenomenal, service is great, the wait time for our food was pretty quick. The portions are large large but honestly makes for the best leftovers!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from here several times and finally stopped in the other day for lunch. They have amazing salsa, lots of cilantro which I happen to love. They don't have many vegetarian options on the menu but they do a have a few. The vegetable burrito was delicious and the portion is huge. The waiters were nice and quick with everything. All in all I would def. go here again and we will continue to get take out from here all the time!"}
{"text":"Yummy queso! I had the Azteca combo, steak was perfect and a lot of food for the price. We sat at the bar and service was not that great, seemed the 1 bartender was running around a bit. But overall, I'd come back"}
{"text":"Huge portions and great \"dirty\" Mexican food! Don't let the fact that it's next to a hotel scare you off! 

The chips and salsa aren't amazing, but they are free. They also serve their chips with a cilantro coleslaw that I really enjoy. 

The deluxe burrito is the size of the baby and I'll give you props if you eat it all. At $9 it's always my go to meal here. It also comes with a side of refried beans and rice. 

The fajitas are also great and big enough to split with someone. My husband and I opt for the trio, which has steak, shrimp and chicken. The meat is cooked perfect and it has a great variety of peppers  and onions with it. Very tasty dish! Make sure you ask for extra shells."}
{"text":"AY AY AY que bueno!!!!!!!!!!

So these might be the most friendly people on the planet. This is some damn fine Mexican food. You can absolutely get a cheese chile relleno off menu which is so great. We got a ton of different dishes on two visits and I might almost drive the seven hours again just to eat here another time..."}
{"text":"Azteca is a down home sort of Mexican restaurant and I'm sure lots of people enjoy it but it's not for me.

The place has a lot of charm with the decor and authentic sounding menu items (I have no knowledge of Mexican cuisine). However the booths are spaced way too closely and you end up banging knees with your dining companion if you sit across from each other. I'm all for a good banging but not in the knees thank you very much.

You get some chips and weird salad thing as well as extremely watery salsa to start off your meal while you decide on what you want. It's kind of nice but the salsa is mostly water so it just slides right off the chip. The food comes out blazingly fast though which is a great bonus if you are hungry and don't want to eat tomato water and chips. Almost everything comes with a salad of wilted iceberg that you can totally skip over, rice and refried beans. The beans and rice are really too salty to eat much of on their own though they were okay with what I ordered which was some sort of well cooked sirloin. Portions are huge, but I was still hungry afterwards because I did not eat most of it.

I was in such a rush to leave that I actually forgot my credit card here and had to return the next day to pick it up. I do not think I will return however if you like this sort of thing go for it."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Service was minimal and not unfriendly but not too welcoming. Fajitas were pretty good. Expresso burrito (pork) was absolutely tasteless. Sauce surrounding it seemed like just thin bland tomato paste. Margarita was fine (giant and super sweet like a lot of other places)"}
{"text":"We recently moved from the San Francisco bay area to Charlotte and we were so happy visiting this restaurant.

Great atmosphere inside and outside, good hostess and big shout out to our server who was very courteous 

Don't forget to order the pitcher of Margarita 

Big portions of food which was so delicious  

Must go!!!"}
{"text":"WOW, was I pleased I found Azteca Mexican Restaurant while on my visit to Charlotte. Azteca is NOT just another Mexican Restaurant. The Food and Service were awesome. They have menu choices that stand out from a lot of other Mexican restaurants. Their salsa was very tasty. They will even make fresh Guacamole table side. This is a MUST GO TO!!!

Visited October 2016"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for more authentic Mexican food.  Azteca has a huge menu and they serve you huge portions.  This place is large so you rarely have to wait to be seated, even on the weekends.  Everything I've eaten here is fantastic, and I have never been able to eat all the food that I'm served.  The best part is that they serve you free sopapillas (tortilla chips with whipped cream, cinammon, and strawberry sauce) with your check."}
{"text":"We loved it!!! Yummo :) Love the men serenading each table and the table side guacamole!!! Dessert was to die for! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican in town! Service is always on point and willing to go the extra mile. Sunday's our my favorite with the live band.  We drive 25 min to go here if that says anything"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, fast and courteous service, great food!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Azteca because I have always heard such good things from other people, but it just didn't do it for me and I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there.

Went for dinner on Saturday night, got there early and were sat right away.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered a Paloma, which was tequila and grapefruit juice and more, but I don't think its what I received.  I could have sent it back but it tasted fine, so I drank it.  We had some queso to start, that was also good.  For entree I got the camarones mexicanos, basically shrimp with onions, mushrooms, green peppers, in a tomato sauce with rice and cheese.  First shrimp tasted very fishy, the rest were better.  But the dish had a sourness to it, the mushrooms were the worst offenders and I couldn't figure out why so I stopped eating them.

So the food overall was fine but the restaurant kind of skeeved me.  There was water underneat my feet so that bugged me, then one of my friends touched some gum stuck under the table and at that point I was done.  I mean I know we're at a restaurant at a Days Inn but come on!!  Finally our server was just not very good or friendly and I sat with an empty water glass for a while.

So I gave it a shot but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family took my father- in- law to eat here today, for fathers day and I  was not very pleased. It seems that we as americans did not get the full experience of the restaurant, nor did our waiter engage us to do so. I noticed they had a cart that went around the room, but we had no clue as to what it served, due to the fact that our waiter did not educate us on what it offered. Our waiter seemed to only understand his on dielect because he did not bring us everything we ordered. I was very disappointed as we sent close to 70.00 on this restaurant. I will never go back. Wendover location is the best hands down.  Also, the wait staff should write down what is order as we had to ask for several items that he  claimed to not have understood we ordered several times. We gave him gradituity, but he really was worth it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, humble but super tasty like authentic Mexican cuisine is. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. I found out about this place yesterday and had lunch there, today I came back to have their dinner!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I went to Azteca for a late lunch after I read some decent yelp reviews. And it was just that... decent.

The interior and decor is pretty neat. We just got back from Mexico, so it was nice to see some authentic art and hear authentic music again. The place was not busy when we went, and initially, service was fast. We got our drinks and chips right away. Then after saying we needed a minute, we got about 10 before someone came to take our order. No one checked on us during the meal. 

The food was good, not the best Mexican, not the worst. The salsa is a little watered down, but I liked it. I got a quesadilla and hubs got fajitas. Both portions were huge. After dinner they bring a little fried pastry for a sweet bite on the house. 

For a casual Mexican meal, Azteca did the trick. I would come back."}
{"text":"The size of this restaurant is absolutely much more roomier compared to the South Blvd. location. If you've been to one of the Aztecas in mid or lower Charlotte, then you won't expect to see anything different on the menu. However, what you can expect to see is a change in staff every six months or so. I believe they've changed owners once or twice during the time they've been open and have shuffled around the waiting and managerial staff. For the better though. They seem much more helpful and coordinated with their food runs and service. 

The food of the restaurant is decent and hits the spot. There isn't really anything special with their enchiladas, tacos, or tamales. I'm not an expert on Mexican cuisine, so I could be totally wrong, but those three items seem to be pretty uniform at any Mexican restaurant. The thing that really bothers me though is the lower quality of meats they have switched to. The chicken tastes like it comes from a Swanson Chicken can and the ground beef they use is the highest amount of fat possible. 

HOWEVER, those are the combos. If you really want the \"quality\" meat and flavor, then you have to go to their speciality items or fajitas and pay a little more money for quality. Nothing wrong in that, amigos. Having learned that the combos aren't really good anymore, I've switched to the Carne Asada and the meat is muchhhh better! Now I actually feel like I'm spending my money for a good reason. Fajitas are starting to show a little more bell peppers & onions than meat lately, so they're starting to slack on that, but the fajitas are pretty standard once again. 

I gave it four stars because of the lack of quality they're starting to go to now (I know, the economy excuse), but everything else is great in the restaurant. Friendly staff, clean tables, and decent prices for dinner. Lunch prices are excellent, so don't be afraid to come here for a quick bite if you don't want the same old $5 sub down the road."}
{"text":"Been eating here ever since they first opened. Something between 15 and 20 years ago.LOVE it! I'll admit sometimes the cooks might be having a bad day. But we all do. The manager has always stops by to greet me while I'm there. And is always concerned about our meals. He has always made our visits pleasurable, corrected and even replaced an order for us if we didn't like it or if it wasn't done right. Please people before you bash or give a bad review, give a restaurant at least 3 or 4 visits before you bash them. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. The food is amazing"}
{"text":"Yesterday for lunch my friend really wanted to eat here, so in an act of almost unfathomable generosity I said OK!  I know I'm selfish!!!

The Wait staff seemed like they did not want to be there, though that has no effect on my review!  The seats were very soft and comfortable, though that will not effect the outcome of my rating it is nice to be physically comfortable.

The food:  Chips, plain, little or no salt, 3 stars!  Salsa, good flavor (better than many), too watered down 3.5 stars.  Steak Fajitas good flavor, better than some, 3.5 stars.  Flour Tortillas 4 stars.  The Pico was better than most 4 stars.   Vegetables, good quality 3.65 stars.  My overall rating of this place is compared to similar Mexican Restaurants.

I can NOT say that I am a fan (so I do not give them four stars) they get 3.25 for me = A -OK!  Though I would not chose to return here  would come back if I really wanted to join my group of friends who chose to.  Many places I would not, so that says something good about this place!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner their with my family who lives in Charlotte.  This is as good as it get's to authentic Mexican food.  The food was fresh and delicious. I highly recommend this place.  Just found another great restaurant to eat when I come to town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times...everything is good!  Affordable, delicious, family friendly.  The fresh guacamole is delicious and so are the margaritas.  The mariachi band is fun and they really \"do it up\" for your birthday!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  I love this place and have been here a thousand times.  This is my go to when I am in the mood for cheese and carbs.  It's inexpensive and delicious.  Get there now if you are not interested in the upscale Mexican places and want something super casual."}
{"text":"So disappointed. This was our favorite place but today the beef was so bad in our fajitas and Deluxe burrito that it was not eatable. Do not know what the new taste is for their beef but it will be hard for me to go back."}
{"text":"So when you walk in the greeters are dressed in Mexican dresses with Mexican colors. It was really cold in the restaurant. You get chips and salsa for free. This guys walks around making tableside guac. We got it and it wasn't so great. Needed more lemon and jalapeños. Wasn't spicy enough. I ordered fajitas and didn't like them so much. They were kinda sweet. Maybe the onions were caramelized too much. I didn't care for the meat. It wasn't strips of meat it was more like bits. I asked for extra rice and all they did was spread it on the plate to look like more. The sweet tortilla chips they gave with the bill were the best part of the meal I think."}
{"text":"ARROZ CON POLLO!!!!  This place is worth it great staff, great atmosphere, awesome food even down to the little tortilla wit whipped cream and strawberry sauce at the end of the meal. The guy that comes around with the guacamole cart makes killer guacamole. The portions are massive I consider myself a big eater and I have a hard time finishing my meal. The staff is great they come into my store after hours and are just as friendly at that time as they are when at work so I guess that means they are sincere. Great place"}
{"text":"Delicious food and yuuugggge portions. We went on a whim for lunch on Saturday afternoon after looking up some options for Mexican on Yelp. I found out later that it's a favorite of many of my food-loving friends. There were chips on the table within minutes of sitting down, salsa and coleslaw as well, though I would have liked a bit more salsa in the bowl and it was bland. 

My husband ordered the burrito especial and myself the enchiladas suizas (green). My plate was larger than I've ever seen for one person. The enchilada portion was two large and the plate was filled with rice, beans, and slaw. I loved the rice and beans most! The verde sauce was also lacking in flavor, some heat would have been nice. My husband was completely pleased with his meal and is already planning our next visit. He even finished off my plate and left ready for a nap. For about $20 we left full following excellent service."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome, great decor.   Don't let the little entrance next to the Days Inn fool you.  I wasn't too impressed with the food.  It was just okay.  The salsa is not good - very runny.  But, they do give you a delicious  slaw with the chips.  Prices are really cheap - great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Staying in Charlotte for a week, asked the Hotel desk person where was a good Mexican restaurant. She raved about Azteca so thought I should give it a try. I walked in and was immediately  greeted and asked where I wanted to sit. They brought over chips and salsa [?] to be honest it really wasn't salsa it was very very watery with some raw onions.. almost no spice at all. I had to add salt to get any flavor at all.

 I ordered the Pork Carnitas Plate. The plate its self was HUGE, however the pork carnitas took up only 1/8 or less of the plate. There were two sides of what i'm guessing was like a \"fresh\" vegetable salsa maybe. I tasted it but it was really odd/dry/no taste. Then the rice & refried beans. The person who made the beans must have made the salsa for the chips as well. They were very very thin...to the point they would fall though the tines in my fork. No cheese on them and again no seasoning/spice. 

Now i'm honestly not trying to be negative towards the restaurant everyone else seemed to really enjoy them... so i'm guessing it has to be that with living in California we have real Mexican food practically on every corner especially with the taco trucks and they are not afraid of spice at all. It was just very different and didn't appeal to me at all...if i came back I would not give them another try...Sorry."}
{"text":"Food was great.  I got the dos compadres which has steak and chicken.  I really enjoyed the food.   Also they sang to other tables for birthdays and it was different because they had instruments like they were in a band.  I was staying in the hotel next door and as I came out another guest in the hotel ask me about the food and I did recommend him to go there"}
{"text":"I didn't think I could find a decent restaurant in the area but this was a nice surprise. The service is friendly and pretty quick. I had the guacamole and mojitos, which were both very tasty. Then shared a fajita plate. This is definitely one of those places where you should share a plate, they are ridiculously big.

Ohh ask for \"pico de gallo\" when you get your chips. It's a small plate with cabbage and salsa, pretty good."}
{"text":"My and my family's all time fave Mexican place. When we started going 15 years ago, it looked like a real hole in the wall. They've renovated and it's actually quite nice inside now. The front patio is the best place to sit when the weather is pleasant. 
The portions are huge, so you really get a bang for your buck (this includes margs, sangria, and the draft beer. Make sure you hire a DD lol).
You really can't go wrong with the menu, but some of my faves:
Vegetarian burrito, deluxe burrito, Popeye quesadilla, seafood quesadilla, camerones con ongos (shrimp and mushrooms). 
Tableside guac is a must. Queso is good too though. Of course, complimentary chips and salsa and pico, plus complimentary dessert (cinnamon toasted tortilla chips with honey, whipped cream, and strawberry sauce).
Friendly and fast service. Parking may look small, but there's more in the back. Fun place to go for birthdays...free sundae and humiliation for the birthday guy or girl (they must wear a sombrero and be sung to by a mariachi band)."}
{"text":"Best of Charlotte please! I just came back from the dullest, blandest, most tasteless Mexican dinner ever!! I only gave it 2 stars because of the waiter, the food wasn't worth even that. 

I knew that I was in for a bad time when I saw so many happy old \"gringos\" leaving the place. That was  a sure sign that the food is closer to Howard Johnson than to Mexico. Sad but true, sorry. Authentic? The place is just like the set for an old Zorro TV movie and it's all downhill from there.

For starters the salsa was so watery that I finished the bowl before I even noticed. I never order nachos before but since they were loaded and topped with Jalapenos I went for it. Pickled jalapenos that is - as hot as kosher pickles. The waiter was embarrassed and rushed some sauteed jalapenos over to us. Still mild but at least they were real.

 I ordered a combo, I always do on a first visit  in Mexican restaurants. All three items, Taco, Enchilada and Chile relleno were stuffed with the same totally tasteless ground beef. No spices of any sort, the stuffing reminded me of a can of Spam. 

Honestly, anywhere closer to the border this place would have been laughed out of town. Martin Mull might approve but unless one was raised on sliced Wonder bread and mayo I'd pass."}
{"text":"The service was good but the food, drinks, and decor not so much. We went there for lunch and the waiter quickly took our order. While we waited, the musicians came over and asked if we wanted a song. We politely declined but the table in front of us accepted and in turn we received a song anyway. lol. While we waited for our food I took in the decor and noticed how outdated and dingy everything seemed. I started to feel a little uncomfortable because the place looked like it hadn't had a thorough cleaning in forever. Our menus were dirty and grimy too. The food arrived and my taco was soft and mushy and the shell split right down the middle and the mushy beef filling spilled onto my plate. My chicken taco was only half filled and tasteless. My boyfriend ordered a sizzling fajita and offered me a taste. It tasted way better than the tacos. He ordered a Mojito and he was shocked when an electric green liquid came out. It was literally the color of green kool-aid or some crazy kiddie drink and it had little green flecks floating in it. We assumed the flecks were bits of mint but the drink had no mint flavor at all. It did have plenty of alcohol but no other real flavor. We may give them another try but will most likely try a different location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican in Charlotte, go here! Great service, great atmosphere and great food! We were so impressed and will definitely be back! Tip- ask for the hot sauce because it is delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here to eat from California. First impression, excellent service, guacamole made table side was delicious. We ordered the large and it fed 4 people comfortably. I ordered the fajitas, my dad ordered a combo platter with tamale, taco and enchiladas, which were good. Excellent value, nice salsa, plates are very large and the pico that comes with the chips is really good. The downfall is the rice and beans were tasteless and stale. One star off for the rice and beans. Overall a pleasant experience would recommend for decent Mexican food and an affordable price!"}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing! I came for lunch about a week ago and I was so happy with everything. They made the guacamole fresh right in front of us! It was sooooooooooo soo good. I ordered 2 enchiladas one chicken and one cheese
Everything was hot and tasted great! The margarita my friend got was HUGE 

Great value and great qualities."}
{"text":"I am not a mexican food expert but this place was pretty darn good!  The outside looks kinda sketch and it's attached to a Days Inn which makes is seem somewhat suspect. But once you walk in it's fine.  

We walked in and were immediately seated and served delicious chips and salsa (only the first 2 bowls of chips are free as I saw on the menu) not like you need more than that but just sayin...

I had a combo plate of a taco and an a cheese enchilada with rice and beans, it was enormous and only about $7, I also had a giant peach margarita that was delicious.  That cost more than my meal ($8 I think?) but I had a rough day and it was worth every penny.  

Consensus - cheap, decent mexican food a short drive from my apartment.  Sold."}
{"text":"This is definitely not a restaurant I would recommend. The food is bland and greasy. The service is not that great either. It used to be a decent place to go but has gotten worse over the years. There's too many other good Mexican restaurants in this area to waste time & money at Azteca."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled. Charlotte doesn't seem to have much to compare. I'm a tough critic because I'm from the west coast. Not that great."}
{"text":"I took my daughter and her friends to a concert last night in Charlotte.  After I dropped them off I searched Yelp for a Mexican Restaurant in the vicinity and found Azteca.  I was seated immediately in the restaurant and received a menu, my chips and saulsa and my drink order was taken.  

I ordered the Pollo Crema and guacamole.  Soon after I received my ice cold draught beer and a waiter came to my table and prepared the guacamole to order using a fresh avacado, onions, tomatoes and celantro. My only disappointment is I ordered a small portion instead of the large.  Moments later the entree was served on a huge dish full of rice and beans with my chicken.  The cream sauce was rich and eating it along with the guacamole was to die for.  

The server was exceptional too and he frequently checked to ensure the food was good, my beverage was full and chips were aplenty.  I have eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and this was by far the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Staying in hotel by Azteca Mexican. Husband ordered take out, Sopa Azteca large $6.99 for me and Pollo a la crema $14.49 for him, paid $34.10 and a tip!I Walked to pick up order my phone number receipt (with order written correctly) Thought it was a bit high. Got back to hotel opened the bag, soup  was mixed seafood $19.25 Pollo crema $12.25 Called immediately and was told that I should have read receipt when I picked up order..THEY WERE RUDE and acted like they didn't speak English. 
Apparently Azteca Mexican Rest takes  advantage of hotel guests!!! Guess they can't make an honest buck!! What happened to pleasing the customer? BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE ... I intend to tell everyone I know not to support this business"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know how this place has such a good rating. It's subpar Mexican food, at best. I recently moved to the area and have been looking for a new go-to Mexican restaurant and this is most definitely not it. I gave it two tries, and I won't be giving it a third. Maybe my standards are very high, but back home we have a variety of non chain brand Mexican restaurants that are AMAZING.

Don't get me wrong - it's NOT bad. It's just not good. And there are definitely better options (I just have to find them still)."}
{"text":"I had a late dinner with a friend of mine and I was noticing the decor. Everything in the place is spot on clean there was no dust anywhere not in the table chandeliers not even in the exposed rafters. The music was authentic the food was fresh and everyone was very nice and cordial. This is a great place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Finding reliable, consistent Mexican cuisine is not easy to do, but we've found Azteca to be completely consistent across all meals and all locations.

Most recently, we ate at the location on Independence. We've tried everything from the chicken tortilla soup (huge portion and very delicious) to the taco salad (meh, it's a taco salad). What we generally order, however, is the pork carnitas. Always very tasty and not over cooked.

Atmosphere is typical of Mexican restaurants in the area, but we have found the consistency to be the key. And, if you're into drinks, they seem to have a ton of mixed adult beverages that practically glow in the dark. The margaritas are very good, so we hear."}
{"text":"Good service. Average Mexican food. Bathroom horrible condition. Only stopped here because we were in a hurry. Parking around back in seedy motel parking lot."}
{"text":"This was a really good experience. Despite the fact that it kinda smelled like cigarettes, we (me, gf, kids) had a nice lunch. 

The prices are insanely cheap for what you get. The kids meals, bean burritos with beans and rice, were only four bucks, and they couldn't finish them. The adults got avocado tostada and veggie burrito. She couldn't finish hers. I finished the burrito but I never give up (when it comes to eating).

If this place weren't three states away I bet it would be a regular spot for dinner. Next time I'm in East Suburban Charlotte I'll probably come back."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Mexican.  Big portions and low prices.  Try the carnitas de puerqo.  Nice atmosphere and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The beau and I came in late on a Friday night, but the restaurant was still packed. No wait, quickly seated over at a booth near the bar. 

We each ordered a drink - I had a margarita (fairly good, had better!) and he had a draft beer (Modelo - can't go wrong!) 

At first the service was fairly good - we quickly received water and the drinks that we had ordered from the bar, but then after that it was like we were nonexistent. 

We ordered cheese dip that took forever to come out (very nice portion size I might add though). Their salsa taste like marinara sauce and its watery- it's horrible. However, their hot salsa (upon request) is great though, if you haven't tried it- and care for spicy-it's wonderful!

We sat and waited for almost 25 minutes when I finally got up and found our waiter and told them we were ready to order. Then by that time we sat for another 30 minutes waiting on our food when they weren't even that busy! 

The food it's self was pretty good though, I had chicken fajitas and the seasoning on the fajitas part was great! My boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla and he really enjoyed. 

However, at the end of the night when it was all said and done we decided that we wouldn't be back here unless we were in a pinch for something quick. We decided that there were other Mexican restaurants with better customer service in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and this may be the best Mexican Food in the country.  Anytime I am in Charlotte I make sure to eat here at least once.  Very traditional look and feel to this place.  Staff is very friendly and recognize me even when it has been a year between visits.  Seems like about every 20 minutes you hear them joyuously singing happy birthday to a customer who is wearing a large sombrero and blushing.  Really feels like the people who work here love their jobs and the customers they serve. 

The Tacos Al Carbon is such a perfect dish, made the right way with skirt steak cooked to perfection and queso fresco cheese crumbles, combined with pico de gallo unlike any other I have had.  All this carefully wrapped in corn tortillas that melt as soon as you get them in your mouth.

The chips and salsa are good......... the guacamole that they make at your table fresh is outstanding and it is fun to watch them make it.  They even let you tell them how much jalapeno to put in depending on how hot you like it.  Queso dip is very tastey as well.  

Food seems to always be out promptly even when I have brought large groups.  I love everything about Azteca except I wish they had one in AZ."}
{"text":"Ok service, not prompt, but friendly. House margarita, big as yo face, portions big as yo face. As far as taste, it satisfies. It is defiantly real Mexican food. Did it blow my mind? No. Would i come back? Most likely. By no means the best, by no means the worst."}
{"text":"So disappointing.  6 months ago we were visiting Charlotte, and the mob around the restaurant forced us to give up and go elsewhere.  We really looked forward to our next visit to Charlotte, so we made a bee line to Azteca.  No crowds on a Friday night:  should have been a red flag.  Good cheese dip, and the \"slaw\" they serve up front is great.  But the very expensive margaritas were bland, we professional margarita consumers could detect no tequila.  Entrees (deluxe nachos, chimichanga, taco salad) were all very large but very flavorless.  Alas, such a disappointment.  We'll try somewhere else next trip!"}
{"text":"I can't ever complaint about this place. It has never disappointed me and I have been visiting since I first moved to Charlotte in 2002. 

Their Tortilla Soup is excellent. They even serve the broth on a separate pot to keep the tortillas crispy for you."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for great Mexican food in the Charlotte area.  Came here because of the reviews on Yelp and it looked pretty authentic.  Upon arrival, I did have some second thoughts.  Conveniently located near a Days Inn that may or may not offer hourly and monthly rates.  If fact we had to park facing this motel in the back of the restaurant.
As we were walking toward the front of the restaurant, a kitchen employee did come out to cut or peel a vegetable over a trash can.  Hmmm...
At the hostess station, we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside on the patio.  We chose inside because it was still hot outside.  No sooner that we sat down we were greeted with the loud mariachi band.  They are good but they are loud.  And the trumpet is even louder.  Anyways, because the mariachi band is loud, the patrons are even louder.  There was a table of 2 families sitting and the women were literally yelling at each other to tell a story.  It was quite obnoxious.  They had small kids with them who were wandering around the table and when the mariachi band came to their table.. of course one of the mom's stood up on her chair to do a dance.  In all my years of going to restaurants, I have never seen that.  I don't frequent strip clubs but I imagine that's what happens there.  
Oh..the food.  The chips were good but the salsa was one step above tomato juice.  I asked for a spicier version and they brought a green salsa that had a little spice.  I ordered the Expresso Burrito which was supposed to be Chile Verde, rice, and beans.  Turned out to be chunks of pork but they were lean and tender.  Overall, decent Mexican food with a not so decent experience."}
{"text":"So my friend and I went here for lunch and was very disappointed in the food and service. For starters, our waiter had a terrible attitude. When we asked for a menu, he seemed to catch an attitude with us for not telling him what we wanted to drink first. After we had to get our own menu, he then went on to take our orders very poorly. It seemed to take forever for our food to arrive, and when it did, it wasn't what we ordered. I won't count this place out yet. They have one more chance with me. If next time is the same, stick a fork in it!"}
{"text":"The entrees are okay but have a salt taste. The tables are tile-topped so the tile grout collects dirt and germs. I have been in better Mexican places where the tops are custom and very colorful however they have a piece of glass or Lexan over top of them to keep the eating surface clean. Last time I was in here there were 2 kids running around their table and the adults, including the waitresses didn't care one bit that my ears were ringing from screaming. I guess that is an occasional part of the \"authentic\" experience. The prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. The food isn't horrible, but it is really just average. People rave about this place, even going as far as saying its the best Latino food they've ever had, even traveling to Latino countries. I don't get it. One of the same yelling children was licking the top of a salt shaker in front of the adults and wait staff, nobody seemed to care. I had to tell the waitress to probably remove that salt shaker since the little girl was licking it. Beware salt shakers at this place with clogged tops, it may be from dried saliva. The place has a nice decor but overall they stay so busy (again, I am baffled as to why) and that causes the cleanliness of the place to be below average. Wait staff is friendly however can be too long between table visits, and then when at the table once can be pushy. Unfortunately I will come back as my girl and her family say its the best, driving 40 minutes from home in SC to come here. I have eaten Mexican food my whole life, authentic and otherwise, and this place to me is average at best. Not positively memorable in terms of deliciousness, cleanliness or value. Yes you get a lot of beans and rice with the food but that's like going to Thanksgiving at someones house and bragging about the portions because half your plate was piled with Stove Top. If my experience here improves, I will be sure to apologize and update my rating, but after 3 or 4 visits, I am doubtful."}
{"text":"The food here is great!! I was quickly seated the server was friendly the chips were warm and the salsa was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable chimichanga that was amazing .. My favorite part after the meal is that you are brought a cinnamon chip with whip cream and strawberry sauce . This place is one of my new favorite places.."}
{"text":"Ehhh I'm updating my review because I want to give them kudos to how well they handled the HUGE cinco de mayo crowd. My coworkers and I showed up around noon and the place was P - A - C - K - E - D. We were group of five and were able to be seated immediately.

Our waiter came to greet us and let us know there was a margarita special: order a margarita, get a free t-shirt. Unfortunately, the waiter failed to share that there was a price markup during the ordering process, but more on that later.

Two baskets of chips and salsa were brought out for the table and our food orders were placed. We plowed through both baskets of chips and salsa and another waiter kindly brought out two more baskets while we waited. Our food did seem to take a little longer than normal but it ended up being all right in the end. I went with the chicken carnitas lunch special and liked it, nothing great but good enough. 

Once it was time to cash out, my co-workers who'd placed margarita orders were shocked to see that the amount was $11-$12 for their drinks rather than the normal $8 or $9 for margaritas. Just would've been nice if the price increase would've been explained.

I went solo a few weeks later because I had a vicious craving for huevos rancheros. I was disappointed once my food came out because there wasn't much egg (huevo) to be found. I ordered the rancheros with chorizo and it was basically a plate filled of chorizo. The beans and rice were not that great and it was just, overall, not a good meal. I was very disappointed.

Can't say that I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"According to this reviewer, this is the best Mexican food in Matthews.  Each meal comes with a complimentary basket of chips and salsa, and the portions are very generous and generally delicious.  I highly recommend the Arroz con Pollo.  

Service is prompt and polite, and the interior is clean and charming in a constructed-before-we-were-concerned-about-stereotypes sort of way.

If you are in Matthews, this is a much better bet than Monterrey or that sketchy place downtown."}
{"text":"Okay when I kept reading massive portions, I was still surprised. Pictures do not do it justice!! Check my photo, standard size steak knife, MASSIVE plate.

Excellent service, all the food was really tasty though rice was average at best. The food is plentiful though so you'll get full even if you leave rice!

Shared cheese dip with the table and ordered the carne asada. It can be hit or miss, but not only was Azteca's good, it might be THE best carne asada I've ever eaten at a Mexican restaurant! 

If you want good grub, good service and a great value, don't hesitate to eat here. It'll be a staple stop whenever I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Margarita was awful, sour & served in a warm glass. Food was okay at best. Salsa is very watery, has a chipotle / smoke flavor which I wasn't a fan of. Much better Mexican places out there. Staff was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, the staff is always friendly and you are seated quickly. Some nights they have a mariache band that comes in and goes from table to table taking requests. They also linger around at your table for a tip, which is slightly bothersome. It'd be better if they had a sectioned area to perform and people to come up and dance and leave tips. But regardless, the food is yummy and they have a HUGE drink selection."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. It's great food and great service. Alex has been such a wonderful waiter and made our experience a pleasure each time."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in north Charlotte! We always sit at the bar where the bartender, Nacho, (yes that's really his name) takes great care of us. My fiancé and I always get the cheese dip and arroz con pollo (with cheese sauce instead of tomato sauce).  The service is always on point and the portions are huge!  The restaurant stays pretty busy even though it's off the main road but there is plenty of seating.  Clean restaurant and always an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"We rarely go out on my birthday because it's a major dining holiday - Valentine's Day.  But this time the whole family got together and I chose Azteca, thinking it wouldn't be \"too\" badly crowded.  Well, it was full, but SO festive and fun!  We sat at the bar while we waited for our table for 7, and the bartender was entertaining and quick with our margaritas, even making a little virgin margarita for the youngster with us.  We got our table fairly quickly, and we kept our waiter entertained and coming back and forth pretty quickly, too, considering the room was full of party groups.  As always, the food was filing and delicious!  This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and it was really good to be back, and share it with 3 in our party who had never been.  They are now fans, as well."}
{"text":"Seriously good food.  Sat at the bar, had a couple top shelf margaritas- they were good - and beef fajitas.  The food was solid, tasty and authentic.  Good service too.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We've lived nearby for a little over 6 months and have only heard great things. We decided to take advantage of the good weather and head over for dinner on the patio. Initially I was concerned the patio would be full since every time we drive by its crowded. Thankfully, it was pretty empty! Lucky us.

First off, the service is pretty poor. They weren't very friendly when we were asking/waiting to be seated. Second, we had to ask several times for more chips since they only put about 10 chips to each basket. The longer we waited, the harder the bowl of queso we ordered got. In the first 30 minutes we waited 15 minutes for more chips and a refill on our drink. We finally got our food and, not surprisingly, the order was wrong. We just sucked it up and didn't say anything since we figured it would take another 30 minutes for them to correct it.

Overall, food is about 4-stars, but the service was at best a 1.5. I'll be generous and give Azteca 2 stars."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on food. I went back a few times. If you go during a busy time, food may not be done well. On slow days, the food is on point. Overall, this is probably as good as you can get in Charlotte. Doable."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based on it's proximity to the hotel plus it's status on YELP and couldn't have been more pleased. The food and service here were nothing short of amazing. I couldn't decide what to order because the selection was ginormous and chose a combination place consisting of 1 enchilada, 1 chili relleno and a hard taco with rice, beans and their famous slaw. The cost for this ... on the largest plate I've ever seen ... was only $9.99. AMAZING! I had plenty to take home and devour later, which always makes me happy. There is a table side guacamole cart that is nothing short of incredible that you absolutely have to partake of. We ordered ours with all of the ingredients and couldn't help making the 'mmmmm' sound with the first bite. I never considered cilantro in making guacamole.  We ordered the small and it was plenty for the two of us.  We also treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas. The price for this HUGE pitcher was $25 and would have been a sufficient amount for 4 people. The two of us overindulged .. ;) .. and had plenty left over that we had to leave behind on the table. It seemed such a waste of the best margaritas (the ingredients were perfectly proportioned) that I have had in a long time. Actually thinking of coming back here before I leave Charlotte. OUTSTANDING."}
{"text":"Top shelf margaritas were excellent. Guac made by our table was good and to order. Yay jalapeños. Chicken enchilada was great - not too heavy and he sauce was yummy. Aztec steal and butterfly steak was 3/5 stars bc while steak had good flavor it wasn't very tender. Shrimp were good. Kid's chicken quesadilla was 3.5/5 because wasn't well put together but chicken had good flavor. Flan was great - former flan lovers, this one is for you!"}
{"text":"Just great Mexican food with out all of the high class fluff that has permeated the  genre. I try something different every time and recommend it all.
The food is delicious and served piping hot. The entire staff is super friendly and attentive. I don't know if it's every night or just weekends, but they have a live mariachi band that is really good. So bring a few dollars to tip them and request a song."}
{"text":"Food was great!! My friend and I randomly chose this place for brunch one Sunday when we were both craving Mexican. We didn't see this coming but apparently it's a popular brunch place I mean seriously people were moving towards this place in hordes you would think they were giving away the food. We would have not waited but thankfully the patio was first come first serve so we were able to sit immediately due to everyone else seeming to be a large party. The service was just ok but honestly I think it was because they were basically under attack by the amount of people trying to eat there so not holding that against them they were just trying to survive at that point. Given the busyness of the place the food came out rather quickly and the micheladas we had were to die for. Definitely recommend this place and don't be scared away if it seems really really busy!"}
{"text":"Good food, Good price. We went around 4pm on a weekday, not very crowded, which is good. The meal protein was very big, both my husband and I got a doggy bag.I love the deep fried flour tortilla, it's flaky and delicious. Difintnaly will come back here again."}
{"text":"Ola!  Please be seated amigos and...amig-etts.  The side effect of the great food here is me, all of the sudden, thinking that I can speak Spanish.  I love making up words while drinking a one gallon margarita and stuffing my face full of tamales, guacamole (made fresh in front of you), and saucy satisfaction.  This is the best Mexican food I have found thus far in my short tenure in Charlotte.  I have been here almost ten times and I haven't had a bad experience so far.  Now, I don't order the combo dishes, I typically get something like Pulpo, or some chicken, seafood, or meat dish - reliable broad spectrum quality.  I am getting excited about my next visit just writing this.  I envision my next entrance with me bobbling up on a donkey as I rock out a poncho with sombrero and sunglasses with a fork in a napkin sheath.  Don Quixote can inspire.  More re-fried beans please."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in my opinion in Charlotte. Guacumole is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Having been to most of the area Azteca's this one ranks lowest. 

First strike is being attached to a shady Days Inn. Other than that once you get in the door, its typical Mexican chain restaurant fair inside.
Everything, and I mean everything my wife and I ordered came covered in greasy cheddar cheese. Not even a real Mexican cheese, but grocery store pre-shredded cheese.

Our server was very attentive, even took his lunch break at the next table over so he could keep his eye on us. Even though someone else has \"covered\" his break they both ended up serving us. So great service.

Food quality at other Aztecas just seems higher, and cleaner."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't too impressed with this place. Food was ok but the service was pretty awful. No salsa or drink refills. Ive been twice now and I don't think I'll go again."}
{"text":"I was meeting my date in the North Lake area, and my friend recommended Azteca in the past, so we decided to check it out!

I got there before he did, so I grabbed a table and ordered a Dos Equis Amber, my favorite, and it was on special!  They brought me chips and salsa to munch on, which were good.  I asked if they had anything spicier- and my server, who was very attentive, sent over one sauce- checked in with me, then sent an even spicier salsa once he realized I could handle it.  I'm all about hot sauces and salsas, and they were both great!  The hotter of the two was pretty crazy I have to admit.

Anyways, my date arrived and we ordered a little later.  He ordered a burrito, which he enjoyed.  I got the mixed fajitas- my usual at a mexican restaurant- and they were decent.  Portion was good for the price- I believe it was around $12.  The shrimp were kinda small, compared to my favorite spot, Three Amigos, in Plaza Midwood.

It's a big restaurant!  If you have a big group, it would be perfect!  Very attentive service, and I loved the tortilla treat at the end.  Who doesn't like honey and whipped cream?!?  Yum.  I'll hit it up again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"My husband and i decided to check out Azteca because we were in the Matthews area and he has a Mexican craving!  Other Yelpers had good things to say- so we decided to check it out as well.

When you pull up I like that it's in its own little building.  A little confusing where to turn in off busy 74 but we figured it out.

When you walk in, you feel like you're really at a Mexican restaurant!  I have been to Mexico quite a few times- and this place definitely has a more authentic feel than most.  I'd also say that it looks nicer and more upscale than most.  All employees are outfitted in traditional clothing which makes you feel like you are getting ready for an experience!  We sat outside, and enjoyed the patio.  The inside was very nice.

I ordered fajitas, my husband got Arroz con Pollo.  I enjoyed my fajitas but the portion was little small in my opinion.  The flavor was good but I could've used some more chicken on my sizzling plate.  My husband's plate was huge!  More like a platter!  He gets that meal often at different restaurants and he liked that version quite a lot.  

Service was honestly a bit slow.  There was a very large party inside and they must've been struggling keeping up with everyone else.  If service was on point I could give at least a half of a star back!

All in all a good visit with modest prices."}
{"text":"I go here pretty often, once a week or so. I have never had a bad experience. I always take friends here from out of town and everyone loves it. If you go late at night the guacamole man will dance on the table! 

Pros: awesome service. great prices."}
{"text":"Although I gave four stars, I did see a cockroach crawling on the wall in our booth. Other then that this is my absolute favorite place to get Mexican food. I guess a roach is expected, really gives that authentic feel."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed eating here for years!  Great service and really good food!  Have taken the entire family there and they don't miss a step. Guacamole is made table side and is very tasty. We normally have chicken chimichangas which are always fantastic!  Husband changes up from time to time and has never been disappointed. 
Would recommend to friends...good friends..."}
{"text":"I believe there are two Azteca locations in Charlotte.  I've been to this location many times but honestly it's not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town and don't plan on going back.  They give you chips and two types of salsa at your table upon arrival.  You can tell in the picture that the salsa is very watery, which makes it difficult to stay on the chip.  They currently have pink tortilla chips for breast cancer awareness, which I thought was pretty cool. I've ordered many different things on the menu over the years but today I had the taco salad.  They load that salad shell up with shredded chicken.  Honestly, there is more chicken in the salad than lettuce.  I've had to order extra lettuce on the side before just to really make it into a salad. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. They have different lunch specials from day to day. Service has usually been quick.  I've been there previously with large groups and the service was also quick. They prepare guacamole table side if you wish.  Their cheese dip is delicious. At the end of the meal they bring everyone at your table a desert tortilla chip with whip cream and strawberry drizzle. It's very tasty.  I included a picture of it in my review.  This is the larger of the two locations and can accommodate large groups.  It does get very loud at peak times and especially at night on the weekends. I prefer other Mexican restaurants but this ones not bad. It's worth giving it a chance."}
{"text":"Azteca has the most giant plates I've ever seen. They are the size of semi truck tires. It's spectacular.

In addition to piling on the food like they're feeding wild animals, it's good quality stuff. There are tons of vegetarian options, and the margaritas are big and cold and sweet and salty...yum!

I've been to Azteca several times, but I'm always surprised by the little sopapillas they bring at the end as a complimentary dessert. Isn't that a wonderful little customer service bonus? You get used to the free nachos at Mexican spots, but the free dessert pushes Azteca over the line from a 4 star to a 5 star for me.

The latest time I went there, I was with a group of about 15 people. We didn't have a reservation, but the staff set us up in the middle of the restaurant with a huge table, and they weren't even grumpy about having to split all our checks. The food is fresh and good, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. It's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, and you can always count on bringing home leftovers for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"This place basically sucks. I'm very patient when it comes to service because I'm a server so I know how it is to be busy and having to greet a table when you're running around. When you walk in, there wasn't a hostess in sight  until a couple of minutes so I assumed they were busy. I sat in the bar area. After being sat multiple people saw us and never once greeted us until about 10 minutes later. I thought about just getting up and leaving but I was hungry. Good portions of food but it doesn't taste good so that's pointless. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Friendly host and staff! Margaritas were amazing, I recommend the top shelf! The queso was very good, I could've taken some more heat though. Salsa was different, very liquidity but I also understand this is an authentic Mexican spot not the Tex-Mex I grew up on. I would've take more heat in the salsa as well, but I just really like spicy foods. Got the camarones Mexicanos and it was very good. Our server provided us with hot sauce that was perfect! Overall a great place to eat and quiet, not super glamorous in decor but that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"Holy YUMM! Above and beyond goodness. Fresh guac made to order, in font of my face. Even a little dessert fried goodness with the check."}
{"text":"Loved the decor of this place, just the right amount of crooked, colorful paintings on the walls. There was a lady singing with the mariachi band when I walked in, which made me immediately like the place. I knew I was in for a good experience. 

I wasn't super hungry, and because I did my research, knew I couldn't finish an entire entree. So, I got a seafood quesadilla which consisted of a crap load of shrimp smothered in cheese, guac and sour cream. I mean, this thing was pretty gigantic for an appetizer item. My friend got the Idaho Nachos, why, I don't know, but it was pretty much huge potato wedges with pieces of chicken, all covered in cheese and sour cream. Strange, but it worked. I know, not typical things you'd order from here, but they were all satisfying and I know I'll come back here for an enchilada next time. 

The waiters were attentive, and a few were even rather good looking, hellooo Alejandro ;D. I digress, but anyway, our glasses were always full and they were very generous with the chips and salsa. They even gave us dessert which was a puffed up, fried tortilla drizzled with honey and cinnamon. 

I'll be back Azteca!"}
{"text":"Have been going there for over 20 years.
The food and service have always been good. Then on the evening of march 24th we went to have dinner with some friends there. The food and service were good as usual, But, when we were done eating, we were just sitting there talking with our friends, as friends often do when dinning together, and our waiter proceeds to tell us that if we are done 
can we be on our way because they have people waiting to be seated.
Kind of baffled, we were like okay....
Then as we left there were barely a few people waiting.
Guess I should've ordered desert or a post dinner drink so that maybe they would have allowed us to sit and visit for the amount of time we chose.
I didn't think this was a very good way to treat a long time good customer,
Or any customer.
Probably won't be back any time soon,
Or recommend to others, as I wouldn't want others to experience this type of treatment. 

-Regretfully let down"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing every time we come here for dinner. The service is too notch and the food is on point. We always get the table side guacamole - it's a must!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for your Mexican food.

Food - if you order a small platter, you will get a good amount of food. The larger platter will fill you up and beyond. If you are like me, I had to pack the rest for to-go. I believe waiting for our food, while loading up on their salsa/guacamole sauce + chips, really got me. Don't scrimp on the guacamole, it's good!  The tamales/enchilada combo was what I had ordered. Although, the shredded beef tamale was not wrapped in the corn shuck, which takes the fun out of unwrapping your tamales.  Enchilada looked messy, but surprisingly good!! Overall, I'd come back, when I feel for Mexican.

Service - good and attentive.  No complaints here.

Place - you get a good Aztecan vibe! 

**Cinco de Mayo is coming up, order their house margarita, you get a free shirt!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Came with my family. Great service. Good parking. Good portions and pricing. Not such a good location. Old and in the cut location. Passed by it for years and never checked it out. Might go back when I'm in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"My motto is do no harm but I wanted to be fair..I took 5 of my family members there and we had dinner. My mom and I had fajitas - ALL of the servings are huge by the way - the free chips and salsa were tasty as we waited on our food... I did have to go find our waiter at one point - after tracking him down he was more attentive the rest of the night...

The flavors were okay? I don't know how else to describe it - nothing was stand out except portion size - classy presentation and meh service"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!

Carne asada, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, etc....dinner was PERFECT. I love the homemade tomatillos hot salsa. Free sopspias (so?) for dessert were very good. Top notch service and very clean. We can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food & large portions. Friendly staff & prompt service. We always try different dishes each time we go &  they are consistently delicious."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find since it's off from the main road.I like the decor and service. Our server was very nice. It's a big pricey for a place like this. The food are ok. My brother's stake was hard to cut. I ordered Taco which came in with rice and beans, and I liked it lot. I might not go back again and definitely going to find another authentic Mexican place. Sorry! :("}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Get the queso and quac. This place is excellent:) their portions are large but the service is on point too. Affordable date night or bring the kids."}
{"text":"The salsa was like water..very liquidy. I was already not thrilled with the food, but then got very sick as soon as I got home and was vomiting all night. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not a big fan of Mexican in general beyond tacos that I cook myself at home. 

That said, this place is pretty great. Price is reasonable for the mountain of food you get with most meals, and the service has always been friendly and fairly prompt when I've eaten here. I've only ever been for dinner, so one of these days I need to do the lunch test and see if it's doable in a 'typical' lunch hour or not. 

For the one or two times a year that I am in the mood for Mexican, I go with Azteca!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a mixed review.   We have been here many times and enjoy the food.  Unfortunately there are a number of servers that are not good.  

The portions and food are done really well.  The Carne Asada is always a go to favorite.  The Chile Verde is also another good choice.   

Unfortunately we just don't frequent this restaurant that much because of the poor service."}
{"text":"You don't need to order the Speedy Gonzales to experience extremely speedy service! They are FAST!

Food is spectacular. I recommend checking out their \"special\" menu that has pictures and everything... those aren't your run-of-the-mill items... we tried a dish that had fish, chicken and steak (and I wish I could remember the name of it!) Anyway, my boyfriend and I split it... it was so much food! Absolutely delicious though... more authentic than other menu items. The chips/salsa were plentiful and their fresh-made (in front of you) guacamole is delicious.

Love the sopapillas you get before you leave! Great touch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing!! Big portions and not expensive! I always et the chicken chimichanga and I couldn't be happier!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Charlotte by far. Great staff, super quick service, and delicious fare at reasonable prices. My favorite is pollo asado, but you simply can't go wrong. The real deal!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, total dive but great value for the amount Of food you are served. Service is always fast, and they tons of seating inside and on the patio. You never have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and I like Azteca restaurant around charlotte so we picked this spot since we were having a surprised B'day party for a friend who lives near by. The staff was courtious enough to work with us on the suprise B'day party. We were constantly going back and forth from our table to front door to see and make sure if they arrived or not so that we can supprise them and they didn't mind at all. 

We were total of 16 folks all together and they took really good care of us. Even after the supprise, they brought drinks on time, the food were ordered and it came in resonable amont of time considering we were big group. 

Even in between the supprise, apatizer and full dish items, we were hanging out like it was our place. No one bothered us and staff was very helpful in filling in our refills. 

All in all we had a plesent experience at this location."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for authentic Mexican quisen. They also have a bar.  I got the fiesta chimichanga. It was mouth watering."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since 2001. The place has not changed very much, typical 
\"Aztecan\" theme. Very colorful, one thing I can say is this place is very clean. The food is amazing the closest thing you will get to going to Mexico. I love the arroz con pollo, the wait staff has changed a little bit and that is why I am giving it four stars.They need to have a little more friendliness I shouldn't be able to read I don't want to be here on your face."}
{"text":"Awesome! Go on a Friday or Saturday night. Not only do yout get delicious traditional Mexican fare but also a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!!!!! And the desert they give you delicious. Second time here and I'm happy. Large portions for cheap"}
{"text":"They have the Best Salsa I have ever ate. I will be back to get more of this. An the Nachos was really good. A lot different than I have back home from where Im from."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican Restaurants in Charlotte . Old school menu with Combo platters and platters. Been there many times over the past few years, I kind of feel like food quality is getting less. I ordered a Chili Rellano and it was burnt but filled with delicious cheese and Mexican Crema. Guacamole is good but expensive because they make it tableside . Chips are just meh. Waiters and Waitresses are very nice. You won't be overwhelmed with compliments when you go but it's not terrible ."}
{"text":"I seriously want to jump into a bowl of their steak fajitas and eat my way out. They are by far the best in Charlotte. Fresh gaucomole cannot be beat, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't order it."}
{"text":"Never even knew about this place until I started hearing rumblings about this must eat place off Woodlawn.  I love Mexican food, probably my favorite, so I decided to give it a shot.

Meh...what's all the fuss about?  Very typical Mexican food.  Blindfold me, put a plate from Azteca or a place like Monterrey and I promise you I couldn't tell the difference.  

That being said....it's good.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed but at the same time, never overly impressed.  In the restaurant business no bad news is probably great news so take that as a compliment Azteca!

Service is quick and polite always."}
{"text":"Here in Charlotte from out of town. Just had an awesome lunch. Great drinks, guacamole at the table was made to order. The fish tacos were awesome and my wife had shredded beef tacos, the beef was very tasty.  The pico de gallo at the table was the best."}
{"text":"Big portions and nice staff, but the food wasn't as good as I expected :( but Im from San Diego where Mexican food is highly rated :)"}
{"text":"Great staff. Super friendly. 100% authentic Mexican food. Not fancy but sooo good! Don't be scared when you pull up and it's connected to a days inn! Their fajitas and mojitos are yummy and their table side guacamole is a must. Ask for Nery, he's a great server! Sit on the patio if the weather allows! This place is consistent and reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been to Azteca many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so much. I can't put my finger on the reason, but I have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the place had changed. Before this visit I would have rated Azteca 4, but now it's a generous 3."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food for a great price! Delicious margaritas && tasty tacos! Always great service && very clean."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food portions are huge. Wide variety of menu options! The pitchers of margaritas is definitely for more than two people. Highly recommend this local establishment. Will definitely come back here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Si se puede! Yes I can eat Mexican two days in a row. This was Round 2, a quick lunch with friends. Apparently the cure for a hangover is their house made sopa, so off we went to this spot I had no idea was even here, stuck on the side of a Days Inn. I have to say, I was really surprised. The decor is fantastic, I instantly forgot I was mere yards away from South Boulevard and was transported to a Mexican hideaway. While I was headed to work and stuck with water, my friend had a beer the size of his face (hair of the dog that bit him.) 

The food was delicious. I had the Lunch Special #38- Avocado Tostada- and got a kick out of saying it- 38 Special! Ha! It was really delicious, even the rice and beans which I normally shove to the side. We enjoyed our sopapillas for dessert, and then had a quick photo shoot on the mechanical donkey by the front door. Sorry to say it's not plugged in, but it's good for a stationary picture! I will definitely be back- their dessert menu alone is tempting me!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food comes out fresh and hot. I also appreciate that most foods are not over salted. The portions are big. The tortilla soup is great but it's a bit salty for me so I have to water it down a bit. When I get home, I add some rice and more water and I can get another two servings out of it. :) I also love the live mariachi band on the weekends. My kids have a ball there."}
{"text":"Arriving here you must first clear a gauntlet of bees, get passed the gross garbage can holding the door open. Then once you get you order (to go) you are given the tiniest (about 1/32 cup) of salsa. The owner, Maria, says that's all I would get with my $18 order. Any more salsa I have to pay $1.25 for the same 1/32 cup size. RIDICULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and it wasn't very good.  Food was bland and didn't taste all that great.  Nothing special..."}
{"text":"Damn good food!   I love Mexican and its a hidden treasure.   Note you can get hot sauces to go.  Bring empty jars and get their green sauce its like fire.  La mejor comida mehicana en el sur este!!"}
{"text":"Terrible, slow service. Server was rude and tried to charge everyone extra for more expensive entrees than what we ordered. Food was mediocre. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I ate here one night with my mom I was very disappointed the food wasn't good I ordered fajitas they were bland the salsa was watery as well"}
{"text":"I don't know how authentic it is but I love their Mexican Stir fry dish. The location makes it easy to get to. The food in the menu is exactly what comes to the table. Just as you ordered it. The staff is attentive but I wish it was a little faster."}
{"text":"It was very busy when we went. The waiter took too long to come and take our order. The food took a long time to come to our table and our order was brought to us at different times. My bacon wrap shrimp was way over done, dry and hard. The beans and rice was not bad. My wife wants to give this place another chance. I dont."}
{"text":"Great place. Good prices. Wonderful service. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that I thought there rice could be better."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The pickled cabbage that comes with the chips and salsa are my favorite.  Big selection for the money."}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte for a week.  I have no problem eating this for dinner every night... but my waistline will!

Tons of tasty food for a really good price.  Wow!  Solid rice & beans served with a side of cole slaw -- and this was the SIDE to my entree (tamale/chile rellano/enchilada combo).  Today was takeout, but tomorrow -- going to try the dine-in option!!!"}
{"text":"Great service... I'm from California and this is just as good as the Mexican food I have had in California."}
{"text":"I don't recommend calling here for takeout. The person taking phone orders kept putting us on hold, then switched us over to someone else who is unfamiliar with the menu. When picking up our order the person was very unfriendly. Food itself was underwhelming. Just go to Chipotle, less hassle."}
{"text":"We went to charlotte for the nascar race and stayed at a hotel near this restaurant. The location was very convenient since it was right across the street and we were pretty tired. The food was great! I had the shrimp enchiladas and they were pretty good. We also had a margarita pitcher which was good too. Service was excellent. No complaints."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Had the carne asada plate. They definitely give you your money's worth of food"}
{"text":"I've been going to Azteca since I was a little chica. My dad would order \"Mucho Margartia and Little Rockas.\" That meant daddy had a rough week. The servers have always been super personable and helpful especially if it's your birthday. They make the most commotion of any restaurant I've been to. Out comes the drums, guitars, triangles, a cow bell, a wooden flute, and this one that sounds like your going up Thunder Road (wooden roller coaster, for you non-Carowindseres).  So much is going on... Can be fairly terrifying at first. 

And then they bring you food :) My fav, which is not on the menu anymore, are the three steak carnitas with cilantro and onions served on corn tortillas dipped in salsa with a side of frijoles. What great prices too! They now have a fresh salsa/guac cart AND a woman making fresh tortillas. Looks like a pretty hot job, but she is so cool under the pressure. I never finish all of my food, so then!.. I get to reminisce the following day. 

Deeelightful."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Fast friendly service the food is always great and hot. Salsa is amazing. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Staying close to the airport for an early flight the next morning, we were just looking for sustenance. Decor was over the top colorful and overflowing. Oh well, at least the chips were good and warm and service was fast and friendly. I asked the waiter for suggestions and went with the arroz con pollo expecting a bland Americanized version. Looking around, most of the patrons were Mexican families, a good sign. The plate was the size of a medium pizza and overflowing with food. More like a stew, the entree was huge, full of flavor. The best I've had by far. Authentic Mexican. Outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was fine and served in a timely manner (refills were slower), but the waiter was rather short with us as he was the other times we were there. Otherwise it was okay."}
{"text":"Guacamole is on point. Service is great, the best I've seen. The food was good."}
{"text":"Seriously best Mexican food I have ever tried! Love coming here and getting steak tacos or carnita tacos. I truly believe they would be more popular if their location wasn't so hidden."}
{"text":"Food was so-so but I have had much better Mexican food elsewhere.  The place definitely needs to be rennovated and enlarged."}
{"text":"Loved it. Was starved after a long day with no lunch and found this place before flying home the next morning. Absolutely the best table side made guacamole I've ever had. Because they keep it simple. Perfectly rip avocados, minced onion, salt, fresh squeezed lime juice, a little jalapeno and tomato and a little cilantro. Then lightly smashed up to stay chunky. Was worth every penny. Then had a carne asada with grilled shrimp plate and everything was very good. Asada flavorful and tender and grilled as it should be. Great service and they make a decent michelada too. I will go back here again."}
{"text":"It's solid Mexican food with good service. Decent chips. Decent salsa. They even have a slaw like salsa that is tasty.  The actual food portion sizes are smaller than what I think we typically get. But they give you plenty of rice and beans to make up for it. It might just be me but I think their prices are creeping up a little as well. 

The best part is the unexpected little treat at the end."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal tonight, the Paella and the Dos Amigos were both awesome!! We eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants and I highly recommend this one! The staff was friendly and attentive, we had a great experience"}
{"text":"This is, by far, our favorite Mexican place in the Charlotte area. Although they have other locations, I think this is the best one. If you like Fajitas, they have the best! The beef is nice and tender and very well seasoned. The service is just as good as the food! If you want a delicious dinner, at a reasonable price, you won't be disappointed here! Skip the mall restaurants, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We needed somewhere to go around 9pm for dinner. We have been wanting to try this place out for a while and it's always busy. We were seated immediately and our waitress was incredibly sweet. The service was fast, the food was tasty, and the portions were huge. The menu is endless and there is something for everyone! Definitely going here again."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to an Azteca, but first to this location. The service was spectacular. They had us covered on everything before we even had a chance to tell them we needed it. Drink refills, salsa, chips. Was great. Food was great as usual. Both our meals were right, no issues. Just like the other location, would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"We sat outside since it was a nice night. There was a party of 10 outside that immediately started doing shots. Add that to the fact that 5 of them were smoking and it took away from the experience. Our server did his best but was a bit overwhelmed from the large party. And was asked to take photos by 3 different tables. Tacky on the patrons part. He was clearly struggling as it was. The food was good, even though one of our orders was wrong. We chalked it up and took it. It was close. Fajita chimmichonga instead of just chicken. Still was good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican food in Charlotte. Great service, great food and a great atmosphere. 

I had tried several places since Texas and Azteca is by far the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago for a business lunch and am catching-up on my reviews. I have eaten at this location many times and have never had a bad meal. It seems like the portions have gotten smaller though. It is always jammed for lunch but usually you are seated quickly.  The food is good and I especially like the pica de gallo (salsa).  The fact that they have been in business for so many years shows that they know what they are doing.  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot if I'm meeting people out. Big fan of the chicken fajitas. You really can't beat fajitas for $8, and they're good! The service is always great and the food comes out quickly. Never been there for dinner but it's always super busy when I drive by!"}
{"text":"I like the feel of this restaurant with nice lightings, buzzing with people and delicious food, though I must admit, the additional parking area shared with days inn looks kinda shady. Was here for dinner with my wife and was greeted with smiling staff, you do have options to sit out and have food but I preferred sitting indoors. The chips and salsa were good, but not anything extra ordinary. The dinner portions of fajitas and one more dish(forgot the name) were more than enough to make you full so be sure if you are bigger groups to not order too much. The taste was good, liked the freshness of the veggies and the chicken was well fried and all items were served hot. The tortillas were hot and were freshly made. This is a must go if you like Mexican food and with so much Mexican families coming to this restaurant, as I could see from the crowd, am pretty sure this is closest to the authentic taste they have in Charlotte. Please try it out."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant if you are served by Jorge. He barely acknowledged us as we were seated at his table. With a very stern look, he greeted us by abruptly asking us what we wanted to drink. Without even a faint smile, he was gone. The only time Jorge came back was to give us our check. Even that seem to irritate him. He was truly unpleasant and made our visit very disappointing. Although we should have left or gotten another an table, we were so hungry we stayed. We complained to the manager who was more defensive than empathic. Again, we were rather surprised with his response as well. As for the food, it was mediocre at best. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area. Do try those over this one."}
{"text":"I've been going to your restaurant since I was a little girl and it's literally one of my favorite places in the world to eat! Their service is awesome their customer service is awesome and everytime I eat there the food is always great!! To me you guys have the best fajitas in the world, anytime I want Mexican food you guys are the restaurant I choose!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Azteca after a day of shopping in the area and made a last minute change to our dinner plans. Our group wasn't very keen on fast food so we picked a restaurant near our hotel and settled quickly on Azteca. In retrospect, we should have read reviews before deciding on this restaurant. Chips and dip were served when we sat down but instead of red and white sauce we got red sauce and Cole slaw. Kind of interesting for a Mexican restaurant. My dining companion had chicken fajitas, I had the chicken taco salad. The fajitas were very well prepared and the chicken was delicious. The taco salad was not very good. Chicken tasted funny and was served with cheddar cheese instead of the typical Mexican cheese which mixed differently with the chicken. Overall, I would not return to this restaurant but it wasn't too terrible for a last minute late meal."}
{"text":"Meh.  

The best thing here is the chips and salsa which while I love chips and salsa, it's not enough to make it a meal, especially after spending the afternoon drinking beer.

I ordered a combination of enchilada, taco, and tamal.  The taco consisted of mostly shredded lettuce.  The tamal was chicken, I was expecting pork.  And while there were no noticable flaws with the chicken enchilada, it really had no flavor.

The plate was huge but it was filled mostly with rice and beans.

Another flaw was I ordered an unsweetened iced tea and while the original order was correct, the refills were not.  This happens a lot in Mexican places.  If I wanted to drink sugar water with tea coloring, I would have ordered it!

And the worst thing of all from this experience is it sat with me the rest of the night...and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Azteca, what happened?  You were always an option for decent Mexican food but today's visit you were quite below average.

The service was good as it usually is here but my combination of chicken enchilada and beef taco had absolutely no flavor.  Couple that with the usual flavorless beans and rice and it was quite bland.  How could this happen at a once decent Mexican place.  Did you take lessons from Tres Pesos across the street?

Meh, I am sorry to say that I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant on the north side of Charlotte! We love La Unica, but the wait is much less here and the food is insane!"}
{"text":"Love the food. But I was disappointed when order takeout and order pico de gallo salsa with chips. Got home and had their normal salsa not pico de gallo which I paid extra for."}
{"text":"First time here. Will be coming back. Server was fast and on attentive. He kept our drinks topped off! A must in my book. I got a shreded beef chimichanga. Delicious! Rice had some hard dried out spots, like i got the scrapped sides of the pan. My girlfriend got the arroz con pollo. It was ok... Tasted like cambells tomato soup... Overall was good and will be back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Another Mexican restaurant that doesn't look like anything spectacular from the outside, but the inside doesn't disappoint. I'm starting to think the trend is that the worse looking the outside facade, the better the food & prices are. This Azteca may not have the best Mexican food, but it's pretty good, especially for the price.

Nothing really stands out to me about any of the lunch plates I've gotten, but I just know I leave very full. The place is a tad bit on the smaller side, with some odd booth arrangements, so expect a wait if you go during the lunch hustle & bustle. It can also be a pain getting in & out of the parking lot but it's well worth it.

Azteca is a lot more popular than you'd think from 1st look, but there's a reason people keep going back & waiting for tables during lunch. You'll leave full without hitting the wallet too hard."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Azteca. You never disappoint! Another one of my \"go - to spots\", my best friend and I frequent here. Salsa is okay. Margaritas are always good! Everything I have ordered here has been yummy. I'm obsessed with cheese enchiladas though. And the rice and beans is soo GOOD! 

They can make guac at your table. GUAC! @ THE TABLE!!! And if you're lucky, you'll get the live mariachis to sing for you. Don't forget to tip them!

Don't forget to save room for the OH SO DELICIOUS caramel cheesecake. It's a MUST HAVE!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch shortly after we landed at Charlotte airport! Fresh tortilla chips and salsa almost immediately appeared at our table when we were seated. The pork carnitas were spectacular and came with a nice variety of fillings to assemble soft tacos with. We also had the shredded beef chimichanga, which was tender and flavorful. The meal was hearty and topped with complimentary dessert of fried tortillas sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, and strawberry sauce. Would certainly go back again!"}
{"text":"2nd Time here, first was great food and drinks, 2nd time I wasn't as impressed, although my parents swear by the camerones Mexicano, which in my opinion was bland and an eye sore. The staff seemed unorganized and a bit lazy. The dishes aren't as well put together as they should be. The steak on the fajitas was a little tough."}
{"text":"08/24/11

Last meal in Charlotte before our flight.  Nice, bright atmosphere, and the restaurant was very large, which I couldn't tell walking in through the front door.  I liked the wood furniture and decor.  I had a feeling I'd been there before, but it's fairly new, and it was my first visit...

Everyone who tried the complimentary homemade chips and salsa enjoyed it.  I ordered the Two Taco combo, where I chose a soft taco filled w/ beef for myself, and gave a hard corn taco (also w/ beef) to my nephew.  Enjoyed everything else on my plate!  The \"dirty rice\" wasn't greasy, and I liked the texture and flavor of the refried beans.  Mom and sis shared a fajita combo platter, with chicken and shrimp, which they both enjoyed.  I'd sampled a juice (sorry, but forgot the name) drink that wasn't on the menu, but didn't like it- tasted like cough syrup to me, so I went ahead and ordered sweet iced tea.

Wouldn't mind going back to try their other lunch combos, or to have dinner there on our next visit to the Queen City!"}
{"text":"People need to be more friendly and genuine but food portions are big and a lot and taste good"}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill lately. And the manager wether argue with you than provide good service."}
{"text":"I am a regular here , I have come here since my granddaughter was 2 with her and before her. Tonight I was surprised. Shocked they could not get my meal correct and it's basically potato skins. Brought to me twice and not what I asked for. This really bites. 
 Everyone else food seemed to be ok but mine , I'm still sitting here waiting for the Nachos Idaho which is potato skins. More to follow.
 They said they were comping my meal third time didn't get it right either. 
 Really really disappointed. 
 Comped my meal after three tries and 1.5 hours. 
I recommend no Saturday nights.
 Jesus the bar tending do it all had to fix my meal. He could not fix the others issues but it took so long to get to him. 
 He is the guy to ask for and never fails us. 
 Tonight we were failed. How do you comp a meal and still charge for soda?"}
{"text":"Went here while in town for the weekend with a group of four, based on the great reviews.

Service was deplorable. Immediately got our drink order -- although a drink menu never showed, up so could order only what the server told us about. After drinks, was about 20 minutes before the waiter showed up again, to take our food order. The food came out and most of our group liked theirs. I found mine so-so, with the ribeye ordered medium rare and arriving somewhere between medium well and well done. 

Our requested water for the table showed up about five minutes before it was time to leave, and we ran out of drinks about 20 minutes before our waiter checked in on us after our food got dropped off.

All in all, I've had better Mexican food, but I've far better service. Maybe ours was an anomaly, given all the other ratings, but I was pretty disappointed and probably won't repeat. Only highlight was the pleasant tableside guacamole service, although even they didn't ask as to spiciness level, something I'm used to from other restaurants that make fresh guac to-oder."}
{"text":"Aztecsa is decent, but is reminiscent of a tourist trap. Kitschy decor, costumes, overpriced dishes & drinks, simple dishes were full of overly processed ingredients. My man got the fajitas (which were fresh) and I had 2 burritos. The chorizo had eggs and was the best thing we had. I'll keep looking for my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Good choice for Mexican food in Charlotte. Enjoyed the flautas as well as the cheese dip. It is one of the best cheese dips I have had at a Mexican restaurant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The short woman that answers the phone and takes to-go orders will mess it up every time.  I went inside today to place my to-go order (because I've learned over time that she can't speak english well enough to place an order over the phone, so I must go there and wait) and I thought things were going well, until I got back to work and discovered that I only had 2 of my 3 orders.  I checked the receipt, nope, she only charged me for 2...  why?  Why did she simply reduce the number of items I ordered?  SO FRUSTRATING!!!  and it happens SO OFTEN with this woman :-(  WHY does ordering food and giving you money have to be such a drag?  When my boss says he wants soup from Azteca, it now ruins my day because I know I'm going to have to deal with this woman... she's very nice and friendly, but not good at the job she's being paid to do."}
{"text":"Slow to get seated, hostess was busy playing on her phone, didn't even know I was standing in front of her. Wait staff sat me. Wait staff is fairly attentive. 5 waiters, 23 guests. Salsa was average, chips are bulk ordered.  Ordered chicken quesadilla (fajita quesadilla-chicken). 20 minutes and still no food...  food arrived after a 25 minute wait, cmon man, it's Mexican food.  Food was good though. Pedro and Alex are awesome!"}
{"text":"By far NOT the best Mexican around! This is the only Mexican place that does not seem to know how much people love chips and salsa! Come on people put some salsa on the table! What ever that is that you put on the table with chips...ITS NOT ENOUGH!!!
They are not friendly...orders are always messed up. Filling drinks....don't happen here so order 2 at the start! Be careful when ordering they call thing by different names here! Save yourself the headache and go to another minivan place this one just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some cheesy deliciousness when my significant other suggested Azteca. We started with some salsa where I was schooled in the proper way to spoon it on your tortilla chip. I found the salsa just ok- I like mine a little more chunky and less watery. We also ordered a side of guacamole which  unbeknownst to me was served table-side. 

My only real gripe came from the table-side service. While it tasted good, the \"chef\" loomed over us for quite awhile afterward in obvious attempt to garner a tip ( there was a huge tip jar tapped over the side so that it practically touched our table and  screamed \"tip me!\"). My boyfriend gave a few dollars but honestly we are tipping our servers, and paying for the Guac, why don't the table-side chefs just take a portion of the tips? I just found it to be a little tacky honestly. 

The food itself all tasted delicious. I loved my enchiladas (2nd only to La Paz), and his Arroz con pollo was great too. Drinks were filled fairly regularly and service was fine. 

The decor and lively birthday celebration singing make this a nice place for the whole family. The prices are beyond reasonable too so it's definitely budget friendly.

Best of all the little complimentary dessert, fried tortilla with cinnamon, honey, and whipped cream, was a perfect way to end the evening. 

I won't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  My co-worker turned me onto this place and it has ruined my previous favorite Mexican restaurants as there is no comparison.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food is awesome.  I always get a Number 31 with beef and their beef is seasoned so good.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Finally, I got to see what table-side guac was!  And it was so cool!  The lady comes out and asked if we wanted one or two (two is gigantic!) and then has all the spices (onions, tomato, jalapeno, etc.) and you tell them exactly how much or how little you want and you taste it until it's exactly how you want it.  Awesome experience!  The food is true to Mexican form, which is hard to find, I'm always finding Tex-Mex around here and you get HUGE portions for the price.  The plate is almost 2 feet wide.  I've never seen such a large portion.  We had the jumbo tableside guac, extra chips and salsa (which unfortunately it's not bottomless chips there :( ), 2 combo platters with 2 tacos and an enchilada, rice, beans, and cole slaw, and a complimentary dessert which they throw in like Chinese restaurants throw in fortune cookies (which was yummy) all for less than $30, plus the servings were so big I had a lot to take home.  I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes real Mexican.  I've only been able to find On the Border around here for tolerable Mexican, but I think this may beat it.  They gave us different types of salsas too.  Even the cole slaw style was good.  I wasn't really a fan of the bland one, too watery, but the second one they gave was great.  They have outside seating which was relaxing.  I wish it wasn't next to a Days Inn, but I didn't see any shady characters running around.  The bathrooms could be a little cleaner tho."}
{"text":"It was very good fresh food. We enjoyed the guacamole they make at your table side. The fajitas were enough for both of us!! We recommend  this Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Traveling through Charlotte? This is right off of I-77, open late and was a great place for a quick meal- we were in and out in about 30 minutes without being in any huge rush. It was a nice break from rest stop fast food options. 

Food was standard American-Mexican style. Lots of cheese, not terribly spicy or flavorful, really, and the standard menu choices. Portions were absolutely insane, which means a bonus snack further along your route if you take leftovers. 

We had queso, fajitas and a combination plate for $26. Plus, free sopaipillas for dessert!  Service was curt and efficient, which worked fine for us."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for really good Mexican food since we moved to Charlotte. I came across Azteca when searching on Yelp! And we decided to give it a try. Upon entering, the hostess was nice and very accommodating (we had our one year old asleep in his stroller). The ambience of the restaurant is nice, some murals, a lot of brick and Spanish tile. Once we were seated, our servers took our order and brought out chips and salsa. Both tasted store bought. There was something weird about the flavor of the salsa that I just couldn't handle. It's like they put cotija in the salsa. It gave it a really pungent taste. By pungent I mean that sour tang you taste when you have aged cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like cotija, just not in my salsa. We started with Albondigas. The broth was good, but that was it. The meatballs were so dense. It was obvious that they massaged the meat too hard. We couldn't break them apart without them sloshing in the broth. On top of that, they lacked any flavor. The potatoes and the carrots were raw and so undercooked. The only thing that was cooked correctly was the zucchini. Seriously? They serve raw vegetables in their soup?? I ordered one shredded beef taco and one cheese enchilada. My husband ordered one chicken taco, one beef taco, and one geese enchilada. My son woke up and we ordered him a simple cheese quesadilla. My son's quesadilla came out first. My first reaction was \"wtf?\" It was a quesadilla with cheese smothered all over the outside. It was everywhere and it was so greasy, it looked like it was sitting in a puddle of orange oil. I pushed it aside. There was no way I was feeding that to my son. My meal came next. It was okay. I think this restaurant uses the wrong cheese and too much of it. My entire plate was yellow. It's like there was a sale on American cheese and the restaurant was trying to use it all up. The beef in the taco was good, the shell tasted and looked store bought. My husband felt the same way about his plate. While they do have big portions, it doesn't make up for the lack of flavor, and in the case of the albondigas, it doesn't make up for the lack of edible food."}
{"text":"I was thinking \"Yeah I'll give them a 4-star review!\" but then I realized I have no experiences which led me to think they deserved less than five!

First of all I can't believe it took me so long to finally check this place out. Considering I live just around the corner and have basically commuted past it for over 4 years. When you come in you are typically greeted in Spanish with an \"Hola\" before being brought to a table. As with most Mexican restaurants they have what I would call a chip busboy. Basically a guy that is dedicated to running chips around to people that have just been seated. When you get your chips and salsa, don't forget to ask for pico as well. There is no additional charge and it is a bit spicier than the salsa. (I just dump the two together in one bowl and dig in.)

Probably the most notable thing here is the size of the plates. You're thinking \"Sure, big plates with lots of garnish. Big whoop.\" And you're right, it's one thing to have a big plate and another to fill said plate. Azteca fills 'em so you can fill your guts. Edge to edge, 360 degrees. Ever heard the saying that empty space helps compliment the items in an area? No it doesn't, fill that spot with rice, refries, salad and cheese-enchilada sauce melted over the edges. That's right Bojangles, you can keep your tiny biscuit cheese-skirt. Azteca's is bigger, better and blankets an enchilada stuffed with delicious. (Yes, delicious is a noun now.) As far as enchiladas go, I can highly recommend the menu item Enchiladas Suizas. You will be happily plump on less than $10.

Round-out your filling meal with a few of those easy-to-drink Mexican beers. Last but not least you will receive a pie-like slice of crispy sopapilla topped with a sweet cinnamon glaze and whipped cream. You might even think you could eat a whole Azteca-sized plate of these. (Let's not push it though...)"}
{"text":"This place is a jewel in the rough, and I think that a lot of people won't have the pleasure of discovering how good their food actually is. That's too bad, because this place has got some tasty treats waiting for you.

Came here with my Dad, and we had a really great meal. Their table side guacamole is great- nothing surprising, but it's nice that you can get extra jalapeño or whatever you want. I ordered the ostiones as an appetizer, and they were MAGICAL. White people, pay attention here:  ANY TIME you are at a Mexican restaurant and you see 'ostiones', you need to ORDER THEM. Similar to 'shrimp cocktail', Mexican raw oysters are a completely different animal from their guerro counterparts. The ostiones came with a delicious habañero salsa, which MADE the experience. Seriously, this is one of those things that you need to try in order to broaden your world. Get your mind right, playa.

I ordered a steak, and it was exactly what I wanted. Their bisteka a la tampiquena is spot-on, perfectly seared skirt steak with fat onions, rice, and beans. 

This is the sort of place that you need to come to if your only experience with Mexican food is a step up from Taco Bell. They have enough stuff to keep boring eaters happy, but they also have a few interesting offerings for the more adventurous-minded. Come and try something new- you might just love it!!!"}
{"text":"In another life, I used to visit the Azteca on Woodlawn at lunch with some regularity, and I have to say that I did not care for it all that much.  I have to say that this location is actually much superior, and I really cannot put my finger on just why that is, though I do have some ideas.

For one, the building is so much larger.  Housed in the former McGuffey's (that should take some of you way back), it is not the cramped little space off of Woodlawn, and that alone makes a huge difference.  Add to that a better service vibe and the quick seating provided by the larger space and you are already off and running.

Recently they have added a funky little patio out back, which unfortunately means you are looking at Independence Boulevard, but still a cool space, and you have a winning combination.  Throw in some excellent food, and your standard chips and salsa - though unfortunately they currently do not offer their super-chunky-pico unless you ask for it, and you may actually be charged (apparently due to tomato shortages).

Definitely a worthwhile stop, and you are likely to be hit lightly in the wallet, and have leftovers for the next day to boot!"}
{"text":"Came here once for lunch. It wasn't that busy and service still wasn't great. Their salsa is ok but a little bland. I got their lunch tacos with rice. I asked for soft tacos instead of hard shell and still got hard shell. No one even came to the table to check on us after we got our food. I got ground beef with my tacos and the meat was very greasy. It was so greasy, the juices soaked the hard shell by the time it got to the table. That was the exact reason why I wanted soft tacos. Their food is mediocre and so is their service."}
{"text":"Very nice decorations and ambiance including a fresh tortillas making station.  My husband and I  were there around noon on a Sunday and were seated right away In a nice booth.   Menu was full of wonderful options including lunch options that were available on weekends.  Fresh guacamole was just ok. It was prepared in the usual manner but they had aluminum foil lined in the pestle. That was a nice way to wrap up the leftovers to take home but not sure it allowed all the mixing needed. I had the chicken enchilada from the lunch menu. The chicken was white meat and tasty. The side of rice was typical but the refried beans were very tasty. My husband had the chicken chimichanga and enjoyed it about the same as some other places.   The chips didn't seem to have any salt on them. The queso was very good. Overall it was a good experience with tasty food."}
{"text":"First time being here. The decor is quite cool and the atmosphere is authentic. Even the Don Juan I had was very good. Service is average, with having to ask multiple times for things that an attentive waiter would notice. The other downside is that this is probably one of the most expensive Mexican restaurants I have ever been to in the Charlotte area. Will give it another try in the future and see."}
{"text":"If you don't get the carnita's you're doing it wrong. Server was attentive but never felt rushed. Dining room was lively for a Tuesday night but never loud."}
{"text":"Very affordable lunch meals that will fill you up.  Excellent guacamole made at your table. Super friendly staff that seems to know exactly when your chips are running low."}
{"text":"Awesome service and even better food! The waiter was very attentive and helpful. The dishes are huge! I ended up getting chicken and beef enchiladas and they were very good even though I wish they had a little more meat in them but they were cooked perfectly. The beans and rice are awesome! They turned out to be my favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"Arrived from out of town and found this gem near our hotel. Food was good, but especially enjoyed the carved wood decor and all the staff wearing World Cup soccer shirts. Staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Wasn't great but wasn't horrible. My sister and I went here on a saturday night last weekend. The main reason for choosing this place is because we were visiting out other sister who had to work that night. We had limited options of where to eat as we didnt want to go to downtown charlotte (or uptown I guess as it is called down south).......with that said we had this and two other sit down places within walking distance of the hotel we were staying at (not the day's inn that this is attached to). As my sister was craving a margarita this place was the winner. 

I liked that we got sat right away- even though it seemed busy for a saturday night around 6pm. They offered us indoor or outdoor seating and we chose the indoor. We got a booth seat stat. Our waiter was at our table in a flash. drinks out fast as werer the chips & Salsa and someone came by to offer us fresh made guac. We ordered some and it was good. Not the best but good enough. Portion sizes were decent- I got a house burrito of some sort that they were known for- it was huge. My sister got some combo plate-  taco and enchilada I think? And it came with rice and beans. Huge serving. She couldn't finish and I could barely finish mine. We left full and happy and satisified. And they gave us some treat at the end of our meal- a fried tortilla with strawberry sauce and whipped cream."}
{"text":"We came here after we left another restaurant for dinner due to their slow service and it was like night and day!  Sure- this is your typical Mexican joint, but the atmosphere, speedy service where they really cater to you, and the price is where this place sets itself apart. I got the Don Juan entree with chicken, and I had plenty to bring home. The chicken in this dish is worth the price as it's not the dried out shredded chicken in most other plates. The mushroom flavor was evident but reminded me too much of my favorite canned Cream of Mushroom.

The chips and salsa were flowing, the mariachi band kept the patrons moving, and the food was plentiful.  I'll come here anytime I need a fix of quick and tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a huge Mexican dinner and an awesome margarita. I usually get the large plate--and it's large! Mix of whatever you like, taco, enchilada with a lot of rice and beans covered in cheese on the side. You should always get a free fried dessert at the end... although the last time our server was not very friendly and didn't give us one. Usually their staff is friendly however."}
{"text":"This place is very legit. The foods come across very authentic. They have a guacamole cart and come around and make custom guacamole at your table which is awesome! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Azteca...sure....why not. I rolled in here on a Saturday afternoon while I was running some errands in the neighborhood. My craving for Mexican was taking over and Yelp led me here. 

Hubs and I were politely greeted and seated in a big 'ole comfy booth. The surroundings are reminiscent of a Chi-Chi's if you've ever had the unfortunate experience of visiting one. Mexican inspired and, well, Aztec-y. The chips were toasty and tasty but the salsa left me a bit sad. No chunks present - just watery blah. But no matter, the guacamole guy came rolling down the aisle and offered us some green magic. We asked for spicy guacamole and it was indeed full of heat...and flavor! My only gripe? For one avocado, the guac price was $7.95...that's steep IMO. 

Onto the entrees...I ordered the enchilada & tamale combo. This option came out on a massive, shallow plate. MASSIVE and covered in sauce and or cheese. Hmph. I *think* the enchilada flavors could have been nice but the cheese dumbed down most of it. The enchilada far superseded the tamale - which was super, duper bland and cakey. The refried beans and rice were standard and nothing to write home about. Meh.

While the service was friendly and efficient, the meal also ended on a sweet note with those crispy cinammon bites with a dab of whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Free little chips of wonder - I could have easily eaten five of them in a snap. Will I head back to Azteca? Perhaps, if I'm in the neighborhood and positively craving Mexican...but I'm not rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful fajita salad w/beef last night - the steak was perfectly cooked and tender. Generous sides of avocado and everything. Staying at local hotel so had it to go - best 'traveling food' I've had in a while. They were busy and still got my order done in 10 mins.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I orderee the pollo asada. It was quite delicious and the beans were delicious as well and i normally dont eat beans.  The chicken was flavorful and juicy. Only thing that could be better was the salsa because it was too watery."}
{"text":"Azteca is a fun Mexican restaurant with great people and even better food!  The interior is decorated with bright colors, Aztec patterns and designs, and the servers wear over-the-top uniforms modeled after traditional Mexican formal wear - it feels like Cinco de Mayo everyday (and gets even better ON Cinco de Mayo!).  

On weekends, a table-to-table cart makes fresh guacamole, which is incredible, and a lady makes all tortillas by hand as they're ordered.  The portions are heaping, the prices low, and the margaritas are big enough to swim in.  From what I know about REAL Mexican cuisine, the mole sauce is pretty authentic and the cactus salad is very fresh and bright.  Great time to visit is Sunday, when they have a live mariachi band that makes sure to serenade each table and takes requests.

In my humble opinion, there isn't a better Mexican restaurant in the South Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Best Albondigas Soup in the US!!!!  We moved to SC from Southern California, where we thought made the best Mexican Food, but Azteca Mexican Restaurant has it down like no tomorrow!  
My husband and I both ordered a bowl each. He went ahead and ordered the pork Carnitas, but I knew the bowl was going to be big based on the price, so I held off ordering anything else. First, our waitress brought a small bowl 1/2 filled with chopped white onion the other 1/2 filled with chopped Cilantro and on top was a slice of a lime!!!!
When the bowls of soup arrived our eyes nearly bugged out of our heads!  It was AMAZING! So amazing that we told our waitress to tell the manager and she got him for us!  Alex is a very concerned, very gracious manager. He was so happy that we were so happy!

You MUST try a Frozen Mango Margarita!  Again, the best we've ever had!!!!
By the way, the Pork Carnitas were very good also, it was just that my husbands eyes were bigger than his stomach and I was so very happy with my Albondigas Soup!

If you like really good Mexican Food, go see Alex and tell him Joe and Monica sent you  :)"}
{"text":"After moving from the west coast it has been difficult for us to find a solid Mexican restaurant until now. This place is pretty good. They are very friendly and the portions are huge! They also offer a Mexican coleslaw/pica with the chips and salsa that sounds weird but is kinda addicting haha, we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Went here in Yesterday (Aug 2016) with a crowd of 12. It was about 3:00pm. We were seated immediately and they took drink orders right then. I went to wash up and by the time I got back my drink was at the table. We ordered shortly after and we were served very quickly with really good food. It was authentic Mexican food. I have had better salsa but my Deluxe Burrito was awesome. Everyone loved their food and I can't speak highly enough about the service. Our Waiter was friendly and fast. Great experience."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. Huge potions, great chips and salsa, and this delicious chip thing that they gave us for dessert. Service was also superb -- there was so much food that we had leftovers, but they didn't bring us a bag, and I was just about so say something when a waitress came over and quietly bagged our boxes for us. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch and both times were great. Large portions and fast service. The service was good but not great. But that shouldn't stop you from having a good meal."}
{"text":"pros: large portions
cons:  taste/quality is average, service (saw waitress maybe 3 times total)

I ordered the enchiladas Rancheras but got a quesadilla instead. The food came out fairly quickly but the flavor wasn't that great. The chicken was rather dry and the tortilla was super soggy. Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things? The fried ice cream was frozen inside, meaning there were shards of ice instead of smooth ice cream. We had to flag down a server who wasn't ours several times because our waitress was nowhere to be seen after taking our order."}
{"text":"As of now this is my favorite Mexican restaurant!  I love this place!  Every time I go to Charlotte I make sure to go here!  Not only is the atmosphere here wonderful but so are the people!  The queso (cheese dip) is phenomenal.  The chips and salsa are great as well, it even comes with what I believe is Mexican coleslaw (I could be wrong on the name but it's some type of Mexican salsa lettuce thing) but I love to mix it into the salsa.  Although I may be eating it wrong, I definitely recommend mixing it with the salsa.  I always the pitcher of margaritas here.  Now if you're splitting it between two people you may not be able to finish it, it's strong and larger than it appears!  Be warned!   I think it's about 7 margaritas (or more) but it's a good amount for the price for sure! Moving on to the food mmmm delicious!  I have only ordered the tacos here so far because I'm so hooked on them I always get one soft and one hard chicken taco.  Usually at most Mexican restaurants I've been to the soft taco is always soggy because of all the juices coming from the chicken, but here it was perfectly moist and juices didn't drip down to my elbow lol.  The perfected the chicken taco! My experiences here have been nothing but great so definitely make your way here if you love Mexican and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious Mexican restaurant with good food (and lots of it--portions are huge) and quick but friendly service. My go-to order at Mexican restaurants is fajitas, and I really love the marinade they use at Azteca. The tableside guac is delightful and the margaritas are BIG. Skip the Mexican joints in the trendier parts of town and give Azteca a try."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Azteca for the past 2 years. However, my past experience wasn't pleasant. For starters the Camarónes de Mexicano was loaded with salt and the Pork Carnitas had barely any meat (mostly fat). When I explained to the waiter that the Camarónes de Mexicano had too much salt and that people at our table suffer from high blood pressure. He replied \"Next time let us know sooner so we can make the adjustment\". I find that interesting since there was more than 3/4 of the meal on the plate and the food was on our table for only 15mins.
Needless to say our frustration was reflected in the tip. There's always room for professional development or customer service training."}
{"text":"Needed to update the rating of this place as four stars is misleading.  I've been back here a couple of times through the past couple of years, and the food and service has slowly deteriorated.  The food issue was that the grub is not so good anymore and the service issue is there is a lack of attentiveness.

Came here at the start of 2014 with a friend to catch up on a busy December, but made it difficult to talk bc the restaurant was such an issue.  Trying to get the attention of a waiter, waiting on tortillas while the fajita plate got cold, and drinks empty for most of the time.  

I'm probably done here.  It feels like the quality of Mexican food is improving in Charlotte overall, so no need to rely on just this location.

dmo out."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Huge, delicious portions at a great price. I can eat here and have leftovers for days. The margaritas are also huge and delicious. 
My boyfriend ordered carnitas and loved how tender they were. I usually get a burrito azteca and take half of the plate home. 
This is a great place for if you're really hungry or just want some authentic Mexican food. Azteca is legit."}
{"text":"One of our fav. places to eat.... we will miss Ricky of course however their staff are all excellent. Food and drinks are amazing... I never have had a complaint on anything we have ordered... Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and fantastic service makes Azteca an area favorite. There is something for everyone in your groups taste on the menu. You must give Azteca a try."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for Mexican cuisine. My brother in law  uses a phrase , \"sitting on swole\", (as in swollen). This phrase aptly describes any meal from Azteca. The food is EXCELLENT and the portions are plentiful.  There is rarely a wait to be seated and if there is a wait it's well worth it. I make a hearty meal a must any time I'm  in the area. The shredded beef is OUTSTANDING! Good stuff."}
{"text":"I came here last night to meet up with a few friends. I'd never been here and wasn't too excited about it because I'd just had Mexican food last week, but decided to go simply for the fellowship. I walked in and was greeted immediately. I was the first person to get there so I got us a table. The waiter came right over and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I ordered the blue margarita which was actually really yummy. The chips and salsa were AMAZING!!! I usually ended up adding seasoning to salsa at Mexican restaurants because they're typically bland, but this salsa was perfect! I ordered a shrimp dish with rice, mushrooms, and onions and was surprised to see how big the dish was! Our food came out in a timely manner and looked amazing. I made the HUGE mistake of going to the restroom before digging in. As I walk in, I pass an employee standing at the sink texting on her phone. Out of the 3 stalls, two of them were dirty. A lady came in after me and went into the stall that I'm assuming was at least decent. I go into the lesser of two evils and, just to my luck, the door is broken and it won't close properly. UGH!! I was forced to go into the stall that needed attention and just flushed the toilet before using it but soon realized that I should've just waited for the lady to finish in the decent stall. I had no tissue!! I guess the employee was too busy making sure the text was sent to whomever to check the cleanliness of the bathroom. I go up to wash my hands and see used paper towels in one of the two sinks. I guess she couldn't be bothered enough to even throw the paper towels in the trash. Those texts must've been super important. I had to force myself not to think about what I saw in the bathroom as I went back to eat my food. I had to push the image out of my mind and try to shake it off. Yuck!! My food was DELISH and I was more than pleased. The staff needs to pay just as much attention to ensuring that restrooms are clean as they do the food because this makes for a complete experience for the guest. I would recommend this place but will warn you, use the restroom at home before coming in here."}
{"text":"I think I have said this before , but Mexican is just not my favorite food, with that said ... maybe I should reconsider, but only if we are visiting Azteca. There absolutely isn't one dish I have not enjoyed here, and the best part. Home made tortillas , not mass produced cold pockets of reheated carbs, I really could see the smiling worker making these by hand near my table . Love fresh guacamole? Tackle the member rolling the guac cart around and  get your guac specially made for you here, wait, don't tackle them... I do not want to be responsible for you hurting this wonderful person. ;)


Normally I order anything seafood related, everything has been seasoned just right and the portion sizes are huge, bring your appetite. Fresh chips with salsa while you wait for your food for free, and a tasty honey drizzled, cinnamon , whipped cream , with strawberry glaze as a  yummy dessert treat to finish. Could it get any better? YES, You must try the margaritas, especially the self dispensing vase of liquid deliciousness that can be placed on your table for numerous refills on your time ."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but my husband was not satisfied with his dish. I had the Steak with Shrimp and it was delisciuos. It had rice, beans,vegetables and huge hot pepper. Chips and salsa tasty but salsa could be alittle bit thicker. They gave you a free little tortilla chip with whip cream and strawberry drizzle on it. It was tasty. Friendly and good service. My husband had the Chicken Fahitas. He ordered them due to the reviews. He would have preferred larger strips of Chicken instead of small leftover pieces. I will be back with my mama to try again but probably not my husband."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  My husband and I frequent Azteca when we have a taste for cheese enchiladas, since theirs are some of the best.  

Their salsa is very good, and somewhat spicy.  For starters, we like their queso dip and made-at-your-table guacamole (although I don't think they add lemon or lime to theirs?).  

But the main course is almost always their cheese enchiladas, served with beans and rice.  They are larger than usual, and FULL of cheese.  Their beans used to taste like the canned variety, but they are much better now.  I like their rice as well.  Platters are huge, and we both always have leftovers.

As others have mentioned, service can be hit or miss.  It really depends on who you get.  Either way, we always return, because we just haven't found better cheese enchiladas in CLT."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food Charlotte but definite top five. Great family place. Have live mariachi music occasionally too. Good food and reasonably priced. Large restaurant, good for parties. Always a fun time."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get Mexican. I visit this location often and have an excellent experience. Food is always excellent and the queso is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Here is what I didn't like about This place. 

My food was underwhelming and just plain.  I ordered a taco salad and asked for grilled shrimp instead of beef or chicken.  They were going to charge me extra which I said was fine but when she said it would be $7.99 extra I almost fainted.  Why can't they substitute for the same price? Or only charge me a few bucks extra? My salad was only $8.00 so there was NO way I was paying $15 or some shrimp and iceberg lettuce.  I went with chicken.  It was so bland in taste.  I only had a few bites and didn't even eat the rest.  :-( Quacamole was good but that's about all she wrote."}
{"text":"New to town my boyfriend and myself went due to the raving reviews. HonestLY we were pretty disappointed. I used to work in a Mexican restaurant that was rating the best by the state and I didn't recognize half the food. Also I though it was strange my dish came with  coleslaw....and I'm pretty sure it was spoiled. The food was mediocre , but not excellent. My boyfriend insisted the chips tasted like sweat. BUT the reason I WONT go back is their margaritas. You get the choice of size and flavor, that's it . I figured I start off with a basic strawberry and I had 2 by the end of the meal. They were not worth it. 4 margs came to $34!! I was baffled. PASS"}
{"text":"I'm traveling through Charlotte for business from Houston. I'm a big lover of all things Mexican.

Let me start by saying that the staff here are fun.  I love authentic places and this place had a lot going on.  I sat at the bar and ordered margaritas that were amazing.

I would rather go for an independent place rather than a chain and I'm so glad that I did!!! I love this place. Tacos on point. Authentic. 

If you are in Charlotte especially traveling stop by!"}
{"text":"It's on our regualr rotation . Great table side gauc, Good service and for the past 11 years it doesn't let us down. More food then you can eat in three days and always a fun time. I love the Chicken con crema, the ceviche, the tortilla soup. The fried ice cream yadda yadda really a stand by for us"}
{"text":"Really not impressed. It was so crowded and took forever to get a seat. For two of us, too. Very generic Mexican food and not even that great."}
{"text":"Okay, having been raised in So Cal, don't expect So Cal. But, you can get close, since once you tell them that you want REAL queso in the enchilada and not cheddar they will give you the Mexican white queso.  The enchilada sauce is more Texas style, so you may want to go Verde.  The carne asada is quite good! get a side of pico de gallo and toss it in your salsa and you'll be fine.  I special order my margs, and the staff finally has seen my fat face enough to know how I like them."}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would! Amazing food! The carne asada is so yummy! I'm from CA and picky when it comes to Mexican food, but this place didn't let me down. Absolutely amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Best old-school Mexican restaurant in town. Service, quality of food, and ambiance all deliver above what we're all used to. Don't miss the Arroz Con Pollo!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent at this place.  The salsa is rather thin, but it has a good flavor.  The cabbage mix here was basically flavorless.  It is much better at other locations.  

It was a Friday night and very busy, but we were seated immediately.  The server wasn't very personable or friendly.  He wouldn't spilt items on the bill for us and was overall rude.  He mostly had other people bringing out our food items and refilling drinks.  He also never checked back to see how everything was.  

Not a bad experience, I would try again one day if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Very slow service!!! It's such a shame, because I do enjoy the food. The last 3 times I went, I couldn't get refills or order my sides (like extra ranch) because they never came back to the table!!! I love the pico they serve. Food is always great! Service sucks."}
{"text":"This place offer large portion of food, nice service but the complementary chips/salsa was not fresh and the food was not extraordinary.
I am not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Something hilarious about this Azteca outpost being attached to a slightly retro Day's Inn. Love the weird, ad hoc additions to the architecture - thatched roof beverage station awkwardly built into a corner, odd wood and glass entry hallway made more cramped by the quarter-for-a-bronco-ride thingy. 

Everything here is slightly more compressed than the Matthews location - booths narrower, tables closer. Service more harried because they do a LOT more business here - even at a slightly off time for dinner, the place was hoppin'. 

I could be imagining things, but I feel like prices were 50 cents higher than the other location, hmm. Servings were a tad smaller, for sure, but you don't need to finish that arm-sized burrito, anyway. 

Onto the food: I got the Macho Burrito, he got the usual (fajitas). Now, I've had the Macho at Don Pedro, the other Azteca location, and here - it's a nopales burrito, so it's full of pickled cactus. This was by far the best version I'd had - because the jalapenos were fresh, so it wasn't almost too salty to eat (which, admittedly, has never stopped me from ordering it before). Goooood. A mild, almost mozzarella queso was used instead of the monterey jack I'm used to, continuing the low-sodium thing (except for the nopales). Awesome.

Fajitas were, well, Azteca Fajitas - smothered in sweet teriyaki-style flavors. Weird.

I'd come back if I were in the nabe and had a serious burrito craving, but I'd probably be thinking about the taco trucks and taquerias down the street the whole time."}
{"text":"Azteca is rad for a number of reasons: huge portions (come here for lunch, they have 4-5$ specials!), super-sweet waitstaff, and great decor. There's a smoking lounge here that's a mix of villa and sports bar, with high-backed booths and hanging fake foliage. Classic.
Veggie fajitas are awesome, but odd- stir-fried with a teriyaki-style sauce, the flavors aren't super-authentic. The same can be said of most of the menu, although admittedly, I'm missing a lot of it, being vegetarian. But for comfy, ameri-mexican, this place is tops. When they seat you, make sure to ask for the tomatillo sauce-- it's tasty and authentic, and if you're feeling the need to nosh on an over-sized bowl of pickled jalapenos with your meal, it will only run you a dollar for the side."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when you are in the mood for mexican food in Charlotte. Here's why it's a 5 star in my book:

1. Service AND Friendliness: Always great and consistant. I've been coming here over the last 2 years and the service is always quick to please and friendly.

2. Food: The quality, quantity and variety of food they offer is wonderful. I've brought many people here from work over the last 2 years and not one person has had an \"average\" meal for lunch or dinner. 

Their guacamole, super nachos, cheese dip, table salsa and chips, their beef, chicken and picadillo (my favorite) as well as the other things we've had on the menu..... it's simply very good to great food and the portions and prices are great. 

Bottom line is that its a great place to eat at for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Tried Azteca for the first time Friday. Certainly an authentic Mexican feel. The staff was friendly, as we were seated right after a five minute wait. I ordered the camerones del mojo y ajo (shrimp with garlic and lime/lemon). I've had it at different restaurants and this was NOTHING like it. Be prepared that the onions are large pieces that come on a bed of lettuce. Only halfway through my meal did I realize there was rice underneath. They leave the shrimp in the shell, which is a pet peeve of mine, as it makes eating a chore. However, the taste of the shrimp was good and strongly garlic flavored. My date had shrimp and fish with some kind of nuts that he enjoyed. We also had guacamole, which was not good. It lacked lime and salt (date enjoyed it though). Overall, I would recommend Azteca. Just be careful about what you order, as it may not be what you expect. I'm probably overrating this place because the service was good and my date liked it more than me."}
{"text":"You Got my Margarita perfect! 
I don't like it icey, but more like a Italian Ice style. It was Perfect! 
Also loved that it wasn't heavily loaded down with lime flavoring, most other restaurants do this to hide the lack of alcohol, not this place! Also, BEST Salsa around! 
They come around to your table and make fresh Guacamole if you want it.
I like our normal booth we get (the hole) it's comfortable for someone, like me, with anxiety in public places.  I would be leaving 5 stars if the meat was different.. we don't care for the flavor of the ground beef. 
Customer Service was great!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way to the airport. It's connected to a Days Inn so I had to question how good it was going to be. But given the clientele I would say the food is authentic. The menu offers lots of choices and the beer and ritas are good. So why the three stars? The service sucked. I was there with a relative who lives in Charlotte and we ordered light (me nachos and she the tres Leche cake, both good) and we were basically ignored for the entire time we were there. The food took so long to come out that we both joked about it. But honestly I was pissed about how long it took to get two simple dishes to our table and about how little attention we were paid. So, food good, drinks also good, service sucked."}
{"text":"My experience with the food here is always bleh- the dishes always taste like something is missing. I tried their shrimp n chicken burrito this time. The taste didn't wow me. The sauces are to watered down. Needs more flavor."}
{"text":"Food was good, but overpriced. This is a gringo's restaurant, not one for Mexicanos. With so many choices, I would only come back if looks were most important."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Traditional mexican menu.  The highlight was definitely the guacamole which was made fresh and to our taste right in front of us.  The tacos and quesadillas were good, but a bit soggy.  Service was great.  Would definitely recommend stopping by just for the guac."}
{"text":"When I'm thinking of going to a Mexican restaurant I never think of Azteca, but my friends always seem to love it there.  I can't say I have never had anything there that I didn't like, the food really isn't bad, its just not amazing by any means.  The service can be hit or miss, but they area always friendly.  The place is rather small, and connected to a Days Inn Hotel.  The prices are also not bad.  I have never had a Margarita there so I can't review that.  So for me its a place I would never turn down if suggested, but I just would never suggest it myself....lol."}
{"text":"Tonight we had to walk out of my favorite Mexican restaurant. After being seated immediately in the dining room, in the front, first booth behind the register. The restaurant wasn't very busy maybe 8 to 12 people in the dining room, but there was no wait staff to be seen, after waiting more than 10 mins for someone to acknowledge our presence my husband decided to grab the closest waiter and asked him to help us. Instead of being apologetic for making us wait, because he had already taken and returned with a drink order of a couple that came in after us, he was rude and snapped stating \"I am coming now!\" and we told him what we would like to drink and before he left I asked him if we could go ahead and place our dinner order(since we had been waiting a long time already and had more than enough time to look over the menu) and he reluctantly said yes. Ok I've lived here in Charlotte all of my life and I've been eating here since I can remember, I ordered one of my usuals chicken chimichanga no onions please, when the waiter quickly spoke up and said I could not order chicken chimichangas without onions... Wait? What? 
So in order to avoid what was already to be a very bad dining experience. I just excused ourselves and left... Im very disapointed with Azteca.. And I can't say I will never return but in the years I have been eating there I've had slow service but this was blatently rude and unwilling to accomodate..."}
{"text":"Guac is always a good idea, especially if it is made fresh next to your table. There is a small and a large option. The small is one avocado and was great for two people to share. We asked for everything, which from what I could quickly see was tomatoes, onions, parsley and jalapeños and the juiciest lime you could ever squeeze. She made it so fast and I loved that she let me try it after she was done. It was good the first time but I ended up adding more jalapeños because I was feeling for something spicy. PRO TIP: She travels with a tip jar on her cart and so have some dollars handy for her personal attention. 

Carne Asada was the entree of choice. The meat was tender and portion was huge. It included beans, rice, pico and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I also got a mango margarita, the mango mix was a little heavy but I knew it was to cover up the tequila and I'm never mad at a heavy pour. The food was very satisfying. The service was great despite being almost completely packed for Sunday Lunch."}
{"text":"I think we found a good one!  You could officially call me a fan of Azteca.   I came here with a party of 11.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I, personally, could have used a little more kick, but what can I say?  I'm a spicy kind of guy!

The margaritas are phenomenal here!  Between my fiancée and I, we ordered a pitcher.  My 3 enchiladas were absolutely awesome.  

Service was great!  They even came out and sang happy birthday to our friend.  Awesome job Azteca.  I shall be back!"}
{"text":"THE most horrible dining experience. The worst customer service. Drinks were bad. Complained and asked for a different drink after a small swig. They refused. Ok. Sucked it up. Food came out horribly. Manager came out after we complained of food and told my  dining companions that her problem was that she talked too much! What? Then brought out the menu (which they had 2 different ones) and asked if we pointed to the picture for the order. Really? Saying we need to call the owner. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER CHEESE ENCHILADAS.   I got á la carte cheese enchiladas.   How can u mess that up, right?? Wrong!!   I am adding a pic to show everyone.  They were covered with cheddar cheese. Weird but I went with it.   The cheddar is also inside.  No white cheese.  Shredded cheddar cheese throughout.  Wtf??   It was nasty nasty Nasty."}
{"text":"I went to Azteca this Christmas for lunch. As you would guess, dining options for lunch on this day are few and far between. I drove past the restaurant, noticed there were about 15 cars there, and being familiar with the chain with other locations in Charlotte, said \"what the heck,\" and pulled in.

This time around I got the Fajita Nachos with steak (you can also order it with chicken), and asked the server to add lettuce and jalapeños. She was polite, asked how my holidays were going, and did a great job making sure that I had everything I needed throughout the time I was there. All of the toppings were fresh, the chips were still warm, and the mixture of everything was just about perfect. What I was most impressed with was the taste of the steak. I believe they marinate the steak, and that gives the meat a certain sweetness that ties everything together. If I could make one suggestion, I would be to maybe cut down a little bit on the amount of green/red peppers that are in the recipe.

Overall, I was very happy with my choice on where to eat Christmas Day lunch. It's a meal that your expectations are somewhat high on, but it's so easy to be let down because of the number of options. The only reason I'm not giving this Azteca 5 stars is because of the salsa that's served as an appetizer, as they do at all Mexican restaurants. It's mediocre at best. The salsa they serve lacks texture, and almost resembles a salsa that has been watered down, with green onions added. If my memory serves me correctly, I wasn't impressed with the salsa that other Azteca restaurants in Charlotte served.

Oh yeah, ask for their homemade house hot sauce! It's a type of salsa verde that made up for their red salsa that's served with the tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  We got a shrimp entree and a chimichannga. Both were delicious!  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the chicken was moist!  Definitely will be back when in the area. Yum and the margaritas were pretty tasty too!!"}
{"text":"The food is sometimes hit or miss, but pretty good more often than not. The daiquiris are ALWAYS good and a really good size for the price. This is a midpoint between a friend and I so we meet here often for dinner and a drink. I've never had to wait long for a table but they can be busy at times. There is also always a large party. Seems to be very popular for celebrations!"}
{"text":"I started going here years ago and the reason I always come back is for two things---the salsa and the Deluxe Burrito. It has been consistently wonderful for years. You get a fresh, awesome, slightly spicy (but overall mild) salsa and a carolina style salsa with cabbage that is fresh and delicious. Their chips are always fried well and never greasy or stale tasting. 

If your first thought when contemplating a Mexican restaurant is if their salsa is good (as is usually mine), then definitely eat here. But this location not the other ones because I've had way different experiences at the others."}
{"text":"Great service.  Fresh ingredients. Large menu."}
{"text":"When I entered the location I wasn't greeted and just stood there for a minute before I walked to the bar. While at the bar still didn't get waited on. After 10 min a gentleman asked if I needed help and the rest of the meal was great which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. The food was amazing and not to pricey at all."}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican meals I have ever had. Staff was really nice and attentive, but this place is clearly catering to gringos. Burrito lunch special was listed $5.99, bill came and I was charged $6.75 pretax. Not a huge deal, but change your menu if the prices aren't accurate. Also the burrito had very little chicken and was slathered with half a pound of cheddar cheese. Next time I'll drive down to Central for something a bit better."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Delicious Mexican food. Great staff. Incredible salsa that tasted freshly made. The decor is beautiful and menu selection is great. This is definitely our new go-to spot for Mexican. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because prices are a little high...my margarita was $8...and it wasn't bad but it did taste mostly like mixer. I hope to come back when there's some good drink specials."}
{"text":"We go here regularly and the restaurant is a family favorite. We've eaten most items on the menu and the grandsons love the fajitas."}
{"text":"I am giving Azteca 1 star for a few reasons. I called in my food at 3:33pm. Given that it's not during the dinner rush, I expected my food to get done quickly. They told me it would be ready in a, reasonable, 15 minutes. 15 minutes later I arrived to pick up my food. I told them what I was waiting for, then stood and waited another 45 minutes (one hour total time) for my food to come out. After waiting one hour I was told that my two burritos would be $38. I told them that must be a mistake, as all I ordered was two chicken burritos. There was no way they could be $19 a piece. I did add cheese to them, which I agreed to the $1.25 up charge for. They insisted that the price was right, and my two chicken burritos would be $38. (Side note: I recently went to chilis and shared two margaritas, an appetizer, two dinner entrees, and a desert, for $35)

One hour of wait time, and $38 later, I left with two mediocre chicken burritos that I could have gotten for significantly cheaper at most any other Mexican restaurant in the area. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food, drinks, staff. I would go every week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"I love Azteca!  My family has been eating here for over 10 years.  The food and service is excellent. Some could consider this to be Tex-Mex but it is more authentic Mexican food with local favorites like Arroz Con Pollo.  If you're searching for good Mexican food, look no further!  I highly recommend this restaurant and specifically the Woodlawn location for the authenticity."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, good food and there was even a lady that made fresh guacamole right at the table; it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for over a decade! I've always loved the service and food. It has been years since I last visited Azteca and it was not one of my best experiences here. Came in with 4 other ladies around 1:30pm on a Monday. When we walked in the manager or owner (one of the two) was on the phone taking an order. She \"sensed\" us standing there (she didn't look up), put the phone down (didn't put it on hold) and started to pile up menus. A waitress appeared and this lady tells her to take the order on the phone, in a very unprofessional manner to the point I was ready to walk out at that moment and I'm sure the person on the phone could hear everything. Of course this set my mood for the meal, since I'm so familiar with this place and I was with my in-law family who were visiting from another country, I started to notice EVERYTHING. The menu is basically the same as 10 years ago with higher prices. Some of the meals are overpriced for the quality of them (sopa de mariscos/seafood soup). My meal had a modification, instead of refríes beans I asked for charro beans, they were cold. My mother in law noticed that the taco salad she always gets, was only filled half way unlike other times it is over the top. Server was great and accommodating, however I was waiting for a refill throughout my whole meal. From this recent experience I will most likely double think spending my money here when I know there is better out there for less."}
{"text":"Unbelievable carnitas and margaritas!!  Highly recommend this place - looks like a dump but don't let that fool you!"}
{"text":"First timer earlier this week and food was great! In fact, going back tonight...Attn: Vegetarians like me, the Expresso vegetarian burrito is great! Especially with the cheese dip drizzled over the top nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I have previously mentioned my love for Mexican food so I have been to this restaurant more times then I care to share but I am just now getting around to writing about it!

In MY opinion, this is the best Mexican restaurant I have been to in terms of authenticity.  I know there are a lot of trendy mexican-fusion type joints but this is just your old fashioned get your grub on type Mexican.


The GOOD:  The salsa is very good...fresh ingredients give it a little bit of chunk and the flavor is perfect.  It is a little runny but I don't like salsa that has been thickened by paste or because it was pureed.  I would rather the flavor with chunks of onion and pieces of cilantro--and that is what this place offers.  


The BAD--They serve the salsa in a very small dish and they have a disclaimer on the menu that indicates only the first two rounds of chips and salsa are free.  I mean, what?  I understand we are in a tough economic situation but you can't be a mexican restaurant and charge for chips and salsa.  We have managed to avoid that extra charge so far.  We usually just ask a different person for more salsa every time...I know, a little dishonest, but I can't help it!  I expect a charge when you go to some random place and happen to order chips and salsa as your appetizer (like Chili's or something) but any standard, hole-in-the-wall Mexican place should NOT do such a thing.



THE EXCELLENT:  Their fresh, tableside guacamole!  WOW!  I had no idea avocados could have so much flavor.  It was fantastic.  The flavors were bold and boasted of fresh cilantro, onion, and lime!  It was such a perfect combination of flavors.  I have had it with the jalapenos and without...either way was incredible!  



I typically get the veggie fajitas and that is another reason why I love this place.  TYPICALLY, if I order veggie fajitas I end up with onions and peppers marinated in salt.  Azteca sends out grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes, squash, broccoli and mushrooms.  They are not weighted down with sodium and dripping in a fajita sauce....they are grilled and fresh.  It really is perfectly done!



The beans and rice and pretty basic--nothing to speak about.  The flour tortillas are great and their pico de gallo is fresh and flavorful.


One other downfall is that they don't give you the option for black beans on the side.  But, what I found out is that black beans are not as authentic in terms of Mexican food.  Muy interesante!



It is definitely worth checking them out...even if it is just for their guacamole.  You may want to bring your own jar of salsa though....just kidding"}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican meals I have ever had. After waiting an hour for the food !!! The food arrived salty, well done and dry !! The waitress offered to replace the meal and it took another 30 minutes. Basically we lost our appetite waiting for the food . Told the waitress not to bring the food out and asked for the manager !!! And sure enough he came and start arguing with me and my friend about the food not being salty !!! said he tried it and it taste just fine !!!! REALLY DUDE???? I said It is salty and this is not the first time I come here nor the first time I order this meal !! He said sorry but all I can so is offer you 50% off of your bill and we actually returned the plates full after taking one bite so basically we paid for something we did not even eat!!!!! He was worried about getting his $$$ not providing good customer service. This manager sucks and he need to learn some customer service !!!!"}
{"text":"Azteca is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  If you go there you'll see why, tons of charm and the food is amazing!!

Great atmosphere at lunch or dinner time!  They have a tons of cheap lunch specials and you get a ton of food.  Plus, all you can eat chips, salsa and Mexican slaw...Yum!!

One of my favorite dishes they serve is the Carnitas Des Reyes (I think that's how it's spelled!)!  Sliced beef strips in a tomato-ey sauce with green peppers and onions.  Served with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, rice, beans and guacamole.  The beef is so tender and has a ton of flavor.  If you've never tried it before, please do!  If you like fajitas, you would like that dish!

I've also had their fajitas and they are the best around!  I don't think I've had a bad meal there.  

Service is always great and fast, especially at lunch time.

Oh, and at the end of your meal you get these wedges of tortillas dusted with sugar and drizzled with honey and strawberry sauce, topped with whipped cream!  One of my favorite desserts ever and you get it with your meal!  Yum!!

Don't let the fact that it's attached to a Days Inn make you not want to go in.  Just keep your focus on the food and atmosphere and you'll forget that the hotel is even there!!"}
{"text":"Azteca is tucked behind a hotel in a strip of other restaurants and shops. Parking is a breeze and there is a lot of indoor seating. 

They have complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa has a slight kick so sensitive tongues be careful! I ordered a margarita... it was nice and strong. Such a shame that they don't offer specials.


I ordered a chicken quesadilla and the bae ordered a chicken burrito. The food came out quickly and was delicious. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was pretty good. I didn't care for the sour cream that much but it didn't ruin my meal. 

Service was good and I had no complaints. Overall, this place is pretty solid, especially for the area."}
{"text":"1st off, this restaurant is located literally connected to a Days Inn. Yes, it's somewhat connected to hotel. Due to the location, parking sucks. But atleast you can walk off the extra calories. Decor is traditional. Bathroom is way to small for the amount of people inside. 

Service was good. The only complaint I have is that you have to pay at the register at the hostess area. It just leads to a huge cluster of people up front if it's busy so you have to awkwardly stand around and be maneuvered around for those that need to be seated. 

Food was delicious. I got the Quesadilla with chicken, rice and beans. It was really good and was the perfect size. They have lunch specials too and servers are available to answer questions."}
{"text":"I was a little wary about this place. From the outside, it looks super sketch because the restaurant is semi-attached to a Days Inn. It's awkwardly positioned to the right of the hotel. But hey, sometimes that's where you get the most authentic food.

Walking in, that's when I realized, it was very cultured and decked out. I felt like I walked into an Aztecan temple filled with golden chairs/walls/tables, you name it. It may have been the color of the wood and the light that was shining just right. I felt like I needed to offer a human heart in return for my food. But we'll save that for another time ;)

The menu, like any traditional mexican restaurant was expansive. Average price around $7-12, so pretty good. I think there were over 60 items on the menu. I ultimately chose the Avocado Tostada and an enchilada. My friend got 2 tacos and an enchilada. While we were waiting for our food, the chips and salsa came out. Chips were the same as any mexican restaurant, however the salsa came with two different types: a cabbage blend and the regular salsa. The cabbage salsa was unique and sweet. Usually cabbage is bitter but it was rather pleasant. We also ordered some queso to go with the chips. 

I would say the only caveat about this place was the service. It was a bit slow and forgetful. We ordered the queso and we didn't receive it until we got our meal (which was 20 minutes after we ordered). Water refill was slow if not at all (we had to hail down our waiter). Let me tell you though, it was alot of queso, so definitely your money's worth. When we got our food, it was served on this gigantic plate (~20 inches wide). The food was spread out, but it was still alot of food. Avocado tostada was a bit disappointing as I only got 2 small chunks of avocado.

Regardless, the experience was amazing. We got sopapillas at the end. It's essentially fried chips with a sprinkle of strawberry drizzle and powdered sugar. Nice way to polish off the lunch. Til next time amigos."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone sees in Azteca. I have been several times since 2013, my last review, and am just not impressed.
Service is always horrible and I always feel very rushed! They try and turn tables and it is not a good customer experience. 
As for the food, the salsa is runny and the cabbage slaw always has a rancid flavor. As for entrees, nothing really stands out. Most recently I got the fajitas and the Chicken wasn't great and the vegetables were even cooked. The beans and rice are okay but I feel like they sit on the plates and get heated up right before being served. Half the time the rice a overcooked because of that.
I will say the fresh made guacamole is good. Definitely don't pass that up.
Drinks are not fresh...the Margarita tastes like a pre-made mix, very sour. Learn to make a fresh Margarita.

There are definitely better Mexican options in my mind and probably will not return."}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  Food is out of this world (my favorite is the Carne Asada) and everything is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Our go-to Mexican place.  The fresh guacamole is reason alone to go here. They make it table side and you can let them know what you want in it. Always good to bring a couple of bucks for the guacamole cart tip jar.  Service is usually good and they will customize plates however you want. Not too expensive."}
{"text":"Frozen margaritas and tres leches cake for us tonight. \"best tres leches on this side of the boarder\" they say and I agree."}
{"text":"Used to be really good, but I guess they got too comfortable. I used to be a regular here. Then I went once earlier this year and noticed a huge downgrade in quality of the food & ingredients used and in the service provided. Hoping it was just a bad day- I went back again but had the same less-than-stellar experience. Don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"2 young adults and 2 adults.  Extensive menu.  Excellent service but it was only 5:30pm on a Friday and the music was blaring way too loud and I asked for them to please turn it down.  We could not hear each other talk.  Tableside Guac fantastic.  I asked the waitress for onions for my  cheese enchiladas.  She asked me if I wanted them on the inside or on top I said I would love them on the inside.  I never got any onion at all but we had so much food on the table (Guac, nachos, then the main courses that it didn't matter by then).  If you look at Map Quest or Google maps it shows you making a right turn into the restaurant where there is no road.  It shows a dotted line where you drive thru a ditch and bushes! LOLOLOL  We had already figured it out before we got there. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Five years later, still good. Azteca has all the stuff you would want in a Mexican restaurant - Telemundo on the television, burritos and tacos, rice and beans, imported beers from south of the border, chips and salsa, and a wait staff that understands enough English to bring you a carne asada with flour tortillas.

Food is good. Chips are good. Salsa is good. It's A-OK."}
{"text":"For Mexican food, I love to visit this Azteca location.  The service is excellent and they will substitute items on the menu.  As a shrimp lover, a favorite dish is the Carnitas Camarones which is prawns sliced and fried with onions, green peppers and mushrooms served with rice and beans.  They usually have a margarita special (mango = yummy) along with a beer special.  The restaurant is always crowded for dinner on the weekends.  Although the restaurant is pretty large, I suggest you arrive before the dinner time hour so that you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Food was simply amazing! Our waitress was sweet, polite and quick. We watched as tortillas were made fresh in front of us. I recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Azteca on Woodlawn since I was a little kid. It has always been my favorite mexican restaurant in Charlotte and never dissapoints! Their queso is the best and the chicken enchiladas are my go to dish! You  cant go wrong with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Very ethnic feel. I appreciate that they are open late. I bought dinner for my dad and he almost ate the plate!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  Been a while. I keep forgetting about this place even though it is basically across the street from my office.  But it is buried deep in a strip mall type area. 

Anyway the lunch was great. I had a deluxe beef burrito. It was huge. Otherwise nothing unusual at all. But very fresh, tasty, and satisfying. 

Service was friendly and prompt. Prices average for this type of spot. 

All in all a winner. Not a go out of your way place. But if you're in the area, and feel like Mexican food, worth the stop"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch to go. I had the chimichanga lunch plate that came with rice and refried beans. They also gave me chips and salsa, which I was not expecting because I though they only gave that to customers who would dine in, so that was a special treat. Now the food, was okay. Nothing spectacular. My rice I don't think it was cooked all the way because there were some grains in there that were hard as if they were not cooked all the way. The ground beef in my chimichanga to me it did seem a little on the cheaper cut of beef.  Ur overall, I liked my food. The restaurant was nicely decorated and it seemed liked a good atmosphere. I would recommend this Mexican restaurant if you're in the area...I just have to try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Kids menu: B, we didn't actually see the kids menu but the server said they could do just about any item on the menu in a kids size. So for that, they get a B!

Kids review: The beef and bean burrito had too many beans, not enough meat. We liked the rice and beans. And churros!

Parents review: We only ordered beverages on this visit Order the top shelf margarita, so smooth and not too sweet! They also have Dos Equis Amber on draft served in tall, icy mugs. The food looked fine but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Loved this Mexican restaurant! Great food, ambiance and drinks! I'd go back here anytime!"}
{"text":"I am from New York and was visiting Charlotte with the boyfriend. He loves mexican food. So we decided on this place because of the great reviews. We arrived and was served with house tortilla chips and salsa. The salsa was a bit too spicy for me but the tortilla chips were hot and were good. I ordered the chicken carnitas and the boyfriend ordered the arroz con pollo. The food arrived in extra huge plates and it was not what we expected. The food was delicious but it was so much that we both couldnt finish it. I would recommend this place to friends who are visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"It was 7pm on a Sunday, St. Patricks day, and we were out-of-towners looking for dinner near our hotel in Charlotte.  We were surprised to find that most restaurants were closed.  Azteca was the fourth one that we tried and, finding it open, decided to give it a try.

When we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  There was a plate of food on display which looked kind of congealed and gross - it had probably been there the whole day - and made me question whether dinner there was a good idea.

There was no wait for our table.  When we were seated, they promptly brought us delicious chips and salsa.  Our waitress was very kind.  We ordered four different dishes and shared - they were all fabulous.  Large portions for great prices.  There was also a woman walking by with a cart making fresh guacamole on request.  She was adorable and I loved that she made it right in front of us.

Overall, Azteca was not a place I probably would have chosen first but I'm really glad we stumbled upon it.  A great find!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here for a late night with my family  on 7.23.16. I was actually trying to decide  between Don Pedro's and Azteca . I decided to go to Azteca since I had never been before . Upon reviewing the menu , I noticed it looked eerily familiar to Don Pedro's, after chatting with the waiter it was confirmed that they are more or less the same restaurant and share the same menu , interesting !

Anyways  back to the dinner , the waiter took our order without  any issues and came by to see how we were doing prior to our food  coming out and seemed  like a pretty nice guy . Unfortunately that was the last we heard of him ,He just disappeared after that .  The food came out and everything was ok .   A lady named  Ana ( who seemed really nice ) , was able to get our check and let us pay . I was never told of what happened to our waiter .

 Within hours of eating the food ( Fiesta Chimichanga and chips and salsa) an explosive sickness came over me like no other and left me running to the  bathroom from 4am to nearly 10am . Yikes !!!   I definitely didn't order a side of food poisoning or whatever that was , with my chimichanga . Nonetheless I'm glad it didn't last too long and after about a day I'm feeling pretty darn good again :) . Probably won't be going to either Don Pedro's or Azteca for quite some time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hidden up in the North Lake mall area, but it is great!  I did not have high hopes for it, but I have been there 3 times now, and each time has been awesome.

The Margaritas are huge! (order the Cabo Wabo margarita)  The juices are fresh and the tequila is strong.  Two of these will set you up nicely for the evening, and they aren't even that expensive.  

For food, the queso is delicious, but the real highlight is the steak quesadilla.  The steak is delicious and has soo much flavor.

I love coming here, even though it is 15+ mins outside of the city.  It's under the radar, but I will keep returning."}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try. Went on a Monday night not crowded at all. When we sat down the waiter was quick with the salsa and some type of slaw. Had the table side guac made and it was excellent. The food came out quick and was very hot and good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. The bartender knows how to make a good margherita on the rocks! That's always a plus. I wouldn't skip desert either. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid authentic Mexican food with an interesting vibe. Not sure if I'd take out of town guests here since it's in a Days Inn, but overall has great service and food is priced well."}
{"text":"Quick, efficient, good food, excellent drinks, average priced.
We went on Cinco De Mayo and it was great! Great environment and everyone had a great time, will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.....GIANT beers and awesome food. Got the 2 Burrito plate with chile verde and chorizo. The rice is fantastic also."}
{"text":"My second favorite Mexican Resturant in the area. Outstanding chips and salsa. The BEST table side guacamole anywhere.  Any of the steak dishes are amazing. Great service always.  And a large beer is a LARGE beer. Truly a outstanding restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are one of those people who say the guac ( and not the guacamole) at Cantina is so delicious... you either 1) have not been to Azteca or 2) are too drunk from the margarita to notice that it's bland.

Azteca is the place to go for Mexican because it is authentic and has more to choose from than just tacos and buritos (although it does have them).  When you sit down the server automatically brings you a basket of hot freshly made chips, salsa and awesome pica de gallo.  You should also order the guacamole that is prepared table side.  They cut the avacado right there in front of you and add the ingredients (e.g. onion, cilantro, lime jalapenos, salt, pepper, etc.) based on your taste (more spicy please).  Not like other restaurants who claim they make the guac in front of you but bring out already cut avacado and pre-measured ingredients and spices. 


Azteca has a huge menu and everything I've ever ordered have been delicous.  And I've had quite a few things such as queso, guacamole, carne asada, pork carnitas, steak fajitas, seafood soup, fried snapper, puerto vallarta and other dishes.  When you order your food they give you the option of flour or fresh made corn tortillas.  Definitely get the fresh corn tortillas or ask for it if they don't tell you about it.  They also give you complimentary sopapillas drizzle with honey and strawberry sauce top with whipped cream.  Every time I eat there I feel like they have to wheel me out because they give you so much food but I still look forward to and save room for the sopapillas.

Also I don't think I've mentioned how wonderful their service is.  My boyfriend drinks a lot of sweet tea and they never leave his cup empty.  All the servers are super nice and accommodating.   We go there so often that the people there know we like to sit in the outdoor section (when weather permits of course).  This southern girl can't handle the cold too well.

OOHHH. I forgot to mention, their margaritas are delicious.  They also have margarita specials Mon - Thurs.  Definitely try one.  It's a great place to have dinner with your significant other or a large group of friends.  The mariachi band also add a fun element to your dining experience.  The band is at the Woodlawn location on Friday nights and at the Independence location on Sunday nights.  Ask them to play something crazy and look forward to a good time!!!"}
{"text":"Recommend getting the large guacamole with everything on it and a lot of lime juice for your appetizer"}
{"text":"Our waitress was rude and pushy and the food was absolutely terrible! I will definitely not be back. Watery salsa and overcooked chips to start the meal. We decided to get the table side guacamole and neither of us were impressed. My meal was mostly rice and beans and the chicken inside the burrito was not good. I have almost nothing positive to say about this place besides their decor. Not sure why they're getting 3+ stars because honestly chipotle would've been better and worth the money."}
{"text":"I'm trying to think of anything I dislike about this place and I cant.  The guacamole the woman with the cart makes is great, the queso dip is great, all the food I've had is great.  My personal favorite is the \"Dos Amigos\" chicken and shrimp in a sour cream sauce oh my god and if you want to get the real deal ask for the handmade corn tortillas.  If I could eat here every day I probably would, and then I wouldnt fit through the door.

Also, I came here on my birthday and they brought me ice cream and sang me happy birthday while banging on drums.  Way better than red lobster."}
{"text":"Went down to the Carolina Rebellion last weekend, upon checking out of the Marriot Courtyard near by I hit up Yelp and this place popped up about a mile away.
Fantastic service throughout, top notch. Lunch specials were cheaper than what you can pay for some fast food spots. Atmosphere was festive and the margaritas were off the chain. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for all around, great Mexican food and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many time and this was the first time we have ever received poor service. Normally we come during lunch when it is super busy and receive very good service. Not sure what happened tonight but service was just as slow as the business. I left super unhappy and upset. 
When we got there the hostess seat us in the bar area. Table was really small since there was 3 of us and a newborn. It took about 10 mins before someone even came to take our drink order and food order. It also took forever for our food to come out. Had to wait also for our drinks to be refilled. Asked twice for more salsa since they only gave 1 small bowl for 3 ppl to share and that didn't come till after our food hit the table. Which then it wasn't needed. Our whole dinning experience took an 1hr and 45mins. At the end of our meal we got tired of waiting for our missing server to give us the check so we had to go up front to the rude hostess to pay. 
Your servers and hostess need to be train on customer service. The food was good but service was horrible. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"I really hate giving a 2 star but in order to give a three star, I have to least want to go back and I just can't say that I want to.

The service was on point - our server definitely stayed on top of providing us with excellent service. So my 2 star is in no reflection of that. 

Chips and salsa were banging. The rest of our food was just mediocre. I can't even remember what we ordered now - that is how much it left an impression on me. My son ordered a burger and while it was pretty big - it tasted like they ran it over several times. It was just so tough and dry.

They give you complimentary dessert which is nice but it is just some fried tortillas with cinnamon and sugar."}
{"text":"I have had to revise my previous 5 star rating for Azteca because of the LACK OF
SERVICE.   The past couple of times we've been here for lunch, I've noticed the
server barely comes back to see if you need a drink refill or anything else.  Today
after he brought our food, he never came back again (and yes I wanted more tea!)
until lhe saw the plates stacked at the end of the table and he asked us if we wanted to order anything else. The .50 tip I left reflected the level of service.

Also, as some other reviewers said, the salsa was very watery and the pork was
fatty. Not the Azteca of a couple of years ago.  I'll go back because it's close to work
and the taste of the food is good, but the service is lousy."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times when I'm in town and the food is just wonderful. Only causes I have for complaint would be the horrible mariachi band that roams from table to table, interrupting both conversations and meals AND the last few times there's always some type of panhandler outside by the door or in the parking lot. The restaurant is right in front of a ratty Days Inn and not in the best part of town, which likely explains this. Personally, I wouldn't go there in the evening by myself, but two or more in a group offers a bit more protection. At any rate, the great food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks at Azteca this weekend with a friend of mine. The restaurant itself is quite large and had a festive aura. Upon arriving, I sat at the bar (as I waited for my friend) and had a top shelf margarita. The margarita itself was strong. As a bartender, I tend to like mine a bit more subtle w the alcohol, but I'm a bit crazy like that. The bartender was affable and hard at work. He ran the bar nicely.

When my friend arrived we grabbed a table. No reservations on weekends keep in mind. Our server was quiet and a bit hurried. I understand that because it was a Saturday night. When we did order (burritos and a chicken dish in a cream sauce) our food came quickly. The chips that came with salsa were bland and too thick to me. The entrees themselves were on plates larger than a small country. It was aesthetically funny to look at. Our meals were good. Not amazing but not bad. I will say the chorizo burrito was quite tasty though. 

The pricing was inexpensive. Like most Mexican places, you get a lot of food for the $$.

Would I return. Yes. For what is in the area, Azteca is a decent spot for a quick and filling Mexican dish."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. My family and I have always used this place for special occasions. It shows you how good a place is when it is slammed full on a Friday night in Charlotte. Both locations can get full, so that is a sign that they are doing something right!"}
{"text":"OK Mex.

Went here on a early Sat evening for dinner. We sat outside on the patio which was nice.

I had the two Amigos with grilled shrimp and chicken in a sauce of sour cream and
melted monterray jack cheese.

It comes with refrios and lettuce with a choice of flour or corn tortillas.
The taste was somewhat bland.

Their salsa was very heavy on onions which I didn't care for."}
{"text":"This is about as authentic as you can get north of the border.
Most all their staff is Latino.

They will mix up fresh quacomole at your table side, Armando barely spoke english.

They have excellent lunch specials for less than $5.
Grande portions and sabroso mex!"}
{"text":"I just flew in and must say I was very pleased.  I checked yelp for a Mexican place and while this was only 3.5 stars it was close by so I took a chance.  It was clean. Staff was nice. Not too expensive and food was pretty good. They even bring u a little desert chip. Which is a nice touch. 
Orders the chicken fajitas. Not the best in the world but really good."}
