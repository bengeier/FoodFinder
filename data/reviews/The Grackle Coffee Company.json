{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've ever had.
Made to order so it's not a quick experience.
I will occasionally drive from Newmarket just to have a cup of bold dark roast.
Heaven."}
{"text":"A great little coffee shop that is on one of the main cycling routes in southern Ontario. Coffee is from Dark City roasters and is great. Their food is vegetarian and vegan, and we had their butternut squash soup. It was superb, and a great way to refill our fluids back up after the bike trip from Toronto. Seating is limited, during the summer, most cyclists eat and drink outside if they are in a big group, we were just four people. They only accept cash payment, no credit or debit machine. There's a CIBC ATM up the street. Looking forward to visiting again the next time I cycle in the area."}
{"text":"Huzzahhh! I had to drive quite a distance to find it but at long long last I have found the hip indie coffee shop of my GTA dreams - and it's in Schomberg? 

The Grackle Coffee Company is located on Main street in the historical village of Schomberg (north-west of Aurora). If you're not careful you could walk right past this place as the tiny re-purposed house has only a tiny sign to let you know it exists.

Entering, I was greeted by a crowd of locals, a room full of oscillating ceiling fans, and an artistic decor that would make an Toronto Hipster weep with joy. Independent art for sale adorns the walls, as well as freshly baked goods, preserves, hand made scarves, a giant set of antlers AND a friendly shop dog making sure everyone is enjoying their day (adorable)!

I didn't get a chance to dine on their dessert and sandwich menu (diet) but I did grab a cappuccino on the recommendation of the tattooed barrista (told you this place was cool). The cappuccino was amazing! The beans were a unique custom, freshly roasted/ground blend, and the latte/foam art on the top was art all by itself. $3.15 for the Cappuccino (taxes in).

Everyone here is incredibly friendly and I certainly recommend you come here if you're looking for great service, good food and a little peace and tranquility in the middle of your day. 

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"This is one of those local gems full of bicyclists stopping by for lunch or breakfast. I adore all the delish gluten free and veggie options, no meat here. The cafe is just so cozy and cool it's worth being here. I would probably be here everyday if I lived in the area #cafelife. I ordered a sandwich with veggies, cheese and a nice spicy mustard. Haven't tried their sweets but they look so good!!!! 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Schomberg and stopped by this place while walking along Main Street. Its seriously the cutest- small, charming and offers a good variety of Organic options AND goat milk which is rare to find. I found the prices to reflect Toronto which is interesting because Im sure rent is significantly lower here but what the hell do I know. 2 wraps and 2 medium coffees cost $35- right!? Lots of local traffic and cash only!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing and amazing! 

This place is so cool and cozy. We happened to pass by on our way home from visiting a friend who recently moved to Tottenham. They have the usual coffee, tea, cookies, etc. that you would normally find on a hippie 3rd wave coffee shop in the city. But what makes this great is that it's situated in a nice little village of Schomberg just off the Highway 9. The inside of the shop is littered with novelty items that one can find in an antic/boutique stores. Best of all, the staff were blasting a Ukrainian-violinist punk-style music when we were there. How can you top that? 

Hoping to pass by again to not only visit this shop but have a stroll around this village in the summertime. 

Definitely 8-thumbs up from our family of four!"}
{"text":"I agree with my fellow poster - cool funky little indie shop with organic free trade delicacies, local goodies, wares,  artesians, and is happy to display them on the walls or wherever they will fit.

Ya, it's best kept secret alright - tucked away on Schomberg's main drag - not visible from HWY 27.

.. and comes with a side order of \"across the pond\" UK English Wit ;)   ... you'll see... heh heh

(there's a scottish store a few doors down if you're hankering for a home made steak n kidney pie)

You're gonna have to GPS this one folks...

also be sure to stop by in the summer too for organic icecream with real cream... and visit the local farmer's market every other weekend just around the corner."}
{"text":"3.5 Star (Rounded up to 4 as it might be the only Indie Coffeeshop in the area)

The Grackle Coffee with a small town charm. 

Nice outdoor area in the front perfect for a nice sunny day. 

They uses coffee from Dark City Coffee Co in Toronto. http://www.darkcitycoffee.com/ My macchiato was nice and balance. For Cappuccino, I do suggest getting a double shot of espresso, but the milk was frothed perfectly. 

A lot of baked good that looks yummy in the display case.

Wifi is available. Especially great if you are not on Bell network as Schomberg is a dead zone for Rogers...."}
