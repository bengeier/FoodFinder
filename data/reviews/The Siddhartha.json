{"text":"Great food, lots of vegan options, friendly server, nice atmosphere, inexpensive.
It seems like it has recently been opened.
I'm surprised I did not find this online when searching for a good Indian buffet in Toronto with vegan options."}
{"text":"I noticed that some of these reviews are from when the restaurant served both meat and veg. It's reopened and is veg only (mostly vegan, and the waiter was very friendly and helpful in showing us which items were not vegan). 

We recently went for the buffet. I thought there were a lot of choices, good flavours, and that it was a pretty good value. The naan was absolutely delicious. 

It only gets three stars because it was so so salty. I'd go back every once in awhile when craving that type of food, but some of the dishes were so salty that I could feel the muscles in my face twitching a couple times."}
{"text":"It is a true shame, we had high hopes for Indian food in the \"Indian Bazar\". The buffet had a reasonable selection but it was all cold, the lamb was tough and when we asked for an ala carte menu the wait staff ignored us. We ill not be going back.

{"text":"The best Indian buffet I know in Toronto.

The price is very affordable: $12 for lunch and $13 for dinner. For this price you have unlimited buffet dishes and one naan.

They have a great selection of curries (6 as of yesterday). Their cooked eggplant and potatoes were very delicious, the best spiced eggplant I have ever eaten. I also really recommend their chana masala, again it is the best chickpea curry I have ever had. Though the naan was so-so.

Suitable for both vegetarians and vegans.

Good place to come alone. The atmosphere is more like a dining hall than a restaurant, very relaxed.

The staff is very courteous and polite, calling you \"sir\" every time they address you.

The only bad thing I can say about this kind of restaurant that in the end I ended up eating too much."}
{"text":"Great  vegetarian selection. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Food was hot and very satisfying. Both times that we have eaten here were very enjoyable. Will definitely return again. The buffet had a good selection that was replenished constantly."}
{"text":"When I went to Siddhartha's, I had the buffet lunch and it was very good. Lots of choices. The food seemed fresh. The best part was the service. The waiter brought us fresh naan to our table, which tasted great. He visited our table at the right times to refill our drinks, and was very kind. He also gave us chai tea on the house (free!). I would recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully decorated and comfortable as well as clean, which is what made us decide to have a afternoon brunch there, you know the saying don't judge a book by it's covet, the food was very poorly prepared and it seemed like it was reused from previous day. Just about every dish was unedible, from the butter chicken (which was SWEET I think the chef put sugar instead of salt in it.) to the spinach and tandoori chicken all tasted 2 days old. I would never eat here again:-( IT Was Terrible!"}
{"text":"Très bon buffet indien, qualité de mets et des saveurs indiennes comme on les aime. Le personnel est agréable, sympathique et sans prétention."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Excellent meat and veggie options. Quiet, polite servers with no effort to get you to purchase drinks though it would be nice if they asked on occasion. I wish they would have a soup available with their buffet. That would make it absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Service was slow but we were not ignored. Nice buffet and the Naan special was fantastic. Much better setting than most other places in the area. Not necessarily the best food however."}
{"text":"It seems almost pointless to review the specifics of the buffet, because, based on previous reviews, the choices change.

Leave it at this...nothing was outstanding, either way.  No fantastic dishes...no total duds.  The food was tasty and well prepared.  No dal, though, and it's one of my favourites.  The experience was MUCH better than my last meal at Mahar.

It is a clean and comfortable place, with good service.  My dining partner insisted that I mention that our waiter almost wore a trough in the floor by circling the restaurant constantly...whether anyone needed anything or not.  It was like he was doing laps, waiting for a customer to flag him down.

Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I've only ever tried the buffet, and it's not something I would try again. A clean restaurant with great service cannot make up for mediocre food."}
{"text":"That's a shame, Ryan F.! I really enjoyed the buffet! I thought they had a great vegetarian selection. It contained all the dishes I would've ordered anyway - jalfrezi, saag paneer, paneer makhni (a tomato-based paneer),  delicious pakora, an okra/eggplant dish, chick peas curry, aloo gobi and lots of pickled-like appetizers and salads. They also had these cottage cheese ball desserts (I was too full) and ice cream for any gluttons that could make it that far (Ok, guilty!).
All the dishes had a distinct flavour. I've tried a few places along the gerrard strip and this is near the top!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Siddhartha.

Our group of 5 decided to have the buffet dinner ($14.95pp). There were several empty tables when we arrived. 

The selection of items consisted of the traditional items: tandoori chicken, butter chicken, paneer tikka, channa peshawri, aloo ghobi, etc...We found the food to be fresh and flavourful.  Our server brought out a a fresh basket of garlic naan for our table which was crispy and warm. Overall, I thought the food was fine and exactly what I expected.

Atmosphere is cozy and inviting; you could sit for a few hours, have a drink and nibble away. Don't do what we did - gorging too fast will only result in a sore stomach!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, it took awhile for them to actually notice that I need water in my table and had to asked them. 

For the food, the butter chicken is the best while the vegetable (fried rice) tasted weird and somewhat hard. The others like the naan bread was too soft and didn't really compliment the curry so much as what I tasted in other restaurants.

For a $15 (plus tax) buffet, it's somewhat a rip off considering there are a ton of other buffets around this place."}
{"text":"The buffet offers the \"staple\" Indian dishes you'd come to expect from an Indian restaurant. The menu has a wide selection of more adventurous dishes. At times, the food is excellent, other times it is lacking. The interior is nicely decorated and the service is among the best I've had in a restaurant, let alone one in Little India. The vegetarian Siddhartha, owned by the same people just down the street, is better; but this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"In a great vegetarian restaurant, omnivore customers are happy without the meat. I enjoy the menu, especially the buffet. Quiet and comfortable, looks on to the street. Very clean"}
{"text":"This is one of the many Indian buffet places in the neighbourhood.  In my experience, Sidhartha is a great spot.  Their buffet has the essentials of any Indian buffet.  Things like butter chicken, tandoori chicken, etc.

However, my opinion of most places in this area is that they are all very similar.  They all offer the same food options, and most of them are for around the same price.  Sidhartha is a bit more expensive than others, but the staff is very professional.  A bit androidesque at times, but very on their game."}
{"text":"There are far better options in Little India than Siddhartha. I'm always surprised when I see several people occupying the tables within, however it usually serves as a sad introduction to those not familiar with Indian food in the least. 

Usually, once people try the other options available within Little India and elsewhere in the city, rarely do they ever return. 

The food looks just fine, when squinting 5 feet away, but then as you approach you note that many dishes are ridden with food colouring, and floating in water. Once you try your first bite, you realize that everything is sugary, even the chicken. 

I would rather take my friends to Haandi or Mahar down the street. They won't hate you for it afterwards."}
{"text":"sidhartha is indeed fine.  the finesse starts with their decor which is all in dark moody reds and browns...the lights are a bit dimmed down, theres some decorations here and there and poof - romance.

didnt help that i went with my brother.

well, that didnt stop us from getting real intimate...with the food.  while they do offer a full menu from which to choose, its pretty hard to resist a steaming buffet that is regularly replenished with creamy rich delights of india or at least gerrard street east.

im not schooled enough in indian food to be able to pick out a dish thats more original than others, but they do have what you might expect and desire like butter chicken, saag, chicken, lamb dishes, daal, a couple different kinds of rice, and a whole other buffet table just for deserts.

the best things about buffets of course is the choice, and thats what youre paying for, because essentially you are paying for one plate of food.  at least thats me - actually its more like this:  one plate of heaping awesome food that, with a kingfisher beer or two, has done its job of satiation.  then my eyes begin to grow molars and fangs and rappel their way down to the buffet table for another plate of food that they cant possibly consume...BECAUSE THEYRE EYES.  

so then my stupid mouth takes over until my belly starts punching itself from the inside and telling my brain to call me idiot over and over again.

now in as much as this is a testament to the nature of buffets, it is, of course, a testament to sidharthas fine indian cuisine."}
{"text":"One of the nice things about living in Toronto is there's such a critical mass of most cultures that restaurant owners don't have to dumb it down for whitey. If whitey doesn't like kimchi or green curry or natto, well, whitey can take a flying fuck at the moon and go eat at Swiss Chalet. 

Slinky Woman and I headed out to Little India looking for a buffet. It was Thanksgiving Monday and Little India was quite dead. After passing by a couple empty places we happened upon Siddartha with some diners and decided to follow the wisdom of the crowds. But as Roma notes, the wisdom of the crowds fails. 

The buffet was nicely varied but everything else seemed a let down. The naan was flavorless. The butter chicken tasted like hunks of chicken in ketchup. The pakoras were mushy and without any zip. I expected something full of zing and challenge in the heart of Little India. What I got was something that seemed dumbed down.  About the only nice thing at the buffet was ice cream and respectable Gulab Jamuns."}
{"text":"Everybody loves this place because of the patio - which is nice, I agree, and sorely needed in this hood.

However, the service is generally mediocre and, occasionally, indifferent.  

But what kills me is the lack of fresh naan.  they refuse to serve it to you at the table - as every other Indian resto I've ever been too (dozens and dozens of them, in a variety of countries) does.  

this costs the resto next to nothing to make, it's a service for customers to make it fresh and absolutely a given at any authentic Indian restaurant.  

People come in because it's the nicest looking spot on the strip (it is quite attractive) and I fear they think they can mail the service in."}
{"text":"So gross.  I don't often have negative things to say about restaurants in Toronto but this place is so \"watered down\" to north american taste it is gross.  The aloo gobi was drowning in butter with hardly any flavour, as was the lamb curry.  Even the mixed grilled tikka plate was average.  There was no spice to it, the onions were burnt to the bottom instead of caramelized and it was small.  I would not recommend this place or return. Lastly the chutney was sugary and the consistency dense jello."}
{"text":"I attended this establishment due to generally remembering good reviews read somewhere and was disappointed. 
This place would do well and be marveled at in white suburbia but in little India, it was bland at best.
I went with my parents and my nephew and dined on the buffet. All of the curries I found greasy and underspiced. The Tandoori chicken was ok but a little dry and the naan was doughy. Over all the price was high, especially for little India. 

Maybe I am just spoiled by having access to the rest of little India for better food (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bar-be-que-hut-toronto#hrid:wm4rvociMZ8WSXhzkcMRzA) in general I was not impressed. Though this place may go over quite well in Whitby or Oshawa."}
{"text":"I still have nightmares of this place!! If your indian and looking for an Indian curry then AVOID this place at all costs.

The service was normal, the drinks were fine, the atmosphere was good.... But the food was awful! I asked for a hot, spicy curry and they gave me a pizza base sauce with meat chucks and the worst part was it had oregano in it.. Since when does an Indian restaurant put Italian herbs in any Indian curry. 

I complained immediately but the waiter and manager stated that they are authentic and oregano goes in curry. What a disgrace  to Toronto's little India!"}
{"text":"Service was worst.. Food was of low quality.
The Manager has no courtesy to talk to people.

Worst indian food.. They don't know how to treat and respect the people.

Rice was not cooked well, palak curry was not up to mark.

Suggestion - please go and try some other restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian lunch buffet. We would eat here again. They have another location that offers meat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place, I walk by almost daily and the pictures of the buffet in the window looked wonderful, Lunch buffet is now only available on weekends so we went Sunday at noon. Although they open at 11:30 NOTHING was set up and they didn't even know we were there. Not to be detoured, we went over to the Flying Pony to have a coffee and give them time to set up. Half an hour later, the buffet was half full at this point we should have walked, but hubby knew I had been wanting to try so we decided to stay. Slowly the additional dishes were brought out but we found most of them watery and lacking substance. There were several dishes labelled Paneer but it was hard to find any Paneer in them. When I pointed this out they did bring out a bowl and add more cubes. Come on now, we were the first customers of the day it is not like someone before us picked the dishes clean (unless of course, they were recycled from the previous nights buffet). 

The food was over seasoned and I know this because I eat Indian cuisine about once a week. Fresh naan was not on the bar, it was made to order and brought to the table, with a choice of regular or garlic, It was not brought until we were well into our second plate of food and it was one piece quartered. There were two of us, they gave a single diner near us the same exact basket. They offered more when the basket was empty, but who has all afternoon? It was close to 1pm before they brought out the chopped lettuce for the salad bar, well over an hour after they opened. I see all these wonderful reviews about the eggplant, that must have been in the one remaining empty spot on the buffet when we left, as there was none. Although I am not vegetarian/vegan my daughter is and I am quite familiar with eating this way. This was the gassiest experience I have ever from a vegetarian restaurant.

The price is very affordable and the staff friendly but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been going to Siddhartha for many years, since the owner of the current Siddhartha had been a server at the original Siddhartha (a little further west on the south side of the street from the current location).

The first thing that I noticed is that the owner picked up on some very strong decor sense from his time as a server at Dhaba and implemented a beautiful and serene environment at Siddhartha.

Secondly, he also instituted some strong customer service skills in his staff, that he himself exhibited as a server. As someone who basically grew up in Little India on Gerrard Street, I can tell you that customer service has been non-existent up until the original Siddhartha opened its doors about 20 years ago. The team at the current location have continued this tradition.

The third big win for me, is the chef. He has been consistent since he opened. The food is very Panjabi in nature, and hence, a little on the oily side.

However, the food is very flavourful. Sometimes, I can just eat the delicious rice and dhal from the buffet, and I am quite satisfied.

The pakoras are fresh and tasty, always, and the chutneys (tamarind and chili) are delicious!

As a vegetarian, I usually stick with Palak Panner, Aloo Ghobi and Dhal (as those are my favourites), however, I have tried the veggie korma and eggplant, and they are quite delicious, also!

I have been to other buffets on Gerrard Street, and I keep going back to Siddhartha. Why? Because it's the best buffet on Gerrard Street.

I noticed that someone wrote below that Italian spices don't belong in Indian cooking. Let's get something straight, some of the herbs that are predominant in Italian cooking, originally come from India, Iran and other Asian countries (i.e. basil). Do your homework before you make statements that detract from the integrity of the chef.

I also read something about pizza sauce ... perhaps this reviewer needs to do some research.

Chicken Tikka Masala, for example, originates from Scotland, not India, and was created to appease the UK palate. It's basically Tandoori Chicken with tomato soup. The result is not very Indian, but a dish that has become the number one fast food in the UK. 

Pizza sauce? Close enough."}
{"text":"Tried the vegetarian buffet at dinner.  The food was generally fine but not exceptional.

The dishes I enjoyed the most were the eggplant and cauliflower.  The mint chutney was awesome -- very fresh & flavourful!

I was not especially impressed with the pakora, samosa, daal, or other dishes.
Naan was so-so.

Service was fine.

{"text":"As a vegetarian, my experience at \"all you can eat\" buffets is usually more like \"I should have just ordered an entree for half the price\"...but not here!  I'm sure sitting & ordering their entrees is just as good - but the main focus here for me is the All-You-Can-Eat Vegetarian Indian Buffet.  Sign me up!

Don't make a rookie mistake & not save room for dessert - it's delicious as well."}
{"text":"What a deal! At under $15/person for the all-you-can-eat buffet this is a definite stop while touring the shops along Gerrard Street East. 

Buffet selection is excellent. While I generally avoid the salad portion of the buffet (ice burg lettuce does not fit my idea of an Indian Buffet),  there are still over 20 traditional items to choose from."}
{"text":"1.The buffet is over priced considering the cheaper alternatives across the street.

2. I never been to a buffet that actually ran out of food for prolonged periods. I was there for an hour and could not get any Naan at all. 

3. There was a poor selection of food when compared to a regular indian buffet."}
