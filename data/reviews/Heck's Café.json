{"text":"We had a wonderful first experience. We were unsure of a final selection so management actually brought out a portion of the amazing eggplant dish for us to try in addition to our main courses. The service was fantastic, management was generous and kind. We will be going back frequently!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Such good coffee and this my favorite place for brunch too."}
{"text":"Fabulous! We were delighted to stop by this restaurant by chance and be overwhelmed with the healthy, high quality, allergy friendly options! If you have food sensitivities - this is the restaurant to visit! The waiter was excellent and her desire to accommodate our needs was exceptional!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to read or write reviews about restaurants before I go since I like to form my own opinion.  We went to hecks for lunch today to try something new close to home and we were very happy. My boyfriend got the Avon burger and I got the chicken tacos. Outstanding! The service from Angela at the bar was great and all the information she gave us was very clear. From the hostesses to the food runner, everyone was very nice and welcoming.  The salted caramel bread pudding...oh my gosh I'm going to have dreams about it! I hope this location survives, suburban people aren't the easiest to please (according to this comments)!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious brunch!  Loved the variety and the fact that it wasn't the traditional brunch food so everyone was happy."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is always packed.  The food is horrible and the place is filthy, dining room was full of flies and fruit flies.  Restrooms were filthy mentioned this to the manager who could care less told me they were getting a new pest company in.  Service is friendly but slow and unprofessional.  Food is over priced and not worth the chance of getting sick form filty conditions."}
{"text":"I just left Heck's and have held off in the past posting reviews. The burgers are good and it's why I come back. I'm done though, the service is consistently bad, always inattentive, and I feel like I'm bothering them. I was leaving, walked past the two girls at the host station who were talking to each other. Didn't acknowledge us leaving which is a basic of customer service. I walked back in and told them thanks and to enjoy their night. I don't even know if they got the point...  Also, why is it when they are slow it takes forever to get anything? This includes water... Any good organization, whether it's a large company, or Hecks, needs a good leader. They are glaringly lacking in this department."}
{"text":"The hostess and waitress were super friendly and helpful. We had 4 adults and 4 kids. 3 adults ordered the rocky river burger and I ordered the market burger. We all ordered our burgers medium, but they all came out well done and dry. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, decent service... but it's so loud. The restaurant is basically a big box of cement and glass with nothing to absorb sound. I would avoid Heck's during busy times (unless the patio is open). Their baked brie was my favorite, but they recently took it off the menu :( their brunch options are pretty good, though. The baklava French toast is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Tried this new Avon location for lunch today.  The  place has a stark, minimalist, vibe resulting in a noisy hubbub .  There are no soft, sound-deadening surfaces anywhere. Windows on almost every side. The vaulted ceiling contributes to the unpleasant loud acoustics.   As to the food:  I had the Rocky River burger.  It arrived medium rare as I requested. Sizable and tasty, albeit a little pricey.  I recommend it, if cost is not a big issue for you.  My guest had chicken tacos (per a suggestion from our excellent waitress) and announced they were \"great\".    So, 4-stars for the food...3-stars for ambience."}
{"text":"Meh. It wasn't anything special or memorable. Our waitress was nice and the food was ok."}
{"text":"I had heard multiple times from a coworker how good Heck's Cafe was. I happen to find myself in Avon during the dinner hour and decided to see for myself.  I know a burger is what I should have ordered but I was looking for something a bit lighter. So why not an orange & beet salad? Unfortunately I had about 4 orange slices and the candied walnut clusters had to be broken into smaller pieces. The dressing and beets were good but for an entree salad I expected a little more.  Hope to come back and try a burger some day."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Heck's in Ohio City several times and enjoyed my meals. Went for brunch on a Sunday to the Avon location and ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict. My eggs were closer to hard boiled than poached and needed to be sent back. Adding insult to injury, there was only a sliver of salmon. Also ordered the Rocky River burger which was rather dry. The server, while polite, never returned during our meal to offer drink refills (coffee, Bellini and/or Bloody Mary). This could have been simply growing pains being a relatively new restaurant, but it was a disappointment to say the least."}
{"text":"I love this place but how do you charge $8.50 for a regular Mule?  Two drinks for $17?  WTF"}
{"text":"Food was average, service below average.   We had Ahi nachos, Burgers, ribeye and Lobster Mac and cheese- all just average.   Service- bad. They forgot one person's order and were barely apologetic. Some of us were done with our meal by the time they got it. They never offered to take off the menu. Chicken was forgotten on another's salad."}
{"text":"Just had brunch and was disappointed.  We normally come for dinner and really enjoy their food but today we had crab Benedict and vegetable hash.  The side of potatoes were tasteless as they had been sitting for awhile.  We left still hungry."}
{"text":"Great food and service - worth the price. There are some cheap reviewers on here. The burger was delicious, and the draft beer list was fairly extensive. There was a good mix of local and national craft beers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and haven't been disappointed yet. I've had pasta, salads, and of course the burgers which their original Ohio City location is known for. No service complaints either. I appreciate that there is a decent  beer and wine selection without high menu prices.   Good food, affordable, and classy casual atmosphere. A great addition to Avon."}
{"text":"Location and facility and service : good. Food : not impressed at all... Expensive for the quality. I won't go back"}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was very hesitant to try the new Hecks Cafe in Avon. But we were pleasantly surprised with good food, excellent service and the kitchen did a very good job in preparing our delicious meal in a timely way. But, the noise issue is still a big problem.   That is the only thing that would keep me from coming back. Our server said the owner intends to fix that.  Hope so.  I don't understand why the high noise level is so popular with restaurant designers.  Maybe they are all deaf.  I understand it discourages campers, but it makes the dining experience very uncomfortable for everyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite place to eat!!!  Fantastic staff with amazing veggie burger.   Our server Danielle was extremely accommodating and her recommendations were spot on.  Go there and you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: lighting is similar to operating room lighting, harsh, overhead, daylight led bulbs.  Service: our server didn't have much to say, we had to ask about the specials, soup, etc.   Food:  the bottom bun on the med rare burger was so soggy it fell apart as I picked it up.  Sent it back, server was unapologetic.  A forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Fast service, reasonable prices, & a great atmosphere. I had the Buffalo chicken wrap and my son had the grilled chicken tenders. We also ordered the pretzel bread pudding which was interesting; I personally wouldn't get that again but it was still good."}
{"text":"I have to say I am bummed by my most recent experience. My boyfriend and I stopped in at 9pm on a Friday night and there were only a handful of people there. With that being said it took awhile for our waitress to even come over to our table (later we realized our waitress was also the bartender). This became a problem later into the meal when a group came in and sat at the bar. I will let you imagine how the service went from there... The other downfall of the night was the rude waitress serving the table next to us. There was a discrepancy with an order and the waitress was visibly rolling her eyes and talking about the table with other servers. If you are going to do that make sure other customers cannot see you! I was appalled by her behavior because if we could see her I am sure the table with the discrepancy could see her as well!   The terrible thing about writing this is that I came for brunch on the patio over the summer and had a great experience. So I don't know what happened to the service or if we just happened to pick a really bad night to come.  Besides the negative service the only great thing was that the food is still as good as I remember and my boyfriend stated that his burger was on point."}
{"text":"I've been meeting up with my best friend for lunch here since Heck's opened the Avon location. The bartenders never disappoint. Today we were greeted by Kyle! What an exceptional addition to our experience. We learned he is s Certified Bartender! We mentioned a fancy gin cocktail, and he out did himself, over the top! He explained our dietary restrictions to the kitchen, and our meals were presented as asked! Great, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was excited to find  a vegan entree until we all finally received our meals. Mine was cool and the plate was hot (warmer lights?) Disappointing bI didn't ask for a remake since everyone was eating. The mgr came over and offered though, after hearing from the server that I was a little disappointed. She insisted, kindly, to let her make it right. My meal came back relatively quickly and was new and improved. Everyone seemed satisfied with their meals but no one mentioned outstanding quality. Nice to have a place not overcrowded on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Wa great food really fresh would come again! They didn't bring the appetizer out first so they took it off the bill without giving us a hassle. Professional"}
{"text":"I love this place! We have been here a few times and each time tried something different. The Avon burger is my favorite. We always share the pirogies as a starter.  They have a great wine selection. Their specialty drink menu is pretty good too.   The patio is awesome in warm weather. A great spot for a girls night or a date night. It doesn't hurt that there is a Mitchell's in walking distance"}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate burgers that appear to rely on the strength of their toppings to make up for the shortcomings in the flavoring of the meat. Unremarkable fries that add little to the experience. Decor is space but fairly nice."}
{"text":"After noting The Winking Lizard Avon had a half hour wait on a Monday evening, we decided to try Heck's.  I have personally been looking forward to trying Heck's.  It's been awhile since I dined in their Ohio City location.  Unfortunately after experiencing the food here, I think I'll be crossing Heck's off my list.  First off, there was ample seating available (both indoors and on the patio).  A little surprising to me since the Winking Lizard had a wait and Bar 140 looked like they were hopping.  After glancing over the menu I felt that Heck's wanted to diiferentiate itself by trying to be a bit more upscale - emphasizing wine, changing up the dishes a bit, etc.  Interesting to me, they do not publish their draft beers on the menu.  Instead you have to rely on the waitress reciting them.  The list was slightly above average.  Tough approach to me - I really don't want to play a memory game.  I would prefer a list in front of me.  My wife and I split a Calamari appetizer ($11).  It was served with a garlic aioli and fried capers (see how they are trying to differentiate themselves by using capers and aioli).  I thought it was good.  Not too much on taste (note: this will be a key point below) but the calamari was cooked well and was quite tender and hot.  Worth $11 - ahh, I would say it was priced a couple of bucks too high.  For entrees, we both went with what Heck's is noted for - burgers.  I had the special which was a Creole Burger - burger topped with andouille, creole sauce and the standards - l/t/o.  My wife chose the Ohio City - which was topped with mushrooms and \"herbs from the nations\".  This was explained to us by the waitress as a pesto of sorts.  Both burgers were cooked to our ordering - medium.  The major problem - and it was major in our eyes - the burgers were tasteless.  I even tasted the andouille sausage separately and it had virtually no kick and no taste.  The creole sauce had absolutely no taste whatsoever.  My wife completely agreed; the same with her burger.  She had me taste a bite and I agreed - that \"Herbs from all the nations\" had so much promise but it had no taste.  Both burgers came with fries.  They were fresh cut.  Overall, they were good.  Were the burgers worth the price of admission - $13 and $11.  Absolutely not considering how tasteless they were.  They would have been worth it if they had taste as indicated on their descriptions.  After dinner, we told the waitress our thoughts.  She took it all in and was excellent about it.  She came back indicating the kitchen wanted us to have a dessert on them - we passed.  Nice gesture though.  My back was to the restaurant so I'm not sure if a manager was on duty or not ... I'm guessing not.  Overall, service was excellent.  I really hope Heck's listen to this criticism.  There is so much competition out there for burgers so your product needs to stand out - especially with B Spot, Winking Lizard and Bar 140 in close proximity.  If your charging in the low teens your product needs to bring it's \"A\" game to the consumer.  Heck's burgers definitely did not!  I gave them a chance.  Unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the food as I have only so far ordered delivery via Uber Eats.  My food arrived warm and it was a large portion. I got the French onion soup which is absolutely delicious. I'm a huge fan of French onion soup and this may be one of the best I've ever had. It is sooo flavorful and well balanced. It's the perfect ratio of soup to cheese to bread. YUM.  I also opted to get the orange and beet salad. It was amazing. The two dressings - a balsamic reduction and an apricot vinaigrette - were so sweet and tangy. It went perfectly with the goat cheese and candied walnuts! I highly recommend this salad for lunch!  The only reason I rate this 4 starts is that  I believe the price point is a little high. My soup was $7 and the salad was $12. It's not an outrageous price but just above what I'd expect to pay! The food was delicious though so definitely worth it to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Went in for brunch, they have a nice brunch menu ordered the crab cakes Benedict, flavor was nice not the best I've had but service was good considering it was Sunday and pretty full of people. For the price I would have rather gone to Brio the brunch is better at Brio at Crocker."}
{"text":"Been there several times now, the food is always delicious. The onion soup is one of the best in the area. Their appetizers are unique and always delicious. The service is friendly. Definitely would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went into check the new restaurant in Avon on a very hot September day.  The place wasn't busy so we thought it would be a quick dinner.  Well, for one, there were about 10 tables occupied and over abundance of wait staff.  Friendly host sat us down then 0, zilch, nada!  We looked over the menu and waited and waited.  10 minutes went by and so did a bunch of wait staff.  A table came in after us and a waitress went over to them quickly.  Meanwhile, we just sat there waiting for anyone to come over to greet us even.  15, 16 minutes and wait staff were behind a wait station standing and talking.  Wait staff peered around the corner but no one came over.  17 minutes and we left.  We eat out several times a week.  Our regular restaurants the staff comes and greets us immediately.    There is no excuse for this horrible service. Customers come before employee fraternization!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry to say never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hot fire burger and fries were good.  Definitely had some kick.  Waiter was awesome too.  A little pricey for what it is though."}
{"text":"The place was amazing.  Amanda was our server she was awesome, very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  The food was great the drinks were great can't say much more more, this place is the whole package."}
{"text":"new place. atmosphere kind of trendy. staff friendly, food excellent! would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio for the Burger Battle selection at Heck's. We started with the Buffalo Cauliflower. It was amazing. The cauliflower was perfectly cooked. Just done. Held together perfectly. The Burger Battle selection was cooked medium rare like my husband requested. I had the short ribs entree with parsnip purée. It was so tender and the parsnip purée was unreal. Didn't know if I would like it. Oh I did! So creamy. For dessert we had the Salted Caramel Pretzel Bread Pudding. One of the best desserts we have ever had. Bar none. We will be stopping by for more of that in the near future. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday brunch on a Saturday and was told that they only offered it on Sunday even though the website didn't mention that. Our server got the manager and they said they would fix the website and get the birthday girl her brunch hash. The rest of us enjoyed our tasty lunch items. Overall it ended being a pleasant experience with great service on a well sized patio."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I have tried the Cajun burger both times and I love the brioche bun. I went with a group of friends this time so I got to see a bunch of other options. The au chèvre and Rocky River burger were the waitresses recommendation. A couple people tried the calamari and weren't as happy with it. It's not the typically fried kind you might expect and came with capers. The fries are fresh cut and great. One couple tried the garlic aioli mayo for dipping and liked that. Desserts looked great, but everyone was well satisfied with just their meals. They also do a split plate for the burger so one friend and his spouse shared a burger and got an appetizer as well.  Our server was excellent and attentive. I have had great service both times. Well appointed dining area. My only complaint is that the drinks are overpriced."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here while shopping on the west side because of the yelp reviews. Sits on the corner of a VERY busy shopping plaza/strip mall. The decor was nothing special but they were serving Bloody Mary's like hot cakes. I ordered one which I found to be mediocre. Weak & not spicy enough. I liked that they made them with Tito's but when I told the bartender I do not like Olives as a garnish I should have asked what she was going to use as a replacement. I really dislike, I mean DETEST banana peppers & that's what was floating on top when she served it to me. Luckily I fished them out quick enough for the taste of them to not linger behind. I ordered a burger that came with white cheddar, bacon, an egg & sour cream. It was cooked well when I ordered it medium well & lacked in flavor. I also had the fresh cut fries that were okay - not the best I have ever had but were cooked perfectly, a little soft & crunchy. The aioli made them taste much better. Unfortunately I found a hair on my plate & lost my appetite immediately. The bartender genuinely felt bad & took my meal off the tab. Accidents happen & I would never hold that against a restaurant. However, the lack of flavor & character are the reasons I would not return."}
{"text":"New place in Avon and stopped by during lunch.  Ordered the Rocky River burger and it was nicely prepared with fresh cut fries.    Pomegranate tea was $5 per bottle.  That was a surprise when the bill was delivered to the table.   Look forward to returning for dinner minus the bottled tea."}
{"text":"Good prices, good food, good service, plenty of parking, it's a little tricky to find the lot but once you do totally worth it."}
{"text":"We went there today. Burger was fairly decent. The bun was boring and flavorless. Fries were good. Onion rings great. Service was semi slow and the atmosphere wasn't great. It was an open warehouse like setting. Nothing cute or cozy. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Environment: big metal and glass box, high ceilings, very noisy, nondescript; bathrooms were not clean (this always makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen) Food: entrees are on the expensive side for this kind of an environment (average: $20); Burgers - which is what Heck's has been famous for are reasonably priced and good - appreciate that the beef is Ohio, grass-fed. Soggy fries. Salads: just ok (my romaine was a little less than crispy/fresh and it looked like the accompanying ingredients were simply tossed on the plate (no thought to presentation) Service: So-so  Overall impression: I prefer Heck's Ohio City location. Avon has a way to go before we venture back out there for food. Tremont, Ohio City, Gordon Square, Lakewood, even Rocky River -- all have much better offerings"}
{"text":"Needed a place for a business lunch and my wife recommend Hecks Cafe in Avon. Coming from the west on Detroit Road, I had difficulty finding it as there was a sign at the first strip. Pulled in and it was no where to be found. It turns out it was three strips east. I finally found it by asking a customer I saw walking out of Mitchell's Ice Cream which is in itself one of the best! Once I arrived at Hecks, the place was excellent from the greeting to the servers to the food. The burger and onion rings were tasty and cooked to perfection. Also the servers were diligent in keeping you drinks refreshed. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Vegan options.  Yummy milkshakes, too.  Cute simple ambiance and wonderful service.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had the seared tuna and my hot date had the lobster mac. Both were very good. I would give it five stars but they were out of miller lite and several other beers. Not cool."}
{"text":"This is a really nice cafe. It has a nice interior with a large patio as well. The food is pretty good, but the prices do not match. It's a bit too expensive for my liking. Their burgers range from $11-16 or so. They come with fresh cut fries, but I still think it's expensive for a cafe. I got an appetizer as my meal which was the Bruschetta Pierogis. They were great and cost $9. I'd recommend coming here for sure, but expect it to be more of a restaurant versus a cafe."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try this one as we have been to the original often for lunch. Saturday afternoon...only one other couple at the bar so we bellied up. Bartender was quite chatty...annoyingly so. He also had a complete rip in back of his pants so everytime he turned and bent over...well, you get the idea. We asked for menu...he gave us the full menu and we order the calamari to start. While we waited (and listened to his incessant opinions on everything from apartment's to variants of the menu that he would like better) my wife noticed an entry on the chalkboard announcing a \"bar bites\" menu. As it was after 3:30 when we got there and this \"special menu\" is available after 3...we asked him for one. Well...it has the regular apps for $5...yep including the calamari that we already ordered from regular menu at full price. He laughed and said oh...my bad. I should've given you this first. Then he went about bar prep right in our way...actually splashing me and the counter (phone) with his sloppy glass washing. Calamari was undercooked. We had enough and got the check. He did not give us the detailed receipt, because he did not adjust the app price.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"We had brunch after church. I have the  chicken tacos. They were great.  The Pico de Gallo had to be house made tasted so fresh had a little kick to it. Chicken was well season and sauce was a great compliment. I wish they provided more Pico.   My wife had the Ohio city breakfast. She got the eggs scrambled with cheese. She enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients.  She wished the fruit was served in a bowl on the side, they were warm."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in the area. You can get s burger cooked as you asked for!  Most places it will be well done no matter what you ask for, I ask for medium rare and that's what I get!  It's also quality beef and the fries are fresh and cooked right too.  Decent draft selection and the other food beside burgers is good."}
{"text":"I thought my burger was not so great, but the Moroccan fries with saffron aioli are to die for."}
{"text":"Ill begin with the negatives since those are what really matter. I ordered the crab Benedict and it may have been enough to feed a mouse. The portions were ridiculously small. The crab cake used was terrible, tasted like a Gordon fish stick with extra fish smell. For a $16 Benedict, you must do better. When there are so few hash brown cubes that you can count how many there are before eating them, you know you've been had. Just a thumbs down on this one, would not order again if I ever return. This place is obviously owned by a hipster that grew up with too much entitlement. If you are gonna open a restaurant in a conservative area like this, you better be on your A game! If two people are gonna pay $40-50 for brunch, they better not leave hungry. Now for the positives. Very very clean! Very nice decor inside. Very pretty and young servers. The menu options were top notch, great ideas! Very attractive menu items. Management simply needs help in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Very nice interior. Perfect waitress (Kerri) who knew menu and the apex of a host. Food was delicious. Drinks strong and well made."}
{"text":"I asked server for a burger suggestion and her response was \"hot fire burger\" ($13). She told me it's not just spicy, it actually has great flavor. The burger was so greasy, I sent it back. The cook threw it back on grill & gave new bun. I was with 3 other people as well. My uncle sent his back for same reason. Beside that, 3 out of 4 of us agreed our burgers were pretty tasteless. Only 1 person at my table liked their burger. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We went to Heck's for a nice weekend brunch and were very happy with our choice!  Everything on the menu is gourmet and a great treat!  I ordered the filet mignon benedict, which was a beautiful gourmet take ona  traditional benedict.  However, it was topped with a hearty filet mignon and was stacked on a thick crunchy bread.  The sides included fruit and home fries.  I wasn't quite as impressed with the home fries and felt they lacked a bit of flavor, but overall weren't terrible.  Our service could have been a little better.  We did visit on a busy Sunday morning, but felt that our server was slow to refill drinks and her stops at our table were infrequent."}
{"text":"I miss the old Heck's in Ohio City. Was hoping this place might be able to emulate it. As far as the food & service goes. To me it's just average at best. Nothing special I guess I was spoiled by the excellent food & the charm the old establishment had."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped here while riding to Sandusky and I saw this on Yelp.  If your not paying attention you can drive right past it because it's in a shopping plaza on the other side of Miutchell's Ice cream.  The decor was open and modern.  There are no booths only hightop tables by the bar and tables in the main dining areas indoors and outdoors. The restaurant is kid-friendly. The menu is eclectic and posh, so if your looking for just a good ole' American burger you better go to Five Guys. You wallet is going to pay for eclectic and posh dining too!Our server was fast, couteous, and knowledgable about the menu suggesting his favorite menu items.    I ordered the Halibut with risotto in a tomato based broth and garlic broccolini.  I asked if the cooks could saute my broccolini without garlic and the server was happy to oblige.  My Halibut was cooked perfectly. It was pan seared, lightly seasoned, light, and flaky. The best Halibut I've eaten in a long time.  Wish I could achieve the same results when I cook my Halibut the same way. I'm not a fan of any risotto and why I didn't ask for a substitution when ordering I haven't the slightest clue.  The manager happen to be walking by and overheard me when my husband asked me about the risotto and quickly asked if I wanted another substitution.  I was impressed! I ended up getting macaroni and cheese and shared this with my husband, remember I'm dieting!  Now, my husband on the other hand is not into eclectic and posh menus, hence the Five Guys comment. He ended up ordering a chicken burger, trying to eat healthy, with housemade fries.  His mistake was that the chicken burger was seasoned ground chicken breast made into a burger patty and not a grilled chicken breast.  I would eat this, but I'm not meat and potatoes type of person. Even with the barbeque sauce he added on top he wasn't happy and ended up eating all his fries and my mac and cheese.  All in all, I would go back to try the wild mushroom ravioli and one of the juicy 100% grass fed beef burgers that came passing by us on the plates going to patrons dining out on the patio."}
{"text":"Met friends there for dinner. I had the BBQ sampler and the brisket was the best I have ever had outside of Texas.  Wife and another had the filet medallions and loved them as did the person who got the walleye. All the food was fresh, perfectly prepared and excellent and reasonably priced for the level of quality. Our waitress was also great. If we had a complaint is was that they have s lot of bright white lights in the place and it kinda killed any high class mood or ambiance.  We were there on a Saturday night and by 9:30 we were the only customers in the place. Quite surprising.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Despite the part where we were seated in the back of the restaurant by the bathrooms which I hate, food was good- burgers were tasty (even the veggie burger) and fries were hand cut and delicious!  Service was adequate but nothing to write home about...  Overall - I prefer the original Ohio City locale for its charm and feel."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on the food however we never made it that far.  After putting our name on the list and being told there is a 20 minute wait. We sat down and reviewed the menu.  The girl with red hair was very nice and offered us drinks and then it happened....... we saw tables opened and no one offering them to the people that were waiting in excess of 45 minutes.  RESERVATIONS..... really. Your a burger joint!!! Not Pier W.  I could see call ahead seating but to make people wait even longer for a table because of reservations is absolutely  ridiculous.  I wish I could comment on the food because we were starving. We decided to go to the Cambria hotel and it was amazing... no wait and great food.... if you really want to try Hecks I guess you better make a reservation.... and for the owner... I hope you reconsider and extend call ahead seating  rather than reservations!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, and atmosphere!  The only reason I cannot give 5 stars was due to the onslaught of flies that were a result of their choice to keep the big doors open that go out to the patio.  Keep that door closed to keep out the pesky flies, and this place is great!"}
{"text":"Aug 26th, ordered a well done burger to go. Bartender & waitress great, burger not right. Real pink. Oh, well. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Greated nicely.  Seated quickly.  Clean and new.  Everything well laid out.  Had Ahi nacho app.  It was ok.  Not bad not great.   Ordered a house salad with chicken.  It was very good.  I also ordered a black and blue burger. It was very good.   We ending with a chocolate shake.  All in all very good.   Great start hecks"}
{"text":"Such a boring location and restaurant design though not surprising for Avon.  Food is mediocre and overpriced given the lack of quality.  Burgers and the toppings were undersized with a soggy bun, while the fries were also so so.  Appetizer selection was standard fare and the salmon entree looked like the best way to go."}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't order a glass of wine I thought the poor was short and the owner told the bartender to measure it with a 4 ounce pour .of water.  I have been in the business for 30 years and never ever had that happen I did it right in front of me  right where I can see yet so embarrassed for this business very bad for customer service.  Yep I'll run right back here."}
{"text":"i have been to heck's  a few times now and i think the food is ok, nothing to RAVE about. i love the outdoor patio. i am a big ol fan of those outside twinkle lights, so anytime i see those, i tend to get uber excited. (i am a girl, ok?! we get excited by silly things like sparkly lights!) anyway, i have had a few of the burgers, which are pretty good. i LOVE the malt vinegar aioli. like LOVE it. if you love malt vinegar on your fries and MAYO, then this is your go to.  i am not a vegetarian or vegan but i did try the veggie burger and was pretty impressed. the fresh cut fries are a treat as well.  i do think that the menu is a little on the higher end, for what you get. has that stopped me from going back? nah.  i like that the avon area is getting more dining options. i like that they offer brunch too!"}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but I have to drop a star compared to my last visit.   We came in here tonight for an early dinner and were the only customers in the entire establishment. We were immediately seated and given menus to look over. I remember there being dinner specials the last time we came and inquired. They did not have a printed out menu so our waitress had to go write them all down. Waters took about 10 minutes to come to the table... Again, we were the only ones there! We watched as the bartenders casually made our drinks... They seemed more intrigued by each other's conversation. The Blackberry Bourbon Smash was fantastic but the Hot Dahlia was not up my alley. Service was just all over slow for 1 occupied table.   The food was average. I do NOT recommend the calamari--quite possibly the worst thing I have had in a long time (please note attached picture). It just looked unappetizing. Mushroom ravioli with Ohio City pasta was pretty good, as were the rosemary garlic fries. Salted Caramel Pretzel Bread Pudding was the star of the dinner.   Overall, I'd say I'm kind of disappointed with Heck's. Our bill was over $100 for 3 people and I do not feel like we got our money's worth, both food and service wise."}
{"text":"Great food tho the breakfast burrito was bafflingly served on a very large and heavy wood cutting board. Other 3 plates at table were however on appropriate ware. #misplacedpretension take care"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Heck's in Ohio City for years now and I can't say I've ever had a bad experience.  The food at this location is the exact same as their original location.  The restaurant is really nice, but doesn't compare to their Cleveland location.  Overall, great restaurant to try, but make sure that you try the original!"}
{"text":"When in Avon, my husband and I always make sure to stop into Heck's Cafe! We love everything about it- from quality of the food, attentive service, chic design to the clean and modern atmosphere. Highly recommend any of the burgers, which are served with fries and a pickle. Also, something to try is any of their house-made sauces, they are all delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Best burger on west side! Nice draft beers on tap! Patio is great in the summer. One of top spots in Avon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we waited this long to try it, but there's no doubt we'll be going back soon as we had an awesome experience. The menu was diverse with plenty of options for lighter eats, the service was great and I was WOW'ed by the vast drink menu. I enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much, and would give it 6 stars if I could. My favorite: loved the big jugs behind the bar filled with vodkas and fruits for infusing. A+"}
{"text":"I looked up their menu online and it sounded incredible!! I was so looking forward to a delicious meal on a Friday evening with my husband. I got the hot fire burger. This should be renamed. There was absolutely nothing even spicy about it!!! Overall it was completely tasteless. The only taste to the whole thing was the pretzel bun it came on. The fries were good though. My husband ordered the Rocky River burger, which he said was amazing. To finish up we tried the smores milkshake and it was honestly disgusting. It tasted burnt and nasty and it gave me a bad taste all night. Service was fine. They had a good drink menu. That's really all I can say good about this place :("}
{"text":"A surprise find while traveling in Cleveland. Did a quick lunchtime search on YELP and found Heck's. It was a horrible weather day so no one was eating outside but the patio looked spacious.  Had the Caprese and avocado salad with Salmon. Well executed dish and service was great. I would definitely recommend Heck's for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance! I've noticed all the low reviews are for the price, however coming from California, the prices are great and the food is wonderful. Love this place and will be returning again soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty weak menu. It's either burger or burger.  Waitress was nice. Food was average. Nothing special going on here."}
{"text":"Tasty fries and burgers. The French onion soup lead off the day with some powerful flavors hidden underneath an outstanding protective coating of cheese.   The cauliflower burger was out A1 and we also devoured an Avon burger (classic mushroom onion and cheese).  I let the server choose my meal and this was her option. The burger itself is so very flavorful it's hard to go wrong here.   As far as the fey choices go it's win win. The Moroccan was my favorite but the garlic rosemary stand and deliver.   Overall it's a menu I need to explore further because it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food. Had a burger and it was 7/10. All burgers cooked to medium temperature even if you ask for medium rare. Waiter was awesome. Based on the service alone I'd be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Quality atmosphere. Incredible steak. Great service. The bread pudding desert ranks in my top 5 desserts of all time. Only negative was potato wedges that were paired with the salmon. The salmon was very good but I would prefer it paired with rice or something lighter. I think the wedges under value the dish. All around really great dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced! Been here now for lunch, tasted like a typical Wendy's burger with less mess.  Brunch today, making the review as I sit in the restaurant, WAY overpriced for a brunch! Disgusting corned beef that tasted like gummy slime with some grease! Terrible!  This place needs normal coffee! Cinnamon is not everyone's choice. Others were saying things about it!  After speaking verbally to the owner, I am extremely happy with the outcome and possibilities to come!"}
{"text":"Checked out this little bar & grill for dinner.  \"Eh\"  Pros: -Delicious burgers - many burger choices & truly scrumptious! -Fantastic milkshakes. But they're small. But they're delish.  -Full bar  Cons: -Pricey. $35 for 2 burgers & a milkshake.  -Limited menu. Not a whole lot to choose from.   Bottom line? I probably won't check out this place again."}
{"text":"It's not the stellar original restaurant in Ohio City, but worth a stop. They continue to have a good mix on the menu and gluten free options including buns."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, very friendly staff, beautiful cocktails. My husband and I ate here for brunch Memorial Day and both had the Wild Things omelette. So delicious!!! Patio is gorgeous too!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first dining experience at Heck's Cafe. I loved the atmosphere and structure of the building.  The service was very slow for breakfast.  Food was decent, but nothing to brag home about.  Menu is bigger than the bite."}
{"text":"This review is for take-out milk shakes. We just left the Duluth Trading company and my husband really craved a milkshake. With a quick search online, he found Heck's Cafe.   It's not hard to find, but the strip mall has a lot options and might be a little confusing. We found it, but I stayed in the car (I was sick). We pulled up the menu online. The milkshake options are great! nutella, strawberry, vanilla, etc. I opted for strawberry and he for vanilla. He went in and asked if we could get take out. He came back to the car, laughing. The ladies inside were so happy and eager to help him. In the few minutes it took to get the shakes, he said 6 people had to ask if he had been helped yet. I wish we lived closer to visit more often and try more milk shakes!   My strawberry was AMAZING! I should have ordered two - would love to try to nutella next time."}
{"text":"This place was good, I liked the atmosphere, it was quiet and pleasant. Prices were moderate but not horrible. They're burgers are awesome! My husband and I got two different burgers and we loved them both, cooked well. And they give a huge amount of fries for the side, a lot more than I could eat. We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"The 3 star average seems appropriate for this place. This new location is nice on the inside with light that shines in through many windows for a pleasant morning brunch. The Heck's signature coffee has a special cinnamon flavor recipe that is unique.   The brunch is good, however, the price/portion ratio is way too high for breakfast/brunch food, even of this quality. You should feel full from a typical brunch for $15-$20 but it was not the case. Though it's not my first instinct to go here, that doesn't necessarily mean I won't ever try it again."}
{"text":"After church, I wanted a cute, upscale brunch place to have a nice meal without feeling like I was going to a chain. Heck's is in also in Ohio City and I know people who love it and have been going there forever. So, I gave the one in Avon a try this morning. It opens fairly late for Sunday brunch at ten thirty and we walked in right as it opened. After one glance at the menu, it looks pricey- but for good brunch, I'm willing to splurge. We started with an appetizer of the baked Brie that was such a disappointment. It comes with bread to spread it on that tastes like a literal piece of bagged bread toasted on each side. The Brie was plain and slightly burnt and the raspberries and blueberries were plain on top of raspberry jam. Blueberries are not easy to eat with Brie and felt very arbitrary.   Next, for brunch, I had the country fried steak. Again, it came out tasting very burnt, so I sent it back thinking they just overcooked it. No- it's supposed to come that way. I've had country fried steak from all over the south and never has it been so dark brown/black and so heavily battered.   I sent it back and received a hash instead. It had a million ingredients that felt very jumbled and mismatched. Mushrooms, squash, zucchini, potatoes, cooked onions, broccoli and goat cheese put on top in awkward clumps.   I'm sixteen and work a minimum wage job, so spending forty three dollars on a terrible brunch is a big deal to me. Heck's was a major flop and I wish I simply went to Bob Evan's.   Three words to describe it: Overpriced Disorganized  Underwhelming"}
{"text":"Heck's has had a long history of excellence in Ohio City, and it was nice to see them grow. I've not eaten at this location before, and while the food was good, it was over priced. I had the perch special, which, at $24, was heavily breaded, served over soggy French fries and a pittance of coleslaw. My wife had the mushroom ravioli, which was pretty good, but nearly a third of the plate was bread. That entree was $20. Add a soft drink, and the bill cane to $48, plus tip. While the service was solid, I just can't justify that kind of cost for the so-so quality of food we received. So many other options for better food and at a more reasonable cost."}
{"text":"I have heard how great this place was for years yet have never been. For someone who has given up both pork and red meat, I was hesitant to try Heck's because all I've heard about it was how great the burgers are. (I don't like going to burger or steak places unless you get burgers or steak. ) But my husband and I were out in Avon with a planned Costco shopping trip and wanted to have brunch beforehand. Heck's had a brunch, so I said I'd like to try it.  And now...I will be back...both for brunch and an anytime meal. I usually have difficulty  finding a brunch dish I want to try due to lack of choices for someone who does not eat the traditional breakfast meats. Here I had a difficult time trying to choose from all of their interesting options. I was lured to Heck's by the Edamame burger, but then when I actually read the brunch menu, I grappled with my decision among that, the turkey or salmon burger, soup and salad or the root veggie hash. I wanted to try them all.  I chose the salmon burger with a lemon pepper aioli and it was delicious. The patty did fall apart easily, but I didn't mind. I don't  love fresh cut fries, personally, but dipped in their garlic aioli, I would them all...  ...then  I went back for brunch. I ordered the butternut squash dish. For all you vegetarians  out  there, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was definitely not my favorite meal.  I got one a drink for $9, an appetizer for $9 and literally just one spare rib for $24.  $50 later I walked out to get an ice cream with a huge take out box with a very very small bit of my one spare rib that i saved for my dog.  I was still hungry and had to get an ice cream to fill up.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This weekend my hubby and I went to Heck's for the first time. Our server was awesome. She was super attentive and did a great job thinking about our needs and being proactive. We came on the weekend and didn't realize that there was only a brunch menu. I have some food allergies, so it was a bit difficult to find something on the menu. I settled on the Rocky River burger. It was pretty good, but lack enough seasoning/salt. The mushrooms has little flavor. My husband got the au chèvre burger and really enjoyed it comparing it to B Spot (his favorite). Fries were okay. I'd go if in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and this was my second visit. I think this place is awesome! I was immediately greeted by a smiling face who offered to seat me. I chose the bar for appetizers and a drink. Both times my drinks have been wonderful! The bartender from Friday day was polite and informative with menu choices and beverages. I had the stuffed peppers and they were amazing! Just the right amount of spice and sweet. Hecks is just such a great place! I will continue to frequent this place, it's one of my favorite locations in Avon!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the staff from our greeting to our most Fabulous waitress Sara, over the top! Fadi you did it again! Love love Hecks! The food delicious, wine selections wonderful and desserts too die for the bread pudding is unreal!! Sara thank you for making our dining experience so great!  Can't wait to go back!!   Ivette and Joe Rocky River"}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary I ordered (bacon flavored vodka) tasted very weird - gritty texture and very acidic - as if lots of lemon juice and ground black pepper added, perhaps. However, it did not taste like bacon and so overwhelmed by lemon I could barely taste tomatoes. So, weird, to put it simply. My entree was the Wild Things brunch bowl (served in a bowl). It was good - glad I asked for extra goat cheese - but not great. Potatoes not undercooked but bland and not crispy or crusty. Arugula fresh, but maybe would have liked it sautéed?"}
{"text":"We had brunch at Heck's recently and we really enjoyed it.  Server was helpful - recommended the Avocado toast and it was delicious, good coffee, and great service.  We were able to sit outside, beautiful weather, we just really enjoyed it.  Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  The food doesn't taste as good as it looks.  My wife enjoyed her salad and cauliflower burger. The onion soup was basically broth; it tasted good,  but for $6, we were expecting more.  The fresh fries were good,  but the Greek burger was a let down.  The lamb on the burger was processed (the waitress told me it was brought in fresh cut). The hamburger itself was cooked perfectly,  but it had no seasoning at all. We may give it one more try, because the drink menu is quite fun."}
{"text":"Between myself & friend, we split 3 appetizers. In all fairness I new I was going to hate 1 in advance. It wasn't my choice. The other 2 were my choice & were just OK. They weren't bad, just bland. Nice atmosphere. Fun people. I'll go back for drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff & great vibe. We're in from New York for the day & were seriously impressed. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Since I'm a good burger fan, and I know a good burger when I see one (inserts welcome to good burger joke here) I decided this place was worth a try. I can say without a doubt that the burgers here are awesome, however, the drinks and food together are pricy. I ordered a tea, and the bill came to 5$ for just the tea. Total was 45$ just for the tea and a burger w/fries.   If the prices would be worked out a little bit better, I'd give this place 5*'s. I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and good service.  First time here.  Had one of the hash plates with chicken, mushrooms and goat cheese. Deserts looked out of this world and the drinks looked fantastic.  Great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"Just okay. Went on New Years Day - not many people there (cold day). Two burgers - both were fine, middle of the road taste. Waitress was a little slow mo. Most disappointing was the herbed rice...no flavoring or evidence of a herbs."}
{"text":"Boy this place is always busy. Now I know why!  Enjoyed a delicious burger for lunch with a coworker. The Cajun Burger with house fries came out hot and fresh...and perfect!  They know they have to be quick for lunch.  By far the best burger you can get in the Avon/Avon Lake area. The ability to get either a 1/4lb or a 1/2lb burger is plus."}
{"text":"Okay food, prices are high for the quality you get. Not a great selection. If they drop their prices 30% this would go up a few Stars. It's all about the value in my mind and they don't have it, there are better options"}
{"text":"Excellent food. My service was actually great for a change! Only thing I could recommend is getting more beers into the actual place itself. All in all..very pleased"}
{"text":"They were out of my first two lunch entree menu choices at 12:55p (fish and chips + salmon)    Seems a bit early to be out of lunch when you only carry 8 or so entrees.  A grilled cheese, house salad, kids cheese burger, and chicken sandwich took a lumbering 42 minutes to arrive.  The chicken was burnt to a crisp.... I mean it was really bad.   On a positive note, staff and manager were really nice and gave my girls a sundae.   They will have to put out a better quality product to the table much faster to survive in Avon. (Families don't wait 40 mins for food)"}
