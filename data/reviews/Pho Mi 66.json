{"text":"Excellent service, tasty and fresh food, priced right. 5/5 place. Must go !! Rice with pork, fried fish and fried egg was delicious and flavourful. Fresh Vietnamese rolls were really fresh.  Pho with bbq pork, minced pork and egg noodles was 5/5. I would love to go again."}
{"text":"I really liked the food there! Got rice seafood and vegetables R17 ( if I remember correctly!). My friend got soup- the portion is huge! Large bowl. Hers was M3. She loved it a lot too. We are coming back tomorrow for sure! Very affordable and delicious. so much variety they offer! We have spend about 10 min reviewing what to pick from menu! Healthy choices and a lot of meaty options. Will be back, positive!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this restaurant on a Friday afternoon after hearing some favorable reviews of this place. Place was easily accessible and there were plenty of free parking at the time. The restaurant was bright and spacious with plenty of seating. I ordered a bowl of their xl special pho. The noodles were very tasty and reasonably priced for their size. I would say it's one of the better Pho places in Brampton. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled pork chop And chicken with rice, meats were a bit dry but it was a great portion and price. Complementary little bowl of soup and tea! Offers much more condiments and sauces than my usual place.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Went here a few days back and it was great food for a great price. Lots of different varieties to choose from and the dishes other than the phone are pretty good too. Service was ok took a while to get our bill and leave but that's the only negative if any."}
{"text":"The rolls were greasy rolls and the broth was  tasteless.  The owner was going around the restaurant killing flies with his bug zapper. I will not go back and will avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Awesome pho!  Very good and fresh food in a beautiful clean room.  But they either need to explain the ordering and payment set up or change it. Service is severely lacking and there was a language barrier. Too bad because the food is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Took my friend to eat for his belated bday and this is quite a good place!  Great food for your money as everything was a good price.  Definitely get your monies worth!  I ordered the seafood and meat crunchy chow mein...which was ok...not much flavour for me and had to load it with hoisin and hot sauce.  Noodles were crunchy, but I've had better.  The fresh rolls and spring rolls were good.  My friends got the assorted meat on rice and that right there is definitely bang for your buck.  Big piece of chicken, pork chop, sunny-side egg, shredded pork skin and some other egg pattie thing.  The portion size is great for that plate, I'm getting that next time!!  Loved their shakes!  I've had avocado before this visit and that day I had durian...so yummy!  I still have my top pho place to go to, but this one is a close runner up."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and clean. I was a little confused on how to order. We didn't realize that we were supposed to write down our order on the blank check that was left on the table. The food was very good. The sauces were delicious. I can't give it five stars because of the service. We were served our food and that was it. We weren't checked on. We weren't asked if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"This place is relatively new and decided to check them out. I usually go to the pho place next to Seasons Market on Kennedy for my fix of Vietnamese food. Good thing I tried this place out! It's better food at a better price. I went with my family and I got to try their vegetarian fried noodle, their pho dac biet (special), and the bo bun hue. The broth was really clean and have the just right amount of fat for my taste and it came with a good amount of meat. Their pho dishes also come in medium to XL bowls which is good if you want to save some of your appetite for an appetizer or fill you up with just one dish.  Would definitely recommend and would come back again"}
{"text":"Just checked this place with the wife and kids, been open for one week.  If your familiar with the many pho places around the GTA this place is no different. Many Vietnamese dishes alongside the pho offerings with a extensive Thai menu as well.  We ordered the bbq pork with egg noodle soup, along with grilled chicken pork and rice. Last dish we ordered was the satay chicken which was really good.  Service was fast and efficient, while food while did not blow me out of the water was good enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Delicious! Pho was flavorful and our food came really fast. I enjoyed it so much I finished the whole bowl. Come here if you want good pho."}
{"text":"They have a really good egg noodle special.. their broth is very tasty and don't really need to add much just hot sauce of you like your soups spicy.. another item I recommend is their fresh rolls with shrimp and pork their rolls don't fall apart and the dipping sauce is really good.."}
{"text":"Pros.  -Food was good -lots of parking  -everything was clean and tidy -quick service -washrooms were clean  -quick checkout  Cons. -the server was topping off the condiments while I was eating. Reaching across the table    -the serving for the drinks were a bit small. 3 bean dessert"}
{"text":"Pho broth, average at best. BBQ pork rice 'ok', not great for 10 bucks (when did rice get so expensive?!)."}
{"text":"Came along steeles in Brampton and seen this pho place so I had to come in and give it a try ... Service was good and friendly place was very clean and bright was the food was great and i definitely will be back ."}
{"text":"Always good food and friendly service. Servers are quick and helpful. They have great vegetarian options. Pad Thai is excellent. Sit in or take out food preparation is efficient."}
{"text":"Was hungry and in the mood for Thai, googled this place and used the directions. Could not find it at the location as per maps but found Thai Express pretty close to it so went there instead. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"solid choice!  i live nearby so i've been a couple times now.  pho is consistently good and hasn't been over-salted.  meat is sparse, however the quality is decent and it eats well.  location is clean, service is fast, owner asked us about the meal as we left which has *never* happened to me at a pho place.  much better than the pho mi 99 at steeles & hurontario..  i would come back to this location over 99 any time."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it. Food came fast. Loved the pickled Habanero sauce.  Pho is decent. Didn't see bun bo hue on menu. Spring rolls are fantastic.   ---------update------ Came to this place again. Really loved it again. Clean, high ceiling, really attentive servers. Found Bun Bo Hue this time. It is soooo good. Had the grilled pork rolls A1 and they were so fresh and flavourful. Almost had half jar of picked Habanero.  Very authentic dishes. Officially my favourite pho place in GTA!"}
{"text":"Always excited to try a new pho place, especially when it's local!  The place is actually really pretty. I guess that fact that it's still new and everything is still clean and pristine helps too.  First of all, they have a WIDE selection of food on their menu. It was almost TOO many things. Despite that, my friend and I both ordered the pork chop and chicken on rice (R7). This came out in record timing. I'd say it took about 7 minutes for the food to come lol, no joke.  The food came with a side soup aka pho broth. I liked this touch. My usual pho place doesn't do this, so this was a one up for Pho Mi 66. The pork chop was good and the chicken was even better! Again, the chicken here was better than my usual spot. The meat portions aren't pinch either. I was definitely full.  Will for sure come back! This will be one of my regular pho joints. Prices are on point too! So cheap!"}
{"text":"I don't quite possibly understand how anyone can give this place less than 4 stars! This has been my favorite go-to Pho place in Brampton! Lucky enough to live near this  gem.   Great food, nice atmosphere and good value for your money. Staff is super friendly and I adore the decor.   Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I come here fairly often when I am craving a bowl of pho and spending the weekend in Brampton. The service is quick and courteous. The space is very clean, has a few booths and has decor that includes all things flashy (sparking tables, neon signs on the wall etc..). Their pho broth is delicious, clear and perfectly seasoned for cold fall evenings. I do believe there is MSG in their broth as I felt a bit thirsty afterwards but tasty none the less. Their shrimp, rice paper spring rolls are compact and filled with fresh ingredients. I also like how they have a extensive selection of condiments that you can put on your pho including hot sauce, hoisin sauce to chilli's and even sesame oil -- all at your finger tips. To top things off, their prices are lower than most places and their portion of meat to noodles is even. If you are in the mood for pho and are in the neighbourhood, I would recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"We were new to Toronto and were looking for some good Vietnamese's foods.  My son was graving for a good bowl of Pho.  We ordered two Large bowls of Pho Dac Biet, Bun Bo Hue, Seafood Fried Rice, and Sinh To Sau Rieng.  The bowls of soups were extremely big. Everything was very fresh and tasty.  We enjoyed every bites.  The restaurant was nicely decorated.  The waiters and cashier were kind and friendly.  We would definitely come back next time we are in the area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was good.  Phõ was tasty. The fresh roll was big but not great. Fried roll was good. Clean place including the washroom."}
{"text":"Great Pho restaurant! Delicious flavours, typical style of Pho. Got the TomYum, can't go wrong for this tomato based spicy soup, seafood, beef or chicken are always a good option. Get the fresh spring rolls, they make them nice and large, and come with sauce to dip. I would defiantly come back here!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food in Canada! We came from the USA, in trek of a good home cooked Vietnamese restaurant.... we found it across the street from our hotel.   We had bùn bo hu, canh chua, ca chin, pho,  and 6 durian smoothies!!! Go eat NOW."}
{"text":"Came here because I noticed it was new in the area. The place is modern, the service is quick, the menu consist of items you would normally find at a vietnamese restuarant. I ordered v12. Which was a spicy vegetarian stir fry on rice noodles.  I was extremely disappointed as there wasn't any spice and it was a little bland.  As soon as I saw it I asked of it was the right order because it didn't look like the description. They said that it's not a spicy dish and it was probably translated wrong because they green peppers were translated as spicy. I would of been happy if they took it back and make me something spicy or that matches the description but they just said  \" no that's not spicy\". So i just put hot sauce all over it and ate it. So I'll give them 3 stars. I'll probably come back and try other items. But I think Ill stick to pho mi 99 when I'm in brampton."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot! My food was ready within 10 minutes and was everything I was hoping for and expecting. I'm in the Brampton area frequently for work and I'll definitely be visiting again."}
