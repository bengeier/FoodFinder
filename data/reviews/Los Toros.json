{"text":"First visit table of three. 2 pitchers of margaritas were excellent. The service was fantastic and the chips and salsa starter was accompanied by beans to scoop. The decor is nice and bright with light. The entire staff will ask if every thing is good, can we get you anything. I loved it. Our waiter was so much fun."}
{"text":"Been there one time so far and was a terrible experience. Waited forever for the food. Families that came in after us got all their food and were done by the time we got ours. Food wasn't that great and made some of us sick. 1/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just had early dinners here. We had the fajitas del Mar for two. The scallops and shrimp were cooked nicely, but my goodness there was a ton of scallops and about six shrimp between the two of us. The ratio should fall the other way. The peppers and onions were badly overcooked, like the cook didn't account for residual cooking on the skillet used for serving. There was only one server and she was stretched pretty thin. There were two errors on our bill but those were quickly temedied. 

We have eaten here before and had enchiladas and rellenos. Those were really really good and the service then was good. They also give you a huge Stein of ice cold imported beer for six bucks. We'll probably try again sometime and I'll revise this post if we get a different outcome."}
{"text":"They were amazing. The staff was so patient with me since I'm a super picky eater and hate bell peppers in my food. I was part of a large group of family members. They did such a great job. I would go there again in a heartbeat. The cheese sauce they gave us with the chips was super yum. I wish I could find chips exactly like the ones at restaurants. Now for a taste of almost everything get either the choose your own combo or the Special plate. The Daiquiris are a dream. I had a virgin strawberry one since I don't drink alcohol. Bottom line if you want good Mexican food and you are in Lorain Ohio go herr."}
{"text":"Fist time and not bad.
Food came out pretty quick after ordering.
Meals were good 
Might give Don Tequila some competition.
Dropping stars as we sit waiting for check.
Also received 1 napkin with silverware and did not receive any additional, even after requesting them."}
{"text":"Finally a good Mexican Food restaurant in the Amherst area. Good food, generous quantities, and competent and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this Mexican restaurant a try. It was just...ok. The restaurant is lit very bright. Reminds me of a cafeteria. We ordered the Texan margarita pitcher. The margaritas were decent. Not too strong. Not too weak. Our server was young and didn't know much about alcohol. She was a bit confused when we asked for a \"Texan\" margarita. I ordered the chori pollo. I must say that it was delicious. I ate the entire thing. It could have been that I was so hungry. The others that I dined with never complained about their food as well. The food came out fast and it was nice and hot. I had a $5 dollar off coupon for a purchase
Over $25 and the \"cashier\" lady stated that the system wouldn't let her give us the discount because of liquor. Despite the liquor purchase, my bill was way over $25. It seems like the staff needs to be better acquainted with their menu and alcohol selections as well as getting trained on their PoS system. So, give this place a try and determine whether you enjoy their service and food. For me, it was a typical Mexican restaurant. Nothing to travel out of your way for; there are better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Excellent.... Phenomenal! Food and service were very good. If you haven't been, check it out. Chicken chili and burro steak."}
{"text":"Walked in without a reservation, busy restaurant. Food came very fast and was quite good. Being Hispanic myself the food did not dissappoint. Was there on a night where mariachi band played...what a treat."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  Loved our waitress she made sure we had chips and salsa to take home."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Should have known when we came in and had to find someone to seat us that it was not going to be good.  We ordered and sat. No one ever came back.  Finally, after an hour someone showed up and asked us what we ordered.  We told them we had been waiting an hour. Someone else came back and asked us what we ordered. We told them again. We waited another ten minutes and left. We never got our food. Will not go back. Place will probably go out of business."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times.  The food is ok but unfortunately on each visit the food comes to the table only LUKE WARM !  After only a couple of minutes the rice and beans are COLD.  Each visit I have ordered something different and on each visit  the food is only luke warm, never hot, and all the food is cold before you can finish it and I'm a fast eater"}
{"text":"Los Toros it's my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Lorain/Amherst area. The food is top-notch, the staff and owners are amazing. I hope this new business lasts a long long time it is a great asset to the community!"}
{"text":"Very good food with friendly staff. Patient and courteous. The place is warm and inviting. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good food, very reasonably priced. Service was OUTSTANDING!!!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good, chicken cooked well, rice and beans deli deli. There were some things that I would have changed- like asked for a straw for the water glass, more chippies, more lettuce for my plate, but alas, no one stopped to check. Rita's should come w Prilosec. We didn't even see the waiter during dinner. Also, asked for Rita's on the rocks and came back frozen! couldn't switch it even if we wanted to be cunts and complain,as there was no service past the taking of and delivery of our order.  Food good, service not so good. Take care


Add; just came back again, and again food was good and service was not so much. Actually waitress was rude and inattentive and messed up order"}
{"text":"They were not busy so we got excellent service and attention. The food was fresh and hot and the drinks were cold and strong. This was my 2nd visit and it was better than the first...keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"We've  tried this place a couple times. You get seated but you can't get waited on. And you don't get good service. And you don't get what you ordered. This is becoming an Ohio thing. Bad food and bad service. This place is just terrible."}
{"text":"Just tried this place I think we have found a new mexican restaurant to visit everything was excellent"}
{"text":"Love it. The chimichangas are excellent.  My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Staff is friendly and chicken was very tender. My friend had steak which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with party of four.  We were seated immediately and our server came to the table within a few minutes with tortilla chips and salsa.  She took our drink orders, returned quickly with them and took our appetizer orders.  Appetizers were out within ten minutes at which time the server took our dinner orders.  Dinners arrived at the table very quickly.  Server asked if we needed anything else then left us to dine.  She returned a few times during dinner to see if we needed anything.  Once dinner was complete the plates were quickly removed and dessert orders were taken.  Again the desserts were brought out very quickly and when we were finished the plates were removed and our check was brought.  Food was very good, service was good and the prices were very reasonable.  We wii be returning and with their extensive menu trying something different will not be a problem."}
