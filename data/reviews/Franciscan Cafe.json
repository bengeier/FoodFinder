{"text":"Enjoyed our stay at Cibola - the staff was super friendly at the Cafe and food was fresh. Drinks were wonderful and we even learned how to make a Sonoran Sunset Signature drink."}

{"text":"Franciscan Cafe is located at the adult pool area within Cibola Vista Resort & Spa.   It's a nice little spot with a full bar where you can grab tasty beverages, and choose from a selection of apps, salads, sandwiches / wraps, burgers, dogs and pizzas.   

The bartenders make good mixed / frozen drinks and they have a great selection of beers, with several on tap and lots of canned options.  Domestic draft beers are very reasonably priced, especially for a resort.  They also do a great job of frozen drinks for the kiddos like virgin daiquiris, virgin pi√±a coladas, and frozen cherry lime-aids.  Their powerful misting system makes sitting at or near the bar comfortable even on the hottest of Arizona summer days.   

During our stay, I tried the following food items:  

Southwest Chicken Wrap:  Huge - and had the potential to be awesome - but despite the list of great sounding ingredients (diced chicken, corn, black beans, tomato, lettuce, onions, cheddar & jack cheeses & southwest ranch sauce), it was just OK.   Didn't really seem to have a lot of flavor.

Beer batter fries:  Large portion!   Ordered for the table & excellent.  Great full flavor fries.

Mozzarella sticks:  Ordered on 2 different days - my step daughter said she liked them a lot, I tried them both days and also liked them.  Pretty good.   

Nachos: To share between 3 of us.  The nachos were sub-par.  The chips appeared to be super cheap, were tasteless, and the \"cheese sauce\" had no flavor and the consistency of something that comes out of a vat, although the side of salsa was good.  

Note that there are two pool areas at Cibola Vista -- the main pool complex which has it's own bar that never seems to be open, and the adult pool area, which has Franciscan Cafe.    Something I found ironic -- you can order food & beverage from the Franciscan Cafe to be delivered to your condo and you can drink / dine at the Franciscan Cafe within the adult pool area, but if you're at the main pool complex, there is no waiter service.   You have to exit the main pool complex, walk across the resort and into the adult pool area where Franciscan is located, order  / retrieve your own food and drinks and then take them back to the main pool complex with you.  I don't understand this at all.   There should be wait staff walking around the pool complex at all times during business hours serving food and drink or, at the very MINIMUM, there should be a food/beverage employee posted at the bar in the main pool complex during operating hours to take orders and have food / drink delivered from Franciscan.  You should not have to walk all the way across the resort  - in and out of four locked key card access gates in a round trip - to get something to drink or eat."}
