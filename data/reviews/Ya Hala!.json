{"text":"Ordinary sandwich at high price with 30 min wait. I could barely find the veggies but amount of meat ok. If there is nothing else open and you are starving go for it!"}
{"text":"I wouldve never known this little gem was here! Buttttt they are also an authorized UHaul dealer.. I reserved over the phone, they are very easy to arrange with. Wally and  his wife are both very nice.. I needed the truck for a few extra hours and they went out of their way to accomodate :)  will write a second review for the UHaul later.. Anyways their market is incredible!! They have all sorts of imported coffees and the traditional arabic hand held expresso maker.. Which i also bought! Not only did Wally advise me on which coffee would suit my taste.. His wife also explained how much to use and exactly how to use the expresso maker.  My first time making it and it was delicious.  They also had a eatery inside but i was unable to try it as i was in a rush... The store itself was very tidy and Wally takes great pride in honest service. I would reccommend this 1 stop shop to anyone in the area! Dont forget to try the coffee! Thanks Wally! :)"}
{"text":"Ya Hala market attracts customers with their $3.99 gyro sign in front of their market. My wife and I decided to each eat the advertised gyro. We were not let down. The amount of meat was surprising for the value. The best part was that it wasn't overpowered with salt like most gyros are. The traditional greek sauce was also good. I think we will try a sandwich next time. They also serve thrifty ice cream. Anyone who has tried it never forgets the name. I would recommend both the gyro and thrifty ice cream.   The market is small but they offer some authentic middle eastern choices. Most of the products have both English and Arabic printed on them. The married owners / operators were kind and helpful. Everyone should pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! Their falafel pita is one of the best I have ever had! How can you go wrong for 6 bucks?! Their gyros are amazing! Can't believe the quality especially since a gyro here is 4 bucks! I always get a side of hummus for a couple dollars extra, and it is some of the tastiest hummus around! Their sub sandwiches are truly amazing! You get a 12 inch sub for 5 dollars! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many choices of food in the mini-market. I love being able to have the option of ethnic food choices such as places like this, and other ethnicities.  It's great that they make the food fresh in front of you. You can even have your ice cream dessert, all without leaving the premises ;-)"}
{"text":"Thank you for making my dinner!  The wife and I where famished and it was 7:15pm while headed to Home Depot. I had a sub and her a gyro. Both awesome, tasty and filling... but the five stars go to the customer service of the owners! It was well after they closed and they still fed us, thank you, thank you. I really hate being that 'last' person in when you're trying to close, but I really did not realize, until AFTER we ordered that you closed at 7pm (my bad). But with that nice favor, we will pay it forward with a good review and will definitely return (in a timely fashion) again and again. I have already made recommendations to my friends on where to find your shop."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to relax and enjoy supreme quality food. The cuisine is authentic Mediterranean and almost anything else you desire."}
{"text":"I'm so excited! This market is wonderful! It looks like it is owned by a husband and wife team. Both are so nice and very helpful.... I grew up on Persian food. This market has so many Middle Eastern goodies like Basmati rice, spices, teas, etc. Just for a new experience go check this place out.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  The gyros was excellent and the baklava was the best I have ever had.  Yes, this place is small but the portions are ample, the food is fresh/homemade and the prices were great.  Wally and his wife keep it clean. simple and VERY tasty.  I love the mom and pop places that work hard and produce superior results because of work ethic and pride.  This place will be a regular in our line up."}
{"text":"My favorite aspect of this fantastic little middle eastern market / U-Haul dealer is their excellent gyros sandwiches.  Service is the best and genuinely warm and friendly."}
{"text":"The guy was super nice but they are selling the business so their selection of middle eastern foods was quite limited. They also had no signage."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty, service was polite and friendly. If I could have some ice with my drink I would have given five stars."}
{"text":"This market and deli (and U-Haul rental shop) is an unexpected delight. I had a delicious falafel sandwich with tasty, fresh hummus and tzatziki - wonderful! They make their own thick pita bread as well. It's a small place, and you have to wait about 5 minutes for them to make the falafel fresh, but it is worth it! Very nice people, as well."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I mean, really hidden. It is next to Home Depot hidden behind another building. You would never know it existed. I'm glad I know it exists!  Inside the store, it is a bit cramped. Not much atmosphere. There are many interesting grocery items.  The food menu is small but covers the basics. I ordered a falafel pita for myself and a gyro for my husband to go. We both loved our pitas! I found the pita bread to be very unique. Lighter than most pita bread I have had. Both my falafel and my husband's gyro meat was perfectly seasoned.  The husband and wife that run the place are very nice. The prices are unbelievably low for such delicious food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Gyro was below average, not gross, but not worth ordering again.  Fries were undercooked and flavorless.  The can of Dr Pepper was delicious."}
{"text":"Had a ham sub with veggies and a drink because I saw the sign outside; sub and drink for 4.99. It was great and the bread was delicious. They said they baked it themselves. I finished off with some chocolate ice cream which was good too.  I had my son who is 8 months old, with me and they were so friendly.  He liked the ice cream too.  They even gave him a sucker. Very nice people and great food. Next time I will try a gyro."}
