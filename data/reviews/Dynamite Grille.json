{"text":"I don't always think of going to a golf club to eat. I usually think it is just for golfers. Dynamite Grill changed my view. The restaurant and bar are well decorated and comfortable. The views are stunning. The service is great, make sure you check in with Stewart behind the bar. We had a light lunch of salad and fabulous tacos.  They also have an outdoor area to watch the sunset. Check it out."}
{"text":"I eat there often with my boyfriend, the food is mostly always good, except for the nachos; the nachos were sparse, with giant chunks of meat and were extremely disappointing all across the board. It was basically a pile of chips someone through a tablespoon of shredded cheese on, along with sprinkling whole cooked black beans sparingly....it was a pathetic site to see to be completely honest. I am a nacho person, and when I see nachos like that it depresses me. Also the last time I ordered a waffle and it was so overcooked that it literally had reverted back to powder form when I tried to put my knife through it."}
{"text":"We have always had a good experience at Troon North grill. Try the nacho appetizers, served at dinner time. Phenomenal to say the least. Service has always been top notch. This is a go to place for all around menu items."}
{"text":"The first time I played Troon North Golf Club I stopped in for lunch and ordered the sliders. I have been back several times, and have always ordered the sliders. I also get a side of fries... Perfect lunch or dinner. They use Kobe beef, and throw some caramelized onions on top. Unreal how good they are. I recently had the chance to eat breakfast AND lunch at Dynamite Grill, and ordered a breakfast burrito. It was also good. 

The best part, besides the sliders, is the coffee. I will literally drive up there just to order a cup of coffee. The staff is also great. You don't need to play golf to have a good experience at Dynamite Grille. Come hungry. Leave happy."}
{"text":"I come here often for breakfast, which is always good. They're open early and are usually pretty quiet since most of their early am crowd are headed to the links. But if it's Tuesday I'm usually here with my friends and neighbors enjoying great margaritas and they're changing menu of $2.50 tacos! Beautiful views and always very friendly service."}
{"text":"Very good.  Tacos ate the best I have ever had anywhere.  Service is perfect and the view outstanding.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch, and it was a buffet for $40/ea which we didn't know until sitting down. Our server was polite, but the service itself was mediocre at best. When we went to leave, they didn't bring our check for the longest time.. Then finally when it came, they auto cheated gratuity at 20%... Seems very shady for a buffet, and considering it was only two of us. Who charges auto gratuity for a buffet, really???"}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos for lunch. The pico was just hot enough, the aioli was perfect--the tacos were delicious. We sat on the deck drinking a beer before our meal with a beautiful view. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Starting with the positives, the views are wonderful and the service was great. Which resulted in rounding up to 3 stars. The food was decidedly average, and 3 out of 4 meals were excessively salty - chicken and prime rib. Hamburger and fries were ok. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Update: The bacon has been repaired!! We have ordered it 2 times since my first review and it was perfect! Still 4.5 stars but with ZERO complaints this time. If you have read any of my reviews you would be impressed by this one.."}
{"text":"Lucy is one of the best wait staff at the Grille.  Linda one of the bartenders is also awesome.  Great view and good food."}
{"text":"Finished a 5 hour round of golf because of scheduling issues on the course side. Not a big deal, the golf staff was apologetic and very nice. So instead of leaving right away, we thought we would spend even more money and stay to grab food and drinks. I literally sat at the bar for 8 minutes in front of the manager and another staff who never bothered to greet me or even look my way. Can't say you didn't see me, I was wearing a bright coral shirt. There was no one else at the bar. You can't tell me that you were so busy making that one mint julep that you couldn't even say hello, both of you and one of you a manager as it said on your name tag. If it weren't for the golf staff, I would say don't waste your time. However the course and the staff were awesome!!! Too bad the customer service quality isn't passed on to the restaurant side.
Clearly it is only a great place for locals and not the many tourists who come there to golf."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with great service.  Really enjoyed the golf course view while dining.  Will be back for Dinner."}
{"text":"Follow up to a previous review of a really spotty experience during lunch for the service earlier in the day.   After my second round and relaxing after 36 holes, Lucy greeted us with a smile and exemplary service through our 19th hole experience as it it should be after dropping almost $500 for golf.  Great job in redeeming yourself.  Will visit again.  Ok back again in 2018 with Jovani and wow, I am so happy I came back.  Awesome service and honored our 25% off our meal for the yelp discount."}
{"text":"And we thought the breakfasts were amazing.  Oh my, the watermelon feta salad is perfectly crafted with an amazing dressing.  Add the bbq brisket tacos with cabbage and salsa and you have a divine lunch to share.  Local draft beers available.  Whether you are a golfer or not, the views, location, service and menu make this grille a must try.  Bar service available.  Happy hour menu from 3 to 6pm."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour and in the summer they close early, so check out times before heading out. The club house area to eat/drink is nice with windows to view a little area of the course. 
They have cheap drink specials and good tacos, hummus and flatbread.
They also have a full menu to dine and specials throughout the week.
If up in the Toon area check it out."}
{"text":"Food is great. Hours very though so call before you go in for sure. Service can vary as well. Some of the staff is great. Some are eh."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the neighborhood and figured a Sunday afternoon lunch close to home made perfect sense. We've been here 4 or 5 times. It's always underwhelming. The cocktails are too expensive and the food is satisfactory at best. We ordered a Cobb salad that came out with the most disgusting fatty bacon I've ever seen. No one...I mean no one would eat this garbage. Add bottom shelf margaritas for $8 and I wish I was back home with my mom cooking. Even though that would mean horrible food and a ban on liquor, I would still prefer her serving up the grub. This was a HUGE disappointment and I fear our last venture to the club. Boo!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Came here for lunch and the service was great. Sat along the window with a view of the golf course. 

The prices were not bad at all and definitely recommend this restaurant. The burger was cooked to perfection. The chips and salsa/guac were also amazing!"}
