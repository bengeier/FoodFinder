{"text":"Was in with my family tonight service sucked food was bad I never had ordered a plate of nachos taste so salty no meat nothing for 7.99 rip off fries were grease as heck made my stomach turn had to flag down a different server just to get refills on our drinks I wish the original owners never left Place stinks waste 65.00 never never will i return to cleats !!!!!"}
{"text":"Today, I went for a fish fry hoping to like Cleats again.  Their menu stated 3 beer battered fish, fries, s d coleslaw for over $10.  Sounded plenty until dinner arrived - 3 very small chunks of fish with bottom of the bag micro-fries and small shot of slaw.  Why does Cleats continuously try to disappoint its customers?  I was once a regular and now I'm a few-and-far-betweener who is consistently disappointed by Strongsville Management.  PS- even their beer choices have been cut to mainly big brewery (larger profit margin).  Come on Cleats!  You CAN do better!!"}
{"text":"Terrible just terrible. Went for lunch today, paid over $12 for a fish sandwhice and fries. Fish was soggy and stinky, fries must have been from 8 weeks ago. Never again!!!! Yukky-Poo"}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss the shot of tequila I had was over poured and watered down. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but very slow and inattentive. I ordered the fish dinner and I would have asked for lemon wedges but waitress didn't come over for about 20 minutes. The waitress only had one other table besides us so can't claim she was too busy. Fish was not tasty and fries had no taste at all. First time there is the last"}
{"text":"The main bartender (brunette, taller) works her butt off! We like to ride our motorcycles up here for a quick bite and a beer. Service is always good, never had a problem. The bartender deserves an assistant though for how hard she works. 

Sandwiches are huge portions and great for the price. 

One of the few times we've been here, some mozz sticks came out and they were a little well done. I mean I'm not picky so I still would have eaten them (other people probably wouldn't have) but she immediately looked at them and was like you need a better order than that. That's a good bartender and potential manager to make sure the customer is satisfied, before they even have a chance to be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Pretty average place... nothing unique about it... never been impressed... never been offended.

I work in the area and Cleats is a perfect \"beer after work\" place in my opinion.  Great place to stop in for a Bud Light or two on your way home... have some drinks with a co-worker... bitch about your boss.  Stuff like that.

Not somewhere I'd bring a date or go out for a \"night on the town,\" but not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"I just want to add to my previous review.  The atmosphere and warmth of the establishment is outstanding.  It all starts and ends with Cindy who does everything.  How could there be a more hard-working and friendly person on planet Earth?  Should I mention the wings again?  I live in Chicago, but every time I return to Ohio, I have to stop here!  The bar feels like home for this stranger...I like this place.  Pay Cindy more money!"}
{"text":"Good solid food. Visiting Strongsville on business my client took me to lunch that was awesome. On Thursday they have a $10.95 rib special that is awesome and rivals a full slab of any rib place easily at half the price. Make a Thurs run, I highly recommend it. Some cool old dude named Bill said to ask for the special six spice rub that they normally use on their wings to make them perfect. Will try that next time."}
{"text":"Cleats used to be my favorite bar/eatery in the entire world, until last year. 

I went in there twice a week with friends and family, but the past four times I went in, the service was extremely terrible. Yes, I went four times because I am addicted to their reubens, but not even the worst reuben craving will bring me back. 

One server, who I was stuck with twice, took such great care of his friends and chatted with them so long-ON BOTH OCCASIONS- drinks at my table were empty, and he was also unpleasant. 

Even when I sit at the bar, my service is horrendous. 

The food is always great and they give you so much, but service is a very important part in dining out, so I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night to try the hot and spicy burger. Was promptly served by quite possibly the kindest barmaid in Strongsville, Amy. 

I ordered the burger medium well with a side of coleslaw. The platter came out quickly and was delicious!   Burger was exactly as I asked, just a bit pink. It had an ample amount of hot giardiniera peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, 2 onion rings, and some tasty secret sauce with cheese. The pepper mix was outstanding and typically something I can only get in Chicago on Italian Beef. The  bun was nicely toasted, but nothing special. 

One of the side options was apple fries. I didn't have the guts to try them with a hot and spicy burger, but after the aforementioned feast, I decided to give it a go. Great choice for desert!  Slices of apple, battered and deep fried, then drizzled with caramel and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Wow!

The place needs a bit of TLC. The furniture and fixtures are left over from the previous establishment which takes some of the thrill out of a new place. They also have black boards for draft beers and Monthly Features, both of which have nothing written on them. On a positive note, the service is fast and friendly. And, the new menu looks outstanding. 

Overall, the place should get 4 stars. But since their overall rating reflects the prior poorly performing business, I gave it 5 to compensate."}
{"text":"This place seems to be very hit or miss on their food quality.

I've had some incredibly delicious wings here, and other times they are rubbery or not sauced very well.  Fries are average and most other dishes I've had also fall on the average range.

But, this restaurant / bar is a great place to view sporting events as they have a TON of TVs that can be seen from any angle in the place. Nice selection of beers, too."}
{"text":"My #1 Choice for Chicken Wings!  The Garlic Parm and Erie Island Smoke are Perfection!"}
{"text":"I came to this Cleat's location with my wife before a movie the other night. We weren't expecting much considering it was a bar with some booths scattered around it. Our last experience came at the Cleat's location in Parma Heights, and quite frankly it was a joke. 

We walked in and noticed the setup was completely different to the other Cleat's we had been to. The atmosphere was very warm and nice. They had some type of trivia game going when we got there, so we had some fun trying to figure out the answers.

The food was very good. We ordered the nacho tower, and it was a heaping plate of nachos with loads of cheese. I was impressed with how much you got for the price. Had to add chicken for 2 bucks though. The rest of our food was good as well. My burger was cooked just right and tasted great. My wife got the buffalo Mac n cheese and enjoyed it.
 
A very good experience overall. We know this is the Cleat's we will be going to from now on."}
{"text":"Once the go to wing place in Cleveland, but alas, no more. It was about 2 years since my last biz trip to Cleveland and Cleats, so I needed to get another dose of the best wings in town...fried crisp and seasoned perfectly. What I got this time was soggy, rubbery skinned wings floating in some sort of seasoned butter soup. Practically inedible. Then I pulled up recent Yelp reviews to find reports of similar experiences. In the words of my English friend \"I shan't be going back\"."}
{"text":"Was just at Cleats for the Cav's playoff game.  Not sure if they are under new ownership/management but service/food quality are not the same...something has changed.  Have been coming here for years and was very disappointed with the food and service.  Two of our party ordered wings.  One set had hot wings on top and ice cold wings below (seemed as though they were pulled out of the refrigerator).  Other set of dry rub wings were small and very salty  They had sliders on the menu.  The \"slider\" was identical to a dollar menu McDonald's hamburger for over 3 dollars for just one. Sliders usually come 2 or 3 per order.  Ordered a porter....not a tall...just a regular draft...and it was 7 dollars .  Beers used to be reasonable at Cleats. One of our beers ended up on our friend's bill. Our table was never cleared of empty glasses or plates/food the entire time we were there. They were definitely understaffed (for a Cav's playoff game)....wasn't that crowded. Also, ordered a Sante Fe Salad to go.  $9 and no chicken in the salad!   What happened to the Cleats that always had the best food/service at reasonable prices?  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Years ago I swore off Cleats because the food and service went downhill over the course of many visits. The worst part of all is they got rid of their hand cut fries and replaced them with frozen garbage. With that being said, last night we were in a hurry and in the neighborhood and we decided to give Cleats another chance. The food was average...I opted for some wings and requested them extra crispy to which they obliged. They were cooked well but could have used a little more sauce. My wife had the new house breaded chicken tenders and was pleased but the biggest surprise was that the hand cut fries have been resurrected. My only gripe was that they nickel and dime you for blue cheese, celery, and extra dipping sauce for the tenders. Our bill came to $48 with tip for 2 soft drinks, wings, chicken tenders platter, and a cup of steamed veggies for the baby. Long story short, the food was ok but not for $48. With so many other better options around I don't see us rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best part is they have tons of TVs with spots on. Service was friendly. Parking is easy. 

Everything else is blah. A boring strip mall bar with zero personality. Food is boring -- ordered chicken strips with sides and got four previously frozen strips and frozen broccoli. Beer selection is weak. 

Don't bother going here unless all you want is an average beer and to watch sports."}
{"text":"I guess I'll go back on a Tue-Wed for wing night, but that's it. I'm not someone who enjoys giving bad reviews, but I have to say, if I had gone to a sh*thole diner by the bus station and was served the burger I got, I would still be disappointed. My kid got a mini burger for $3 and I kept thinking, how on earth can they justify charging me $5.50 more for my burger? They looked like the same damn thing. I smartly asked for medium well, but it still showed up pink inside and I could barely digest the thing and the greasy, fatty \"pepper\" bacon on top. I went here 2 years ago and thought it was awful. The only reason we gave it another try was we got $50 for $25 certificate. I'll go back to watch a game and enjoy the beer, but as for food? Stick to wings or salad, cause the kitchen is just awful. They don't care. Within 100 yards on either side you got Johnny Js and The Local. Go there for a meal. They care."}
{"text":"Decided to come with grandsons Hockey team for dinner this evening. Our group was rather large and cut some slack on the service due to the 60 or so folks that were here.

Even after cutting slack for the size of the party, the service literally sucked, big time. Food and drink took for ever and cold by the time we got our food. It took an hour for my wife to get her hamburger. The fries were hot, but the burger was cold. 

Will not return for anything!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at cleats. I went for the wings and if you order anything else you don't know what you are doing. They have so many flavors but I could only try four. Garlic parm, Tai chilli, honey mustard, and Erie island smoke. The wings are fried crispy and then sauced.i have been coming here everytime I come from out of town. The service was a little slow like others said but I was in no hurry and just sucked down some happy hour beers while I waited."}
{"text":"Yeah its a bar.  They have wings, but never under estimate the power of a good burger.  I'm guessing they don't freeze them before cooking.  I built my own, but my friend did the manners burger (sauce and extra bread, like Bob's big boy).  I had a bunch of options, but only three choices (pepper bacon, roasted red peppers,and pepper jack cheese).  The \"pepper\" burger was awesome, lots of grease.  The fries are fresh cut and do not look pretty like fast food places.  I had malted vinegar and  wasn't afraid to use it.  I have previously had the wings, they not bad, but did I mention the burger.  Worth a trip if you are close by, not if you're across town.  But they have more locations."}
{"text":"We are back at Cleats tonight.  Matthew was our server and he was excellent!  Always kept our glass full and brought us whatever we needed very quickly.  And he did it all with a smile.  Our wings were cooked to perfection.  Very enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"The food at Cleat's has gone downhill. Wings are like rubber and everything is greasy. The chilli had so much oil floating on top I thought they had a oil spill. Wish the Cleat's of old would return! 

Can not recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"I asked numerous times to lower the bass booming obscene language music,.but the manager never came over and never asked the Cooks to lower it. I will never go back. I'll just go to the steel yard where they care or even north royalton. Damn cooks were just F@#%ed up and nasty. 12-7-12 @ 6:45pm"}

{"text":"Harvest Saloon (formerly Cleats) is one of my go-to neighborhood bars, primarily out of convenience, and for one of the nicest bartenders you'll ever meet, Amy. I had a hard time scoring this place due to my own attachment to it, but honesty has to take precedence over bias. 

During my four years living in the area, Harvest Saloon saw a great decline when it was Cleats, but has recently been renamed, is now under new ownership, andI I can only assume they're looking to make a resurgence to compete with the other local bar down the block in essentially the same strip mall. This will be no easy task, but I'm rooting for them!

The new ownership faces the basic chicken or the egg conundrum. Should they gut the place and completely redecorate? Should they offer more drink specials to bring in the crowds? Live music? Game night? Karaoke? Unfortunately, I don't have those answers either. What I can suggest, however, is that they find an identity. 

Here's what I mean: The domestic beers are just as cold as the domestic beers down the street. The liquor behind the bar is the same as well. So what's different? Identity. Define what sets this place apart from the other guy's. This hasn't been done yet. When you're in a competitive business, such as a bar or restaurant, having an identity is key. 

For now, Harvest Saloon is just a bar. They've changed the menu, which is a start, but it's still lacking refinement and an identity. Unless this changes in the near future, I'm afraid it won't last very long. I'll keep going as it's convenient and I root for the underdog, but as it stands right now, I couldn't recommend Harvest Saloon to anyone else."}

{"text":"After waiting too long on hold to order take out from Brew Kettle (their wings - amazing), I got pissed off and decided to give Cleats a try instead. We did the $20 sampler - 20 wings with 4 different sauces. The wings were okay. My kids liked the Kentucky Bourbon. The Jerk dry rub was kind of weird. Lots of rosemary, which I've never thought of as a standard 'Jerk' seasoning ingredient, but they were tasty. The Lake Erie Smoke dry rub wings were pretty good. Garlic Parm - eh - not so impressed. I asked over the phone if the tropical fruit medley side was fresh fruit. The staff person told me yes. That would be a 'nope'. I paid $4 for a pretty measly serving of gross canned fruit. Won't be doing that again. The fries were okay. I like mine crispy; these were not - but at least they were skin-on. The side of coleslaw was nothing special, probably plain old GFS or something. It was better than BW-3. But not by a ton."}
{"text":"Cleats is a typical sports with tons of tvs and a huge bar. I order boneless wings and tots, which were relatively decent but over cooked. I ordered 2 beers and to my surprise it was more expensive than the food. Cleats has a lot of specials (i.e. Burgers and brews on Monday, boneless wing and regular wings Tuesday and Wednesday, Rib night Thursday, and Fish Fry Friday). The bartender was so sweet and very attentive. A+ service! I would go again to drink but not for the food."}
{"text":"The wings here were decent, not the best but not the worst. Happy hour beer specials were 3$ for a 23 oz draft domestic and 2.50$ for a pint, so pretty good. Pretty much just your average sports bar."}

BTW:  Came back on Monday just to say hi to Cindy..."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place!!  Let me repeat that, I used to LOVE this place! But the food quality is hot or miss and takes forever to come out.  At my last and final visit, I had about 12-15 friends and family meet us up there while my son was leave from the Marines.The place was packed and the kitchen couldn't keep up.  To make matter worse the server asked if he could move our kids table to a smaller table (6 kids to a 4 person table) before their food came out so they could seat a party of 11? We refused BTW.  Food was already taking close to an hour to come out and they wanted to seat more people? 1/2 of the people in our party ended up taking their food to go, the other 1/2 received incorrect orders and cold wings.  Sadly, this wasn't the first time I had service like this here. I'm done!"}
{"text":"I moved out of town about a year ago and when I come back Cleat's is my first stop! They blow BDubs out of the water. Highly recommended place"}
{"text":"Living in Lima, I was beginning to think Buffalo Wild Wings was the best Ohio had to offer in the way of buffalo wings. Cleats changed all that.

Their six-pepper wings are a welcome departure from overly saucy wings. They're spiced in a dry rub with a bit of buttery goodness and allow you to taste Cleats' quality chicken.

The mild wings don't carry the overly sweet sauce most restaurants use to drown their chicken. Instead, it's a wonderfully tangy coating of magic.

The servers fall into two categories: hot and super-friendly. I saw some young ladies who outspiced my hot wings and met some older ladies whose kindness packed more buzz than the ice-cold Miller Lites I was pounding.

The restaurant itself is a bit darker than most Buffalo Wild Wings, and the clientele skews a bit older, so expect better behavior and a touch more family-friendliness.

My group did get off to a weird start when the hostess told us, \"We're really crazy tonight. I can seat you, but you can't order yet.\" That being said, our order didn't take long at all."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hr and best wings in town. I've never been a huge fan of dry rub but the Lake Erie smoke wings will blow your mind! Definitely a great spot after work for a beer or to watch the game."}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic (and filling) lunch here. My husband and I have visited Cleats in the past so expected the bar atmosphere. This was our first visit since the place changed name and ownership. I ordered a steak wrap and tater tots. Both were amazing. The horseradish on the wrap was powerful and so good! The tots were crispy on the outside and salted to perfection. I cannot wait to eat my leftovers.  My husband had Parmesan wings and said they were great. He also ordered their homemade chips with a bacon dip. Wow! Amazing! If you are looking for great bar food try this place. The country music was fun and they have a number of tv's with the latest sports playing. The price was right. We were waited on by whom I believe is the owner. Nice guy and top notch service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved Cleats for years. Went downhill and now it's seems on its way back up. Still have the best wings in town."}
{"text":"\"Cleat's - Home of the World's Best Wings\" Are they freaking joking?  Don't waste my time!

Cleat's boasts about its awesome wings and it's written on the front of every restaurant.  The even call their website www.cleatswings.com  
I figured, one of these days, I've got to try those wings, you know, since I'm a fan of good chicken wings.  And any restaurant that boasts the world's best wings surely can back it up, RIGHT?  WRONG!  WTF?

So the wife and I were in Strongsville and I punched up the nearest Cleat's on my Garmin Nuvii.  Sure enough, a Cleat's was conveniently located right around the corner from where we were.

Looking at Cleat's menu, I was impressed in that everything 'sounded' delicious.  But I didn't want anything but chicken wings because I've been thinking about them for months.  Cleats offers a wing sampler that comes with like 25 wings, five sauces or rubs, and fries or potato chips.  Yippee!, I thought.  I would be able to try many of the expectedly delicious sauces and rubs.  I figured at least one of the five sauces had to be yummy.  WRONG AGAIN!

We drank some delicous Dortmunder Gold, which they had on tap to our delight and watched a soccer game on a huge flat-screen TV while we waited for our grub.  Our server was very attentive and friendly.

Finally, the food arrived.  The wings looked really good even though I immediately noticed they weren't dripping with sauce the way I like.  The huge stack of fries in the center of the platter caught my eye!  The fries were yummy, not great, but decent.  They were home made with part of the potato skin left on and they were flimsy and greasy.  I prefer my fries big, tasty and not completely greasy.

Without further adieu, the wings were a total disappointment!  They were small and kind of dry.  They were not big or plump, as expected.  The sauces tasted bad except for the honey mustard.  Yes.  I said it.  I didn't like four of the five sauces I tried.  The sauces we tried were the Lake Erie Dry Rub, Cajun Dry Rub, Mild Barbecue, Honey Mustard and Teriyaki.  Did I say I was disappointed?  Totally.  My wife was not impressed either.

The honey mustard was actually decent, but the wings weren't very big, which sucked.  I would've thought the honey mustard was good, but since the wings themselves were crappy in size and texture...  
None of the sauces were great.  Both of the dry rubs were spicy, but that was all.  They didn't have any real flavor behind them and they tasted the same rofl.  The Teriyaki was probably the next worst followed by the mild barbecue, which wasn't half bad.  The most important characteristics of a good chicken wing to me is SIZE, quantity of sauce, flavor of sauce, moisture level of the meat and skin, tenderness of the meat, and heat.

Based on this dining experience, I do not recommend these wings AT ALL.  I have yet to try the other dishes on the menu and they did 'sound' delicious.  I hope to return to try the other items, but I definitely will not waste my time on wings.  If I want wings, I'm going to Quaker Stake & Lube or Blue Moose.  These other restaurants have excellent wings by my standards.

If we try Cleat's again, it will be the newly-opened Parma Heights location instead of the Strongsville location.  

If Cleat's is going to maintain its stance on \"Home of the World's Best Wings\", they need to go back to the drawing board and find a new chicken supplier and a new sauce magician.  Otherwise, I'm going to look at the sign scratching my head as I drive by on my way to a real chicken wing establishment.

Issue #1 was that his chicken tenders were not included. Issue #2 was the atrocity that is my \"6 boneless wings\" (photo included) what in the actual hell are those supposed to be?!"}
{"text":"Everytime I give this place a chance, I regret it.  If your just going for drinks and to catch a game, this place is sufficient.  However, I constantly have issues with the food.

Not only do they go through cooks left and right (which explains why my food is never prepped as on the menu), but every time I stop in there is a new manger as well.

At my most recent visit, I got the steak tacos and the steak was so gross I could not even bite through it.  Then, the manager would not even come over to apologize! I will not continue to give this place my business."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been Cleats regulars for over 8 yrs.  We are usually there once/week or every other week, mostly on Tues/Wed nights for the discounted apps.  The bar staffers are always friendly, and the food portions are large and well-priced.  Most of the wait staff are pretty good except one. Not sure if name is Kim or Amy, but sometimes she has a bit of attitude.  
Last night there were 8 of us and Kendra was excellent.  We had large vareity of apps and a couple sandwiches and all were good.  the homemade fries and chip boats (99 cents) go well with the jalepeno-dusted fried ravioli and the wings.  
Lately I've been getting the bonelsee/sinless wings (a sliced up chkn breast on bed of letttuce and sauce on the side) since lower cal and more meat quantity than traditional wings.  Sweet heat BBQ sauce has good lfavor and a nice zing.
There's a great roast beef parmesian sandwhich too, and the burgerts and chkn sandwiches are huge. The BBQ ribs are usually always tender, but can sometimes be hit-or-miss.
They carry Great Lakes beer brands besides the usual generic bar beers.
A previous post review in '10 had a laundry list of complaints, but I think they were overly sensitive or looking for a white-linen 5-star experience at a sports bar.  Not liking 4/5 sauces sounds like a personal issue.  Dry rubs are going to be more salty then wet sauces!
The newer Parma Hts store has been a disappointment the 2-3x I've beeen there (not same specials, had chintzy wings, slower bar service, etc)"}
