{"text":"This has the potential to be one of the better buffet options in North/West Mississauga, there aren't a tonne tbh.  Anyways, the take-out menu is simple and quite cheap. The food isn't spicy at all and it seems fresh. The taste is a bit bland but I prefer that to really spicy so it's about preference....I personally enjoyed their kebabs and fish though the wrap didn't have much taste.  The prices seem fairly standard to comparable buffets especially the weekday lunch ($11 seems pretty good) and at least that includes desert. The variety is nowhere near what they say is on the website though.  The problem and the reason I said potential is that this restaurant's owner isn't doing a good job of running things smoothly. Certain plates for example are empty and others are barely left so he needs to do a better job of having the food ready and there have also been complaints about the service. If this gets sorted out then it can be a really good buffet, the ambiance is quite nice.  Most of the dishes seem to be Mediterranean/Arabic.  Update: This place has some serious problems with their buffet at night and the items just not being fresh plus being bland plus lacking variety. The owner speaks a lot but doesn't really listen to suggestions and I hope they succeed because it does have potential but they need to step it up, waiters are nice at least."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST place in Mississauga you can ever go to eat. I'm saying this honestly to whoevers reading this for your health I suggest you don't go here. It was unbareable, my family and I will never be coming back and will try to warn as many people as we can. For one thing the manager is one of the most rude uncomfortable people you will ever meet he always creeps up at your table, and trys to talk to you while having your meal and just watching you it was most uncomfortable. There is HAIR in the food. I found a hair and told the manager and he just kept saying sorry while laughing and took the hair out and expected me to keep eating it? The workers were going over the buffet and eating the food WHILE THEY WERE WORKING. Looking around thinking that they wouldnt get noticed... the food is COLD. It is suppose to be \"fresh and tasty\" it is most deffinitly not fresh, it tasted like it could've been from days ago, The servers look lost, they take so long to come to your table for drink orders and all the tables around us stayed dirty for quite some time. It was a huge dissapointment. The food they advertise online and on the menu is non existent, The dessert looked like some cheap costco stuff. If I can save even one person from coming here then I'll feel like writing this review was needed. It's only a matter of time before a health inspector comes to check out this place and they are done, or it gets shut down or something. very sad. (im sure all the good reviews are the manager himself writing them)"}
{"text":"I came here with very low expectations and a voucher from Wagjag.  I will say that there has been tons of negative reviews for this place and I was really disappointed to see them (especially after buying the wagjag!).  From my lunch experience, I would say it's marginally improved from the negative reviews but certainly leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Is it worth the wagjag deal of 2 lunch buffet for $13?  Sure... is it worth the full price of $15 pp? NO WAY.  I'll start out by saying the decor and environment leaves much to be desired.  It feels like they just slapped up some walls and paint and called it a day.  It's probably the most spartan looking restaurant I've seen in a long time.  The space layout is not great and I was very surprised on how small the buffet actually was.  On the website, it sounds huge and filled with great things... reality says 'not so'.  When we arrived, a fair number of people were coming in to fill out take out trays.  It was clear that there is a big preference for the chicken kabob.  That was out quickly and wasn't replenished while we were there.  The salad bar was fresh but not plentiful in selection.  If they count pearl onions as an item, that's pretty sad but it looks like they do to get their numbers.  Nothing was horrible tasting at the salad bar but nothing stood out either.  At least nothing was wilted or moving.  As for the bread area and soup... holy cow, dismal. It was really really sad looking. I'm not sure if it was fresh or not but they had like 3 or 4 sad looking bread in each container area.    As for the hot area, this wasn't so bad.  Don't get the fish... it's pretty subpar.  Battered then left in the tray to steam... as you can imagine, chewy in a bad way.  The chicken kabob wasn't bad.  They used a combination of breast and leg meat.  It wasn't dry but not flavourful either.  It wasn't offensive.  The lemon pepper chicken in a stew fared much better.  Decent flavouring and moist but watch out for the bones!  The roasted vegetables were better than the steamed vegetables.  Better flavours and they weren't left to steam on their own.  The chick peas was half decent ... nothing exciting.    I was very surprised on the lack of desserts.  There was only half a tray of each item and there was maybe only 8 items at most.  Cantaloupe, watermelon, baklava (flavourless and stale), ma'amoul (dry), naamoura (fake tasting brick), kadaif (semi ok), jello (lol), macaroon (stale), and ice cream.  Definitely not worth it.  I will say there's one good thing about this place... service.  The people here cleared the plates quickly.  Though they may seem timid, they were always pleasant and honestly trying hard.  They were young adults and just trying to help.  I can't fault them there.    So is it worth it to come here?  For the wagjag deal, 7 pp isn't so bad but unless there is a huge change in the food selection or quality, I think this restaurant may not make it."}
