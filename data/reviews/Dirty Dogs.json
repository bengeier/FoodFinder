{"text":"Très bonne Poutine! Même à 2h du matin ! Je me suis régalé et le mec était super sympa et rapide"}
{"text":"If you think that you are there for the food: hot dogs are alright but a bit pricey. But if you care about your whole experience the manager is the worst manager I have ever seen. He is too arrogant and his only relevant customers are the ones that he is interested in. If he didn't have cooks with him, he couldn't have taken the orders.. It's good to stop by if you are hungry and around besides that it is not worth to go there"}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour for the hot dog. Should have read the reviews first. The hot dog tasted okay, there wasn't anything exceptional about I, probably wouldn't come again. Only one guy working there, cooking slowly and taking money in between."}
{"text":"Le concept est vraiment beau, mais pour le gout ça reste a discuter, la saucisse n'est pas bonne du tout, un hotdog normal aurai ete mieux, par contre le mac n cheese est tres bon, j'y retourne bientôt pour essayer leur poutine.   Prix abordable, peu de place pour s'assoir."}
{"text":"Rude staff, mediocre food.  If you want to be treated like you're not cool enough to be served by a grease-jockey and pay for an overpriced sausage on a bun, then look no further."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I'm all about glamorizing street food, hiring hipster waiters to serve it and charging $10+ for it. While the menu is interesting...  My vegetarian hotdog was cooked on the same grill as regular meat dogs. The restaurant is poorly ventilated, so while you wait in line (20+ minutes for my hotdog with there people in front of me), your hair and clothes soak in the pervasive smell of the grease. And I don't understand why the waitstaff cannot put more than three hotdogs at a time to cook on the giant grill."}
{"text":"Fun joint with super staff!! Food is greasy as it should be. Fries are amazing as are the hot dogs.. lots of fun! But you might be standing if it's busy."}
{"text":"The food here is extremely unique and was definitely worth a visit. My wife should have split a plate in retrospect as the helpings are huge. The service was lacking, but the unique food and fun atmosphere overcame that. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The menu is interesting but slightly too expensive . When i went, I've ordered first and they served two person that ordered after me, BEFORE ME, while we had the same order. By the time they finished my order the hotdog was cold and it tasted bad. 25$ down the drain for cold mac'n'cheese hotdog that had a gross texture.  I don't think i'll be going back. Ill make it at home instead. Sorry dirty dogs."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful. They had excellent vegetarian poutine and a nice choice of beers. The guy (unasked) moved the umbrella so I was in the shade. The gal gave lots of cool recommendations for us tourists."}
{"text":"Went in on Monday, and Levi & Dave took their Dirty Dog hot dogs to a whole new level.  Not only are they far superior in terms of quality and variety (from chilli to foie gras on a dog), the staff is exceptionally fun.  If you're a fan of the classic Michigan dog, their \"Bruce Springstein\" is the Michigan dog on steroids.  This restaurant is a must, and I rarely ever say that."}
{"text":"I'll make this quick!  I ordered the Gandolfini an it was very good! Only thing I didn't like were the thick pieces of bacon on top which were very hard to chew.  The reason I'm taking away two stars is because the kitchen area was in need of some tlc... The floors were disgusting and the hood along with every other piece of equipment was dirty.   On top of that, the hood was definitely turned off; you could see the smoke from the grill and fryer going everywhere but upwards.  I'll be back but i'll wait for my order outside to save myself from smelling like a fryer!"}
{"text":"This is the worst case of \"you used to be cool\" I've e we seen happen in under 2 years. The place is just bad now. And this after trying to like the new thing a few times"}
{"text":"This joint is pretty average and so is their food .    There is maybe around 6-7 choices of hot dogs and this definitely cannot satisfy everyone's taste --restaurant should consider doing custom orders.  Anywho , my Morgan freeman tasted good but the overall experience was average and at that price (close to 10$) I was expecting a lot better . For example , the restaurant could have given us a fries or a drink through such an expensive order . Come the heck on it's a hot dog , will you seriously charge me 10$ ? Even Japadog in Vancouver makes better hot dogs in term of taste and friendly prices .  Service was courteous , but cooking these took a while , walking in such a joint makes you think you can get out with your food in 10 mins but it is certainly not the case as it took close to 20 mins .  Anyway , if you really crave for a hot dog on mont royal you can definitely come to this joint , it's an experience nonetheless. However , note that they are not great and are certainly overpriced . You can definitely get better and more of them at Julep or Decarie hot dogs if you are willing to make the Trip"}
{"text":"The real deal! Keep on the good Work excellents dog's!! And kevin the best chef ever!"}
{"text":"First time I was there was amazing. Had to wait for my sausage to cook, it took a good 15-20min but it was totally worth it. Soft, juicy and delicious, incredible. BEST HOT DOG I EVER HAD. Truly gourmet.  Second time was the complete opposite. it took 5min to get my hotdog, they just re-heated a sausage they had lying around! Sausage was chewy hard and tepid.  Same for fries, felt they had been sitting there all day, un-eatable, threw away 80% of them.   Maybe too many people complained about having to wait too long, or they juts got bored, or they just do not care anymore. Can't tell for sure, but this is not gourmet food, it is fast food of the worst kind.  I believe consistency is the hallmark of quality hence 2 stars.  STICK TO ORIGINAL PLAN! gourmet, not fast food!"}
{"text":"I came here for the poutine week. Best idea ever! Tried their famous Mac and cheese poutine and was floored. Amazingness. Good for a fun date and fun time. Plus their 90s music playlist topped it off"}
{"text":"Hotdogs were good. Staff was really friendly. Kinda pricey...$34 for two people.  Poutine was good minus the mustard...sorry but mustard does not belong on a poutine."}
{"text":"Decided to try out that new restaurant on the block. First and last time for me. Ordered the Bazooka: sausage ($15) served  in a big bun with bacon chips, and a HUGE serving of fries. Paradise for carb lovers. Ate a few fries and the sausage, left out the huge bun and  practically a whole plate of fries, which were good. Way too many carbs. Should have ordered a small salad to balance off the heavy fries. Not a satisfying meal at all:  $20.13 with a drink and taxes. Left hungrier than before. Hard to figure out why that place is so popular."}
{"text":"Where do you take a toddler celebrating his 2nd birthday, when he LOVES all things hot dog and sausage?  Dirty dogs of course!  The menu seemed overwhelming at first: pages and pages of choices!  But once the friendly waiter explained that it basically boiled down to: pick what you want to eat (hotdog, burger, poutine), pick you specific (ie beef vs pork sausage) and THEN pick toppings.  Or flip it around and pick your toppings first.  There's strategy involved, for sure, but not difficult.   Once we ordered the food came out pretty quickly.  I'm sure it helped that it was pretty early and wasn't very busy yet.  Everything was delicious.  The only real downside is we went on a super hot and sunny day.  The windows were open, but it was super duper hot.  There were seats in the sunny open window we initially sat in, but quickly moved because the heat was just unbearable.  So next time around we'll pick a milder day."}
{"text":"The food and prices are out of this world. I love the diner cool and laid back vibe of this restaurant. They have killer poutine and in many different varieties. Is poutine not your style then indulge in a hot dog or hamburger.   This is the ultimate diner bad food but in the best way possible. The wait staff are super nice and friendly. I love the seating you don't have to wait forever to get a place even at there busy hours.   Accepts debit, credit and cash."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food and prices ! My friend and I went to go check out this place. When we went in we found a cool diner feel. We sat at the bar as it was a bit busy. Probably being it was Saturday night. But a great choice as I love the bar.   We ordered two green beers for St. Patty's Day also the Poutine topped with Mac and Cheese and also the Poutine topped with Philly Cheese Steak. The service was fast even though it was busy the food came out in under 20 minutes.   The fellow behind the bar was very great at making sure we were good and topping of our water constantly.   If you are a Poutine lover I'd suggest you check it out as they have a big selection of dishes. Something for everyone and also salads, burgers and hot dogs !!! Family friendly, close to the transit and parking on the street !   The prices are also amazing and I'm impressed by the venue and also prices on the menu !"}
{"text":"The dogs were great, especially the homemade pork sausage and the buns. I had the Mac and I thought it was a bit dry for my liking. I would've liked more \"oozing\". That being said, the place is so small that we could hear someone who worked there loudly sharing their life morals to the table next to us. It lasted the entire time we were there and straight up ruined the experience for us."}
{"text":"By far this place makes the best hot dogs I ever had. I'm not a big fan of their fries (and never understood all the hype of the duck fat fries that they sell) but their hot dogs are simply amazing.   My only complaint is that there is a certain inconsistency. One time while craving their hot dogs biked there from a relatively far location and arrived at dirty dogs almost two hours before their closing time just to be greeted by the staff that apologized saying that they ran out of ingredients and would no longer be serving that day. Something very similar happened while ordering through just-eat in another occasion. Delivery is not always available and you have to try your luck.   But again... They make the best hot dogs I ever had. Do yourself a favour and order their Mac and cheese hot dog."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  The staff was super cool and friendly and the food was delicious.  Portions were generous.  Poutine was some of the best I've had!  The dogs themselves were fantastic.  My husband and I live in New York and we were told they will be franchising here in the US soon.  Here's hoping they come to New York!!"}
{"text":"Great toppings, decent fries and lousy sausage sums it up in seven words."}
{"text":"This place was really great. We had heard good things and since I had never had true poutine before, we wanted to check it out. The menu can be a bit confusing, but we eventually figured it out. I got the Dirty Sanchez Dog with the traditional poutine. The curds were great and the gravy was spiced just right. My husband got the cheesesteak poutine and I must say, that was out of this world. Would definitely order that if we go back. Not too expensive either and they serve pretty decent beer and wine too."}

{"text":"I came here after a night out at bars, and had to order the Mac Attack on a poutine since it was highly spoken of. I ordered a small and still couldn't finish it. It was really good! Bacon and mac n cheese on a poutine?! It doesn't sound appetizing but it was great! My boyfriend ordered the same thing but on a pork sausage instead of poutine. He said that was great as well! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hot-dog gourmet, vous dites? Quel délice! Peut-être pas bon pour le bedon, mais en tout cas, au goût, c'était super. Chez Dirty dogs, vous aurez droit à des hot-dogs comme vous n'en avez jamais vu : les saucisses sont savoureuses, et les garnitures excellentes (mac and cheese, porc effiloché, etc.). Le menu donne vraiment l'eau à la bouche.   L'endroit est assez étroit, mais s'il fait beau, prenez pour emporter et aller manger votre festin dans le parc.  Côté service, malgré le petit incident qui m'est arrivé, c'est impec. Les employés avaient perdu ma commande et le gérant (en tout cas, je crois qu'il s'agissait du gérant), sans que je lui demande quoi, a pris l'initiative de m'offrir ma commande gratuitement. Même si j'ai d'abord trouvé que Dirty Dogs manquait d'organisation, j'ai vu que les employés avaient vraiment à cur leur clientèle. C'est ce qu'on aime, non?  J'y retournerai assurément pour goûter autre chose cet été. Des hot-dogs de luxe, quelle bonne idée!"}
{"text":"Mon expérience se restreint aux plats à emporter! Le service est ultra rapide et les serveurs sont agréables! La salle est grande et claire....et offre des vidéos sur grands écrans un peu spéciales..... Je recommande la Dirty Sanchez qui est délicieuse!"}
{"text":"Great place!!  The best part surprisingly is the buns!! Its easy the best hotdog in the city without just being a salt fest. Its really good quality sausages instead of generic Weiner's from the provigo.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour la semaine de la poutine. L'endroit est petit, il faut arriver tôt.  La poutine Mac n' Cheese surprend par ses ingrédients, un mélange de frites, fromage en grain et macaroni au fromage. Pourtant le mariage est heureux. Les pâtes sont cuites à point, la sauce aux 4 fromages est crémeuse, onctueuse, les frites restent croustillantes, pas ramollies du tout. L'ajout du bacon enrobe le goût du mac en lui donnant un goût salé   Un beau coup de coeur.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Walked in and there were like 4 people in the bar.  Bartender was struggling to make what looked like Sangria.  Acknowledged me and went back to making her drink.  I ended up walking out after about 10 minutes with no beer.  I really wanted a hot dog!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese Poutine was great !!! The milkshake was fantastic ^^ j'y retournerai c'est sûr!!!!  So one year later, I went back again and this time Mac and cheese poutine wasn't good at all !!!! Such a big difference with the first time. Hotdog was stilll good but I highly recommand the beef sausage instead of the porc one ...."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far; Once with my cousin and once alone since I live so close.  The food is awesome and does not disappoint! I've had \"The mac attack\" and I've had \"The bacon bazooka\". As a person who isn't the biggest fan of hot dogs, I was really surprised at how much I loved it!  The staff is friendly but can get sometimes distracted by their friends hanging out at their bar. I remember being a young waiter with only fun on his mind...so it didn't bother me.  Ill definitely be back again and again for those delicious gourmet hot dogs!!!"}
{"text":"Dog: we had the boss, with the housemade pork sausage, root beer chili, a little bit of cheese, mustard, and a sweet kraut. It was delicious, as the dog wasn't too densely packed and even amidst all the toppings you could still taste the link. Good snap, too.  Poutine: it just fine. The fries and the gravy were a bit colder than I would have liked, but that's perhaps because we came at 4pm and they were running on old batches. the gravy had the right consistency and taste however, not too liquid (poutine isn't a soup). The cheese was fresh, so that's also a plus.  It's normally pretty hard to find good hotdogs, especially ones that not only put in good toppings but also good dog itself. This is a solid dog, nothing more, nothing less. I'd definitely return if in the area.  Note: American friends, these are steamies. Bun is steamed, not toasted (NE) or room temperature. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"BEST place to get some vegetarian poutine in Montreal in my opinion. They have a ridiculous amount of vegetarian options compared to other places.  The poutines themselves are perfect amount of cheese and gravy in fries. I fell in love. They give a huge portion all for under 10$. I got one by myself but I definately recommend sharing next time.   The service was quick, we got our food in less than 10 minutes. The server that helped us was also very nice in helping us pick an option.   Definately will return next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this another try in its new location after having a less than acceptable time at the old location. I walked in with a friend and stood in front of the \"please wait to be seated sign\". After it was very clear that no one was coming to seat  us we started to walk around looking for anyone at all. We arrived at the bar and someone finally noticed we were there. We were quickly seated and had our order taken in a way that made it seem like we had interrupted the waitor's favourite show. When the food arrived it was nearly tossed into the table. My friends poutine was searved in a heaping portion in his bowl. My bowl was a little over half full. What we had tasted fine but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I apologized to my friend for taking him there and we left immediately after paying."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is really really good. The burgers, hot dogs, fries... It's all delicious. The service, however, needs a ton of work.  The most recent time I was here my friend and I didn't receive our drinks until AFTER I had finished my food and our plates were cleared! I noticed a nearby table that was here before us hadn't even hadnt even had their order taken when I finished eating. Another time my friends order was simply forgotten entirely; not even \"put into the system\"! Again, I love the food. Maybe get it to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'd like to go more often but it's not really the type of food I can justify that often.   House made sausage by some cool guys who seem to love what they do. You can't go wrong.   The fries are a little dark/greasy/overfried for me, but that seems to be the trend in Montreal for some reason? I'm a douchey Vancouverite  so what do I know :P   It's a small place so don't expect to bring your whole family and have dinner for three hours.   Apparently they do late night delivery on the weekends which I have yet to utilize!"}
{"text":"Heard about the place and decided to give it a try.  I went for the Meat Tornado. Choice of beef or pork weiners. Sliced Philly steak, crispy bacon bits, a fried egg and their special sauce. Delectable.  They were just voted as having Montreal's best poutine, so I'm definitely coming back to try that.  They also have plans to start franchising, both here and in the US. So expect to see one near you in the future."}
{"text":"First time at this place. No one really greets you at the door and it took a few minutes before a waiter comes at the table. A little too expensive. My husband and I had burgers and the pig n mac poutine. The burgers are nothing special but the poutines are oh so good. The bbq sauce was really tasty and there was a hint of rosemary in the sauce. Overall i give it a 31/2 stars. This is a perfect place for a younger crowd after clubbing."}
{"text":"I crave these dogs all the time...especially the Bernie Mac...what's not to love mac and cheese on top of an amazing sausage and delicious bun.....yum  ...I want more!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan hot dogs! Vegetarian pouting! Open late on weekends! Service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Please put a sign in front of the restaurant stating that kids are not allowed. That would have prevented me from getting seated, checking the menu and getting kicked out. That would have also prevented your employee from having to do so to me and another family. When you are hungry, 15 lost minutes is an eternity. Will update the review once I try it again, but that is not a good first impression of the place."}
{"text":"I'd give this place anywhere from a 3.5 to a 4. When we got there the cashier took our order promptly, but we had to wait at least 15-20 minutes for our food. It seemed a little long for a hot dog. However, in their defence, the cook had a sh*tload of orders and he was by himself. He was working VERY hard in extreme heat.   I ordered the Bernie Mac. The sausage was delicious; full of savoury juicy flavour.  It was topped with crispy bacon, shallots and Mac n' cheese. I was disappointed with the Mac n' cheese topping. It was dry. I was expecting it to be more moist and saucy, but it wasn't. It was dried up macaroni on my sausage.   I can't remember what my friend order, but she's vegetarian and they were very accommodating to her.   Their poutine was wonderful. They season it with rosemary which adds a nice and original kick to the dish.  Although I was slightly disappointed with my dog, it was still delicious none the less. I could just imagine how epic it must be with fresh Mac n' cheese.   Worth the try."}
{"text":"Je revois ma critique à la baisse. D'un petit shop de cheums sympa et à l'arrache, le dirty dogs a succombé aux sirènes de la gentrification du quartier. C'est maintenant une place sans caractère et la qualité des hot dogs a bien baissé. Ça reste pas mal mais je n'y vais plus."}
{"text":"I went back to taste their mac and cheese hot dog and it did not disappoint. The beef sausage was flavourful and the mac and cheese was so good I wish I had gotten a portion of just that.  The staff was different since we went at night but they were still very friendly and got the food done quick. The place was kinda empty for a saturday night which is odd. But this isn't really the place to have a sit down dinner. It's really more for on the go."}
{"text":"I blame this one on my poor judgement. I should have picked a poutine, but instead got influenced by the restaurant's name and got a hot-dog (The Notorious P.I.G).   The hot-dog was good for sure, but it was just one single fancier than average dog - not really worth the price tag. The rest of the plate was a swarm of fries, so it got kind of boring after awhile. Also, they used a sweet pickle on my hot-dog. A SWEET pickle - my worst nightmare!!! (I'm kidding, it's not that bad, I just like sour ones better). My borfriend went for the Mac & Cheese poutine, which was much more interesting and yummy. The Oreo milkshake we shared was quite nice too. It was served in those retro snack bar metal cups, and made entirely with thick, heavy vanilla ice cream. Chef on Call used to make their milkshake like that too, but have since opted for a lighter version, with mostly liquid milk it seems :(  They had a lot of choices on their menu (porc, beef, vegetarian; hot-dog, burger, poutine) and the service was great. There's plenty of TV screens in Dirty Dogs, so it was possible to watch the ongoing hockey game from pretty up every seat.   Nice place, but kind of expensive.  Note: They have a very entertaining wall full of photos of celebrities (including Betty White lol) in the midst of eating hot dogs."}
{"text":"The food tastes the same as the other location. It's still excellent so instead I'll review the service.  I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was really empty even though we were there for 6pm ish. They were all very friendly! They explained the menu to is, not that we needed it but it was really appreciated. They also checked in with us a couple of times during the meal to see if we were ok.  Monday to Friday they have a special 5-7 deal where some poutines/burger/hot dogs are 10$ and some cocktails/beers are 5$. So we got 2 poutines and 2 drinks. They don't have regular ice tea on the menu but the server offered to make me a homemade one that didn't have any alcohol in it.   Service was also very fast, because they were empty I'm guessing, we ordered at 6:30 and for the food at 6:41. 11 minutes is not a long time to wait and the food was fresh and warm! I really like the way it is presented too, much more restaurant friendly.   I will say the the poutine mac and cheese is not as fun as the hot dog mac and cheese. I LOVE mac and cheese and the taste was just a bit lost with the poutine gravy. It still tasted good but I wish they had a mac and cheese option!! It's so good there. Next time I'll try the burger :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the angry goat burger and classic poutine. Food was good apart from the fact that the burger meat tasted like it wasn't very fresh. Probably would be better if it wasn't pre frozen (or tasted like that)! Also service wasn't the greatest as one of the employees wasn't too friendly. No one greeted us at the door so we weren't sure where to sit. Our personal server was great (Keelan). Probably would not return as it was not excellent and slightly overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"They call themselves gourmet hot dogs, I'm not so sure that's the right title. Yes, the toppings are interesting, I never had a mac and cheese hot dog before, but the final outcome is OK and nothing more. The first bite you take is great, you are realizing you are having mac and cheese on a hot dog! How awesome is that?  Then you realize that the bun is dry and that the quality of the meet is just ok, and even if it was great- It's really hard to notice under all that cheese, pasta and bacon flakes. Bottom line: Nice novelty, if you are drunk and in the area, you could give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork hotdog and poutine. The different tastes blended together is a great pleasure on your taste buds. Great place!"}
{"text":"Comment vous décrire l'expérience du Dirty Dogs..  Il est petit et si vous savez pas où chercher, probablement vous y passerez a coté sans le remarquer. Et beh, ça serait bien dommage car vous passeriez à côté du meilleur hot dog de la planète! Non, mais qu'est-ce que je dis, de la galaxie.. AU MOINS.  Un accueil sympa et chaleureux dans un endroit vraiment minuscule , deco sympa qui va parfaitement avec le style du lieu . Même la barbe du gérant est parfaitement à thème !  La liste des hot dogs met l'eau à la bouche tant que pour choisir j'ai du tirer au sort : impossible de faire un choix autrement !  Un boss, des frites, un Canada dry : mes artères se souviendront a jamais de cette expérience !  Tellement bon, mais tellement bon que les primes ne suffisent pas. Allez y en courant (mais surtout, courez APRÈS, histoire de brûler des calories..)!"}
{"text":"Place is friendly, service is good, food is ok but possibly i didn't order the right meal for me. It's definitely an upgrade of the regular hot dog and poutine diner. A little more expensive than i expected. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"We wanted a poutine. The poutine was good. Four staff members, fours groups of clients. All staff chatting with their friends or on their phones.   End of story: Poor service."}
{"text":"After a night out at Tokyo Bar, the group and I decided to go for Dirty Dogs and it was one of the best decisions we've ever made after having a good night.   We got there in couple of minutes and once we got there, we got our table and got the menus. Their menus are loaded with so many choices. However I decided to go for the Classic Poutine. The squad ordered mac and cheese and veggie dog. We waited for like 25 minutes for our order to get to our table as it was definitely the busiest time of the night where most people do want to have dirty dogs before they go home! It was also crowded.  At first bite of the Poutine, I was in heaven! Their foods are so good. The taste and consistency for the gravy alongside with the cheese curds were exceptional. I finished it within a glimpse of time.   Service was excellent, they make everything possible to end your night on a good note and with food. I'd definitely recommend it to others who want to try a \"Montreal Classic\"   Loved it and will return to try other foods on their huge menus now that they started doing pizzas too which is so exciting for foodies like us all :)"}
{"text":"Was told this place was a must try..so what the heck...lets give it a shot...  Place is small and seating is limited...so expect.to share a table.and rub elbows with your fellow men as you work on the messy hotdogs..  Always go with the pork.hotdog as it is house made and fresh....there is a beef option though...and a vegan one? ( pls not that one) lol...  Anyhow..wife ordered one with mac and cheese and bacon and i had \"Le Boss\".....which is essentially a pork hotdog with home made chilli made.with dr pepper ( yes, you read it right) ...oh yummy....  Complemented the meal with a poutine of course...lol.  Hotdogs were messy but oh so juicy and moist...no msg or nitrate taste...you can tell for sure...  Poutine was good too...it won a.contest in 2015..lol.   The only negative was the bread ..it was.bland and kinda stale...maybe heating it up wouldve been good or made it complement the hotdog well...hence the 4 stars....  You can also order a hotdog poutine...poutine with sliced pork hotdogs as extra topping.....  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"We went to try the Poutine Week special: popcorn chicken on a mac n cheese poutine! Drool. The service was veryyyy slow considering the place wasn't crazy busy... for my full review, click here: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/02/06/if-youre-in-montreal-feb-1-7-you-gotta-try-dirtydogs-poutine-for-lapoutineweek/"}
{"text":"yeah you know I got the so-cal and it was good and all but let's face the fact. It's a 9$ hot dog. It's the thing you buy once and never go back because a hot dog that is deli style costs anything from 3 to 5 $ in Montreal. So I doubt this place will stay open for ever pricing that way. Too bad because the food is decent. Bring it down to 5 or offer two for 10(because one will not satisfy your hunger) and you might have something that can keep going."}
{"text":"Great concept but check the hygiene! The guy preparing our order was nice and efficient, but he used the same unclean hands to take the money, clean the counter with a nasty rag, and make our dogs!! Seriously unappetizing!! Won't go back. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Went last night around 7:30 pm. The location was very easy to find. Went in and waited to be seated. The service was very slow. When we sat down at our table it was FULL of water and the waiters didn't wipe it for us, leaving us to wait for it to dry. The decor of the restaurant was very cute, but beware of \"snap chatters\" taking many snapchats with their flash on while you're trying to eat. The food was okay, ordered the Mac attack but it seemed like the burger just has noodles in it with no cheese sauce. The dirty sanchez poutine was very good. The portion sizes were very big, but 2 beers, 2 burgers and 2 poutines it ran us $80 including tax and tip which was way over priced for the food serve"}
{"text":"Allo la déception! Nous avons fait la rue complète pour trouver un restaurant pour nous et notre fils de 2 ans. Après avoir continué tout droit en passant devant un restaurant qui indiquait sur ses portes 18+ (un restaurant avec la bouffe à 5$) nous avons décidé d'arrêté au Dirty. Ayant déjà eu un avant-goût lors d'une foire, c'était l'occasion de pouvoir manger un peu plus et découvrir le menu. Nous avons été accueilli, installé et même fait donné nos verres d'eau et le menu pour que 15 minutes plus tard... La serveuse passe pour nous dire qu'on doit quitter à cause de notre fils de 2 ans et puisqu'ils ont la licence de bar. Une autre famille de 2 enfants ont quitté en même temps que nous. Donc, deux familles dans une restaurant totalement vide ont dû quitter par manque d'information sur le devant du restaurant. J'en reviens pas encore. C'est pas comme si j'allais dans une brasserie!"}
{"text":"My suspicion when I first came across this place was that it was severely overpriced for a hot dog (a food that should, by tradition be cheap & delicious). Finally decided to give it a shot today, and not only was it severely overpriced for the quality, but the hot dogs themselves were just plain bad. I got the K Pop and there was more kimchi than anything else on the hot dog, and you couldn't taste anything else. The person I went with got the Pig Mac (hot dog with Mac and cheese on it), and the Mac and cheese was honestly disgusting. It tasted like cardboard. I don't really understand how you could fuck up hot dogs this badly and then make people pay 3 times more for them, but there ya go."}
{"text":"Changement de décors et de carte depuis la dernière fois où j'étais venu ! Et je pense que le concept a mûri, les changements sont pour moi tous bénéfiques. Le lieu est bien plus accueillant qu'avant avec la possibilité de se poser dans un endroit plus propre et mieux agencé qu'avant. Déjà pour ca c'est un gros avantage, ca sent moins le gras et avec moins de fumé. Très apprécié !  Au niveau de la carte c'est plus simple avec moins de choix mais c'est aussi mieux maîtrisé ainsi ! Les frites sont maisons maintenant et ca se sent ! Une seule saucisse au porc, une au boeuf et une végé alors qu'avant il y avait trop de choix. Toutes maison et très bonnes. Nos 2 hotdogs était succulents :) De plus maintenant il y a de la poutine et en plus elle est très bonne ! J'étais sceptique lorsqu'ils ont gagné la poutineweek et bien mes soupçons se sont estompés après avoir goûté leur poutine. J'ai vraiment adoré. La grosse est conséquente. On avait un hotdog chacun et on se l'ai partagé et ça faisait pas mal à manger :)  Je trouve même que les prix ont baissé au niveau de l'addition par rapport à notre première visite !  En conclusion vraiment pas déçu d'être revenu faire un tour ici et on reviendra de sur pour regouter d'autres plats."}
{"text":"Fait que ma copine et moi nous sommes retrouvées chez Dirty Dogs pour dîner, après avoir vu une photo de leur décadente poutine sur les internets!  J'vais dire que mes attentes étaient quand mêmes élevées. Mais je vais donner mes étoiles selon chaque segment:  - le service... bof: 3 étoiles. Le gars qui nous a servi n'avait pas l'air plus enjoué qu'il fallait de travailler, nous étions obligées d'attirer son attention (quand le resto n'était pas si occupé et il n'était pas seul sur le plancher) Il a eu une étoile de plus vu que comme nous avions demandé de la salade au lieu des frites avec le hot dog et que nous avons reçu des frites.. il a laissé les frites et a amené une salade. J'apprécie le fait qu'il n'a pas juste dompé les frites aux poubelles.  - La poutine.. ok: 3 étoiles. Je suis vraiment difficile en matière de poutines. J'ai trouvé le mac n cheese dessus un peu fad. Mais elle était quand même cochonne et satisfaisante.  - Le dirty hot dog.. miam: 4 étoiles. Vraiment la saucisse était excellente et les garnitures amusantes en bouche. la salade, un tantinet ordinaire. Les frites étaient bonnes quant à elles.  - mention spéciale pour les taxes sur la facture: TPS - Fonds d'vacances Trudeau TVQ - Réparations d'nid d'poule  Haha!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best poutine in the region and unarguably the best hot dogs."}
{"text":"Service took WAY too long considering this is a glorified hot dog stand. We had mac n cheese dogs, the mac n cheese was short on the \"cheese\" to say the least. The hot dog itself fell apart within the first 2 bites. Poorly constructed. The poutines were about half the size of a small from belle province.   All in all, a mediocre snack for 2 people came out to $45 after tax and a 15% tip. Won't be back which is sad because hot dogs and poutines are a staple in my diet and I had been really excited to try. Staff was also f***ing rude."}
{"text":"I ordered the dirty Sanchez poutine which looks amazing. It was not cause it's topped with cheese sauce, the orange disgusting weird cheese flavoured liquid. Anyway when it got to my table I immediately told the waiter I did not want it and it didn't say it was topped with cheese sauce. He said it was but if you look at the menu it just says 4 cheese and no where does it mention a liquid weird orange cheese flavoured sauce. I though it would be like cheese curbs, with like shredded cheese of different kind. Anyway the waiter asked the manager who said he could only charge me 50% of it and I haven't even had a bite of it. And I could order something else, so basically I had to pay for half of it plus order something else. Anyway it costed me 30$ for one drink and one poutine that I haven't even eaten. Pretty disappointed. The hostess was really super nice."}
{"text":"Awesome burger. Very unique ideas for toppings. Le Oktoberfest was delicious. Our waiter was one of the nicest people we met in montreal."}
{"text":"It was definitely more than what i ever want to pay for lunch let alone a hot dog lunch but it was pretty good! (Meal pictured came up to 42cnd-had i known this, def would've picked stg different but apparently switching the regular fries for the poutine made the meal double the price.. sigh oh well) I asked for suggestions on stg spicy and cant remember the dish name but my beef hotdog came with the perfect amt of spice. I got a salad as a side and it was very fresh and the house made balsamic was great. Hubs enjoyed his dish as well. Overall recommend for the food but not for the price."}
{"text":"The Bernie Mac is the best dog I have ever eaten. I wasn't expecting much from this place but was pleasantly surprised. The staff is friendly and I found them to be quite personable. I was not a big fan of the POUTINE as it has onions which I do not like and it wasn't in the description.  It made the poutine a little too sweet and it did not have enough cheese. Other than that, it is an awesome hole in the wall style restaurant and I will be back for that Bernie Mac."}
{"text":"Felt like a Hot dog, now I promised myself to try everything on their menu.. It was amazing, the dogs are huge and delicious and the poutine one of the best I've had. Do yourself a favor and try the Maurice Richard, the foie gras just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff!!  The portions are very large. There is a $10 lunch special on the menu.  I had le Eastwood on the lunch menu. Very good.  Kids had the large poutine, we had to take half of it home.  Washrooms are nice and clean, and the decorations are eye catching. I spent a little bit more time in there than usual.  Very good. 4.5stars for food 4.5 stars for service"}
{"text":"I happened to pass by here with a friend of mine because she was starving. She got The Mac & Cheese. I didn't get anything. The hot dog was about $9-10 (pretty steep if you ask me) and the Mac & Cheese was reheated (not her favorite). Not to mention that the actual hot dog isn't a hot dog, it's a sausage. My girlfriend wasn't overly impressed with the hot dog. I'm not sure I would try one out."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a late night snack. I advise getting everything on your poutine!"}
{"text":"I tried Dirty Dogs a couple of years back when they finally opened or even before that when they were serving food out of local established Bar kitchens as a \"special event\". I loved it..thought it was phenomenal. Unfortunately I stopped in the Mont Royal location for the first time in about 2 years yesterday only to find that the quality and taste is no longer there like it once was. I had the \"Mac n Cheese\" which is the first dog I ever tried from them...the mac sauce is now clumpy and dry and the bun was not heated up and not moist in the least, tasted like it came straight from the fridge. The porc sausage does not taste like it used to, I found it to be tasteless..also got a side of poutine..the fries and curds are decent but the sauce has big pieces of herbs that have still not cooked down into the sauce, picking rosemary or thyme out of my teeth for 2 hours after I eat is not appealing. Long story short, I'll never eat there or recommend this place to anyone ever again, I guess a possible change in kitchen staff or management had happened.  Shame."}
{"text":"Saw all the pictures on Instagram and decided that I had to come here during my trip to Montreal. We arrived here pretty late at 10 pm (an hour before closing) so there was no line. We ordered a Mac n Cheese poutine along with a Mac n Cheese hot dog. The Mac n Cheese poutine was amazing, it was extremely flavorful and although the Mac n Cheese itself was not too flavorful the gravy from the poutine made the flavor just right. I did not think that it would be such a great combo but it was absolutely delicious together. I am generally not a huge fan of hot dogs but this one was pretty good, very flavorful but I liked the poutine a lot more. I would definitely come back to try their other poutine options.   The staff member that was here was extremely helpful and nice as well! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place long before trying it and I'm as to say I was a tad disappointed. Walking in unnoticed the diner feel to it, with celebs pictures all over the walls eating hot dogs, Superbad playing in the tv screens, very nostalgic to say the least that was a big plus! Now for the food.  We took a few different hot dogs and some poutines, I took the nacho libre which had melted cheese sauce, crushed tortilla, sour cream, pico de gallo and green onion on a pork hot dog. The hotdog itself lacked taste, but the topping were great, the problem here is he bread, it gets to soggy and breaks, too much bread also, but i understand they need larger buns to support those huge combination.   We also had Queb hotdog which was topped with smoke meat, also tasted okay but the actual hot dog didn't shine. We also too the poutine topped with Mac and cheese, this was delicious. At the end this place left me wanting more, if I return I would have to try the all beef hotdog, I'm glad I finally gave it a shot though."}
{"text":"La bouffe est bonne. Maintenant ils livrent et sont ouvert tard. Le seul hic c'est que le livreur est à pied et les contenants laissent échapper la chaleur, alors on doit réchauffer le tout... Dommage!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem and I'm so glad we came here! Number one, the wait staff is FANTASTIC! They were so nice and spoke perfect English. My waitress even gave me more recommendations for other bars in the area. The way the food works is you pick a hotdog hamburger or poutine and there are lots of different topping options. I got the pig Mac (pork and Mac and cheese) and my boyfriend got the queb (lots of meat). Both were super amazing. And again the waitress was very good at checking on us and bringing us more beer and a box. I highly recommend if you are on Rue St. Denis."}
{"text":"The food is really top notch at this tiny hole in the wall on Mont Royal. We originally came here for the under-advertised Mac and Cheese week but didn't really find any mac and cheese specials at Dirty Dogs. We decided to split the Notorious P.I.G. (pulled pork, mustard, pickles), Maurice Richard (foie gras, caramelized onions, bacon) and large mac and cheese poutine.   Both the hot dogs and poutine were satisfying but not overly greasy. Not sure where they get their buns but they are perfection. I was particularly happy about the cheese curds on the poutine in addition to the mac and cheese. In terms of service, we were impressed with the short wait time given the full house and only one cook on the grill.   The only reason Dirty Dogs gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the poor ventilation - The charcoal smell is really overwhelming and pretty much unbearable once you finish your meal."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to be open for ages, so when I saw that they had finally set up shop, I dropped all other dinner plans and made my way over.   Wanted to start simple, so I went with the classic Denis Coderre (sausage, coleslaw, onions, mustard, everything bagel seeds) and the homemade Mac and Cheese.   Now, I'm no dog connoisseur, but that first bite is something that I will remember forever. Expertly cooked, perfectly garnished... it was magic. I couldn't go in for a second bite just yet without my head exploding from awesomeness, so I decided to pace myself with a bite of the Mac and Cheese. Big mistake. It was equally delicious. Anyway, now I'm sitting here with an exploded head, which means no mouth to finish this delicious food. And even though I no longer have a face, it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Dirty Dogs is a tiny spot serving up gourmet-style hot dogs in the Plateau.  If you're not paying attention it's very easy to walk by it and the restaurant only seats a few people inside of it.  Prices are a bit high compared to your average hot dog place but these are not your average Montreal steamies so I didn't mind paying the extra money.  The hot dogs come with all sorts of toppings like macaroni and cheese, chili, etc..  I went for the Notorious P.I.G. which was topped with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, pickles and caramelized onions.  They use much higher quality sausages here than other hot dog places and the pulled pork was seriously good.  It was tender and juicy.  for $3 extra you can get fries and a drink with it and they certainly give you a good portion of what are delicious fries.  Come here hungry because you will be full when you leave.    My only real complaint was that the seating wasn't that great.  I found the stools very wobbly and all around uncomfortable.  I did like the service as the two guys working there when I went were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  In all I enjoyed my first visit and will probably be back again in the future to try their other hot dogs."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's a bit expensive for what you get. I've been twice, once for a hot dog and once for a burger.  The hot dogs and burgers are good, there's a good amount of variety for what you can get in it. However, the cheapest things they have here are $13 (for a hot dog I think), which is quite expensive considering 80% of the plate is fries. It'll fill you up, but only cause you're eating a lot of fries (which aren't worth the price at all).   The service is fine, nothing that stood out to me though. Nice location but the music can get a little loud at times!  It's something you might think is worth trying just because it's been hyped up quite a bit, but keep in mind that you're paying around $20 (after tax+tip) for fries with a side of hot dog"}
{"text":"My second time at dirty dogs and  it's again a great experience! Their hotdogs are very good , lots of different combinations, love the homemade pork sausage.  The service is exacly how it should be, they're not overdoing it but they are efficient and nice. Oh and they have a great poutine too.  Will definitely go again !"}
{"text":"Il m'ont eu il y quelques années avec leur évènement \"Free Mac&cheese dog\". J'ai aimé la sélection de différent hotdogs gourmet. Depuis les rénovations récente, il y a plus de places assises pour manger. Leur poutine est bonne mais on y va pour les chiens-chaud. Le staff est toujours accueillant et disponible pour nous aider à choisir notre envie de gras!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE \"service\" .. waited 40 minutes for a mac & cheese poutine and the worst part is that the place wasn't all that busy. Same great tasting poutine but it seems they may have downsized on the portions. Next time ill just go to their mount-royal location but I'll definitely won't be going back to this new location."}
{"text":"Hot-Dog Gourmet ? Bof ! J'ai pas l'habitude de critiquer négativement mais là oui. L'endroit a été modernisé depuis son ouverture mais ça reste un petit local (max 8p). Déco/ambiance froide. Le menu est affiché sans les prix, à moins que j'aille mal vu. Personnellement, je voulais manger pour le lunch un hot-dog gourmet de qualité en ce mercredi après-midi nuageux et je ne sais pas si j'ai mal choisi mais un gros bof sérieux ! J'ai pris le hot-dog ''k-pop'' kimchis+sésames noirs + frites + 1 coke = 12.75$ Assez cher pour ce que c'est, à mon humble avis, ça ne vaut pas ce prix là. La saucisse était pas assez cuite & le pain froid. Je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus classe et plus savoureux, goûteux. Les kimchis étaient bons eux, c'est tout ce qu'il y avait de positif dans le hot-dog. Frites ok. Le proprio à la caisse n'était pas non plus, des plus aimables. Je ne sais pas si il y a d'autres places de hot-dogs gourmets de qualité à Montréal, mais je pense qu'on peut faire vraiment mieux dans cette ville dans ce secteur culinaire ''comfort food''. Je vais m'en tenir dorénavant au classique, ketchup, relish, moutarde des ''vrais'' institutions montréalaises ! lol ! Merci.   2/5 visité en mars 2016."}
{"text":"This place had been on my list since they opened, I wasn't expecting anything special but I was wrong! It's GOOD.  We ordered a beef sausage hot dog with the boss garnish and a \"tornade de viande\" burger and it was excellent! They serve homemade fries so I will have to go back to try the Mac n Cheese poutine! Maybe a little pricy but the generous portions make up for it. Try the mezcalito cocktail!"}
{"text":"Wow. Never have I ever had such an amazing poutine! Being featured as one of the top places of go in Montreal definitely owns up to its rep!   Right off the bat, the presentation of these things are enticing! You can't help but plunge yourself into these poutines. We ordered the Mac n Cheese Poutine and hotdog. The poutine was spot on however, not so much for the hot dog and mac n cheese. There was nothing really striking about the hotdog in addition to the mac n cheese. I felt that the mac n cheese was quite bland and lacked that cheesey flavour however, eating it with the poutine was okay. We also ordered the Big Boss. It was on the sweet and sour taste spectrum which absolutely hits my taste buds. Love love love it! My fav was the pulled pork poutine. The pork was very tender and juicy, drenched in a sweet BBQ I believe. Even though I was full, I couldn't help but to keep digging my fork into this stuff!"}
{"text":"Employee was nice but they were out of their signature dish (with mac and cheese), out of pogos and out of coke! The bun of hotdogs is served cold. The cheese does not melt. The poutine sauce and cheese was cold. There is a lot of oregano in the poutine gravy. The homemade pork sausage is fatty and hard and not tasty at all.  Sorry, but I would avoid."}
{"text":"Best cocktails ever, the bartenders and the waiters were very sweet and charming, and the food was good."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great food, slow-ish service even though they weren't very busy when we were there, but just seemed to take a long time to receive water, then our food, then the bill. But, the hot dogs and poutine were really good. Got the hot dog with pulled pork. Very good. Overall, neat dining room look and really good food."}
{"text":"Hot dogs clearly dirty ! Un arrêt nocturne bien cochon. On a testé celui au mac & cheese et celui dont la saucisse est cuite dans la bière.  Le plein est délicieux ! Mon chum a adoré les deux, pour ma part j'ai trouvé que c'était trop salé. Pas grave, contente d'avoir enfin tester ce petit à emporter sur mont royal !"}
{"text":"After a long night of pub crawling my wife and I headed home when we started to fill hungry. We passed near the Dirty Dogs and at first didnt even think to look inside since I am a vegetarian and my wife is vegan, but my wife said I wonder if they do have a vegan option...  Inside we were surprised not only to find vege poutine but also 3 vegan hot-dogs option with a vegan bun option YAY. We both ordered the Kimchi-dog which was very nice. I tought it is a little expensive but again it tasted real good and vegan food is still a little hard to find in this city so yes I am a fan"}
{"text":"Le concept est juste au TOP ! Il y a un tas de poutines et de hot dogs. Difficile de faire mon choix rapidement mais je n'ai pas été déçu de ma Poutine, vraiment bien assaisonné avec les oignons, super bien présenté dans son packaging, j'ai adoré. Par contre une amie avait commandé un Hot-dog buf au pesto, je l'ai trouver sans plus. Le restaurant est petit mais c'est tout mignon, on a envie d'y rester quand même !"}
{"text":"love the sauce, there's something fragrant and gourmet to it, i know it's thyme they put thyme in a poutine sauce, congradulation, who would of thought, the pulled pork melted perfectly in that juicy, creamy sauce and they really used the best cheese, i now believe poutine can be thhaaat good :)"}
{"text":"Made a quick visit to Dirty Dogs recently before heading to the airport.  The staff was very friendly.  High marks for a positive interaction and helping me figure out what I wanted (first visit).    My only real problem was that I wanted small servings just to try the fare.  Should've had someone there with me to share in the lunch.  Also, before I forget, I really liked exploring the Plateau Mont Royal area.  Neat area.  Vibrant.  My main focus was on the Le Boss Dog which was very good.  I left 80% of the bun behind but really liked the rest.  Nice color with the onions and mustard.   Also ordered the smaller size shredded meat Poutine - but it was still a huge helping.  I am not a huge fan of Poutine so I should not judge this offering.  I did like the meat, but I don't really care for the gravy and cheese mixture.  But, I now it is popular and am glad I finally tried this Montreal staple.  If you're in Montreal, take a quick trip to Dirty Dogs.  Nice (but small) seating inside allowed me to people watch while I ate.  Nice experience on a beautiful day in Montreal!"}
{"text":"A walkable distance from the intersection of St-Laurent and Mont-Royal, this fast food serves the original comfort food that comes to mind with its own twist.  Today I tried the Mac n cheese poutine which was as tasty as it photographs. Instagram helped me find this lovely joint that I recommend to poutine lovers of all kind! The poutines at Dirty Dogs have won best poutine awards however this place also has hot dogs of all sorts which are comprised of homemade sides/fillings, sausages, sauces and even buns!   In the summertime they have a lovely terrace on the street to enjoy the goods under the sun and embrace the city life.   Amazing!"}
{"text":"Fun Place, great decor   Parking is difficult but come on you're downtown so it's to be expected.   Food is good, quality is there, price is super descent.  Vegetarian and vegan friendly, tofu dog is   Great twist on classic hot dog, burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  Popped in for lunch and was delighted with the service, drinks and food.  Tried the Bloody Caesar drink - was BEYOND delicious!  One of the best I've had.  Don't miss if it you're a bloody mary fan... and drink from glass, not straw. One of us had a pork hotdog \"pig mac\" with the mac n cheese with pork on top.  Let's be clear - don't go here on a diet because this dish is so insanely good that you WILL eat the whole thing. I had a burger with the pork on top with a salad to go \"low carb\".  Beyond delicious.  It carmelized onions on the burger/pork sandwich and the salad was amazing.  Simple, but really good. They have tons of poutine dishes also which I didn't try - but all looked spectacular.  On top of the insanely yummy food, our server Jerry was SO nice!  He was attentive, funny, friendly and helpful.  I haven't had such friendly service like that in a long time.  It was just a wonderful experience.  LOVE THIS PLACE and totally going back!"}
{"text":"Every week (well almost anyway...), I head up the Main to Hof Kelsten for my dose of fresh rye or sourdough bread. Thinking about grabbing something different for lunch on one particular occasion, I was reminded that Dirty Dogs was only a minute away on foot serving up gourmet hot dogs. I had first heard of Dirty Dogs in the spring via some friends but never found the moment to go. My first chance had been during the Mont-Royal street fair earlier this summer but their free hot dog special that day created a lineup that snaked off Mont-Royal and down Saint-Laurent street so that didn't happen. Seeming like the perfect lunch option in this instance, away I went with my loaf of bread in hand.   Dirty Dogs is a small diner space with maybe 8 seats inside but thankfully there is a takeout window in the case where seating inside isn't possible. The interior is a rustic diner look - dark wood bar counter, wood panels on the walls. It is a sparse space but functional. At least the music is a good mix as you wait for your order!  The menu consists of 10 special dogs each with their own unique toppings and sausages. Each hot dog can also be modified for the vegetarians among us which is a cool touch from a hot dog place. To pair with the dogs, there are a number of sides and drinks to enjoy. Given that this was a solo mission on my first visit, I actually went back a second time to enjoy other items off the menu - good time I have a build-in excuse with my bakery of choice...  The side I tried was their mac n' cheese - made to order nicely enough and topped with crispy bacon and green onions. Creamy enough but something didn't click with me... perhaps the cheese wasn't strong enough. Not sure to be honest. The bacon added some nice crunch although personally I would have preferred softer to get the fattiness into the macaroni. Might as well go full glutton.  I went all in with my first visit so I ordered the \"Maurice Richard\" - Bourbon vanilla sausage with pan seared foie gras, bacon, 3 year old aged cheddar, caramlized onions and maple syrup. A pricy dog but one that packs a heck of a punch. The sweetness of the vanilla bourbon sausage is subtle but still noticeable which is a good thing given the sweet kick from the onions and the maple syrup. Add to that mix a general amount of foie gras and plenty of bacon and you have quite a hot dog on your hands! Only negative to me was the bun - i actually like the choice of bun used but they are barely served warm... I would preferred them more steamed or even grilled!  For the second visit, I went a little more traditional in my choices. I ordered the \"Denis Coderre\" - Fine herb pork sausage, coleslaw, onions, yellow mustard and bagel seeds - with a side of regular fries and spicy mayo. Fine issue with the bun again. The hot dog itself is solid - you pick up the fine herb taste in the sausage, the coleslaw/onion/mustard combo is classic and continues to be so. The bagel seeds is an interesting addition that works well. The classic fries are exactly the kind of fries I like with my hot dogs - very reminiscent of your classic Belle Province/ Lafleur. The house spicy mayo had a nice kick to it as well. A solid second visit.  All in all, Dirty Dogs is a solid bet from what I tried. I like the more unique approach to the dogs and the varied choices you have. The macaroni didn't do it for me but I enjoyed the rest. The price on the higher end dogs may turn off some people used to more standard pataterie prices... same goes for waiting time since these dogs take longer than your regular steamey. Overall a worthwhile visit if you are in need of a bite near the plateau.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"[This review is ONLY based on my experience during the grand opening. I haven't experienced regular day-to-day service yet.]   This is the first dirty dogs I've been too.   I went for the grand opening, because they were offering a free Poutine to the first 100 people. I waited about an hour before they started handing out tickets and got seated another 30min later.   They didn't have a lot of room on the terrasse, but I don't know if it was just that day or if it's always like that.   During 4-7pm, a pint of beer is 5$.   The regular Poutine that we got (for free that day) is usually 5$ which is a really great price!   The Poutine had generous amounts of cheese curds which is awesome! It also had a ton of sauce and the fries were good (nothing extraordinary, but definitely good). The sauce was a little salty for my taste though.   The staff was very attentive too. Even though there were a lot of people, my waiter made sure to come check on me to make sure that food was okay.   The things that kind of turned me off were the music and the videos. Let me explain. I was sitting less than 1m away from my boyfriend and we had to yell and get really close to hear each other. Even then, there were a lot of \"WHAT?\" and \"HUH?\" On their big TV screens that are places around the restaurant, there were just clip after clip of violence (taken from various movies)! And it's pretty graphic violence too. Lucky for me I wasn't facing any TVs, but after getting a few glimpses, it killed my appetite.   All in all, food and service were great! I'd adjust the volume of the music and maybe change the channel though!"}
{"text":"Great food, worth the visit. Friendly bunch of guys."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend, Ocea (insta: @oceaoceaocea). I ordered the poutine with the mac, large-style. It was really good! Super huge but I ate aall of it! Yum!   Ocea on the other hand, was not a fan.  - She said it tasted like she was at a fundraiser - She found the mustard overpowering - She thought the buns were of low quality   and when she puts it like that I can totally see where she's coming from. I mean they did JUST remodel, they could afford to up the quality of the dogs and train their staff better in applying the condiments (our server was super friendly, so was the busser [it was his first day and he was doing really well] so just the staff that deals with the condiments) and get some new buns in there.   She really dug the coconut bacon and she was happy with the amount of fries she received.   I think when we take into consideration all of Ocea's comments Dirty Dogs gets about a 3.   Thanks! :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Dirty Dogs for Montreal Mac & Cheese Week but, as mentioned below, there weren't really any Mac & Cheese \"specials\" per se--just regular menu items. Regardless, we still walked away having sampled their M&C and very satisfied.   We ordered the Notorious P.I.G. and the Maurice Richard dogs and the Mac & Cheese Poutine to split--cause go big or go home right? The dogs were superrrr tasty and the foie gras on the Maurice Richard was on point! The Poutine M&C was RICH--mac and cheese PLUS cheese curds is a whole lot of cheese and I loved every second of it. Wouldn't recommend if you're not into that sort of thing. Nothing particularly oustanding about the mac & cheese in itself I wouldn't say but the dish as a whole was a bowl of yumminess.  Not too much seating area in Dirty Dogs and it's quite smokey--would be great to do takeaway and head to a nearby park in the summer."}
