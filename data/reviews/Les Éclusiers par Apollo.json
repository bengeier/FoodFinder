{"text":"This spot hosts an outdoor bbq cookout every weekend as well as an inspired brunch menu to set the pace for your day in the old port for fireworks, rollerblading, or people watching... or hitting up a spot whose kitchen is open late! If you're there to catch up with some friends after work, or grub on some comfort food, Les Éclusiers should be a blip on your radar."}
{"text":"If you're into the very loud electronic music club vibe on the water and care not for quality of food and drink then this is your place. I'm not sure who in my partner's family picked this place for a wedding rehearsal dinner, but I feel like I should blame the wedding planner who missed a lot of details re the wedding itself (then I can keep the blame outside the family).  We were trying to have a dining/family/celebration experience in a restaurant, but it felt like a nightclub. And the food was insultingly terrible. Who's this Apollo guy? Hopefully not a famous chef. OK, so the food was edible. Nothing was inedible. But it should have been WAY better for the price. I make better risotto in my sleep.  Another waterfront/riverfront place that thinks it doesn't have to be good because it attracts business based on its location alone. I'd avoid."}
{"text":"The trick to appreciating Éclusiers is to go in with the right expectations. On the water at the locks in the Old Port of Montreal, the setting is lovely and calming and the decor is bright and nice for daytime drinking with a crew of fashionable friends. Wide couches in bright red, swings, shady booths, and rows of lounge chairs make this an excellent summer indulgence if you are looking for that clubbing-outside-in-the-afternoon vibe. I have found the food over-priced and underwhelming, but I would go back to Éclusiers on a sunny evening with my single ladies for 5a7 (with half-price drink specials) in a heartbeat.  Note: It's only open seasonally - May to around September."}
{"text":"Pas pire, pas pire. De l'extérieur, ça l'air correct et des fois la musique devient tentante mais pas vraiment plus que ça. J'y suis allée pour un événement et j'ai été plus impressionnée que ce à quoi je m'attendais. C'est le 2e étage qui a été mon coup de coeur avec de vieux meubles restaurés et dépareillés, et des chandeliers vraiment originaux et une belle vu autant sur le Vieux-Port que sur les éclusiers du Canal Lachine. Le staff était efficace et gentil. Les prix des drinks étaient corrects considérant l'emplacement et la bouffe, ou du moins les bouchées auxquelles j'ai goûté étaient bien aussi."}
