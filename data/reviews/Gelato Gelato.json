{"text":"Great place for stove oven pizza. Under $20 you get a medium sized pizza, thin crust. Tasty dough .  We tried their Fritto Misto mix, calamari and shrimps. Good portion and yummy in ze tummy.    Service was prompt and friendly, even though there was a large birthday crowd in the restaurant.   Will come again to try their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Gelato isn't terrible but definitely not the best. The reason we will not be coming back has more to do with the bad service and the extremely rude gelato scooper (in his 60s, possibly the owner if you have the displeasure of being served by him)."}
{"text":"So I did come back to give the pistachio flavour a try and thank goodness it was there!  Walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was pretty empty but our server was nice and allowed us to sample several flavours.   I decided upon a 2 scoop cup for $5 with pistachio and bacio which both had great nutty flavours, were smooth, creamy and not overwhelmingly sweet. My cousin also got the pistachio and their mango which I tried and thought had a nice preserved mango flavour and light sweetness.   Overall, I'm glad I came back and hopefully I'll try the more traditional sounding flavours the next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"The gelato is made in house and is very authentic The pizza is fantastic and and will stand up to any of the top wood oven pizza joints in the area hands down   This review is short but so is the menu, try the pizza, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Gelato is alright, not the greatest.  La Paloma is way better better than this place and it's down the street.  Customer service at Gelato Gelato is pretty horrible too.  People there are rude!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Go to La Paloma or Il Gelato di Carlotta instead! Probably the worst \"gelato\" I've had in a while that came with crusty service. I know nothing beats the real thing from Italy but don't be rude, pretend like you're the real deal, charge $5 for a small scoop and not be able to even pronounce the names of your flavours...Both the pistachio & gianduja gelato were flavourless and came with icicles."}
{"text":"Delicious, lightning fast pizza. I'm really not sure how they turn it around so fast. The ice cream is great too. A good place to bring kids because of the fast service.  A solid choice."}
{"text":"Came around 1-2pm to grab some gelato after lunch and decided on getting the four scoop and shared with my boyfriend. I got tiramisu, Nutella, lemon and pistachio. Mind you, the lemon was nice and tart with a hint of sweetness and the pistachio was actually pretty good . Most places don't make good pistachio ice cream or gelato but I enjoy this one at this location. But the other two flavour tiramisu and Nutella was super grosssssss. I couldn't even take a second bite ."}
{"text":"I know most people must be thinking this is just an ice cream place but these guys make awesome pizza!  There are a ton of good pizzerias in Vaughan (and I've tried most of them), but this place keeps me coming back over and over again for the amazing pizza.  The tomato sauce is fresh and pizza crust is sooo crispy and light!  The service is good and the pizzas come out quick from the wood burning stone oven.  Then finish off your meal with some great gelato for the perfect end to your lunch or dinner. Give them a try and I'm sure you'll keep coming back like I do!"}
{"text":"NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN 1) The only drink menu is a list of bottles of wine to buy! What kind of pizza place sells a $168 bottle of wine but not individual glasses, or a beer or any single drink ?!! So pissed off. I wanted to have a nice date night here.   2) pizza isn't that good. And it's so expensive to. Famoso has amazing pizza! I wish they were closer.   3) it's so hard to get a server's attention and service.     However, From my past experiences and reviews here they have Yummy Delicious Gelato. That is at an affordable price."}
{"text":"came for gelato only.... because we had tried paloma and their prices were alot higher for one scoop =_= and they have a one sample per customer which sounded stupid... so we tried this place.  they dont have a variety but they have enough flabours to choose from. the guy serving us was kind and patient. He let us try different flavours. this was saturday at around 2pm. Service was good.  Gelato portion was good.    i would have prefered the 2 diffefrnt flavours side by side versus one on top of the other..but it was good none the less.   great price . nice searing area. good service."}
{"text":"Gelato were big disappointment. No longer like before. Doesn't even fill the cup. Just a tiny scoop.   Despite made in house, texture is watery, not creamy, flavors are not strong.   Not worth the money. Go get yourself a tub of regular ice cream you will be more satisfied."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic.  Probably the best pizza in Woodbridge. Always get the fiordilatte pizza"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. It's been about four or five years since my last visit, and I was very excited to bring my parents and husband here for dessert. It did not go well. My mother ordered the brioche ice cream sandwich. What she got was a week-old hamburger bun that could clean burned-on scum from a filthy roasting pan. It had the exact texture of one of those blue kitchen scrubbers. When I brought it back to the counter to let them know it was inedible, the gaggle of young ice cream scoopers politely accepted it back, not surprised in the least. It was an odd exchange, and in the end my mother got two scoops of strawberry ice cream instead. But the strawberry ice cream tasted like jello mix in milk... I felt awful about choosing this place! Fortunately, everyone else had chosen better than my poor mother! My dad and my husband had the tiramisu ice cream, and I had the lemon. Mine was delicious, and refreshing. But looking at my mom poke at her pink melting mess made me sad :("}
{"text":"Five stars for pizza and the Gelato. It's a pizza joint, it feels like it, and it definitely tastes like it. The frutti de mare was impeccable. The crust the light and crispy moistness that just has the right mouthfeel for pizza, with shellfish baked on the pie (yes it's a pie, pizza pie) then there is dessert. The Gelato is great. Get the buccio of you think Nutella is real and then never buy Nutella again and spend for real chocolate and hazelnut spread. Go here, be happy, on the pricey side but well worth it and you could still go for beers after."}
{"text":"The food is decent, good ice cream but their service is total garbage.  The owner is racist and rude. The guy is in his 60s with grey hair. I went around 8pm, he takes a look at me and mumbles racist comments in Italian. I was with my buddies who speak Italian and they promptly told me what he said. I called him out on it and he flat out denies it. I should have recorded this guy. I'm east Asian.  If you look down below, another customer had a similar experience."}
{"text":"Gelato Gelato!!  On a hot summer day, I was happy to enjoy enjoy some gelato too!  There are over 30 different flavours to choose from. What should I have? Decision Decision..  $4.42 for 2 scoops either in a cone or a cup.  Torrone/Hazelnut Tiramisu/Frutti di Bosco (Mixed Berries)  Creamy and Rich... The flavour is quite intense.  Patio is nice to chill out under the stars...  PS they opens at 8 AM on weekdays.. does that means I can have gelato for breakfast too?? or a cappuccino I guess..."}
{"text":"The gelato is okay. I think this is best suited to be a place you take kids to when they are hungry for gelato. Not much to say here. Wife had the lemon - she liked it. Father in law and I had the tiramisu and it was okay. I don't know what my mother in law had but it had strawberry in it I think - she thought it was okay."}
