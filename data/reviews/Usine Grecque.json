{"text":"Overall meh. I ordered pork souvlaki pita meal to go and wish I had not.The food was mediocre at best. I got pork pita sandwich, fries and salad. The porc in the pita was premade and slightly warmed up however that was not the excuse for the pork to taste like I am chewing on pieces of rubber covered with tzaziki. Salad and fries left me for wanting more as well. Fries were fast food style, premade and prepackaged tastings like something from Burger King not a greek style eatery. Salad was also premade very early in the day or perhaps even the day before. Lettuce was saggy and so was red onion that usually keeps better. Green peppers in a greek salad? I guess red peppers are too expensive :(. Luckily, there were couple of kalamata olives and some feta cheese so it can be called \"greek\". And no rice. For $13.74 tax in, I will not be returning to give it a second chance. There are much better take out places in the hood for $10."}

{"text":"Première fois à ce restaurant. Les souvlakis de poulet sont très bon et les portions sont très généreuses. L'assiette comprend souvlaki, riz, frites, tzatziki et pita et ajoutez à cela une grosse salade grecque emballé individuellement."}
