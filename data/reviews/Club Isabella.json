{"text":"Top notch setting and food to match.

Marta makes it hum!"}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed. I was getting excited about going to Club Isabella despite its mixed reviews. Today, I decided to go for it. I called beforehand to see if they took dogs on the patio, and the lady who answered said yes. 

So I show up. There's no one outside on the patio to seat people, so finally I wander into the foyer of the restaurant with my dog. A man comes out of the back area and says that dogs aren't allowed in the restaurant (mind you, my dog isn't even in the restaurant. She's standing on an industrial carpet thing in the entryway). I said that I was just looking for someone to seat me out in the patio. He says, \"Well the weather is cold and rainy, so the patio is closed.\" He said this in an extremely rude tone of voice (and I told him so). Also, it was 86 deg with a 20% chance of rain (it had rained earlier in the day). Really? If you are going to have your patio closed in Cleveland during the summer every time it's in the mid 80s with a chance of rain, you might as well not have the patio. I said, \"Well, it's actually not raining now.\" Then, the man says, \"Well, I can't seat you with a dog.\" Really? I told him that I had called earlier, and he basically said that he would be the one answering the phones (almost implying that I was lying about having called to ask about bringing a dog). I told him a woman had answered, and then he grudgingly apologized as I walked away. 

This is truly the opposite of good customer service, and there is no way I am going back to try their food. Good luck if you do."}
{"text":"I've been to club Isabella a few times, and really don't understand why it's always so empty. The food is pricey but delicious and the atmosphere very nice. Sometimes they have a piano player which is a nice touch and not so loud that you can't have s conversation. On the patio you can sometimes hear the train which I also kind of like. Atmosphere is nothing is the food isn't good, and everything I've had was excellent. The drinks are not bad but not quite what Id expect. The service is generally attentive but could maybe be a little friendlier? Tonight our waiter just seemed like he maybe had s rough day. It can be kind of slow at times. Overall the food and atmosphere are excellent, the service and drinks good. Consistent restaurants in all regards are hard to find in the area so this is on my roster of the better options in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Don't be deterred by the suggestively \"euro-nightlife\" name. I have been to Club Isabella a few times since I moved from Chicago about a year and a half ago, and am consistently impressed with the atmosphere, hospitality, and quality of food and drinks.

As a Case Western graduate student, Club Isabella's location is ideal for after-class happy hour specials that don't include dollar pitchers of Coors light - keeping the wilder campus clientele at an appreciated distance. The interior is gorgeous, the pizzas are delicious and perfect for small plate sharing, and the drinks are phenomenal.

Our bartender Jeff was friendly, funny, and attentive - the perfect mix of professional and personable. $10/drink is reasonable to me considering he used quality liquor, customized each martini to suit our individual tastes, and served each one in a spotless glass that he inspected personally. We had the Elder Wand*, Apple, and Pear martinis. Did I mention that they were phenomenal? I've paid far more for drinks that were far inferior.

Some Yelpers have complained about the parking situation. We valeted out of laziness for $5 but you know what, he opened all of our doors on arrival and departure and had the car ready to drive away before we even walked out to present him with our ticket.

Of course I will be back.

{"text":"We arranged to have a special anniversary celebration to honor our parents.  Arriving on a blustery snowy evening, our table was ready and inviting.  This turned out to be one of the most special dinners we have shared in a long time.  Kari, our server, welcomed us and knew that we were celebrating a 35th wedding anniversary.  Her wine suggestions were spot on. We shared a wedge salad and tartare sampler.  Both were perfect with the deep fried egg cooked to perfection with a liquid egg yolk that completed the dishes.  For the main course, we ordered salmon with udon noodles, the sturgeon special, the beef fillet special, lamb shank and flat iron steak - all the best versions of these dishes we had ever tasted!  Dessert was a complementary assortment including white chocolate mousse in puff pastry, and fig tart.  All were excellent!  We ended the evening with a fortification of single malt scotch sitting around the fireplace, the snow swirling over University Circle beyond the wall of windows.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"Definitely not going back.  Woman who runs this place is crazy.  Prices are insane.  Food is good, but atmosphere is tense."}
{"text":"Was a bit apprehensive after reading a number of bad reviews on the service but was eager to go because of the descriptions of the food.  A sleek, bright, stimulating and inviting space hits an encouraging opening note.  Hendricks, muddled cucumber and hibiscus liqueur gets the engine purring.  Steamed buns du jour filled with pork belly (dim sum sans cart) followed by the tartare sampler with toast slats and breaded deep fried poached egg.  A tremendous start.  The peppery arugula salad was nicely balanced by a sweet pea vinaigrette although the goat cheese stuffed potato was undercooked.  My walleye was crisply browned with a moist interior and was nicely complemented by the celery root slaw but the wild rice was too salty.  My wife's cassoulet was served in a bowl and once the cauldron's temperature fell below kiln level it was savory and smoky.  The remains will be enjoyed at home while watching Mad Men.  Finished with a nice tiramisu and then over to Corbo's for tomorrow night's dessert.  I can't wait to get back to Club Isabella because I need to try the cuttlefish, the charcuterie, the frog legs, the baked beans, a pizza...."}
{"text":"Did not gave a great experience. We and another couple attended. Bar tender nice guy but drink pours were sadly lacking content. That was unfortunate. Call it on the cheap side. Saturday nite and no live entertainment. Noted for their jazz. Had dinner. My friend and I had to take back our steaks. The worst cut of meat ever. My friend ordered another type of steak from the menu. It was the same worst cut of meat, just sliced differently and with another sauce on it. I had what my wife had- the fish. Mediocre at best.
Service was great - prices way to high for lack of quality. It would be hard to go back."}
{"text":"Cool place great cocktails try the cutle fish and Bone in filet
Check out patio and the Bar is real nice"}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful interior. We came here for dinner, on a company's dime, so I wasn't really focusing on prices, but they did seem a little steep for what you get. We tried the lamb meatballs and calamari, which were both great! I also had the pancetta maple salad, which sounds amazing but was disappointing. I had the filet au poivre for dinner, which was good but served with some sweet potato casserole thingy that I could have done without. Dessert was chocolate cheesecake, which was rich and delicious. 

I loved the esthetic of the place, and can see myself coming back for drinks. 

Tip: We went on a Tuesday and were that it was ok told to park in the valet zone on Random Road since they didn't have valet service that night."}
{"text":"Club Isbella was a tremendous disappointment and has left me completely distrustful of the servers, managers and owners.  Please do not go here if you expect to be treated with any respect.

Went here for dinner with my family when my boyfriend and I were in town visiting for Christmas.  My boyfriend wanted to take my parents out for an upscale dinner to thank them for having him for Christmas.  Unfortunately, we decided to go out too late and Fire and Albatross were all booked :( Club Isbella was an unknown 3rd choice.  The food was so-so, had an excellent ratatouille, but other than that everything was okay.

Here comes the major problem: the server told us about the nights specials, which included a caviar appetizer.  She sold my boyfriend on it and he ordered it - unfortunately she did not mention the price-tag and my boyfriend didn't want to be rude and ask.  Being semi-foodies, not really, we did not know much about caviar, but expected it to be around $30-40 (all the other appetizers were $10-15).  The bill came and the caviar was $120 - what we thought was an outrageous price for an extremely mediocre dish that did not even include an entire jar of caviar.  

My bf didn't say anything at the time, not wanting to ruin the evening, but we when we called to discuss this with the owners on Monday, we were lied to, treated with disrespect, and mocked for being uneducated about caviar.  A server pretended to be a manager and when I finally did get a manager on the phone, she talked to me like I was an idiot.  She finally told me she would reimburse us for $80 of the $120 dollars - which never happened.  

If the food had been spectacular, maybe we could forgive the terrible service and disrespect.  As it is, Club Isabella seems to have forgotten the caveat that the customer is always right."}
{"text":"What happened?  Went to CI days after they opened.  Service, food, pricing, everything terrific. Could not wait to go back. Went Aug 6,Sat evening.  Unbelievable attitude. Got lacto-intolerance. Tough. Can't serve salad, etc. without cheese spec'd in menu.  Got problem with nuts, tough. Can't take off dish.  Need olive oil with bread versus butter.  Tough, no oil.  Got high blood pressure and want the fish without the salt, tough, comes as is on menu.  Bottom line, you get exactly what is on menu and if you've got a problem move on.  Never had this happen before in my life. They are wrecking a place that has so much potential.  Made me wonder if the kitchen has been taken over by zombies who only heat and serve.  The quality of the food is not a question.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Club Isabella is my new favorite spot. Last nights meal fused flavors & techniques   igniting romantic food memories of meals past. We found ourselves comparing this meal with our all time best dinning experiences on the road and in our hometown .  Club Isabella
competes for top spot.  We started with the cuttlefish, tender & crispy we loved the sweet & spicy sauce making it an instant hit. Next we worked our way through the charcuterie assortment. Its nice to see the attention to detail & technique. This was old world done right,only to be interrupted by the house cured salmon gravlox. The microgreen & arugula salad  popped with a pickled cherry vinaigrette, building excitement to our entrees arrival. We ordered the specials for dinner, Chef Fabio did not disappoint. Crab stuffed lobster tail served over creamy barley risotto & pheasant prepared 2 ways. We finished our meal with the Basil Panna Cotta & coffee. We drove home trying to remember the last time we had a meal this good. This was a night to remember & we will be back."}
{"text":"nice space; good wine list and good pasta. my one disappointment (and this has been true for every Italian place I've tried in Cleveland) was that the pasta just seemed like pasta from a box. the sauce was great, very tasty, but the noodles were so underwhelming."}
{"text":"$5 to a valet who made it clear that he wanted the money upfront. $16 for a two inch piece of not too fresh salmon and a fingerling potato sliced into two pieces. A harried waitress who forgot to serve bread.

There are too many other venues for lunch in the area to tolerate any of this.

This was a very nice place initially, but it's gone downhill."}
{"text":"This place serves OLD food. I got sea bass, and it tasted like it might be foul, but I figured it may have been fine and me overreacting to a fishiness. Then when the server asked how everything was, I told him the fish tasted like it may be spoiled (most of it was uneaten on my plate) and he admitted the kitchen, \"sometimes serves food longer than they should,\" which I took to mean questionably old.

He bought us dessert and I think he went out of his way to make the rest of the night a good experience, but if the waitstaff admits they sell old food why would I go back? I won't."}
{"text":"I'm puzzled by the negative reviews. I'm visiting from out of town (but grew up in Cleveland) and had a great experience at Club Isabella. In fact, my family and I went twice -- once for dinner, then the next night to listen to the man playing the piano. He's fantastic. We noticed two members of the Cleveland Orchestra stopped to have dinner after their concert we attended.

The food at the place is also great. Indeed, Cleveland has a phenomenal foodie scene. I'd consider Club Isabella among them."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice decor, courteous prompt service. Food was innovative and excellent. First time but will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice lunches on the patio. Over the course of two visits we had the tagliatelle, the fish tacos, the croque monsieur, the moules frites, the shrimp, clam & mussel pizza and the banh mi. The dishes were well presented but there were a few missteps.  

The fish tacos were weird in that the fish was breaded so it was a bit like eating fish and chips on a tortilla. The pizza was okay but not spectacular. The croque Monsieur a bit greasy and the bread for the banh mi overwhelmed the sandwich. A traditional banh mi is on baguette, not a huge roll.

The service is good and the desserts (at least the ice cream) tasty. 

We suspect the kinks in the dishes can be ironed out as the kitchen gets more experience."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.   The service was acceptable.   I found the menu extremely limited.   i.e.  there was no chicken on the menu.   I had stuffed quail that were quite good, if not a little difficult to eat.   The preparation was very good.   My dinner partner wanted soup.   There was none on the menu.   She ordered two vegetables instead and said they were excellent.   They were indeed beautiful.   The menu is strictly a la carte; entrees came with no side dishes of any kind.   This runs the price up substantially,   Entree and I side dish would be near $50 per person.   We did not have drinks. 

The building was attractive.   My biggest complaint was the noise.   There is nothing in the building to absorb sound.   It was so noisy in the early evening on a Saturday night that it was nearly impossible to carry on a conversation.   If it is always that noisy, I will not return."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have no experience with French restaurants, nor do I have any knowledge of the EXACT science behind what they're supposed to be like. 

Despite the aforementioned note, I LOVED Club Isabella. I think everything about it was satisfying and to my liking, though my martini could have been dirtier. 

We came here for our NYE celebration dinner and were immediately greeted by happy staff and an empty restaurant. This was a little intimidating and off-putting, since we expected it to be a little busier on a \"fancy date night\" that most people participate in as well as the \"iffy\" reviews I found on Yelp. Regardless, we live ~5 minutes walking distance from the place and I run by almost 5 times a week, so curiosity got the best of me. After debating on some fancy drinks, I went with a normal dirty martini. It was definitely not as dirty as I like them, but then again, I want to feel like I have an excuse to drink olive juice and not everyone understands that, so it was ok.

My boyfriend talked me into (well, it wasn't too hard, because for whatever reason, I was feeling adventurous--and, as he put it, it can't really ruin an entire year; we only had hours left!) frog legs for an appetizer. They were pretty tasty, though not my favorite things in the world. The sauce was fantastic, though, and Sharon, our server, prepared us with bread to soak it up. 

I had a lot of trouble deciding what to get. I was busy getting torn between the beef cheek ravioli and the tuna, meanwhile the special NYE menu sat neglected on the edge of the table. I realized my folly when I picked up the special menu and read \"filet\" (it was molasses and chili marinated...or something along those lines). My mind was made up! Last minute! 

The filet was perfection. It was cooked perfectly, the molasses sauce was delicious, the roasted scallions and beets were heavenly. It all melted in my mouth in an amazing blend creating one of the best meals I had all year. It definitely capped 2011 off in a lovely way. 

I tried the bf's steak and it wasn't as good as mine, we agreed. The asparagus side was a little weak, but it's not in season, so you can't blame the chef for poor supplies. The creamed spinach was good at first, but when we got to the bottom, it seemed extra salty--I'm not sure if this was a temperature thing, masking the salt at first, or if something settled. Overall, though, the meal was fabulous and definitely not disappointing. To finish, we got the tiramisu, which was tasty as well. 

I really liked Club Isabella. Though it's definitely not somewhere we will frequent, I'll reserve it for special nights and when my wallet is feeling a little \"too\" full (it is definitely a little pricey for someone like me)."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for a special meal and we ate here recently before a concert at Severance Hall. Always a delightful time with Marta as the hostess making sure all is running smoothly. I had the escargot special for an appetizer and my wife had the wedge salad with deep fried egg, both very good. My sole meunière was perfect and my wife enjoyed the lamb bolognese.  We plan to be back soon and often and enjoy the surroundings, service and great food."}
{"text":"If you have a special occasion, this is the place to go. There were seven in our party, and everyone loved their selection. The pianist was perfect for this warm, yet sleek, upscale space. I felt like I was somewhere in LA."}
{"text":"My friends and I came for a birthday lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the decor. The room was big and airy and full of great lighting. But that's pretty much where the pleasantries end.

The waiter was unattentive and frankly quite rude. The first incidence, he forgot my water when he served everyone else at the table. I chalked that up to a large number of people. Forgivable. Second time, he didn't take my order and proceeded to snatch my menu from me. Rude. Third time, he walked away as I handed him my check. Well, I thought maybe bad service was getting my meal comped, but apparently it's just a show of how bad service really can be. 

You would think that if you forgot a customer once, then twice, you might become a little better the third time around. Apparently, that's a no for Isabella staff. Business was not even booming, they were just not good! I was not the only one in my group to feel this way. When we first asked for our checks, our waiter stared at us and said, \"that will take me a while.\" There was only one other table in the restaurant. 

The food was alright but not worth the price. I basically got three fish sticks in tortilla for 15 dollars. Oh, they also threw in some apple slices. I think you could probably get almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went with friend to get drinks last week there-I recalled the original location by UH back when I was in college and had never stopped in, so I figured why not. It looked very inviting and hip. Decor was nicely done and modernized. Clientele was well dressed-more old than young. The drinks menu was decent in size and selection-I ordered a mango margarita and my counterpart a martini. We didn't eat but the food looked good that was coming outside to fellow diners. The patio area is spacious as well. The waiter was pretty friendly but a bit absent-minded-I realize that we came in toward night's end but forgetting our drink orders twice was a bit much."}
{"text":"Club Isabella it has been a while.  The last time I was there was pre-fire and new space.  I love the new space, it is open and the patio is lovely.  
It was my beau's birthday so we went post-art museum for a late dinner.  I was STARVING!  I ordered a cocktail, \"Pimm's Pink\" it was delish, but due to my crazy hunger I couldn't drink it until I had some food.  
Our waiter continued promising bread and finally it came.  The herbed butter for the bread was nice.  I ordered the scallops over cauliflower mash and my beau ordered a pasta dish with a side of Brussell sprouts.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, however so overly seasoned and crazy salty I didn't enjoy them.  I'm not sure why the chef felt the need to do this; if a scallop is good you need very minimal seasoning.  My beau's pasta was loaded w/ capers and what looked to be like tuna fish out of a can.  Really?  Canned Tuna?  The Brussel sprouts were an amazing explosion of flavor in my mouth, but I'm not sure what would have paired well with on the menu since they were so over-powering to everything else.
The service was S.L.O.W.  and not incredibly attentive.  Considering there were approximately 6 tables filled in the entire space, I felt the service was lacking.  The food was meh.  I might go back for a cocktail and the patio, but that is about it.  Club Isabella, you disappoint."}
{"text":"I was brought here for a business dinner and the ambiance was perfect for such an occasion. The place was nearly empty but the dinning room is a large open space which is clean and slightly modern but still warm and comfortable. 

We settled into a corner booth and the waiter was both professional and tactful. He was attentive but didn't rush the pace of the evening. He always approached cautiously as to not disturb conversation but was always there when needed. 

The food was fantastic. I had their take on the classic wedge, iceberg adorned with crunchy bacon, fresh tomatoes and draped with creamy blue cheese dressing. The braised short rib was fork tender and well paired with Thai peanut noodles. Fusion well executed. We had a nice Pinot noir to pair with the meal making for an overall exceptional experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an evening out with 4 friends. A+ experience. Little Italy gem. Great atmosphere, wonderful food and drink. Prepared to perfection. Piano on Friday nights. Great bar. Doug our waiter was exceptional. Parking available. Definitely going back*"}
{"text":"Went there when it first opened up - fantastic - then it went downhill fast.  Finally went back to see if things have changed, and they have for the better, and hope it continues because they are not there yet.  The food is good, but not great given the prices - in the non italian category they are competing with L'albatros and Washington Inn.  The big change is in their hospitality - the original manager is gone and they finally seem like they are truly trying to accomodate their clients.

The atmosphere is great - fun bar to sit at.  Had the Tuna entree.  The tuna was actually some of the best I have had, but this side of some kind of sauteed onions had a strange flavor and did not complement the entree.  We also shared the steak frites.  I believe it was flank - well prepared, thought for being flavored with a chimichurri sauce, it seemed under-seasoned.  The fries were nice, but a bit bland.

The bartender Sarah is awesome - seems like she is doing most of the work in the place - they really need to get their teamwork together.

All in all - a good place and hopefully will continue to get better.  Worth a try.  I truly hope they make it since I live in the neighborhood, its a really cool spot and it's great having options other than Italian food."}
{"text":"-Quick Review-
Rating: 3.5 stars 
Recommended dishes: pea ricotta ravioli and fish tacos 
Suitable for: business lunches, gathering with friends 

-Full Review-
I've been here twice, both weekday afternoons for lunch with friends. Here are my thoughts: 

//Parking//
There is a small lot in front of the restaurant, where you can park for free during lunch hours. I believe they charge $3 at night for valet parking though. To avoid paying for parking, look for street parking on Murray Hill road. 

//Ambience//
It's a modern and beautifully decorated restaurant with tons of paintings and fancy lights. Most everyone in this restaurant is middle aged or older, and dressed in business attire. My friends and I came here in jeans and sweatpants. We weren't kicked out, so good thing the dress code isn't enforced! :D 

//Food//
I came here for lunch, so the choice of food was pretty limited. The first time I came here, I tried their burger ($10-- it was the cheapest item on their menu!) and was thoroughly disappointed by it. The meat was dry and there just wasn't enough flavor to call it a gourmet burger. So I definitely do not recommend this! I tried some of my friend's fish tacos, and they were bombdiggity! I love the hoisin sauce it comes with. Way to mix Spanish and Asian flavors, Club Isabella :) The second time I was here, I tried the pea ricotta ravioli. HOLY COW THIS IS DERICIOUS! There was a whole mix of flavors in here. The Tarragon and Pernod Butter Sauce is TO DIE FOR! Sadly, there were only 4 raviolis for $16. Not filling at all, but still delicious! 

//Service//
Service was A-Ok. It wasn't the best or the worst I've had. The waitress didn't seem to enjoy her job very much though, but that's cool."}
{"text":"Amazing and personal service.  Food was great.  Had the Wedge and the Lamb Merguez Pizza.  Great cocktail menu too.  Would come back."}
{"text":"I came to Club Isabella on a Friday night for a work event, and I had a great time. The restaurant has an open layout, and it makes it feel like a grand place. It also sports an all black decor that comes off as quite elegant.

The staff at Club Isabella is lovely as well. They have a very family-like feel that I absolutely love. The bartender and servers were wonderfully accommodating.

Unfortunately, the food fell short. Admittedly, it was a limited menu, so I didn't get to try the exact things I wanted, but I still was disappointed. I did start with a negroni, which I thought was just ok. Definitely a sipper, and not an awful drink, but not a drink that made me excited for more.

The first course was the calamari: It was a good dish overall, and there were some lovely tomatoes in there that I thought were finely cooked. I wasn't thrilled by it, but it was nice to eat and definitely a pleasant starter. 

I also had a few slices of the vegetarian pizza, which was probably the best thing I ate for the entire night. The crust was crispy, and the entire thing was well cooked. The vegetables had great proportion, and the dish wasn't at all greasy. It was a great light starter.

It was followed by a kale and arugula salad. Now, don't get me wrong: the salad was good and well dressed. However, it was underwhelming. My expectation for a salad is that yes, it will have greens, but it will also have something more than greens. Tomatoes for me are a must, and some other vegetables are always appreciated. Perhaps some peppers? Mushrooms? Anything else? This was a boring dish, unfortunately.

Next was the main course. I had the scallops. Unfortunately, this dish fell flat. The sauce was overly sweet, and although the scallops were clearly well cooked, they were overwhelmed. A friend had asked specifically to have the scallops blackened. I tried a piece of his and it was far better, but the dish didn't come that way, so I unfortunately can't judge that part of the dish.

Finally, dessert was a chocolate cake with some chocolate-coffee frosting. I thought this part was mediocre. The cake was moist and rich, but the flavor was just off; perhaps it was that the coffee overwhelmed the rest of the dish. However, to be fair, I'm not a huge fan of coffee or espresso flavors, so it's not fair for me to let this affect my overall rating too much, so I tried not to count this in the rating.

Overall, a good but not great meal with fantastic staff and a lovely setting. I'll come back and order what I want and re-review."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Club Isabella. 

The bartender told us that the space was originally a guitar store that they gutted and completely renovated. The interior is a combination of contemporary rustic with brick detail in the corners and painted over exposed plumbing on the ceiling, and classic, with beautiful modern artwork and faux mini \"le creuset\" side dish bowls. 

The bar and food menu were fantastic. I order some sort of vanilla/citrus/maker's mark combination that was really well made. 

The food menu is decadent, with lots of butter, meat and cheeses. I was happy to see that they some local products. We tried a mushroom side that was flavorful, and definitely rich. I'd like to see some lighter, flavorful items added to the menu as well, but that doesn't seem to be what they are going for."}
{"text":"I ordered the scallops for my main course. They were way too salty and smothered in an unnecessary sauce. These were the worst scallops I've ever had at a restaurant. I've never been more disappointed. The waiter was shorty with us and quite rude. There are many better restaurants in the area. Needless to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My wedding rehearsal dinner was here and everything was deelish and the service was good. No complaints.  Everything was wonderful!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Club Isabella on New Year's Eve. We used to go to the old location years ago but this was our first trip to the new spot. Everything we had was phenomenal and our service was great. We both agreed that our dinner was the best meal we had in 2011 and it wasn't even close. Club Isabella is kind of expensive but, like everything in life, you get what you pay for. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a stark contrast to other establishments in Little Italy. First off, it's not Italian, and the decor is contemporary. atmosphere does not have any cues from Italy. Inside, you'll see large exposed dark wood beams that add a warm feel to the otherwise cold interior. It's quite a nice looking building from the outside as well. There's also a nice patio area next to the valet parking spaces. 

Anyhow, I wished this place tasted as good as its looks. We started the meal with the tartar trio sampler. Presentation on the appetizer was so-so. It was my first time having tartar, but my date had previous experiences with it. She thought it wasn't too bad, but I felt that the salmon tartar tasted like canned food. Perhaps I just don't know what it should taste. 

For the main course, I had the pork loin and she had the pan seared wolffish. The food took a while to arrive even though we were finished with the appetizer. However, the server was tentative and checked on us often. Finally the meals arrived. I was a bit let down by the size of the dishes. The pork loin couldn't have been bigger than 6 ounces. Same with her fish. Anyhow, my pork loin was a bit on the dry side and was too salty. The greens that came with the pork loin was nothing special.  However, the sauce that came with the pork loin wasn't too bad. The wolffish on the other hand was quite good, just wish there was more of it.  We ended with the dessert of the day, I don't remember what it was, so it couldn't have been extraordinary... 

Ending the night with a 3 digit bill for this quality of food is not acceptable. Save yourself and go around the corner for much better food!"}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT THE SAME OWNER AS THE OLD CLUB ISABELLA. My grandma was the owner of the original club Isabella and that place on bellflower. They stole the name."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this place is elegant and beautiful. Came on a Wednesday and the place was dead. The service was wonderful. The menu is limited, but had some delicious options. Tried the cavatelli, which was a large portion and had fresh ricotta on top. Also tried the breaded chicken that came with fresh greens/ tomatoes and a tasty dressing on top. Had an extensive wine list and fully stocked bar. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is fantastic.  Inventive without being gimmicky, immaculately prepared, and really, really tasty.  The decor and vibe are hip and cool too."}
{"text":"Im bumping this up to 3.

Their cuttlefish for lunch is amazing. Really well done with a spicy/sweet/tangy sauce... except the portion size is rather small. For like 10 bucks (including tip), this does NOT fill you up. 

I guess you could ask for more bread, haha (which is really good btw!)."}
{"text":"I am going to give this a 4.5 star review.  I have been here about 5-6 times with my wife.  The service has always been solid.  But, full disclosure, we usually go around Thursday/Weds night, so I am not sure how they handle a super busy saturday night.  Noticeably present this last time (thurs) was the owner.  Very friendly, urbane,  with a definite european accent (russian??), in her late 60's.  Came over to the table to check on everything without being intrusive.  
Now the restaurant.  One of the coolest vibes in Cleveland.  Looks more like L.A or NYC Meatpacking district design.  The wine list is solid and extremely reasonably priced.  The food, especially the apps, are outstanding.  Get the salmon tartare, one of the buns, split on entree and dessert, and you have a nice dinner.  Valet is available and very reasonably priced at $3.  So, what's not to like about this place. A very solid choice."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for an appetizer and glass of wine.  Server/owner gentleman was extremely rude and uninviting.  The restaurant was almost empty.  After looking at the appetizer offerings, and seeing the server/owner just glare at us from the bar; we decided to leave.  

Very uncomfortable environment.  Uninviting.  Unfortunately we have such fond memories of Club Isabella from years ago.  Definitely not the same place!"}
{"text":"Club Isabella, somewhat mysterious. Despite its name, it's not a club. Despite its Little Italy location, it's not an Italian restaurant. And, for these reasons, I am quite pleased.

Imagine a spacious and gorgeously modern atmosphere with music lightly playing on a baby grand piano. Eclectic and creative menu items like the steam buns and tartar trio sampler, difficult to resist.  Dynamic and impressive cocktails like the Bulleit Manhattan and Juniper Elderflower, just divine.

The perfect place for post-work drinks or late night eats and especially convenient while in the neighborhood for a Murray Hill art walk, concert at Severance Hall, event at the CMA or MOCA, etc. etc.

Gentlemen, take note: this would be a fine choice to wine and dine that special someone. 

Club Isabella is kind of like one of those best kept secrets that you don't necessarily want to share but would feel selfish doing so. It may not be so mysterious for much longer. . ."}
{"text":"Simply based on the coolness of a live pianist and the deliciousness of the shrimp fried rice replaced w quinoa this place deserves at least a 4.  They have reinvented their menu recently and Im not sure if the ratings will change given new items.  The swiss chard salad was okay, the salad tasted healthy but not amazing.  The tiramisu was just okay.  But my entree was fantastic.  Perfectly seasoned, excellent variety of textures and great quality large shrimp.  I love this dish so much I'm sure I'll be think about it in days to come.  Get the shrimp fried rice w quinoa you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice and the patio is great in the summer months. Problem areas include service and the food. We were a fairly large group (about 15) but the place was nearly empty and service was still super slow. At the end of our meal, the server informed us that the bill cannot be split (sigh, living in the Cleve has made me spoiled but ok that's fine)...the kicker was he could only accept up to two credit cards (seriously?!).

Cocktails are fine, but food is completely overpriced for the quality. Pizza was meh. I ordered mussels and for a lot of money I got a pitiful amount of mussels. What was most irksome was that I politely told our server that about 1/3 to 1/2 of the mussels were either closed and thus inedible or completely empty (and no mussel remnants were found in the broth). Come on, chefs! You should know you can't serve closed mussels and empty shells. Worst part was no one from the kitchen came to apologize. Womp. If I ever come back (doubt it) I'll only get a drink. Do yourself a favor and walk an extra 20 steps over to Washington Place Bistro."}
{"text":"Pretty big disappointment. The food was, at best, just fair and the service was worse. If you will notice, that seems to be a reoccuring theme in almost all of their reviews. They made the space look nice but that is about as positive as I can be for CI"}
{"text":"I just had one of the best dinners I have eaten in Cleveland in recent memory.  Everything was way beyond my expectations.  The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable.  The wine list accessible and varied.  Every bite of food was delicious, creative and beautifully presented.  The patio was lovely and the dining room warmly lit and welcoming. The chef greeted us and was as warm and friendly...as if he were welcoming us into his own home.  We will be back at our first opportunity."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem
In Little Italy! Great service, absolutely delicious food and calm ambiance!  Went with good friends who have raved about it and they have never had a bad dinner there. 
They were right! Now one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving to this spot the valet attendant approached me sweating, telling me that he could not park my car...that there were just too many cars he was parking. Luckily, I was just getting dropped off, but I was still taken aback. 

Aside from that I entered the restaurant with an open mind. The interior had great decor and was really nice. I was excited to try something new.

I was meeting some friends who were still making their way to dinner so I headed to the bar for a cocktail. 

Although the bar was not really crowded, the bartenders seemed very flustered. The drink that I ordered was the worst Moscow Mule that I have ever had. I did complain and they attempted to improve it, but it still wasn't up to par. I handed the bartender a $100 bill and she looked confused and annoyed and asked me if I had anything smaller.

My first girlfriend arrived and told me that the valet attendant greeted her in the same fashion. When the rest of our party arrived one of the ladies approached the bar and the bartender flat out said \"I can't serve you...I just can't. We have a lot of tickets coming in from the dining room.\" The restaurant had many tables open and one rather large party, but something that should have been manageable. She flagged the other bartender down and ordered two dirty martinis. The drinks were served in wine glasses!!! It was really awful!

We decided that the service might be better if we sat down at our table. We were greeted by the waitress who told us she would be right back with water. 10 minutes later when she didn't come back we decided to walk out! 

It is a shame that this is such a nice space because the service could potentially put them out of the business. I will not be recommending this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for happy hour/dinner. The food and drinks were quite good (cabbage pizza and sangria), but the service was terrible. When no servers came around to the table, I had to ask the hosts if I could order a drink, to which they responded that I should ask the server outside who had not been to the table for the past 10 minutes. After receiving the pizza, I noticed that the bacon was missing from it and mentioned it to our waitress - I never got an answer back about why there was no bacon, or an apology for the mistake."}
{"text":"I want to say up front that the only disppointing element of this place was the loud trains passing by while we ate outside. Beyond that, everything was great. I tried the tar tar sampler of tuna, salmon, and steak and it was amazing! It came with a fried egg which I haven't seen before but it was the perfect touch. My date loved the bread pudding dessert.

The ambiance (outside of the train) is beautiful and comfortable. It feels as if it was designed by a professional interior designer, and the outdoor seating is well done too with an overhead canopy and finished stone flooring. 

This was my second visit here and I was not disappointed. A few of the reviewers here seem to be disappointed with the price. This is a well done French restaurant, not a budget chinese stop, so I don't understand what they expected. If I'm going to eat raw meat (tar tar) I want to know there is a clean kitchen and a professional chef and I expect higher prices. Who is going to eat raw meet from a $2 burger shop? 

DO plan on parking valet OR use Uber/Lyft. It is very difficult find parking on a weekend. The restaurant itself has never been crowded, it is just a very difficult area to park being so close to both Case and Little Italy."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour. Even though we sat at the bar, it took them 15 minutes to acknowledge us. The cocktails were pretty good but the pizza was just meh."}
{"text":"Everything was great...from start to finish. Wedge salad with fried egg is the best I've ever had.  Chef Fabio came to the table and made some great recommendations for entrees. We had the shrimp fried rice and the size of the shrimp was staggering.  Atmosphere was casual, yet elegant (live piano on Friday).  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We spent our New Year's eve here and had an incredible time!!

Started the night with some drinks and a soy glazed sirloin Chinese steamed bun, that just evaporated moments after arrival. We then shared the Black Sea Bass atop a deconstructed Lobster Thermidor. The Black Sea Bass was cooked perfectly as every bite just melted away, the Lobster Thermidor was exquisite and left me with deep sleep awakening dreams in the following days and maybe weeks.

We toasted in the new year with a glass flute of superb and complimentary Champagne, no plasticware here! And then rounded out the night enjoying the blissful jazz that Club Isabella is known for.

If you can get a reservation this is destination numero uno for your New Year's Eve celebration!!!

On another note if you find yourself in the area for happy hour the cuttlefish is a must have, or if you're feeling a little less daring try the General Tso's, both are amazing. I haven't tried any of the pizza's but believe me they are next on my list!

Finally, on the several occasions I've been here the service has always been attentive and professional."}
{"text":"I have been here several times...and have not been disappointed...it's a bit of a more upmarket addition to little Italy. Sometimes I have come after work, for their happy hour (until 6 PM), where you can order Pizza (proper Italian thin crust) for half the price and get good wine by the glass for $5. Outdoor seating is great in the summer, and the indoor decor in contemporary and very stylish. For dinner I can recommend the short ribs and the Sirlion. I am yet to try the Pacu fish (Amazonian fish, almost like a piranha), but they have been out of stock every time I order it. It's a little pricey but worth checking out."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the first time last night. That will be the last time. Had to flag down our waiter when it wasn't even busy to get overpriced drinks. The salads were laughable. To say overpriced is an understatement. The scallops were marginal and visually unappealing. My wife enjoyed her beef cheek ravioli but one of them was refrigerator cold. It's a beautiful place but no piano player on a Saturday night? The place is way overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Yep this wasn't the best. The sign said closed, the lights were off and the parking lot was chained off. Those should have been three major \"DO NOT GO HERE\" signs. After calling, the owner said \"there isn't a sign saying we are closed, we're open\" so we walked back. As we get to the door, he is walking out and changes the sign to open. Awkward. We go in, no music no lights on, no one in the restaurant. Weird. The bartender comes over smelling very strongly of cigarette smoke and takes our drink orders, which takes an extremely long time seeing there is NO ONE ELSE THERE. Drinks were okay. Check time came, we cashed out and peaced out. The 1 hour we were there, only one table came in to eat. Signs point to no for this one. I felt like we were on bar rescue or some hidden camera show... had high hopes but left without much."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant in the area. I still love the ambience but our last visit there the food was a little below par. Over salty and a little high-priced. Perhaps it was just that night - but if not please take a look at your menu and your methods - this place is too good to lose!"}
{"text":"Skip it 2!
Yes, the place looks nice, it;s a darn shame that the service is TERRIBLE. We've been there twice, and it was the same bad experience each time, although the food second time was much better than the first.  Both times it took us at least 15 minutes to get noticed by anyone after being seated and about a half hour to get a glass of wine.  Our waitress was really sweet, but she never offered us bread and  after the food came, nobody bothered to ask if all was o'k.  Then we could not get anybody to give us salt, which one dish desperately needed and, finally, we had to ask 3 times for our leftovers.  Sadly, neither the waitress nor the management thought to make up for endless waiting and general inattentiveness by at least offering me that measly 4 oz glass of wine on the house.
Disappointed!  I hope they fix the problems as I wish for them to succeed.

{"text":"Came here for a Medical Dinner. Loved the place. Great Service, Outstanding Steak & Delicious Pot de Crème. Cabernet had a bit of residue but the Steak was so good that I'm giving 5 stars. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely a neighbourhood gem! We came for Saturday dinner. Great atmosphere with live piano and complimentary valet. Attentive service. Drinks and food were both delicious but both entrees were just a bit too salty. Overall a wonderful evening and we'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"2* for food, 4* for ambiance ... I guess I'll be nice and average it to 3.  This place is more pleasing to the eye than to the tummy.  And that, for me, is a disappointment.

I was soo glad when the bf and I saw this place, right in the perfect location, with great evening hours.  We walked in, it looked fancy, the menu looked appetizing.  The bartender greeted us right away as we walked in... the piano man was playing... the ambiance was quiet, romantic, comfortable, and modern.  I loved it!

Then it went all down hill from there.  I ordered the duck confit.  I love duck confit, I order it a lot.  Well... if I ever go back here, I'll get something else.  It was dry - like sat under a heat lamp dry.  And it was super salty.  I gave it to my bf to finish (he has a saltier preference than I do).  He ordered the flank steak.  They didn't ask how he wanted it cooked, which is typically not a problem for him because he likes medium rare to medium (which is exactly what most restaurants serve).  It came out over-cooked (even for his taste) and salty.  I guess the kitchen here really really likes their salt.  It can mask mediocre quality ingredients and cook to just season the heck out of things... maybe that's the strategy.

The wine was good.  If I come back, it'll likely be to sit around, drink, and chat.. not for dinner.  But maybe I'm being too harsh and it was just an off night.  Maybe other things on the menu are better.  Likely I won't really have a chance to find out unless someone wants to try it out, or there's some event I attend here.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Yum! Club Isabella hasn't disappointed me yet! Their menu is a bit eclectic but everything I have tried has been good. My husband had the lamb burger and it was very good!  I had a pizza which was good but not excellent.  They also have a great drink menu that you should definitely check out.  The outdoor patio is a must in the warm weather!!"}
{"text":"This place has a really nice atmosphere. During the summer- or warm months, if you can sit outside, do it! There is a nice outdoor patio. I've come here for dinner s few times. The food is pretty good. I can't remember the name but the breaded chicken with the horseradish salad is my favorite dish that I get every time. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because it's kind of expensive. About $35-$50 a person depending if you get drinks or not."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, lovely crafted cocktails and excellent service. Ribeye with risotto was perfectly cooked and presented. The ribeye was fork tender, pink and juicy. The risotto was a lovely texture. The ginger smash cocktail was a great mix of flavors tangy,spicy with a slight sweetness.

Club Isabella's atmosphere is intimate and modern."}
