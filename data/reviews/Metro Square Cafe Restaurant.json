{"text":"Awesome little Hong Kong style restaurant with really quick service. They just renovated so the interior looks nicer than typical Kong Kong style food restaurants. It's located at the corner of Metro beside Gong Cha! Turn left when coming in from side-street. 8am - 10pm, cash only. Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and local. Don't expect high end quality food or fancy service. This place is what I call an authentic hk cafe."}
{"text":"I drove by this place and felt like trying it, since Hong Kong-style steakhouse food is not that commonplace.  I walked in with just modest expectations and was quite pleasantly surprised, and since then I kept going back and became more and more impressed.  The first time I was there, I ordered the assorted steaks/chops entree.  It's already a big dish, but I hadn't known that they give you buttered toast, soup *and* a very well made salad on top of it, with the salad including potatoes, fruit, lettuce as well as a substantial amount of ham.  The meats in the entree weren't uniformly great -- the pork chop was a bit stale tasting, and the sausage is terrible -- but most of it was delicious, with the chicken and beef being extremely well seasoned and tender.  I've since done something I rarely do, whcih is go back several times a week while trying a different thing each time.  They have an \"African-style\" spicy chicken that's something I've never seen anywhere else.  It's a large, firm chicken steak, but the flavour is the special part, a great tangy, hot, yet also sweet concoction.  I had the baked ox tongue with spaghetti for lunch on another visit and it was excellent.  Another time I tried the bargain meals from a menu with mostly items under $8; the spaghetti in soup with beef was above average, and the meal also came with two breakfast eggs with ham, all for under $7.  The sizzling plate with salmon and beef was also quite good, though the salmon wasn't a tail so it had quite a few bones in and was a bit fishy, but acceptable.  I've never had any fried pork cutlet anywhere that merited mention, but this one does -- two huge slabs, with a perfect balance between crispy exterior and moist, tender interior, and a mayonnaise-like sauce that complements very well.  And the Thai fried rice with prawns is one of the best fried-rice dishes I've ever had; its price tag is a bit high, but it's extremely flavourful, the portion is large, and not only do you get delicious grilled prawns (for an extra fee), but also what seems to be Chinese BBQ pork included.  The prices at this place are much more in line with the huge bargains people from Hong Kong are used to.  The decor is very good, and the serving staff is pleasant and fairly efficient.  Extra points for the visual presentation of the food.  The photos on this Yelp page do not do this place justice; there definitely seemed to be special care in making the dishes look as good as they taste."}
{"text":"For $6.50 I guess their Shrimp Won Ton noodle soup with beef brisket was decent. However soup was flavourless/water and brisket was quite fatty if you like that. Noodles were the supersoft/overdone round rice noodle. For a busy HK Cafe it fell short of my expectations"}
{"text":"0.5 star for one of the waiter (or owner?)  Arrived around 630. Restaurant was not too busy. One waitress came over the take our order but left us without asking what we want for soup and drink even tho clearly we ordered two dinner sets. And guess what it's Because she needed to get the steak order to the other guests' table. How rude.   A waiter came over (I believed he may be the owner), finished off our order and offer the give us extra soup if I wanted.   Got my order round 715pm (45mins later). Even the table who came in after us got their dishes. I normally don't really care the order of the food too much because I know different foods prep and cook differently. but that guy ordered the same thing we ordered and he got the order before me somehow. Like, wth.   The worst of all?? Our order supposed to come in a sizzling plate (we ordered the ones recommended by yelpers here), and both my orders come in a really bad looking plates instead for of sizzling plates. Our steak and chicken were cold before we even started enjoy it. WTH!!   All other guest have two plates each, and we have three people and got two plates in total. Nobody really cares even tho we were sitting right in front of waitress area (where they hang out), I had to ask for a bowel for my kid after meaningless waiting for them to take notice.   I ordered two of the relatively high priced items in this restaurant, if you ran out the sizzling plate, how about asked us if we are willing to change to normal plate before doing so for me without even mention it???  The money I paid for this meal definitely well spent considered the two cold plates we had. Both beef and chicken tasted really weird. Sirloin beef had a strange strong taste to it that almost made me hesitate to eat it.  So pissed. First time ever I could barely finish 1/4 of the dish I ordered. And beware they don't have breakdowns when they handed you the bill, one and only one number is there. the total, no details on how much each plates are and any extra charges (e.g.  drinks), nothing!! When asked to get a proper receipt, they brought out a piece (serious a tiny strip of paper) and wrote down my total.  That's it. WTH?   Will NOT!!! go back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for delicious hong kong style food. When i go, i often get the baked rice combos. I have also tried their filet mignon combo and they are definitely worth the price ($14.99) since the portions are massive, not only that, it comes with salad/drink/soup!!!! I get the mignon them when i am super hungry. The service is often very good and the menu has so many options that it often take my family a while to decide what to get. The restaurant is also situated in a plaza with ample parking spaces. I just had dinner here tonight too. I had a baked pork rice casserole and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wifey & I ordered a bor low yow (pineapple bun with butter) and ginger and onion chicken steak with lo-instant noodle.  Decor was modern for a hk style cafe, great job with the food pictures on the menu and the walls. Slightly tight but generally family friendly.  Food tasted decent, the only knock really was that it was too salty. I guess that's why it was so flavorful. Portion was small for the price in my opinion. The milk tea that came with it was very good as well.  Food came quick. Also they take cash and debit only.  Will return"}
{"text":"Worst HK cafe I have been to in GTA!! And I actually got this account just to write a review!!!  1)Bad service!!! The waitress was not interested to take our orders and rushed to take the menu away!!  2)Bad food!!! It's the most red and watery Russian  Borscht soup I've ever had!!!The curry beef brisket was cold and the pork chop macaroni tasted like microwaved food!!WTH??? 3)The only reason I gave one star because I couldn't give 0!!!!  Never coming back again!!! SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. But my boyfriend ordered beef with rice and I got chicken wings and fries. When my boyfriend got his meal, the beef was raw, and sort of soggy looking? nd then I got my meal half an hour later and honestly I only got it because it looked presentable and appetizing in the picture. The French fries were hard and stuck together and the chicken wings were okay. But 15 mins in I got the worst stomach ache. Overall, you could just tell our food was not fresh and it was frozen."}
{"text":"When you give notice to a Resto as such your list of allergens to avoid, they agree to provide & assure you that I will be content after my meal, but you return with a full onslaught body rash of symptoms, who do you really blame now. Your self as the consumer who took a chance of the resto's genuine honesty/dishonesty/ RESTAURANTS' kitchen CARELESSNESS ( since most all kitchen help staff lack perfect/any English or understanding of current events ) Go figure?!"}
{"text":"I go here any time I'm in the mood for a good, cheap meal. Meals come with soup and drink and will set you back around $10 including tax. I usually get the baked chicken in either a la king style or with cheese and tomato sauce on rice. Portions sizes are just right with a generous amount of meat. The soup today was tasty and even had a few mussels in it. The HK milk tea was too watered down this time but we left the restaurant with a good impression overall."}
{"text":"One of my favourite HK-style cafes, decent to somewhat pricy for a Chinese cafe but has decent, yummy food and good combos (usually includes drink&soup&salad, can choose either noodles/rice).  When I went there with my friends, they didn't seem to like it much, but maybe that's just because none of them quite liked Cantonese food.  The service is usually pretty fast/not too slow.   For dinner I'd recommend the baked cheesey shrimp. :)"}
{"text":"Bad service. Waitress was rude and impatience. Bad food...looks nothing like the picture on the menu. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my family at around 11:00 and it was a bit crowded. We waited for around 10 minutes before sitting down. The restaurant is decorated very nicely with large pictures on the wall with tinsel and Christmas ornaments dangling from the ceiling. The seating was a bit cramped, but it's alright if you're not planning on staying for long. I ordered the exotic meal which included a toast with butter and condensed milk and a macaroni in soup with abalone, ham, and chicken. I also had a cold water with sugar and lemons. The waitress took our order very quickly and our orders came quickly as well. The food tasted as expected of a Hong Kong styled brunch restaurant(Cha Chan tang) and wasn't exceptionally good. That isn't to say that the food was not good. I enjoyed my macaroni very much and was happy with my experience. I would think of coming back again."}
{"text":"By grace that I have a morning off today and am able to enjoy a relaxing breakfast. My husband suggested this cafe which we had not been for almost a decade. The restaurant still existed but the interior decor is no longer the same and it is less crowded as well compared to about 10 years ago.   beef tendon and brisket with rice noodle in soup (score 4/5)  a cup of milk tea and coffee mixed (score 5/5)   Ordered a beef tendon and brisket with rice noodle in soup and a cup of milk tea and coffee (mixed). The bowl of noodle is pretty big. I have been having a hard time to finish the whole bowl of noodles. The taste of the soup was good but in terms of meat, there were more beef tendons than beef briskets. There only two hunks of briskets and I preferred to  have more briskets than beef tendons. The bowl of noodle also comes with some greens on the side.  The cup of milk tea and coffee mixed was super. I have to give a compliment for that. It was smooth and creamy and yet the balance of milk, tea, and coffee was in good ratio. I could taste each of them in my tastebuds. Definitely will come back for tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Inside Metro Square Plaza at the west corner facing Steeles.   After a slight renovation it looks a bit more modern but the menu barely changed. They added some fancier and westernized items like garlic prawns and beef tenderloin, scallop and sirloin steak, etc.   The food is not that amazing. Their combo soups taste like nothing and had no bits inside to chew on, pure liquid. The Hong Kong style milk tea is not as good as before. The combo prices typically range from$5 to $8.   For a cheap filling this place is okay, but if you expect good tasty food, I wouldn't suggest this place. The service is average I asked for a dessert (French Toast w/ Ice Cream), the server dropped the plate but I had no forks. The table was empty I had to ask for forks. Not the brightest or attentive server.  They have Wi-Fi available. The password is hongkongtea.  Overall I rate this place 2 out of 5 because this place just didn't impress me. I wouldn't purposely come be k for their food."}
{"text":"Pretty good hk style cafe, good variety of food and servers were helpful and prompt. We came here as a table of 5 on a Saturday so the restaurant was pretty busy. I had the hainanese chicken rice, which I enjoyed. Good portion size/value and chicken was done pretty well. My friends' dishes were all pretty generously portioned and they all seemed to like it as well.   Their milk tea was really good, which is always important to me. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This is a very good HK style cafe. I've came here once for breakfast and it was packed. It's fairly good value for what you pay for. I came today for their afternoon tea specials that start under $3. I ordered a corn beef and egg sandwich and a coffee for 3.99.  The coffee was actually very good. They also have many other items that are inexpensive and looks very good but I just wanted a snack. I'm going to make sure I come back again to try their other combos.  The service was also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that one of my favourite types of restaurants is a HK café. My staple dish is satay beef with vermicelli noodles. However, Metro Square café does not do this dish justice. The meat is a hard texture and the satay sauce falls off the meat, so the meat doesn't absorb the flavour.  Satay beef: 1/5  However, their egg sandwiches and milk tea are bomb. The egg is moist and buttery and delicious. The bread is soft and sweet, and the whole combination of the sandwich makes it worth coming to this restaurant. The milk tea is just the perfect balance of creaminess and is a slightly higher quality than other cafes.  Egg sandwich + Milk Tea: 5/5  Overall, I wouldn't order anything else here except for the egg sandwich and milk tea. The egg sandwich on its own makes my review of this restaurant a 4 star."}
{"text":"BEST egg sandwiches EVER!! Believe me, I've tried many Toronto HK style cafes and this place tops them all on egg sandwiches AND HK style milk tea. Their egg sandwiches are soft, fluffy and juicy. Milk tea is consistently rich and flavorful. I've been an avid customer since its opening and they have never failed to impress  Recommendations: egg sandwich, milk tea, HK style curry chicken rice and their stone plate dinner sets (steak, fish fillet)!"}
{"text":"Authentic Hong Kongnese cafe. The hk style tea is very smooth. Food was ok. The place is very trendy and it's nicely decorated with a giant pic of HK one one side and yummy food on the other. I have their 5 spices sweet corn rice noodles that were delicious."}
{"text":"I like the milk tea there.  The food is not bad but the portion is small.  One thing that really bugs me is that the bill they presented did not have a break down.  It has a total amount and that's it, hand written.  I think it's their way of getting a bit more money from the customer, thinking that we would not notice.  My bill says $26.  And it was really $25.46 including HST.  I couldn't believe that they rounded up!!!  So dishonest!!!  I would go back but word of advice, do your calculation and don't get ripped off.  Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my buddy who lived in the area. It's a cantonese \"fast food\" place with lots of price friendly items. I ordered a milk tea and a pineapple bun with butter. My buddy got a full meal and by the time he finished eating his meal, my pineapple bun was nowhere to be found. So I asked the server about my missing order and was informed that they ran out of pineapple buns. Okay, you could have told me that when I ordered. At least the milk tea was good. However, just after I asked the question, the server came and slammed our bill on the table. I've been to many similar Chinese/cantonese establishments and this was definitely definitely on the rude side of things. Sorry, even good milk tea would not convince me to come back here."}
{"text":"I would give 0 star if it's an option. Came in second time. NO BODY serve or get u to table. Not even say hi to me for leaving me standing at entrance for 10 MINUTES. After I talked to two servers for asking a table. One female staff came and write me a number to wait for table. With freezing face lol. But there is one four seats table available right beside the bar. I feel so \"WELCOME \"here.  The staff are so \"Friendly\" that I feel I OWE their money. By the way I tried grilled chicken with noodle last time it's very salty and it obviously contain a lot of glutamate."}
{"text":"A good option for HK style cafe lunch or snack.  Most meals come with complementary soup and a hot drink.  Fan of their daily soups."}
{"text":"So I just finished my afternoon tea for 6$. I got a club sandwich which came with fries and milk tea! What a deal! What I like about this place is although they get busy they don't neglect the customers, no mater how small their order! Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I like it here! Service is great and the dishes I have had here were consistently good, like the baked Portuguese chicken on spaghetti and the mac and cheese... Yum! The spaghetti in meat sauce wasn't as good as the one at Yogi Noodle, but then again, Phoenix's spaghetti in meat sauce isn't as good as Yogi's either. Anyway, I will definitely be back and am looking forward to trying the seafood and chicken a LA king with cream sauce next time!"}
{"text":"The service is Hong Kong Style, the decor has been renovated and the menu has been upgraded to more varieties.  I like the owner he is very friendly and greet the customers extra warm. I am glad this store location remains unchanged and even it is actually getting better options from the menu.   The milk tea quality has not change to be worse. It remains the same quality like before. Price has gone up reasonably.   If you like speedy service and HK style milk tea it is definitely a place."}
{"text":"My go to spot for takeout since its beside my office & on my way to work! Quick , easy & consistent food quality. Come here if you need an inexpensive hk cafe style meal. Addicted to drinking their lai cha (milk tea) as my regular caffeine fix."}
{"text":"It's not a bad place if you're craving HK style food. Brings me back to yonder years when as a teenager I used to eat the HK set lunch/dinner combos almost everyday. Even with inflation, it's still a good deal!  For $16.99 I ordered the sizzling plate steak combo B: steak, chicken and fish. Mister ordered Combo A $15.99: lamb and fish. Both combos served with corn and broccoli.  You can choose a side of rice or spaghetti. You have 4 options for the type of sauce they use. Included with the meal is your choice of chinese or western style soup, Asian potato salad, and a choice of a hot or cold beverage.  You'll definitely be put into a food coma afterwards."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast today. There was not as many patrons as usual because of the wet weather. I don't usually come on weekends because there is always a really long line up for tables. Today, we waited for 5 minutes.  We ordered our foods and they came out really fast, as usual. We ordered 4 of the all day breakfast specials. My daughter got the spaghetti and bacon in soup with toast, 2 eggs, sausage and ham. That was only $6.50 including hot drink. My son got the satay beef vermicelli with an egg sandwich. My brother got the instant noodles with ham and egg and 1 piece of condensed milk brick toast. I ordered the beef tendon and brisket soup rice noodle. All our food and drinks were good. I like that this cafe does serve breakfast items after 11am, as we don't always make it before 11 am, especially at the weekend. We have tried some of the other foods before and they were quite good too. It looks nicer too now, after their recent reno."}
{"text":"Just a quick update: So I came here just to grab a quick bite. We were seated quickly, even though the restaurant was 80% full. After browsing the menu, we've decided what to order. However, when the wait-staff came to take our order, I said baked cream of corn with fish on rice casserole AND no cheese. I repeated myself again after. And my order came out not long after... WITH cheese. I meant I ate it. Just these little things can be a make or break a good place to a not very good place. Rating for overall experience has dropped to a 3 out of 5, or even a 2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I always go to this place when I was I Toronto. It was just cross street of my house before. Everything is changed now, food are cheaply made, taste too salty. I don't know what happened. The waitress just forgot about our order or something, we waited at least an hour for the food, and reminded them several times. I don't think we will go back again..."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times now. For a Hong Kong style diner, the food is good and very affordable. I normally come here for breakfast/brunch. My favorite item on their all day special menu is the Satay Meal. You get a drink (Hong Kong milk tea!!!), a sandwich (egg sandwich - so far this place makes it the best out of similar places I have been to), and a noodle dish. In my opinion, this is a great place to come to for a quick breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced food, & a variety of delicious dishes, fast & efficient service, friendly wait staff, and newly renovated clean surroundings! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch to have their all day specials, but decided to come here for dinner tonight, a bit more time and less rushed.  They are definitely not as busy during dinner compared to lunch.   I must have not been here in a while because it looks like they renovated the place.  They now have pretty graphics on the wall with suggestions of what to eat, and pictures of some dishes on the posts.   I ordered a Hoi Nam chicken rice as I saw the picture on the wall and it looked nicely presented.  For $7.50 including soup and a drink, I found it at a great deal.  The two sauces were very flavourful, the rice had a good chicken taste.  The only downfall I found was that most of the places I have gone to have the chicken bones removed. This dish had all the bones in there, and they were broken up too, so had to be careful while I was eating it.   I enjoy having their daily special with instant noodle and protein with 2 eggs, and condensed Milk toast for 6.50!  Overall cannot complain too much because the prices are very reasonable and the quality is pretty good!! Great place if you're craving some hk afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Typical hongkong style place. Some dishes are good, some dishes are bad. Generally bland. But really cheap nonetheless.  Their corned beef sandwich tastes great, it could use more meat, as there was more toast than meat..  And when I tried their sizzling steak, I was not impressed at all. The steak and chicken were so bland. The $9.99 whole dinner set was a huge meal, but it extremely lacks taste. You get what you pay for in this place.."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for two things.   First is their pork cutlet set dinner. It's $10.99 and comes with soup (choice between two dailies), salad (not your typical Chinese potato salad thing), garlic bread (cheap but delicious), two huge, juicy, crispy pieces of pork cutlet, rice or spaghetti, veggies, ice cream (usually topped with shredded coconut), and hot drink (I like the ovaltine). I like to choose the black pepper sauce with my dinner. This is enough for two people. Soup and garlic bread used to be be unlimited. Not sure if that's still the case. Ah. Tip for those like me who aren't particularly into salad. For a dollar or two more, you can change your salad to chicken wings. The chicken wings are delicious. I'm a huge fan of pork cutlets, and I'd have to say that this place has the best ones. They're spot on every time. They're also like $3.99/piece if you order them individually.  Second thing is any of their baked rices/spaghetti's. Most Chinese places make their baked rices by sticking them in the oven a while and letting the sauce develop that skin-like layer on top/brown a tad. Metro Square Cafe Restaurant puts cheese on it and lets the cheese bake away. It's mouthwatering. If other restaurants use cheese, it's not nearly as much cheese as this place puts on. Their fried rice base for their baked rices is also really good.   One interesting thing to note about this place. They put eggplant in their curry. Unique, but delicious."}
{"text":"This place is just like any other HK cafe.  Do not expect food to be exceptional ... It is descent and it fills you up.  When you come here for food, just have that mentality that it is just like another fast food restaurant.    The ambiance is good because they recently renovated the space.    They have breakfast specials going to 11am and a lunch menu and all day menu.  It seems like the recently increased prices on their food items as I see stickers taped over the old prices."}
{"text":"I always come to this Cafe or New City for breakfast.  This Cafe has one of the best milk tea in Toronto, it's very smooth and the amount of tea flavours is perfect!  Beside their delicious milk tea, they also have a wide variety of breakfast choices.  My go to breakfast is the Pick 2 toppings with macaroni and a butter sandwich.  For my 2 toppings, 90% of the time I choose Satay Beef with Red Sausages as their Satay sauce has the right amount of spiciness and when mixed with the macaroni with soup, it tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"I guess this place isn't good for dinner/lunch entrees. Afternoon tea is okay. Ordered the seafood wharf man chow mein and baked steak with rice. Chow mein was a small portion and the seafood tasted straight out of a can or just not that good lols. It came with one mussel LOL and the mussel had a sandy taste (had to spit it out). Steak with gravy, rice and corn was ok. They got our order wrong as we wanted the steak with spaghetti...and then they charged us for asking to put our drinks in takeout cups...soup that came with the meal was also watered down....probably will only be back for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"I know this place has been here for quite a while but never really had this in mind whenever I ever went uptown. Surprisingly this place looked renovated,  not sure if newly renovated or what not but seemed refreshed or modernized. They have this menu wall paper which is a neat idea and the restaurant itself is clean and spacious.  It is busy so it definitely isn't a bad HK Cafe. The menu has it's variety and from what I recall most meals include a drink and price starts at $6. The items ordered were a spaghetti with fish in a cream sauce and a baked pork chop rice.  I liked how the tomato sauce with the pork chop rice had fresh tomatoes.  The fish item was alright,  but would not be something I would order again.  Usually, I would order a hot milk tea but this time wanted a yin yang (tea and coffee mix)- it was not bad.   Food and drink wise I would say were okay.  I would need to come again.. Perhaps their simple sandwich items"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this HK style cafe for some time now. The cafe is situated just 2 blocks west of Warden and Steeles, at Metro Square (as the name already suggests). It is always busy during lunch hour, so I recommend coming in before 11am/after 1pm.... otherwise, be prepared to line up out the door. I came here specifically for their HK French toast and HK milk tea, as I had a craving for HK style breakfast that's not dim sum.  After waving the waitress over and ordering my food off the menu, I realized she barely understood any English. She only spoke Cantonese. This might be a disadvantage to the non-Chinese speakers. So, I repeated my order to her but in Cantonese. I specifically requested my French toast with condensed milk. The other options were peanut butter, jam and butter. Even though I ordered in Cantonese, my French toast came with butter instead of the condensed milk I asked for. I guess I could've told her to send it back to the kitchen, but the butter was already gradually sinking on to the toast , so I kept it. It was still very good! My disappointment quickly diminished and I devoured the toast. If you come here, get ready to brush up your Cantonese skills or get ready to point at food pictures."}
{"text":"I love a chinese cafe that will put butter and condensed milk on your toast (with the crust cut off!). Prices are cheap and they have a wide range of things to order. Their all-day menu never disappoints! I love that each menu item comes with a different side of toast/sandwich - one may include toast with butter and condensed milk, another may include an egg sandwich or corned beef sandwich. Tons of variety!"}
{"text":"Super cheap HK fare -- keep in mind they seemed to have raised their prices some time in March 2018 (almost everything on the menu has gone up by 40 cents compared to the photos of the menu I took back in February 2018).  I find that some of the dishes are hit/miss, depending on what you order... example, yunnan pork with vermicelli is a sad amount of yunnan pork (looked like it was half a can of this meat you can get in a supermarket) and not enough food for one person.  There was a lamb chop menu option that doesn't seem to be there anymore but the portions were good.  Black pepper sauce steak is a thin slice of steak but it was very chewy.  You get what you pay for..."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a -1 star review but since this option is not available so I have to give 1 star :(  Called them earlier today to order take out, as they answered the phone coincidently I was sneezing as she said hi, she then immediately said \"don't play joke with me what do u need I am very busy!!!\" I was extremely shocked to hear this from her as clearly I wasn't playing joke with her nor I had the time to do that I just wanted to order some food.  She totally killed my mood and I decided to not order from them, there are plenty of take out options in town and I don't think I deserve this kind of attitude.... :("}
{"text":"I only come here for breakfast - egg sandwich with oatmeal and milk tea.  This HK-style cafe has the best egg sandwiches - fluffy, moist egg and soft bread. You can substitute wheat bread, but I think it tastes better with the original white bread. The sandwich itself is about $3. Breakfasts start at $3.99."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite HK style cafes to frequent, as I often like to get the breakfast items as a light dinner. They have set breakfast meals available all day featuring a combo of macaroni/spaghetti, eggs, toast and/or sandwiches, and the typical meal drink. They also have a large variety of rice or noodle options for dinner.  The milk tea and lemon tea are pretty good and the prices affordable."}
{"text":"Dinner is okay, afternoon tea is expensive and smaller than expected portions. 7.99 I expect more than 4 small wings and fries.  Large variety of food though"}
{"text":"Newly renovated for 12 years anniversary.  Free wifi, unlimited soup and garlic bread on dinner sets 10% off your bill until further notice.  Food portion is awesome, order a filet mignon with two big pieces.  I end up talking half home for next day.  $14.99 comes with a sizzling plate, drink, salad, spaghetti or rice and unlimited soup & garlic bread.  Is definitely a steal in Markham!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a much lively with great food.  However, in the 2 years it's been going downhill, the food still tastes good, but the fact of skimming ingredients and serving undercooked food seems to be a habit now.  I ordered the curry beef brisket and fried chicken wings.  At first glance the brisket looked fine, but at a closer glance, it's filled with tendons and egg plant.  The order was for brisket, not tendons.  Now the chicken wings.  Had a few, then I tasted blood and crystal clear chicken meat.  Then I completely lost my appetite.  I was too tried to complain there and then.  So this is my review.  2 stars for the service, since we were the only table there, it seemed normal enough."}
{"text":"Came here again for lunch today.  Just realized they have a separate menu book that they don't give you unless you ask for it.  The menu contains a variety of dishes from steak combo to rice dishes and snacks.  For some items, menu prices seem better than the \"specials\" for some reason.  For example the spicy Guilin vermicelli soup noodles is $5.99 vs the special combo for $6.99 which includes a drink (meaning you're paying an extra $1 for the drink which you may not want)."}
{"text":"Came here and on my second time got a stomachache after I got home and started to feel ill and continued to feel sick for the next few days. If you want to have a nice meal you can try here. Small portions and a large portion of virus. Pretty much cash only. If you pay debt they add a surcharge and the tip starts at 11%. I've veto this place, as should you."}
{"text":"With an average of 4 stars I was expecting better. Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff but definitely below average for me. But then again you do get what you pay for. The prices here are pretty low when you select from their special lunch menu. I got the all day break fast meal for $7.50 which came with cream soup, 2 eggs, ham, a slice of bread, steak pieces with spaghetti noodles in soup and milk tea. It sounds like a lot on paper but its a pretty simple dish. Things I didn't like about the meal: The cream soup was bland and had nothing in it. Bread was cold and didn't taste fresh, Noodles were too soft and the steak pieces were way below average.  Also got a chance to try the ox tongue dish. This one was actually A okay. The ox tongue was soft and tender and tasted good.  Service was fast even though the place was busy.  Overall, good prices with decent food done quickly."}
{"text":"All day breakfast HK style. They're egg sandwich and milk tea are my comfort foods from here. Can get packed on weekends late mornings coz of the church across the street. Everything else is average HK cafe style food."}
{"text":"I come to this place every so often if I'm in the area (usually if I'm getting a haircut down by Simon I'd come here).  Don't be underwhelmed by what seems like a lack of selections in here. If you look around the walls you'll see a lot more choices for your meal (e.g: Baked rice/spaghetti, steak, kids meal, etc). In fact, this place has quite a huge variety in food choices.  I usually go with their all day exotic meal which consists of a milk toast, abalone with shredded chicken and ham + macaroni, which tastes quite decent. I've also had their beef brisket special as well as the instant noodle special, which also tastes pretty good for what it's worth.  Iced lemon tea is not the best here, extremely bitter taste. Unfortunately it's the best around the area, as none of the food court stalls have good iced lemon tea.  Service is good if the place isn't busy and if you're not sitting by the far corner, but if it gets busy you may need to wave down someone for service."}
{"text":"Pros: Extensive menu Service/Decor is good  Cons: Portions could be better  I've been to this place before and after the renovation.  Before, it looked like your typical old school HK style cafe.  Now, it's still old school but with modern touches which I like.  The walls are lined with digital wallpapers which look real nice.  There are also blackboards lined across some walls and pillars which I love.    The menu here is very extensive.  They have everything an HK cafe should have.  There are specials for certain times of the day to be taken advantage of as well.  We ordered a baked chicken with cheese and spaghetti and a XO sauce fried beef noodle.  The food comes out in relatively good time.  Both dishes were pretty good.  I just had issue with portion size.  They were quite smaller compared to other HK style cafes. I finished my noodles in no time and was still a bit hungry.  The food was prepared well, I just wish there was more of it.  The service here was very good for the most part.  They can get quite busy here so sometimes it can be difficult to get a hold of someone.  When you do though, there's no difficulties at all.    This is a place I'll definitely be back too.  I will think on it a bit though if I'm super hungry."}
{"text":"My wife was hungry and decided to try this place. It was busy but we found a place to sit. My wife had a noodle soup with lunch meat and egg with french toast and carnation milk. I was not that hungry so I had the toasted pineapple bun. Both came with milk tea. The food came quickly. Everything was delicious. My wife even said it reminded her of great Hong Kong style she used to have. The price was also reasonable.  Will certainly return."}
{"text":"I am starting to doubt the service of this place. Came here for breakfast and ordered the fried chicken. I thought everything was okay, until I received a soy sauce style chicken instead. I told the waitress that I didn't order this kind of chicken. She responded by saying, \"It's supposed to be that way.\" Very unprofessional. P.S. I ordered it before, it was fried! Shocker!"}
{"text":"Food was not worth the price. Service was nonexistent. Water/tea was not refilled despite the fact that there were 3 waitresses (only 3 tables were occupied for the entire time). Ordered the steak on hot plate, portion was good but the steak was so chewy that my knife couldn't cut into it properly. The salad that came with it was a weird mix of ham, papaya, corn, and lettuce (tasted terrible). My friend ordered the baked chicken on rice which tasted bland and the sauce was not appealing. I've been to a lot better HK cafes that charge better prices with tastier food, this place was a letdown. Also, apparently they charge 30cents for a large takeout box. Good luck getting decent tips from customers if the waitresses insist on charging for takeout boxes.   Only redeeming factor was the nice decorations, otherwise would've given it one star."}
{"text":"Breakfast is pretty good, the egg sandwich and milk tea is one of the better ones in the area."}
{"text":"I go there because it's close to where I live but I realize that their food quality is getting worse and worse. I never said anything and never complianed. The portion is getting stingy. Yeah give you a lot of the bread and noodle but the missing the key ingredient. Now they don't even care about the customer service.  The waiter asked me if I wanted a drink and I told him that the dish I ordered doesn't include a drink. The waiter then assured me that it includes a drink! So I went ahead and ordered a drink. What do I know right? He works there. I should trust him. At the end the bill came and charged me for the drink. I told them that the waiter said my dish includes a drink that's why I ordered. Otherwise I wouldn't have. They said they made a mistake but I still have to pay for it. What??? This is ridiculous. They asked the customer to pay for their mistake?? They are willing to upset a customer and risk the business and reputation  over a 3 dollar drink??  Well I'm not going back ever again. This is a super stingy restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a typical HK cafe that serves very decent, inexpensive, filling meals. They have an extensive menu, ranging from breakfast, sandwiches, baked rice dishes and steak dinners, all for less than $15. I got a mixed grill which came with a piece of fish, chicken, and steak. The cuts of meat themselves were average, I wasn't expecting much for the price anyhow. The meal comes with rice, some vegetables, and to start the set meals include a soup, garlic toast and some odd mayonnaise salad. Service was alright, however one diner had some sort of argument with a diner over payment, which seemed unprofessional. The restaurant itself was clean and updated, and the food was decently tasty with large portions. Would likely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Satisfied my craving for hk style sizzling steak!   What i ordered: Dinner sizzling combos -Fillet mignon -steak, fish, chicken  Each combo came with  Hk style ham and potato salad  And a choice of: Chinese pork bone soup or cream of chicken soup Rice or spaghetti  A variety of sauce/gravy Hot or cold drink  For the price of $16.99, you get A LOT of food. Everything was what I wanted to satisfy my crave. We came at around 9:10 knowing they close at 10pm. They took our orders and served us pretty quick. But started rushing us to eat and pay by 9:45pm in which i understand, but made me felt pressured and rushed."}
{"text":"Why didn't I come here sooner! I've heard good things about this place and as I was looking for a HK diner I decided to give this place a try. I always pass by this place when I go to the Gong Cha next door but never really took an interest into it until recently.   This place gets packed during dinner rush and I can understand why. They have set dinner menus for cheap prices and large portions. I got the filet mignon dinner set and my girlfriend got the sirloin steak. The sets come with UNLIMITED soup (cream soup or Chinese soup) and garlic bread. It also comes with a side of vegetables, rice/noodles, salad and a drink (get the cold lemon tea!!). The salad was not for me (it had a weird tasting dressing with slices of ham) but everyone else was good. We also got the wonton soup with rice noodles and it was only $4.99 and it was HUGE.   The only thing I hope they would improve on is service. They brought out the food one at a time instead of all together and that really took away the dining experience.   Overall the good: food, portions, decor and free wifi (hongkongtea)  The bad: service"}
{"text":"Randomly found this place! Id say it's the one of the best HK cafe in the area. It's clean, spacious and the prices is as little as a Chinese food court.  Highlight of the visit: bake set lunch $6.99 or silicon get hot plate mix grill for $14.99.   Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 4.5/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 4/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Fun Factor: na/5"}
{"text":"Came here for a Chinese high tea. Ordered a satay beef Raman. I've never been to this restaurant but it's been open for a long time I think. Recently, they got a big renovation and the look has been refreshed. The satay beef Raman is pretty standard for a hong Kong style high tea. With that a cold milk tea.   The raman is pretty good and have no complaint. The portion is appropriate. The ice tea is good though the hot ones they did skip on the milk a bit and had to ask for more. But that very opinionated so it's not a factor in the rating.   Overall, it's not bad. Nothing special but if you need a HK style resturant, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"I'd forgotten how much I loved this place while I was in school, and now that I've revisited, it's the same amazing HK milk tea, cheap \"all-day breakfast\" options and afternoon tea options too. Only difference is that now it's newly renovated and has a much cleaner, sleeker feel to it.  Came with the BF after running errands all morning and early afternoon. I ordered the Satay meal off the breakfast menu ($~7) which includes an egg or ham sandwich, satay beef with vermicelli and tea/coffee. The egg sandwich was SO fluffy, and fresh HK style bread. The noodles were good too, and for such a bargain price! BF got a much less impressive dish, though....baked pork on macaroni with cheese. I pictured the usual baked dishes, all thick and hearty, but this one was more like baked, pieces of cardboard on KD. I'll stick to my classic HK diner orders from now on.  Such cheap! So yum! Mental note to bring the papa out here next time - he LOVES good milk tea!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love to find different places with some of my favorite hometown foods. HK cafés in Toronto may not be the same as the ones I used to go to in Hong Kong, but it is definitely a close second. I remember always sharing macaroni and toast and a hearty breakfast with my dad like our own little foodition in Vancouver (food + tradition). And it brings back great memories when I eat here as I go to school in Toronto while my family is back at home.   Metro square cafe has a great atmosphere. It's clean and tidy and it also has a great spacing of the tables. The food is good, whether it be noodles, soup or rice! Especially their mini bun with butter and condensed milk, it's a HK classic."}
{"text":"HK style breakfast, can't go wrong when I don't have to wait in line for 20mins like you usually have to on the weekends..."}
{"text":"Metro Squre Cafe is the sister company of Mei Cheun in Scarborough. However the deco and the environment is a lot better. The seatings are more comfortable and the place is much cleaner!  The menu is really similar with the same set menu. I usually having a a late lunch/brunch. My favourite is the Satay Meal set ($4.99) that comes with a Satay beef noodle soup, egg sandwich and coffee/tea. The HK style tea is one of the best in the area and I love their egg sandwich because the egg is always really fluffy.  However, there is not too much healthy options, the bread is usually white bread and not much fresh vegetables.   If you are looking for fast services and consistent food that's the place to go!  CASH only!"}
{"text":"You really get what you pay for. This is your go to place if you want fast and cheap Hong Kong breakfast. For $4, you can't expect much. But their teas are really worthwhile and tastes really authentic. They are pretty much known for their teas. Food and service is fast. There are plentiful of seats and spacious."}
{"text":"Metro Square Cafe Restaurant is an authentic HK cafe.  The food is reasonably good and I like the milk tea.  It is creamy and addicting.  For breakfast, I liked ordering the C meal - it had vermicelli or macaroni or spaghetti with two toppings of your choice - I chose red sausage and satay beef.  It came with toast and a drink.    For all other times, I usually order the Guilin Noodle.  It is very tomato-y and full of cilantro and green onion.  I have influenced a couple of my friends to order this too because it is quite tasty!  The service is hit or miss, but one can only expect so much from an HK style cafe.  Wi-fi is also available.  All in all, I will continue coming back here when the craving hits."}
{"text":"I visit this HK cafe a few times a week. They have been around for a long time - the service was always good, price is reasonable, food is delicious, and everything comes out really fast. Today I left my wallet at home and was highly embarrassed that I was not able to pay my bill. I offered to leave my cellphone behind to hold as deposit while I go home to get my wallet. The owner was very nice, insisted for me not to leave my phone behind and take my time to go home to get money if needed. Being in the hospitality service business for many years, I really value these experiences and moments of truth. Although my bill was only $7, the manager made my feel valued as a customer. The staff also mentioned that they recognizes me as a regular customer so no need to stress about it. I would always choose this HK cafe over others in the area just because they value their customers and not always about money."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style restaurant with lots to choose from on the menu.  The walls also featured dishes as well.  Basically, every where you turn, you can see the menu. My friend mentioned that they serve toasts with condensed milk, which gave me the cravings.  So i decided to check this place out.  I went late in the afternoon so there was no issue getting a table.  After studying the menu, i decided to get instant noodles with luncheon meat and fried egg.  It also came with coffee or tea, and a piece of buttered toast with condensed milk.  All that for $6.  I switched the regular tea for Hong Kong style tea for an extra $3.  The food came fast and tasted ok.  After all, how can anything go wrong with instant noodles.  The service was ok.  My friend and i weren't too sure if the waitress understood our orders since she didn't speak.  But luckily she got our orders right.  The only thing that i was not too pleased with was at the end when we had to pay an extra $0.50 for using the debit machine, and also we had a choice of a tip to give.  I am an avid believer that tips should be given based on the quality of service, and that we should not be forced to give a certain percentage."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch since it was close from work. I ordered the spicy grilled chicken steak with spaghetti. As per usual at an HK café, it also comes with coffee or tea and soup. I had my meal with milk tea and house soup and I shall warn you to not get the hot milk tea. It had a bitterness to it and I got a weird texture I believe from the milk. If I were to come here again I would for sure order the lemon tea instead. The meal was okay, a bit salty for my liking. I was not expecting a lot from this type of cuisine, but I think they should have at least mixed the noodles with the sauce so it's more even instead of just pouring it at the top. Although, the size of the chicken steak was decent and the staff was quick to respond. Overall, there's a lot of other HK cafés that I would prefer to go to instead."}
