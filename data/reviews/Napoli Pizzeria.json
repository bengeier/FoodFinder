{"text":"I honestly haven't experienced any rudeness at all. Not at any moment. We have been coming here for years. I much rather pick up the food, as the wait time is usually long. We enjoy it, it's always hot and tasty."}
{"text":"Ive been going there for years but the last 2times my pizza was pretty dry like there being cheap with the sauce&cheese!!!"}
{"text":"Took over one hour for medium size. Many others coming and going in the meantime. Wtf?"}
{"text":"It's so good, we enjoyed their food 3 times this past week.  Lasagna, chicken wings, and pizza... All fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food is epic and i love their burgers and got sandwiches. 

The only thing that prevents me from a full 5 start reading is the delivery guy. It's some grumpy old dude with a chip on his shoulder. I don't say shit to em. Only time he had ever been pleasant is if you give him some high tip."}
{"text":"First visit to Napoli. Had the Alfredo Pizza. Delicious! Alfredo sauce, Mozerella cheese, mushroom, and chicken. Perfect crust! Really good!
Business place, all employees moving quickly and working hard! We'll definitly be back....soon!"}
{"text":"My absolute  favorite place to buy wings!!!! I always get the HOT, yes they are hot but they are BOMB!! 12wings with fries for $10 can't  beat that. 

Customer service has always been good except once but I forgave them because my wings were good lol."}
{"text":"Delivery for a 30\" Italian sausage pizza to our strip hotel took 1hr 46min.  Definitely not a fast experience.  However, pizza was still hot and satisfying."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from this joint.  Took forever and then forgot hot sauce/ranch.  Still bringing,  but told me I would have to wait another 45 minutes to an hour for hot sauce and ranch. .. so now,  my chicken wings will be cold.  Excellent service -_- #whack #deliverysucks #terriblecustomerservice"}
{"text":"The pizza and hoagies are very good and for reasonable prices. Our orders can be a little picky, but they've always accomidated special request without issue. Can't say the same about the other (more expensive) pizza places on Murray."}
{"text":"i love napoli's.. i usually order the blackened chicken salad with their vinegarette dressing.. amazing.! the girls have great customer service.. im a customer for life."}
{"text":"O M G this pizza is amazing.
Was in Vegas for the weekend, the boyfriend and I were craving pizza... Located this place on yelp... Picked it up and took it back to the hotel... our experience was filled with plenty food-gasms. 

Cheese, sauce, crust, meat, etc.. Everything was great. Great price too!

I must say, the wait was a bit long. We were quoted one time, then 20 minutes was added to the original time. 

All and all... It's a must try for a Vegas trip! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I would consider Napoli one of my favorite pizza places in town, but they have a big flaw: poor customer service. Their food is pretty great, prices very reasonable. Open late too. But more than once I've been let down by the lack of communication between staff, and inattention to me, the customer.  

Tonight I was flying solo, and sat at the counter. I figured that would be a high-visibility location, but I guessed wrong. Took me 20 minutes to get my soda (after paying while ordering). The soda and pizza came at same time, and that was the only time I saw a server before asking for a box, which I had to flag someone to get. I felt like they were deliberately avoiding me which doesn't make for a great dining experience.  Get it to go, you'll be thankful."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We ordered a stromboli and antipasto and waited an hour (which is to be expected with stromboli) for what is truly a delicious meal.  When our order arrived the antipasto was just a salad, and the stromboli was completely raw.   We called the store and the girl that answered the phone was completely apologetic and assured us that the order would be corrected and sent out immediately.  We took this to mean it would be a priority order.  Instead it's been about 1/12 hrs. which was longer than the original order and the driver has not arrived.  We called the store and were given a run around. The correction to this order was clearly not a priority.  Shame on Napoli"}
{"text":"always get the 30 inch pizza with pep,mushrooms, sausage and it never disappoints. Love this pizza place . worth the long drive - worth the price- Keep it Up"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pizza here, I will be coming back to this place! They have a variety of toppings that I like and a 16inch pizza deal 8.99 1 topping! The place is pretty clean and nice to sit and enjoy a pizza. The only reason I pinky put 4 stars because it's not better than my favorite pizza haha still liked it though"}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 3 stars.  Penne primovera was excellent. Lasagna also exceptional, esp with the meatballs. Fresh freshly baked pain chaud out of the oven.  Owner is friendly and gracious.  Would def repeat.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I used to love Napolis and ordered from them all the time. So far this year I have spent over $500. The last 2 times were a complete disgrace with my order. I ordered a week ago, and the food didnt come for 2 hours. The restaurant said sorry they screwed up and it could be out in 45 minutes. I asked if they could guarantee the food here by that time because it had almost been 3 hours and then couldnt guarantee anything so I canceled the order. I decided to give it another shot last night and ordered a well done pizza. The pizza was falling apart and was very sloppy. I also had tipped the delivery driver over $20. The manager refused to come get the pizza, or even replace it. I hadnt even eaten the pizza because it was that bad, I only had 1 slice. Now i feel a little queezy this morning and my stomach isnt happy with the food I put in my body last night. You cant treat customers like this or else your business will tank. I would not recommend ordering food from this place, your better off going to a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"So, this is our go-to place for pizza delivery. Sad that it's three stars. It would actually be four, but for the lack of consistency. Once, the pizza comes undercooked (which is awesome for leftovers) but a bit of a pain if you have to bake it further when your delivery arrives); the next time, it comes just under overcooked. Just. Almost perfect that day, but a little dried out as leftovers. 

The quality of the pizza has been good every time. Can't complain about that. Just the lack of consistency in prep. The quality of other things... meh. But that's why pizza is the most delivered food in the US. It travels well. 

Speaking of traveling, the delivery is excellent. Could be because I add the tip ahead of time and it's always 20 percent or at least $10. I don't think it's too much to compensate for my laziness for not going to pick it up myself. And I want to make sure the driver is paid well. Would you want to deliver food for a living? I know I wouldn't. 

Napoli, work on your consistency and on the quality of your Philly cheese steak sandwiches and we'll likely be customers for life. Good pizza at the end of it all. I'll up your stars if I can get three pizzas in a row cooked consistently. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great plain pizza (neither too salty nor too greasy)  and fantastic chicken parmesian"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 medium pizzas for delivery and paid with credit card.  When the delivery person arrived we gave him $5.00 in cash for tip and he added in the carbon copy of the sales receipt $5.00 extra.  BE AWARE!!! the delivery driver will add extra tip without consent.  MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A COPY OF YOUR SALES DRAFT UNTIL CHARGE POST to confirm that your not being over charged."}
{"text":"Veggie pizza at Napoli is yucky...

With the exception of the onions, all of the veggies are from cans or jars."}
{"text":"i had two terrible experiences with this place however that is not the purpose of this review. i write this review now because i had written one that got filtered out by yelp's site software that, i guess, will not show a review if it deems it unreliable. (at the bottom of the page there is a link to read filtered reviews). hopefully this review wont be filtered, but just wanted to let people be aware that though 11 one star reviews were filtered (mine included) an almost equal number of 5 star reviews were filtered at 9. however after reading the 1 star reviews 8/11 mentioned something about the terrible customer service they received. really yelp? you don't see the pattern?"}
{"text":"I ordered hot wings /fries. I was completely dissatisfied with the entire order. I contacted the manager and shared my experiences and he was not understanding nor accommodating. I do not recommend this business. Customer service is key :)"}
{"text":"Best service and pizza in Vegas. We popped in form my moms 60th and though they were busy, they made sure everything was fabulous! We love Napolis!!"}
{"text":"So authentic!!
Pizza was good
Decorations were 3spooky5me
Tri-lingual arguments between kitchen and wait staff. Much funny
9/10 would come back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!  Good quality cheese, not too greasy; homemade sauce and oregano flavor in my mouth all make this the yummiest pizza.  The first time I had it I could taste all the flavors and now this is the place I go when I want a slice or a whole pizza.  Their prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is simple yet fitting.  I even ordered their giant pizza for a party and it didn't lose any of its flavor.  Go here once and you will forget the rest."}
{"text":"Napoli Restaurant  is my favorite pizza place . The good thing is they have the best giant 30 \" pizza so yummy I love at .  Napoli is the best. Restaurant"}
{"text":"Service is rude, but pizza is great. Order at least two slices because they are small and will leave you craving more. The pepperoni is the best and I usually order cheese at other places. The pepperoni curls up and get all crispy and delicious. Like little cups to hold the grease. Yum!"}
{"text":"Way better than aiellos and mineos and everything else. I've lived in squirrel hill for 5 years and I can tell you that the delicious pizza smell making this neighborhood smell fantastic is coming from Napoli!"}
{"text":"Awesome some food the only problem is the servers only one older lady was running around the whole place cleaning tables picking up checks and trying to take care of every customer the rest of the workers were just standing behind the counter."}
{"text":"I just called and tried to order but they were extremely rude! She literally yelled at me! Their food is decent but definitely not worth getting yelled at. Have came here on about 3 occasions and they are always very rude! I believe its all family so even if you complain, nothing gets done. I would not recommend at all. Not worth getting yelled at!"}
{"text":"Très souvent full quand on passe devant, full quand j'ai décidé de l'essayer. Je m'attendais à un service lent et j'me suis pas trompé mais pas pantoute. Au moins j'y étais mindé. :-)

C'est le genre de place à aller avec Grand-maman (pour le duo guitare/violon qui se promène dans le resto en jouant les demandes spéciales des plus jolies doyennes de la place) avec réservation et si possible, choisissez votre table.

Grand choix de pâte et pizza, rien de marquant comme spécialité en tant que tel non plus.

Je ne crois pas y retourner, y'a mieux dans le genre sur le même rue."}
{"text":"First let me preface this review, I do not like giving bad reviews.

Napoli Pizza & Restaurant has Dine-in, take out and delivery. 
Their menu has soups, appetizers, salads, chicken wings & fingers, chicken dinners, ribs, hot & cold sandwiches, hamburgers, pasta, veal, desserts, a children's menu and Pizza. 

their pricing is about average for what they serve.

I like Pizza, I have had a number of different types of pizza, different places around the world and there are a few things that I expect when I order a pizza for delivery. First the pizza be there when I am told it would arrive, Napoli Pizza was in the time frame that they say they would arrive. That was the best part of the experience.

The Pizza I ordered was a 24\" Alfredo Pizza with Canadian Bacon. The pizza toppings was in the center of the pizza, about what you would expect on a 14\" or 16\" pizza. The Canadian Bacon was cut up deli ham (I love Canadian Bacon on my pizza, when I order Canadian Bacon I expect Canadian Bacon). The center of the pizza was soggy, and the dough did not appear to be cooked all the way. I am not sure if it was because they cooked it and let it sit in the box awhile or if it was just under cooked. The outside edge of the pizza was brown. Instead of the traditional wedge cut slices the pizza was cross cut into small squares, and most of the time it was not cut all the way through. That could have been because it was such a large pizza.

Overall I can give them 1 star for being on time, however, the pizza although barely edible, it is not a pizza I would ever order from them again, so I give 1 star for the pizza. 

They have a very large selection on their menu, unfortunately, because of the experience I had with the pizza I will not sample any other items, This is one delivery menu I will be throwing away."}
{"text":"Deliciousos!!! Amazing just the best pizza I ever had!! Literally! ! The pizza is so good we order it at work!! THANK YOU GUYS"}
{"text":"Horrible service. 2 hours for delivery and when we got our order it was wrong. I called to complain and he said they had to come pick up all the food for a refund. Meaning after waiting 2 hours I still had to go get food from somewhere else. Too bad we refer a lot of people there at my boyfriends work but that will stop immediately. Hopefully they actually refund the money. Doubtful though and they'll probably give our rejected food to someone else."}
{"text":"REALLY good cheese pizza--some of my favorite in the Burgh! I find Mineo's to be super-cheesy and the best crust from Pizza Perfectta in Shadyside."}
{"text":"The first time having there pizza was so delicious. I couldn't say anything bad about there service or food. If you're looking for wide variety of yummy food come here. They serve more than one special. And late night deliver was a plus!"}
{"text":"I have to start this review off by saying I order from Napoli's often. Food is always great! Went in to have lunch today, told the hostess we wanted to sit outside, nobody came to greet us for ten minutes. Ordered the pizza and finger special, a beer, and iced tea, and water. I received my beer right away. Never got any of the other beverages. Had to go inside to remind the server about our drinks. Service was terrible!!! We got our pizza and fingers before we got our drinks the fingers were so hot we could not eat them. No one ever came to check on us the whole time we were there. I had to flag a server down to get our bill. So disappointed!  I'll say this over and over again.... TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!! Never will go back for dine in again."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my order an hour!!! They were just keeping said my order will ready in 10 minutes!!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat pizza here in Vegas!!!!! I love it every time we come here!! The people who work here are always so nice and sweet and the food is the best :) so don't hesitate to come and try this delicious pizza place yummy"}
{"text":"It was great. First day of the outdoor patio scene and these guys and gal were ready to rumble. Brilliant service. Wait staff were knowledgable, funny and friendly. Food was very good. Pizza 101 ways, amazing. Nice thin crust and piping hot....good oven. Pasta was through the roof. Well done!"}
{"text":"Good pizza place. Fast delivery. Tasted fresh and hot. The \"Italian special\" with garlic, artichoke, tomatoes, pepperoni and sausage was great. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"To put it in a nutshell, we ordered online through Eat 24 for a large meat lovers Pizza. After about nearly 3 hours of waiting they claimed that they had just gotten the order in their system and said that the delivery is on the way and should be about 5 min, now nearly 20 minutes later we are STILL waiting on the pizza. After the pizza delivery comes he hands over the the pizza and we open it to find out that's it's not the order we placed, about 10 minutes later the pizza delivery guy comes back with the pizza we ordered. Now this is the more disappointing part, we call to complain to the manager and he proceeds to tell us that it was the delivery guys fault for bringing the wrong pizza and made it seem like we were at fault for ordering through a third party website or app. Regardless.....after waiting nearly 3 hours for our pizza all he said was an apology and that he can't do nothing else with a negative tone and a disgusting attitude. Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"I kept getting ads on my front door but ignored them. I finally stopped in for lunch and I have to say, I love this place. I've come for their wings 2 days in a row now I've had the garlic balls... AMAZING! The atmosphere is great and the service was phenomenal. Didn't have to wait long at all for my order."}
{"text":"I have to say good pizza, good boneless garlic parmesan chicken. The service, not so hot although I still order from here."}
{"text":"Order a 16 pizza that was very good
But the customers service is a joke.
First ask for a side Tabasco and they charge $1
Then ask for mariner sauce  $1
Every thing is extra???
Please let you're customers got the spices with the pizza and not tell him that he can buy from somebody else"}
{"text":"Their pizza is awesome, but I recommend only getting pizza and not waste money on anything else on the menu.
I always place phone order for delivery. Made the mistake in ordering calamari for friends (they're calamari sticks btw) and I ordered myself curry fries with cheese. First off, cheese curly fries came with bacon which was not mentioned on the online menu or on the phone. Curly fries were also cold and soggy. The cheese on top was hard. Either way had to throw away because I don't eat meat, they need to clarify this on their menu.  Calamari sticks were also cold and soggy, had to throw away too.
I've ordered from here quite a few times, since I do love their pizza. The lady on the phone always sounds angry, irritated, and desperate to get off the phone. Also, bec of her accent, it's very hard to understand her. Not the best service here."}
{"text":"I have been getting food from here for the past couple of years and hands down their pizza is definitely one of the best at any price-point. It is now my go-to pizza spot. I've also had their wings which are great, they have there own unique flavor that I find myself craving along with the pizza. I can also say that their philly steak and gyro is also consistently good."}
{"text":"This place is fine. We ordered the pick up special which is a good value. The menu is a little steep. I think the place is run by Chechnyans so some Americans might interpret their matter-of-fact attitudes as being rude. It only means you get an honest pizza.  If you want a genuine pizza and not a corporate pie, try the take out special. 

Delivery service for any pizza place has too many variables. Busy, lame unreliable drivers, traffic, other deliveries fouling things up. I never review a place based on delivery. One day you get it in 20, another day the same thing in 80. Restaurants can't control delivery like Americans expect. 

If you speak directly and tell them you problem without tiptoeing and being a kitten, Chechnyans will respect you and do what it takes to resolve the problem."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for pick up on the phone and the lady I spoke to is rude. This lady doesnt know how to talk to customers in a good manner. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great! Not the best I've ever had, but the service was quick and the thin crust is just the way I like it. Price was also spot on and having spent a lot for hotel room it was nice to be able to swing by and grab a pizza and take it back to our room for dinner. Well worth the trip away from the strip."}
{"text":"Got there around 5pm on Victoria Day. My bf and I were seated promptly. Service started OK. Girl with black hair started by asking us if we wanted something to drink. We ordered 2 glasses of Sangria that arrived pretty fast. We then ordered a pizza each. The Italian sausage was pretty good. My bf then ordered another sangria for himself and the waitress NEVER ended up serving it. She never came back to tend to us. It got quite frustrating. I stood up to ask another guy who worked there for the bill. He never passed the message to our waitress. Horrible service. Once we got the bill, we noticed that the 3rd sangria was charged. We had to ask to remove it. The staff does not know how to speak English well. Would not go back there again. There are tons of better pizzerias in Mtl. Not worth it."}
{"text":"30 minutes a burger and fries? ridiculous. you guys are losing valuable business. I was ready to give you guys my cash. oh well."}
{"text":"Revised (2016).  Five years ago I tried Napoli and didn't think it was very good.  Something changed.  Most recent visits have been very good. NYC style, great toppings.  I always get take out.  The seating area is kind of different, and it's a place you might take your family but not a date.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything on the Menu is Great!
We go all the time Great pizza and great chicken wings. And the place is very clean they remodel that's a plus.... Good Lil spot,  there pizza is better then the Cosmopolitan pizza upstairs from the casino on the strip...."}
{"text":"Bad place to eat!! I ordered a chicken tenders and when I got the food it was cold and I called the place and spoke to the supervisor. I told him that my order is cold and I want to return it MYSELF and get a new one. The supervisor told me that I can't return the food and he can't do nothing about it. I've work in food and beverage for a long time so i know how to debate when it comes to bad service.. Then after a long debate he finally gave up and told me that let me ask my manager.. After their conversation he offered me that he can replace my order with fresh and half one but with one condition im only giving you half of what you order.. I was really pissed!!! Paid $40+ and only got half of my order and I need to drive back to this shit hole to get my half and return my cold full order. The supervisor was Indian forgot his name. Don't eat at this place!!! Never wrote a bad review before but this is my first one!!"}
{"text":"They have some really great deals and our pizza was awesome. Took about 40 minutes to deliver (they were earlier than the estimate)"}
{"text":"I ordered a white pizza for lunch through wheel deliver and it was literally the worst pizza I've had in my life. Zero flavor, hard as a rock, and honestly was probably five days old and reheated. I paid 30 dollars for a medium pizza and a salad, and I might as well just thrown that money in the garbage because that's where that repulsive combination of flour and tomato sauce went. I called to complain about he quality and got zero reaction. I frankly don't understand how this joint is still in business. Gross, repulsive, and unresponsive to their customer. Never order from this place!"}
{"text":"Love, love love their chopped large salad with their great blue cheese dressing.  Pizzas are pretty consistent and the larger one are cut into squares like Chicago....love that.  The garlic knots are perfect not too much oil or garlic and sprinkled with cheese...nicely done."}
{"text":"I'd like to amend the review I wrote the other day, Napoli is great when it comes to pizza and chicken fingers, wings, etc. If you order the Greek salad, it's really good usually. To order another kind of salad, ugh. We've tried both their Caesar and dinner salad and they were both poor in quality and tonight, no dressing came with it. Such a disappointment for such a good place. Please step up your salads, we love you guys!"}
{"text":"I did NOT enjoy my time at this restaurant AT ALL. The staff was mediocre at best and the food was downright disgusting. You know when you eat half of your plate and you still walk away feeling bloated and weighed down? I had the pasta but the pizza looked like the store-bought pizza Delissio, which is good, but why would you pay $15 for a slice? The pasta sauce was not even fresh, it looked like a bunch of cans put together, and super greasy. Just not worth it at all and I not only do not recommend it, but I inform people not to go there ever. And I am usually very easy with reviews. Plenty of other GREAT places in Montreal guys!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from Napoli for years and have yet to try their pizza! I'm not a big pizza fan but love Italian food.

I've had almost everything on their pasta menu but my favorite is the Baked Ravioli. OMG, that stuff is so good. If you're not sure what you want try the Whole Lotta Pasta. It's good but it has manicotti in it and I don't care for that cheese that goes into manicotti.

The deserts are good too. Oh, and the garlic balls. . .you have to try those. I haven't ordered from this particular Napoli in about a year because I moved to Silverado Ranch but the one here is just as good."}
{"text":"They took to long on the order so I had to cancel. Not only did they lose the order, but they lost a regular. It's amazing what a phone call can do, yet they couldn't even do that. Never again."}
{"text":"I work at a nearby building that is 24 hours and this is our go to for middle of the night munchies. some nights they deliver all the way up until 5am they have really cheap pick up specials as 

how is the food you ask??
well  and their food is super fresh and has a homemade taste to it they have a huge calzones that are stuffed with ricotta and mozzarella and your choice of toppings they have everything from pasa to solid two burgers too hot subs too cold subs 2 appetizers to calamari to soups to desserts then of course their specialty pizzas

I do not think I can I call a single menu item that I got from this place that I did not  enjoy its good home cooked Italian food delivered to your door almost 24 /7"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza hands down. The secret is the ingredients--so fresh and of such high quality. The crust is both chewy and crunchy. Napoli leaves the others in the dust."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. The burgers are fresh and you can really taste the quality. The appetizers are large portions and always hot when delivered"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 1:20am, didn't come until 3:30am. Keep in mind this also was on a Monday!! Food was cold and took forever. Wouldn't recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Wonderful crust and cheese. Service is great too.  Their  pickup special is the best in the city. I have been looking for a great place for pizza and have found Napoli. Give them a try I think you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Amazing service and friendly staff. The good is always food. The pizza is great and the wings taste as good as any actual wing place"}
{"text":"this place deserves more than 3 starts for sure! the pizza was so tasty and authentic. since it is the summer we could sit out on this patio they created and the atmosphere was so lovely. there were many options for pizza, definitely 2 pages of selection. even the rolls of bread before our meal were delicious.  only complaint is that the service was slow and they had no character."}
{"text":"I made a yelp just to leave this review..  

It took them almost 2 hours to get my order to me when I placed it online. I ordered it at 523 didn't get it until a little after 7. When I got the food it was barely warm. However the food was really good. Just super greasy. Extremely disappointed after reading lots of good reviews."}
{"text":"I like this kinda pizza. Floppy and thin with a thick non greasy flour dusted crust. The pepperoni and sauce, very tasty. Over all hey for 7 bux I would rather buy this than at some overpriced chain. Further more I got wings,fries, a drink and a 16\" pepperoni for 15 bux! Cant get that at ANY national brand pizza chain, you would looking at damn near 40 bux! Yes, they seem a lil cranky but who cares foods good and its cheap. I can deal with a little lack of service to save a fistfull of cash. I would also like to add, I dont know who she is but the cashier was a dark haired beauty. Again, great pizza, great price and a little eye candy to boot. Im not complaining! The interior of the restaurant isnt as cold and sterile as I thought it would be from pictures I found online. Its actually quiet, they're is plenty of room for a large party or if its just a small family of three. Heres the BIGGY! When you drive into the complex from sahara, your going to drive through the shopping center and turn left at the end. and then a another left to its front door Its directly across from fit for ten."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pie here, ordered late night quick delivery nice delivery driver.  Pizza was hot and fresh, sauce was good, toppings were generous, would definatly order from here again"}
{"text":"We read some reviews on Yelp and had mixed feelings about ordering from Napoli.. We thought we should give it a shot and see for ourselves.  We planed on grading the restaurant on 3 levels.  How they take the order, if they deliver on time and the quality of food.  And I have to admit they nailed it on all 3 levels.  The guy that took the order was very professional, he repeated the order back to make sure nothing was missed, gave us the  dollar amount and told us 1 hour..  Sure enough 1 hour later the bell rang.  The delivery guy was very nice, he set the food on the table and left.  We had ordered 40 wings (20 no flavor, BBQ sauce on the side and the new mango habanero flavored wings, they were amazing), we also ordered the 30\" pizza well done and boy was that good and 3 large orders of French fries.  The prices were great, $79 fed 6 adults and 10 kids.  Not too bad for 16 people..  Overall A+++.  If you haven't tried Napoli pizza, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service pizza was cold and took over an hour to deliver and only wanted to offer discount lol. Seems to be the common problem with this place as I read other reviews. Verrazano pizza on rainbow is by far better and friendly people not rude Russians who think there something for owning a pizza shop ha!!"}
{"text":"I Would Give This Place 5Stars But Lately There Customer Service Has Been Shit! The Night Team Provides Crappy Service, Its 2 Girls One Is Hispanic Short & The Other Is Tall White Girl With Tattoos That Are Rude & Take Forever To Acknowledge You! Only Person That Provides Excellent Customer Service Is Flor, Only Bad Thing She Works In The AM. Other Than That There Food Is Delicious, Pizza and Chicken Wings Are The Best! Its A Must Try Place To Go Eat Lunch/Dinner!"}
{"text":"Napoli dropped the ball this time. Spent over $60 on food. The Philly steak sandwich ordered with no veggies was about 85-90% bread. Called to speak to the manager, Lydia said she was the manager and since there were no veggies that's the way it is. Made no effort to make the sandwich atleast look presentable."}
{"text":"Love Napoli! The wings, fries, philly steaks and pizza never disappoint! It is our go to. Especially our late night cravings. 

Great customer service! The one lady gave my baby girls juice while we waited for take out. Super super sweet!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday evening; restaurant was not crowded. Service was not good: Waiters were not welcoming and I had to wait way too long to order, to get my food (one simple pizza) and then to pay. And even for that, the waiter was grumpy.

Pizza was decent but definitely had better elsewhere in Montreal."}
{"text":"We tried this place on the advice of a local, while visiting the area. We said we wanted a good pizza, something local, not a national chain. He directed us here, so we went in an ordered a pizza to go. While they made the pizza we walked to a nearby grocery store and selected a six-pack to take back to the room along with the pizza. We picked up the pizza and drove back to our motel. 

 Back in the room we settled in and opened our pizza and our beers. The pizza was fantastic. I don't recall exactly what we got, but half was just cheese (possibly four of them?) and the other half a pretty standard pepperoni and sausage. White sauce. It really was a great pizza. The beer was less than great, but I can hardly blame Napoli for that. The room was also only so-so, as was the Discovery Channel's show about giant catfish. But the vacation sex was hot, so all-in-all, a pretty good night.

 But the main point was the pizza. It was good. And now, everytime we're in Vegas, we order from them. But we stepped up the beer selection."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! A coworker and I had a great lunch. The burger and fries were awesome, tasted like a high end restaurant burger for a lot less. My coworker had a gyro and said it was really really good. Overall it's was a great lunch at a great place. I'm absolutely going back and oh by the way it's a super nice restaurant on the inside."}
{"text":"We have ordered from them every weekend we spend over 3p a week sometimes we end up spending more. They have even done catering to the company I worked for I have friend that have eaten at this place. Today we ordered pizza and we requested to add Oregano, which by the way Pizza come with Oregano I was told by this individual who I was placing my ordered with that I needed to pay $2.30 cents to have this done. Are you FUCKING kidding. Are you telling me that they are willing to loose a customer over 2.30 cents? THEY DID loose a customer OVER FUCKEN OREGANO.......DO NOT ADD OREGANO TO A MAIN INGREDIENT OF AN ITALIAN COUSIN"}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone for pick up. I arrive about 25 minutes later to pick up my food. When I walk in there are three people up front by the registers who are all on the phone. So no one acknowledges me. It's fine they're on the phone so I get it. I wait almost 10 minutes for them to acknowledge me then finally the guy gets off the phone and doesn't even look at me or ask me what I need he just walks away towards the back!!!! So I literally had to say excuse me to get his attention to pay for my damn food and get out. If I wasn't starving I would have just walked right out and not given them my business. Really rude staff up front!"}
{"text":"Good food but the service is terrible.  Took 26 minutes to get our food. Once we got it, no one came to check on us to refill our drinks, we had to go up to the counter to get someone.  They seem to be more worried about the phone orders than actual customers in the restaurant. terrible terrible terrible."}
{"text":"Working night shift doesn't give me and my coworkers many options for good food but we can always count on napolis. They deliver late into the night and their massive pizzas are perfect for big groups.The 4 item combo is awesome because you can get a huge pizza with different toppings on each quadrant. The napoli cheeseburger was pretty good too. Their menu is big and our order always comes correct."}
{"text":"Nearly 2 hours to get 3 sandwiches. 

Called at just over an hour and the guy said \"yeah they're sitting here.\" 

At 1 hour 45 minutes the driver showed up. He sped across the parking lot and parked blocking the entrance to our business. 

I asked what took so long and he snapped \"we're busy.\" He told me the food had just come out of the kitchen after the other guy in the phone had already told me the order was sitting there 40 minutes earlier. 

The sandwiches and fries were cold and soggy. Gross. 

I understand you thrive on drunk tourists rather than repeat customers. I get that you are busy now because it is tourist season. So maybe you don't care that your service sucks and your food does too. Maybe you don't care your driver is rude and I won't order again. .... But keep it up. Keep providing lousy service to locals and wait for winter. Tourist season doesn't last forever!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fresh and delicious. If you don't mind poor customer service and old school dining area, it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Food here is actually pretty good. Service, however, is literally the WORST. Waited 20+ minutes for sodas, almost an hour for any food to come out (& we got appetizers and entrees), everything came out at the same time, found hair in our salad, & was completely dismissed by the server and \"management\". I've never seen worse customer service before, not a single apology from anyone. At least PRETEND you care about customer experiences. It's really unfortunate because we are on this side of town all the time, but we will NEVER go back here."}
{"text":"Grew up in Squirrel Hill and found Napoli's pizza to be the best.  For the past seven years I have lived in O'Hara Township, and still drive to Squirrel Hill to pick up a Napoli pizza (no decent pizza joints in the Fox Chapel/Aspinwall/Blawnox area). 
They also have the best Italian Hoagie. I like mine with mayo and banana peppers.
Try their white pizza with tomatoes and feta cheese. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I can't actually comment on the food, since we waited well over an hour for our order - watching several other tables arrive, order, eat and leave - and still no pizza for us. Our waiter seemed friendly enough when we first arrived but then didn't once come back to our table to apologize for the delay nor offer us anything in the meantime. Nothing.

The place wasn't even busy (it was 10pm when we arrived) and yet a couple who came in 15mins after us ordered, ate and left - while we still waited....and waited. When a group of six, who'd arrived 20mins after we'd ordered, got their starters 20 mins later and then all their mains arrived, I saw red. I called over our waiter and told him to forget the pizza. \"I'll check on it,\" he said, which was way too little and far too late. \"No, just forget it, we don't want it. We've sat here waiting while groups of people have come and gone and we've had nothing - it's been over an hour. Forget it, we're done here!\" and with that we upped and left without even leaving any money for the pissy beer. It's rare for me to get that annoyed and I've never left without paying for something. Had he come after us I might have thrown the money at him for the beers (which should have been comped considering our pointless wait) but he didn't. 

Based on many other reviews here, we probably had a lucky escape on the food anyway."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for the food to come. When it arrived it looked like it was sitting in the drivers trunk for two days. Medium pizza and couldn't stomach a single slice. My girlfriend and I are now out $30 and still hungry. Check your pizza before you pay.. really."}
{"text":"The pizza is a soupy mess, the meatballs are watery and flavorless and the AC feels non existent...next"}
{"text":"Just got back from dining at your Sahara Location in Las Vegas. I was with my daughter and her family and placed my own order. The food was OK with the exception of the soda! I ordered a glass of Coca Cola which was watered down. There was no carbonization in the soda. I told the waitress who spoke or understood little English. Told her the soda was flat, she said I don't understand and just walked away. Another server was requested to bring a different drink and that was also flat. The owner/manager came out and told us since all out drinks were missing the carbonization that Coca Cola services and maintains this machine every week! On Monday, I will be in contact with Coca Cola here in Las Vegas regarding this issue. Anyway, when the owner/manager came out with a large bottle of soda for my daughter and family they were drinking sprite. I am not a Sprite fan and he nothing else to offer. I told him I wanted a refund for the drink since I did not consume it. He walked away and never came back. As were finishing dinner I asked about my refund of $2.25 again the owner/manager came over now he was pretty mad at me and told us to never come back. I guess where it is these people come from as it not from the USA to never come back to his place again. I guess where he came from it is ok it rip people by serving watered down drinks. On the way out I thanked him for service and told to look forward to reading my review on Yelp! His last comment was \"What is Yelp\""}
{"text":"I can not believe that this place has ratings so high. I ordered take out tonight and both pastas ordered were way over cooked with almost no sauce. The only bright side is the garlic bread, unfortunately while the bread has potential, the seasoning was wU off."}
{"text":"It's a lovely place to experience, will take you to Napoli and come back :) 

Good food, pricy? Maybe."}
{"text":"Was out for my wife's coworkers' birthday bash at the local bar and they ordered pizza to fill our drunk stomachs. Guess what? I found a new place where I would like to go more often. A lot of pizza places leave you with that heavy feeling. I think mainly cause of the extra thick crust or the tons of toppings which really take away from the actual taste of the pizza. This pizza did remind me of pizza that I had in New York. A little greasy but let me tell you, it was like oil you wanted to drink or lick off your plate. Nasty as that sounds after you ate a slice you might think twice. A thirty inch monster of a pizza did us in. I want one now and that's the truth."}
{"text":"I ordered a BLT and cheesecake for delivery . After 2 hours and 10 minutes I finally just cancelled. I 
 contacted twice but  no reason for the long delay and no apology. And this was a Monday night,not like I placed an order on Superbowl Sunday"}
{"text":"Went there and received undercook chicken to the point it was still bleeding and slimy. The owner of the restaurant was very rude and didnt want to refund us, she said \"this happens all the time. She didnt even apologize not once to us and we were loyal customers! PLEASE DO NOT EAT THERE! YOU MIGHT GET SICK!!"}
{"text":"We usually order their gigantic pizzas for work but I decided to stop in and try their spaghetti and meatballs...it was mediocre at best...service was minimal at best! In the time I was eating three different customers came in...each having problems with being charged extra for what seemed like basic items...I understand everything has to be priced a certain way to make a profit but arguing with the customer over .50 seems a bit ridiculous...besides...we all know pasta is extremely cheap so it's not like they don't make up for that lost .50 anyway! My meal...watery and not much taste...what do I expect...it's not my grandmothers meatballs!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I love the cheese. If your' Ron the mood for a sandwich, try the Philly Cheesesteak. WOW."}
{"text":"In town for work and did not feel like going out.  Maybe it was because I got delivery.  We ordered cheese pizza, wings and ribs.  As I read on other reviews, the ribs are definitely tender but they should bring the bbq sauce they put on the ribs to the quality level of the meat.  The spicy wings were decent and good size...no complaints here.  The bad... the cheese pizza was not edible.  It arrived cold but even warmed up it was a four out of ten at best.  The french fries that come with ribs were limp, no flavor..skip them and get salad.  Overall 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Have to say the last 5 orders I placed have been perfect and consistent!! Had an issue is the past but gave them a second try .. and so happy I did !!! I guess what I'm saying after reading some reviews is give establishments another chance they deserve it !! Oh and how do you make your medium sauce lol soooooo good !!!"}
{"text":"Good service but not the best Italian food. We ordered fried calamari, pizza, and lasagna. We didn't like any of them."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. I ordered a cheese pizza and the pizza was pretty good. The tomato sauce was perfect, the cheese was a good amount. My only thing is that the dough was a bit salty, but not too much. I would order from here agin for delivery, but would rather walk to Mineo's for pizza if I wasn't getting delivery."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the Squirrel Hill pizza shops. You can get a quick slice and pick up a 6 pack as well"}
{"text":"Ordered a taco pizza through Grubhub. Delivery was fast and the order was correct but I did not care for the pizza at all. I felt the crust was too thick and heavy and the taco meat tasted like one of those salty taco seasoning packets. Plus it was pretty greasy. Not a pizza I'd order again & I have no desire to try another kind. Just not for me."}
{"text":"Wings are the best in vegas the sauce is outta this world !!! Pizza is amazing as well . I enjoy coming here the servers are awesome as well ! Highly recommend this place if you're looking for good pizza !"}
{"text":"The 1 star is based on the service.  
This is the 2nd time in 3 weeks that I have tried to call in an order and have been put on hold for over 5 minutes. I don't know if they forgot I'm on hold or what. I called back and got put right back on hold.
Too bad I really liked there pizza & salads.  So long Napoli...."}
{"text":"I love this place because they stay open late and deliver and the food is so yummy!! Haven't tried everything on menu but for a pizza place their burgers are everything! I always order the sunrise and add bacon and sometimes throw pastrami on it and every time it's delicious and hot when it gets to my house!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent and on time like always! Their friendly service is never less than great! I am an eternal customer."}
{"text":"The OC BuckEyes are in town and we decided to take a chance on Napoli and not one complaint got the special 31\" pizza  bucket of wings and 2 2 liter sodas. Kids enjoyed it! I'm happy thanks for taking care of us"}
{"text":"Welllllllll.... Recently, this restaurant was sold to new management. They have made a lot of changes. Unfortunately it made the place less popular if you ask me... there's tons of gnats in the indoor plants, the food made me sick last time, and the service has gone down... 

This used to be the place we ate at 3-4 nights per week, EVERY WEEK, my dad even set up my surprise birthday party here one night and it was absolutely amazing... We established a history here, unfortunately I don't want to go back anymore - I miss the old garlic balls and pizza.... it's sad, but I just miss the old way and old taste..."}
{"text":"First let me say that the food is really good, BUT, service stinks !  Waitstaff is rushed and unfriendly, food took forever to get to our table after waiting 15 minutes for a waitress to take our order.  Then another 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Then another 20 minutes for food.  Then to top it off they double charged our bank card and don't really seem to care.  We called and they said we have to wait till they cash out the register at 5 PM for them to check it.  We gave them all our information and they hung up before we were able to give our phone number for them to call us back. This was our third and last time to eat there and we will never call for deliver again either."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and sandwiches. I recommend trying the sausage and meatball sub. The bread is amazing."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to for probably four years. Unfortunately, it seems that they are too busy and the quality is failing. I don't think that I've seen the same delivery driver twice. 

I have only continued to reorder because every once in a while, they make the best pizza and other amazing food. Unfortunately, more often than not, the pizza comes cold, undercooked, with only a small amount of toppings. There have been times to where I could swear they were serving manufactured dough/cardboard. I literally started ordering online so that I didn't have to deal with the person answering the phone due to broken english. 

I also love their potato skins...when done properly. Most of the time they come severely over or under cooked with two shreds of cheese and one piece of bacon. 

I've had better luck ordering during the day and with their really big pizzas.

Unfortunately, the bad is out weighing the good and will not be reordering for at least while."}
{"text":"Pizza sucks worse than the service. Flat crust,no cheese or sauce,cheap on toppings. Nothing is fresh. Tastes like re heated. Even 7-11 pizza can do better than them!"}
{"text":"Good food,
Good value. 
Good service. 
I have started eating here because of the value. 
Quiet enough to hold a lunch meeting. 
Quick enough to get on your way when needed."}

Oh my god that 30inch pizza is a monster! Just the perfect party food along with the bomb wings!"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will be back ! The food was delicious and didn't take too long. The staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions. The sitting area is spacious and they have tvs going on with sports and other shows. It was a group of us and we try the 30inch pizzas and definitely worth it ."}
{"text":"tried thee combination pizza it was a hit a huge success ... tasted just like the 1 thats back home in Vallejo ca"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were on the way to the bus depot to take the bus back to Ottawa, but wanted to grab one last bite to eat in Montreal. We stumbled across this place after a bit of walking, checked out the huge menu placed outside and walked on in.

There was only one other diner in there at the moment. We sat right by the window and asked for a margarita pizza to split. Although when it did arrive it was basically just a cheese pizza.

None the less, it was pretty darn good. The crust was perfect; not too thin, but not too thick. There was garlic and olive oil brushed along the crust of the pizza which was fantastic. Sauce was good and cheese was nice and gooey. I loved sprinkling chili peppers and Parmesan on the pizza which they had out on the table.

Decor was interesting, with lots of unique Italian pieces and touches. Almost made you feel like you were invited into the owners home and he was cooking for you. 

The one turn off was that we were told that their credit machines were acting up and cash would be preferred, although we never heard this mentioned to the next patrons. 

Pizza was also more expensive than we thought, I think with tax and tip we paid about $26.00.

What I really liked was that they had a yelp sticker on their door! *YAY*

A nice place to visit if you are looking for a legit pizza."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Napoli Pizzeria several times since my last less than stellar review and I'm seriously impressed. The wait time for delivery has lessened a bit, but more importantly, everything is always done right. Every order has been correct, nothing missing, all condiments and 'extras' present, and everything is fresh and delicious. I swear even the fries have gotten better (though I can't speak for the chili).

While this store's menu is still comparable to a hundred others in the city, they do it noticeably better than most. The food is good and the service has improved. Hopefully I won't ever need to contact them about a complaint again, but I imagine it would be handled well at this point.

Napoli burgers are some of the best you can have delivered to your door. Seriously, they are legit, as are the chicken wings. I'm at a point now where I will recommend Napoli to friends.

Keep doing what you're doing, guys, and I'll keep ordering."}
{"text":"In town Tried to order  late night delivery but the person taking the calls was so rude I couldn't justify giving them my business."}
{"text":"Review based upon late night delivery...

The pizza is decent.  It was delivered fresh and hot, but the quality of the topping ingredients weren't the best.  The crust is probably the highlight for me, with a good amount of chewiness and not at all burnt or limp.  The pizza I *may* order again, but nothing else.

No matter how desperate your craving, do not order the \"Childrens Macaroni & Cheese.\"  The portion size was good, but it was dry and some noodles still crunchy.  Cheese not quality.

Also stay away from the dessert... the \"strawberry shortcake\" was really a slice of cake, which looked and felt like it had been left out for a week.  Spongy and disgusting.  The same goes for the zeppolis which were hard and seemed old."}
{"text":"is the best pizza I've ever had in Las Vegas Nevada you might want to go check out this place that's  highly recommend it it's off of Decatur and Sahara I just got the regular pepperoni and the Greek salad it is off the hook I love this place service is great everything  is fresh prices are just right thanks again guys I'll see you Doon"}
{"text":"Can't believe only getting 3 stars. I've been going for years. One of the best pizzas in Vegas. Cheese has amazing flavor just like everything in menu. 
Try the Napoli burger too. Best burger I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot for great Italian food. Kids love the pizza and wings.  They have remodeled the place and it looks great. Well done :)"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée une fois avec mon chum et on avait été terriblement déçus par la qualité versus le prix. Et nous avons été horripilés par l'intense décoration.

J'y suis retournée avec mon père il y a peu, et nous avons été reçus par le patron personnellement. La bouffe était bonne, le menu midi est peu cher... J'ai probablement jugé trop vite. Il me faudrait une 3e visite pour valider ma note de 3 étoiles.

Un joueur de violon le soir, c'est ok, mais c'est un peu gossant quand tu veux jaser gentiment et que tu as l'impression qu'il va t'écoeurer jusqu'a ce que tu lui laisses un pourboire. C'est cute, fancy et tout.. mais pas tout le temps."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza place in Las Vegas! I've had their pizza twice and it's amazing! If you like to dip your pizza in ranch dressing, like I do, then you're in for a treat. Their ranch dressing is delicious and the portion is massive. Both times I ordered through their site online. It was easy to use. Their customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The good is always good. Fresh salads and great pizza. We order the wings crispy and they are always just right. However, Flor, the girl who last took our order on the phone is so rude. She was in such a hurry and when she read me back my order I questioned it and she told me I had to be more specific. Then she made it seem like I was wrong by asking questions. She should be placed somewhere else in the establishment, away from people, since she obviously isn't happy with her job."}
{"text":"I have went here 2 times for pizza, and have not succeeded in getting anything. The first time I went was on a weekend. The lady informed me that they do not serve slices over the weekend. Then said sorry and watched as I left. I ended up taking my business to the Chamango snack shop around the corner. \"Great business by the way\" I felt as though they did not want to serve me. I decided to go on my lunch break that following Wednesday. I walked in and stood there waiting to be assisted. It had been at least 5 minutes and there were at least 7 people behind the counter. 4 up front and 3 in the back. All acting as if they are doing something in an empty restaurant on a Wednesday around 5pm. I walk up to the guy after he signaled me and ask for a slice of pizza. He tells me they stop serving slices at 3pm. He did not offer anything to me. I looked at him with great disappointment. As I turned away and walked down the way to the Chamango establishment, who appreciated me coming in. Neither of the employees offered me something else. Neither employee asked or even compromised with me to make me a happy customer that would return. I could have been talked into buying a full pizza with wings, and garlic knots; on how hungry I was. Granted I would have shared the food with others, and recommended this place to eat. Because of the shitty service and how I felt. I will never step foot into this place again. For what it's worth, I hope this place shuts down and builds on their customers service. I felt like because of the person I am, they did not want to, nor felt the need to serve me. Then I see that there are 3 stars, now I know why. Napoli pizza's customers service is straight garbage."}
{"text":"So, how would I end up in Montreal at the Napoli Pizzeria?  Who knows really, maybe it was the large gathering of other nerds who were in town to talk to each other about get this (babies, development, and psychopathology).  I know right.  What the heck does that have to do with traveling all the way to Napoli.  Well, it really has nothing to do with that but it really justifies the long trip from New Orleans to here.

About the venue, it's cute, small, and has a large tree placed right in the middle of the room.  This tree is adorned with glowing grapes that if your lucky are all flickering.

The food, I started my night with the french onion soup, and it was unlike any other kind I've ever had.  It was slightly sweet but in a different way than most.  It wasn't bogged down with cheese like some are so that was nice too.

We also ordered a pizza that was delicious and nicely cooked.  The pizzas are larger than you would think and if you are with someone else they will split whatever you order on two plates so you even get your own servings!

We ordered the medium and we both had two full pieces to take home.  So, if you go with someone else you could get away with the small pizza and a salad, or soup or something alike.

Good little place found at random while visiting MOntreal!"}
{"text":"Great environment always get greeted as soon as we walk in the door. The customer service is phenomenal the server kept checking in on us through out our meal..Overall great service"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday it's been awhile since I ate from this particular Napoleons pizza but I love the inside they got a big space for you and your party to eat at and you can even eat outside love it. When it comes to the deals they always seem to have a special going on the particular day of whatever the deal maybe which is good if your not looking to spend too much on food. As for the food I had the chicken wings although not the best and they were a little over cooked I still enjoyed them the fries were fresh and crispy and tasty and not the fries you get at a place like angelinas pizza place where the fries are overcooked and inedible here they cook them fresh and they are really good and I enjoyed them overall. I see myself either ordering from here again or eating inside the staff are really friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in Vegas! They have many locations and they deliver! The wings are crispy and they have multiple different seasonings and flavors. I usually prefer hot wings but before I ordered they warned me that hot was a little spicier than other places. THANK GOD for the warning! Even medium was a little too spicy for me but the wings are addicting. Also the wings have the options of coming with fries..get them, they are incredible! They aren't average fries. They are seasoned, super crunchy, and always come out hot!  Strongly recommend eating here. The inside is clean, modern, and a great environment with friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is always so good,  never a disappointment!  Only thing is ordering over the phone it's hard to hear them but the important thing is the food is always so good and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but it takes forever to make after the cashier tells you that the pizza would take about 20-25 mins and it took almost 40mins and the costumer service it poor need to work on welcome the people at least."}
{"text":"Napoli Pizzeria.. home of the 30\" pizza!! We had a blast watching them make these and slide them into the ginormous delivery bag. We got half hawaiian, half pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom. The pizza was fantastic, we'd definitely go there again, no question. My husband is a wings guy and he enjoyed them, though he can never get his wings spicy enough, so naturally, he didn't think they were as hot as he would have liked. 

Fun atmosphere, too... our waitress was really nice and let us take a picture with her and a 30\" pizza for fun. The staff is great.. laughing and joking with everyone. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!  I ordered it for delivery. They were on time and the pizza was very good. It was a realy homemade pizza. Thank you Napoli. My family and I will order it again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza place in Squirrel Hill and maybe in Pittsburgh! My wife and I used to order from Mineos, which is also excellent, but decided to switch it up the one night. We were so glad we did! The pizza and cheese fries are amazing and we love that they use the smaller pepperonis on their pizza. They're always prompt when they deliver and we have never been disappointed with the food or service!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are great, great variety and this is really what is the main attraction. It's like alot of other places in Vegas (Angelinas, Cafe Verdi etc.) They have everything you could ever think of on the menu. Fried Mushrooms, Zuchinni sticks, Jalapeno Poppers etc. I have had their pizza before, its good. So opted for a lunch special. Philly, Fries and a drink. Great price, but nothing stood out to me with the Philly. I don't know if its because I work for a place where we make our own bread, but the bread wasn't that great, very airy, like there was no substance or flavor to it. The beef itself was so-so, had a very mild taste to it, when combined with mushrooms and peppers. It was like they hardly put seasonings on it. If you're looking for a place that has a great pizza, and with a huge variety of other entrees and appetizers, this is the place, I am sure there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"The service is horrible the refill in the same cup and they don't pay attention to you so rude and disrespectful"}
{"text":"I have to say nothing was bad about this pizza place but also nothing jumps out at you as special. The staff was friendly. The place looked clean. If I am in the area again and craving pizza I would eat here again. So I give this place a solid three stars"}
{"text":"Well they price me at one price and then when they got here 70 minutes later when they're only point five miles away they charged me extra and the food was half cold definitely will not order from them again definitely better places to eat at late night"}
{"text":"Special thanks to the crew at Napoli's West Sahara for helping make our Grand Opening at LVCT a special occasion."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed that I could not select zero stars out of five because this is all this place deserves. My Italian DNA died a little bit tonight when I got served a pizza which smelled exactly like the restaurant itself. It was anything but pizza, just a wild combination of some soft flat bread topped with a weird combination that was supposed to be a \"Quattro stagioni\". When we got the bill and we paid cash our waiter did not bring us any change. I had to point that out to have the change back not only in a rude way but with the change itself made dirty by pieces of meat and tomato sauce on it. I left very little as a tip, and another waiter came and first told us to pay the bill and not give them a little change as a bill. When I pointed out that we actually already paid our bill and that was the tip, he got pissed saying that it was an offence to the cook. Anyway, he was not even our waiter. I left the place very disappointed, suggesting a few people grouping outside and looking at the menu to go away."}
{"text":"This place has good pizza, however their customer service sucks. They don't know how to apologize. Pizza My Dear is now our pizza of choice."}
{"text":"Didnt have the pizza but it looked incredible.  The Italian wedding soup was off the chain. Try the parmesan garlic chick wings, pretty good and great service."}
{"text":"Our office ordered a 30\" pizza for lunch w/ mild hot wings. We got 1/2 meat lovers, 1/2 supreme and it was delicious! Huge ass pizza barely fit through the door when the guy was trying to deliver it. Their wings are bomb! They are fat and juicy. Steroid wings! haha. Will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it says about Vegas that this delicious pizza place is run entirely by Russians who can't possibly be turning a profit, but I'll eat there happily nonetheless!

Most come here for the takeout special: 16\", 1 topping glorious ness for a mere $7. Really can't be beat. Add in a massive salad ($6-10) to pretend you're being healthy, and you've got dinner for like, five people. 

I ate two slices  and a good portion if the salad and was stuffed. Their price for size/value is good. 

Service was friendly and fast. Packed plates and utensils with out takeout order, along with cheese and peppers, which was a nice touch.

Ordered the Greek salad, think I accidentally got the gyro salad by mistake. It it was still great. Would get again- fresh, crunchy salad with plenty of meat and cheese, and an entire tomato! Pizza hot and fresh, good sauce that wasn't too sweet, crust was thin but still had some crunch to it."}
{"text":"It's average pizza.  At a real good price.  Didn't like the pasta much though.  Ask for extra sauce and it made the pizza much better cuz they barely put any on.  Can't beat the pick up special price though!"}
{"text":"Dry boneless chicken wings. Which I still ate, but can't deal with the rude employees. They all running around like chickens with their heads off. We were asked if we were helped yet by 3 people but the fourth one finally helped us. But when she did.... big attitude. Not going back."}
{"text":"The food is great, the wings, salad and pizza is to die for.. the lunch menu is A1.. the only down fall is the delivery service is really bad.. it takes more then a 1.5 hrs to deliver a salad.. understandable its around lunch time but we have missed numerous lunches with the slow delivery...fix that and they could get 5 stars"}
{"text":"Pro: Food is great, definitely get the garlic knots.  Pizza cant be beat, hamburgers are awesome as well.  Service is great, our server was very attentive.
Con:  They recently remodeled, and the restaurant is very LOUD.  Imagine trying to order food in a night club, server right next to me and We could not communicate.  All hard surfaces, very echoey, music blasting over head, other tables having to yell to be heard made conversation at out table all but impossible.
I suggest get the food to go and get out asap."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at Napoli pizzeria every Thursday for over three months. By this time, you would think we'd all be sick of Napoli, but the taste never gets old. Every time we've gone there, the food has come out fairly quickly, and has always been very good. There are only two things that i dislike about Napoli; the pizza is overly greasy in my opinion, and the restaurant can get a loud at times, but not so loud that it becomes unenjoyable. I would recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm here for lunch alone and I ordered a Lobster served with spaghetti. The lobster is a little salty for me but everything else is good. The bread they served before the meal is fresh and good. Overall the service is good basically and the food is too, the environment is comfortable and relaxing, but the waiter already chose 15% tips for me when I asked for the Debit machine and I couldn't see the amount of money as he already skipped that step for me, which is either careless or bad service at this particular part. This place is worth coming after all."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Just not as good as Mineo's . The place is really small! I wish that they were as big as Mineo's."}
{"text":"I had a major Pizza craving today thinking I could easily eat 1/2 pizza. Lol First time I've ordered from them. Such great quality & I was surprised how big the pizza was & they give You a good amount of toppings. I can eat ALOT but was so full ...I ate half the spinach salad which was so so good & 2 1/2 pieces of the pizza! I ordered the 4 topping & added extra olives & green peppers. From other pizza  places I can easily eat 1/2 a pizza. The 16\" would definitely be enough for 3-4 of me  so tasty I highly recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the Best in town.  If your visiting and didnt stop by your missing out !!
Best pizza crust toppings variety is off the chain!   Stuffed Grape leaves moist n full of flavor!"}
{"text":"The pizza was disgusting I took two bites and threw it away the garlic balls were OK and the Hot wings were good. I will never order from this place again took 1 hour and 35 minutes for me to get my food and the food was just horrible"}
{"text":"I tried this placed based only on my friends recommendation and it went beyond expectations. Their wings are big and they give you way more than you can eat I ordered the hot and mango habanero and they blew me away. Their prices are reasonable and you get so much food for what you pay for. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Thee best wings in Vegas!    Every flavor is awesome but be sure to try mango habanero and garlic parmesan.    Cesar salad is really good too.  Once you have their ranch and Cesar dressings you won't like any others.    They also have huge amazing pizzas.  Come try it and you will be addicted like we are :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery it came promptly and was packaged well.
My husband loved his margarita pizza (he likes any pizza so I can't really count his opinion. I love brownies and have never met a brownie I didn't like). I tried his pizza , it was good except it barely had any sauce. I ordered ziti with marinara sauce and a side of meatballs. My ziti sauce was sooooooo salty and again little sauce. Meatballs were bland and had a 2 cups of sauce. What ?!?!?!?... 
My garlic bread was cold and dry, I didn't taste much garlic.
Sooooo I will try again but order nothing wih their sauce. I will stick to wings and fries.
If I owned an Italian restaurant I would have 3 sauce types. Sweet Basil Marinara, salty-spicy bolognese, white wine Alfredo. 
If you don't have your Italian sauce correct than you don't have a gold medal. You've basically just happy your in the game."}
{"text":"Food was great. But the order was wrong. I ordered half pound burgers and was charged for (and got) one pound burgers. I also ordered a 10 inch pizza and was charged for (and got) a 14 inch pizza. It was WAAAAAYYY more food than I needed MUCH more than I wanted to spend. I was so tired from driving and the heat it didn't click at the time of payment. When we got the food back to the hotel room it was a shock. We couldn't finish it all and our hotel didn't have a fridge to keep it in. Most of it got thrown out. So expensive, so wasteful. But the food really really was good."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and was told it would be a 45 minute wait. It took two hours for it to be done. No one was wearing hair nets and I found hair in one of the slices. The crust was paper thin and the pizza was undercooked. It tasted off and all the toppings, including the cheese, fell right off the slices. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Yuck. You let me down, Yelp. I'm new to the area and haven't found all the good pizza places yet, I'm very disappointed with the quality of the pizza here. They don't use fresh ingredients - a slop of frozen spinach and canned mushrooms piled high on a salty pizza. Won't be getting pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Greasy, that is the best way to describe... if you are up for quantity and very little quality, come eat here, you'll like it. May be a good decision if you have to feed a lot of people, but not for someone looking to fall in love with the pizza. Wings are not that good either."}
{"text":"Lately their pizza has been hit or miss. Last night was a miss. The pizza was greasy and the pepperoni had no flavor.  If they changed their cheese or pepperoni they need to change back. From now on I will stick with Marco's - their old school pepperoni is always on-time."}
{"text":"I have ordered their pizza for parties at Desert Breeze Pool for years.  Great pizza!  However, the person taking the order was an IDIOT!  First, don't call me \"honey\".  I'm not your \"honey\".  I'm an adult.  Second, you should know where Desert Breeze pool is without an actual address.  It's a great big building at the corner of Spring Mtn and Durango.  Third, you should also know that Desert Breeze Pool address is NOT going to be my billing address for my credit card.  Consider hiring someone else to answer phones."}
{"text":"Delivery took about 70 mins unfortunately, food was decent but not spectacular. Ended up ordering for delivery after landing late at night; got the kids pasta with red sauce, side of cream sauce, cheesy bread bites and an antipasto salad. I can't eat much in a single sitting but I like variety, lol! Took me 4 meals to finish of my feast."}
{"text":"Great filling food my whole family loves Napoli Pizzeria and their food is always filling."}
{"text":"I've yet to get something from this Pizza place that is actually good. Someone must hate working there."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Napoli for almost 5 years, ordering delivery at LEAST once a month.  Sure, they may have a long wait time, be a bit privy, and have forgotten part of my order at the store before, but I've always dealt with it because frankly, they're accommodating and give you a LOT of food.  However, tonight showed me just how little they care about their customers.  I have never had a problem ordering multiple flavors on my chicken fingers or upgrading (for a hefty fee) regular fries to curly fries, but tonight I was flat out told \"no\" and that it was \"company policy.\"  Upon calling back to cancel my order, I didn't even get an apology.  I work face-to-face with customers at a fortune-500 company and know that a good rule of thumb is that even if you can't accommodate a customer,  to at LEAST apologize for it.  I am seriously sad to say I can no longer be a Napoli customer due to their severely poor customer service skills, and I hope others will stand to not put up with it either."}
{"text":"I work kinda late shift, and after getting a customer for an hour and a half, i wanted to order a pizza to eat while i waited. I called them, and while the service was fine, all I ordered was a large pepperoni, and they charged me $20.45. I decided that I was hungry enough, and agreed to use my card to pay. I uncomfortably read out pretty much all my card info to them (and rest assured, i will be checking my charges), and it was then that I found out it would take an hour and 25 minutes to deliver. I have no idea what you need an hour for, but late night delivery should be faster with less customers. The worst part was I found this out after they had all my credit card info, if I'd known the time first, I would've canceled, but with my info, you might as well have called it a hostage situation, When the food arrived 1 hour and 45 minutes later, i was alone and annoyed, so you can imagine my annoyance when i had to direct the driver to my address, even though I had given it over the phone, When he finally got to me, he imprinted my card (now they have image and all its info) and gave me the pizza, which was hot and delicious. I won't harp on the food, but they reallly have to up their service to get me to order again, No matter how good the food is, I'm not risking random charges and waiting 2 hours for a single pizza. Cmon Napoli, you can do better than this."}
{"text":"Amazing service with jessica food was terrific and ended up running into Fernando Vargas how could it get better??"}
{"text":"Love Napoli!! We always ordered from here on night shift!! 30 in pizzas !! So good and great specials love their gyros and cheesesteaks"}
{"text":"Ordered a $14 bleu cheese burger... Dry af! The meat has no flavor at all and  the other cheese looks like it was melted on top then left out to dry up which is probably what happened since we waited 45 minutes for this disgusting burger. My fries were all soggy limp and full of grease. I tried to save them with ketchup only to realize there wasnt even any salt put on them! Ice heard good things about this place so im double disappointed. 

Also just to order one family size pizza with a topping other than just cheese... Look into spending about $30. Ridiculous for a pizza. And the cashier lady was rude and like rushed for me to order and it wasn't even busy.

I feel like for prices as high as theirs is, the ambiance should be better, the service definitely needs training on customer service and the food needs flavor and a definite quality boost. If my experience was this bad and it wasnt even busy... I hate to see them during a dinner rush."}
{"text":"This place has always had good tasting pizza and wings. Can never go wrong here. I've never had a problem with these guys. I love that they deliver late too, perfect for me since i work graveyard. The prices are good here, so many choices and everything always comes hot"}
{"text":"Those late night cravings are always satisfying. I love this place .pizza is so fresh and delicious and cheesy !!!! . Try the garlic balls those are really good ."}
{"text":"I love Napoli's!!! They are our go to for hoagies. I almost always order the fish hoagie but I have tried several on their menu including the italian, eggplant parm, and chicken parm. If I'm in the mood I will grab a slice of pizza. I love that they sell slices and you don't have to get a whole pie. I've had plain, Hawaiian, mushroom and several others. They do not disappoint. 
Seating is limited inside and it looks like what you would expect from a pizza shop. We typically call ahead to order and I pick it up. Parking is a complete pain in squirrel hill so I park at the bank across the road and run in to the pizza shop. I have never had to wait on my order- usually ready in 20 minutes. One thing to note- they do not deliver to Regent Square during rush hour. Im surprised anyone does though. Driving down Forbes at 5pm is the worst!!! 
Anyways, get a hoagie here..they are awesome!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with Napolis. Their food is a bit hit or miss as others have mentioned. Also, it seems like sometimes they switch up their ingredient vendors. But when it's good, it's good. 

The pizza is thin crust and can be greasy. When delivery takes too long, the bottom tends to get soggy which is gross. So it's definitely better to dine in or pick up.  Also, they have a ridiculously large 30\" square pizza that barely fit through the front door!

We've ordered other misc items such as zeppolis and the buffalo chicken salad, which are both delicious.  The pasta was okay, but not exceptional, but it tends to be a better option for delivery. The Strombolis and calzones are  super cheesy and don't seem to get soggy like the pizza when delivered. 

I've ordered via phone and eat24. Usually get put on hold when calling in. And delivery takes a while when delivered both ways. It usually takes then 45min-1hr+ (usually more) to deliver. 

Bottom line: I like their food, but it's greasy pizza that can backfire (soggy crust) if you're getting it delivered, which can take 1hr+."}
{"text":"They take forever I thought take out will be faster but Noooooo it's almost the same as delivery fkn sucks just stick to delivery or dine in"}
{"text":"There food is amazing however after my horrible experience today with having my food delivered I will not be doing any business with them in the future.the manager Angela has no customer service skills as she kept speaking over me and would not address my concern.honestly disappointed with my experience today"}
{"text":"I have been coming to napolis for the past two years, and   The only thing that keeps me coming back are they're hot  bone in wings. I know that's peculiar I'm only coming in and ordering wings. But they're wings are the pengest in The Valley. I'm obsessed with hot wings and this place satisfies my craving. I always place my order through the phone because that way when I arrive it's ready. They're always courteous and provide good customer service. I'm going back again this weekend, they're probably like this girl is addicted to wings. I am and for as long as you stand, I will always buy wings from napolis. Dare to try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. Quite possibly the rudest people I've ever met. I ordered $110 of pizza to be delivered. One pizza was dairy free due to food allergies. When it was delivered 1 hour ten minutes later 1/2 of the dairy free had cheese. When I called and asked for a credit they gave me two options. 1/2 half credit for the part that was incorrect or pick up the pizza and replace it in 30+ minutes. I asked for the manager and he was verbally abusive.  Did not acknowledge their mistake or the fact that they jeopardized my health with bad product. 

15 minutes later the driver appeared to pick up the pizza saying they would replace it but I'd still be charged for the pizza.  Unbelievable. 

The other pizzas were wet and soggy. Extremely poor service and lousy product. Avoid this place. 

I called my credit card company and disputed the charges. I'm not paying for crappy food and abusive staff."}
{"text":"Had a room full of hungry kids, decided to order a 30 inch pizza. What a great choice, pizza was delicious and plenty enough for everyone at a reasonable price. I asked them if they can deliver straight to our room (Mirage) and within the hour it was here. Will be Ordering from here next time we are here!"}
{"text":"Pizza arrived within one hour. Tip and delivery fee were lowest compared to other pizza restaurants in the area. Bf and I enjoyed the pizza and would probably order from Napoli again when we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything here is great. We order carry out for the specials and haven't ordered much other than the pizza. My only problem ill pass along is, if you order a cannoli make sure you ask them to please have the guy fill it. This is my second order this month, the first i thought it was just a mistake, but Friday I got another empty one. Its a lot to charge for an empty shell MORE THAN ONCE! This seems to be hit ir miss...i order from a NW pizza place and until I mentioned it, the same thing was happening. Its a lot of empty too!
Outside of that they are great!!!"}
{"text":"Tough place to review since I went with 6 people and the results were wildly different amongst us. We went for lunch and that brings me to main positive comment which is their special: 2 giant slices with cheese or pep with a drink for $5.99. I did wait a little long for mine, but when I got it I would say it was decent. When very hot it was pretty good although greasier than many. After cooling off it wasn't really worth eating. Some of the party liked it, but overall nothing special and I have to rate it low mostly for the service. I've never been to a pizza place that took this long to serve pizza. Also, one person who came a bit later and ordered a little after us waited 35 minutes for her sandwich and when we were ready to leave she was told that it would be 10 more minutes. So, she got her money back and had someone else's leftover pizza."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing.  The employees /owners are terrible at customer service.  They are hateful and like to argue back and never smile.   Just hope you don't have questions or special needs"}
{"text":"Now THIS is pizza ! By far the best pizza I have tried in Vegas ! Amazing ! Everything was exceptional ! The customer service was beyond my expectations everyone was so nice and welcoming and made sure to check on us frequently ! They gave huge portions of food & for such an awesome price ! This has officially become my go to pizza place ! I will definitely be coming back and referring all my family, friends, and coworkers ! Thank you Napoli pizza for an amazing food experience !"}
{"text":"Cheese breaks apart in your mouth. There is no stretch to the cheese. Cheap cheese.

Also there is not enough sauce and the crust isn't crispy enough. 

Would try someplace else."}
{"text":"As I sit here enjoying my pizza I must tell you I'm a critic. I grew up in new haven ct and nyc the 2 pizza capitals of the world. 

This place was great! Nothing like the rest of PA. 

I moved to pa and had given up. The store bought sauce, the undercook dough the many things they called pizza that disappointed me turned me to a frozen pizza guy to get in my cravings for this Italian American staple in my life. 

The owner here should be proud. The cheese was great. The sauce wonderful and the crust perfect. The cheese slice I had was great. 

I do have to say the canned mushrooms on the mushroom and pepperoni I had were chewy and I'll pass next time but the cheese slice was on point. 

Bravo."}
{"text":"My favorite \"on the go\" pizza spot. I can always really on Napoli's for a good \"Friday night\" dinner with family. I ordered the largest pizza and it did stop everyone from being hungry. Quality wise I would grade it a C but the quantity sure makes up for it especially if you're feeding a hungry family."}
{"text":"I ordered the same pizza about a week ago and was really impressed. This time I got an old pizza that has obviously been reheated. It's cold and the crust is a little burnt and rock hard, not at all edible."}
{"text":"I always get this pizza delivered but today we decide to come in..and this pizza was extra delicious,service was great specially the lady that turn off the lights and sang birthday to one of the kids...pizza delicious,service is great"}
{"text":"Yuck again. Reminded me of BAD high school cafeteria pizza. Aiello's and Mineo's are both better"}
{"text":"Normally I love the service whether pick up or delivery. However last night was the worst service ever and because I didn't call to complain last night after I already had to call and remind them twice it's been over an hour and half and no food and second because the driver forgot my pizza with the order. I was already upset and figured I will call tomorrow and complain because I've called and complained enough last night. Well the good folks said ma'am on your 47 dollar order because you did not call us back and complain even more last night; today the best we can do is credit you four whole dollars to your next order. Do better next time in taking a lot more responsibility for the error of your staff. Your driver got lost then forgot the pizza and then yall send out the same pizza that should have been here damn near two hours ago. Come on now do better."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  I paid  44.00 for a 30 inch pizza.  An hour later still not here after told it would b 45 minutes.  I called, the told me order was not in system.  Told them I paid  on phone for it.  The found it and said it's still in the oven and takes about an hour.  So another 30 minutes.  I will not use them again and told guy I'd yelp it, he hung up on me.  What an axxhole!  I should have ordered from naked city pizza instead.  Very aggravated.  Many of my guests have left or leaving now.  Thanks napolis for the crappy customer service and helping to ruin my event!"}
{"text":"After one of our longest days touring the city, we were craving carbs in a big way. We sat on the terrace and enjoyed the liveliness of the Latin Quarter. Our server was tri-lingual, which is amazing to this mono-lingual American. Kids had Hawaiian pizza (one of 82 options), my parents had lasagna and fettucine, hubs had arrabiata and I had gnocci ala gigi (onion, pancetta and mushroom in vodka sauce). All were solid. They were also generous with the bread and the sangria was tasty. It made for a nice way to cap off our day."}
{"text":"Wonder service I love all there food great personality will always be a life time customer"}
{"text":"So disappointing.  All I ordered was a steak salad and 12 chicken. I asked for all drumsticks which is all I eat. I got 3 drumsticks...  It took over an hour to get my food and the wings weren't even warm. The Napolis in Henderson blows this one away. I'm striking out this week!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're from So.Cal and know 'bout Pizza Mania (Whittier) ya know whassup! Def. must hit up this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and meatballs too.   They catered an event for us top quality food and service with a very competitive price."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!!!!!! Large pepperoni pizza with a slice of strawberry cheesecake! Yummy"}
{"text":"The peperonni on our pizza tasted old. The crust was too chewy. I found a hair on my pizza and it was blonde. My hair is not blonde. The fries were too chewy, like they had been reheated. The only decent thing we ordered was the ranch. I would NEVER go back here again. Their prices are good but I would rather pay more for better quality."}
{"text":"This place is horrible and I recommend that you never order from this place again. I ordered delivery and after over an hour I had to call them and the idiot on the phone kept stumbling over his words and would only say \"well we kept trying to contact you\" when my phone never rang and he never apologized once. I'm so upset."}
{"text":"I have loved Napoli's for so long I can't remember when I first actually walked through the door.  Here is the problem.  I am at work and super hungry because I didn't have time to make dinner before I got here and I work nights.  I ordered a small 8 cut pizza, one order of fries and a 12 ounce can of mountain dew and he tells me that will be $19.80.  I ask you, is this a fair price?  The driver got there and I asked him, what is the delivery charge and do they add in a tip?  He says, no and no.  I didn't want to stiff the driver, so I gave him a few dollars for the tip, eventhough it took them 48 minutes to get here and I am right in Squirrell Hill.  That's in the same area, basically right around the corner.  The pizza had some cheese that was missing and some was sliding off of the pizza.  uggghhh, that's my pet peeve!  I am seriously not ordering from these people ever again."}
{"text":"5 effin stars! Looking for great pizza and beer! And did I forget to say chicken wings! Best pizza in town! Great medium wings! Fries for only a dollar! And wash it down with a blue moon.. Good times! Friendly staff and fresh food! Need more?"}
{"text":"They use to have the best cheese pizza in the whole of Vegas! Me and my husband would get at least four a week UNTIL recently. Due to cut backs or for whatever reasons they have reduced the pizza to next to nothing! No cheese and its so thin and sharp now it cut my mouth. if you bring back the old cheese pizza i will remove this review we miss it so much."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Napoli's. When I've got a hankering for wings or chicken fingers, they can't be beat. They're Garlic balls are also fantastic, cheap, and filling! They've also got a great response time for delivery. However, that's where the love portion dies.

Working across the street at a busy call center means that any day of the weeks has four or five people ordering. They've got this giant pizza that is popular with pot lucks. However, I can say I've never seen a greasier pizza in my entire life. Bring a roll of paper towels so you can get it all off. Same goes with the Calzones.

Their delivery guys are also super rude. I got some food from them the other day and I wanted to smack the dude who delivered. Asked me to sign the receipt and when I asked if he had a pen, all he said was, \"No,\" and then gave me a look full of sullen attitude. They're always like that. They may be hot, but it doesn't mean they get to be dicks."}
{"text":"I'd be willing to try Napoli again because of the great reviews... I feel like I'm missing something.  I'd probably only try by the slice though...

SALTY.  It was so so salty that I stopped eating before I was full.  It was also reallllly greasy, like pools of grease sitting in the pepperonis and dripping off the slices.

Maybe got a bad pie? It looked pretty good. Need a while to sweat out the salt before I try this place again though."}
{"text":"So good, great value. Deep dfish is the bomb! Definitely will eat there again when visiting where they have one!!"}
{"text":"I am gonna keep this short and sweet this place hands down is the best joint I have been to for pizza in Las Vegas try the BBQ chicken my fav"}
{"text":"My go to pizza place especially when I'm at work. The wings are delicious  spicy honey barbecue are my favorite this month lol. The pizza is yummy too but that ranch dressing they are serving is crack for real. sometime I go in there just to order condiments. 

Love Me Some Napoli's LoL"}
{"text":"In our 3 day stay in Las Vegas, we went to Napoli Pizza twice.  Had the same pizza 2x's (mushroom and sausage).  First time we had the Italian salad ($9.99)...huge!  The second time we thought we'd have smaller salad so we ordered the small anti pasta salad for $6.50 - it was impressive.  I love the chilled lettuce in the salad.  We had the balsamic dressing and totally enjoyed the salad and the amazing pizza.  Highly recommend it!  They definitely get really busy with take out orders from 5pm - the pizza is great the prices are great so go figure....you may have to wait a bit, they can't help that they are so popular!"}
{"text":"Great place fast delivery food is reasonably priced, there pizza and burgers are good here and very filling"}
{"text":"Delicious and friendly atmosphere. I moved to Montreal a month ago and have been craving Lasagne. I found the perfect spot! Nice, warm and cozy for a late night date with my Love. The staff is very friendly and the prices were reasonable. I will be back for the pizza!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here late at night now that I get off work at 1am, and the employees have always been nice and the food just as good..... good to see people are in a good mood at 1am when at work."}
{"text":"Local pizza shop providing excellent food for 40 years.  Pizza, hoagies, pasta dinners, salads, etc.  They also have cuts available all day if you just need a quick snack.  Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Loved there wings super fire. Pizza is great and cheesy and just always perfect. Recommend."}
{"text":"Had been a semi-frequent customer of Napolis due to takeout specials and occasionally good pizza.  However, the rude service we got yesterday will be the last time we go there. I heard my husband order the mushroom topping, but when we got home with our pizza, we had a pepperoni pizza. My husband spoke to someone named Angela, and explained the situation and asked if they could do something for us as we did not want to drive back to get a new pizza. She said she KNEW we ordered pepperoni but they would deliver a new pizza to us for free! Great, right?  Well, a minute later our phone rang and Angela was calling to argue again that we've always ordered pepperoni and did this time too! She insisted that we ordered the wrong pizza but she would deliver us a new pizza, as if we were idiots and she never made a mistake. Her bad attitude was unbelievable and confrontational!! My husband was as nice as can be to her and was not expecting to argue over a pizza topping.  And other reviewers are correct. You get alot of stares from employees when you walk in and are ignored for quite awhle before you are even spoken to. There are too many good pizza places in town to deal with such rudeness. Not to mention the fact that the pizzas are sometimes raw and undercooked or in the case of our pepperoni pizza yesterday burnt on the edges. So long Napolis and get rid of that rude worker Angela!!!!"}
{"text":"Broccoli cheddar soup is awesome!!!! Gotta try it . It's actually white cheese instead of yellow such a great taste !:)"}
{"text":"Love it. Mom and I went around 10 am only two other customers beside us. Service was quick and delicious."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! They have a 16\" lunch special pizza with one topping for $7.99 which is enough for two normal eaters. They also have a 30\" pizza! The cheese steak sub was also very good. Nice friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I'm visiting family. The best pizza and the most amazing mozzarella sticks. I like the ambiance. Eating here makes me nostalgic for my childhood. You definitely won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Just order takeout from here I ordered a Philly cheese steak it was so dry didn't have enough cheese  and it didn't have that much flavor I'm so disappointed subway probably has better Philly cheese steaks very disappointed"}
{"text":"Pizza is mostly dough. Had a tough time finding good local pizza delivered. These guys were the first that popped up. Gave them unit number but still had to walk to reception area to get it. Ordered through Grubhub so maybe they are part to blame, as delivered menu looks different. Still would not order again. If I want a doughnut I'll go to the bakery."}
{"text":"There's a couple things wrong here because I'm not one to leave bad reviews very often. We dined in and this was our first time here. We sat ourselves and waited about 10 minutes to be greeted. They brought out my wife's food first, then about 7 minutes later they brought out mine, pretty much making my wife's food cold by the time we ate. My pizza was way too greasy. They were unsure on how to apply the free garlic balls checkin coupon, so they had to take my phone to show there manager, which didn't make me happy. They turned off the lights to sing happy birthday to another guest, which I thought was not needed. It also took forever to get our check. Very unsatisfied as I was told this place was awesome by a friend."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was appalling! Probably recommend skipping due to this - staff instead congregated outside sitting down as if they were deflated. Decor could also be improved. Please learn from this constructive feedback."}
{"text":"no question about it. this is the best pizza in vegas! they also have a great variety on the menu. everything from hummas plates to chicken wings, burgers and more.  we also had the italian chopped salad, my girl loved it. i think they make the ranch dressing  in house, it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and i loved it .. down the street from home and just got the time to come try it... so far ill recommend it."}
{"text":"Literally downloaded Yelp just write this one review. I ordered for delivery and waited nearly 2 hours before calling the shop. Afted 14 triple checks of my phone number and credit card they could only confirm that they didn't take my order. Unfortunately, the pizza actually did arrive, at a piping room temp, I was honeslty sick after the first slice."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to admit it I order from them once a week....   The crust is thin but has a nice bite to it and the sauce is fresh and perfectly seasoned not too sweet and not too tangy.  The toppings are fresh and the sides are great. It's in my top 3 best pizzas in Vegas"}
{"text":"My personal favorite pizza in the entire city. Do yourself a favor and get a pepperoni pizza (out of this world!) and an Italian hoagie double baked in the oven.

My family has been coming here for as long as I can remember and I have many good memories of this place! I will continue to come here and bring my children here as Napoli Pizzeria is a Pittsburgh institution. 

I would recommend this place to any of yinz out there! Support pizza shops like Napoli who actually take pride the food they serve!"}
{"text":"to whom it may concerned.. first of all thank you to the lady with the blond hair \"ana\" she offer us amazing service great food, in my opinion the best pizza in las vegas. excellent food great amazing taste. but the only bad thing this place has is the service they are rude dont smile no interest in what we want or need . our waitress  sucked ass, sorry for my words. we waited at least 15 min before some one help us. the only person working and doing her job was this short lady with blond hairby the name of ana she is the only one doing her job(good job ana). she is very nice and helpful, she was not even our waitress but she help us more than anybody in the restuarant did. i still love this place because the food. if u guys would get rid of the waitresses there \"\"\"besides\"\" the lady with the blonde hair (ana) because she is very nice and she always treats us good... this place would be more than amazing. food is amazingly perfect but the staff service (waitresses ) with black hair they don't belong there they made me feel unwelcome and this is not the  first time. but anyways hope u can fix this problem  because u might end up loosing a lot of clientele because of the rude bad unwelcome service giving by this ladies, besides that thank you napoli pizza and thank you ana. for doing a great job."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town to eat pizza as well as chicken wings has no rival to the food they have in their menu"}
{"text":"I ordered just a regular cheese pie with pepperoni, curly fries and zeppoles. I had to wait over an hour for such a small order and the delivery driver couldn't even make it to my door. I had to meet him at my gate which isn't close to my house at all. When I finally received my food it was cold and tasteless. The zeppoles aren't even zeppoles, they were like pancake balls that were set to the side too long. They were extremely chewy and stale! The curly fries weren't even curly anymore, seriously cold and soggy. I don't even want to describe my pizza, the majority of people know once a pizza gets cold the cheese is disgusting and it's like eating a piece of cardboard. 
When I asked for a refund the manager refused and said they delivered on time. The customer service was horrible and I even spoke to the manager and general manager Aleks and Victor and they were both bad at their jobs. Victor even told me that \"if the food is edible then I should just keep it.\" 
Never again will I order from here or any of my friends and family. 
This review was completely honest and will be posted on every site just so everyone can know, with the prices it's definitely not worth it. 

I do recommend Verrazano's, great pizza nice and thin with a great amount of cheese!
I also recommend not ordering from Eat24 as well because their customer service is horrible.. they always choose the restaraunt sides. Don't waste your time. Use Postmates, Grubhub or any other delivery app besides Eat24. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Vegas Napolis is definitely a stop. They support large parties and are very hospitable. The food is also AMAZING! And the kids live the 30' pizzas. Garlic parmesian wings and knots fabulous as well. Love love love Napolis! They really enjoyed Hojasrascas cookies from Del Rio, TX Chapas bakery...we had a really good time celebrating my Moms 60th, my 40th, lil sis 33rd, and oldet sis 42nd bday! Custom cupcakes from Freed's Bakery...turned then around in 36hrs..excellent service!"}
{"text":"This was so great! Loved the wings! They were very juicy and flavorful..i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hot wing where good and a little pricey a dollar French frys awesome.  delivery could  have been a little bit faster"}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizza place in Vegas. The workers are so amazing. They're always so welcoming and they have fun with it! Amazing service and know how to get stuff done. You can eat there, pick up, or have it delivered! I come here a lot since it's across the street from my work. It's in the parking lot on Sahara and Decatur next to Dotty's! They have an awesome set up inside. I love how spacious it is and how you're not super cramped in there. It's nice and bright in there so it puts you in a good mood just walking in. They have a wide selection of food. You can get anything from a cheese steak (chicken and beef), ham and cheese sandwiches, fried calamari sticks, salads, soup, meatball subs, burgers, wings, and even pasta. And obviously pizza!! THEY HAVE A GLUTEN FREE MENU AS WELL. As if they didn't have enough options. It's so cool to me! Also a kids menu. 

For me, a pizza isn't good unless you can pick it up and it sags over. You get that here. It's really delicious. It is greasy, but if you don't like greasy pizza, it's hard enough to trust you. I can't stand that deep dish thing people do. That's pie. Not a pizza. This is real pizza. Here if you pickup a one topping 16 inch pizza for only 8.99.. It's literally cheaper than getting a small. Might as well get a 16 inch!!! It's for all 3 locations as well. 

The desserts alone kill me every time. Nutella cheesecake, baklava, tiramisu, rice pudding, and more! I am always scared of trying baklava any where else because mother makes it best. It tasted just like my moms though and I was sooo happy!! Nutella or caramel cheesecake is straight up my favorite though. 

The burgers are too big to even fit in my mouth. You can pick from half a pound or a full pound. And it's real meat! Large selection of burgers. I finally tried it earlier today and I was so pleased with it. It comes with fries but you can substitute it for onion rings and more. The 1000 island burger is really delicious! 

Amazing food, amazing service, huge portions, great prices. I will always recommend this place and I respect the owner/workers here so much!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how they have a 3 star rating other than maybe delivery is bad or there is just your usual idiot \"anyone can rate \" opinion... I want you to know that I am a pizza guru and this is my new go to place in LV for the best pizza!!! Usually come once a week and the hours are incredible..... Love you guys and will be back at least once a week"}
{"text":"I've been going to Napoli's for years now since I work right next door. 
Great Staff! They know exactly what I want as soon as I step into their place.
They have one of the best white pizzas in town! Very convenient and the food is great!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner experience here. The prices were fair and there were plenty of options!

We decided to share 2 different plates so we went with the lasagna with meat and mushroom sauce (meat sauce) and traditional spaghetti with tomatoe sauce.

Both entreés were absolutely delicious. The waiter even asked if we wanted to add parmesan to our meals and it was a nice addition. The plates were actually pretty large. Normally I wouldn't have been able to finish a plate but we were both very hungry so we ended up finishing the plates.

They also provided us with a couple super warm bread rolls and butter. We only split one roll because we figured we would have plenty of carbs for the actual meal.

The restaurant is located along the street with lots of restaurants to choose from but this was the best looking Italian restaurant on the street and we were very happy with our meals!"}
{"text":"I would say this is a \"must-try\" pizza place! At a glance, the restaurant looked empty, if not too spacious. Cheerful Latin music was playing, wasabi colored walls, and an awkward restroom way around the dining area with no signs to lead you there at the start. None of that really mattered once we got our food. The cashiers/ waitresses, were very friendly and helpful. We ordered wings in two different flavors; add $1 for French fries? Deal! The carry-out special pizza is also for Dine-In. Great! All fresh and delicious. Will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"From 2/26/15
So, being from NYC I know good pizza when I see it, smell it and taste it- Napoli's is definitely top notch. We ordered a large pie, a glass Chardonnay for me, and the boyfriend got a Baltika beer. Their service is speedy and courteous. The pizza is tasty, with good flavors. Needless to say, this pizza place made this NY girl happy"}
{"text":"Normally I love Napoli's Pizza. For the Mayweather McGregor fight I ordered a $40 30 in Pizza to be delivered to the Iron Crossmen's Clubhouse. I specifically and politely requested extra sauce, well done and lots of extra parmesan and cheese. I was told it would be an hour and a half for the delivery and they were right on time and I understood. When the pizza arrives it looks like it had been prepared by my grandkids. The crust was white and doughy, there was almost no sauce on it, it appears that the driver put it on his passenger seat and two-thirds of the pizza had slid to one side of the box. And I receive the cursory three or four packets each of cheese and peppers. Even the guys at the club house couldn't believe how bad this pizza was. I went in Sunday morning to see if I could resolve this and nobody cared."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. These guys are really great, nice people with awesome pizza. Try a cut of plain or spinach with their ranch dressing. You should draft your will first bc you might die and go to heaven. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I went back tonight, it has been a while before. I had my favorite pizza a \"quattro stagioni\" and it was even better than I remember. Actually close to those I had in Italy!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible and don't let the name fool you these guys serve almost every delicious thing you can think of. I like the fact they have affordable lunch specials that are made there not like processed and freezed then reheated fast food. They have 24 different lunch choices all under $10. Check this place out it is totally worth it. Also friendly attentive customer service with an original and great looking dinning area."}
{"text":"Very good pie. Thinnish crust, nicely done. Pretty traditional local pizza joint done right. Great pepperoni."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me this long to try this place - they are close to my house, deliver, have way more options than a big-chain place, and the food was very tasty! 

We ordered the Napoli Special pizza (pepperoni, bacon, feta, and black olives - nothin' wrong with that list), and a steak salad (our attempt to justify getting a giant pizza for dinner). Steak salad was good - nothing really stood out that would make me HAVE to have it again, but there wasn't anything to complain about. The pizza was delicious though! The crust was just the right amount of crisp, chew, grease, and flavor :-) I will definitely order again to try out all the other fun pizza on the menu (I'm lookin' at you Taco pizza).

Be warned - you might vastly overestimate how much pizza 24\" is like me and have pizza in the fridge for daaaaays. Good news is it keeps well!"}
{"text":"the pizza was ok. the crust and sauce were good. the toppings were pretty good except the suasage. I dont know why they skimp on quality of this. It was the typical dominos processed pellets instead of real italian sausage. I do enjoy that they are open until 5 a.m. and deliver. This will come in handy when in vegas and needing pizza late night like I have wanted in the past. The other thing I enjoyed was the great 80's music they had piped into the restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza didn't have enough sauce tasted OK until when I bit into half of my pizza. I pulled out a black hair that was stuck in the cheese on my pizza. Gross"}
{"text":"This place got my order wrong. I ordered boneless wings and received boned wings. The delivery took over an hour, and over the expected delivery time. They wanted to send a driver to my house, pick up the boned wings because they needed proof, then once back to the store, they would make my correct order and have me wait for a new delivery. Ridiculous right?

I looked at their menu and saw there was only a $1 difference so I instead asked for a $1 refund, the difference between what I paid for and what I received. This is what they said: they offered to send a drive to my house to pick up the wrong order, and then they would refund me $1. That's right, they would take the food back and instead of offering me a full refund on the wings, they offered me $1. 

What a joke, I swear. Never again. Theft, place and simple."}
{"text":"Certainement l'une de mes pires soirées dans un restaurant. Non pas que la nourriture était mauvaise. Bien que je n'ai pas non plus le souvenir qu'elle était exceptionnelle. Mais disons que la façon dont nous avons été traités ce soir là, mes amis et moi, a gâché tout le reste!
Déjà, il y a clairement trop de tables dans ce restaurant, si bien qu'on s'y sent très rapidement oppressé. Nous, nous avons eu la « chance » de nous retrouver à une table dans le passage entre la salle et les cuisines. Nous étions donc tranquilles dans notre coin. Du moins, entre deux passages de serveurs...
Serveur dont l'amabilité ne nous a pas particulièrement frappés d'ailleurs. Non plus que son professionnalisme. Il ne nous a pas décroché un seul sourire de toute la soirée, n'a jamais rempli nos verres d'eau et s'est montré tellement agacé lorsque nous avons hésité sur nos commandes (le menu est très varié, reconnaissons leur au moins ça...) que nous n'avons pas osé lui demander de l'huile piquante ni du parmesan. Il aussi trouvé le moyen de se tromper sur notre commande : trois plats sur quatre ont dût être ramenés en cuisine!
Malgré cela, nous avons tout de même donné un pourboire de 10% car après tout, ce garçon passait peut-être une mauvaise soirée... Peut-être que d'habitude il était plus prévenant, plus souriant, etc. Bref, nous lui avons laissé le bénéfice du doute. Et là le patron est arrivé comme un cheveu sur la soupe, en nous a faisant remarquer bien fort que nous n'avions même pas laissé les 15% de pourboire attendus!!! Ce à quoi mon ami a simplement répondu : « mauvais service, mauvais pourboire! ».
Cette expérience était peut-être un ensemble de mauvais hasards mais toujours est-il que pour nous, le Napoli Pizzeria c'est fini!"}
{"text":"As my friend and I strolled down the street to look for restaurants, we stumbled upon Napoli Pizzeria and got lured in by the festive and joyous musical instruments and lively customers. Plus, I happened to be craving Italian food, especially pasta, so we decided to walk in and eat dinner here. 

The menu was simple since of the the dishes were pizza and pastas but there were still many different toppings and sauces making it difficult to choose. At last, I just kept it simple and ordered a pasta with meat sauce -that just can't go wrong! In fact, I had an absolutely enjoyable meal! The pasta was delicious and hit the spot, right on! The pasta was not too hard or soft, and the sauce was generous with lots of shredded beef. The sangria was refreshing, but I wished it was a tad stronger.

The server was friendly and came often to check on us. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place has decent pizza with a good price. We came to do pick up on the special pizza with one topping for $8.99. If you check in on yelp, you also get an order of garlic knots for free! The pizza was 16\" and personally, it was just too oily for me. When we ordered, they told us it will be ready in 25 mins. We were sitting there waiting, but 30 mins passed, they still didn't call for us. After another 5 mins., we had to go up to ask them in order to get our order. This is definitely not the best pizza place to go to but if you want cheap, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"So far everything I have ordered has been great with the exception of the appetizer combo. It was sooooo salty and everything tasted exactly the same. Usually I don't say anything but I am more disappointed because everything else was so good I got the Napoli Burger with Swiss cheese and it was amazing I could not put it down. The Napoli pastrami... omg! Their fries are excellent as is their shrimp salad, so I guess I'm wondering why you would serve pre-made Frozen tasteless appetizers when everything else is so delicious."}
{"text":"The Antipasta salad the best freshness and the Garlic knots were the best tasting and reasonable for the price. Fast service."}
{"text":"pizza an wings so good well worth the money yes takes a while to get a order but this is a pretty busy.... The staff is very friendly... will definitely come here again ... seriously on of my favorite spots in town"}
{"text":"I was here about a month ago. I loved the service and food. Last night I called my colleagues to have a dinner-meeting here. We start eating the pizzas and salads. Everything was so delicious that we forgot about meeting. This is our new favorite place. And thank you for great service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great people!! If you speak English, Spanish, Russian, or Romanian they got you covered. The people are amazing and very nice to help with your order over the phone. $8.99 for a pizza pick up and Free stuff for checking in is Super awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love Napoli's. Just recently learned about the steak hoagies. The sausage pizza is on point, and they got Turners lol"}
{"text":"Simply the best Pizza in town ! Excellent flavor and crust, friendly stuff and fast delivery ! Thank you ! We really enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have gone here for lunch a couple of times. The servers are friendly. The lunch specials are a good deal specially the two large pepperoni slices with a drink for $5.99."}
{"text":"Great food number 1 pizza in town, friendly staff and incredible service; fast delivery and the cheese bread is to die for.  Thank you Napoli Pizzeria"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Napoli for years, but my last 2 pizzas were both underdone - very doughy crust, underdone. We got onion and hot peppers on the pizza, and they were mostly uncooked. Something has changed, and we just got our last pizza here."}
{"text":"I love the 30 inch Napolis special pizza. It is so huge and delicious. The service is great. I definitely recommend this pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"The guy on the phone was a total douche and said they would not deliver to me because I was  \"too far away\". I live 1.6 miles from the establishments. When you say delivery do you mean just the distance we can walk without having to work too hard. Not a great way to run a customer service oriented business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Recommended by Melissa Gonzalez. Shout out to MG!! Service amazing! Salad & burgs, hot wings, & pizza da Bomb!!"}
{"text":"Great food but I should never have to wait over 2 hours for a BURGER. After calling the restaurant twice for an update and being told it would arrive in 5 minutes each time, I'm STILL waiting after that call and it had been an additional 40 minutes. HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"The food here is quite scrumptious.  I'm addicted to the wings and pizza here.  They have the \"BEST\" pizza in town and don't forget to get a side of their homemade ranch."}
{"text":"These guys are great.  The pizza is good and the service is fantastic.  Mineo's and Aiello's are awesome, but Napoli's does the one thing the other two don't - they deliver.   That's been the winning combo many times, and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Ordered lemon pepper wings. Didn't taste lemon or pepper, they had some sort of white sauce on them. Was told an hour, took over an our and a half."}
{"text":"I was so impressed on the taste and the size of their pizza. Being an Italian from Las Vegas, I know what is good not good pizza around the city and Napoli's 30 inch pizza was wonderful. Great price and a great pizza. I have already recommended this place to my friends and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The staff are always hella friendly and I like that you're able to order online to pick up (as well as for delivery). I've tried a ton of things here and their wings are always amazing, especially for the lunch special price. Pizza is great, too. While the wait can be a bit, especially since they can get pretty busy, like I said they have an option to order online in advance to skip all of that."}
{"text":"Average pizza.  Sauce and cheese lacks flavor. Dough was crusty and pepperoni was nicely charred.  Not bad-just no wow factor!"}
{"text":"Placed my order at 10:30 for a 11:45 am delivery.  20 mins late and ice cold pizza. Not even close to being warm.   Last time I will order from this place.   I guess they just don't care how their product leaves there restaurant.      Do not recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this review a 2 Star is based on past experience. Co-workers and I order here all the time because the pizza is great and they have a 30\" pizza that is big enough for all of us. This time it was just two of use and we ordered a 16\" meat lovers. We placed the order for delivery as usual. They quoted us 40mins - 1hr. As a former restaurant manager I know only take 20-25 mins to make a pizza from start to finish. We didn't receive the pizza for 90mins (problem #1). We were anxious to dig in and enjoy what we have come to love. Yet the pizza was cold. Not like lukewarm cold, like the cheese is solid cold. (Problem #2). As we were eating my co-work bit into this hard piece of something (no it was not cartilage) it was an odd piece of plastic, maybe a utensil broke or something idk. (Problem #3) we called to inform them and this rude lady responded as \"well if you want a refund or a credit we need to pick up the pizza\" when the driver drive back to get the pizza he was just as puzzled as we were but what was really odd was that he needed to call the manager (the rude lady) to tell her how many slices were left in order to process the refund?? Gurl plz I ain't lying. You eat that pizza and tell me if there was anything else. Then when your done with it, hope on back to the kitchen and send me a fresh one like you should have in the first place.... I'll think twice about recommending the place to my guest again. Btw I work for a hotel so I have many people that ask for pizza."}
{"text":"Was in vegas for vacation.  My friends and I ordered napolis at our room. Was soggy and ok. Nothing great.  Just ok"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. Staffs are friendly and they got my order correct when they seemed to be very busy. I ordered a 30 inch pizza and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this pizza joint and let me tell you it met all my expectations and more ! The staff was super friendly, the atmosphere was great, and the food is out of this world ! This place is defiantly a must try."}
{"text":"I have been sick for days and desperate for some yummy pizza. Napoli claims this is where pizza was invented. Pizza from Napoli is thin with a this crust. Mine was a typical NY style pizza - thick outer crust, and a soggy thin crust. The fresh basil was a plus, but overall the pizza was ok. The Tiramasu was delicious and the cannoli was good too.  If I was in a pizza craving bind I may order from here again but would kindly ask them so to make sure the crust was thin, like they serve in Napoli."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in Vegas last fall, and we needed a night off the strip.  We were craving pizza after eating lots of fancy food, and we found this place on yelp. 

The pizza was delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  However, I still have dreams about the garlic balls.  For $3, you get 20 delicious little balls of dough. They are yummy when you get them. But I highly suggest you save some and eat them warmed up the next day.  They are super soft and soaked in butter and garlic and so delicious as leftovers."}
{"text":"Just placed a delivery order and I feel compelled to write this even before my pizza arrives. Whoever they have working the delivery phone line is a rude twat. If I wasn't hungry there's no way I would give this establishment my money but alas here I am. Smh. I would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Napolis is hand down my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas, it is the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and the crust is perfect. I always order delivery I would say an hour is the average time it gets delivered. The wings here are so big and have so much meat! I always get hot,but he warned hot is reallly hot which is prefect for me. The ranch they make in house is pretty good too. So I came into eat  with a big group of friends and we ordered the 24 inch pizza with pepperoni and 40 wings with hot,mild,Hawaiian, and garlic Parmesan. All of the wings were pretty good I wasn't a big fan of the Hawaiian and the garlic Parmesan are super creamy. We came we conquered and we destroyed! I tell everybody about this place! I will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Food was good was upset apparently they raised prices without letting anyone know . And on the flyer it's still the old prices I'm talking on a ten dollar difference on wings ... The guy on be phone didn't really care that wasn't right !!! Not a good experience !! 

Must say I just updated my review this time I ordered wings and got free garlic balls can I tell you well worth the money on the wings food was amazing !!!!! I guess alway give a business another chance !! - not happy still with the big increase on prices but food was amazing !!"}
{"text":"As someone who spent the last four years living in NYC, I'm very familiar with \"New York style\" pizza. In fact, I lived above Rosario's on the Lower East Side, where I'd grab a *perfect* pepperoni slice four times a week. So naturally I was excited to read about Napoli.

Expecting to be wowed, I dialed in a delivery order for an 18\" pie with pepperoni and onions for about $18. When it arrived an hour later, the results were immediately disappointing. 

First of all, let's make something clear. \"New York style\" pizza is not rocket science. It's defining quality is simplicity--a thin, floppy slice with fresh tomato sauce. When it's really good, there's a pool of grease on the surface that rolls down your arm. Shake some pepper flakes and powdered garlic on it and you're done. It should never be crispy, \"doughy\" or covered with pretentious crap. Anything beyond pepperoni is pushing it. 

This pizza, on the other hand, was bready and sweet. The cheese formed a film which slid off in your mouth. I didn't find the ingredients especially flavorful, fresh or abundant. Adding insult to injury, there was a $3.50 delivery charge and the driver gave me lip for going \"out of his way.\" In sum, it was typical suburban pizza, marginally better than the major chains but thoroughly pedestrian. 

Now, I'll concede that the debate on what constitutes a true \"New York style\" pizza will undoubtedly continue raging for centuries. But here's two things to consider: 1) Not all pizza in New York is good. 2) Not all New Yorkers have good taste. In fact, many are perfectly happy with Sbarro and Domino's. I am not one of them. Indeed, I feel a certain responsibility to defend the \"New York\" monicker from those who would profit from its misuse. If my critique of Napoli seems harsh, I beg you to keep this in mind."}
{"text":"I only happened upon this place because they left a delivery menu on my door. Since that first time I ordered, I am ADDICTED. I have never eaten their pizza so I can't testify to that, but their Italian food is sososo yummy. I think I've tried everything on the Baked Pasta & Specials part of the menu. My fave is the baked ravioli. Sometimes I can't make up my mind and I'll get Whole Lotta Pasta which is incredible. Oh. . .and get the garlic balls! God, they are good. I order from Napoli probably once every 3 weeks for delivery to my apartment. Never had a problem with my order and the food is so good. You won't be sorry. Hey. . .anybody ever try the ribs?  By the way, for the New Yorker out there? Get over yourself. You all didn't invent pizza and if you miss the NY variety  so bad, go home."}
{"text":"I never do reviews but I have to on this. Food is ok. their customer service is horrible. Two times me and wife have bought over 80 bucks worth of food they lose the order. One manager gives you a credit then the next manager takes it away. Horrible unhappy people I warn you take your money else where"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with amazingly large sizes! If your pizza tastes bad its because you chose a bad combination of toppings. Their Italian Pizza is my favorite.

They have the best music taste EVAR! (can you say 24/7 Michael Jackson, EPIC 90's techno pop, Jock Jams, and retro progressive house?)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Italian joint. My family and I come here a minimum of twice every month & have never once been disappointed. The staff is always extremely welcoming, especially the male waiter, he is extremely friendly! We always order the same exact thing: Pizza, Wings, Fries, & Garlic Balls (like garlic knots). The pizza has a phenomenal taste, their homemade sauce is outstanding. It's very difficult to describe the greatness of this restaurant through a review, so I highly recommend to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love Napoli! I always go for the hot buffalo chicken fingers. The spice is just right for me! Trust me, it is pretty hot nowadays. The pizza is delicious as well. Nice and greasy. I think a pizza without grease uses fake cheese, so this place is legit, haha. I am not a huge fan of many other things on the menu, but my go-to dishes are always great!"}
{"text":"I love there pizza and especially the wings. I always order medium wings well done with fries. I have never been disappointed. Had the garlic knots delicious when they are freshly made. My boyfriend always gets mild and garlic parm wings.. I go to both locations. I have also had delivery, always hot n ready to be eaten."}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff they always remember your name and make you feel welcome each time you come in great food"}
{"text":"I was recently in town visiting a friend and he took us to Napoli. We started off with their garlic knots which were to die for. Then we had their giant 30 inch pizza and wings, and they were delicious!! Beer selection was great too. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great greasy pizza...love the food. But the past few times I have ordered I seem to get the same guy who takes it. Sounds Hispanic....dumb as a post....this guy asks the same questions over and over even if you have given him the answer. Holy shit is this guy stupid. And no....he is not just confirming....it seems as if he is busy doing multitasking and completely messing it up.....good god....I just want my freaking pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was open late and the menu was available after midnight. However service was not good at all. Our party of five waited 40-50 minutes for our food. I have a feeling our server forgot to put our food in because when it did finally come out, it was appetizers and entrees all together. It tasted good and at least we knew it was fresh but that could have also been due to our long wait and growing hunger. Our server, an older man, was just generally brusque which comes off as rude. 

While we were waiting for our food, we noticed that there was a dead lobster and a sick looking one in their lobster tank. So I definitely wouldn't recommend getting the lobster..."}

The wheat flour extract used to coat the fries may help them stay crispy and warmer longer---- but if you have diarrhea the next day--- it is likely an allergic reaction to these coated fries."}
{"text":"Napoli tries to put itself into the famous Pittsburgh pizza competition against Aiello's and Mineo's, but it falls short, save one standard: it looks damn good. In the end, however, it will always place as shameful, shameful bronze. Here's what is best about Napoli: its cheese, which tastes exactly the same as the other two (same cheese seller?), and the crust is chewy, too. But the sauce is rather flavorless, though a little sweet.

Don't get me wrong. This excellent pizza, and it destroys 95% of all other pizza in the universe. But in Pittsburgh, it only wins the consolation match."}
{"text":"Welcomed in by this latina lady with a nice husky voice. This place holds 50 people max capacity due to the sign being so far up by the ceiling to see lol. I checked in on yelp and boy did they offer free garlic balls! Between the three of us it was around ~$50 : shrimp Alfredo, chicken wings with fries, a cheese burger with fries, ice tea and red wine. A friendly upsell with dessert was turned down with us not even finishing our orders. Nice place to watch soccer or whatever sports channel youre into. Also the dancy music in the background makes the atmosphere very lively even though it was dead with us being the only guests during the end of our lunch meal."}
{"text":"First I used to order here a lot and today I get my order and it didn't come to my house for more then 1hour and 30 minutes. And my food came in cold., fries hard and my pizza I ordered was cold. Talk to the person over the phone and they didn't do anything."}
{"text":"Veggie pizza and chicken wings were to die for! I ordered from them because they were one of very few open late. Pricey but I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food, the restaurant itself is nice, the service is fast and the food is great. I ordered the Penne Moscovitch and I 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"After the horrible service I had received a couple years back, I stopped frequenting the restaurant. It had been a while since I had visited and when I returned the shop had been completely remodeled and new staff had been added. Though I have a hard time moving passed the poor service and the lack of management's concern about said service, this is still one of my favorite pizza places ever. I don't think I'll ever be a frequent flyer again, but I will indulge occasionally."}
{"text":"This was not at good. I didn't like the pastrami it was on scraps of meat. I called them to complain but they did nothing about it. The reuben was okay you could tell what you were eating. In all I will never order that sandwich again."}
{"text":"Napoli's is def one of the best pizza spots in Vegas! 
Besides the pizza being amazing, the wings and chicken fingers are really good too! 

As for the pasta I wouldn't vouch for it. My sister tried the fettuccini Alfredo, and I felt it was flavorless. The chicken that goes with the pasta is just as flavorless and has an odd look to it. It's clearly frozen and looks like it was put in the microwave to defrost than thrown on the pasta. Def didn't like it, but not every restaurant can perfect every entree. 

Now, lets discuss pizza! Their Southwestern Chicken Pizza is hands down my favorite! Its like having nachos but on a pizza! I know the nachos vision on pizza doesn't sound great but I can assure you, it's great! It has so much flavor to it - guaranteed to fall in love with every flavorful bite! Their pizza comes with a nice, thick, crunchy crust which makes the bite 10x more enjoyable! If a pizza with a lot of toppings is this great, I'm sure any other pizza they offer is just as good! 

The wings and chicken fingers are really good here! On the wings if you request them crunchy/extra cooking they'll have a real good crunch to them! Not many places are willing to cook a chicken wing for an extra minute, but Napolis doesn't mind it.
They're all about the customer experience, or so it seems! I have yet to have a bad experience with the restaurant. 

If you're someone that enjoys spicy food be sure to try their \"Hot\" flavored chicken fingers! They're dipping in a buffalo sauce with chili peppers, super spicy! I def can't handle all that heat but I still have one just to satisfy the spicy craving. 

Hope everyone has a satisfying experience as I've had every time I order from Napolis."}
{"text":"VERY DISSAPOINTED AND UPSET !!! I WAS A LOYAL CUSTOMER UNTILTODAY! We ordered 2 large pizza's, cheese and pepperoni. It took them 2 hours to deliver, and when they delivered they informed us that they had made a mistake! They brought only the cheese pizza and 2 slices of pepperoni in a separate box. 2 slices of pizza! Can you imagine that? They are very unprofessional and rude!!! The driver informed us that the pepperoni pizza will be arriving in 10 min, the driver was on his way. We waited ANOTHER 30 MINUTES!! and the pizza still hadn't arrived. We called the pizzeria and spoke with the manager, and they were VERY RUDE! They did not care about the issue, they did not want to refund us our money, and they told us that the driver wasn't even on his way here and that it will still take another hour for the second pizza to arrive. HORRIBLE!!! NEVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN! Also, the dough on the pizza tasted old! Everything was just HORRIBLE! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM EVER!!!!!!!!! VERY RUDE! 

30 minutes after the delivery driver came to our location and gave us $15 dollars back! no pizza no nothing!!!! Very rude, he threw the money at me ! what kind of customer service is that 

the incapable managers : Flor and Victor !!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza fast and friendly service love this place reccomend it to all.... The dough is just amazing and the garlic balls are just right not to over done and as i said the staff and facilities are amazingly clean. The fountain drink dispenser is amazing the variety of drink options is astounding.. Definitely take my hat off to napolis las vegas"}
{"text":"I had some major issues with the Henderson store when I lived on the east side of town.  However, living on the west side, I've decided to give them a try and I'm glad I did.  I like their pizza.  Is it the best?  No.  But it is very good pizza.  And their 16\" one-topping carryout specials for $8.99 are a good deal.  The people at this location are very nice as well.  If you need a lot of pizza for a good price, this is definitely a place you should try.  Not to mention, their delivery zones seem very vast as far as restaurants go."}
{"text":"I used to love this pizza. I honestly thought it was the best pizza in the city. Every time I thought about it, my mouth would salivate. I'm really happy that you guys are doing well, and have expanded, (or sold your company) so much, but the quality of your pizza went down. Way down. I don't know what you're doing differently, but it's awful. I got a pizza last night, and it's going to be the very last time. It doesn't taste the way it used to. At all. I don't know what it is, but it was horrible. If it tasted like this from the beginning, you probably wouldn't have expanded as much as you have. You should really consider going back to the way you used to make pizzas. Or go back to the ingredients that you used to use. I don't know, I just know that it tastes absolutely nothing like the way it did a few months ago. It's not just me that feels this way. My dad used to get your giant pizza every couple weeks, and since you guys changed something, he hasn't gone back. I thought he was just being crazy, but now I know that he wasn't. It's truly not tasty anymore."}
{"text":"Solid, high quality ingredients and they deliver to my house which is 15 minutes away easy. They usually deliver right around one hour after I order, which is totally reasonable, and the price is pretty decent for the quality. 
I appreciate the little extra attention to details. They always include a baggie with paper plates, red pepper, parm, and napkins. Not really necessary, but nice. 
My only gripe, and it's a minor one, is that the pizza isn't as hot as I would like. Not cold, but not hot. Of course, this is probably because I live so far away. :P"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that my first review for Napoli's will not be a good one. I've dined here multiple times over the years and I've never had an issue. Unfortunately, things have changed. We ordered our food around 7:40. The expected delivery time was 8:39. That's still a considerably long time for delivery, but we like Napoli's. Furthermore, you would think that a delivery from Sahara and Decatur to Rainbow and Charleston wouldn't take long. Not the case here. Instead our food arrived at 9:22. The delivery guy tossed our pizza, and the box containing the chicken fingers with so much force it slid on the counter. The food was good as always but our pizza and chicken fingers were cold. I doubt I'll eat or order from this location again."}
{"text":"Do not come here in the morning! We just left, and we're given flat day old soda, flavorless undercooked wings, our vegetables seemed like they were also left out from the day before (they were soggy). It's not the first time this happens."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the pizza here. I went in today for lunch and had there lunch special $6.00 for a drink and all you can eat 30'' pizza by the slice(the slice was about the size of your head). Good pizza for the money."}
{"text":"As I continue to try all of the pizza places in Squirrel Hill, I finally tested out Napoli this week.  The staff was super nice when I walked in the door, and there were plenty of different slice toppings to choose from.

I ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of white with tomatoes and spinach ($4.39 w tax).  The cheese slice was quite good, with plenty of yummy cheese.  The crust was an average thickness, but this is not a floppy slice of pizza.  It was really easy to eat with my hands.  I didn't care for the white slice, as I like more garlic and found their to be too much oil.  That is a personal preference, though.

While they do deliver, the owners were saying that it is really hard to keep up with all the business they get.  But they do deliver beer, which probably is fairly popular.

All in all, a good slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Buyers Beware!!!  Do not order here!!!

If only I was able to give no stars, because this place does not deserve a single one. I called this place based on a suggestion of a very good friend of mine who said that they had great food. Unfortunately they were unable able to cater to my allergy so I had to order pizza elsewhere. I did order garlic balls and three Italian sodas. I called and put in my order to this location first prior to putting my pizza order in somewhere else.

 I was told that our order will arrive in 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour had passed I called back and spoke to the same woman I put my initial order with and she told me that it was not an hour yet it had only been 50 minutes, plus she argued with me!! I checked the phone and the call time on my cell phone and it had been an hour. She said that the driver had just left and would be here in a few minutes. When I told her that the pizza had arrived long before their driver had she told me that they were three times busier than everyone else and that was why. Why would you ever tell a client that?

 I got off the phone we waited ten more minutes the driver had still not arrived , so I called them again and asked for a manager. The manager, named Bob came on the phone I explained the situation very nicely without getting angry or loud and was trying to find out where are sodas and are garlic balls were because we had already received our pizza from the place we called after them. So the manager fight with me and argue with me and what time it was I told him that the time was 11:15 and had already been well over an hour since we ordered he insisted that the time was only 11:04 and it was only an hour since we put in our order. No I called your person an hour ago and talked to them and told them that the driver had not arrived yet. He told me that I was yelling at him, so I put him on speakerphone so my friends could hear the way that he spoke to me. You've got to be kidding me that you speak to clients like that. When I told him that their place had been suggested by a very good friend of mine he said he really didn't care. I asked him to cancel my order three times before he said he would and he said he would refund my money in 24 to 48 hours. He told me that he would cancel the driver.

I think the best part of the night was when 10 minutes after I got off the phone with the manager his staff member called me and asked me what flavor I wanted for the wings. When I sounded confused and said we actually just cancelled our order with you and I spoke to the manager she said oh so you actually have the same telephone number that's similar to the person that I was trying to reach. I don't think so lady I doubt that there are that many people in Vegas calling from an 805 number. 

Do not order from this place! Buyers Beware!"}

The Vegas Strip is only like, 8 blocks and the rest of the city works to support it. But there's really good food all around it. This place is one of the best Italian spots out here. The customer service is bomb. Check it out."}

{"text":"Service has gone downhill the last 2 months. My family orders from here once a week. We always order for pickup and the last 3 times they have forgotten to give us a complete order. Last week they forgot to give us ranch with the wings, the lady on the phone said it was there and accused us of being incorrect. Today we ordered 2 pizzas, 2 orders of fries, and half a bucket of wings. We got home and opened everything and noticed they forgot to add our wings. My wife called and they said no that our wings were in the bag. Back and forth they adamantly kept saying they gave it to us, we never ever complain even if the order is wrong by a little. We drove back and the lady at the counter basically threw the half bucket of wings at us and never bothered to apologize for the incorrect order. Needless to say, this will be the last time we ever order from there and I will never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Being more of an Italophile than a Francophile and given that I live in the North End Boston, my pizza standards are high. I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised.

The house red was good too, good enough for dins."}

{"text":"Today was my first personal experience with ordering food with them but not my first time eating their food. I ordered it for delivery. Ordered a small calzone(pictured & half eaten, it was double its size & to them is considered \"small\" portion.\" Also ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries, a philly cheesesteak & some curly cheese bacon fries. Having eaten their food before i was expecting goodness. Please note that i paid with card on yelp. I was 4 miles from them.. the order took about 50 mins. So delivery guy comes, my fiance answers & hes telling my fiance that he needs to pay cash. Im looking at the reciept that says $47.88. So he asks me what happened.. i double check to see if i messed up & my fiance looks at his card statement online to show proof of purchase & to our surprise we are charged THREE times. NONE of which were the amount on the reciept at the door. We expected the bill to be $1 more than yelp said due to sauce charge. We didn't know they would charge us 3 times then argue when his restaurant under charged me TWO CENTS. They charged me 3 times.. each bill was $46-$47 EACH. The delivery guy wanted to say that none of the amounts were right because the last charge was $47.86 (which was the highest charge) I was upset & said \"If you would like the 2 cents i willl gladly get it for you\" & he declined, asking for a signature. Needless to say BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

But on a lighter note :) my bacon cheeseburger was AMAZING! Not dry, or soggy like most i order! The curly bacon cheese fries were gross. They tasted stale and undercooked. The calzone was amazing! & huge. When i saw the pizza box, i thought he had the wrong order. & i was told the philly was really good! So work on the customer service a little & we'll return!"}
{"text":"This place was great.. Food was good and service was great. We had a party of 11. Enough room for all of us. We had pizza, wings, fries and the garlic knots, so don't forget to check in on your Yelp so you can some free garlic knots . The same night u was there I was already recommending this place to my family who were in town at Vegas as well. I would definitely come back again. I was happy and stuffed and so were my kids."}
{"text":"When you have a large group of people what could be a better dining choice than Italian?  For our first meal in Montreal this place was a good find.

This place had the feel of a family owned restaurant.  The Italian men walking around in that place just cracked me up, especially the elderly gentleman in the sunglasses.    

The atmosphere was cute and a little bit on the kitschy side.  They had a tree in the middle that had lit up grapes on them.  In addition, they had strolling musicians taking requests.  The service was good as well.  They did a good job splitting our checks which made it a good choice for our larger group. 

The food was good.  I had a bowl of minestrone and a pizza with green peppers and pepperoni.  The soup was slightly on the salty side, but it had a good amount of vegetables which is just what I was looking for.  The meat on the pizza was of very good quality and the cheese was good as well."}

{"text":"Je pense que je vais essayer de faire bref, mais il y a matière, ou pas...
Jeudi soir 18h30, la pizzeria habituelle, la \"Dei Campari\" avec ses pizzas au feu de bois, rue Saint-Denis, est pleine à craquer.
Pourquoi ne pas aller dans la pizzeria en face qui m'a toujours attiré l'il avec sa déco flashy...?
Accueil agréable par un serveur, avec son accent italien, qui a jeté sa cigarette pour nous.
Une fois l'effet étourdissant de la déco (voir les photos) passé, voyons voir la carte...
Une table d'hôte raisonnable, une soixantaine de sortes de pâtes et plus de quatre-vingt pizzas différentes... Rien d'exceptionnel, pas d'originalité et même pas de pâtes ou pizzas aux fromages...
Menu du soir (à deux) :
Une soupe minestrone, pas trop mal, mais les légumes paraissant frais sont trop cuits. Finalement, elle ne doit pas être si fraîche..
Une soupe aux oignons gratinée, bonne mais avec un MORCEAU de fromage par dessus.
Quelques morceaux de pains réchauffés avec quelques godets de beurre qui est devenu complètement liquide à cause de la chaleur des pains (combien de fois ont-ils fondu ?)
Une pizza, probablement une base préparée il y a quelques jours, garnie et réchauffée juste pour nous...
Une part de lasagne à la viande et vu la couleur blanchâtre de cette dernière, ça ne devait pas être du buf, avec une sauce tomate, le tout jeté dans une assiette. Petite portion, mais désolé, je n'ai pas pu finir... C'était vraiment pas à mon goût, plutôt celui d'un vieux frigo.
Deux ex(s)presso et la facture...
Avec deux liqueurs, un total 62 $ avec les TIPS.
Le service à été rapide, les serveurs souriant, sauf une fois où le monsieur est venu la bouche pleine (difficile de sourire dans ce cas là).
Il n'y avait pas foule, mais on aurait mieux fait d'attendre un petit quart d'heure, qu'une table se libère, dans le restaurant d'en face...
Petit bilan et pas des moindres, sans s'être fait péter la panse, douleurs abdos et nausées pour ce soir... Léger doute sur la fraîcheur...
Les propriétaires en font de trop (déco, nombre de plats, etc...), cela manque de finesse et de qualité.
A éviter (désolé)."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere that offered delivery late night in Spring Valley. After looking at the most reviews for a few places we decided to try Napoli. We've ordered delivery from this place twice so far and have picked up carryout a few times afterwards.

The first time we ordered delivery we got the 18\" large Supreme pizza. The pizza was huge. The toppings were generous. The crust was the right mix of chewy and crispy. The next time we ordered we ended up getting a smaller size pizza and a combo platter. The combo platter comes with mozzarella sticks, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings. The pizza was consistent to the good quality of the first time we ordered. The combo platter was hot when it arrived. Everything was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the zucchini sticks. 

This restaurant is great. It has become our new regular pizza spot."}

When the OWNER heard our address (exactly 2 miles from the shop) he hung up on my husband before we told him we would pick it up if it was too far.

I ordered 1 large sausage pizza 6 wings & a 2 liter bottle of soda total was $21.00 and some change.
My husband brought the food home & we were given 4 wings & dried wilted veggies 2 pieces of celery & 2 pieces of carrots the carrots were blackened at the tips & very dried. Clearly these veggies were old! 
4 wings for $6.99??? We were ripped off this isn't fair!!
I called & spoke to 2 different managers who argued with me & made me out to be a liar saying that the camera showed I was given 6 wings & fresh veggies....
All I was offered was a $2.00 refund or to have 2 wings & fresh veggies delivered to me. 
Really??? So I have to wait delivery for 2 pieces of chicken while my pizza gets cold??? This is unfair!!
Very sad my family will not be returning back here ever again because we were ripped off & called liars!!!
Unacceptable"}
{"text":"A friend and I ordered takeout from Napoli this evening around 6pm.  My friend lives right around the corner on Beacon St. and is a frequent customer of Napoli.  Given that I'd tried competitors Aiello's and Mineo's, I was curious to try this unsung hero of the SqHill pizza wars to see how it stacks up.

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza with a side of ranch dressing plus two bottles of Red Ribbon soda, which came to $22.50.  Upon trying the pizza, I'd rate it above Mineo's and equal to or slightly below Aiello's in terms of quality.  It had a medium weight crust that was neither super thick or paper thin and was crispy (I'm a sucker for a crispy crust).  The sauce was bolder and more flavorful than Mineo's, and was generously portioned.  There was also a decent amount of cheese, and the pepperonis were curled up, containing miniature pools of grease (grease averse pizza eaters beware).  One slight annoyance was the tendency of the toppings to slide off of the pizza--every slice I took had this issue.  The ranch dressing was alright but nothing particularly special; however, it made for a nice accompaniment to the crust.

When my friend called in our order, it took about 20 min. to prepare, so be sure to allow ample time if you're picking up.  Seating is quite limited--it's clear that they do most of their business via take out and delivery.  Also, they only accept cash, so be sure to bring enough to pay for your order.  Overall, a decent pizza--not the best I've had in PGH, but not the worst, either."}

Two thumbs up guys) will come back"}
{"text":"Second time here; my first experience would have been...probably a 3.5 star, but I'm glad I came back to get a better picture.

It's around 730pm on a Monday night. My best friend wanted pizza and I wanted fries, so we go to dine-in at Napoli's. Their extensive menu is convenient as he can get his pizza fix and I can get my frenchy fry on.

Now here is where we go on a roller coaster ride...
Walking in: no greeting whatsoever. Lots of staring, no smiling. Both girls at the counter are on the phone. Seems standard enough.
Ordering: One girl at the counter was on the phone and although I can never be too sure, she did not look like she was taking an order at all. She was leaning back against the counter and just casually chatting into the phone. She looks at me and I smile at her, waiting patiently. She stares and keeps talking. A few moments pass, she's still on the phone, and I'm getting looks from the cooks in the back. Finally, she yells out for the other girl to come out and take my order while she resumes talking on the phone. I don't know who takes that long to order food from a restaurant but they really had this chick occupied. Finally, the other lady comes out and I put my order in.
Food/Service: The other lady is actually really nice, and she made our experience a lot better. She was friendly, talked and joked with us, which is nice since we didn't really feel like we were getting any attention at this place (did I mention we were the only patrons here?). We had ordered calamari, pasta (came with garlic bread and a side salad), a small supreme pizza, chicken alfredo, and curly cheese fries with bacon bits. Everything was good except the fries. Ready to quench my thirst for greasy, fried potato goodness, I stabbed my fork into the fries, only to find the combination of fries, cheese, and bacon had melded into a solid brick of lukewarm lard. I am beginning to get the idea that this basket has been sitting for a while, as it was also the last thing to come from the kitchen (when it should have been one of the first). Hmm. I take it back to the front, asking if I can return it. I didn't even want them to make another. Nice Lady says she'll have to ask her manager and tells me to give her a few moments. She comes back out to say her manager is busy and to give her about five minutes. I go back to sit down. 

By the time we were done with our meal, we still haven't heard from the manager. Best Friend tells me to forget about it. So we do. Consider it their tip.

Bottom line is, the food is mostly good, but the service is terrible. 90% of the time, the girls at the counter were on the phone. I'm pretty sure they were answering phone orders, but that one extremely rude girl was pretty much on the phone the ENTIRE TIME we were there, except to give us our pizza. Staff seemed to stare a lot...but that might be because we were the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Napoli's Pizza and I am so glad he did!!!The service was fantastic and the pizza and wings were delicious!!!I definitely recommend this pizza place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Might have to wait a bit but it's soooo worth it!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The employees don't care. Period. I called in an order and made sure to say I needed it as fast as possible, assuming it would be 45 minutes for a pizza and a salad, it's been an hour and a half, when I called in the guy on the phone said I told you on the phone it would take an hour, yet the driver hadn't even left the building yet and he hung up on me. At this point I don't even care if the food is the best food I've ever had, I'll never buy food here again and I'll make sure none of my family here does as well. They don't deserve business if they can't handle the customer service side of it.

So it's now been 2 hours that I've been waiting for my food, I called in and asked how much longer it would be and the guy said 10 minutes, this was 30 minutes ago.

Edit--
Adding in that the food was ALL cold, the pizza cheese was almost frozen, the curly fries were soggy as well as the salad. And to top it off they forgot my sons breadsticks which I clearly said twice and he confirmed on the phone and repeated back breadsticks to me.

Food ordered at 11:14pm
Food arrived at 1:37pm

Fast delivery is written on the box as well, false advertising much?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. Super cheap carry out specials that is sometimes worth the extra drive to this place. The pizza was great and the wings were even better but my last meal on earth would be a bucket of wings so some favoritism. 

If you like balls in your mouth, get the garlic balls. 

After getting any balls in your mouth you might want a mint or five. (I do not know from previous experience with other balls)"}
{"text":"I love plain cheese pizza. I love a crunchy yet soft crust, good melty cheese, and a not-too-sweet sauce. Napoli had all three, but where they fell short, which surprised me, was the taste of the crust, it was way too salty. I don't know if it was because it went bad or they didn't measure the salt correctly but I was very disappointed. I loved everything else about the pizza so I hope this was a one-time thing. I will give them another chance but I will buy a single slice next time instead of a whole pie."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Told me it's going to take about an hour and the delivery came 30 minutes right after I hang up the phone.  Great serving amount of food. Friendly, fast, and reasonable cost. One of the few I'll recommend..."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them one star is because I have to. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY PEPS AND ORDER FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE!!

This is the email I sent to them about my experience last night. After what I delt with when I called to complain this morning I doubt whom ever reads it will care so I am sharing it with ya'all as a head's up.

To whom it may concern:

We ordered a pizza, BLT and a side of fries and had it delivered to our room at the Rio last night at 9:30 PM.

Let me start with the ordering process...
After repeating myself over and over again to the not so pleasant women on the other end of the phone whom was have just as hard of a time understanding me as I was her I finally got our order in. (This process was enough to make me not want to order from here again.)

At 10:50 PM our order finally arrived. Your driver was polite to my surprise after what I delt with on the phone. I was however very uncomfortable with the fact that he made an imprint of my card and took it with him...

Awww finally now we get to eat...  Nope!! The pizza was burnt and tasted aweful the BLT was lettuce and A LOT of mayo with a little piece of tomato and a pice of burnt bacon. Now on to the fries completely soggy and they tast like pickles because for some reason someone thought putting pickles ontop of the fies was a good idea.

I spent $50 on a meal my family and I couldn't even eat.

After getting into it with your manager just now  whom evidently is also the same women I talked to last night. It is clear to me that you don't care about your customers and you go by the manager is always right because she has to come in and work at 9AM after working until 1 AM the night before motto."}
{"text":"Love this place I eat here at lease once or twice as week they even have my order on file. great deals for lunch!! Best wings and pizza ever i also love the buffalo chicken salad yum. Great place there always busy which tells you the good is great"}
{"text":"I literally LOVE napolis! I recommend it to anyone all their food is really great! Everything from the fries and sandwiches to pizza and salads. The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the bathrooms are disgusting!! Literally horrible if they would fix that, an easy 5 stars"}
{"text":"Bomb!!! My new favorite pizza spot!! It's a nice dinning room..pizza is delicious! Free garlic balls if you check in with a yelp check in and are so good! The servers were very polite. I'm from Los Angeles...I wish one would pop up over here!! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I purchased food from Napolies a few times and it was actually pretty good especially there pizzas. I ordered a pie a few weeks ago and it was really greasy but I know it can't be perfect everytime and I didn't even call to complain. I just ordered another Pizza and the bottom crust was burnt so I'm finished them , I'll just make my own in the future."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but RUDE. I ordered three slices of plain to go and they had an attitude for no reason. Being within the same block as two of their biggest competition, I found it a little shocking. The first display of rudeness happened when I ordered and I asked about the sign outside. It said they were hiring all positions, and asked if that included delivery drivers because I knew a guy friend who was looking to deliver food. When I asked, they rolled their eyes and made it clear they were not hiring drivers who were girls. I told them that I was not interested myself but actually inquiring for a friend but they kept joking sarcastically at my expense and made me feel really uncomfortable. It made the pizza eating experience afterward really unenjoyable and I will never return."}
{"text":"Okay so last night was my first time giving this place a Go.... and Wow wow wow!!!! I'm sorry to say but this Pizza was muchhhhh better than Aiellos anndddd Mineos(at least the Mt LEBO location) my fiancé and I are pizza  connoisseurs and wow did we love it! I ordered the White pizza and it was amazing! Perfect texture and Full of Flavor! Richie had the pepperoni and sausage and he LOVED it! Now for him to say he loves something especially pizza, means A WHOLE LOT!! .  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for my co workers around 145am. I made a few requests and they did all that was requested! (Pizza cut in squares, paper plates and condiments). The toppings on the pizza were black olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, pepperoni and sausage.

They delivered the pizza around 2:45am. Everything was perfect and my co workers said it was the best they've had. 

I'm not much of a pizza person but I really liked it here. 

When we have potlucks at work this will be our go to spot."}
{"text":"After reading alot of reviews I decided to give this place a chance. Big mistake. Most reviews are correct. Horrible customer service and food isn't that great. 


Nice delivery driver tho. Even if he forgot half my order and had half his family in his car when he delivered. Swell guy...

The pasta that came with it had barely any sauce and was over cooked. The salad had huge chunks of iceberg lettuce and soggy tomatoes. The garlic bread was ok.

Chicken Parm was delicious!(only reason why they get 2 stars)

Took way too long to order and could barely understand the gentleman taking my order and had to keep repeating things back to him as well as me saying \"I'm sorry what did you just say?\" About 9 times in 15 mins...

Make sure you check your order when you get a delivery as they forget things and then don't make up for the inconvenience. 

Definitely need to work on their customer service and quality of food to stay open in my professiinal opinion."}
{"text":"It has decent food. When its late at night and you want a snack or something to tide you over the food can be good. I typically do not order during the day, but as stated its decent food for the late hours."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the pre-made garbage that most of these places are using (aka the Udi's of Gluten Free Dough) than Napoli is the place to go.   We've ordered here twice and the first time it arrived hot, fresh and delicious but the crust was a little too thin. The next time I ordered I let them know to make the crust a bit thicker and crispier and they did just that. Their customer service is also top-notch even for deliveries. I have yet to experience their customer service and pizza inside the restaurant, but it's definitely on my list of things to do! 

Pros: 
Fresh Hand-Tossed Gluten Free Pizza
Custom Toppings 
Great Price"}
{"text":"This is an unfortunate review that I feel I must write. I moved to Las Vegas 6 years ago and found Napoli through a friend who knows how much I love pizza. I've lived all over the valley and chose Napoli over other places all the time. I convinced coworkers of mine to refer Napoli to guests over other pizza places that provided kickbacks to staff. They were amazing. I've converted households into Napoli pizza only houses. I had only one time where the pizza wasn't right and the manager said no problem, keep that pizza and I'll make you a better one! All of this started to change over the last few months. Delivery would take 2 hours when I was told 1 hour and 15 min. The pizza would come sliced like a kindergartner was playing in the kitchen. I like margarita pizza and they started arriving mushy, only to be told that because there were tomatoes on it, it was mushy. This was never the case before but somehow this time it was my fault. I asked the lady to fix the issue and she was kind enough to bring it back to the chef and bring it back to my table, only to find it was over cooked and burnt in some places. I realized recently the the young lady who used to be the cashier was no longer there. She was sweet as pie but probably had experienced crap changes or new crap management. Other friends of mine mentioned their recent lack of satisfaction with Napoli and I started to realize it wasn't just me...it was Napoli. Very sad and frustrated I gave them another chance. Surprise surprise, my order of one pizza and wings took two hours to arrive. I called to ask for part of my order to be refunded but some incompetent and rude manager who said his name was Bob, said no because they were busy. I told Bob that I expected a call the following day from Victor, the owner, manager or GM but he must not understand how to work a telephone because I never received a call back. The other evening I was going to a friends and said I'd bring some food. My first thought was always Napoli but I had a very bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to call and see if I could get Victor on the phone and possibly give them one last chance. I did and it was the most pointless and sickening phone conversation I've ever had which ended with victor telling me he hopes mine and my moms apartments burn down. Cool, Victor. There's a reason why Napoli sucks so bad now and I see it. You. Oh and by the way, I don't live in an apartment and nor does my mother but you never would have known that because I'd never welcome your trash establishment back to my front doorstep. I'll happily take my business elsewhere and encourage everyone I know and meet to never deal with Napoli pizza."}
{"text":"Heads up to anyone wanting to take out; if they tell you 20-30 minutes, be sure to be prepared to double that. Also, amazing customer service! Just kidding."}
{"text":"I used to go to Napoli once a week.
They have good pizza, no question.

Except I found a place that's significantly better at the same price:
Sicili's Pizza on Twain between Paradise and Swenson. 
There's a young Russian guy there (Napoli is Russians too) named Yuri, who is a pizza savant...a prodigy of pizza.
I don't know how he does it. But he really cares about what he's doing.

It's the crust; it's the ingredients. 
He knows just how long to bake the pizza so that it's soft, chewy, thin, buttery, but not too hard.

In Italy, he'd get an honorary passport."}
{"text":"Not worth the 2-hour wait, and their customer service is equally as bad."}
{"text":"Napoli is one of the few places that has never messed up any of our orders. The pizza is always amazing and even their sandwiches are good. They offer a great variety of food but the reason I keep going back is for the pizza. It's just addicting. The hardest part of going to Napoli is deciding how big of a pizza you want. They have an awesome pick up special for $7.99 where you get a 16 inch 1 topping pizza. I'm saving the 30 inch pizza for a special occasion. They also have Italian soda and homemade lemonade. They are open until 2am and Thursday through Saturday they are open until 3am. The restaurant is kind of small but they have really great lunch specials. Actually.... I'm going to go order a pizza now."}
{"text":"the food was great!!!!and omg I've never eaten a pizza like the one that I  ate here at napolis the best pizza I've tasted so far so gooooodd !!!"}
{"text":"This is our #2 pick  for best pizza in Las Vegas!!  We have always ordered and had delivered, and have never been disappointed and highly recommend to try if. It is a little more $$, but really is worth it. The Ranch dressing is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  I ordered two salads and chicken wings. It took an hour and twenty minutes to receive the order.  When it arrived I only had one salad and not two. When I called to speak to the manager she didn't care and stated well you were not charged for the other salad. You can place another order and I'll waive the $1 processing fee.  She did not care that the order was not completed and acted like it was my fault. This lady talked over me and wanted to argue vs. resolving. She ended up hanging up.  Worst customer service. I would not recommend.  To top it off when we ate the one salad that was delivered there was hair in the salad."}
{"text":"OMG! Best white pizza ever! If you're like me that prefer white pizza over the traditional, you have to try their special white pizza, it's got white sauce, moz & ricotta cheeses, bacon & chicken and they sprinkle herb seasoning on it, also comes w/ a side of marinara, perfect for the crust. Never ordering white pizza anywhere else but here!
Also my hubby loved their Philly steak \"bomb\" sub, it was huge and over stuffed w/ steak, bacon, mushrooms, peppers, & melty Swiss I think(not fake nacho cheese) the fries it came w/ was good too, not soggy and perfectly seasoned.
They're not the cheapest, but for the quality & quantity you get the $ is well spent!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Vegas 100%  
Amazing 30 inch pizza for 8 people at least. 
Fast and friendly delivery. 
I love it !!!"}
{"text":"I knew I had heard this name before & I probably looked it up last year & said no way, but I was starving & there's no places for delivery in this city if you are in this area.

First of all this place is NOT owned by Italians, they are either Russian or Ukrainian or something.

I ordered the following:

1. Veal Marsala - no taste, they don't know they are doing, it was tough & at $17.99, a rip off.

2. They have no beef ravioli, so I had to order the pastrami sandwich which I read had 1000 Island dressing on it. I got French on mine instead (what?) I haven't tried it yet, although I tried to take a bite & it was mostly all bread as it was like thick sub bread.

3. I asked for lemons with my salad, I got none so I can't eat it.

4. I asked for angel hair pasta as my pasta side & I got NO SAUCE. They just poured oil & probably threw a bit of garlic salt on top. It was like eating plain pasta.

5. I asked if their tomatoes were ripe so I could get the salad caprese & they said no, the girl didn't even know what the word ripe meant. I had to ask 3 times & even the guy, who I assume is the owner, said no, they aren't ripe, they are fresh. 

What does that mean? LOL Ripe IS fresh. 

Forget it, they don't even understand English & for a restaurant to admit their produce isn't ripe is (well fill in the blank)

6. I was told $3.50 for delivery, he tried to charge me $4.50 when I called back. While he gave it to me for $3.50, I shouldn't have had to insist.

7. I was charged $1 for using my credit card which is illegal to do, but they all do it here in Vegas.

8. While they weren't mean or anything, they weren't outright friendly either.

I lost $40 (that includes tip) for the 2 items above & the tiramisu (I haven't tried it yet). It probably  isn't real tiramisu."}
{"text":"This location needs to work on customer service and needs to be more professional. I never really had any problems with the food. The food is really good. However their restrooms are always nasty. Do-doo and mess around and in the toilets. I always make sure I go to the bathroom before I come here to eat. It's not really their fault. It's the guests that use the bathroom and don't flush or clean up after themselves. Somebody clean it up ! Very Nasty !!"}
{"text":"I took my family here for lunch yesterday.  The adults had antipasto salads and soup for lunch (minestrone and wedding) and the kids had pasta and chicken tenders.  We had a lot of good food for a low price.  This place is not far from the strip and this local would recommend it to people who have a car on the strip to try it.

This place is casual and good for families.  Around the corner is the bead shack where you can buy beads and take beading classes too if you want a non-Vegas activity for a day."}
{"text":"If I could give the place no stars I would. I was was a loyal customer. They made a mistake on my food and called once I noticed the mistake. The young lady I spoke to on the phone told me to save my receipt and they will fix it tomorrow because I wasn't at home for them to get the sandwiche. I called back today the ass hole on the phone is saying he can give a 10%discount because I didn't have the sandwich from yesterday. I told him I wasn't away that I was suppose to keep the sandwich. I told him. I had my receipt which is the only thing the lady told me to keep. This place is horrible. I will never go back again and their customer service is horrible. If you want food go somewhere else. There are much better places with better service."}
{"text":"Best Pepperoni Pizza .. best cheesesteak hoagies out of the big three on Murray"}
{"text":"I'm sad this place has bad reviews because my family and I often come here and we've never had a single problem. Our pizza is always delicious, we get the wings-yummy & the fries are good too! We sometimes dine in and sometimes take out, but it's always been a fine experience. No complaints. This is one of my favorite pizza places =)"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Napoli twice now. Both times food was hot, arrived as ordered and very good. Quantity for the price is good too in my opinion. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Waited over an hr for one delivery order. Had to call to see where my food was then in a matter of about five minutes my food arrived cold and soaked from the condensation. Needless to say this is the first and only time I will order from them. Very disappointed especially for the price."}
{"text":"Hungry for pizza so decided to give this business a try and it was worth it. The staff was very busy with lunch orders and were on the phone when I came in. They serve lunch specials here and I was in luck to caught the specials. I ended deciding on a sample type plate for $9.99 which is a large slice of cheese pizza, small portion of french fries, 3 buffalo hot wings, and a drink. The cheese slice was so good and fresh too. The buffalo wings were in mild and the sauce was very good with blue cheese sauce on the side of course for dipping.

The twins were with me and I ordered them a small 10 inch pepperoni pizza with mild hot wings too. When I checked in I was offered the free garlic balls and I redeemed them too. So thanks Napoli for thinking about yelpers, they were delicious . And the order was huge not some small sampling it is a large 6oz container and it's topped all over with Parmesan cheese. Dessert is a must and we shared a slice of the chocolate cake. The slice of cake was really dry, but the frosting on it seemed professional done. I enjoyed eating the frosting by itself too since it was so good. Not a bad place to enjoy some pizza among friends."}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza Place in the squirrel hill.

Although I have to say I like their Subs even more than the pizza, (those things are just fresh and perfect.)

Also you can get a 6 pack / some good soda! This place is a win win that locals truly appreciate, many of us have been going for years and years. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Absolute best hot wings in town, (wing dings) love love love it!!!.. They make the ranch sauce which is Bomb too hats off to you guys keep up the outstanding work"}
{"text":"Been eating there over 10 years. The food is good and the portions are generous ... However, the prices at Napoli Pizza have gone through the roof!!! As of this date, they want $17 for baked lasagna!! For pizza and some hot sandwiches, they are fine - otherwise they have priced me out the door."}
{"text":"Didn't dine in, but ordered delivery through grub hub. The order arrived pretty quick, driver was super friendly. My order consisted of parm and garlic wings, chili cheese curly fries, their Philly cheese steak bomb and one of their sausage sandwiches. Everyone enjoyed the food, the wings and curly fries were good. Going to have to try the white pizza next."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't bad...but terrible, and I mean terrible, customer service. My order was botched and the manager insisted that it was my fault. We didn't receive a pizza so I asked if she could have another made quickly and we would pay and pick it up. Her response was, \"No. It's not my fault. You have to wait 35 minutes because I have other customers.\" What. A. Joke."}
{"text":"A great pizza tonight. I used to only eat slices here but tonight I had my two boys with me so we ordered a small pizza with cheese. It was awesome. Not too much cheese, crisp crust. Cooked just right. The guy behind the counter checked on us a few times. Service was great. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Big proportions of crappy tasting food lol. 

Things I ordered and rating:
1. Medium ultimate meat lover pizza-
Very weird taste that I cannot put my fingers on. All in all, pizza hut taste a lot better. This for sure taste like refrigerated food from one week ago being microwaved. I do not like it. Period
2. Curly cheese fries with bacon- this is actually something that earned them a star. It was good, very obvious that it was refrigerated fries but it was still good. I give this a 4/5! 
3. Garlic bread(free with a check in)- taste like absolute garbage. Thank god it was free. 

All in all, it is an okay restaurant if you're stopping in for food while shopping around. I don't recommend this place and I DEFINITELY DONT recommend this for place for ANY OCCASIONS. So boys, don't take your girl here."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience last time I decided to give them another shot(due to late night delivery). I WILL NEVER GO BACK OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE, INCLUDING MY WORST ENEMY.  The service is terrible, it took them over two hours to bring me the food. The driver had an extremely bad attitude. I try never to leave bad reviews but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Pizza here is very good. The only thing is it is a little pricey. Ordered 2 carry out pizza specials and a bucket of fingers and was charged $61.00 so be prepared. I asked for mild fingers and they were to spicy hot to eat. The fries were warm and soggy probably would have been better if they were hot. Watched my order sit on the counter for over 10 minutes and when I asked the blond lady behind the counter she became rude and defensive saying it was just placed there and was very hot because of the warmers they are kept under.  They did not remember we even ordered and there was only one other family in establishment. The only friendly people I ran into in this place was the two cashiers who took my order. My order was def not worth the money I paid."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend was desperately craving for Italian and the menu looked decent. We were quickly seated and ordered white sangria to start. 

The waiter was never there. It took forever to take our orders. I ordered a shrimp pizza while my friend ordered mushroom pasta with meat sauce. The pizza was good. I devoured as much as I could before falling in a food coma. My friend was very happy and exclaimed that it was the best pasta she ever had."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Squirrel Hill. Napoli makes the most New York/New Jersey-like slice you can get in Squirrel Hill. No, it's not as large a slice, but they do a better job than anyone else of getting the sauce and cheese to melt together and live as one."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but not amazing. Very greasy. Only upside is that they deliver. We tried a tiramisu and it was absolutely disgusting. It was dry and they used cake to make it instead of lady fingers. Not worth $5 for that at all."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via yelp to our hotel at the Palazzo. It was fast, hot and amaaaaaazing pizza!! We need to remember this place next time. Open late too!! We were thoroughly satisfied. Fresh ingredients excellent crust and delicious cheese ratio"}
{"text":"PIZZA HUT!! After the whole $10 for any pizza promotion my boy and I started using Pizza Hut.  It is the BEST!!!!!  The thin crust supreme is so good.  we are totally addicted.  We always get the spicy boneless wings, and two large supreme pizzas (so we have left overs) and it comes to about $30.  Staff is friendly and English speaking.  The delivery is fast."}
{"text":"Best slices off the top in Pittsburgh. Award winning pepperoni! .....Consistency is its #1 seller......tastes the same for 40 years I've been going!!!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town
I enjoyed my pizza with bottle of red wine and free garlic balls was heavenly 
Great job guys"}
{"text":"too much tension between staff. Order was incorrect and very over priced, we dinner in and we heard 2 complaints from customers."}
{"text":"My sister and I have been here at least 6 times and every single time we have come we've had to wait. Wait on someone to acknowledge us, wait for someone to take our order, wait for someone to bring out our food, and wait on some one to bring us our bill. I didn't even bother putting wait for refills because no one even bothers to ask if we want any. And I understand that they are busy but the way that they run this pace is unacceptable. The last time we came we were here for 3 hours. Whenever I needed anything I had to get up and locate a server or else I would've been sitting there for longer. They seriously need to rethink how they do customer service here."}
{"text":"I order from Napoli's atleast two/three times a month, every time that I order the pizza it is good. Last night after a 12 hour shift, I stopped by to get dinner. I ordered the 5 piece mild finger and fries for $9.99. First off that price is a bit steep for a 5 piece and fries, especially without a drink. The lady asked how would I like my fingers. \"mild\" Okay mild is mild... I get home and began to eat my \"mild\" fingers, and to my surprise the fingers where EXTREMELY HOT! As I stated I worked a long day, needless to say I called it a night and ate something from home, and went to bed. I woke up, called Napoli's at 10:00 am. I asked for a manager,and the person who answered the phone says\" I am an employee how can I help you. Now, I don't know about you, but when I call a business and ask to speak with a manager that is WHO I want to speak with...a person claiming to be the \"manager\" got on the phone. I explained the situation. He literally said that \"you should of called last night, and because I waited and called this morning there is nothing he could do for me!\" I almost hit the floor. I explained that I still have the food. I couldn't finish it, because it was too HOT. He then ask me if,I asked the waiter \"how exactly is the mild!\" HUH, REALLY!!!!! So, he then begins to explain that their mild and hot are composed of a hot sauce with crushed peppers which makes it spicy. He then says well the mild is spicy, but not hot. After going NO WHERE with this person I finally said that although the pizza is good, I will not patronize  business who would rather lose a customer than replace the food. I told the \"manager\" that I will tell all my friends/coworkers/ son's football team about their service. I also told him that I would be writing this review, to share my experience. In the end, the conversation went nowhere. I was really surprised that his stance was \"I didn't call last night, so therefore he can do nothing about it!\""}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  I have had their pizza couple times before and this
last time will be the last time!  The pizza was cold with almost no cheese on it.  I guess the two topping special must be cheese as one of the selections or you don't get any.  Then we were charged TWO delivery fees for one address.  NOpoli"}
{"text":"I use to live in Las Vegas from 08-2010 and used to come to this place all the time. I am pretty sure it's a Russian money laundering joint. I am kidding of course (maybe), but I am Russian and every time I come to this place there is people speaking Russian on the phone and I am pretty sure it's not about Pizza.
Just visited the place again and nothing has changed.. Very good quality pizza for a great price (maybe a little too good?) The carryout special is a fantastic deal and the service is good as well..(maybe a little too good?). Will be coming back, for the pizza, and maybe a salad. Don't hurt my family."}
{"text":"1st time coming to this location and service was great! Jesica was always on top of things definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Welp ordered combo app platter and a lrg bbq chicken pizza and when they delivered the food it was cold, soggy and tasted strange. When my boyfriend called to sort out a replacement the girl speaking on the phone hung up on him. When I called the girl that picked up said she was the manager. So I explained my dissatisfaction with the food she began to tell me there was nothing she could do. After a few moments of frustration she put me on hold. Another girl picked the phone up and asked what the problem was and explained that she was the manager. Well as to no surprise I'm very frustrated at this point. The reason I originally had asked to speak to a manager its so I wouldn't have to repeat myself 3 different times.  While I was expressing my want for a refund this girl kept interrupting me and being rude. Finally after back and forth I was placed on hold again....low and behold I guess now I was finally speaking to the actual manager. The only reason the place even gets 1 star is because after a few minutes he finally arranged a refund.  Sucky pizza..sucky customer service..not cool!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

We went here for lunch yesterday, and there are so many mon-fri lunch specials for $7.99 (entrée & drink). One of our friends is a regular here, as her day job is around the corner.

It was nice outside so we opted for al fresco dining. One of our friends got a calzone, the other got the blackened chicken salad (came with garlic bread), my husband got the philly (came with fries), and I got the ravioli (came with garlic bread). I really liked the pasta- was good size, cheesy, and al dente, I don't get that too much, because we really don't go to Italian restaurants much, except for maybe, Buca Di Beppo or Strings. Our friend says she's tried many of their menu items because her coworkers order from here all the time.  

I didn't know what to order, because there were so many lunch special choices. After seeing what we all got (and everyone liked it too), I want to try some other things on the menu. Free refills on the drinks, too.

The staff was all very nice. Service was quick. As we were sitting out there, noticed four delivery men walking back to the restaurant. It's a busy place for lunch; it's obvious there is a ton of repeat business. Inside ambiance is very nice. Red checkered table cloths, and looks very Italian-restaurant themed, too. Bathroom is inside as well.  

I want to try more! I'm sure we'll be back again."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this pizzeria for over 2 years. They have been delivering to my job this whole time.... now all of a sudden they want to know your home address and phone number over the phone rather than seeing your drivers license when they deliver the food. I asked to speak to the manager because I do not feel comfortable giving all that information just for food and she told me \"if you want the food give me your address if not then I'll cancel the order.\" That makes no logical sense to me why they would need my address telephone number I'm not feeling out a credit app."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Very busy. I like that they have setting outside. You get alot of food for your money. And with your meal they give you a 2liter of soda.. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"We saw a commercial for this place the night before leaving Vegas, so we figured it might be a good spot to grab a bite before hitting the road. It's nestled in the middle of a half-abandoned shopping center, but it wasn't too hard to find for an out-of-towner like myself. The front register was run by a couple of tough-looking Eastern Euro chicks, one of which seemed annoyed that I couldn't understand what she was asking through her thick accent. 

Before food came, I had to use the bathroom. Normally, this would be a nonevent. However, the bathroom can only be found after navigating a labyrinthine maze of doors. I was concerned I'd wind up getting locked out of at least one of them, which would have led to a damn long walk back to the front. But I survived. Food came, and it looked like hammered shit. Seriously. So consider me surprised when I dug in to find that it was actually really damn good. We got a small pizza and some chicken tenders. I was kinda \"meh\" on the tenders. So rare is it that I get chicken fingers that don't taste like store brand crap. But the pizza here was really good. Cheesy, great sauce, crisp crust... just about everything I require in a good slice."}
{"text":"This place is just awful. Don't get me wrong the food is fine but every time I come here the food takes forever. Even if I order 30 minutes in advance the food is never ready and I have to end up waiting at least 30 minutes every darn time. The employees never know what's going on and more times than not they'll give you attitude. Never returning."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time, because we got a flier in the mail, and when I called to place my order, i asked about the advertisement on free garlic balls. Apparently the app is broken and she said i had to leave a yelp comment and show her the comment for the free. Well i called back to let her know it was done and inform her that my review was up and screen shotted my coupon. She said i couldnt have my boss pick up the order cause she needs my phone to be there. So i couldnt use it. I said to cancel the garlic balls because she was just asking me to do way too much for what's advertised and that we would be there to pick up the rest of the order... and i just called back to change my order to from pick up to delivery and found out that my ENTIRE order was cancelled, more or less because I said they are being ridiculous for making me jump through hurdles due to their app being malfunctioned.  Thats not customer service.  I hope the manager is on duty,  because I definetely need to discuss this with someone other than the one who takes the orders."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner on their website that redirected me to deliver service.  I waited over an hour for food that not only arrived ice cold, but was someone else's order. I called and spoke to a girl to which I told what happened.  She put me on hold and no one ever came back.  I had to call back and spoke to a man that told yes I did get some else order and he would send me another order.  Of course this would take time, and he wanted to pick up the food I had opened up.  I asked for a refund an no more food.  I ordered soup and chicken wings, and fries.  The food that arrived was not good, sitting in a pool of sauce. I can't speak for their pizza as I have not tried it. I was informed my refund could take 7-10 days. This was my 1st encounter with this restaurant and will be my last."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Napoli several times when I didn't really feel like going out because it's super close to me. I've only ever ordered the gyro combo, so I can't comment on the other food. 

The gyro is pretty tasty, but I wish it had more meat. (That's what she said.)

My biggest complaint is how long it takes to deliver the food. They routinely take 45+ mins. One time I ordered and it took so long that I forgot I placed an order until the driver showed up an hour and a half later with a little bit of an attitude.

Other than that, not a bad place. Definitely room for improvement though."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I love pizza and it says a lot if I can manage to finish a whole pie. For dessert I had to have the illy affogato."}
{"text":"Iv been ordering from them since 2008. 
They always deliver quickly, food is fresh and hot. 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Hardly expected to be in an Italian joint our first night in Montreal, but it was highly recommended by our concierge, and it certainly delivered.  I love a place with an old school Italian waiter to greet you and talk food with you. Was just as pleased with the 70 or so pizza options!  Simply a nice, delicious, reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"worst service ever. pizza was good... Need more professional people with customer service skills"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. 10 min to 3 i was told no more slices and they will not make another pie for slices. Lunch s9ecials run until 3.  Wow. Thisnis jot the first time.  I work right across the street. Will never gonhere again.  I guess they do not need customers.  Or at least hapoy ones.  They obviously do not care.  I suggest little ceasrs before coming here."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if there customer service and their delivery service isn't so long but other then that there food is fantastic! I usually go for the burgers and wings. Definitely a place to try for those with a huge appetite."}
{"text":"This rating reflects Napoli's wings and fries. Big, juicy wings offered in several flavors. Like, garlic parmesan, teriyaki, lemon pepper, bbq, hot, mild, medium, possibly others. I'm not a fan of hot wings so I get garlic parm and lemon pepper. I love that they come in a white sauce instead of oil (eek). 
Napoli also has great fries. I hate to order fries to go because by the time I get home it usually get's soggy. Napoli fries surprisingly did not! It's made with some sort of coting which makes it pretty yum. My friend things it's fried in flour and I think it's fried in the same oil as curly fries (YES THEY GOT CURLY FRIES!) and the residue from the curly fries sticks to regular. Either way, the fries is pretty good. 
I am personally not a fan of their pizza, I find it to be soggy and flavorless. I may give it another try at some point but for now, I will stick to the wings. They are DAMN good!
This location gets pretty busy. If you are ordering to go and they tell you 30-40 min, it'll probably mean 1 hour. You can give your phone number and they will call you when it's ready. Ordering out while you're starving on a busy night may prove aggravating so don't fret, eat a snickers while you wait :)"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE this place.. I order pizza and wings for delivery about once a week.. But last night it was absolutely horrible... My pizza was burnt and old.. The wings weren't cooked right because I got completely sick after eating them. Damn it kind of sucks... It looks like I'm going to have to try and find a new favorite wing place..."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait for delivery. The alfredo was ok but way over priced. The garlic bread wasn't great. The chicken wings are huge and they were good, at a decent price during lunch. I will order some where else next time."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  They act like it bothers them to help the customer. The servers are rude they don't make eye contact because they know they are rude ! They have forgotten that because of the neighborhood customers like myself is the very reason why they are still in business!! To the owner.: send your people thru customer service training fast!!!!! Hire people who value their job and not just collecting a check !"}
{"text":"100 % Authentic Italian!! Terrific Service, Super friendly & Helpful. Very extensive menu with tons of very affordable options. HOME of the 30\" Giant Pizza. Small eat-in area but very clean & Welcoming. The wings are large & meaty cooked perfectly & OH so HOT!!! If you order them HOT be ready they are HOT!!! They have teriyaki style and many other choices. The pizza is the BEST NY style we've had here in Las Vegas and at a great price. Thin & slightly crispy with REAL cheese, well seasoned sauce and REAL pepperoni, not that HORMEL stuff. As soon as we finished we wanted another one. I highly recommend Napoli and we will be regulars."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the 1st time to Napoli's Pizza expecting a great new experience. 
What we ended up having was such terrible experience that we had to share it with everyone at work the very next day. After looking through  their very large menu my wife decided to order a  bacon-cheeseburger and I chose a pastrami sandwhich.The waitress took our order fairly quickly and she was polite, but then we waited and waited and waited. We see there are other customers who had arrived after us yet they were receiving their pizzas, wings and what looked like stromboli's or stufed pizzas. We kept looking at and signaling towards a large bald man that looked like the manager/ owner , we did the same signaling to the two girls who were on pc's and on the phone apparently taking phone orders. They would talk to each other, point towards us and they seemed to be asking each other what was going on. We waited over 35 minutes for a burger and a sandwich  and yet no one ever came to ask us anything and no one came to tell us how much longer it would be before we would get our order.
Finally we decided to walk out and find something else to eat, shockingly we passed in front of over 5 employees including what looked like the owner or manager and no one even spoke  a word to us or ask us why we were leaving.This was a horrible experience and we will never visit again."}
{"text":"Sausage pizza was great, but the cheese bread on the other hand, looked awesome! but was not the bidness what so ever.  :("}
{"text":"This is our go to delivery place at work! They have such a wide variety, and the prices are decent for as much food as they supply in a meal. They stay open late too, which is so convenient. We have had very few mistakes in the years we have been ordering from them. As I have never stepped foot in the actual restaurant, they have a loyal customer on the other end of the phone."}
{"text":"Why one star? Because no stars is not an option. The food was subpar, they admitted to basically opening a can of clams and dumping it on linguini, no garlic or onion added, hell no salt and pepper either, and who puts whole Bay Leaf in their clam sauce for god's sake??? My wife's French dip came as ordered without the cheese and mushrooms but the meat was dry, dry like my belt. The  women who answered the phone tried to be helpful but had to pass me to the manager who basically told me that if I had a problem with their food, it was my problem, not his. I've had better Italian food at chain restaurants. Both my wife and I have run restaurants in the past and we'd never have let that food out of the kitchen.
Napoli's is a big stay away!"}
{"text":"Great first time delivery experience. I love a great antipasto salad! Bread is also great you're now my new local pizza joint. I'll be ordering delivery again soon I'll try something new next time also"}
{"text":"Have to feed a bunch of people on the cheap? BUT you don't want it to be bad food? Ya know, sometimes when you get into those large quantities of food the quality drops. Welp, not at Naploi's. 

I was working at the Barrett Joackson Car Auction at Mandalay Bay and we had a lot of hungry workers to feed. Of course pizza is a go to in a situation like that. We called up Napoli's and ordered three 30-inch pizzas. One with half plain cheese, and half veggies. The other two we got the meat lovers. 

First off - awesome they could deliver to us at the Auction as it was a busy event and the pizza delivery person had to call us and park in a parking lot not on the property. He waited for us to walk out to get the pizzas.

Everyone who was eating the pizza said the same thing: GREAT PIZZA! I personally thought the cheese was the best part. The meat was plentiful, as were the veggies. The meat pizza was a bit too greasy for me, but it was still good. But the veggie one was amazing! So many vegetables! They did not skimp. Although, I do think there were a bit too many onions. I picked a bunch off my slice, but hey, some people may like that many. *shrug*

Obviously I've never dined-in, but the delivery service is awesome and the pizzas made a whole lot of hungry people VERY happy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and price was great. Their pick up special is awesome .  Definately gonna eat here again"}
{"text":"My wife and decided to try this place because it was close and we had been bombarded with their Togo menus.  It was raining as we walked in.  We ordered a supreme pizza, a coke, zepolli, and fried ravioli Togo.  We ate our ravioli in the restaurant while we waited on our pizza and the storm to finish. The employees continually yelled back at the kitchen wondering where our order was. Several times we were told it would be out on just a minute. One time we heard the guy in back say we had to put another one in. After an hour, our pizza finally came out.  I asked if it was normal to take so long ( mainly because we watched them take delivery orders on the phone, people who came ordered and left with their pizza, and still other patrons who came Sat down, had appetizers and pizza and still finished before we received our order). The lady behind the counter answered me saying that with the rain, they just get busy.  I just love being lied to and pushed away.  I love people who cannot be accountable, especially when those people are business owners.  At the very least, an apology for the wait may have been appropriate, alas we received nothing but a \"we are busy\". 
Well our pizza was not very good... It was edible but we have had much better in this city for the price.  The zepolli were cold because they made them before the hour long pizza.  Zepolli do not reheat well.  
If this is normal and according to the ratings and reviews on facebook, it is, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Napoli Pizzeria.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. They offer pretty decent New York-style pizza, and delivered in a reasonable amount of time (about 60 minutes - that's not bad for quality pizza on a Friday night). 

My favorite Vegas pizza place for New York-style pizza is the often-crowded Secret Pizza at the Copsmpolitan, but this could definitely be a close second. My friends loved the Caesar Salad too. We'll definitely keep them in mind for next time."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza 1st and foremost. Loved the potato skins w sour cream.  Great prices. We will come eat here when in vegas. Totally worth it !"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. 
The owner is always so professional and always welcoming and friendly. 
They provide super fresh delicious food. I'm absolutely a fan of Napolis Pizzeria. 
The location is so convenient, I never have an issue with parking. 
The atmosphere is so beautiful. 
They are always so very courteous and welcoming. (Did I mention that already) ;) 
I absolutely love the chicken Caesar salad so YUMMY! 
We've ordered pizzas, chicken wings, deserts and about everything in the menu. I have not been disappointed at all and doubt I will ever be. 

I will never order or eat pizza, chicken Caesar salad or chicken wings from anywhere else but Napolis. (My Fav!)
Caution: when you order spicy chicken wings, you better be sure about that...lol (So yummy!) 
 
They provide fast response on all orders and delivery is always quick and courteous. 

I absolutely stand 100% by them and recommend them to everyone in Las Vegas.

Thanks Napolis Pizzeria for providing the best!"}
{"text":"Food is still good here but whats up with the service some times. I ordered 2 pizzas this night and wanted to get some wings as well. I have always ordered them Plain with the hot sauce on the side to keep them crispy on the way home. The Person who was helping me looked to be the manger wanted to charge extra just to do that. Charging to have sauce on the side on chicken wings WTF, Really? In the past they never did this. I told them to skip wings then. I'll give my money to some place else."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Ordered Boneless wings fries & garlic knots. They told me one hour and I was fine with that. Was delivered in one hour. Had the wings plain and hot and spicy teriyaki onside. The spicy teriyaki buffalo and teriyaki mixed.. not a fan! The garlic knots are bomb. The wings where average. Better then pizza hut or dominos. The prices are not bad. Dislike ordering delivery but this one I didn't regret!"}
{"text":"I live pretty close to this place so the pickup pizza is worth it. 

Delivery is insanely slow, don't bother. 

The pizza is solid, the wings are good, the fried ravioli should be avoided as it is prefrozen. They have a pretty awesome selection of salads though, as silly as that sounds, and their broccoli cheese soup was pretty good. 

All in all, good late night drunk meal, I wouldn't rave about it, but I go here fairly often so something's gotta be good lol."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for maybe about 2 years I come in at least 3 times a months,There pizza is always good never have I had any problems here with or are order, despite the wait for the pizza & wings to come out this place is awesome,the prices for this place are also really reasonable,I would recommend to come check it out for your self"}
{"text":"Three Iconic pizza places in the same block.  Napoli's is hands down the best.  The other two beat any chain hands down, but Napoli's is tops.  We had about 15 people over the to the house and had a blind taste test.  Locals, a couple of southerns, some Swedes, a Venezuelan.  Napoli's pepperoni beat the other two hands down.  Better than most NYC joints and ALL Chicago pizzerias."}
{"text":"Two hours later the pizza showed up cold. After calling the manager they refused to refund anything and are \"making a new pizza\" that will be here after 10pm. They do not care about customer service at this place and we will never purchase from here again."}
{"text":"Their pizza is good but everything else is subpar. I waited over 40 minutes to get a blue cheese cheeseburger that was way over cooked. The fries are not very good and they also came out lukewarm. I dined in and was never asked how my meal was until I was leaving, which when I explained that I was very disappointed, I got the oh I'm so sorry. Nothing else. They should at least ask you how your meal is a couple minutes after they serve it to you, it's called a 2-minute follow up. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"First of all let me say this the food is absolutely fantastic. But the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I have had delivery once and eaten in the restaurant and all three times the service was terrible. 

Today was by far the worse as far as service and as far as paying the check. We found out when we got home that they had double charged us. When I called the Manager refused to batch out the credit cards till it was convenient for him.  I told him about the poor service and he asked why we came back and i told him we try and give a place a few chances and he was cocky about it and did not take the complaints serious."}
{"text":"AWFUL EXPERIENCE! They use SEWAGE WATER to make their pizza!!!! Napoli Pizza! U use to be my go-to spot for pizza, pasta, and wings. But over the past 2 years the food has got worse! VERY inconsistent! Pizza is undercooked and sloppy and tatses like they use unfiltered tap water! Our pasta was overcooked! And swimming in water!! Gross!! And the fried mushrooms used to be good! Now they're mush! We spent over $40! And got crap food and service! They said they could only give us a $4 credit!?!? Are u guys serious??! Sadly, you guys lost me as a customer. I won't be ordering from here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"food was good but the service was terrible. the waiter was rude and got our order wrong even though we were one of two tables in the entire restaurant. we chose to not say anything and just ate our food. still, the waiter was not attentive, failed to refill our water over and over, and rolled his eyes if asked to."}
{"text":"Napoli is the best place for pizza and wings and  garlic knots lidia is the best worker there"}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni with wings and drinks. Pizza was delicious.. Service was great. My babies got small kiddie drinks. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"We went there with s big group and ordered the big 30 inch divided in to four different flavors. We also ordered the Buffalo wings and a hummus plate. The food was reasonably priced, and it came out to us in a reasonable amount if time. The pizza was delicious as was the hummus plate. The wings were tasty, though the sauce came from a bottle. One thing I would like is if the soda machine was accessible so that we don't have to wait for someone to come refill the drunk for us. This was my second time eating here, and I will eat here agIn. I have no experience with the delivery."}
{"text":"This is a consistently good pizza place. After finally going inside the restaurant instead of ordering delivery, I thought I'd finally do a review. The counter service was pleasant, and the place was steady for a Sat afternoon.  No wonder because as usual the pizza was delicious. We used a yelp coupon for free garlic knots-- and wow. They were great. Napoli is the the only place in the neighborhood we get pizza from. We prefer it over the large chains. A large 1 topping pick up is $8.99. I mean, that is an excellent deal."}
{"text":"A lot of food for very little $. The wings are awesome, $1 for a extra large portion of fries when you get an appetizer, free garlic balls with check in, with that you can feed 3-4 people on $20. This place is equipped with nice TVs so you can catch the game. Order the white pizza if you're a garlic lover, the crust is perfect and in general the pizza isn't overly greasy like other places."}
{"text":"Great place for a family meal. We get the enormous size pizza which is plenty to share. Staff is always friendly and prompt on service.  Restaurant offers outdoor patio seating which is always a plus on a nice day."}
{"text":"Took a chance on Napoli while we were in town. Our food arrived literally two hours after we ordered. I made numerous calls to the restaurant to see where the pizza was. After 2 hours the pizza finally comes ...no apology for the inconvience, no reason for why it took so long. Pizza was cold and seemed like it had been sitting for about 15 minutes. For what's its worth the pizza was good but the service was definitely crappy."}
{"text":"This corner is a great Montreal italian secret. The food is inexpensive and good! Like beyond any haute cuisine you will find in Montrel."}
{"text":"I love the garlic knots. They're buttery, greasy, cheesy, delicious little morsels made just for clogging your arteries. Sometimes we just need that in our lives.

Besides the little buttery heart-stoppers, I've enjoyed their chicken fingers. Honestly, nothing special, just your average bar quality, frozen to fryer chicken fingers, but again, sometimes we just need that in our lives. They do have a pretty hefty selection of sauces which is great. It's nice to mix it up.

I'll probably eat here again, they deliver but don't order if you're already hungry. You'll eat the couch before they arrive. Maybe it was just a busy day, I'll update my review if it's faster next time."}
{"text":"4 stars for Pittsburgh.  This was our pizza standby for years.  Good enough that even the plain is good. 

Eating in is sometimes unpleasant, what with the TV blaring, etc.  And the staff only warmed up to us after 4 years.  Spinach and onion calzone is pretty damn good, probably better than the pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a small four topping pizza on yelp eats and figured I'd get the sausage, pepperoni and deluxe like the picture showed.  I guess I didn't pick my toppings so instead of calling me and letting me know I didn't pick any toppings they took two hours, gave me a cheese pizza and still charged me for the four topping pizza."}
{"text":"Good portions and delicious pasta. The ice cream bar is also filled with unique flavours that you may have never tried before! The owner is very friendly too :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza place in Las Vegas, I came today with my gf to get some pizza here and then another to go, which took
1 hour to get the pizza (to go) because they messed up the order, so meanwhile we were waiting for the second pizza, we were eating the first one which tbh it tasted alright. The service is awful, there are like 4 waitress and waiters doing pretty much nothing, they don't ask you if you need anything else, even when they see that you run out of drinks and all the cups are empty, they didn't even tell us to \"Enjoy the Pizza\" or anything like that... Tbh worst pizza place ever"}
{"text":"Wow their monster pizza is just that it is a MONSTER! It's ginormous! Definitely something fun to order for a super bowl party or get together of friends. The pizza was pretty good. They didn't skimp on the toppings which is nice but it wasn't my favorite. The crust was a little soggy for my liking and they put the brocolli stems as a topping as  well. Usually you have just the florets but they chopped up the stems and put them on their like soggy bell pepper. Kind of weird. 

We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks which were okay, they tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. The fried mushrooms weren't very good, half were overcooked/burnt. The potato skins were dried out and lacked flavor. I did enjoy the Italian wedding soup though. It has good flavor and tons of pasta and meatballs. 

Probably wouldn't order delivery from them again considering that the only thing I enjoyed was the soup."}
{"text":"Friendly excellent service and a very nice pizza pie!"}
{"text":"If you love fries like me, you need to order the fries from here! 
I don't know how they make it, but it's sooo damn good. 
I got the chili cheese fries & 4 topping pizza which I got to choose what to put on it. 
For the pizza, I choose pepperoni, italian sausage, green peppers & mushrooms. The size I got was the 18inch large. The slices were very large & the box was huge!! Very cheesy & the crust was on point! 
The fries, omggg, I actually wish I'd gotten just a regular fry w/o the chili cheese b/c it ended up being too much beans (became a fart machine...) & got soggy. But the texture & the taste of the fries were like heaven~~~"}
{"text":"Love the 16\" carry out special for 1 topping. Get it cut in squares with ranch and you will be a happy camper! It has occasionally been greasy, but what pizza isn't from time to time? Only thing that bugs me sometimes is that the employees are not always 100% attentive and nice to their customers."}
{"text":"My family was looking around Vegas for something that we don't have in Hawaii and we ended up stopping at Napoli Pizzeria. 

Pros-
*A medium pizza is huge. It can feed 4 Adults 
*Server was very friendly 
*The have 2x more take out/deliveries than dine in

Cons-
*It was really loud 
*When we got there, the table we sat on was dirty

I would greatly recommend this place for parties. Their pizzas can be huge and it would feed a lot of people for a good price. 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I just received an email from yelp saying that my review has been deleted. I am extremely confused, because I was extremely truthful in my review. I ordered  three giant size pizzas with drinks, and the total came up to almost $100. I called the night before to have the order ready by 11 AM. I called in the morning to confirm my order and they said that they were making it. When I got there at 11 AM I stood at the front counter for 15 minutes before somebody even acknowledge that I was there. Finally when the cashier asked if she can help me, I asked for my order and it wasn't ready. She then asked me if I could wait 30 minutes so that they can complete the order. I explained to her that the food was for a business meeting and that I have been bragging about Napolis pizza. I had no other choice but to wait 30 minutes and have my fellow colleagues and boss wait for me. On top of that my boss would call me every two minutes to check and see where I was. This was my review, And this was my experience maybe some of you have had better experiences but unfortunately this was mine and it was the last time that I ever went to Napolis, or ever referred somebody to this restaurant. Amazing pizza though"}
{"text":"We are impressed!!! Great restaurant!!! Best one in Las Vegas. Excellent food & excellent service.
It's a big restaurant with very good service, delicious food, and it has fast delivery.
Will definitely come back to this restaurant every time we are in Vegas. They even have a bar & also serve desserts like cake. 
Strongly suggest this place to EVERYONE....."}
{"text":"we have been going to Napoli's pizza for a very long time, food was always good service was always decent.I ordered delivery and the driver was an hour and a half late, couldn't believe it. I called a half hour after the driver was supposed to have been here and they told me he left 15 minutes ago.....one hour later he showed up. But the service tonight was terrible, this girl was being argued with by the guys that run the place because her soda was flat. They refused to give her a fresh one and they would not even give her a refill on a fountain drink I could not believe how terrible they treated her. My girlfriend and I were disgusted at the way they treated her. We will NEVER return to Napoli's pizza again and I assume that girl and her family will never return. I enjoy customer service, Napoli's finally got bad enough to lose me...the food isn't good enough to warrant treating people like that."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery Friday night and it was delivered perfectly on time. The food was delicious, portions were great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at Napolis and sad to say the last time. Always liked the veal sandwiches at this place but now they're using those fake substandard patties. Absolutely gross if you're use to the real thing. I spoke to a waitress but instead of answering my question she just ignored it and asked if my son wanted a refill on his soda. We both left the food and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"$18 for the Pastry Pizza that's advertised as having Nutella on it...don't waste your money. It doesn't have Nutella on it,  it has chocolate syrup and it's dry and disgusting. Also if you complain they will argue with you,  then send the delivery driver back to pick it up before they will refund you. Oh and they'll also hang up on you."}
{"text":"This place should rename themselves to orgasmic pizza or something of that nature. Thanks to my scooby doo crew down the street giving me the best referral a girl could ask for, aka this pizza spot, my mouth just had the priviledge of having a series of orgasms, one after another, all over my mouth and tongue!! The funny thing is... our local friend already knew this place and had ordered from them several times for one delicious pizza after another, just didn't know the name off hand, nor had he been to their location. 

Wooo! Yeah! So... there was three of us to feed and I didn't want there to be a shortage of pizza and/or us to be scavenging through the cupboards of our beloved friend's house late night tonight, so I wanted to go big, real big. I ordered the extra large pizza, aka 24 inches of pure pleasure (half pesto, half italian sausage) and a greek salad for the road. The salad was anything short of toppings and the pizza was so monsterous, we had to put it in the trunk of my SUV! We barely chipped away at half of it between the three of us. Crazy! 

Whoa-- the pie itself was ahhhhmazing. Dough made fresh, in-house and completely soft with a touch of browned/burntness around the edges. Another yelper said epic, I will have to second that notion. EPIC PIZZA to start off an EPIC HALLOWEEN. 

Their pizzas here are consistantly good (based on our temporary roomates reports) and never fall short of perfect. There was no shortage of staff to help the patrons and answer the phones as well.

The dining area was small and casual, with lots of eye candy to browse around and look at. In other words there was nothing fancy about it, except the orgasmic pizza and the screamin' Greek Salad! :) The staff was exceptionally nice as well!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would! Ok so I ordered online for a pepperoni and spinach pizza. On top of charging an extra two dollars per topping I received a pizza with maybe 10 pepperonis and and about 8 leaves of spinach. As my son I were finished eating the pizza I noticed a black small wavy hair melted into the cheese on the top of his pizza! At that point my stomach turned and I called the place. This less than sympathetic woman and I basically give her the run down. After being on hold twice she then asks me can they make me another pizza. Which I declined because at this point I dont want us to eat anymore hair. So she said that all she can give me is a measly 5 dollar credit. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN! BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY!"}
{"text":"Stopped over Murray Ave to see what was shaking at the banjo shop and stopped in Napoli for a couple slices. It was right after lunch and not too busy, there was only a couple tables of Cops loitering, er, I mean lunching and that's it. The Pizzeria is set up like your typical slice shop, with the added bonus that you can buy Beer(+1), also. I tried a Pepperoni roll and a slice of pepperoni with a Coke. The roll came with a side of sauce and was quite tasty, well, where there was pepperoni it was tasty. I had a couple bites that was only dough(-1). The slice was also good, a nice thin slice with thinly sliced pepperoni that curls when cooked. As I was sitting down the Owner pulled a sausage pie from the oven, mmmm ground hot sausage(+1). HELLO! So, I had one of those, too. And it was yummy, too. I had a great conversation with the owner and another customer that came in after me.
 All in all, even tho I am a big fan of Mineo's, I would and will definitely give these guys more business."}
{"text":"I Ordered delivery from here and used my debit card. I called before the order came to make sure the driver had five dollars on him so I could tip him five dollars as I only had a 10. The girl that answered the phone rudely informed me that even though I paid with the card I would need to pay another dollar and change for the jalapeños I ordered on the fries as if I was trying to get away with something. Not a problem I did just that. My order has come I paid the extra plus a extremely generous tip and no jalapeños and the chili cheese fries taste like gas station chili cheese fries"}
{"text":"This was an awesome pizza, the delivery had alittle trouble all because our stupid gate code wasn't working properly, but other than that awesome service and quick response"}
{"text":"This place advertises it is the \"Home of the 30\" pizza\".  Although it will feed a hungry family, and does taste really, really, REALLY good, I'd hope the owner reads this review and decides to market this place on something other than a giant pizza: the \"Chicago Deep Dish Stuffed\" Pizza.

It's on the menu, buried at the bottom of the pizza menu, just above the cold sandwich menu.  It's slightly highlighted, stating \"14\" for $21.99!\", but you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it.

But you won't miss it my trusty Yelp follower, because I'm here to tell you it is on the menu, and you should try it. Wait, change that, you MUST try it.

Take it from someone who's eaten at Lou Malnati's, Giordano's, Uno's and Gino's in Chicago (I'm pretty sure that's the \"Big 4\" and those who all claim to have invented the Chicago Deep Dish); this is the BEST DEEP DISH you can get outside the Chicago area.  Since we're in Vegas, I'd even say I'd put money on that statement.  Go ahead and try it, then come back here and disagree with me.

Since I was here, feeding a family of 13, I also ordered the #10 $30.99 (16\" Pizza with 1 topping, 10 Chicken Fingers, 2 liter soda and added fries for $1.00 more).  The \"regular\" pizza was a little better than any pizza you can get, anywhere else.  The garlic Parmesan chicken fingers were really good (crunchy on the outside, juicy in the inside, with just the right amount of seasoning).  The kids devoured the plate of fries, which had a batter or seasoning on them which gave them a flourly texture (very good).  

The service was top notch!  Our waitress was so kind and understanding.  She took care of a table which primarily consisted of children under age 6 like a pro.  

I rarely do this, but I went up to the counter to tell our waitress this was the BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza I've had outside Chicago, and she humbly accepted the compliment.  She thanked me over and over again for saying so and asked me to please, make sure I told everyone I knew about it.  I intend to keep that promise, starting here.

So if you're in Vegas, stop by Napoli's (they've got three locations and another coming soon), and try the deep dish.  You'll be glad you did, and you'll feel cool about saying \"Yeah, I've been eating the deep dish since before they were famous for it\"."}
{"text":"Super disappointed, I ordered one of the x-large pizzas at 1:25 am. The estimated wait time was an hour which is super reasonable. 3 am comes and my driver finally calls saying he's outside with the food. What!!?!? Pizza should NEVER take 1 hour and 30 minutes to make & deliver."}
{"text":"I always have came here theses new people suck bad service since I walked in not good I liked this place a lot not nomore don't think will be coming back rude service chick bad attitude came to refill drinks one time the whole 40 min been here had to get up and get my own drinks what's the point feeling pissed off couldn't even enjoy our diner"}
{"text":"I got half taco and alfredo pizza and it was so delicious! I also got the 6 piece wing half lemon pepper and half honey BBQ.

Service was awesome but the food took forever to come out. Only reason I'm giving three stars is because to get to the restroom you had to go through three hallways. It literally looks like a scene from a scary movie."}
{"text":"They have my order saved at this place. I love their wings. They're delicious. Their pizza is a little greasy and soggy for my taste but it's still pretty good. My bf and I get both and I eat the wings he eats the pizza."}
{"text":"I'M IN LOVE WITH THEIR BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA!!! 

I used to call in my orders from the school I worked at down the street...now that I don't frequent the area much I have to make a trip out of it...FYI lunch is between 9am-3pm...they have some awesomely amazing lunch specials and super affordable prices! Can't go wrong with anything that has BBQ sauce on it...it's like BBQ Crack! Really it's THAT good! Hubs likes the wings lunch special...mounds of chicken wings in whatever sauce you want delicious battered fries and a soda on the side. Wish they had a location on the west side of town :("}
{"text":"We had late night craving the other night and since not much is open, we decided to order from Napoli. Reviews aren't that good and is only 3 stars but to my surprise, the wings are the best i've had in Vegas so far. They are tasty and moist unlike most pizzeria's that serves dry and basic tasting wings. The only problem is the delivery time takes up to an hr or so."}
{"text":"Still the best tasting value pizza anywhere in town. You may find a few that may taste a little better now and then but for an $8.99 one topping large, nobody comes close when you combine value and taste."}
{"text":"Love the food can't go wrong.  But their service is horrible they don't attend you.  They have you on wait unless you demand it and ask for them on the counter."}
{"text":"Their double bacon cheeseburger is crazy amazing! It's huge and can be shared!!!! They always forget the ketchup mustard and mayo despite the fact I call every time and type it on the online order form. The burger comes with fries, the fries are different every time. 
I'm a salad person and their salads are fresh, huge, and full of quality ingredients! 
The double bacon cheeseburger and the large house salad along with an appetizer, has become my usual Saturday night after work treat. It's honestly so much food It's enough to keep me away from the grocery store on my 3 day weekends! 

I gave them 4 stars because they always forget the condiments, every time I call their staff is rude ( that's why I order online) they cross contaminate their fryer! The fries always taste fishy and they serve fried calamari. As a general rule, they should have 2 fryers, one for fish and meat, one for veggies and cheese. I work on the strip at a high end resteraunt, that being said I tip 15% on delivery and the delivery guy has an attitude every time. But the hours they are open are convenient and the salads and bacon cheeseburger can't be beat at 2:00 AM"}
{"text":"The slices are small, but I'm willing to fork over three bucks for two slices of plain cheese.  The pizzas are on the doughy side--not too doughy, but I personally prefer a little more crispness.  And since I already sound like Goldilocks in this review, I'll also say that I think the cheese is a little bit too salty, but just by a tiny margin.  

I often pass by this place on my way home, so I'm sure I'll keep coming back.  It does the trick when I get pizza cravings.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to head to Napoli if I wasn't already in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Les pizzas les moins bonnes que j'ai jamais goûté ! Même des surgelées aurait fait l'affaire. Une pâte molle et humide et une sauce presque inexistante, bref, je ne conseille PAS DU TOUT !"}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials.  My favorite is the chicken wings.  You get so much food for reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The pizza is perfection, and the Greek salad with feta along with the great music is a party in your mouth.  My husband and I will actually crave this place. Since its open 24 hrs we can enjoy anytime."}
{"text":"The best homemade pizza in Vegas.  It's an open and airy restaurant, family oriented, and the waitresses are super nice.  Their garlic balls are amazing... made with  soft dough & swimming in herbed garlic butter sauce.  I have St wish the bathrooms were more convenient and they had handicapped parking closer to front door."}
{"text":"The best thing here are the garlic balls. Pizza was boring and not at all New York style. If you have to eat here take it to go. The service is horrible and you really don't wanna use the bathroom that is in a scary alley full of what looks like sewage."}
{"text":"This is my favorite delivery pizza in town. Pricey but worth it. We get the gigantic one and eat around the edges then save the middle to re-bake the next day & I swear it gets even better. The garlic balls, fried ravioli, and chili cheese fries are all good appetizers. Baked ziti pasta dish is delicious. 
You'll feel like the anchor on a war ship when you're done eating but my god it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love getting their take out special of 1 topping pizza at about $8. Also love their wings here. Everything we've had was usually take out. They're always polite over the phone and they have our number saved I guess because they have our name when we call. They let you know how long the food will take so you can pick it up. It's always fresh and hot when we get it. I see where the complaints come from because they get pretty busy on the weekends. Sometimes they say the wait for one pizza is 30 minutes. Anyway, we finally decided to eat at the place instead of taking out. We ordered 40 wings and the 30 inch pizza. They let you do different sauces for the wings and you can have different toppings for each quarter of the pizza. The wings here are huge and meaty! I love the honey BBQ. The pizza came out and it was HUGE!! We thought it would be fun having this giant pizza. There were 7 of us and we didn't get through half of the pizza and still had about 10 wings. I like the pizza here, they're never skimpy on toppings and it's always super cheesy. Our server for the night was a very nice guy who was always checking on us, constantly refilling our drinks, and bringing us more ranch lol it was a fun and great experience. It was really cheap too!"}
{"text":"First and most definitely my last time here. The absolute worst. The pizza would've tasted okay if the service wasn't trash. Not to mention, their bathrooms looked like a scene off of the Texas chainsaw massacre. I knew I should've went to the peter piper pizza right in front of this joint. This place is ass."}
{"text":"Awesome place, cheesy curly fries are HEAVEN 
I ordered takeout 45 Mins before close, they had it ready for me in 20. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Delivery service is horrible!! We order from here and the order took an 1.5hrs and all of the food was cold!  If you want hot food delivered on time, order somewhere else"}
{"text":"I've been living in Las Vegas for a little over three years, but am originally from NYC (born and bred). I had tried to find pizza that I liked out here and had no luck. Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc. are what they are, but it isn't \"real\" pizza. The independent pizzerias in my neighborhood are crap too; I had given up on finding the perfect pie and began focusing on all the other good food out here (In-n-Out, anyone?) that I couldn't get back East. 

One day a coworker bought lunch for the office. Lo and behold, the perfect sausage (real, Italian sausage in slices, not that crumbled garbage) and mushroom NY-style pie! I found out it came from Napoli's and have been hooked ever since. 

Take it from a real, live NYC pizza snob--this is the best you will find in Las Vegas. It isn't perfect, but if you've lived here long enough, you've probably forgotten what good pizza tastes like anyway. Give it a shot; go pick up a 16\" pepperoni for just $7.99. The best part is that they recently opened a third store on Nellis, right near me. This is important; now I don't have to drive all the way to the West side and get home with a lukewarm pizza. Score! 

Napoli's has an extensive menu. I have not tried even a fraction of their offerings, but aside from their delicious pizza, they have great eggplant parm and amazing, fresh-made cannoli (they make them to order--no soggy shell). I could live with or without their chicken fingers, but they're not half bad. They make a damn good Stromboli too. The pizza is definitely the star of the show, but it's worth checking out some of their other offerings if you're in the mood for something different. You probably won't be disappointed either way."}
{"text":"Greate dine in experience
 fantastic 30 inch pizza with cold beer was awesome
I love this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"1hour and 40 min delivery at 8pm.... Are you kidding me??? This food was so disgusting. The fries were so sad and soggy..... How the hell do you mess up fries?! The chicken fingers were watery and mushy... I just threw out everything at grabbed Thai food. The pizza was so soggy it was inedible... How do you mess up a pepperoni pizza LMFAO. Ugh. Worst place everrrrr"}
{"text":"Never order online through Yelp. Order through the phone. It takes FOREVEERRRR doing it this way. Food it great but delivery is averaging 1 1/2."}
{"text":"Took 25 minutes for a medium half cheese/half pepperoni pizza when no one was in the restaurant. They chose to answer the phones before helping someone standing in front of them. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! We had ordered the meat lovers 30\", took four people three days to eat it! Was awesome!! Definitely do it again."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time ordering from Napoli's pizza.  We ordered Mozz Sticks, Eggplant Parm Sandwich w/ Fries, and Chocolate Cake.  

Pros - It WAS Super Bowl Sunday and we still received our order in under an hour.

Cons - everything else.  Even though my order was delivered within an hour, it tasted like it had probably been done a good 45mins before I got it (I live no more than 15mins away).  The Mozz sticks were solid...like they were cooked and sat for so long they got cold and were just solid sticks of cheese covered in breading.  When I ordered the Eggplant Parm Sandwich I asked them to add Ricotta cheese, I didn't see or taste any.  While the sauce was good, there wasn't nearly enough of it.  There was no sauce on the bread, so the eggplant was very dry, only a thin layer of sauce on top.  In addition to that, the eggplant wasn't cooked very well, I couldn't chew through most of it.  Then the chocolate cake - it was terrible.  It was dry and just didn't taste very good.

Like I said, my FIRST AND LAST time ordering from this pizzeria."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and they are usually pretty good but tonight was terrible! Pizza was cold and soggy , they got my wings wrong and the wait was way too long plus the employees were very rude when I asked how long it was going to be! She said we are busy , what do you expect ! Wow , I kinda expected good food ?!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a Sicilian pie from Napoli. My advice is to avoid it. You're better off with a regular pie. I also discovered if you want it to be a good pie, you need to order it slightly well or well. I don't know if it's the ovens Napoli uses or the crappy dough, but ordering it Well makes it better. Traditional pizza dough in a traditional brick oven doesn't need to be ordered well to be good, but this pizza does. When you order their pizza regular, the crust is mush and the bottom of the slice is white as can be. For the uninformed, pizza is supposed to be golden brown to brown on the bottom. Anything less and it's undercooked or practically raw. I kinda find it ridiculous that so many pizzerias find that concept so difficult. Usually, inferior Conveyor Air Ovens are the culprit. They may cook a pizza quicker, but they will never compare to a brick oven. Hope this helps some of you.  After a few more times ordering, I still in good conscience can only rate this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have had in a long time. Bbq pizza was great and the garlic balls are a great deal for the price!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars if it weren't for the fact that it takes an hour and 40 minutes to get my food delivered. And they quoted me an hour and 15 minutes for delivery love the stromboli and their cannolis are definitely the best cannolis in Las Vegas the food is well worth it pricey but well worth it you just have to wait forever for it but I can't complain i've ordered from them enough times to know that it always takes a long time to get my food delivered."}
{"text":"So it's Friday night in Vegas beginning of a holiday weekend.. I'm to tired to start the party weekend of cooking. I call at 6:30pm and order the 30' inch pizza for my nephews birthday. I asked them to write his name they said sure. Let me know pizza would be here in an hour... So excited can't wait to eat... Thanks for the birthday save...."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite Vegas pizza for years! Always awesome and we've always gotten a high quality delicious pizza from them! The staff has always been friendly and a bit quirky. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I just stumbled upon this place. I didn't research it before hand at all. The menu had a large selection. Since it was lunch, they were not serving the entire menu. I had the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. It was good, but nothing fantastic."}
{"text":"Good pizza. A little soggy on the crust. Got one with spinach and it was frozen spinach they used, I expected fresher ingredients. Bathroom was not the cleanest."}
{"text":"Love this authentic Italian pizzeria!! I have been here so many times and have always been warmly welcomed. The owners are Italian, not sure which region they are from however they are warm and hospitable when they welcome you. The happy hour Malbec is a delicious blend and their pizzas are delish! If you love brick oven style pizza and NUTELLA and amazing prosciutto, this is the place for you. Amazing arugula salad as well, love love love! 5 star view as well of the park at Town Square, and super romantic at night. My husband looks stunning underneath their patio lights  so do my friends!!! Great spot."}
{"text":"This place is open late- maybe even 24 hours.  I thought its location was a little out of place but who cares, when you're hungry- you're HUNGRY! 

I stumbled in about 2:30 a.m with some friends. The services was slow, but the food was very very good! and that wasn't just the hungry drunk talkin. The menu has a wide selection- typical for a pizza joint but enough to fulfill whatever midnight craving you're having. We had a SUPREME PIZZA which was delicious. 

What I liked most about this place aside from the food was how thorough the staff was. Each delivery was checked individually to ensure the order was correct, more that enough sauce, napkins, utensils were provided in each bag."}
{"text":"OK, I've been ordering regularly from Napoli for a few years now, and it's about time everyone knew about this place. 

Starting with the pizza...quite good, not great. Maybe a 7 out of 10, but well worth the carryout special price of $7.99 for a large 1-topping. Fed 3 generations with 3 of them last night for just a shade over $25.

So why should you go here? Allow me to continue...

I work in a local hospital. We have a pizzeria a block away, and we order lunch from this place, about 1.5 miles away. They have a ton of lunch specials at $7.99 (M-F 9am-3pm) that blow away anyone else's alleged specials. In particular: a hot pastrami and cheese hoagie with lots of both and dee-licious! And did I mention a ton of fries and a drink as well? Don't want a sandwich? They have 7 different HUGE salads in their specials. My favorite is the blackened chicken. I like the vinaigrette dressing with it.

Now, for the best part...the WINGS! I'm from the east coast and am very particular about my chicken wings. My opinion: this is the only place in town that gets it right! Huge wings, not those little pigeon wings most places serve. My choice is the hot, and they're perfect! Best combo of fire and flavor I've had since coming out west. We split a half-bucket (20 wings), add fries for a buck, and it comes to $14.99! Best wing deal in town! Look, you wanna split a pitcher and watch 6 games at once in a crowded bar, by all means go to BW3. You want wings, you get them here!

Small place, limited seating (at least at the Sahara/Decatur store), pretty much like a classic small family operation. And a correction to a previous review: they're not Russian, they're from Moldova.

To sum up: GO, GO, GO!!!"}
{"text":"Es muy buena la comida ,pero sus empleados son pésimos ,de esa forma no disfrutamos su comida !"}
{"text":"Good gluten free pizza.  Good crust and plenty of toppings.  I will order again."}
{"text":"My first meal in Squirrel Hill while looking for an apartment (I'm moving from out of town) was at Napoli Pizzeria.  When I walked in there were several EMTs by the door, so I figured the food would be good.  What EMT would go to a bad pizza place?  

At the entrance to the left is the counter with some of the pies waiting to be heated back up in the oven and to the right several coolers with drinks in bottles from beer to soda.  I ordered two slices of pepperoni, which came out pretty quickly.  

The staff was friendly and the pizza had just about the right ratio of crust to cheese to sauce.  It was greasy, but not too greasy (read just the way I like it).  On a cold day, it was the perfect hot thing for lunch and wasn't too pricey either."}
{"text":"Excellent as usual, great timing on delivery and easy ordering service my guests were very happy with the pizza and Parmesan garlic fingers"}
{"text":"I love Napoli's. Oh how I love it! I love it so much that when my flight lands from St. Louis (I go to college in MO), I already have my mum (or dad or whoever is the airport slave of the day) call in my order in the car! I love how thin the crust is and how cheesy the pizza is and how mild the sauce is. It's not too acidic or too sweet. It's JUST RIGHT. Also I may be a little biased as I love wet pizza and lots of cheese. :D The closest thing I can get to this place in STL is The Good Pie. And it's more traditional Neapolitan pizza than Napoli's is.... but damn, Napoli's is like a Neapolitan pizza had sex with a normal NY style pizza and then YUM sprang forth. Yeah, I love this place, that's probably an understatement. I also love the fact that you can get beer from the case behind you with your pizza...because PA is such a booze-Nazi state. :x"}
{"text":"Gave it a few tries before posting.  As a true pizza connoisseur, go elsewhere.  The dough is stretched nicely but something must be wrong With their oven as they do the pizzas, subs, everything on trays so you don't get the flavor of a seasoned over.  Tough dough.  Severely overpriced.  Walk down to Mineos."}
{"text":"Absolute trash...and the night manager or so she claims to be was rude and arrogent. I placed a order on eat24 and ordered the philly bomb sandwich along with a small pizza and another sandwich...i SPICIFICALLY ordered the philly bomb because according to the description ON eat24 it says it comes with MEAT CHEESE AND MUSHROOMS! i get the sandwich and open the box to see its loaded with 10lbs of shit peppers and onions which i do NOT eat...when i called to tell them this was not what i ordered i was told my order was correct and thats how the sandwich comes...then AFTER repeating multiple times thats not what was on the description i was basically called a liar. And the \"manager\"told me she was sure that it says it comes with all that shit and then didnt even look for herself! She would do NOTHING for me not replace the sandwich which is all i wanted she offered me a shit 10% off my next order ....SERIOUSLY! from one business owner to another you should be firing this lady for her horrible excuse of customer service. I will be sharing with every friend i have about my experience. And filing a complaing with eat24...sad to because i have a LONG history and MUCH money spent with this company....not anymore"}
{"text":"Super disappointed in service from both this restaurant and Yelps eat 24 app.  thankful I don't live in Vegas and won't ever go there again. Or use the ordering off of this app ever again"}
{"text":"I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. They seem to only be in business for takeout or delivery orders. The service was nonexistent. While the food was okay, they were overpriced. $35.00 for a large pizza? Save your time and money, don't bother with Napoli Pizzeria on West Sahara."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp with artichoke salad and got only 4 shrimp and rotten avocado. It might be the size of a quarter the edible avocado.  For $11.99 You would think that they would check their avocados to make sure that they are not rotten or not ripe. I usually get this sale because it's filling and very delicious. But the last few times I have gotten this salad it has been sub par. Bad avocados and barely any shrimp. To Victor if you read my review and read the picture, it says \"I HAD TO CUT THE SHRIMP TO MAKE IT BE MORE\" Also I did not receive half an avocado as you claim!!! If you look at the picture I received maybe 3 small slices that were rotten. I took the salad apart and that was the only avocado in there. This isn't the first time I have ordered this salad and it isn't the first time I have received it with rotten avocado!!!!!!! If I could I would not give any stars at all!!!!!! Never ordering from you again!!!!"}
{"text":"We had pizza and fries delivered for lunch, and really liked the food. The cheese pizza is not too greasy/cheesy. There wasn't anything fancy about the fries, but still tasted fine.
The only negative was the fact that it took one hour for the food to be delivered. We'll be trying their 30 inch pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Napoli's, you guys really came through for us for our  party. After reading lots of reviews we were very hesitant about ordering for a  party since,  we'd never order from them before for a  party but, we dine in sometimes and we love Napoli's pizza we decided to order and take a risk i'm glad we did it was ready on time and hot. Thank you."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night for delivery, and all in all it was not a great experience. Besides the food being mediocre, their customer service could really use some work. The woman who took my order over the phone was not helpful, difficult to understand as well as having a hard time understanding me, and to be honest she was kind of rude. We ordered a Chicken Parm sub and a Chicken Cacciatore dinner. She said our order wouldn't be here for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, which is absurd since their menu states \"fast delivery.\" We almost cancelled but decided to give them a try anyway. Well the delivery man had the most difficult time EVER finding my apartment, I understand that complexes can be confusing, but he called me multiple times and I kept telling him to just go back to the front and I would direct him to my apartment but he like refused to do that, I don't know if he couldn't understand me or what, he was difficult to understand as well. I put it on speaker and my boyfriend thought he heard him tell me to come meet him at the leasing office, lol. I'm pretty sure the whole point of paying extra for delivery is to have the food come to me. Anyway! When he finally arrived I handed him a tip and he didn't say thank you and told me he needed my credit card and ID, but I had already payed the woman with my card over the phone. So I got it and he took an IMPRINT of my card which is totally not ok! Anyway, our bill was much more than expected because we must have an old menu or something, the prices we were charged were way higher than the prices on the delivery menu. Boyfriend said his sub was ok, but I tried his fries and they were horrible, rubbery and we didn't even eat all of them. My chicken was pretty good although it was basically just chicken in a pool of marinara with pretty much NO veggies at all. Pasta was decent and garlic bread was horrible. I definitely don't think we'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! They have the most amazing food. I've tried everything from the salads to the wings (especially the mango habanero... Yum!!!) and never have I been disappointed. I'm actually always surprised how good the food is lol! Great place, great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious and consistent. Love their pizza, wings, cheese fries, lasagna!! The staff aren't so friendly but the food compensates for it."}
{"text":"Well... I left here thinking I was going to give them 2 stars due to the 30 minute wait. Once I took a bite of their delicious pizza there was no way I could give it 2 stars! YUM! And only $7.99 for a one topping pizzas. Great value! I wasn't expecting it to even be half as good. There was a family in there and the father mentioned to someone in there that his kids loved Napolis. I now know why... And you know what... The 30 wait wasn't so bad being that it was a Saturday night and I could understand why they would be busy."}

20 min taking and order and failed
Never again 
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbbbbbbb"}
{"text":"So they are open til 3am tonight. I wanted a meatball sandwich. I live 40 minutes away. So I called in my order. She said it would be ready in 25. The owner is there and I told him I was here to pick up my order can you also add dessert. He threw the strawberries in for free for Valentine's Day. He's a nice guy. The restraint is nice no doubt. But when you get home there's no meatballs in your sausage sandwich and French fries are soggy, somethings wrong!!!!.  I once again took everything home didn't check it there because they had everything ready.so I took it all the way back. They did a good job as you can tell in the other photo. The only complaint is wanna say is, the bread was still partially hard and partially soggy. I vented the box on the way home as the cook suggested so it wouldnt get soggy but it still did. The taste of the food was okay, truthfully not worth the $8.99.  The desserts were the best over all. I won't be back though!!! Whoever goes good luck"}
{"text":"So after some of the bad reviews I had to say. They hit the mark for me and the family. My daughter loves the size of the box coming threw the door but then two more to fallow. The food is hot and fresh called at 1 and asked to be here at 5. The delivery guy got here at 502. I'm impressed and always taste amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from our work place at the strip and took 2 and a half hours to deliver HORRIBLE delivery service we called and they said sorry for the delay"}
{"text":"I order here all the time and I'm never disappointed. They have amazing chicken fingers with tons of flavors; they come with the best fries ever and of course they have delicious pizza! I tried the blackened chicken salad tonight and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My girl and I like to come here for dinner every other week or so. Really great pizza and wings. Garlic balls are good as well."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place! I've always been very happy with the food I've ordered. Pizza, chicken fingers, fries... YOU NAME IT. 

I've recently been on a pasta kick from Napoli's and it's delish! The pasta is definitely a great secret to know about."}
{"text":"We went in for salads and pizza and we will def return again. We ordered a Caesar salad and a small pizza. The salad was perfect for us hungry people and the pizza was very tasty and not dry at all.  There was a very open feel to the place. There are TV's and windows that make the place feel overly spacious. 
Someone came in for a carry out while we were eating. They picked up their pizza, which was the biggest pizza I've ever seen. It looked like the guy could barely fit it through the door."}
{"text":"Italian!  Oh how we love Italian food.  Especially good Italian food!
So my girlfriend and I spotted this restaurant on our first or second day in Montreal.  We ended up having Italian two meals in a row at different restaurants, so we waited on this one until toward the end of our trip.  We finished off our trip with a pleasantly full tummy! :)

So we arrived at Napoli a little early, about 5pm.  The front half of the restaurant was almost full, and they sat us at the last table in the front, which was near the front window.  We were both very cold, so we politely asked to be moved to the back, which they did with no problem.  We were the first to sit in the back area and were much warmer.

The menu was extensive!  So many options to choose from.... we took quite a long while deciding what to have - the waiter was not bothered by this and told us there was a lot on the menu and to take our time.  We started with a half bottle of the Orvieto Classico, which is a great light white wine!  My girlfriend had the dinner formula (soup or salad and plate combined).  She had the chicken cream soup and the Penne Salmon.  I chose the Bruschetta appetizer to arrive with her soup, and for my main dish, the Meat & Pepperoni Lasagna.  Both our meals were amazing!  She said that was some of the best Penne Salmon she's every had (and she has it almost every time she sees it on the menu somewhere!)

After the meal, we decided on sharing a delicious Tiramisu, which is served in a large martini glass.  We also had an espresso for my girlfriend and a latte for me.  We paid with a credit card, and it's important to know that a gratuity was automatically added to the bill (15%-18%, I can't remember).  We left two dollars more as well, as we had excellent food and amazing service!  The servers were all very pleasant and my water was refilled quickly (something I pay close attention to).  All-in-all a lovely meal!  I hope to come back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"La atención al cliente es magnífica es un lugar muy agradable para convivir con tu familia es muy bonito tod"}
{"text":"I've had a hard time finding a slice of pizza that doesn't dissolve under the weight of its own cheese and grease since moving to Pittsburgh but I finally lucked out with the white pizza from Napoli Pizzeria in Squirrel Hill. The crust isn't too thick but is crisp enough to keep its shape and toppings, the blend of olive oil, garlic and spices makes me forget about red sauce entirely, and even though it's perfectly delicious with just a cheese topping, nearly any of the other 20 topping choices would make for a great meal, too. The only thing that would make it better is if goat cheese was on the menu. 

I wouldn't recommend eating in, though. The dining area is cramped and loud and the counter set-up makes it difficult to get to. Besides, this is one of the few pizza places in Squirrel Hill that will actually deliver--so embrace your inner laziness and eat it on the couch."}
{"text":"There's only one reason to order from Napoli and that's their 30\" MONSTER pizza.  It is, without a doubt, the largest pizza I have ever seen.  The initial reactions from others partaking in this beast is worth the price alone.  We had a party of 6 and still had a ton of leftovers!

I ordered at 10am on a football Sunday.  Obviously a busy time for them so it took over an hour for it to arrive but no big deal.  I was very impressed that I could view the entire menu, make my order and pay for the pizza through the Yelp app via eat24 with such ease.  Delivery was the only way I could get this pizza home unless I wanted to clean out my car trunk to make space or rent a U-haul anyways.  

We ordered the supreme which had all the usual suspects for toppings.  I honestly thought the crust wasn't going to be very good due to the size but it was alright.  Someone taking a blindfold test between this and Metro would probably say Metro was better but it's all about the show with this \"pie\"."}
{"text":"Good amount of food given for the prices they charge.  Their pizzas are yummy and I LOVE their wing!"}
{"text":"Best fingers and wings and they open later for all u late night bar hoppers fresh and fast food"}
{"text":"love piza here , expecailly the gian 30\" . so yummy. the staffs are friendly , they always help me carry the gian pizza to my car . i could it pizza everyday if my family like it."}
{"text":"Rating is on good alone, portions and taste are great. The waitresses are horrible very little attention paid to patrons eating in."}
{"text":"If there was a way to choose no stars I would. I placed an order at 7:30 received an email saying it would arrive in 30-45 minutes. So at 8:30 I was concerned and called ou to be told they have a third party ordering on there website that routed my order to this location. Mind you I live on charleston and nellis. There is a napolis 5-10 min down the road. Now I wasn't asking for any compensation but when the woman on the phone had additude and said not my problem I requested her manager who also said not my problem. He stated this was my pizza.com has problems and nothing he can do but either send the order out and wait another 20-30 min or cancel the order and have the store by me make it. I said send it then. The manager was completely rude and unhelpful. And I received $50 worth of food soggy and less than desirable. When the delivery driver got here and asked how I was I said mad and he said not my fault. I don't think I will ever order again. Which sucks cause I've been ordering from napoli's for years. Smh."}
{"text":"Wow one of the nicest pizzeria in town glad found this guys nice clean and neat little bit wait time but worth the waiting time will come back again definitely"}
{"text":"DO NOT EXPECT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE (they never smile and always rush you and can be forgetful with drinks) ... 

BUT what they lack in service they make up for in DELICIOUS FOOD. Expect long waits. Order ahead... Make them repeat your order, pick up or dine in, but not delivery. I've going for years and only once was I given a smile at the Decatur and Sahara location.  She made our day and got a nice Tip :)"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the fingers ... Good prices
Dine in is a great option 
Fast service and always good specials"}
{"text":"Three words- HUGEST. PIZZA. EVER. My friends and I always get the HUGE supreme pizza whenever we're in Vegas. So yummy and you can't beat the price for the size."}
{"text":"Food is garbage..have ordered from them twice will never again. Whoever their cook is needs to learn how to use a deep fryer..food was so over cooked..wings fingers and jalapeño poppers and the pizza was a greasy soggy mess. Called them back and made them come pick their garbage up and got my money back."}
{"text":"Food is good but plan on being patient.  Service is bad and I don't blame the staff they are taking phone orders and waiting tables.  I do wonder what the 5. Guys in the corner or doing when I wait 15 min for a glass of wine and 20 for my check"}
{"text":"This place has such mixed reviews.  They seem to have some consistency and customer service issues.  My experience was pretty indicative of that.  We walked in late afternoon on a Friday.  They weren't too busy.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  The girl who took our order was nice.  Told her about my allergies and ordered a tuna avocado sandwich on wheat bread (pending there were no nuts or seeds in it) with a side salad. Subbed out the chicken on our Delux pizza for jalapenos instead.  She checked with the kitchen about the wheat bread and said it had oats. I said oats are fine so we will get the wheat bread.

Side salad came out first.  It was fresh and the house vinaigrette is delicious. After that is when the problems started.

Sandwich came out next.  On a WHITE roll. The guy who brought it out offered to take it back but no biggie, we will eat it as is. 

Pizza was delivered to the table. Covered in chicken. NO jalapenos. Sigh. Am I taking crazy pills? Was she just pretending to write down our order the whole time? 

Overall, the food was fresh and delicious so I can't really complain there. The young lady who messed up our order never came back to the table, but the guy who served us the rest of the time was super attentive. Based on my experience and after reading some of these negative reviews, I think they just need to train their staff a little better."}
{"text":"Again, if it wasn't clear from my last review, this is one of the best pizza places in Vegas, and with their $8.99 pick-up special - you can't go wrong. 
If you don't know their pizza, I would highly recommend you to try it. I didn't try other food, so my recommendation is for their pizza :)"}
{"text":"This is a charcoal chard calzone, I heard food is good here but, please look at this picture, calzone supposed to be nice and golden crust, not like hard solid sealed tight armoured empanada, STINGY on the toppings, I can tell you, before God, there was none, NOT EVEN A SIGLE TINY PARTICLE of MEAT, we order ham and pepperoni, but, ate one quarter of the calzone and I got tired of cheese, a kilo of cheese inside, brócoli soup was ok, but cook scratched the bottom, which every cook knows they shouldn't, OMG 
30 DLLS for calzone, soup and coke, no way, come on, attencione whit the portions fratelo, we may not come back, music was loud, server was superb, Monday June 12, sorry man, needs attention 
Thank you"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service, but-a good product. We just ordered a few min ago just because we decided to give them another chance. The same rude lady answered and when I asked questions, she answers super fast and as if shes ANNOYED with her customer. She may be using please but it sounds insincere and no matter what super annoyed. My husband and I are afraid to order just so we avoid the attitude. We are going to look else where from now on. Last order placed was today and thank God I don't have to ever annoy her again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE Customer Service. I placed a late-night order. The woman on the phone allegedly said \"45 minutes\", but I heard \"25 minutes\". I would take the blame for this if I hadn't repeated back to her twice to confirm that she said \"25 minutes\". So an hour after we place the order, the food shows up. Everyone was asleep, so it went straight to the fridge. The next morning we discover that they didn't even provide the food we ordered (somehow \"Turkey Club with no tomato\" sounds like \"Bruschetta\"?!). After complaining and having the customer service person not only interrupt me, but shout OVER me on the phone, they send the driver to pick up the incorrect order and credit my account. We had to wait 30 minutes to check out for the driver to arrive because he demanded that we not leave it at the door for him. Then they don't even credit my account. What a disaster! I will NEVER even consider ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for groups, as the serving sizes are ample. I was greeted upon entering...not with an obligatory greeting where they don't even look up...but REALLY greeted. Service and food were great!  Their delivery service is equally impressive. Good pizza and great crispy buffalo chicken salad (may want to stay with the mild sauce or less if you are sensitive to spicy food). Overall...a great experience."}
{"text":"Great place I was there last night at 1 am with my wife and we ordered pizza and wings it was the best I had in Las Vegas....GOOD JOB GUYS!!!"}
{"text":"I am always on the look out for some great pizza.  I actually used Yelp to help me find pizza in the area I was in.  This was not a disappointment.  Their pizza is delicious and priced well. The restaurant is clean and tidy.  I can't wait to visit again and try out some of their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"We ordered the the \"Giant\" size supreme pizza and had it delivered to the lobby at Vdara. The impressive size sure turned heads as we were carrying the behemoth through the lobby lol!

The pizza was huge and tasted awesome! Crust was great, lots of great quality toppings. 

Their wings were so good too!

A pretty fair deal compared to other pizzerias that  deliver at 2am on the strip. $36 for a giant 30 inch loaded pizza."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza! The garlic knots and Greek pizza were quite impressive.... I also loved the grape leaves!"}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping by anytime my Mom and I come to visit Montreal! The owner always welcomes us and I enjoy our server Ben! The spaghetti w sauce tastes so fresh and authentic! I had the minestrone soup today for the first time and it was delicious.  The portions are good at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before, but the service at this place is so offensive that I feel that a review is warranted.  I planned a lunch delivery for our monthly staff luncheon, and the food did not arrive in time for the meeting.   In fact, the order was 45 minutes late.  The lady on the phone who took the order was downright rude, with a \"take it or leave it\" attitude.  Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.  I gave this place 2 stars because the food is actually fresh and tasty.  But the service SUCKS."}
{"text":"It's actually sort of painful to have to do this because I like the pizza here, it was pretty decent overall.  They have really good specials and pricing on everything but I recently ate here and got food poisoning :( 
I usually order the pick up special, large pizza.  I ordered one a few days ago and everything was fine as usual except I woke up in the middle of the night with some of the worst stomach cramps I've ever had and proceeded to spend the next few hours in and out of the bathroom.  I don't have to go into detail, it was a mild case of food poisoning. I don't like to point fingers and throw the term \"food poisoning\" around lightly, however it had to have come from the pizza I ordered.  It was the only thing I had eaten that evening.  I remember someone pointing out to me a few months ago that they thought they saw this pizza place on an episode of \"Dirty Dining\" on one of the news channels. Sucks because this place was convenient and the pizza was good, but not good enough to suffer the consequences of contamination."}
{"text":"Just made a delivery order was told that it would be here in 45 minutes. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes! The fries are soggy!!! The Philly cheesesteak that I ordered there's a lump of cheese on one side of the sandwich NOT evenly distributed. Not happy with my order pretty much lost my appetite after waiting so long and getting less than average food!"}
{"text":"I recently did a pizza crawl through squirrel hill with a friend, where we hit every single one of squirrel hill's 7 pizzerias, and got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each one in a row!  Napoli's had the best pepporoni hands down, and in our opinion the 2nd best pizza over all next to mineos.  Napoli's pizza's a bit greasy, but very good over all, fast, cheap, and has the most crispy and flavorful pepperoni of any pizzeria in squirrel hill.  A must for any pepperoni lovers!"}
{"text":"Used to be my fav pizza place in town; quality of ingredients, customer service and changing their sandwiches have me changing my mind. They changed their sausage and pepper sandwich to slices of sausage vs the correct way with sausage links. Not what I used to get here... was my fav place in town for this sandwich but sadly I'll have to find a new place for it now."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Competing against the two other anchoring pizza joints on Murray Ave, Napoli's by far wins. They provide a richer cheese and more of it on top of an actual doughy and crispy crust. Both of Napoli's competition fall short with too much grease and a plastic tasting crust, where it can be replicated with frozen pizza.  

In contrast, Napoli's Pizza provides an authentic red or white pizza with generous toppings from crispy pepperoni, rich bacon, hearty mushrooms, juicy spinach, to spicy banana peppers.

Aesthetically, Napoli's is a pizza joint with the same green booths one would expect to find in a \"little Italy,\" creating a small, friendly and cozy familiarity between the pizza makers and customers. At lunch, this place is packed with customers buying pizza by the slice, ordering fried zucchini, and munching on toasted hoagies. 

If you're not up for sitting-in, delivery is always a quick and available option. The pizza is always delivered pipping hot and fast."}
{"text":"I ordered from here got 2 bacon cheese burgers  and the order was 30 minutes late and its not even 10 minutes from my house gave the driver money and he had no change this is not professional and should not have to deal with the inconvenience why have a ETA and not make it on time thats the whole point of a eta and time of drop off."}
{"text":"Ugh! I cannot get enough of their pizza! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water lol.. 

I had the pleasure of trying their delicious pizza years back. They used to cater at my college events. I mean c'mon they are known for their 30\" pizza! More than enough to go around and reasonably priced.

You can dine in, order take out or have it delivered. It's not a huge establishment but it's spacious and always clean. They are always courteous and they provide great customer service. They have a wide selection and they have a GLUTEN FREE menu as well.
When you order delivery they are exact with the time! It's great that they don't take as long as other places. The owners/workers actually care!

You must try their bone in wings! I'm not sure how they do it, but they are delicious! Right amount of sauce, spicy but not too spicy, just right. Let's not forget about their garlic balls, mmm.. which you can get for free if you check in!

They have a carry out special, a one topping 16 inch for 8.99, it's actually cheaper than getting a small. It's available at all three locations.

The location is very convenient, it's in a small shopping plaza. If you're out and about near this area and you're hungry.. definitely stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"This is a spot we stop off and get our pizza fix when we are in Vegas. About 1-2 miles from the vegas strip, great location! Garlic balls were pretty damn good, check-in on here and they give em' to you on the House. Pizza was a little cold, overall good food, food did take a while to come out but overall we were satisfied"}
{"text":"I had always seen their commercials and most of the reviews on here said they were fantastic. I was on this website tonight before I decided to order. I read a couple reviews that said their crust was fabulous and since I am big in to crust, I decided to order. I got the Specialty Pizza with olives, pepperoni, bacon and feta cheese. 
Despite all the reviews I read earlier, the staff was nothing but friendly. They weren't overly friendly but they weren't rude, either. 
The delivery did take an hour, the pizza is pretty big (18\") but I have seriously had better. Honestly, I would have rather ordered papa johns and would have paid less for better quality AND it would have come to my place a lot faster. I will not be ordering from them again. It tastes just like my local greasy pizza bar down the street from me. They're nothing special, at all."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town! Good food and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Napoli's has been our family's pizza joint my entire life. The pizza is especially delicious when you eat it in the restaurant. I'm 23 now and I still haven't found a pizza place that I like as much. The way it smells when it comes out of the oven is heavenly, and every piece is delectable. The pizza has a tasty, moist crust, and you can't beat the pepperoni."}
{"text":"First of all, this place left a menu in OUR mailbox...so it was perfect, we had a flight leaving at 6am and still have a ton of stuff to do to get ready for our flight.... So we gave Napoli a shot....TWO hours later and our pizza was still not delivered. We called to cxl an to say that was ridiculous and the girl just offers a discount and says that they are busy! Really? I have never waited 2 hours for ANY pizza. So did it take 2 hrs to actually get the pizza cooked or has it been sitting under a heat lamp for two hrs waiting for a delivery person? Don't solicit or leave your flyer at or even near my home if you can't deliver a flipping pizza in the proper amount of time.  I would never ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"The wings are pure heaven. I love this place! And the chili cheese fries are to die for"}
{"text":"Tried ordering a pizza online and my address wasn't considered valid so I couldn't place the order. Okay cool. So, I called up the Nellis location and was put on hold for 15 minutes. Not cool. The best part? They never even picked up so I never actually got a chance to place an order. I just stayed on the line until I was done placing my order for Pizza Hut instead. So not cool. Pizza's good, place is clean, service is the worst."}
{"text":"I placed an order for an office party on a Friday. I didn't have a chance to get anything prepared for the party, so when I placed the order, I asked of they could bring us plates. The delivery was on time, the driver was friendly, and there were plates in the bag, along with napkins and the crushed pepper. That's not all... About 10 minutes later, the delivery driver shows back up, unexpectedly, with a package of foam plates, which (seemed) he had just bought himself! Now that's what I call customer service!! Going out of their way to fulfill a customer request..... I will definitely be ordering from Napoli's on Decatur again!! Thanks so much."}
{"text":"My mom wanted some Italian food and we were close so I took her here. Wow big mistake I told her not to order the veal at a pizza spot. Smh it looked like pig sloop it did not look or Taste like veal. I got the chicken sandwich there was so much mayo on it I could not eat it please stick to pizza and wings here that's all it's good for"}
{"text":"Good pizza good fresh salads. They use really good cheese and fresh ingredients on pizzas. They have good prices you won't be disappointed, except if it gets busy the service gets a little bad. But not bad enough to discourage anyone from going there."}
{"text":"i am a regular at this location & am treated as such.. everytime i call or come
in i am greeted as such.. i order the same blackened chicked salad EVERY single
time & I definitely recommend it.. vinegarette dressing is awesome.. i just love the staff & food.! i've never had any bad experiences.. i recommend the blackened chicken salad.!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service.  I stood at the counter trying to pay for my pizza and finally walked out when they wouldn't help me."}
{"text":"Love this place can't help but come here even tho I live on Durango and 95 . Best pizza for the price fore sure hands down . Carry out spcl is just 8 bucks for large one topping pizza"}
{"text":"the albatross in the form of a lady hanging around the front of the entrance coupled to the waiter who ended up serving our table should have been the giveaway not to go in. getting the menu and seeing 59315310 permutations of pizzas should have been the other giveaway. seriously, i watched someone finish reading one entire book of game of thrones while i was going through the menu.

after settling on a pizza, i had the pleasure of watching a real life soap opera unfold in front of me. we were conveniently seated right by the window where we could watch the whole event of the stalker female and the waiter bantering back and forth in what could only be the result of the end of a sour relationship. sigh. it was more bearable than staring at the decor of this place. i don't even know how to describe it.

at least the pizza was good. oh wait, wrong review. the pizza was, at best, mediocre. it was also ridiculously expensive for what you got. avoid this place. there are plenty better in the st. denis area."}
{"text":"Good food. Delivery on time. Double bacon burger was huge and the wings were good as well."}
