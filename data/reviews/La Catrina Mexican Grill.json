{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Restaurant  closed. No lights, no signs, door locked. Must be out of business."}
{"text":"This is where Senor Tequila at Piper Glen moved.  Lots of the same menu items.  Food's still great!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian , they have so many options to choose from which is wonderful. The veggie nachos are fantastic and the margarita was very fresh and tasty. The service is a bit spotty and I would say that is what they need to work on. The last two visits there they messed my order up. The manager did comp my meal which I appreciated but their inconsistency makes me want to stay Away."}
{"text":"I live the decor and the originality! The painting on the wall breathtaking! It's a family owned business they have wonderful service and the food and drinks are delicious! I love this new place"}
{"text":"Great meal.    Mexican favorites plus a slew of authentic family recipes.    This is on our list of regular family restaurants."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this restaurant, but found it just ok. I have been there 3 times, each time hoping that it only improved. The first visit, my food was served cold and the tea was bitter. I chalked that up to it just opening. The 2nd visit, my enchiladas did not have enough spice/sauce and no cheese! Thankfully, the food was served warm. This last visit, I ordered a taco salad only to discover that the chicken is very similar to canned chicken. The refried beans were watery and made my the salad shell soggy. Salsa served with chips is ok, but similar to some other Mexican places and not really good. 

While I'm no expert on Mexican food, I have lived in the southwest and have traveled in Mexico quite often. The food is just not up there in my opinion. Beautiful restaurant, great seating, nice lighting, friendly staff and owner, but bring a sweater. It's very very chilly in there. 

Overall, OK. Not 5 stars, but a good place to go if you want Mexican food in the Blakeney area."}
{"text":"Food portion is big. However the quality is so so. Overall atmosphere is slouchy. Need to find a better restaurant when I feel like having Mexican food."}
{"text":"Senior tequila has moved and food still outstanding. Favorite mexican restaurant  in charlotte under new name. Same owner, consistently great mexican/latin american food. Will be here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Decided to come here essentially because of being so close to home. Save yourself and drive the extra miles to get better service."}
{"text":"Gave this a try based on other Yelp reviews. You know how you read about a restaurant with mixed reviews, and you just hope that the reviewers with the bad reviews were really picky? Yeah, that's what I was hoping.

I'm here to say that the reviews weren't wrong; service is definitely lacking at La Catrina, and one of the reasons we likely won't return.

When we arrived around 6 for dinner, there were multiple tables on the right side of the restaurant shoved together, with a bunch of kids and adults who looked to have recently been to a swim meet. There were several booths in the area with kids and adults too. 

The person seating my husband and I bypassed several empty tables on the left side of the restaurant, and tried to seat us at a booth in between and right in the middle of all the kids and adults.

I've got nothing against kids, but why would you sit two adults who are just hoping to have a nice meal in the very center of tables with mostly kids when there are so many other tables available?

I asked that we move to a different area, so instead of putting us somewhere quieter, he just moved us to a booth on the other side of the same section. Noise level was pretty intense until the large groups left.

We tried to order beers on draft, but were informed draft beer was not available for some reason. So we ordered two bottled beers. It took 10+ minutes for us to get our beers. I was in full sight of the bar so I watched as our waiter didn't even try going to the bar to get our beers until roughly the 10 minute mark. 

When our beers were finally brought, my husband had been given the wrong one. The waiter was pouring out of the bottles into the glasses and my husband had to ask him to remove his hand from the label so he could confirm which beer it was. He'd ordered a darker beer and noticed the beer being poured was more of a light ale/lager style.

Our food wasn't memorable, but it was okay. Salsa was really watered down and runny.

There are so many better Mexican restaurants within a 5 minute drive, that I just can't imagine why we would ever return here again."}
{"text":"Total disappointment. A few weeks ago I went here with my cousin thought the service and food were great. Tonight I went for Cinco de Mayo at 8:30 it was packed like a mad house and my husband and I wanted to sit outside. We were willing to wait and understood that they were busy. My husband and I sat at the bar to wait. It took 15 minutes before someone finally served us. My husband asked for the tab and it took another 15 minutes before they tabbed us out because we were being seated. We waited almost 40 minutes to be seated, again busy, so we understood. What I am most upset about is how after we got seated 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes go by no one had come up to our table to provide chips or asked us if we had been helped. To offer points we had plenty of servers look at us and walk by. I mean I could have said excuse me to one of them, but it shouldn't be the customers job to ask for service at a restaurant. Super disappointed, so we left without any service or food."}
{"text":"Went there a couple weeks ago for the 1st time.  Food and service were good, so went back tonight.  Told a 20 minute wait for a table... Place was mobbed.  Friends of hostess come in, and she tells them \"don't worry, I'll get you in\".  Hostess then seats her friends ahead of many others waiting.  Another guest calls her out on it, and the hostess replies with \"oh...they had reservations\".  The other guest told the hostess she heard her tell them not to worry and she'd get them in.  The other guest complains to bartender and his reply was that he has nothing to do with the tables.  That was enough...after waiting 25 minutes and this nonsense....my family and I left and will never go back.  Don't know who owns this place, but with crap like that...good luck succeeding."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The place is gorgeous with great decor. Ordered Ropa Vieja and Quesadillas and both were just perfect....Love the sweet fried plantains!  You get plenty of food with each plate.  Will def go back!! Oh and kids eat free on Wednesday.  I agree, restaurants in this spot usually dont stay open for long but I sure hope La Catrina stays here for good!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to say that this place is very disappointing. The ambiance and quality of food is great! However the service is terrible terrible terrible!!! I was so excited to have a Mexican restaurant near my house. We have given it about 6-7 chances and each time the service has been worse. They are so unbelievably slow and it seems like it's the same two wait staff and never more....for inside and outside. 


Please fix this issue....all you need to do is hire more staff then you'll be awesome! I am not sure when but I will probably give it one more chance in a few months."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  The food was delicious.  Got the lunch specials and the fajitas were amazing and so was the super burrito! We had amazing margaritas and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food was beyond bland.  My husband's tacos which were supposed to be crunchy had been laid on top of his beans so the shells had turned to mush. He had to eat them with a fork. They had a sign hanging up saying that they are now open on Sunday's. If their business is struggling, we highly doubt that being closed on Sunday is the problem. It took forever to get our food. They brought some of our family's food ages before other people at the table. No one wanted to eat in front of those without food but we also didn't want our food getting cold. The server seemed like she would rather be anywhere else in the world but there. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Both food and service are excellent.  Menu has good options, both food and drinks.  All workers were smiling every time we've been here.  Very quickly became our go to Mexican place in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review. I've been twice. The first time was pretty good- not great but not terrible. However; my second visit there was just awful. It took forever for them to send a server over. And when he came he seemed very confused. And the food - when it finally arrived was just meh.  The beans and rice were cold.  The steak was over cooked and I could barely chew it. I sent it all back.  I received a very lack luster apology and the bill. I will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant on a recommendation. I live in the neighborhood and this is a neighborhood shopping center so we thought why not. My initial ambivalence to trying this restaurant was that the shopping center is just awful quality, poor design, residential quality exterior furnishings, planters, etc.....dreadfull place. No detail dryvit buildings. I could go on but I'm already boring you. When we arrived there were more people outside than in (one family inside) so I agreed with my wife that people equal atmosphere and we requested an exterior table. For the brief moment I was inside it looked like they spent some money and looked great. Again, this is not the restaurants fault but the exterior awnings, light fixtures, tables were all fading because the developer bought the cheapest thing they could find to go with the dryit building facades. Ok...back to the dining. The salsa and chips were good...seemed fresh. The waitress was efficient with no personality. Table felt dirty, the ground felt dirty. There were no tableware which she did not realize until the food arrived. She could not have had more than 2 tables to serve. I had the Enchilada Verdes (chicken) and from the first bite it was extremely salty. I am somewhat of a believer that you order it as you want it and then eat what you get so I don't complain much. I cannot remember ever not loving a mexican dish but here in front of me was the first. My wife had the Beef Chimichanga and after a couple bites she had the same thoughts. When the efficient waitress came by at the end of the meal with  a nice dessert treat I told her the meal was tasty but was extremely salty. We got a \"hmmmm\" from her and a questioning look and that was it. No, \"I'm sorry you did not enjoy it\". We heard the table next to us complain about the food also saying they had eaten there before and had the same dish several times but that it was not nearly as good as they were accustomed to. The waiter apologized at least. By the way saying the food was tasty was my way of being nice for I could not get past the salt to taste much else. I wish them much success but I cannot say we will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The guacamole and salsa were bland and the entrees were merely ok.  Service was not poor, but not great either.  I'd currently choose On the Border over this place.  I'm sorry to say that because I really wanted to prefer the family-owned restaurant over the chain."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  We eat here an average of once a week. The food is delicious and tastes fresh all the time. Oscar and his staff are always friendly and efficient. Definitely a winner and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, from the cheese and bean dip appetizer to my chimichanga entree. The portions were plentiful that my three friends and I all had to take part of our meals home. They also loved the Mexican Bulldogs, which I wish I had a sip of (but I'm pregnant). The service was timely and the chips were refilled without being asked which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Had high expectations but I doubt we'll be coming back.  I grew up in Los Angeles, CA.  I know the difference between \"gringo\" Mexican Food and authentic.  Some of the posts here say that the food was \"authentic\" but I disagree.  Here are some observations that you should know:

- Rice & Beans; not robust in flavor and really no better than the instant stuff you can microwave out of a package.  The rice is not only bland, it's \"heavy\" and not \"light\" like I used to get in Tijuana, Mexico or San Diego.  I'm not being too critical because you can get something close to authentic at some of the chain Mexican restaurants.

- Queso; the one with ground beef is delicious and just the right flavor.  It's not spicy, just flavorful.

- Burritos; I had a beef burrito and it had a coupe of strips of very salty beef and tons of onions, peppers and \"stuffers.\"  I'm not suggestion tons other items are bad, but there wasn't a protein/stuffer balance.  Heck the quality and taste of the meat at Q'Doba is superior.  

- Burritos Part 2; Be aware that all the burritos come \"wet' with isn't bad but just a surprise.  The burrito my daughter had on the kids menu came \"wet\" and she wouldn't eat it.  The ground beef inside was agains extremely salty.  

- The Wrap; This is a pet peeve with me and Mexican restaurants that claim to be authentic.  Don't serve tortillas that you buy from a wholesale distributer.  In LA most of my favorite Mexican restaurants either made their own tortillas or bought them from someone who did.  A good tortilla by itself with nothing on it can be a treat.

- Tacos; just beware that some tacos come \"wet\" and not what you expect.  Ask first how it's prepared.  In two decades I grew up in Los Angeles, I never had a \"wet\" taco at a Mexican restaurant or at a friend's home.  I grew up in Huntington Park which is 905 Hispanic.  Again, those of you who are raving about this place being \"authentic,\" I really don't understand."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Chips were stale. They were out of a beer we ordered. Service was okay. He. Kept walking away before we could ask to order or tell him we needed another drink. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Driving around this area...I found this restaurant...nice decorated. ..Saturday 1 pm.  Only two servers..running delivering food. Taking calls. And seating customers...any way  chips ok..salsa watery kind spice for me.I know they can make better for sure.  Our lunch took longer than normal..but we were satisfied, Flavor , Presentation. I'll make new stop."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with a 8 friends last night. It was a busy Saturday night. I was glad we'd made a reservation. 

Service was a little bit spacey. Waitress got confused a couple times. Nothing to freak out about. She was gracious and apologetic about it. 

Sangria is amazing. A-mazing. 

I had the Enchiladas Mestizas. Holy goodness. I'm craving them again already!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner last Friday night 12/5/14.the food is Delicious ,great,the best Mexican I've had personally ....the service is excellent ,my server Emanuel knew how to make my wife's and my dinning experience an unforgettable one , the owners margaritas and mojitos are the best ..regardless of the loud and rude party of 12-14 who were being very loud and rude to our server ..we will be coming back !!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos were horrible.  No flavor, wet shells.  Just  yuck.  I don't care if it's authentic or not.  I just want food that tastes good. This didn't.  At. all.

I understand the fajitas were great. Two friends got that.

The take-out order I got at the end of the meal was missing all of the condiments when I got home, and not one of the three take-out meals I got my family were edible.  

I made a reservation for 5.  They weren't prepared when we arrived and so five of us were seated at a booth with a chair at the end.  It was very cramped, and I wondered why I bothered to give them the benefit of knowing we were coming if they weren't going to give me the benefit of being prepared.  We ordered appetizers, drinks, meals, and all of that didn't fit on a table for four.  It just didn't work.

The margarita was great, but I honestly don't think there was alcohol in the thing. 

Lastly, the waitress didn't ask if we wanted separate checks and acted like she was frustrated when she had to separate them for us."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Mexican around
Very Bland food and the 
Margaritas  were all Mix. This place is One and done"}
{"text":"Went here for the free bean and cheese dip. It was pretty good! Got the lunch special chicken tacos and I enjoyed them. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. They hooked us up with free desert. Would probably come back if I was in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"I visited La Catrina for a friend's birthday dinner and was pretty disappointed. The hostess was not very friendly and seemed irritated that we wanted to sit outside. Since she could give us no information on when we might be seated outside, we ended up inside, which was very cold. We were not given silverware or napkins until I went to ask for them. I ordered a Dos Equis Amber which was listed under the draft beers, but I was brought a bottle. The table seemed very sticky and dirty - I did not want to touch it. 

We ordered queso for the table which was totally delicious. We made it disappear, but were not able to put out the flame underneath it so just sat on our table smelling of burning cheese. 

I ordered the Ropa Vieja and the beef was very flavorful and tender. That was definitely the majority of the dish - it was served with very little white rice (maybe four good bites) and three little slices of plantains. 

One of the girls in our party told the staff twice that it was our friend's birthday and we were on a tight schedule trying to make a movie. I totally understand that it must be hard to round up enough staff to bring out the cake and sing the birthday song, but the restaurant was nearly empty and they really did not seem in a hurry to help us out. We were ultimately late. On a positive note, the tres leches cake was so, so good! I think I ate more than the birthday girl. 

Overall, I wish their service matched the quality of the food. I know of other Mexican places where I can get a real draft beer and receive better service."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with wife 10/3/14.  Waitress didn't write down order & repeated it back wrong.  Delivered one meal with cold beef and second order all wrong - why didn't she write it down? 
Chips & salsa were great!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican in Charlotte!  I tried my fair share of Mexican joints in the Queen City and, in my opinion, this is the best!  Additionally, it is the most affordable.  They offer excellent lunch specials for under $10!  You can't beat that.  

So, let me start with the best.  Carnitas Criollas!!  Large chunks of Mexican fried pork with marinated onions that are to die for!  This dish is absolutely worth trying and, honestly, it's what keeps me coming back for more.  It is a large portion and be prepared to take some home.  Or just dive in and pay the price of fullness, haha.  I also branched out one day and got the flour chicken enchiladas.  They were excellent as well and came with three different sauces that complimented each enchilada perfectly.  Mole, tomatillo, and queso - I believe.   Chips and salsa were plentiful and the chips come out nice and warm every time.  It's the little things, ya know?

Drink selections is vast as well but I keep going back to my Go To...  The Mexican Bulldog (they call it a coronita).  Simply, it is a margarita on the rocks with a corona flipped upside down in the drink.  Trust me... It's awesome!   

The environment and staff are always helpful and welcoming and we always have a wonderful experience here.  Soon, we will be remembered as regulars, haha!  \"Ian, Sara... the usuals today?.... Yes sir!\"

Enjoy!
