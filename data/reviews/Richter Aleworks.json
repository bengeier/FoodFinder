{"text":"I love Richter Aleworks, it's the Cheers we needed. Friendly owners want to know you and serve excellent beer!"}
{"text":"This place has a great beer selection but the atmosphere is lacking. Very quiet inside. The food was okay but I think they just need to focus on their beer instead of trying to do too much."}
{"text":"My favorite place to hang out and have incredible beer. The staff is awesome, helpful and incredibly fun.  Great neighborhood family owned Brewery."}
{"text":"What a breath of fresh air in North Peoria! They have a brew for every palate and charming service to boot. The owners show excellent sense of community through serving beers from various brewers throughout the state and include a couple of their own. I always meet the nicest patrons and feel nothing but care from the staff when I stop in."}
{"text":"Great beer, great owners, great vibe. Love this brewery"}
{"text":"Trying out a new local brewery. I thought I'd give them a couple of months to settle in before I tried it out.  It has been here for at least a couple of months, since I saw the PR in AZ Republic.  Still no local brewing (only other's beer/\"joint venture\" brews) or food (except what appears to be par baked pizza & food truck on Saturdays), big plans but it sounds like planning & execution are lacking thus far. Apparently issues with City permitting, etc.  They definitely at least need some snack type food and at least one brew that is truly their own.  Bartender was friendly but definitely nothing special given lack of home brews and food.  They will need to re-launch with some significant marketing push once they are brewing and have some food, or they won't make it, imho.  We shall see. Meanwhile I'll be heading back to PAB, Char Pizza or even Fry's Marketplace for my local beer and growler fills."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop off for a beer. New business but they have great service and tasty beer. Nice TV's with plenty of sports to watch. This will be one of my stops every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Super lame.  No customer service skills.  Brewers don't even make eye contact.  So disappointed.  We try to support local business.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place to throw back some beers. Personable brewmaster and owners. Definitely has a neighorhood feel to it. Background music would be my only suggestion to add to the ambiance, I know they're working on it."}
{"text":"Might have four stars IF there was a kitchen, more of their own brewed beers (there were only two of at least a dozen) and some ambiance. Pretty basic inside. Been open two weeks but seemed like it was still too early and lots of stuff left undone. They didn't have flights - yet - because they didn't have the glassware, and when we asked for water, we got a warm bottle of Kirkland. 

While the brewmaster was very informative and friendly, the owners were also there but not really interacting with anyone. Every other new local place we've been, the owners have made it a point to talk to people and thank them for coming in. It's a great way to make customers feel valued and want to come back. 

All that said, would love to see the place succeed. Props to them for opening a neighborhood brewery, but wasn't feeling the passion we read about. Best of luck."}
{"text":"The beer was great. The bartender was friendly. Not a big location (maybe 10 Tables + Bar), no outdoor seating. 

We tried this out yesterday for the first time. It's a local micro-brew which I was excited about. There were maybe 12 People at about 2pm yesterday (Saturday), stopped in for a drink. Two bartenders (one male, one female). 

After about 10 minutes, we were never acknowledged, I had to ask the bartender if I was supposed to go up to the bar to order. He apologized and came right over. We ordered two beers, and asked if we could have a food menu. He brought over the two beers and the food menu, and never came back. We sat there for about 15 minutes talking, drinking our beers. Neither of the bartenders looked over or asked if we needed a refill. 

Once my beer was sitting empty for 5 minutes, I had to again stand up and walk over towards the bar to get their attention and ask for the check. I was never asked if I needed another beer, never asked if we decided to order food (which we had). I will not be returning.

Pros:  Ok atmosphere, would be great if they had some outdoor seating. Possibly put Garage Doors instead of the large window which could open up to outside.  Bartenders were friendly when speaking with them. They also checked every glass before filling to assure they were clean.

Cons:  Poor service. with only 3 Tables filled, and 4 people at the bar and two bartenders, I would have thought they would have tried to sell more food/beer. 

Suggestions to Management: Spend more time with customers so you have repeat business. I was good for at least 2 more beers and food, but we decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been to Richter several times now.   It is a pretty cool spot in an area that desperately needs cool spots.  Richter is family own and ran shop.  The owners are all pretty cool.  The son is usually running the taps when I have went in.  

The place is fairly small.  Funny the sign says \"Occupancy 69 Seriously!\"  I can't imagine 69 people fitting in here comfortably.  I would guess 30-40 max.  All the times I have been there is under 20 people here.  The inside has a large bar and several high tops and low tops.  There are some cool signs on the walls, really unique tap handles, and a tv with sports on.

Enough with the setting and on to the beer.  This is the real reason we come to a brewery no?  Richter has 13 taps rolling on rotation.  3-4 of them are usually house brews and the rest are AZ craft.  I'm talking true craft not that bullshit sellout fourpeaks bunk shit.  I am talking Tombstone, OHSO, Barrio, Dragoon, Historic Pie Hole Porter ohfuckyeah!  I'm always doing flights in here cause all this shit is money.  

I am bummed that not more people are coming here and digging this place.  We need more shit like this around here.  Sucks they don't have a kitchen but they do get food trucks and allow you to bring in food.  So hit up that bomb ass Italian joint with slow and shitty service across the parking lot and eat it here!

Support true local craft!"}
{"text":"April, Bubba, & The Dude with the beard (can't remember his name to save my life)  are the sweetest people. Family  owned  pub with a constantly changing selection. Come for your birthday and get a birthday sized beer! 

Honestly it's just a plain and simple pub run by an awesome family. 

The beers are great. I can't handle a lot of alcohol so I get the $2 samplers and taste a few new beers each time I go. My friends are definitely regulars here. And they pretty much drink the whole menu."}
{"text":"Great Beer!!! Food trucks on weekends! Friendly staff... Tv with the games on! Great place for playoffs!!"}
{"text":"Great local family place! The beer was good, the food was good, service was great and everyone was friendly - seems like you become like Family quickly around here."}
{"text":"Some great brews. All local drafts plus their own unique and delicious brews. I'm a fan. It's so nice to have good options over in the West Valley. I really do recommend."}
{"text":"Very unexpected! Food was tasty beer was yummy, nice and quiet atmosphere. We'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"We're always looking for local micro breweries to check out around Phoenix and Richter did not disappoint. Great beer and despite a small menu what they do have is very  good. I recommend the buffalo chicken pizza and a few beers of course!"}
{"text":"We were making our own beer tour and we made this one of the stops and it was a great choice. The atmosphere is eh but what made up for it were the Owner and Erica the, beerista(she also works at Starbucks) and the beer.  They have 2 of their own on tap and then lots of other local different stuff.  They have a small menu of food, we had some garlic cheese bread bites to munch on and it was tasty. They have lots of different seating from smaller tables to big long ones and a huge bar, which was nice.  Erica and Mrs.R(I didn't get her name or I could have but I had had a few drinks) were awesome!  They were super personable and funny which makes you want to go back somewhere.  It's not super close to where we live but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes but the beer has crazy aftertastes and isn't really worth the trip.  I hope they improve because they have a great spot!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and friendly service.  My wife and I visited this local family run brewery last visit and plan to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good IPA this is the place. The owner is friendly and very welcoming. Good variety of brews on the menu."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because its new and has tremendous potential and i love seeing non-chains in this part of town (it is so desperately needed). The staff is friendly and you really feel like you are just hanging out in someone's home. The beers were tasty and while they do not currently serve food, they had a food truck camped outside for those who need a bite with their brews. Would definitely come back, would like to see more options for food but I am sure that they are getting there. Don't expect anything fancy -- be cool and give this place the time that it needs to grow."}
{"text":"Awesome brewery! Their beers are great and their food pairs well with it. Plus, the owners take the time to make sure all your needs are met."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Owners are very friendly and very down to earth. Great atmosphere as well. Nice to see a brewery on the west side that also supports other local breweries. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Their beer is amazing and the food is delicious. If you're looking to get some delicious beer this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Cutest, funniest sweetest owners! Beer variety and fun, new establishment. Excited to see them grow!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. It's a brewery but only two beers were theirs, and the bar tender pretended that they all were? The staff greeted us and then didn't pay much attention the rest of the time. Considering I work in the beer industry and was looking to get some kegs distributed, they didn't make a great impression at all. The other beers they had on tap were awesome. Theirs were alright. One tasted like Sculpin and the other was okay.

Edit: Considering the condescending and unprofessional response I got from this review, here's a tip. A little training in hospitality and customer service goes a long way. Responses to criticism are not how you build your business. If a trip to California will help employees be more engaging and helpful in answering questions then by all means please stop by. Any form of criticism clearly does not go over well with your business so hopefully nobody else who walks through your doors is as unsatisfied or they'll really be given a reason to stay away. 

By the way, you really have no place to comment on unprofessionalism after your response. You're running a business, not being caddy to another girl in your high school class.

P. S. Thank you for publicly showing how professional you are. I'm assuming you're the woman that stood at the end of bar, wearing cat ears, the entire 45 minutes we were there. Considering you said all of 2 things to us and the entirety of our visit was spent trying to ask questions to the younger gentleman behind the bar, I don't see how your nasty remarks are warranted. Please continue to act this way on a site where are trying to promote your business. I wish you the best of luck because it looks like you desperately need it. By the way, I never actually said I didn't like your beer. We just didn't find it very impressionable. Cheers."}
{"text":"Great Brewery!! Amazing flatbread and a perfect local hangout for the west side. Awesome brewmaster and I'm a huge fan of local and family owned businesses. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We love going when there's a food truck! Trying new beers is always fun, and the service is great"}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least! Awkward & uncomfortable environment. The owners sat at the end of the bar stuffing their faces with food & beer & didn't take their eyes off of their phones/computer the entire 2 hours we were there. They said they offered food but only had frozen pizza. The beer was ok. The only positive was the bottled of water."}
{"text":"Great up and coming local brewery. Have tried both their beers: Pale Ale and IPA and both are excellent. The owners and Brewmaster are all extremely friendly. This place definitely has potential and am looking forward to trying more of their brews. NW side of town has needed a place like this and Richter delivers"}
{"text":"Talk about amazing people... it's what America is all about.. the service, top notch!! They are beautiful, kind, caring and holy crap.. the beer is amazing!!! I drank St. Viriletus and was immediately transported to the golden age where men were men and women served the men!! You're welcome for the history lesson people.. I'm a woman and I believe these things!! They truly have the nectar of the Gods!!! My boyfriend totally didn't write this and you're welcome!! Try this SH#T!!'"}
{"text":"The buffalo ranch flatbread was great and the beer was top notch. Friendly service, I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Hit this place on a recent visit to the area.  I just don't get it...  Is it a brewery?  If yes, why did they only have one of their own beers on?  Is it a tap room?  If yes, why so few taps?

The good:  The place was clean, had places to sit.  Serves beer.  Well curated taps.  Service was pleasant.  Seemed to be family friendly.

The bad:  lack of identity.  No beer descriptions (this is HUGE).  Off-putting music  (90's hard rock).  Owners(?) sitting in branded gear drinking at the end of the bar.  No outdoor seating (maybe not an option?)

Not having beer descriptions in a beer bar is just wrong.  I'm a beer snob, and i know styles, but i want to about the beers I'm drinking.    The music thing was just kind of weird.  I\"m cool with loud music, and I actually like the music that was playing, but it was a talking point while sitting there between my parents and I.  Works to keep out the older crowd, maybe that's the goal (can't blame them).  

While nothing was wrong here, there just wasn't much right.  The place was a ghost town, while another brewery down the road was packed.  It just wasn't a comfortable or compelling place to hang out.  Wish them them the best, but it won't be on my agenda next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If there was ever a place to call your home away from home, this is it. The best selection of beers, yummy food to snack on, and the best owners ever. This is the place to meet up with your friends & play Dominos or cards or just catch up on life. Still waiting for the pool where we can all sit and cool off, but that will surely come in time"}
{"text":"This place is a great up and coming brewery on the west side of town. Really like the place and the owners!  Great beers on tap. Sounds like they will have some great brews coming too!!"}
