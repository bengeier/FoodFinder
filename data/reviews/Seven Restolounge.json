{"text":"Just went for lunch there today, May 18, 2010.  It was a really good experience.  Different experience during the daytime than at night with the nightclub thing happening.

Food - really good food cooked just right.  I had the steak sandwich, thick slab of meat, and I ordered it medium rare.  In most places, this is risky as you aren't sure what to expect.  This steak came out perfect, dark pink in the middle to pale pink on the edges.  Good seasoning, good carmelization.  Came with sweet potato fries - again, well done, not too greasy.  My friend had the halibut, gave me a sample - 5 / 5!  It was cooked just right (again), and came with seasonal veggies.  Both dishes well made.
Service - friendly, efficient and fast.  The servers were well-dressed, catering to a more upper-end crowd, but not snobby at all.  

All in all - nice clean new place, good food, will definitely return."}
{"text":"As far as dance clubs go, this one isn't bad.
Having gone there at about 11pm on a Saturday night, we found a fairly packed and lively scene with a dj spinning everything from top 40 dance to oldschool 90's hits (wow, did I just call the 90's oldschool?). The people we were meeting had a nice in (one guy's brother was the Manager) so needless to say, we bypassed the line, got a prime table and free shots lol. So 'maybe' I'm a lil biased but it was a rather fun place to observe, dance and just hang out.

It is small though so there's not a lot of room to move about in or places to go so if you're going with a really large group, I'd say go elsewhere. But it's pretty suave in its looks and now that I know it's a resto-lounge too, I'd be inclined to revisit in earlier hours sometimes."}
{"text":"I was rather underwhelmed by the cool, unmemorable decor, but that is not why I ultimately go out to eat. 

A friend and I sat at the bar and got really slow service from a very busy bartender. The drinks were excellent but the food only okay. 

The duck wontons could have used some crispy skin, five spice powder and scallions, as it were they were mushy and bland, the steak and mushroom soup was glorious - the best in the city easily. The seafood crepes were... gross. Imagine shrimp in a tinny tasting tomato sauce folded into a crepe - the whole thing being soggy and bland. The entrees were completely not memorable and given the cost clearly not worth it. 

I would return for drinks and appetizers but would not make a meal out of it. Given the high prices there is just no justification."}
{"text":"Kind of like it here and not really sure why.  I held an event here with a colleague and I must say my first impression was that this place seemed kind of pretencious.  With the light blue and white lights they have and all the decor, it kind of felt like the place was playing upscale-big-city-bar.  However, as the night went on and I had a few drinks the place really grew on me.  The service was excellent and fast, food was decent and the music had me vibing.  Kind of felt like I was in Toronto for a moment.  Had a good time!"}
{"text":"This was the second bar in a self-led pub crawl around downtown Calgary last night. Our little group arrived around midnight so I'll only be reviewing the lounge part and not so much the resto. There was a DJ, but nobody was on the dance floor. The place was actually pretty empty. We scored a nice corner table and our waitress was efficient. I had the best dark rum and diet coke I've had in a long time, maybe ever at a bar. The bathroom was nice - spacious and clean. The music wasn't extremely loud so it was amenable to conversation. It was a pretty good experience, but nothing about it makes me want to rush back so I'm giving it an A-OK."}
{"text":"Restolounge by day, dance club by night. Now THIS is what I'm talkin' about. A place that caters to MY needs - open whenever *I* feel like going. Seriously.

Seven has a great vibe and a great ambiance. The location is prime (located on 8th Ave - on the cusp of Stephen Ave, and surrounded by movie theatres & restaurants), and the staff is professional. I especially like the crowd - a lot of older people. Not many teeny boppers, but rather business professionals and a more mature crowd.

It is a little small, but as long as you're not expecting a massive group, then you'll be just fine.

Definitely one of the better lounges/clubs in our city."}
{"text":"AHHHHHHHHHH.... MAN WHAT HAPPENED?! 
WHY CALGARY WHY?! 

I cannot express my frustration enough! I'm sooo let down!! I remember back in the day how full of GREATNESS Seven use to be! Great music! Awesome crowd! Overall it was better than the Met back then!

I've been a few times over the summer.. I'm a big fan of hip-hop.. but after the last two times I cannot go back! Yes.. it plays great hip hop (though what DJ doesn't play the first verse to California Love??? -- WTF).. but that's where it ends. 

It's crowded, smelly, has glass and drinks spilled all over the floor. It's like a wrestling match to get between the dance floor and the bathrooms. 

Before you enter there's some pretentious ass bouncers that you know aspired to have this exact occupation when they were graduating high school. I have NO idea how their \"entry\" system works.. but it's absolutely ridiculous. I expected much more efficiency and professionalism from such an establishment. 

One thing you will not find for sure is professionalism.. or any young professionals. It's full of 18 year olds.. and men who stand around wearing sunglasses.

.. Which brings me to the bouncer screaming out that there's a strict dress code.. HOWEVER... you see men inside with dirty shoes, hoodies, etc. O, and the females aren't much better, what kind of dress code allows women to dress from the Stitches clearance rack? 

Other than the disgusting crowd, lame bouncers, lack of professional service, the nail in the coffin really is the bathrooms! Anyone who has visited knows that they have a really nice bathroom... but for some reason they clearly aren't making enough $$$ to hire a bathroom attendant. This place is in dire need of a full time attendant. The state of the bathroom was absolutely revolting. I cannot believe females even go in there, broken bottles and toilet paper everywhere. (I understand this is a reflection of their current client√®le). Not only that, but I witnessed some real ghetto ass bathroom fights.. again a reflection of the immature patrons they have. 

Needless to say I won't be going back, and would never consider hosting a private event here, or even drop by for dinner. 

So much potential. So sad to see it go down the drain. I guess I'll wait 6 more months for it to hit rock bottom, close, re-brand it self and reopen."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Seven today.  Here's my experience at Seven.  It started off with the matre-d not able to locate my reservation on their system.  He kept asking me my name and I told him that I had booked it on OpenTable.  OpenTable actually even sent me a reminder so I know Seven has the reservation.  Finally, he located it.  

I got there first and waited for my 2 friends to arrive.  The waitress came by and checked on me and got me my water and said she'd bring over menus later as she was short on them.  Go figure!  Short on menus??  

My friends finally arrived.  We waited for a long while till the waitress brought us menus.  We cornered her quickly and ordered our food.  Food took about 15 mins to arrive and noticed that other tables that were there earlier than us, did not get their food till much later, like an hour later!!  

I ordered the West Coast Chicken Club with the Mushroom Soup.  I must say  I liked the Mushroom Soup a lot and the sandwich was good.  Found the ciabatta bread a little tough to eat.  The chicken was moist and the garlic aioli adds to the moistness.  My companions ordered the pasta dishes:  Butternut Squash Ravioli and the Roasted Chicken Penne.  One friend like the ravioli.  The other didn't care for the pancetta bacon in her penne. 

Then, we waited and we waited for the waitress to come by so that we could pack up some of our leftovers.  The waitress finally came, gave us the bill.  All this took 1/2 hour!!  Gosh, the service sucks here!

Food - so-so
Service - really, really bad!"}
{"text":"Seven is now closed.
They started out strong, but the last 12-18 months has been a disaster zone.  Bad food, terrible service, & dodgy clientele.

Bye Bye Seven!"}
