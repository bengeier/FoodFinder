{"text":"Really hit the spot for comforting Chinese food. Delivery was super quick. Portions were large. Beef lo mein had a good amount of meat for its pint size, and the noodles had a nice chew and toasty flavor. Cashew chicken was tasty and nicely greasy. Hot and sour soup was yummy but a bit on the salty side. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"I tried the wanton soup again, even though it's always gross.  I probably did this because I'm retarded.  But surprise, it was actually good!   Go figure"}
{"text":"I don't know if other reviewers are mistaking this place with another very good restaurant or what. My experience was totally the opposite of a 5 star. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and I swear to tap dancing jesus is was NOT red meat. Instead it was Gushy, Gummy, Weird tasting.... at some point while eating started to believe it was dog or cat meat. The fried rice tasted like nothing. Ended up throwing away everything."}
{"text":"Nice Chinese take-out place for students. Cheap /Large / Portion /Tasty If you are students who want to save some bucks and enjoy the tasty Chinese food at the same time ,this is definitely a good choice."}
{"text":"The food isn't great, but the lunch deal is a really good deal and it is significantly cheaper than fugu. The late night hours on the weekend are just amazing. I've had drunk late night meals from there often."}
{"text":"*Let me preface this review with that I already stopped ordering from here in the past due to the taste, texture and quality of their food.  I decided to give Asian kitchen another chance again due to them offering cheaper/no fees on Grub Hub.*  Over the past few weeks I ordered twice:  First time, i was enjoying my night and I would have to say, the food was okay and timely... but nothing special, it was just filling on a late night after being out.  Second time, which was just this past Sunday, I decided to order my standard order of crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken or tofu. I immediately noticed the rangoon were either refried and old or overfried, but definitely off. Next I moved on to the General Tso's tofu, it was squishy and slimey per usual and most of it got thrown out. Needless to say, it was not filling or appetizing.   What I didn't expect was to wake mid way through the night with wrenching pain in my gut. From that moment on, I was visiting the restroom at least every 2 hrs. This lasted for the next 12 hrs. I assumed it was food poisoning and just worked to get out of my system anything I ate, the last thing being Asian Kitchen! But I was sure that since I had nothing to eat for hours before Asian kitchen, it was the catalyst of my bathroom trips.  Overall, I will forever avoid this restaurant because every time you order with Asian kitchen you are playing roulette with a bout of food poisoning. I guess if your wasted, the alcohol may kill off any bacteria in their old, slimey, refried food. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This place has blown me away consistently with some of it food. I love the bok choy dishes with either chicken or beef. I also love the beef lo mein. Ask for it spicy and it makes it even better. There also have yummy garlic wings and the king pao chicken is top notch. It is disappointing to eat chinese food from other take our places after eating here."}
{"text":"Its great because its what american chinese food is supposed to be. Quick, cheap, dirty, and delicious! Great portions, great price. It'll fill you up, have no fear.   My personal favorite is to get the sesame chicken, and have a friend get the chicken with veggies. Then you kinda mix the two together so you get a little veggie, and a little sesame chicken. Your free \"sides\" include lots of fried or steamed rice AND a great egg roll.   Its not health food by any stretch, but its less greasy than other places (the right amount of grease in my book)."}
{"text":"If you live on campus, you should definitely check this place out.   Food overall is good, but can definitely be HIT or MISS. Pretty sure I got food poisoning once from the Chicken and Broccoli, so I just don't order it anymore. LOVE the spring rolls and fried rice. LARGE PORTIONS! Delivery can take a LONG time, so I'd pick it up if possible. The people working the counter are usually surly, but I probably would be to if I worked there."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I'm a student that eats with my parents and goes out with my friends to eat many types of cultural foods since I love the differences. I just had to say that the peanut butter chicken they had was like the best thing that I've eaten in my life. I was really confused why they didn't have it when I ordered before and they said it was a new item and people may have an allergy to it.I have tried many types of peanut butter chicken from lots of places this was the best! I am defeninantly in love with it!!!!!!!!!!!!  Confined to come here since homework/school things kept coming up. I love the late hours and new things on the menu!"}
{"text":"asian kitchen  is  my   favarite  restaurant  in   madison.   they  have new  menu  such  as  penut   butter   chicken  ;  mogolian   chicken-  and    basil   chicken  and pai  tai.  happy  famliamy-  they  are taste   very  good ,yummy"}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen has been my guilty (but not really guilty) pleasure throughout my college career. If you want inexpensive, delicious, greasy, Chinese-American food, then Asian Kitchen is you! I have been on a lo mein kick recently. At $7.49 for a quart, their beef lo mein does not disappoint. Pair that with some crab rangoons and you are all set!   I think many know that Asian Kitchen is not a place for a truly \"authentic\" Chinese meal. However it delivers until 3am on Friday and Saturday nights and can be a really good pick-me-up when I'm in a jam."}
{"text":"I ordered Asian Kitchen tonight through EatStreet. The app says \"40-50 minutes\" for delivery....my food came in less than 25 minutes.   It was hot, it tasted really good (I got the Szechuan beef--kids got sweet n sour and general Tso's). The delivery guy was extremely friendly and even jogged over to me at the door, despite the fact that they were already super early.   I was very impressed by the service and will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy chinese food.  Lunch combo is really cheap price and large portion.  If you are students ,this is definitely a good choice. However, this is not the best Chinese food in town."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant for my first time this Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see that they are open late so I did some take out around 9pm.   Two things that need to be emphasized...   #1 Unbeatable price for the amount of food.  #2 Below average quality.   $7.60 for a take out order of the General Tso's Chicken. That was about the only positive part. The chicken wasn't very warm which made me question if it was made to order. No consistency with the chicken... some dry and crispy...some mushy and soggy.   Overall feeling--- not bad. I guess I can't be too picky when spending seven bucks for Wednesday evening take out."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted.  The low prices, large portions, and late hours have always been extremely attractive to me (mostly the inebriated, 2 am me), but after probably 10 trips to this establishment, I've finally called it quits.  While I've never experienced the bouts of food borne illness that some of my fellow yelpers have alluded to, I do agree that this place is FAR from clean. If you're going to order from here, you should make it delivery--at least then you don't have to look at the filth while you're waiting to receive your food. If you DO order delivery, make sure to check your order BEFORE the delivery guy leaves. On more than one occasion, I've received the wrong order and the delivery person had sped off before I had even opened the bag (or given him a tip!)  Things I've tried from here:   EGG ROLL: dry and flavorless, and the only filling inside of it is shredded cabbage (how can cabbage be so dry????)  ORANGE CHICKEN: over-breaded, overly sweet, dry, and of terrible quality. If you cut into the pieces, the brown chicken on the inside is revealed  CRAB RANGOON: DRY, little to no crab flavor (certainly no pieces of crab....I'm convinced that it's just plain cream cheese inside and they're betting on the placebo effect creating some sort of crabby undertone)  GENERAL TSO'S TOFU: rubbery, overly sweet...just don't do it...it's so bad  FRIED RICE: hands down the WORST fried rice I've ever tasted in my entire life....I don't even think they fry it...it's (you guessed it) DRY, hard, there's no trace of egg in it at all, and it mostly just tastes like white rice that has been lightly coated in soy sauce. SERIOUSLY DO NOT GO THERE. DON\"T GET THE FRIED RICE IT'S SO BAD I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH  POTSTICKERS (STEAMED): they actually taste really freaking good....but the meat inside is questionable at best   All of that said, I have a good feeling that this place will continue to be a late-night staple for the foreseeable future, but I'm telling you: if you're looking for GOOD chinese food (perhaps for a girl's/guy's night in, movie marathon, late night study sesh, or literally any other occasion), STEER CLEAR OF ASIAN KITCHEN!!!!  My best Chinese food recommendation: FUGU Asian fusion on Gilman street. That place is BOMB."}
{"text":"This is one of the tastiest restaurants in the area.  Dine-in or take-out is always hot, fresh, and superb.  I love the hot and sour soup.  It's vegetarian and lacks none of the richness of soups with meat or meat stock.  The spring rolls and lo mein are delicious.. looking forward to trying the yellow curry next time.  Staff is always sweet and amazing.  (Yellow curry turned out AMAZING, btw)"}
{"text":"The food is good, but it is very annoying that they will deliver to my house some days and not other days..... Your delivery range is 3 miles and grub hub says I live 2.8 miles away, mapquest says 3.3.  Either way I think its close enough.  Don't be jerks and deliver me some damn Asian food when I want it, not just on days when you have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"This place still reigns supreme... Twice Asparagus, egg rolls and all soups Rock My Socks.  Highly recommend Malaysian Satay Style Beef and Amazing Duck."}
{"text":"Generous portions, reasonable prices. The food is nothing spectacular, but as far as inexpensive chinese food goes, it's at the top of its class."}
{"text":"I'm under no illusion that Asian Kitchen serves the finest Chinese cuisine that Madison has to offer, but this place has always been reliable for my (often alcohol induced) late night munchies. They specialize in filling, greasy, MSG-laden gooey deliciousness that hits the spot for me every single time and they delivery quickly. What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has really improved over the last few years. Good prices and good food. Grub hub never sent my order and after I called, they sent my order out very quickly!"}
{"text":"Greasy big portions pretty much describes the food. It's decent if you're a poor college student with no cooking skills and a lack of dinero... and it also sure as heck tastes a lot better when you're drunk.   It's typical Americanized Chinese food but it's filling (think an extra night's worth of dinner) and the price is right."}
{"text":"Kung poppus corpus!!! Great for law students interested in slop!!!! Late nights are rough... Got to take a load off and put a load of this crap in your justice stomping stomach compactor!!!! Really comes out the next morning in random spurts... Be careful......... Oh and when they say it'll be 10 minutes, they actually mean 4 hours"}
{"text":"I've been here 6 times now. I will have plus and minus, as always.  I'll do minus first. Which is rare. And it's minor. There's a definite language barrier. I ask for certain things extra spicy. And after two times of these exact words, I've received food that was at a heat level of zero!  I totally understand language issues. And don't discount the food, because it's pretty damn good. But, when I want spicy, and emphasize it. I don't want bland. Please relay this! Now plus. Pretty much all of it! The red and green curry dishes are wonderful. The Singapore mei fun is amazing. Tom kria soup, yes please! Look at the difference, not the typical. This is not a general tsos kinda spot. If that's your thing, cool. It's impossible to fuck up. Expand your horizons, please!"}
{"text":"Better than average Asian takeout restaurant. More diverse menu then the average place. So far the red curry with tofu is my favorite. The tofu is good, chicken and shrimp are average. Haven't tried the beef. Good menu, good prices, good food. No complaints."}
{"text":"Ordered Orange Shrimp & Scallops.  It was a wonderful meal in Chef's sauce with some broccoli & white rice.  Also ordered chicken fried rice which was also delicious.  So many different meals on the menu making it hard to make decision.  Truly recommend the Asian Kitchen."}
{"text":"This review is only for delivery. I ordered spicy General Tso's Chicken for delivery and it took roughly thirty minutes to get to my apartment. I was pleasantly surprised at the low price - it came with veggies, rice, and was still only around $10 including delivery fee.   The food itself was pretty much what I expect from an Americanized Asian food place. There was a generous portion of chicken, a little overcooked but hey, I'll take overcooked chicken over undercooked chicken any day. The sauce was flavorful enough but I had ordered it spicy and it just seemed like regular General Tso's sauce - not enough spice. The rice and veggies were fine and I still had enough left over for lunch the next day so all in all, I really can't complain. Go in with the expectations of this being cheap, filling, not-authentic Chinese food and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For being your typical americanized chinese place, this place satisfies. I've ordered from them several times at this point. If you're into the whole \"not-really-chinese-food\" chinese food or need that fix, definitely give this place a try. It's cheap, fast, and they have all your standard items. The only weird thing is that their general tso's isn't that good and typically that's a favorite. Their fried rice is great though, I've tried them all and chicken definitely is the best."}
{"text":"Got the Triple Green Delight one night early in my Madison stay, looking for a quick and cheap dinner. And it was quick and cheap ($7.10, I think). Order is broccoli, snap peas, and green beans over fried rice with a reasonably spicy sauce. It did not reinvent my concept of the possibilities for Chinese carryout, but neither did it let me down. The portions were big, the veggies seemed freshly cooked, and I was good to go. The store was not spotless, but neither did it fill me with fear. Although the three-star average for this business has been achieved by wildly divergent nostalgia trips and horror stories, between them they got the average of my experience just about right. You, Asian Kitchen, were A-OK to me, and were I hungry or drunk, a full-time resident of Madison, and in need of comfort, I just might have come knocking on your door a second time."}
{"text":"The delivery service was very fast, although it was late at night, so I can't compare to normal dinner time hours. Also, all I got was was their Crab Rangoon, which was really good! Would definitely recommend theirs."}
{"text":"I ordered Asian kitchen for delivery. Delivery fee is only $1 so that was nice. Food arrived quickly. The food was pretty much what you would except for Chinese take out. Have I had better? Yes. But for the price I would get it again."}
{"text":"Actually the worst service to ever be in existence. I ordered a delivery 2 and half hours ago and was supposed to get it after 45. When I asked for a refund or discount on my food they refused. the employees I talked to barely spoke English and just hung up on me. DONT GO HERE"}
{"text":"The food is incredibly greasy-- as Americanized Chinese food should be. The portions are large, and they serve till late at night (delivery too). It's also cheap! super cheap! and you'll have food left over for the next day.  However, it's not the best food in the world, but when you're drunk and it's late and you don't feel like having pizza, Asian Kitchen is the place to go. It's also a health-nut's worst nightmare, but then again if you're eating Chinese take-out, you're probably not a health-freak.   It's not the cleanest establishment either, but if you order-out you'd never know the difference. Stay away from the bathrooms if you can, they're pretty gross."}
{"text":"OMG so freaking good there is a reason why this place has been on State St. For almost two decades..the food is good plentiful and inexpensive if your on a budget try a combo filling and fast.. everything is made fresh to order...my favorite I have been ordering for the last 15years general tsos tofu...just woofed down my order. Hope you enjoy...Bon Appetit"}
{"text":"It's like this - This place is not the type of place that you want to see. You don't want to know that your food is coming from somewhere this sticky and dirty.   But, I have yet to find General Tso's tofu that is half as delicious as the one they have there. It's SO good. Also, the vegetables are always crisp and fresh, and you can tell they made your food right before they brought it to you. The egg rolls are pretty tasty too. Basically, it's really good American Chinese food.  Now if it the place wasn't such a disaster..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always fresh and tastes amazing. Crab rangoons are my favorite.  Portions are huge so makes up for the price"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had in Madison.  And their General's Tofu is one that I've been trying to find a match for in Normal, Il.  But no luck.  This place is great.  They're open really late (2AM, IIRC) and are priced just right.  Their menu has any and all Chinese food options at all hours of the night, which is great when you're stumbling home drunk on state street and decide you want Chow Mein.  It may not be the most authentic Chinese food, but it is fantastic food that I can't recomend enough.  It's always quick and courteous and the restaurant itself is very clean and bright.  Gotta love this place!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my search for General's Tofu on par with Asian Kitchen."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I called after waiting an hour and a half and the lady that answered was very rude and inconsiderate. Was not helpful at all. Awful food, awful service. 10/10 do not recommend."}
{"text":"I guess I am on my own here when it comes to bad reviews.  I got the Coconut Shrimp and the Cashew Crusted Chicken, the S1.  It consisted of 6 bland fried coconut shrimp and a thin, fried chicken patty cut in slices that tasted equally bad.  With this being Asian food, this was not what I expected when I ordered this.  Every Asian place that I have ever ordered coconut shrimp, it was fried shrimp in the nice thick white sauce.  As for the cashew chicken, I was expecting at least some kind of sauce.  The only thing saving them from 1 star is the crabmeat rangoons.   I might give them another try, but doubtful.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen is by and large the most dominant Chinese food restaurant in Madison. And with good reason. It's cheap, it's fast, the portions are massive (it always takes me two sittings to finish an order, and I'm a big eater), and most importantly, the food is amazingly good. Any time I want Chinese food, I always order Asian Kitchen.  But being the undisputed king of Madison Chinese has its setbacks for the customer as well. Asian Kitchen knows that their food is as addictive as crack, and that you'll always come back no matter what they do to you. On several occasions, I have ordered my beloved Mongolian Beef or General Tso's Chicken only to find that the meat was so dry that half the food was inedible. And if it weren't for this, Asian Kitchen would easily take all 5 stars for me. But unfortunately, ordering and actually getting the great food they're so famous for is increasingly becoming a shot in the dark."}
{"text":"Pretty much the Asian version of Ian's Pizza, to be honest.   Opens up late, cheap food and disgustingly filling.  Not the best American Chinese I've ever had, but gets the job done."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from Asian Kitchen several times. (I've never actually been to the restaurant itself.)  The ordering process is pretty straight-forward. There are a lot of options to choose from. What I really like is that if I spend over X amount, they throw in a 'free' dish. So for example if I spend over $10, I get a 'free' eggroll, over $15, it's 'free' crabmeat rangoons, and over $20 gets me 'free' fried rice. I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The delivery itself has been pretty hit and miss. We've had it arrive in less than 1/2 hour, 1/2 hour after they said it would be delivered, and one driver blocked other users from using the driveway/garage while he searched for our house.  Some of the dishes I have found to be exceptional. The fried dumplings are excellent! The Singapore Mai Fun is so flavorful, I always order it and I feel like the portion size is huge. We recently tried the Curry Beef and although very greasy, the flavors were dynamite. I'm not a big fan of sweet and sour chicken but I was pleasantly surprised w/the texture of Asian Kitchen's. It wasn't too puffy or bready. The coating was more like a Chicken McNugget while the meat was white and tender. The salt and pepper calamari was perfectly cooked although I felt like it could use more sauce and had too many onions. The sauce on the shumai was good but I prefer the texture and size of the dumplings. The pad-thai I found a mite bland. The seaweed salad had great flavors but tiny portion size. We tend to keep ordering the dishes we love and trying new ones. They have all been at least OK and some have been great.  We'll definitely keep ordering from Asian Kitchen. It's convenient and tasty."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Chinese in Madison. I have really high standards for Chinese food and this place lives up to them!  Also, it's great for the college budget. One order is easily two meals, maybe three!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food at around 10:20pm. I said very specifically in the note, that I would like someone to deliver the food to my room because my friend took my room key. Someone called me at 11:30pm and I explained to him again that I couldn't come downstairs and I expected him to deliver the food directly to me. However, at 0:30am I still haven't got my food. I called back and they told me my food was put at front desk. Did I not specify my requirement in the notes, or did I not explain my situation in the phone? I don't know what happened. I've waited my food for two hours and now it's all cold."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for cheap, delivery asian cuisine, this is where I turn to... Now, I haven't tried much on the menu... The vegetable lo mein was very boring, as were their eggrolls but the General Tso's tofu... fricken brilliant!  We ordered that the first time we tried Asian Kitchen and have not strayed from that dish yet.  It is about $7 and enough to feed my bf and I, and we can really put down some food. Hopefully I will get the balls to try something else soon, but this dish is so darn good!"}
{"text":"The kid who delivers in that Del Sol is the worst part of this establishment. I don't know why he revs it so much, it sounds so bad.... too high pitched. He makes Vtec sound so horrible :( #SayNoToRice"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to late night food places on campus. It's cheap, the portions are huge, and its fast. There's a lot of variety to choose from on the menu. I'm a fan of the general tao's chicken and orange chicken, and the beef dishes are really good as well (but you get more meat with the chicken ones). The soups that come with the lunch/dinner specials are just ok, but the crab rangoon is very greasy and good. Overall, its good, cheap americanized chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Red Thai Curry for $10. Was excellent. Spice level was perfect.   Also veggie pad Thai. Really great. Next time I might order extra peanuts $7  My daughter got broccoli chicken. She said it was 5/5 and only $5  Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"This place is undeniably the worst Asian restaurant in the city of Madison. Used to eat here because of the cheap price and large portion sizes (on a college budget). Poor customer service, they almost always get the orders wrong, and the one time they got my order correct they gave me food poisoning. Avoid this establishment like the plague."}
{"text":"While the price may lure you in, food poisoning will certainly keep you away. Basically don't get anything after 10 PM that isn't deep fried or you'll run the risk of getting a sloppily cooked, half-raw pile of poison."}
{"text":"I never had an issue with Asian Kitchen in all of my orders before-food was consistently excellent, fast delivery, etc! However this evening, I found an insect in our food which was absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately they have lost a customer."}
{"text":"We ordered two lunch specials for delivery and it took TWO HOURS for it to be delivered.  I called three times and kept getting told they would be there soon.  That's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen is definitely my go-to place for quick and cheap Chinese food - especially when those late night hunger pains creep up during exam time - or after nights of drunken debauchery - (they deliver until midnight most days and 3 am Thursday-Saturday!).     General Tso's tofu is one of my favorites and the chicken version isn't bad either.  The chicken lo mein is super greasy but good nonetheless. The \"bubble tea\" drinks are, at most, okay. They're more like super sweetened fruit slushies.    The food is cheap and come in huge portions. I usually get three servings out of whatever I order. The service is okay, could probably be better, but you get your food pretty quickly.  Overall all, I like AK - it's the epitome of what American Chinese take-out is - and enjoy it most in the comforts of College Library."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 items, each of which was $3.99. Not many places have $3.99 specials anymore, especially ones that can fill you up.  Had: Shredded pork and pickled veg vermicelli in soup - Not much pork or pickled veg. Lots of bean sprouts. Crazy ton of vermicelli. Very mild tasting. Beef soy sauce hor fun (dry fried hor fun in Cantonese) - Looked a tad too burnt, but other than that, good sized portion. Shredded pork fried noodles - (meat shred chow mein in Canto) - Noodles were crispy. Once again, a ton of sprouts and not much shredded pork.  What can I say? For $3.99, you get a decent meal, but don't expect 5 star quality food for that price."}
{"text":"It's great to have a diet menu.  The veggies were fresh and delicious, but the sauce was a little bland, watery and sweet.  If you are going to do diet, you have to use garlic, maybe some hot sauce to spice it up."}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai... Was amazing and delicious flavor! The rest of the family had chicken fried rice, the seafood combo and crab rangoons. All in all it was delicious, more than enough for left overs and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I recently found out about the Asian Kitchen from my kids. Aside from pizza this is their favorite take out and mine too! I worked at a Thai /Korean restaurant in the past and found that their curry dishes were just as good! The kids love the sweet and sour chicken. I tried the pad thai but wasn't crazy about it. Also wish they had peanut sauce but they weren't at all familiar with it.   Although I was disappointed that the restroom opened directly to the dining room it is very clean!   It was a very pleasant surprise to find this restaurant so far outside the city!"}
{"text":"Great curry chicken fried rice! The owner lady is really nice and she was quick with the service too. Quick and affordable food stop. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen has one dish that I will keep coming back to:  Crispy Duck  It is so good, the sauce they serve with it is great, and they give a portion large enough for two people to share.    I don't think I have had anything else on their menu, it is Crispy Duck all the way."}
{"text":"This is me every time i've gone to Asian Kitchen:  I'm always quite drunk on a Friday or Saturday night, and want to get some food that would hit the spot.  I think \"hmm, Asian food would do it!\", so I head to Asian kitchen.  The line is usually to the door by this point, as every other drunk kid is thinking the same thing.  Cut to like 25 minutes later (it feels longer), and I'm ordering my tofu deep fried in general tso's/kung pao/orange/whatever sauce.  Another 10 (yet again, feels longer) minutes later, I have my styrofoam container, walk home, get in bed, and open my food.  I dig in, and I'm having pure bliss/euphoria.  2 minutes later, I fall asleep, sometimes with the fork still in my mouth.  Fast forward to 10-11 AM the next day:  I wake up, see that my food is still there.  I finish it, and think \"Ehhhh, this isn't very good\"  And that's Asian Kitchen in a nutshell for me.  It's perfect for late night/drunk munchies, and pretty meh at every other time/state of mind.  During the day, you're better off going to other places on State like Fugu, or Himal Chuli.  But, since those aren't open late, Asian Kitchen has it's niche purpose."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, tons of food, but terrible tasting"}
{"text":"Fu Manchu and Bruce Lee and Formosa and Xanadu and The Kama Sutra all came from Asia. Asia is foreign and mysterious and amazing. Nothing about this place is exciting. This is Chinese American food via American Industrialism. You can go to any college town and find a restaurant exactly like this. This isn't not going to be what you expect.  The portions used to be larger. There used to be less flies in the takeout area. I swear it was cleaner when I was in undergrad. The crab rangoon is expensive. I kinda respect them for overcharging college students for this.  Fugu and Shabu Shabu are both within a block. Both serve better Chinese American food. They both also serve Szechuan. They also both have hot pot. One is pretty and the other is weird. Both are more interesting than Asian Kitchen.  Step up your game, Asian Kitchen. You used to be kinda punk rock. But now you're just old and boring."}
{"text":"Good food but delivery people are rude and refuse to come to the door, but yet they charge a delivery fee"}
{"text":"Decided to stop off at Silverstar Plaza for a late bite after an exhausting day!  at this point our family was desperate for food to find on a sunday night, and YA! I decided to order the Beef Fried rice which was \"meh, ive experienced better\"  it felts a bit mushy, and the only good thing was the tofu drink which helped everything go down easy! My brother had the porkchop w/ rice which was more bone than...pork.  Then there was the egg noodle with beef and chinese broccoli which seemed to barely have beef and greens and more noodle.  It was overly crunchy, but enough to fill our tummies.  Definitely a 2/5 overall! wont be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"A year later and I'm updating my review. Ordered Kung Pao Chicken w steamed rice and Beef Lo Mein. Order delivered in probably 40min. Food was steaming/hot. There was labels on both containers of white rice and lo mein. No complaints on the delivery guy. The beef lo mein was 3 stars.. it was ok. Don't recommend. The Kung Pao Chicken was 5 stars, really good. I would absolutely recommend. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised w this order. Not sure if this is me getting lucky or if they're starting to become consistent now but if I need affordable Asian food delivered, I'll order here again (but probably only chicken dishes)."}
{"text":"For what it is - quick to order Chinese Food - it's pretty darn good. The food is always filling;even when I eat there, I usually have enough to bring home. In fact, for a while I decided to save money by getting one of their larger meals and eating it over 3 meals at home, maybe adding some more rice and vegetables after each meal... but I digress.   Anyway, the food is good, and they also have something called \"Bubble Tea\", which is a smoothie-type tea drink with tapioca pearls. It's kinda interesting and worth a try. The one disadvantage is that the place is small, so you may have more luck just ordering your food to go (although that's what most people do anyway, so finding a seat isn't always tough). Nonetheless, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen is probably the best delivery American-Chinese place Madison has to offer. While China A8 is nice and all and offers really, really nice deals for students--I personally find their food to be a little bland and that's why I mostly prefer Asian Kitchen.  I haven't experienced a whole lot from their menu--mostly either Orange Chicken or General Tso's Chicken. Both of the chicken dishes, when done right, offer a really, really sweet and slightly spicy taste. The General Tso's Chicken, in particular, has red pepper flakes in the sauce which adds a really nice kick. However, it always happens where you get overcooked chicken that makes it crunchy and almost impossible to eat--and as a result, I can't justify giving Asian Kitchen 4 stars.  When I've come to sit in at the restaurant, I have to be honest: it is the nastiest place. There is a lot of sticky tables and the bathrooms are horrendous; I've seen cockroaches and the toilets are almost never clean everytime I've been there. But that's why I typically only order from here for delivery. (I realize the cockroaches should bother me, but I'm adventurous and I'm going to assume they're going to get cooked if they land in my food anyways--more protein that way.)  It's great, cheap, and delicious--what more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh General Tso's pan-Asian delight. A solid three stars. The place isn't very clean, but i've never had a problem with the food in nearly 10 years of drunk late-night food runs, mid-day lunch and glorious returns to Madison. Eat up and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their food here is strictly circumstantial. This is an absolute truth. Its a takeout place, so don't expect fancy lighting and leather seats. The food is good only if you're: in the mood for greasy as hell takeout; looking for cheap food cause you're broke; or near piss drunk, which I was when I had it. Running in drunk from the bars at 2am, I ordered an extra spicy lo mein and it was phenomenal. They made damn sure it was spicy enough to make tums my best friend the next day and the greasy flavor of the lo mein was enhanced tenfold by the jager bombs I had earlier. I refused to puke anytime after that because it was so good, but mostly because I was afraid of the burning inferno that I would shoot up my esophagus. I will never come here sober but it is a favorite when I'm wasted out of my mind."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, large quantities.  Alway get lunches.  Broccoli/Beef, General Tso, Sweet and Sour chicken, Egg Rolls, Wonton soup, hot and sour soup.  Super fast service.  Always friendly.  Recommend to all."}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot to say about the restaurant in general, but the Subgum Fried Rice from Asian Kitchen is honestly the best fried rice I have ever had in my entire life.  The taste is smooth and buttery with the right amount of salty meats (which are actually good quality it seems!) mixed in. No soy sauce necessary, which is rare for me when it comes to eating takeout/delivery rice.    I come up to Madison from Chicago every couple of months and ordering Asian Kitchen late at night has become standard operating procedure for me -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Its good food, large portions.  Other chinese restaurants in the area werent so welcoming. Their staff is friendly, the food is prepared quickly. Definitely one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"Americanized and greasy, sure, but the portions are huge and the prices are low.  I love the fried chicken, wonton soups, egg foo young with shrimp, and the vegetables are always crispy and fresh.  One of my favorite places in Madison to get fast food that will last at least 2 meals for the price of one!"}
{"text":"Hunger can make you do strange things. Like going somewhere to eat where all the subtle signs are actually red flags telling you to stay hungry a little longer and roll the dice elsewhere.  Admittedly, my entre choice of chicken egg foo young was not one I would normally select, especially when at this place you could substitute \"yuck\" in place of young. To say that the flavor profile was monochromatic would be charitable, and the dark brown sauce it was swimming in was salty enough to float a tourist in the Dead Sea. My chosen side dish of seaweed salad was actually partially frozen.  Perhaps they were trying to invent a new savory Asian popsicle.  Did I mention the uninterrupted screaming in Chinese from the kitchen during my entire visit?  Endpoint lesson learned-you still get what you pay for, and if your instinct tells you to move on before dropping your cash like it's hot, follow your instinct."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, quick and delicious. This isn't high quality but it's one of the better cheap Chinese places."}
{"text":"I had thai shrimp dumplings and Malaysian satay beef. The dumplings were steamed and full of shrimp and scallions. They were great with the dipping sauce. The Malaysian beef had some good heat, the satay sauce was delicious! Place was busy, service was still pretty good. If you like a lot of spice, you'll want to request more heat in the satay sauce. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very relaxed atmosphere.  Its a pretty good value with large portion sizes.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"I like to think of this place as a secret lunch weapon.  It's small, grubby, and not very visible from the street.   The food is really great, and they are unbelievably quick about preparing it. Bonus points for using liberal amounts of hot pepper in spicy dishes when requested. I can take it!  Extremely inexpensive, too."}
{"text":"Best drunk food on campus hands down. I always take my visiting friends here after a night of drinking. Asian kitchen never fails to disappoint. They always want to go back for lunch or the next night if they don't finish all their leftovers!"}
{"text":"Until about a year ago, if you had a late night craving for Chinese you were effed.  Then Asian Kitchen burst on to the scene and now drunks and insomniac shut-ins alike can bask their greasy splendor.  They have convenient on-line ordering and most items are ready for pick up in about 10 minutes or less.  Their hot and sour soup is quite tasty and the crab rangoon is very rich-- it has chunks of cream cheese in it and minimal crab. At the actual restaurant, there isn't very much seating room and the bright yellow interior isn't easy on the eyes.  In general the food is the same as every other Midwestern Chinese restaurant, it's not stunning, but the hours and speediness warrants 3 stars."}
{"text":"Your dollar will not go farther in Madison than here. There was a period of negative of reviews that I cannot argue with...I came back about 2 years ago and expectations were not met. But those days are long gone! Asian Kitchen is back in its prime.  Lunch specials are the best deal possibly in the whole city. I highly recommend them. I always do pick-up (less hassle) and have never had any trouble with my order, items, or anything else.   The portions are outstanding and they will cater to individual requests. General tso's too sweet? Ask for it extra spicy! They'll modify.   They also seem to be adding more vegetables to many of the dishes and diversifying the offerings.  We had the Mongolian beef, General Tso's Tofu (spicy), and Moo Shu Pork - all I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is such an eyesore.  They specialize in takeout, and the aesthetics of the restaurant itself say this, loudly.  The way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness.    When I get that craving for Sesame tofu, I like that Asian Kitchen will make three meal's worth of it, in ten minutes or less, for under seven bucks, without sacrificing taste.  I have only had the tofu dishes, and that seems to be the prime choice here.  I haven't found tofu cooked this crispy anywhere else.  It's crammed into a Styrofoam carton with an appropriately massive amount of rice and a couple obligatory pieces of broccoli buried underneath everything else.  The broccoli is soggy, but I've had much worse, and I don't go to Asian Kitchen for the broccoli anyway.  It's an ugly little hole in the wall that provides wonderfully greasy food in ridiculous portions for cheap.  It may not be fine dining, but Asian Kitchen excels where it counts."}
{"text":"\"Healthy Diet Menu\" that ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD.  Chinese is my go-to meal after being out of town (which I am frequently) and I decided to try the less-greasy alternatives on Asian Kitchen's \"Healthy Diet Menu\" last night.  I was very pleased with what I got. Now mind you, it is food that does not have any oil, sugar, salt or added fats, so we're not talking the usual, rub-it-on-my-thighs-because-it's-going-to-end-up-there-anyway Chinese food experience. I ordered the Chicken and Broccoli and steamed dumplings. I've had the steamed dumplings before and they are fairly authentic steamed dumplings. A friend from China taught me to make them a few years ago, and they're pretty close to hers. The chicken and broccoli order was HUGE (it'll be AT LEAST two more meals) and looked gorgeous. A few carrots for color, and the brown sauce it comes with is just salty enough to punch it up, but not to give that salted-snail feeling that a lot of Chinese food seems to give me. They also give it to you on the side so seasoning is at your discretion.  I'll definitely be ordering again and again. Nice to have a late-night food option that isn't so calorie-dense."}
{"text":"Asian Kitchen is a classic I'll be sad to leave. Their tofu is often perfectly chewy & crispy (although sometimes overlooked or burned, not enough to lower my rating). as a vegetarian i appreciate the options.  most importantly, the staff are endlessly patient and polite. Tina, who is often there when i go, is so patient even when dealing with the worst customers. she is so sweet and patient and deserves all the best.   the lo mein is excellent. highly recommend mixed veggies with tofu and sesame tofu."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE Chinese place in Madison. I always get the General Tso's fried tofu with egg fried rice and fried dumplings and it is so delicious. I eat here like, once a week. 9/10 times our delivery is there within 30 minutes. It's not very expensive and they have the BEST coupons ever.  You legit get a free order of Sweet and Sour chicken if you buy $25 worth of food.  I love this place. I crave it. I want to live there. I have some leftovers in my fridge right now, not gonna lie.  Eat here."}
{"text":"If I want cheap late night food--Asian Kitchen is my best friend. It's affordable, pretty tasty and delivers (which is a must). I've always had good experiences with delivery, in fact they always come faster than I expect. I used to eat chicken so those were my go to dishes, but now I've cut down to just fish. I still prefer their fried tofu dishes over their shrimp ones -- the tofu is always cooked well. It's obviously not authentic Chinese food and definitely not the healthiest option, so if that's what you're looking for, I would not recommend Asian Kitchen. But if you're in the mood for some decent fried rice and crab rangoon, I'd give it a try."}
{"text":"Have ordered noodle dishes which contain an unacceptably small amount of noodles. They also do not read anything in the comments. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"$3.99 all day specials.. no judgement please.  Every time when I have to order from Asian Kitchen, I feel overwhelmed! Too many choices?? Maybe I should just go down their $3.99 specials and try out every single item for the next 22 days... then I don't have to think what I should have for lunch?  Beef Brisket Vermicelli in Soup ($3.99) with Soy Bean Drink or Soup of the Day, at the price I am not complaining. Tons of vegetables on the side. Portion may be a little small for some, but great as a light lunch or snacks.  If you really want to be full, then try one of the rice dishes... or they have $4.75 or $5.99 specials too!"}
{"text":"I would give them no stars but in order to have a review you need one.  Horrible service and messed up orders.  1st time I ordered they took over an hour and a half and that was calling to check where the food was.  2nd time I ordered they forgot the cashew chicken and told me I never ordered it. And would not replace the order. They also took almost an hour to deliver the food.  They lost my business."}
{"text":"This place satisfies the ethanol-ridden population of Madison at bar close. Service is what's to be expected at 2 in the morning. Their fried rice is okay. I give it some stars because their General Tso's Chicken has great crisp to it!"}
{"text":"Terrible egg rolls form the majority of my opinion on this establishment. I ordered delivery and got pork with mixed veggies, a chicken egg roll, and crabmeat rangoons.  In my delivery bag, I had two rolls. I don't know which was which. One was smaller than the other, but they had similar textures and coatings, so it didn't seem as though one was supposed to be a spring roll or something. Regardless, they both were nasty. It's not too often I can't finish a food, but I ended up eating half of each roll and then throwing them away. I was like, why the heck am I even eating this?  The pork was decent, but it's not something I couldn't get at literally any other place in Madison. The rangoons were OK, as well--different: rectangular--but I'm not a fan of the red sweet & sour. I was disappointed there weren't any included packets of sweet & sour, and although it was a prepackaged good, the duck sauce tasted fowl (play on words, purposely misspelled!), so I didn't have a sauce worth dipping in for any of the fried goods.  In a pinch, I would maybe get an entree again, but I think I'd stay clear of the apps."}
{"text":"This was my go-to late night option for my first few years in Madison. Having lived in a place with no late night chinese, I couldn't help myself. Huge portions and hits the spot for greasy chinese that soaks up (and makes you drink a ton of water) any drinks you had that night.   I usually ordered the Mongolian Beef, but the Kung Pao chicken is also good.   Also a good idea to get this carryout and take it to the terrace to eat with a cold beer in the summer."}
{"text":"When Jackie and Leilei owned this place Asian Kitchen rocked my socks off. Now it's just OK. Fortunately, they still make a mean General Tso's Tofu, I must say.  Also, the full entrees are gigantic for the price. Highly recommended if you're going to pay for a Dinner Combo--just make the upgrade, it's worth the extra pound of food you get."}
{"text":"Amazing for drunken nights but if you are coherent I would avoid it.. Kind of tastes like dog food at times. Great crab Rangoon and fried rice."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the ultimate greasy Asian food indulgence, do what I did and order the peanut butter fried chicken. Yes, you read that right. The dish combines two of my favorite foods, peanut butter and chicken, and deep fries them. What's not to love.   I've been a longtime fan of the peanut chicken at QQ Express just down the street. When I saw that Asian kitchen had a variation of the same dish, I knew it had to be tried. While the peanut chicken at Asian Kitchen falls short of my beloved version at QQ, you can't beat the location, speedy service, and large portions."}
{"text":"Not as good as QQ Express, but they deliver and are open late.  Not much for sitting room."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until I made a delivery order once and please please take note of this: THE DELIVERY DRIVER STOLE MONEY FROM ME. I made the mistake of not filling in the tip amount when I signed the receipt because I gave him a tip in cash.  So what did he do? Filled in the tip and changed the total amount.  Granted, it wasn't a large amount of money but I am a poor college student and was thoroughly pissed off.  I went to talk to management about it and they did absolutely nothing. They did not even believe me even when you could see how he made my 2 into a 7 on the receipt.  I have never experienced such terrible customer service.  It has been over two years and I still refuse to go there.  They've probably lost a lot of money on me because I used to order there quite a bit before this incident so that's their loss.  Definitely not a classy place. Not missing it a bit - the food is not even very good."}
{"text":"Today will be my last day ordering food from them. While it was only a 5 minute walk to deliver, it's been one hour and we're still waiting for our food. The man on the phone didn't help at all. He only can give this answer: well, it's on its way and we don't  know what to tell you.  Go page your driver! And ask where the h*** he is!"}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken as well as the sweet and sour chicken. Portions are pretty large which is great. The chicken isn't soggy it's nice and crunchy. Really happy with my meal. Would recommend to others."}
