{"text":"Great owners and space. Great coffee too. Much prefer this cafe for good coffee and/or Italian sodas than many other nhood spots.  It's a great place for a casual meeting also."}
{"text":"It is a nice place in the neighborhood to have a cup of coffee. I went there twice. In both times, I went for appointments and arrive in the area too early. I wanted to kill my time and found the coffee shops. It is a nice place to do some work quietly. Coffee was okay. Small size coffee costs $2.00, but by considering the area, probably it is reasonable."}
{"text":"Oscar's is one of the nicest caf√©s in the Beaches. With sweets that aren't numbingly sweet, coffee that's been meticulously brewed and a quaint atmosphere, it has many fine qualities that set a high standard for other Beaches businesses.  The prices are similar to other places in the Beaches, but the top notch service and well-thought out interior makes it a wonderful place to sit down for a cup of any beverage you like. The free wifi and patio are also great bonuses. As other users have said, the pastry collection is a tad bit small; however, for a shop of its size it has enough options to satisfy almost any pastry fan.  I cannot wait to see how it evolves and grows, and I hope to continue my patronage there for a great many years. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First of all, great coffee! Very comfortable atmosphere and plenty of seating available. This place also has a nice patio which is a plus during the warmer months. Highly recommended coffee place in the Beaches neighbourhood. Grab a cup and take a walk along the beach!"}
{"text":"Time for an update!   Oscar has been around now long enough for me to know all the good there is with it. This is a true gem of a coffee shop, in the Beaches and anywhere else the owners would choose to take their business.   The coffee has always been good, the place clean and the owners go out of their way to ensure we get good service and great drinks. The reason this place now gets a five star is because of all the options added in terms of pastries and sweets. There's no lack of options and it's clear that the staff and owners listen to the customers.   An amazing place and with a cute little patio located in the further east end of the Beaches. Definitely worth a visit (or several)! :)"}
{"text":"I love what the owners did with this place. It has a modern cozy atmosphere. Yummy desserts and hot chocolate. Free wi-fi, good music and staff is super friendly. I haven't tried the sandwiches yet but they look fresh and good. The place looks spotless and clean which for me is an excellent sign. I'm looking forward to trying the sandwiches. A welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 4:45pm. Not crowded at all. Great for quiet reading or studying. I got a black tea so I can't speak to the coffee or espresso. The gentleman working there was nice. The bathroom is downstairs. Didn't have actual food, but did have some bakery items."}
{"text":"Had to write the review while at Oscar myself! Best cappuccinos EVER - you have to try them. They make their drinks with a lot of care and the baristas are always so kind and smiley. They play relaxing jazz and the cafe never is too loud to get a decent study hour or more in. Wish I took a picture of the cappuccino heart art but I couldn't resist diving in!"}
{"text":"This place is great for studying or doing some work. It isn't a large coffee shop, but there is adequate seating of different varieties. It usually isn't too busy, and even when it gets busier there is faint classic music playing, which gives a nice even ambiance. It is somewhat dark inside, but not unpleasantly so, actually quite intimate if you want to have a conversation with someone over coffee. The coffee is quite good, go in for the espresso based drinks, it's called an espresso bar for a reason. The staff is always pleasant and friendly. Hours could be extended to compete with some other coffee shops which stay open later. Baked good selection could also be a little bit better. Hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"This family understands what it means to take pride in their business! Amazing coffee!!! Great atmosphere! And amazing people! I think that everyone should check them out! And what better way to start your morning then ordering a coffee made to perfection and listening to the soothing sounds of classical music!! BEST COFFEE house in the beach!!"}
{"text":"Yes the coffee was very rich and flavorful but their muffins were bland, white and not too healthy. If these guys want to get some of the Remarkable Bean's customers, then it is high time that they get some high quality pastries and dense, packed with fruit and nuts muffins!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood coffee house! I discovered this lovely spot recently & it's become one of my faves. The coffee is excellent and the selection of pastries is also excellent. A short walk from the Beaches boardwalk, Oscar also features free wifi!"}
{"text":"Oscar Coffee & Espresso Bar has a nice set up. Love those sofa like booth at the back. Chilling at the back just feel like lounging at a friend's house.  On a Sunny Spring Sunday afternoon, Oscar was busy but the line moved fast. My Cappuccino has really nice milk froth, smooth and silky. I should have ordered a double shot of espresso as it is just too mellow for my liking.  I would definitely be back to Oscar when I am in the neighbourhood."}
