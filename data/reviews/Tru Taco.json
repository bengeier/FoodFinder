{"text":"Probably the worst food I've had in Charlotte. Greasy tacos (oil slick greasy) and worst chips ever! How do you not have good chips at a taco joint? Workers were rude and disinterested.  Never again."}
{"text":"Their bowls are super good. The corn tacos aren't. Go for the bowls. Get the potbelly and Mexican rice, you fool! They have every sauce imaginable to top it with and they have Horchata! In the top 3 food options in the Overstreet Mall for sure."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of trying this place today instead of going to Salsarita's. The only reason they get 2 stars from me is because the staff were friendly. Other than that, nothing stood out. The chicken is pretty bland, they are very stingy on the queso, guacamole is an up-charge (free at Salsarita's), and all around not as good/flavorful. Was really hoping for good things from this place, but I feel it's probably not going to last, just like what happened to Brad's."}
{"text":"You won't go wrong here. Everything  is made fresh daily. Great flavors, great food and cool concept. There are endless combinations for a great price. I got a Vegan bowl and it was great. Jasmine rice, black beans, topped  with all types of fresh vegetables  and scoop of fresh made guacamole. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this new edition to Overstreet mall for lunch today after seeing the long lines last week. The staff was friendly and helpful. Since I love both tacos and Asian food, I went with the Sure Bet tacos. The brisket was perfectly cooked! I ate them so fast that I didn't have a chance to take a pic. The portion size was average as you get 3 of the smaller tacos. The only downside is that you can't mix and match the type of tacos in your order. In addition to the standard drinks they offered Horchata, Tamarindo, and Hibiscus tea. I chose the hibiscus tea and it was very refreshing. With so many options to choose from, I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Quick recap: if you want a different vibe of \"Mexican\" burrito spots this is it. It's more authentic than almost anything downtown with the option of getting some Chinese flavors. 

This place used to be brads sand which shop so the layout is similar but the menu couldn't be any more different. 

Overall this is a good thing as they put powerfully flavorful meats for you to choose from. They kept the menu fairly simple and added some recommendations on how to mix up your dishes. 

The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable when it comes to the eats. The drinks however are a bit pricy. 

The I had a bowl with rice beans pork cheese cactus and pickled onions. Everything was on point but I will admit the mole sauce was a bit salty and the pickled onions a little too strong. Besides that it was delicious. 

I strongly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Got the \"el general\" bowl. I must say, it was soooooo good! I was very surprised, as I expected Qdoba type bowl. Nope, it tasted very authentic :) will go back and try the Asian dish next time.

Must say though, the Horchata nor the hibiscus juice, not good at all. They really need to fix that."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Tru Taco.  It's close to where I work and I love this type of food normally.  When it first opened, lines were consistently around the corner, almost to Freshii.  Now, not so much.  I'm not sure if the \"newness\" has worn off or what (fickle uptown lunchers!)

On to the food.  The first time I tried Tru Taco, I had a salad with chicken and fixings on it; simple enough.  Well, the people working there were really pushing for you to point at the names of the toppings, etc. on the glass instead of telling them what you want.  This was weird to me.  Why can't I just say \"pickled onions, please\"?  The salad was pretty good, so I told my coworkers I'd give it another shot. 

We went down there earlier this week, for my second try, and I had a bowl with Spanish rice, black beans, chicken and fixings.  No pointing; I was allowed to ask for what I wanted.  That was a plus.  I noticed a little bit of a tummy grumble after my first visit, but I thought it was nothing.  I don't normally have digestive issues.  After eating half of my rice bowl, the familiar grumble was back and I stopped eating.  Who knows what the problem is.  Something they cook the chicken with, maybe? 

I also take issue with joints like this not giving up the chips for free.  Come on, chips are super cheap.  You can purchase them, though, with chips/salsa or chips/guac for several dollars more."}
{"text":"Love the El General 
Cactus salad, pickled red onions and mole sauce! So good.  It's a splurge tho..."}
{"text":"A trendy and unique looking restaurant resting in one of the corners of the Overstreet Mall in uptown. TRU taco is similar to the setup you'll find at a Moe's or a Chipotle. However unlike Chipotle, they offer a TON of options ranging from proteins, sauces, toppings, dressings, etc for your tacos, burrito, burrito bowl etc. etc!

I'm writing this review after my second visit here. This time I got the Brisket burrito bowl with jasmine rice, Korean BBQ seasoning, crema, peanuts, pico, and a sweet chili sauce. Brisket was moist, tender, and full of flavor. It is VERY east to dry out brisket so I'm so glad I got it!!

Last time I was here I got a similar setup except for Pork Belly instead of Brisket. It seems like pork belly is 'in' right now, a lot of places are putting it on the menu. This was my first experience with pork belly. I'm not going to ding them for it, because maybe it's just how it's supposed to be, but is pork belly just supposed to taste like fat? Not much meat, and I paid a premium price compared to all the other protein options. Like I said, maybe I'm just out of touch! I'll stick with traditional proteins on my next visit.

All in all, a great little gem tucked away where the vast majority of uptown visitors will never see! If you're reading this and looking for something in uptown for lunch, definitely consider TRU Taco!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Tru Taco, I love the concept and the variety of ingredients. I got a burrito bowl and my husband got the steamed buns. The price depends on the meat you pick, and we both got pork belly. While I had a huge bowl of food, my husband only got 3 tiny buns with a small amount of fillings in each..for around $9. I feel that the buns and tacos should either come disassembled, so that you get the same amount of toppings as a bowl, or these should be served with a small side. The pork belly was also chopped pretty fine and didn't really taste like pork belly. 

While the toppings were really good, there were SO many. Honestly, this should be reduced. I appreciate variety more than anyone, but there was just too much going on. Not to mention you feel so rushed/overwhelmed making your decisions. I agree with what a previous reviewer said, that there should be cards where you mark your selections and then hand it to the person behind the glass...this would make things much easier. There are a few things that need to be tweaked, as there are with any new business, but I think they have a solid concept, I hope they can realize its true potential."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 1:30pm and they were out of Mexican rice and chicken. How does a taco place run out of Mexican rice and chicken? I'll wait to the newness wears off before I try again. First impression.....not impressed!"}
{"text":"I hit this place twice in one week and I have to tell you it was yummy both times. I must admit that I was very confused on my first trip as there are so many selections. They do offer some suggested crowd favorites but I felt adventurous and tried the tacos on trip one with beef, Korean sauce and slaw. On the 2nd trip I went for the bowl with jasmine rice, black beans, pork belly, queso and corn salsa. Needless to say I'm full as a tick! 


Everything is freshly and the staff is very friendly and patient. They even helped me both times make some hard choices. This may become my new go to spot"}
{"text":"So after reading a Charlotte Agenda article that a new choice for us Uptown workers was coming to Overstreet Mall, I was very excited. The menu sounded great and the first week the line was at Freshii. I finally was able to get into a line that was not almost into the parking deck and was moving fairly quickly. I went with the Miss Piggy bowl. The portion was a good size but I felt like my bowl needed more ingredients but I really did not know what else to add. I felt like there was a lot of good topping choices but nothing that really wowed me. I will definitely try this place again and try a Mexican entr√©e."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try Tru Taco after reading some of the reviews, but I'm so glad I did. A couple of coworkers and I got there right at noon on a Friday, and while there were already about 10 people in line, it moved fast. There was also a staff person handing out menus and free samples of chips and guac; I didn't try it since it was a little too \"Contagion\" for me, but I appreciated the sentiment.

I got the El General bowl with chicken, Mexican rice, black beans, cactus salad, and mole, and the chicken was tender. The kicker was the pickled onions, which gave the bowl just enough acid. 

There's pretty ample seating for an uptown place in Overstreet Mall, but it was still a little tricky to find seating for three people - there are a lot of two-tops. That's the only reason I couldn't go a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tasted so good, but within 5 hours I was throwing up. A delicious burrito bowl not worth being horribly sick for 24 hours. There is always a chance I got sick coincidentally, but I think it was food poisoning... eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"Stopped by for cinco de mayo and all I can say is yum! Hard to pin point but I think the crema is totally tasty. I went purely Mexican because of the holiday but I'm excited to try the fusion flavored. Great addition to overstreet!"}
{"text":"fun concept, good variety, solid quality of food but very rushed that its hard to do a custom order without missing stuff I want.  Staff was friendly and payment is quick and easy.  The price point is just about right for uptown.  Advice to ownership - slow it down to allow customers a chance to pick everything they want or open up an additional lane."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ordering can be stressful but I just go down the line and choose something from each section that looks good to me - as opposed to planning out the whole bowl at the beginning. I mix the flavors between Mexican and Korean/Asian and have never been disappointed. 

I'd eat here 4x a week if I didn't mind spending the money. 

Makes great leftovers too."}
{"text":"The food was good and the flavoring was really good. So why 3 stars? The tacos were so small, almost like baby tacos. I ordered 3 flour tacos and by the time the rice and beans were on there, they were out of space. I still had 5 more toppings to go. To the point, it was more of a bowl than tacos. After one bite, half of the taco was on my plate. I will say, it's nice to have a place like this that has more than just Mexican. I feel a 4 star rating was too high and a 3 might be too low, however, I will eat here again. Just not going to order the tacos, which is a shame for a place with \"Taco\" in their name. The bowls and nachos that I saw other people had, were looking good too. Not sure why they decided to go so small with the taco size."}
{"text":"Went to Tru Taco for the first time today - the last few restaurants in this location have struggled, but my hope is that Tru Taco stays for a long time.  Met the owner while walking in - he explained the menu which is very simple.  I opted for 3 tacos - beef, pork and pacific cod. All were very good.  My fav was the pork with the korean BBQ sauce on top.  
Great food, service & reasonable prices.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  The food is excellent, and the eclectic choices are even better.  Want Mexican?  Tru Taco has it.  Chinese?  Tru Taco has it.  It's a lot of fun mixing and matching with all of the sauces and toppings.  I can't say I've ever had a burrito bowl with brisket, curry sauce, pickled onions, and chipotle slaw before...and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked meat. Fresh ingredients. Open another location so I can eat on weekends. This place is better than Chipotle and Moe's combined."}
{"text":"My brother and I were in town for a Monday Night Football game and we found this place in one of the buildings downtown.  I ordered three tacos, all different.  The shrimp taco was my least favorite.  The pork one was my favorite although the pork was a lil dry.  The beef was very spicy.  I'd prefer to control the spice level with the salsa, not having it actually cooked into the meat.  All salsas are spicy.  Would like a milder option.  Still a solid spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. This is a great alternative to your typical taco joint. The food is fresh and includes Asian flavors along with Mexican. The place is pretty typical of all the other restaurants in the mall. Service is great, I've never had to wait that long to put my order in. My one complaint is they have no trays to put your food on. If I want to eat there I have to juggle everything like getting silverware, napkins and my drink. I know one of these days my lunch will end up in the floor or another customer. If they fix that I will change it to a 5!"}
{"text":"This place is new! Although a bit early to give a more refined verdict, my initial impression is that it blows Johnny Burrito completely out of the water.

The idea seems to be that they serve both traditional Mexican and Asian-Mex fare here, allowing more variety than your average Chipotle. My burrito bowl with pulled pork came with a generous portion of food, although I did notice that the tacos looked a bit meager/stingy. Burrito bowls seem to be the way to go here, and at the very least there are certainly a lot of topping and ingredients options. Do keep in mind that the mixed flavor palettes introduce a dangerous paradox of choice if you are the type to blindly fill up your bowl...

I went with more traditional Mexican style ingredients and overall enjoyed the quality of the food - my pulled pork was marinated well and all the ingredients seemed fresh, especially the guacamole that tasted like it was worth the extra $1.75. Also, for a place that straddles cuisines (and seems generally less \"authentic\"/\"more corporate\" than say Johnny Burrito), it's nice to see that they have actually have a mole sauce and a few different salsa options.

I haven't tried the Asian-style tacos/buns but it bugs me a bit that they refer to it as a \"Chino\" flavor... I don't care very much from a PC perspective but it seems to me to be as equally influenced by the Korean-Mexican fusion craze that is sweeping the nation.

Overall: it's reasonably priced (at least for the burrito bowl) and there's plenty of variety, even among protein options. I would ignore the \"recommendations\" and go with what you think you'll like."}
{"text":"Went to tru taco on the initial opening week and I was excited for a new place to eat lunch. I was met by the owner  in line who was explaining the menu, seemed friendly along with the staff...the menu looked promising as well with a Mexican - Asian fusion and unique ingredients...but once I got my bowl, it was bland, the rice was not fresh and this is important because its the base of the meal. I was pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Charlotte and was able to try TruTaco and it sure did not disappoint. The flavors are spot on and that pork belly is amazing. The white rice could have been cooked better (I thought it was a bit overcooked). The 2nd time went there, I had the Mexican rice as the base and it was cooked perfectly. The was a lot of selections in terms of topics which was a bit confusing since you feel rushed when making a selection. Other than that, I LOVE IT. I will be coming back to TruTaco."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch with lots of options for what you can add to your bowl. The Asian influence makes all of it more interesting. In my bowl, I had Mexican rice, black beans, veggies (instead of meat), green curry sauce, cheese, guac, corn, lettuce, Asian noodles, and spicy mayo. 

If you come here, definitely be prepared for a heavy meal! Prices are reasonable. Note that they recently changed their name to Zen Taco. Still at the same location though.

{"text":"So many Mexican places are missing flavor, this is not the case at TruTaco. While I love hot spice, very few places get a great mix of heat and flavor. I went back-to-back days and had green curry and then Korean bbq and both mix well with the brisket but are amazing in their own right. The corn salsa isn't quite as good as Chipotle's but has more corn than onions so it's delicious. Queso is extra but they have queso blanco and Colby jack, but with the food bursting with flavor in everything else you may as well just stick with sour cream and cheese than pay more for the queso. The price is comparable to Chipotle and they have more variety so I can't believe I am saying this but they may have met their match. Be adventurous and have the green curry."}
{"text":"cool concept, pretty good food but SO rushed that you can't really do a custom order because you are pushed through the line so quickly. Also if you order one of their recommended options, they are moving so quickly that the tacos are like one big taco blob...not really individual tacos. I had the chino tacos which were great, except I had to eat with a fork. Advice to tru taco - slow it down."}
{"text":"Even though this place replaced my beloved Brad's, I have to say, I am a fan.  In my first pass at this place, I was pretty happy... I know it's still the \"new kid\" on the block, but it seems like they are here to stay.  

First impressions:  They totally kept a lot of the Brad's equipment and just fixed the configuration of the restaurant.  You still move through a line the same direction, but they have replaced the serving table (that used to have the chili and soups) with a large 10-person communal high top.  They also threw around the white, orange, and green... assuming the inspiration was from the Mexican flag with large, bold graphics and a lot of wood paneling.  The tables and chairs are the same, but painted and now there's a circular slot in all the tables that have a large plastic bottle of hot sauce nested in the middle. 

There was a line, but it moves pretty fast and there was (I am assuming) one of the store owners/managers handing out menus to people in the line and explaining the concept.  Basically it is all based on \"Build Your Own\"....  Pick Tacos, Burrito Bowl, Quesadilla, Nachos, Asian Buns, or Salad... Then the base:  either Mexican Rice, Lettuce, Cold Noodles, Jasmine Rice, Pinto Beans, Black Beans, or Chips.... Then your choice of meat:  chicken, pork, pork belly, pacific cod, vegetables, or brisket.  After you get your base and fill... you flavor it... here is where you can go Mexicano or \"Chino\" (their term for Asian).  Then you pretty much can throw so many toppings to your hearts desire... keeping in mind that Guacamole is an upcharge.  Pick your sauce... and you can also add crunchy things to your food at the end of the line...

They do have some pre-assembled tacos and bowls to choose from if you don't want to customize everything.  Add some sides:  chips and salsa, etc and your drink... and you've got lunch.

Overall I was pretty impressed and happy with the bowl I created.  I went the Mexicano route:  Chicken bowl, Mexican rice, black beans, queso (1.00 extra), chipotle slaw, cilantro/onion, Mexican cheese, shredded lettuce, corn salsa, queso fresco, chipotle sauce!

The staffers are friendly and I was sitting in the dining room a while so one of them came by and grabbed my empty bowl and tray to clear my table.  They are pretty quick here with tables bused and the floor clean.  Definitely coming back to see what other custom lunch options are in my future."}
