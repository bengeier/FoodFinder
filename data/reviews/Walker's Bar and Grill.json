{"text":"I LOVE this establishment.  Great beer selection, great selection, entertaining staff.  Oh and good food too.  Give the chili pizza a try for something different."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Mad I have to give 1 star.  The servers are great but management leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Average home town bar! Lots of older (45-55 yrs) men. Cheap drinks. This place would be a great hang out spot if it wasn't for the smoke. Super smoky."}
{"text":"I stopped by Walker's this past Friday for the first time, you could instantly tell it was a hometown bar, but I never felt unwelcome.  The bartender promptly told us the drink specials and offered us a menu, and within minutes, we had our first drink.

Beer:  They had a great offering of different micro brews, but feeling unadventurous that night, I stayed with what they had on tap which they had around 8 different varieties.

Food:  I ordered the Double Bacon Cheeseburger and it was massive.  The burger was a little overcooked, because I like to see blood, but was still very juicy.  It came with any of the usual toppings you would like; I only went with lettuce, tomato, and onion.  The side was a full basket of fries all for around $11, which for the size and amount, was a good deal.  I also got a side order of parmesan wings.  The wings were also very juicy and the flavor was great.   

Pros:  It is very clean.  The service was great and the food hit the mark for the prices. 

Cons:  I am not a smoker and this is a smoking bar.  If you are bothered by smoke, you will not like this place.

Conclusion:  Smoke does not bother me, so I visiting Walker's again in the future.

{"text":"Great wings and onion rings! Salads are very good also, chicken salad is my favorite,  good size and lots of topping. Take out or eat in, very good service either way."}
{"text":"Walker's is a local bar that is very welcoming to anyone.  Great for catching up with friends or to catch a Penguins game!  Bartenders are friendly and funny and the owners are great people."}
