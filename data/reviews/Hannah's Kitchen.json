{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food, great service and amazing prices. I got the bacon eggs Benedict and I'll be going back again soon. So awesome!!"}
{"text":"Very rude and unprofessional staff. They always have the same menu. The manager or the owner is always there and they are extremely rude and unfriendly. I went there few times because it's under my condo and every single time I went there they gave me a different price for the same sandwich that I always get. I asked to speak with them manager and the owner came and said its different price everyday . Lol that's funny and next time I talked to the manager she said they made a mistake and it should be one price. Never going there again cause they all look miserable."}
{"text":"Brunched here on the patio this beautiful sunny morning. Good place to people and dog watch as it is right by Yonge St. Prices are reasonable for the location I suppose. Food was cooked well. I liked how they didn't burn the breakfast sausage and eggs over easy were made just right. Perfect for dipping warm buttered toast in! The grilled tomatoes were different and paired well with breakfast. Tea could have been better though, I like my Earl Grey strong and fragrant. Too much water I think, and I am biased to Twinnings. Staff were friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed my first time here and would come back."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Lots of healthy options, including vegetarian and vegan, and the people there are really nice too!  It's really nice to have an option like this around for lunch or a snack, or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I went there for the patio. It is a great location. But the order take a lot of time to be served and while waiting for quite sometime we were told that they ran out of some the sides that we ordered. When the food finally arrived it was pretty tasteless and bland. It didn't feel special at all, I can make better burgers at home. They need to improve their service and food."}
{"text":"This gem of a place is a popular go-to at lunch time for those working in the Yonge & Eglinton area.  With fresh & delicious daily specials to entice anyone's taste buds, I find myself here on a weekly basis for lunch.  Hannah's daily specials include a few option for soups, pasta dish and two 'main' dishes.  I usually get half size soup and half size pasta or a salad.  The soups here are AMAZING. Some of the best soups I've had here are: Moroccan Lentil Chick Pea Soup, Potato Avocado Soup, and Parsnip Sweet Potato Soup...just to name a few.  I die for all the different salads they have here as well.  They have the same menu for salads everyday - bowtie, couscous, beets, crab, pesto fusili, greek, chickpeas, spinach and garden.  I can't choose a favourite, because they're all tasty!  You've got to try them all.   If you're not aware of this place, it's hands-down the best place for the Home Made Comfort Food that you must try.  Unfortunately with all the condo construction going on in this area, the entire block has been bought by a Condo Company and Hannah's will be closing its doors by 2014...  So, do try and get a piece of their yummy food before it's too late!  Tip: if you're like me and want to taste a bit of everything, go for the 1/2 portions!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh and delicious food! Great outdoor patio. A perfect place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Hannah's Kitchen is a homey nook in Midtown. My company has catered with them a few times and their lasagna and quiche are delicious. The line up is pretty long during lunchtime but it goes by pretty quickly. There is also an outdoor patio overlooking Yonge street. I would recommend one of the gourmet wraps."}
{"text":"Hannah's Kitchen is a comfy, reasonably priced home-style place in mid-town.   1) Food is fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. They always have a large selection to choose from.   2) Their new location is very large, making it a great place to sit down and eat. Bonus: They have a patio!   3) The service....simply awesome! Friendly, attentive and genuinely seem interested in explaining menu items and ensuring customer satisfaction.  This place is a simple, no frills, classic type of spot.   Perfect for those that love a fresh sandwich / soup / salad!"}
{"text":"It was my first day in Toronto, and a friend recommended that I try out Hannah's for a quick lunch.  It was a very cute little place with very friendly service.  I chose the quiche of the day, which came with a small salad and a few pieces of buttered bread.  The quiche wasn't quite as hot as I would have liked, but the flavors were good and the serving was generous.  The salad menu looks amazing, and you can create a combination of several types of salad for about $9, so I will give that a try next time."}
{"text":"I come here because it's close to my work.  The food is A-OK but the prices seems to have gotten more on the pricier side.  I bought a Turkey Club Sandwich and a Snapple that came out to $13.00?  This did not come with a soup or salad but they did offer carrots and celery.  I just can't justify paying $10.00 for a turkey club sandwich with the slices of turkey, 3-4 sliced of microwaved bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and cheddar cheese. ONLY reason I go here is again is because it's the closest thing to my work when I need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I work across the street, so I eat here at least two times a week, usually more. It's a great and healthy place for lunch!  Expect to find: sandwich bar with the usual selections (tuna, egg, turkey etc), two homemade soups that change daily, two different hot meals that change daily (salmon is always great) and a salad bar with the same reliable options: Greek salad (lettuce-free and so good!), chicken fusili pasta salad, crab salad, spinach salad, couscous, beet salad, nicoise, etc etc. Mix and match. Also, her baked goods--cookies, butter tarts, etc--are exceptional but some are a bit on the pricey side. Personally, I love the \"magic\" cookies :)  Tip: if you're planning to eat there on a particular day, check the website to see what that day's soups and hot-meal selections will be. They update the website monthly."}
{"text":"I've walked by Hannah's Kitchen many, many times, so it wasn't surprising that I found myself seated for a quick meal one hot Saturday afternoon.  I decided to order their roast-beef wrap, which I would certainly describe more acutely if the frustratingly-vague website contained a menu.  It arrived a short time later and certainly looked tasty. My first surprise was that the wrap, which had clearly been placed in some kind of a press, was still cold on the inside. The next surprise was the meat itself, which was just okay but not too far removed from something you'd buy in the deli section of your supermarket. The remainder of the toppings were unevenly placed throughout, so I found myself getting some bites with just meat and others with just lettuce and onions. I should also note that the person preparing the wrap employed a very heavy hand with the horseradish.  The meal was described as coming with a mango salad of some kind, so I was disappointed to note that what actually arrived was a generic, garden-variety fruit salad. (Which didn't contain a single mango!)  If the whole thing had cost $5, I probably would've been cool with it, but since it ran me well over $10, I can't really foresee a situation in which I would return."}
{"text":"I've walked by Hannah's on my lunch break a million times, but today was the first time I stopped in.  There were a few people ordering but it wasn't overly busy, and I was served quickly.  Hannah's has a daily rotation of pre-made hot food specials.  They post the week's rotation of specials on a sign on the front door, so you can check what they have without going in, which is nice.  It looks like they also have a set menu of wraps and sandwiches.  I ordered from the daily specials - \"Thai Spring Rolls and Mango Salad.\"  For $9 (tax included) I got three spring rolls and a small side salad.  The spring rolls were tasty but a little greasy, and not crispy.  The salad was good - mixed greens with mango, but had too much salad dressing on it.  I don't want to judge this place based on just one try, but I have to say that I left underwhelmed, both with the quality of the food and the serving size (I was starving by 3:30).  Perhaps I will try it again sometime, but I'm in no hurry to get back there."}
{"text":"Fantastic decor. Nice quiet atmosphere and their salads are delicious. I definitely recommend. Not too expensive but it ain't too cheap either. Great place to clear your mind on a Friday evening. The friendly staff and service will definitely make me come back. Oh yeah and the coffee is dope!"}
