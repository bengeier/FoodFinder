{"text":"Great place on Larchmere! The owners are usually there and are the nicest folks. Great place to eat outside when it's nice, or inside if there's a game on. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious and Old School, we went there on a Thursday night when there just happens to be live jazz! The Academy Burger was delicious, and rumor has it this place hasn't changed in ages.

Our waitress had a hairstyle that I've never seen in person before - only in 1960s movies. The overall aura of the place is ancient and dive-y... they have after-dinner drinks like Brandy Alexanders and beers served in frosty mugs.

I really enjoyed my food but let me warn you: if you come here seeking gourmet, you've missed the point. Pictures of their dark and vintage-y interior, plus the interior of the delicious Academy burger - are on my blog. (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/academy-tavern-larchmere.html)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection! The soups are incredible! The new menu is outstanding and the food is fresh and expertly crafted. Will return again and again!"}
{"text":"The Academy may be the coziest place east of the Mississippi (besides your grandma's house, of course).

They also have veggie burgers; their food is homemade and served in big portions; the people who work there are very warm and friendly; and they have a nice, unpretentious crowd of all ages."}
{"text":"They recently updated there menu which is a huge improvement from before. The beers too. Worth checking out for a casual bite to eat or drink."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! I'll keep coming there anyway. I  have only a few gripes.

1) clean your front door from finger prints and smudge hourly!

2) serve your turkey Ruben with turkey sliced thin. Do not cut off a hunk from the turkey  loaf. This really grouses me out!

3) trust your bartenders to serve a right pour. Using a shot glass to measure looks rookie and tedious. You can have them practice with water and have a competition off hours. It would be fun.

4) Take down that poster at the bar and clean and polish the wood. Customers sit at the bar and can see your shelves and nooks and crannies.

The beer selection is awesome! The food has improved a ton. Keep it up. The atmosphere with great music is terrific. Are you still  having talent there? Your staff is very friendly. I love the service!

Thanks for reading

Mr. Largo"}
{"text":"Great bar to visit. I go here when I don't want any fuss, they have an improving craft beer selection. Wings are the bedt"}
{"text":"This is definitely the type of place your dad or grandpa would like. Bascially an old school bar with solid old tymer bar food.   The burgers are pretty decent - certainly not the best ever however - but do the trick you're jonesing for one.

Academy has a really great lit patio with a nice waterfall installation.  At times live music is played - at a reasonable volume so you can still enjoy your food and conversation AND the music.  

I must warn you however... the waitresses come to the tables quick and they expect that you will be ready to supply them with a drink selection.  There really is no beer list so you really need to be on your toes.  It might be a good idea to decide your beverage of choice while your driving there.  Cause once you sit down the pressure is on.  And heaven forbid you order something you didnt really want."}
{"text":"The Academy has always had a great atmosphere, the perfect old school neighborhood bar. I had not eaten there in awhile, but in the past month I have dined there twice and the food each time has been amazing - so good that you keep thinking about what you had (AM flatbread, falafel burger) and wanting to go back again. Plus last night they had someone playing the piano throughout the evening. We had guests from out of town and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, old school bar with typical bar food menu - but they do have veggie burgers so I can eat while I drink myself to death."}
{"text":"New chef with new menu. Food was great. Big burgers with fresh cut fries.  The open faced sandwich was on thick-cut toasted bread and piled high with mashed potatoes and beef. Service was fast and friendly. The new decor gives the place a modern look.  Will go back, too many things on the menu we want to try."}
{"text":"This place is a dump, not a dive. A neighborhood dive would be great, this place should be closed down. DIrty, rotten wood floors, walls dirty Overall filthy. Service horrible. The owner was apologetic, said the girl in our section was getting over an illness, she forgets things, we should have sat on the other side. Well, when we asked a server from the \"other side\" about  getting some Italian dressing she said\"is that like vinegar?\". And she proceeded to bring us different types of vinegar. Food was average to below average when it finally arrived cold. In addition the server was coughing into her hands, I hate to see what goes on in the kitchen.
I can only think that the good reviews are from years ago. There  is nothing charming about this bar restaurant. This place is well beyond it's prime."}
{"text":"We love this right-out-of-a-50's-TV-show place on a corner in blue collar Cleveland.  Solid from top to bottom.  Tin ceiling, original bar, brews written on the bar glass, tall drinks, specials on an old chalkboard - and how special they are!   You can't go wrong with their burgers, and the fish fry - WOW.  I am not a fish fry fan at all, but this perch was light, delicate, and perfectly prepared.  Coupled with an excellent slaw, a wide assortment of sides, and a huge hunk of fresh bread and butter - sigh."}
{"text":"Met my wife here for dinner food was excellent service was great   Atmosphere is old school but very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They just updated their menu and it's fantastic.  Service has always been friendly and still is now.  I understand they hired new chefs, and I must say their product is quality.  Everything is fresh and made from scratch.  We like the new falafel burgers - really good.  Also, there are now many more vegetarian options which is nice.  They need to update their menu online, 'cause it still reflects the old one."}
{"text":"you can hear del shannon in your head as soon as you walk in.  The owner looks like a 75 year old tony soprano sucking on a cigar.  all the servers say \"sweetheart\" and there was a drunk guy with a jimmy stewart style hairdo that went up to this guy at the bar, grabbed his shoulders and said \"BERNIE, I'M BEGGIN YOU YOU GOTTA BUY MY HOUSE\" and then his wife back at their table starts rasping about how he doesn't even own the house, etc.  so, you see, it doesn't just look like 1955 in there, it very well may BE 1955 in there.  except the indians games are on the tv, and i'm pretty sure they didn't have shin soo choo back then.  anyways the academy burger is bigger than my pet guinea pig and twice as tasty"}
{"text":"Been coming here most of my life.  It's always good and the service is fast and casual. Sam is a cool guy and doesn't price gauge- which I like- anyway give it a shot"}
{"text":"The Academy Tavern has long been a staple of the Larchmere neighborhood. They have recently overhauled their menu and updated the decor. The place was always good. Now it is fantastic! Although the new menu has banished some of the old Academy standbys, you will find them replaced with an amazing selection. Everything from the side salad to the Academy Burger has seen major improvements. The ingredients are extremely fresh and the new chef is top  notch. You can usually expect to see the owner, Sam, somewhere in the joint chatting up the regulars. Make sure you say hi and tell him what you think of the place. I highly recommend a visit. Stop in for a beer and a sandwich or a full on meal. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place blew me out of the water with their food! I have been wanting to try this place out because no one I know has been and WOW I love their food! I came here with my monthly pierogi group and it was well worth the drive from the westside the eastside.

The bartender was awesome (unfortunately, I forget his name) and put up with our shenanigans of not being able to decide what to order. We shared an order of pierogi's and a full size Corned Beef Egg Roll. Don't be fooled, this is not your average egg roll! It is ginormous ans is so jam packed with corned beef. Out of all the pierogi's we have tried, I have to say these are in the top as the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What a great little vibe this spot has...a total neighborhood bar atmosphere where the owners clearly knew lots of folks in the place as they \"worked the room\".

My wife and I decided to share a few dishes (as we most always do).  Our server suggested we order their signature burger and one of the flatbreads.

We started off the meal by splitting the house salad with herb vinaigrette dressing (they were out of the green goddess...d'oh!).  The dressing was tangy / zingy with a nice selection of greens and a few veggies.  Salad came with a nice piece of fresh bread and  butter on the side.

The two main dishes came out together.  The Little Spice flatbread was built around chorizo and a few different grilled veggies (like onions and red peppers).  Unfortunately, it was too doughy and lacked any depth of flavor; I could taste the onions, peppers and chorizo but it needed their Academy Sauce to give it some bite.  The Academy Burger was a little overdone and was decent but nothing \"Wow\".  It was served with two kinds of cheese and strips of bacon.  I also used their Academy Sauce on the burger, which is like a creamy and spicy thousand island dressing.  Fries were well seasoned and would have been good, if they were hot.

I think I may have to give this place another try sometime as so many others have really loved it...I would call it more like just above average."}
{"text":"We went because of the great reviews that were on here. It does have an old timey feel and the staff was really friendly. The food on the other hand was just ok, and not worth the money we paid for it.

 I got the academy burger, ordered it medium, and the burger came out well done and dry as can be with no real taste at all. I was very disappointed after reading how delicious it was.

The people with me got the spaghetti and the veggie burger, the spaghetti was better than the sandwiches, but not enough to warrant us going back there for food. 

We might go back for drinks some time, but honestly you probably wont see us there again."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times over the past ten years but not recently until a few weeks ago. Since then we've come two or three times and sat on the outdoor patio. The food is consistently very good. Today we both had the Academy Burger which is made with Certified Angus Beef (CAB) and is one of the best burgers I've ever had. I ordered the beer-battered onion rings instead of the french fries and they were excellent. As an ending I had the carrot cake which is made by a bakery the Academy has been using for 30 years and it was very good. Great place for home-style cooking and a especially if you have a hankering for a burger."}
{"text":"I have no problem with old, dive-y bars, but this was absolutely the worst service I've ever had combined with  food that was completely blah.  Why go back?  There are so many GOOD places to hear live music.

We ordered, our drinks were brought (including the chintziest wine pour I've ever seen), food arrived, and then we didn't see our server for an hour.  Literally.  We usually have another round, but she showed up with the check in hand.  We sat for another half hour and finally took up the check to the bar ourselves.  Thank goodness I was out with friends, because if that had been a bad date, it would have been hellish."}
{"text":"My favorite go to neighborhood bar! ive been coming here for years and its only gotten better. The owner Sam is a real gentleman that maintains the hometown vibe. The food is straightforward and well prepared comfort food. The meatloaf is my go to favorite! This place is great for Cavs games and on Weds they have live music. The prices and portions are super cheap. If youre in the larchmere neighborhood i highly recommend you come say hello!"}
{"text":"This is a very non-pretentious cozy place. It's tucked into a little corner in the larchmere district and is usually full of locals. At first glance, it doesn't seem particularly special, clearly in need of modernization but the food and service makes up for it. The Academy Burger is famous amongst Clevelanders with a thick juicy patty, bacon, and two cheeses that comes with fries and a tasty dipping sauce that is mayo based. In agreement reviewers, non-smoking section or not, you will end up smelling like smoke so carry out might be a good idea too."}
{"text":"First of all, this is one of the few places open for Sunday lunch on the east side, so yay for them! Second of all, their beer selection is incredible. Overall, this place wins in the category of divey, local, hidden gem. Also, their menu is waaaaay more vegetarian-friendly than I expected it to be! I got the falafel sandwich, which is gigantic falafel patty the size of a large hamburger on a toasted bun with good--yes, good!--veggies and To Die For Fries. Seriously, the fries are worth a trip to Larchmere in and of themselves: crispy, seasoned, and perfectly proportioned. Yummmm. With the falafel, you don't need the bun as the falafel patty itself is so thick, but you can make that decision when your food comes. My husband got some apps: perogies and quesadillas, and they were nice too, if basic. We will be back to try the veggie French dip, cavatelli, for Friday fish fry, and to taste the peanut butter brownie sundae they offer for desert. Oh hot damn."}
{"text":"The new menu and food are great! I live close and haven't been here much because I thought the food was greasy and the menu outdated. The service has always been good and our waitress this time was excellent. We got the turkey reuben, buffalo wings, and side salad. The turkey was thick sliced from a turkey breast, not processed and the sandwich was excellent. Had hand-cut fries (double fried) that were perfect and crispy. 

I'm from Buffalo and a kind of a wing snob and I was surprised that their wings were some of the best I've had in Cleveland (along with Brother's Lounge). I say they hold up to really good wings from Buffalo. 

Side salad was fresh greens and a nice vinegarette. They have also added a really nice beer list!

We will be coming back often from now on!"}
{"text":"I will absolutely be coming back to try more of their delicious food.  My friends and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon to sit at the bar to get some beer and pierogies.  Good beer and delicious pierogies!  They also had a special item menu so we decided to try the Reuben egg rolls.  I am so glad the awesomely friendly bar tender let us know that the \"egg rolls\"  were more the size of burritos.  OMG, are these rolls fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"Good prices.  Don't forget to look at the specials on the board, as they are sometimes your best deals.  
The burger is great; it tastes like it has been hand-pattied and that some thought has gone into the flavor.  The signature 'Academy Burger' is mighty tasty, has two cheeses, and comes with fries.
Although no one sitting next to you in the non-smoking area will actually be smoking, it will smell like they are."}

{"text":"One of my favorite eateries when I come back to Cleveland to visit. It's like stepping into a time capsule loaded with good food, good drinks, great service, with old school prices. Not a bad item on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was A-OK but nothing to brag about to friends. It was definitely a chill bar vibe with bar style food and there was plenty of seating for our group of 6 around 5pm. The menu has a decent variety and prices aren't horrible but some things seem more expensive than the vibe of the place. Gives you the idea of a regulars place as people knew each other by name and servers sat down with visitors. Our food took a very long time to come out and we were rushing to scarf it down to make it to our event in time. I got the Academy Burger and it was pretty tasty but the tots were the best part. 

Beer was cold and a good variety but no specials for craft beers during HH so typical price. We had fun with one another but I wouldnt go back again for the food or drinks unless all my friends chose to meet there and I wanted to stop in to see them or something like that."}
{"text":"Previously 4-stars, now 5.  The essence of my previous review still holds:  \"Good comfort food, fast service, no attitude, real people. A great Cleveland dive.\"

This is an old-school Cleveland bar/restaurant run by a guy (I think his name is Sam) who hasn't changed the place in a million years. And the reason it never changes is that it does what it does perfectly--great burgers, great fish fries, great comfort food, not much money. This is a good place to become a regular. All are welcome, and what you see at Academy is a slice of Cleveland locals from white-collar upper-middle-income to blue-collar lower middle class, all here for the simple good food and the friendly service.

When people keep coming back to the same places for decades, there's a reason."}
{"text":"I was there a couple months ago and a couple weeks ago. Between the 2 visits they got reprinted menus a new cook (so they said) and updated their beer list from 1986 to 2015 (so excited, that was one the thing I didn't like about the place. 
I can't really say anything about the food. I always get the Academy burger and it's always incredibly delicious, so I'll keep getting it. I hear their patio area is really nice but I never sit there I love all the old wood of the interior seating. This place gets real busy for friday/saturday dinner so come early, the locals and other regulars have known about this place for decades and they show up in force (and with good reason!)."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks ago. The food was exactly what you expect from a tavern- nothing particularly special, just greasy bar food- but sometimes greasy bar food is just what you want! Our waitress was wonderful- had lots of advice about the extensive beer list, and when she realized they were out of many of the beers we wanted to order, she offered us one on the house. We loved our experience there."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant with a relaxing patio out back. Sandwiches are priced below 10 bucks. Dinners are a little more. There is something for everyone. Beer selection is good. Great little neighborhood bar......"}
{"text":"In my life the Academy Tavern has always been. The kids on my block walked by Academy Tavern on our way to the Saturday matinee at the Colony. Then Cleveland was one of the largest cities in the nation. Gays and hippies had not liberalized San Francisco and Florida was orange groves and winter vacations. As undergraduates we met here during breaks from our widely dispersed colleges. We ate hamburgers here before we saw the Supremes at Louie's  while military tanks drove along the burning Hough Avenue.

For the boomers Academy Tavern was a pause between life's events. That it still survives looking much the same and serving much the same food is comforting. Reviewers stated this old school place is where you take your old grandfather and I must agree. It is nice to sit back and remember all the times we were here and all that we accomplished. Perhaps Melt or some other place will be your Academy Tavern."}
{"text":"This is truly a classic in Cleveland.  Amazing burger, great home made italian salad dressing and charmingly eccentric staff.  I practically grew up here and it feels like home.  The have recently spruced up the joint including a patio."}
{"text":"So I can cross coming here off my bucket list!  It has been around for a long time.  You seat yourself, so you may need to come early.  Family, dive bar ambiance.  You can seen customers from college students to octogenarians at the same time.  All seem to enjoy being here.  We had the fish fry - order one for two people.  The clam chowder was loaded with clams and obviously freshly made.  The pierogies were very good.  Nice selection from the bar.  Service was friendly.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Casual pub on Larchmere.  The eggplant parmesan is fantastic. The turkey burger and fries were both delicious.  This a great place for comfort food.  Entrees run about 10$.  Its more affordable but less fancy food then the tavern across the street.  Both great venues but this one is just more casual.  It's open Sunday nights unlike most places on Larchmere!"}
{"text":"The pike did not disappoint!  Huge portion and so flakey and delicious!  Our waitress was attentive; fun to have her wait our table. We loved the pub feel the minute we walked in. Worth our 40 minute drive."}
{"text":"This would be my go-to place to watch sports if I lived in the Shaker heights area.  Partook of an eggplant parmesan sandwich and a Christmas ale (still on tap, yay!) during a recent trip and the food was pretty good bar fare.  Not sure if I would come back for the sandwich alone, but the bar definitely serves its purpose as a neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"The Academy Tavern is everything an \"Ol' Timers Bar\" should be and more....

This old building is located on the corner of Larchmere and East 128th and has been around since 1939 as the sign out front notes. The menu looks ancient but comforting and the beer is served with a small juice glass. My Dad tells me this is the way they used to serve beer. Pour a few sips in the glass and drink up. After giving this method a whirl, the idea grew on me and I drank my beer sip by sip in that teeny tiny juice glass throughout the entire night. It felt nostalgic! 

Anyways, I discovered this place last Saturday night when I had a craving for a Burger. It began with a search on local food blogs and of course this wonderful darn site. The consensus pointed me to the Academy Tavern for a tasty burger in a relaxed atmosphere. 

Normally with an establishment like this, it's full of regulars and a newcomer like myself might get looked at weird for crossing \"onto their turf\". Not at this place. The wife and I were instantly welcomed into the place and got to sit outside on the recently revamped patio. 

The service was fast and friendly. The patio atmosphere was nicely surrounded with a wooden fence and landscaping with a tiny waterfall in the corner.  

By the time we ordered dinner, the sun started to go down, so I didn't exactly get a good look at what I was eating, but I do know the burger quenched my craving. It was substantial in size and pretty satisfying. 

Decent overall experience, good prices and commendable service. They didn't have an extensive beer selection, but then again, this isn't a place you come to order pints of micro-brews. And besides, anything besides generic domestic brands just woudn't look as cool when sipping out of those tiny juice glasses."}
{"text":"Had obscenities yelled at me from an over served patron sitting next to me, because I rode my bicycle to have dinner here and he hates cyclists.  Did not receive an apology and the patron continued to be served and scream vulgarities at myself and other cyclists in the room.  The food was fine, but I have issue with allowing these types of patrons to ruin others experience of others.  Eventually we left and he stayed.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an establishment with great food, great staff and a great draft beer selection, then this is the place for you! We visited Academy Tavern by recommendation of a friend (said they had the best patio in town). Unfortunately it started to rain on our way but that didn't deter us from giving this place a try. The outside looks like a typical dive but don't let that scare you away! The inside is warm and welcoming and has a vintage old time watering hole feel to it. I can't say enough good things about the staff. Friendly and attentive! The food was phenomenal! We ordered a flatbread and falafel burger. We had such an enjoyable experience and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here for the fish fry on a Friday during Lent. It took awhile to find a seat, but I was constantly being assured by leaving customers that the food was worth the wait. We get a seat at the bar and order a couple beers and our dinner (we both had the perch dinners). I usually don't have a problem waiting for food to come out, but it took nearly an hour for us to receive our 2 dinners and an appetizer of pierogis. I cut into my fish and about half way through the first piece I find a pin bone. I shrug it off as a missed bone and continue eating. In the second piece is where it went south. I only ate half the piece of fish and found an additional 4 pin bones. Now I've done some fishing in my life, and I know it can be difficult to get all the pin bones when filleting perch, but this was ridiculous. I immediately lose my desire to continue eating in fear of missing one of the bones and choking. I bring the bones to the bartender's attention and she apologized and took the bones back to the chef. The response I received from the chef was \"that he's glad you found the bones, but it's fish and there's not a whole lot you can do, ya know?\" I was absolutely floored at this response. I bit my tongue asked for the bill, paid, and walked out the door. 

I really wanted to give the Academy Tavern a higher rating. I love the atmosphere and the selection of beer was hard to beat, but their customer service is severely lacking. Maybe I'll give this place a shot again sometime down the road, but for now I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Fish Fridays is a big GO! here.  Perch or pike. Prepared to perfection. Fries and slaw could be better but who cares when the fish is so good. If you haven't been here for a while they have spruced the place up. Check them out."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax and grab a beer.  The patio is nice and bright in the summer, I find it a bit dark inside but it gives a real retro feel."}
{"text":"Great place to have a cold one with the renowned Academy Burger while catching a game or two or the tubes.  Friendly, attentive staff and friendly customers and atmosphere"}
{"text":"We are visiting artists in the Cain Park art fair and dropped by this evening for a bite to eat and a couple of beers.  I am stunned that this placed is not packed with people!  The service is attentive, the food, awesome and the beer selection is good, too.  Beside all this, the whole vibe is amazing!  Completely laid back and friendly.  This place is a gem!  We are coming in again before we leave.  Locals, get with it!  You are missing out;. Head over and enjoy something that's been around since 1939!"}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood staple. The food is consistently good, and they always have a good variety of beers on tap, which changes regularly. I've heard the entrees are good, but I always go there for a burger or the Turkey Reuben (delicious). The atmosphere is nice too, on the dark side with lots of wood, pretty old fashioned looking. I just wish they would replace the high top tables inside with regular tables or booths. The back patio is also incredible in the summer. I've had several nice evenings having dinner out there, often with live music. I really like Academy!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a local Yelp Elite event so I stopped by here for dinner with fellow Yelpers. 

Atmosphere: Casual ambiance. Big space. A bit dark inside. I wish there was more natural light.

Food: I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was okay but there was too much marinara sauce (tomato red sauce). I think the sandwich would have tasted better without the the sauce actually. I ordered in a little bit of a rush so I couldn't really look at the menu but in my head the fact that marinara sauce was in this sandwich didn't quite make sense since you normally find that in Pizza. Anyway, the sweet potato fries were great though. 

Service: Quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"You had me at pulled-pork!

 I stopped by this little historic landmark for a quick lunch today. The decor is vintage and the bar is comparable to any long-lived tavern in the area. The staff was friendly and the menu was fair. I ordered today's special, the pulled pork sandwich and slaw. It was really more shaved pork than pulled, but who am I to judge? The BBQ sauce was tangy and the slaw was homemade. All in all, this was an adequate lunch spot!

I would check it out if I were you... The also have a bangin' patio in the back!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that this is somewhat of a temporary rating because I would like to come back. The patio is absolutely adorable, very quaint and the food was delicious. Our server, however was awful. At the beginning, she was great and came to check on us a couple times. Once we ordered food she disappeared. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt because the Indians game was on but I literally never saw her until we decided to come inside to watch the rest of the game. A few times that the door to the patio opened I saw her inside sitting at the bar WATCHING the game while other servers were bustling around trying to get food out. Another server brought our food and at that point we made our way inside and sat next to the owner Sam, who is nice. Even at this point, now that the game was over, we still had to ask twice to close our tab. It was more frustrating then anything. I wanted to say something while sitting next to the owner but he was in conversation with numerous people. However, the food was great and other servers seem to be making the job their first priority. Maybe I will have an update soon when I make my way back!"}
{"text":"Why bother?

The bread was stale.  I mean, not just a wee bit toothy stale, but a knock it on the table and you have a rhythm section stale.  The food was bad, the portions were miserly, and the service was beyond slow.  I guess I shouldn't care that the portions were miserly.  I really wouldn't want to eat any more of what they served.   Still, the prices were not cheap enough to merit the parsimony.

How sad.  I had heard this was a classic dive.  It's a dive all right.  It would be completely fabulous if there was anything to recommend it beyond the cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy the Academy Tavern and I'd be happy to tell you why: 

- Vintage Vibes: the gorgeous, Art Deco, wooden bar knocks my socks off! Ever time I walk in the door I'm gobsmacked by it; it's a place out of time. It would appear that nothing has been changed since opening day! 
- Best Casual Burgers in Town: A great, solid, classic burger. Beat's the B-Spot, easily. They serve a limited menu and everything is simple, homemade, and straight-forward. Delicious. 
- Absence of Attitude: The Academy is just a great, old school bar with no pretense and a great draft beer selection. The beautiful patio is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Good good bar. Friendly people and fabulous food. I've been here for lunch twice this week and will come back again if I have time. Highly recommended. Great draft selection also."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I try to stop in once a week.  The servers take great care of us.  The beer selection is good, and the food is fantastic!
I try to order off the Specials as much as I can.  However the regular menu is awesome as well.  I will continue to visit so long as they keep everything up!"}
