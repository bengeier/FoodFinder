{"text":"This is inside the St. Lawrence Market on the second floor.  Had pizza and their freshly-made ravioli and both were hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious.  The proprietor and who I assume is his son were both really friendly and provided great service.  Recommend without hesitation!"}
{"text":"3.stars - Good for a quick lunch / dinner or for picking up home made pasta & sauces.    The name is odd... on all my visits, I never saw a single person order Pizza or ice cream! Everyone gets the pasta as far as I can tell. Located in the back of the market by Buster Sea Cove, line ups move quickly and there is plenty of seating throughout the market to enjoy your pasta.  All the pastas are homemade - cheese or meat ravioli, tri-coloured spaghetti and various other pasta shapes. Definitely better than typical downtown food court options.   Sauces are rather good as well for quick takeout - I personally love the simple tomato sauce. You can also select a meat sauce, white Alfredo sauce or a pesto option. Spicy versions also available. There is a \"cult\" following for their combo sauce - tomato, pesto and Alfredo mixed together - you can get it on your pasta or in a container to bring home.  They charge around $10 for a large bowl of pasta and sauce. Given the fresh ingredients, I think its well worth it.   They sell all their pastas and sauces separately so you can prepare later at home. Bags of their pasta can be up to $10-$12 but that appears to be the price to pay for fresh made pasta and sauces.   Check it out next time your in the market. Not exactly high end Italian dinning but above average...  BK"}
{"text":"Pasta with the combo sauce. That's my fave.    They're always giving samples of their freshly made pasta along with a tomato meat sauce or their combo (pesto, tomato, and alfredo).  It's really tasty.    You can purchase pasta and sauce separately so you can cook it at home.  Otherwise, get a container and eat it outside on a picnic bench for lunch!    I've never had pizza or ice cream here before.  They should really change their name."}
{"text":"This pizza/pasta restaurant tucked away in the corner inside St. Lawrence market was a great new find. They have samples served beside their restaurant so you can try out their pasta before ordering. I got the small ravioli half and half, which you get both cheese and meat ravioli, and then got their \"combo sauce\" on top. 10/10 recommend their combo sauce. It's tomato, alfredo, and pesto all together, and I asked for some meat sauce as well. It was $13 all together. The small size was very filling. They also have a small market on the side where you can buy their pasta or sauces, so you can take it home and make some on your own!"}
{"text":"This take-away counter is located in the south-west corner of the St. Lawrence Market (the one with all the shops and stores not the farmers market). It offers homemade pastas from whole wheat, coloured pasta like squid ink and homemade sauces. One of their special sauces is the \"tricolour\" sauce which is a mixture of tomato, alfredo and pesto sauces-gotta taste it to believe it!   They also sell hot pasta and pizza to eat in/to go and they are good portions-a large pasta could easly feed two. I\"m fan of the fusilli with meat sauce-something about the meat sauce here is really comforting and savory. Yum! This is a nice place to hit up for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good pasta! The guy at the front gave my friend and I a sample before deciding on getting a full bowl. A lot of pasta so I'd say worth the price! If you're not allergic get the combo sauce (a mix of pesto, alfredo, and tomato!) as it's really tasty!"}
{"text":"Will always love this place for their free  pasta snd sauce sampling and for years,  we  would always buy a bag of fresh pasta and the signature sauce. But my last bill was $21 for a half bag of fresh ravioli and a half container of the sauce. They've really jacked up their prices too much lately. Having second  thoughts buying next time...."}
{"text":"The best ravioli is the cooked meat ravioli with meat sauce and cheese at the St. Lawrence market .  This shop is called \"St.Lawrence Pizza & Ice Cream\" but almost everyone there gets their fresh homemade pastas, or their takeout cooked pastas.   I don't actually love their fresh ravioli you can purchase to cook at home...but somehow their cooked raviolis for takeout .... is different and soooo GOOD.    We are regulars there and we tend to buy a large cooked meat ravioli with extra meat sauce and extra cheese.  Make sure to ask for extra and if you don't get enough...ask again.  It's not truly full if they don't have trouble putting on the lid.    Usually a large box is more then enough for lunch for both of us.  We tend to alternate Saturday lunches between ravioli and peameal bacon sandwiches at Carousel Bakery. ."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with my slice of pizza here. It tasted exactly like Domino's to me -- and I'm not a fan of Domino's. When you order a slice, they choose a big piece, warm it up, and then slice it in half so you can pick it up. That part is nice.  I ended up not finishing mine. I ate the cheese off the top and threw the dough away. It had too much seasoning and not enough flavor. I'm hopeful that there are other better places in the St. Lawrence Market for lunch."}
{"text":"This was the best pasta sauce I've ever tasted!!!  I loved it and I wish I could make it here in the US or at least get it somewhere nearby.  The combo sauce was tomato sauce, alfredo sauce and pesto mixed together and you can get it regular or spicy and man oh man is it good.  I'm serious when I say the best sauce ever.  They have samples that say they were sampling the cheese ravioli and the spicy combination sauce.  It taste so fresh, I bought the sauce and some fresh pasta to take home, my friends did as well.  I also ordered ravioli with spicy combination sauce to eat while I was there.  This sauce is life changing!!!  I'll probably never have sauce this good again..."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. We saw this place and saw that they made pasta on the premises. Daughter ordered the fusili with spicy tomato sauce. She loved it. We were so surprised that this stand serve fresh pasta! Service is friendly."}
{"text":"On our way to Mustachio, I noticed there as a pretty big take away counter just off the stairs to the basement level of the south building.  I made a mental note of it as I saw these giant pizzas being taken out of their oven and the smell made me want to grab a few slices.  A few days later, I popped back into SLM and headed over to this great little place.  St. Larence Pizza & Ice Cream sells more than just those two but they also sell fresh pasta to go and also for you to cook at home.  With everything from spinach, tomato, and filled raviolis, it was pretty amazing to look at.  Though I wouldn't say this place is a 4 star for food quality... it's definitely above average.  So maybe a 3.5 star place?  This particular lunch trip, I zero'd in on the pizza.  Seeing how I got there at quarter to noon, most of the pizzas were super fresh still and only a small line was here.  The guy working the counter was friendly and smiling as he asked me what I wanted.  I asked him if he had any veggie options and he told me that a fresh mushroom and pesto pizza just came out.  Score!  The slice I got was pretty big.  It was just as big as Pizza Pizza slices and just as affordable.  The difference is quality.  You can see the guy working the dough, pouring sauces, and placing fresh toppings (not canned!) onto the pizza before sliding them into oven.  Considering it's only $3 for such a big flavourful piece, I think it's a steal and possibly the best pizza fast food option in the Financial District area.  The pesto was bright and bold but not too oily.  The mushrooms were nicely charred at the corners so it added another depth to the earthy taste.  I like my pizza light sauced and this place fit the bill.  It had a bit of a tang from the tomato's acidity but balanced with some good seasoning.  The weakest link of the pizza was the crust sadly.  It's not lovingly charred like Pizza e Pazzi or Pizza Libretto but this place doesn't use a wood fire or coal oven either.  It was soft in the middle to the point you couldn't hold it to eat it that way.  You needed a fork and knife.  It didn't have a strong flavour either.  But for $3 and a huge piece with great toppings... you can't beat it.  I love supporting local and unique eateries and this place is a definite go for me when I'm told to work in the Financial District.  I haven't tried their pastas but considering how great my first experience was, I'm willing to try it the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Best pasta in the core.  Make sure you ask for cheese under the sauce so it's gooey and melted and sprinkle the garlic powder on top.  Pasta made fresh on site."}
