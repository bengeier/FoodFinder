{"text":"We've been looking for a great BBQ restaurant and glad we tried FBI! Came in late on a Sunday not knowing they closed at 6, they couldn't have been more accommodating and did not rush us. Food was excellent and staff terrific! Cute and interior, we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Good place and a great selection of quality spirits.. U had the green chili chicken sandwich which is the chefs special.. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"This BBQ is awesome! The best sliced beef brisket I have ever had. Great service and ambiance. Try the corn fritters."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere around!! Great food with vegan options as well! Perfect for everything from office lunch breaks to date night. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I try to only write reviews of places I like, but I feel like I owe the bbq eating public to warn them of this place.  It is really bad. I had the brisket.  What real bbq place serves the meat already sauced (with a cloyingly sweet one at that)?  My wife got the \"Chef's special\":  chicken verde.  I cannot put into words how bad this was.  It was mushy chicken in a really poorly conceived green sauce with, what appeared to be, either cheese whiz or velveeta.  They got 2 stars because the server and host were warm and attentive, and the space was bright and clean.  But the food?  Not good."}
{"text":"What a great find! We were looking for a late night bite and Yelp sent us here...glad we did. Great brisket with just the right amount of fat and some of the best corn fritters ever! Their beer and bourbon selection is great too. If you loved their food truck, then ya gotta try their brick and mortar!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing food and service! Came in during a soft opening and everything was perfect! I got the fire balls, chicken pulled pork sliders and the blackberry cobbler. The cobbler takes 45 minutes to make but it comes out fresh and hot! The decor inside is beautiful. It's warm and friendly. It's cozy and the owners are such wonderful people. One of the best kept secrets is the vault! You must ask about it!"}
{"text":"Amazing finally good no scratch that GREAT barbecue in Scottsdale. Not a bad thing on the menu. They some interesting twists on the old barbecue standards.

Secondly they take amazing care of you.  Did I actually use amazing twice, I guess I did and it is deserved. You definitely feel like family here. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but I can't think of a better way to say it. I guess you will just have to see for yourself."}
{"text":"It's about time we got some great barbecue in Scottsdale! The breakfast burritos are probably some of the best in the area. I like that you can also buy a bottle there and keep it in their cellar for when you need to entertain guests. Get one of those ASAP before the spaces are all gone. The owners were nice, and made me feel like I was eating in their backyard with them. I stumbled in there accidentally thinking they were open for breakfast and got a  burrito. When I asked about their hours they let me know that they aren't open for breakfast on weekdays. That blew me away as they took care of me as if they were and didn't make mention of it."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and customer service! Vegan options as well. Best barbeque and corn fritters!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I read online that BBQ Innovations was new restaurant in Scottsdale near my house.  I am not a big BBQ fan but I stopped  by to pick up take out.  I was greeted by a friendly host and told that their sliced brisket was the best.  My husband loves ribs so I ordered him a half rack of ribs with coleslaw (huge potion).  I am not a big meat eater, but the way the host described the brisket made my mouth water.  I ordered the sliced brisket sandwich(huge), with a side of potato salad.  Driving home, the smell of the food had me salivating.  Let me say, the brisket sandwich was wonderful!!!  Mind you I don't eat meat very often.  My husband enjoyed his ribs and thoroughly enjoyed the half of brisket sandwich I saved for him.  We will certainly be repeat customers and will share this little gem with all."}
{"text":"I work at John Jay Automotive down the street, they came in to our shop and dropped off menus informing us about their $2 delivery fee!! Which is very cheap for the Scottsdale area. When you first enter you can feel the comfortability of the establishment. The staff is very sweet and nice. The chef was intelligible and makes some amazing vegan wing sauce. It's hard to find vegan food so the fact a BBQ place has vegan options makes me so happy!!! I really enjoyed my meal. Only downside is the price but it was 100% worth it. I also LOVE the outdoor patio where you can bring your dog. I can't wait to have time to sit and eat there instead of getting take out."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, but this place is overpriced for the serving size and quality of food."}
{"text":"I am so happy I came here for Mother's Day!  It was recommended by friends and had a wonderful baby back rib meal!  The coleslaw was fresh and tasty and can't wait to return.  My son had the pulled barbecued pork sandwich and ate every morsel.   Prices were extremely reasonable and the atmosphere and staff/owners were top notch!  Wonderful find!"}
{"text":"Read other reviews, again, and think we may have been at different locations. Ordered the Texas brisket with cole slaw and iced tea. The brisket was over the top fatty, that would be warmed fat maintaining its raw look without any char to it. Beyond that critical issue was the near flavorless taste of a rich wood aroma required from BBQ meats. It didn't quite have the texture of long and slow smoked meat, but the in-the-oven draped with some minimal BBQ sauce. The bun was a bit firm as day old bread would be expected to taste like and have firmness. The cole slaw has the makings of wholesale purchases flavor and texture. I really enjoy cole slaw a lot;however, this lacked what I would expect from a BBQ restaurant. The service at best was poor. Had to ask for refill on tea, extra napkins and wasn't given hand wipes as given in all BBQ restaurants. Oh, we were there 2 hours before closing and we were the only ones there, on a Saturday. Lastly, the tea was stale. Period. 
Overall not at all what would be required for a \"Premium\" BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Texas style brisket sandwich !! boom !! loved it.. it has fat so if you dont like the fat dont order the Texas style order the regular and the corn fritters are great also, they are more like a beignet , i just wish they served more then 3, maybe like 20.. Cant wait to go back to get more texas style and fritters and want to try there other stuff because it also looks great."}
{"text":"Excellent & delish BBQ! Their new place is wonderful, great job, all redone & top drawer.
I was talking to the owner, JC (he & his wife, Mary are lovely folks) & suggested to try the next one ~a Veggie BBQ.
Try this place, you won't be disappointed & will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is wonderful and the service is excellent. Kind of hard to see at night because it's in an industrial area but I assure you it's worth coming. Great selections of wine, and the corn fritters are to die for. Beef brisket sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic Barbecue and great atmosphere, a must try! I Had Texas style Brisket sandwich, melt in your mouth delicious. Date had green chili chicken sandwich, she loved it enough to take her leftovers home!"}
{"text":"FBI is an excellent place to go for BBQ. Best pulled pork sandwich that I have eaten. My husband had the melt in your mouth brisket sandwich which was also excellent. Potato salad side or corn fritters are delicious. Great atmosphere. Ralph, the bartender was very friendly and informative and the chef is available for any questions you may have about the menu. Would highly recommend this restaurant. And prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I loved the Smoked Wings!! The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy! Better than Zipps or Buffalo. The atmosphere is great, the food and the staff are even better. Thank You"}
{"text":"Great looking bar and atmosphere. I had the Sliced BBQ Brisket sandwich with a side of coleslaw. @ $15 bucks it should have been spectacular. It was good but for my taste with only one side for $15 I'd say over priced. I'll be back to try again and they might be able to earn a 4th star but they'd need to hit it out of the ballpark for a 5 star review. Great service, real nice bartender. Love the idea of the liquor locker. You can buy a bottle and stash it for later. Great long happy hour."}
{"text":"I haven't actually gone into the restaurant, but I had the food delivered. The best part of the experience was the friendly staff and delivery driver. We received the order in less than 30 min which was great, but the food was less than sub par. We got the felon fries which were clearly frozen French fries drowned in canned nacho cheese and shredded chicken. The menu says melted cheese, so I guess I was assuming shredded cheese. We also had the road king burger, I'd be willing to bet the patty itself was frozen. They slapped a slice of American cheese and some mediocre shredded pork on top. The Potato salad and BBQ sauce tasted store bought and the ranch most definitely was. I'm just wondering if they make anything at all in house? I'd stop in to check out the whiskey selection, but I definitely wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"What  a great  place. Phenomenal food great atmosphere  incredible service and.great owners.  Do not miss.this place. It's amazing"}
