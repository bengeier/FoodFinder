{"text":"In Markham there are a LOT of offerings for Chinese food, but knowing how to pick out the right one for your current situation is key to satisfying your hunger or craving!  For a quick dine-in lunch, or grab-and-go take out, I would recommend Ace Canton Kitchen if you're in the area. It's not fancy, it's no frills. In typical Chinese food court fashion, the menu items are pasted all over the walls in bright neon colours papers. Of course, to the non-Chinese these menu items may as well not be there, because they're written in Chinese. There's ample dining space so don't worry too much if you're stopping by for lunch. However there is not a whole lot of parking space in their shared plaza, and getting in and out with traffic is terrible.   The food is pretty decent. Not fancy fare, not fine dining, but meets expectations. Although I do find it to be a little on the saltier side, but hey, this is essentially Chinese fast food we're talking about here. You can expect all your typical Cantonese style dishes here, including my personal favourite: pickled vegetables & pork on rice!  Prices are cheap! You get the right amount of bang for your buck.   Service is fast and straight to the point. No complaints there.   It's nothing to go out of your way to taste, but if you're in the area and you could use some quick Chinese chow, this would be a good choice against any other place in the immediate area."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat for a quick lunch or for a take out meal. There are a lot of options to choose from , ranging from fried rice to fried noodles. Expect to spend around $6 for a nice lunch with a drink. If you don't want to cook dinner for an evening, be sure to come to Ace Canton Kitchen with very reasonable dinner sets and dishes for take out orders. I would strongly recommend calling in if you are looking to make a take out order , especially during peak lunch and dinner hours."}
{"text":"This is a food court booth operated out of a store.  The counter looks it, the wall menus look it, the no frills seating feels it, the pricing speaks it, the food tastes it.  The dining process is identical to being at a food court: order at counter, pay (no tip necessary), find a seat to sit down and eat or take the food back home or office.  Straight forward, simple.  I ordered take out from the lunch specials ($7 tax included).  The chicken on rice tasted alright.  The portion was decent.  The food was ready promptly.  As James C said, it meets expectation.  As I didn't dine in, I don't know if there is waiter services.  If there is any, I suspect it would be minimum.  There are other lunch menus, so the selection is good.  There are dinner entrees available.  Parking can be difficult during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Good selection of food with decent pricing. I'd go there more often if only the parking space is not insanely messy and virtually non existent."}
{"text":"Regular here during weekday lunch hours. I recommend calling in to order for pickup during busy hours. Food is ok. Average food price with drinks is $6."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a good meal while staying at the hotel next door but they don't take Credit Cards and there is no ATM. Cash Only warning. But the food looked good."}
