{"text":"Ce St-Hubert a une très bonne ambience familiale. Le décor interieur est très accueillant. Le service est toujours chaleureux et rapide ce qui rend le repas plaisant. Le restaurant n'est pas trops achanlandé d'habitude ce qui garantie de trouver une table sans attendre. Cependant pour les occasions spécials une réservation est conseillé. La nourriture est toujours très appréciée."}
{"text":"The food is great, however the service here is the worst. The waitress we had sat us in an empty restaurant next to a child's birthday party. Then proceeded to talk down to me the whole meal (my French isn't excellent, but my wife's there to save me). She would double question all my orders then bring me the wrong thing anyway. We had to get another waitress to refill my wife's drink. She was constantly rude and never there. When the bill came I of course didn't tip, and here the really fun part. She looks at my wife (who's not paying) and says we forgot the tip... We love St. Hubert but we're never going back to this one. (Speculation) she seems like the type of person who hates serving English people because they won't tip but then treats them like crap. Sorry if it's a bit disjointed, it's fairly fresh and this is my first review."}
{"text":"This may not be the classy French restaurant one would hope to see in Montreal, but boy did it hit the spot. Basically all comfort food: the basic rotisserie chicken, ribs, fries, drinks. The drinks were pretty well made, as a bartender myself I went for another round, though the mojito did have a bit more mint than I would've liked. We had the specialty st. hubert poutine which was really good - the sauce was just a bit heavy and not really my favorite. Of course we ordered the chicken which was prepared beautifully, not one part overcooked. Also tried the ribs which come in either small or large and the small was plenty, and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Outdoor seating is very pleasant, especially in the evening when it's kind of windy, patio is right on St. Catherine st. Cole slaw that was served with the dinner was amazing, honestly some of the best I've had. But if anything it was the service that won me over!  The waitress was uber friendly and polite, and she definitely gave us enough attention though she seemed to be running around a bit. The bar inside looks wonderful and the atmosphere  seems nice, though this would really be a place I'd go to for patio seating and all around good comfort food."}
{"text":"No need to say anything it's 0. 

There is much better places in laval"}
{"text":"Service is a little slow. Food is good but even better is the take out. For just $7 you get a bigger portion then what the restaurant serves.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Being from Toronto I have to say st hurbert isn't the same as Swiss chalet. The Swiss chalet sauce is everything. The service is was good. Server was friendly and quick. Food was not bad either. Big plus free wifi 3 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Wir waren mit einer großen Gruppe da, das hat die Bedienung anscheinend etwas überfordert- das schon mal vorweg. Bis die Bestellung aufgenommen war und die georderten Getränke und Speisen an die richtigen Personen verteilt werden konnten, hat es gedauert. 
Das Essen war durchaus durchschnittlich und die Preise auch, die Bedienung gehetzt aber freundlich. 
Von selbst wäre ich wohl nicht auf die Idee gekommen, da essen zu gehen, aber so ist das bei Demokratie :) Menü besteht größtenteils aus Burgern und Hühnchen & Co. 
Ich meine, den Laden mehrfach gesehen zu haben, wird wohl eine Kette sein."}
{"text":"nicht sehr viel Charme. Das Essen kann ich mit 2 Sternen auszeichnen."}
{"text":"Even though this place seems to be popular for its chicken, I'm a vegetarian and ended up getting the warm spinach salad without the chicken. It was very good! The spinach was atop of grilled vegetables with some sort of creamy dressing that went super well with the spinach. It was kind of pricey, but I guess that would have accounted for the chicken I didn't order. 
I probably would have liked St Hubert a lot better if I was an omnivore, but was all the same still quite pleased with my spinach salad."}
{"text":"Chicken was good but on the drier side. Service not so good. Waitress came only to get our order, drop off the food and being the pre-ordered dessert. Water refill - none. Drink refill none. No smiles with service. That would at least get a better tip."}
{"text":"amateur de poulet ce lieu est pour vous ! notre equivalent de flunch francais, certe un peu mieux !"}

{"text":"(Written in English)

Me and me mates went here for a dinner one night as part of a school trip. I cannot express my dissatisfaction with this place.

Upon arrival, the place seemed nice enough. However, under the table was disgusting. I dropped a glove down there and it came back covered in slushy mess. 

We all got the hot chicken (wasn't much of a choice). While waiting, we got our drinks (mostly soda and water). Service was nice, but almost oblivious after a while (\"Hello? Can we get more soda? At least water? No? Ok.\") Chicken came finally. It was almost raw and had very little flavor. (Grocery store chicken may have been better in hindsight). Fries were decent, but reminded me too much of McDonald's, just with less salt.

For desert, we ordered apple pie. What we got was thickened applesauce with tons of sugar in a (unremarkable). It wasn't even edible.

As if that wasn't enough, my friend got a backpack stolen there.

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Food was average.  Definitely has a Swiss Chalet (another Canadian food chain) similarity in the food.  I had ribs and chicken combo.  The ribs are actually quite good and the chicken came with Swiss Chalet-style gravy.  

The decor is nice and the restaurant is quite large.  There are large TV's in the bar area.  No WIFI.

Unfortuantely, on this night, the service was just awful.  There was a fair number of people there, but not bursting at the seams.  Not enough wait staff to cover that amount of people, however, and it took FOREVER to get any service."}
{"text":"St.Hubert had good food, and convenient hours. The group felt hungry at around 8-9 pm, and ordered a huge meal for 20 people. 

The food came fairly quickly, which was great! The ribs were so good that I felt like I was in heaven. I can't lie, but the fries were pretty bad. I never knew you could screw up fries. The bbq chicken was good too. 

Good place if you don't feel like eating out. I would suggest they work on those fries though.

{"text":"Ah, les rôtisseries St-Hubert...un classique québécois. Toute famille de classe moyenne connaît bien ce resto qui sert depuis des années une formule gagnante: du poulet, des frites et la salade de choux, dans une ambiance très familiale (côté salle à manger) ou plus animée (côté resto-bar).

Sauf que depuis quelques années, St-Hubert ne fait qu'accumuler les déceptions. Le poulet est toujours du poulet, mais la qualité diminue quelque peu. Les portions offertes sont plus petites qu'avant: beaucoup moins de frites, moins de sauce brune, verres moins grands. Oh oui, il est toujours possible de demander une portion de sauce ou de frites supplémentaire, mais qui a envie d'attendre que le serveur réapparaisse pour répondre à notre requête? C'est désagréable. 

Sans compter les prix qui ont augmentés de manière marquée. Si vous vous en tenez au quart de poulet durant le Midi Go, ça va encore, mais dès que vous êtes un peu plus aventurier (côtes levées, faijitas) attention la facture explose! 

Vous tenez à manger du poulet? Des compétiteurs offrent le bar à salade et de plus grandes portions. Mais évitez St-Hubert où le rapport qualité prix est devenu désavantageux. Les portions vous donneront envie d'aller manger ailleurs les prochaines fois, pour être rassasié.

C'est dommage, j'ai longtemps été une fan mais pour nous c'est fini depuis un an au moins, il y a tellement d'autres endroits qui font notre bonheur."}
{"text":"Très mauvais service. Serveur incompétent et insolent en plus. Service lent, repas tiède. Ce n'est pas a la hauteur de ce que je connais de cette chaîne depuis des années. Je ne mettrai plus les pieds."}
{"text":"I am a very frequent customer to this establishment. However, this time that in ordered using delivery, they were 20 minutes late and gave me the wrong order. When I called the restaurant to explain, the man was rude and did not give a shit."}
{"text":"Was not that impressed with this place.  The food is nearly exactly the same as Swiss Chalet, only double the price and not as tasty.  The food itself was pretty bland.  The atmophere was pretty nice though."}

{"text":"J ai attendu 20 min et personne es venue me voire même le resto etait vide et je me demandais pas pourquoi !!  Même  ma fille de 5 ans disait que C etais long!!!  Inacceptable !!"}
{"text":"Nicely located for people using public transport; in front of Côte-Des-Neige metro.
This St Hubert is really big and fully renovated.

We went on a 5-7 and i took their Home wine. Price was 6.95$ for a 1/4L Instead of 10.55$. This wine was okay, nothing big but nice to complete my meal.

I got the chicken breast and fries with creamy coleslaw. Pretty much what you can expect from St-Hubert. A tad greasy piece of chicken and fries. The chicken is still pretty damn good. 
My husband got the St-Hubert Poutine. The chicken in it was great but the spicy BBQ sauce was really out of its place for this dish. Our dessert, Mont-Choco, brownies and vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup was delicious.

Service pretty good and over all good experience of a chain restaurant. Even the bar section is pretty comfortable and quiet."}
{"text":"On en trouve un peu partout au Québec. On y sert du poulet frit ou du poulet avec des frites, voire même les deux ensembles! C'est bon mais super gras! À consommer donc avec modération."}
{"text":"Un bon petit restaurant (à viande) qui sert tard le soir (à savoir les restaurants arrêtent le service relativement tôt au quebec) donc c'est une adresse à retenir. 
Il est situé en plein centre dans la rue Sainte catherine près des musées et des salles de spectacle donc il est très pratique.


 Je ne vous parle pas du service car il est impeccable (comme toujours au canada)


 Les prix dans la tranche moyenne.
Pensez à laisser un pourboire"}
{"text":"I have been to one location before in the Quebec City area and we really enjoyed the chain. We were greeted in French and were sat down quickly. Most of their staff are bilingual in order to cater to all clientele. The decor was better here than at the other one because this one had a more retro feel to it. The menu is quite inexpensive (when converted to US dollars.) The menu is great, with many American classics as well as some Canadian inspired options. The meal starts with cole slaw with mayo or none. I got the chicken breast dinner (not the full course) which was served with a side dish. The chicken wasn't breaded, so the skin was crispy and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. It was served with delicious Texas toast and rice, which was perfect. Their pot pie was great, although a bit small. Their sandwiches are yummy, especially the one with peas and gravy. I would recommend getting a full dinner with dessert and appetizer, but their a la carte dishes are quite hefty in portion size."}
{"text":"Always good food, good service, the colelaw has always been delicious. The place is roomy and I never had to wait for a seat, not to mention their nice patio. The location in the gay village is probably the most beautifully decorated one. Oh, and their lunch table d'hôte is a really good deal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the table d'hote and the included pop was flat. When I let the waitress know she tried a different machine, that too had no gas, so I drank a flat pepsi. The fries are frozen and flimsy. I've given st. Hubert a few shots and it's never meets my expectations. This particular location has extremely slow service from the wait staff and there is even a wait at the door for a hostess to show up and seat you. The menu and check folder are greasey and disgusting from the last people who touched it."}
{"text":"Having been to St Huberts before we were surprised at how fancy this one was.  It was beautifully decorated and upscale. The food was delicious and the service fantastic. My sister said it was the best steak she's ever had in a restaurant.  We will be returning"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase...if customer service is a big deal for you, then THIS IS NOT THE PLACE! Food and drinks were subpar as well...

Boy, where do I even start with their customer service...
First off, we literally had to wait 26 minutes for the waitress to even introduce herself to us, and then once we put in our orders, we waited an ADDITIONAL 58 minutes for our food to arrive (yes, I did time it). 

Next, our waitress SPILLED red wine ALL.OVER.ME. I was wearing a white T-shirt and light washed jeans, so as you can imagine, it was extremely evident and embarrassing.  Some other worker did bring me red wine stain remover...although, I didn't know who she was/her role in the restaurant.  and just FYI, the dim lighting on the establishment made it seem like all the wine came off, when in reality...it did not.  I still have wine stained jeans and shirt.  To top it off, I still received the FULL bill, without any sort of compensation for their lack of initiative to help make things better.  #goodbyecustomerservice 
Even when they were cleaning up the waitress's mess, they half-a**ed it; wine was still all over the floor making it sticky, and they didn't even help wipe up the table.  They gave me a wet rag and napkins, but left everything for me, THE CUSTOMER, to clean up. 
I don't know if it was because I'm an American or something, but they treated the experience of a waitress spilling red wine all over me like it was no big deal.. 

I guess I should move onto the food/drinks now... 
I ordered the chicken brochette...needless to say, this was probably something that my 6th grade niece could have cooked up. Seriously.  A chicken kebob with 7 pieces of chicken, a pineapple, onion, and red pepper kebob, with a rice medley, flavorless fries, and the bottom of a HAMBURGER BUN. I do not understand the necessity of that bun being on the dish.  Food was also cold by time the waitress got it to me.  
Regarding drinks, we got the yellow beetle (wouldn't be surprised if there were real beetles in it because it tasted retched) and a margarita.  The yellow beetle looked appetizing, but it was far from tasting it; it was bitter, sour, and it was just evident that the proportions of the fruity ingredients were wrong.  The margarita, was relatively decent...if you ignore the foam that took up more than half of the margarita glass.  

Lastly, there was no paper towels in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Great place for rotisserie chicken and excellent sides to match! The restaurant itself was clean and well maintained. Parking was accommodating. There is construction in the lot next door so its a bit noisy outside.  

The service was prompt and super polite. We ordered the double chicken legs with a side of french fries and the discovery platter with loaded potato skins, onion rings, sweet potato fries and ribs - which was more than enough to share for 2 people.

The food was delicious! The chicken meat was tender and fell right off the bone. The discovery platter was a good pick for our first time ordering. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were crispy. The ribs were small, pretty much made for tasting only.  The loaded potato skins were made well, though there was more sour cream and could barely taste the potato or the cheese.

All in all, 4/5 stars says we would definitely come back again for our rotisserie chicken cravings."}
{"text":"Gave them a second chance today..they didn't deserve it. Placed my order online at 1130 for a 12pm pickup, had to wait 20 mins for it once there...and it's ice cold! Paid $1 extra for a side salad instead of french fries...open the box and its literally 9 pieces of lettuce (pathetic!) If they're trying to cut costs, portion size isn't the way to go! Maybe they should stop using 5 times as much packaging as needed and focus on quality and service instead!"}
{"text":"Le Saint-Hubert est une sorte de rôtisserie au final, beaucoup de poulet un peu partout! On y mange bien et on y boit bien! ;)


 Pr ma part, c'était \"coke diet\" a volonté ;p


 L'ambiance y est très a l'américaine.
Les prix sont plutôt moyens, ils proposent une formule du midi qui est assez bien je trouve. 
Et le service.. Comme tous les restaurants canadiens, rien a reprocher ;)"}
{"text":"Love the fruit and goat cheese salad ... but to enjoy you have to overlook the surly, inattentive wait staff.  Not a kid-friendly place. We were offered the selection of one table right by the restroom because we had a stroller.  According to the waiter, this was the only table in the entire restaurant that could accommodate children.  We would have gladly accepted the table if the dining room had been full but there was only one other table seated in the entire restaurant.  We left. There are too many great restaurants in the area to put up with grouchy, unhelpful staff."}
{"text":"The service was awful. I ordered a club sandwich and my wife and son both ordered Tuscan chicken. We waited 40 minutes for the food to arrive. My wife's chicken was burnt so that was sent back. Not a good experience considering what we paid. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"c'est st-hubert. 

les frites-poulets aussi cher qu'un restaurant francais."}
{"text":"Worst delivery service ever. After placing order at 6:52 and receiving confirmation for 7:37 delivery. I ended up calling restaurant direct and spoke with manager who assured me that my food was on the road. This was at 8:10. At 8:30 I went to the restaurant 3 minutes away, and pick up dinner which I had manager take care of. Even when I returned home, they still had yet to deliver!"}
{"text":"Bien que la plupart des St-Hubert se ressemblent, ce dernier est très bien organisé et très beau. Situé sur la 32e Avenue, il est également très accessible à partir de l'autoroute."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place just for a snack through uber eats. When I opened up my food they were missing half of the order. I proceeded to call them for the rest of my food or at least a refund but they continuously lied to me and tried blaming it on the uber driver. The uber drivers job is strictly to pick up the food which is prepared by the restaurant for delivery. Whatever they have ready, is what the drive delivers. The order cost $32 total and I was scammed of my money for $15. Don't order from this place. The food I did get was soggy and not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Very very average food, similar to Swiss Chalet, it's ok for quick lunch or dinner but nothing special.  Other member of the party didn't enjoy the food as well.  Don't go in hoping that it's going to be really good, it's a chain restaurant so expect chain restaurant style food.

Chicken is very tender, the gravy sauce is very similar to Swiss chalet.

For some reason I didn't like it very much, we were just walking on the street and just hopped in.

Took a long time for the food to come out, service is mediocre.

The restaurant is very big, it's good for a larger group of people."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on several occasions when I have visited Montreal.  The chicken is good, and the service consistent.  Great cole slaw. I always have the same, a quarter  chicken, fries and cole slaw. It is always good.  The chicken has a nice even brown skin, it has a good flavor and is never dry."}
{"text":"Great unlimited coleslaw. The location is perfect for Montreal-Toronto drivers who don't want fast food yet not take too long at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice terrace outside. The standard St-Hubert menu, of course. Service was acceptable but not overly efficient. Odd that you can only get white meat (chicken breast) on your salad, no dark meat option. Even odder that a salad comes with a side salad.... yes, you get coleslaw with any salad order."}
{"text":"La qualité est assuré, c'est toujours super bon. La grande salle est un peu bruyant et le service un peu trop vite, on peu mal profiter du moment."}
{"text":"Hair in the food. Pink undercooked chicken. Slow service. Worst St-Hubert in Montreal."}
{"text":"Avoid this particular location, folks. Served fridge-cold food, late. What the hell was that crap? Abandoned by the wait staff."}
{"text":"La serveuse est méchante elle nous lance de la vaisselle. Les bébés nous attaquent et nous envoi chier dans les assiettes. Le dj met des remix de despacito ça se voit ye calme comme le zincage de l'armoire. La madame nous apporte un poulet pas cuit elle se pense dans minecraft avec sa pioche et son dragon."}
{"text":"This was the first I was eating at a local Quebec restaurant, and I love the food with various choices, drink and dessert are included, wow, I didn't even know why:) but I like the food that I ordered and people here are very nice and sweet as the dessert:)"}
{"text":"We had a dinner with friends and family (a medium size group) but we made sure to make reservations in advance (about a week prior) and the night started off badly. We all gave our orders and waited and waited, an hour had passed and our entrees had not been served. 1hr and 15 minutes later they advised us that the main dishes had been prepared but not the entrees. So we ended up getting everything at the same time. To make things worse more than half meals were warm to cold. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the wait staff were very accommodating and apologetic for the situation. Definitely a management issue. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"As a regular visitor to Montréal (four weeks each year), I found this restaurant to be the most disappointing in the entire city.

As you enter, it looks absolutely elegant, with the stylish lighting, layout, and waitstaff all in formal black outfits.  From there, its downhill.

Service was insanely slow - and we showed up at 5:30 when there was hardly a customer in the place.  If the food was being individually prepared to order, I could forgive this - but it's not.  My partner and I each had soups, appetizers, and main courses...and each dish was bland, tasteless, and clearly commercial-grade food poured out of industrial boxes and cans and drowned in salt.  

Even the poutine - Québec's 'national' dish - consisted of canned gravy, tasteless shoestring fries, and cheese that wasn't even warm much less melted.

We will never be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This St-Hubert is a St-Hubert express, where you order at the counter, and wait 2-5 minutes to get your meal. I'm not a big fan of those express versions, as the food seems to be cooked even before you order. At the same time, it's good if you don't want to wait.

The venue is clean, and I always had a great service there. They also have some tables outside, so you can eat, and benefit from the nice temperature during the summer. I never saw as many people, but they have a second floor that you can use. The only negative thing about this place is that they don't have enough parking slots, but you can always go to the arena just aside from the restaurant.

Good for a quick lunch, or a take out as they also have a drive-through."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bangkok salad with breaded filet chicken and house dressing to go. They did provide 2 salad dressing packs. Although they did not provide any coleslaw like the other locations do. I was not asked about the coleslaw. The service was quick, but I was the only one there. I was not asked or provided with utensils. 

This was my first time at this location and my last. I give a generous 2 stars since the customer service agent named Miriam was rather unfriendly. No greeting and provided negative representation of the company."}
{"text":"Food an service were good except that I had a piece of plastic wrap in my coleslaw!!"}
{"text":"Le décor et l'ambiance sont très intimes et juste parfait pour un souper en famille. Les rôties sont bien cuits et sont servis avec leur salade Saint-Hubert gratuit. Je suggère les plats de volaille au lieu des bufs.

Le service est vraiment médiocre."}
{"text":"This is probably the most disgusting and inedible chicken I have ever tasted. I wonder how I got myself into this place. The chicken was dry, so dry that was like eating paper towel... and it was a leg!  I tried to dip it into the sauce....  puaf! it tasted like artificially flavored chicken broth thickened with cheap corn starch... not even salt... I had to settle for the coleslaw, which was good. I could not eat the \"chicken\"..."}
{"text":"Good rotisserie chicken. Loved the gravy it comes with. Great sweet potato fries. 

Wasn't a fan of the whisky bbq chicken - thought it was a bit dry. The side of rice tasted like it came from a box - flavorless and mushy. The Bloody Caesar wasn't strong at all and the coffee was burnt. Friendly waitress though a bit slow."}
{"text":"Part of St. Catherine's has been changed to be a pedestrian zone and one of the restaurants that's there is St. Hubert's. This is a restaurant that didn't do well in Ontario but still maintains a presence in Quebec. Being a fan of Swiss Chalet, I wanted my family to have a comparison basis between the two, so, I went with a friend of mine. 

It was busy on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm, and we had to wait for a table. Not an unreasonable wait. When we finally got a table, it was near the back in a large booth that accomodated us. 

Food was good, standard quarter chicken dinner with ribs. My friend had chicken and a salad. My wife had a quarter chicken dinner and my kids had the nuggets which came in a \"cab\" shaped container, they thought it was quite novel. Naturally, there is colouring for the kids. 

Refills on soft drinks were a little dicey, and I think I was charged another $3 for a refill, something they don't do at Swiss Chalet in Ontario. I did ask my friend whether it was just the fact that they were picking on us because we were from Ontario and whether as a Quebecer, they got free refills. He just looked at me like I was from Mars and advised me very politely that he doesn't ask for refills. 

The food was good and filling, portions were good for me. Prices were a little higher than what I am used to with Swiss Chalet, and even with them I think I am still not getting good value."}
{"text":"Been going to Rotisseries Saint-Hubert since I was in grade 3. Over the years their menu has evolved and, while the focus is still on chicken, they have great salads, ribs and steaks as well. 
The Cote-des-Neiges restaurant is my father and I's go to location as it is close to his appartment. 
Our server was Maryse, a lovely and very efficient young woman who was very focused on detail. I had the table d'hote which, for 17 dollars brought me a caesar salad, a leg chicken quarter, rice and cole slaw, as well dessert (I opted for the huge portion of pouding chomeur with ice cream) and a coffee.  My father ordered 2 chicken fillets with  vegetables and cole slaw. My caesar salad had real bacon which, for a chain restaurant, deserves praise. Chicken is always great: crunchy tasty skin, moist and tender flesh. Great rice and that coleslaw (traditional,oil based, I am not a fan of the creamy one) I could eat buckets of every day.
I also had a Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic which brought the total bill to about 47 dollars which is good. Needless to say, Maryse's service deserved a great tip.
By the way, chomeur means unemployed in French. Now I know why they call it pouding chomeur. This dessert (which consists of vanilla cake, cream sugar hot sauce and vanilla ice cream) is such a sweet, sugary, filling huge portion that, when one has finished it,one really does not feel like going back to work....

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Great lunch. 
Waiter was excellent !
Love the double leg meal."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience at this local LaSalle eatery. Chicken was great and service was fast and friendly. I'll be eating here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Every now and then I order from St Hubert. The food is healthier than most other options and it is really tasty. The delivery service is quick and the price is somewhat reasonable."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to St-Hubert in LaSalle. There was five adults and one toddler in our group.  The parking lot was full but there were plenty of empty tables. The was great. We had Piri Piri chicken,  chicken & rib combo and a Bangkok salad. 
Our service on the other hand was horrible. We waited over an hour before our entrees were served. Our server apologized after about a half an hour. He said there was a large dinner party going on and our food would be ready in 10-15 minutes. 30 minutes later we got our meal."}
{"text":"C'est St-Hubert... toujours la même bonne poule."}

Delicious chicken. Fast and pretty cheap. What's not to love!?

The gravy/dip is the fucking dogs bollocks. Get it!"}
{"text":"We headed here on saturday Feb 11, 2012 around 6:30pm and it was packed. We waited probably 30 minutes for a table.

I found it a little cramped. It was hard to move your chair out to sit at the table without bumping the person behind you.

We ordered appetizer-sized Chicken Rice soup, which was really good. Joel ordered the Ribs, which were very good. I had the Quarter chicken breast with fries. The chicken was just OK, the fries were a little cold. Joel liked the sauce that comes with the meal... I didn't, so I guess it really depends on your taste lol.

The service was fast and friendly, the portions were good-sized, but the wait for a table didn't seem worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"Were have eating here a lot in the past year, but tonight it was a real mess. We came to the resto at 7:45, few people inside, we had orderdd drinks, tooks 15 minutes to have them, they told us they were missing some ingrediant, but made the drinks close enought. It was fine. We ordered a brie as starter perfect, order a steak medium well, when the server brought the plate, she told me they were out of sauce, so why did the kitchen said it before and plus the steak was bloody red. Asked to order ribs, she told me i was better not, since the kitchen had to many problem.. At least my server Daphnee keep her cool and was super nice to us, not charging any drinks, so 5 stars for her and the last thing manager never show up......."}
{"text":"Went with a largish group after we found our planned-for destination had no room.

We the Bangkok and Mexican salads, a Steak, and Chicken with Fries.
Everything was good; steak-eater pronounced hers 'excellent'.
Also some desserts, which were good, but we sat next to the dessert prep station and it was a little disconcerting to see them prepared (open up a box of cheesecake, pull out a slice, sauce and serve)

Prices are reasonable.
Service, on the other hand, was not so hot. Our waiter was often nowhere to be found.  He also forgot to offer a dessert menu, and, more importantly, that some of of table had ordered a prix fixe meal which included dessert.

So good, but kinda rough around the edges."}
{"text":"Menu selection was extensive. Anything from steaks to chicken and in between. Presentation is very nice and plenty on the plate. Staff are friendly.  Albeit water is free so coming around to fill an empty glass should be considered a suggestion. Otherwise food was great and our party had different choices so we got to see an assortment of menu items. Prompt efficient service. Which was appreciated since we were on a hurry. Too hungry to snap a pic. Tres Bien!"}
{"text":"Good food but very small portions for the price. Nice to go there to hang out with friends but not a good place to hit if you're very hungry!"}
{"text":"Always curious about this place since they're all over Montreal. My partner says they're typical québécois comfort food. And they had an ideal patio to dine at on a sunny afternoon on Cote Des Neiges, so why not. We both went for the traditional roast chicken (leg) with gravy of course, along with a side of fries and coke slaw. Nothing to write home about, but fairly solid. Probably a little pricey for what we got, but we were satisfied. I guess it's comparable to El Pollo Loco in California (though El Pollo is waaaaay better IMO). Can't say I'd go out of my way to come back, but at least I gave it a try."}
{"text":"First time eating from here was delivery and everything was good but they had forgotten the fri which is obviously a pretty big mess up but they did end up offering me credit or bring it right away. Definitely a place I'll go again mostly cause of there lounge area. Calm and relaxing"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken, crispy slaw, tasty ribs and friendly, efficient staff. A relaxed but nice atmosphere. The options in Stw Julie are limited, true, but this is still an area winner. Plus, it is a Quebec, home grown tradition."}
{"text":"Table d' hote meal was a good value.

Start with classic coleslaw is yummy
Bad spring rolls
Healthy chicken ceasar and zucchini salad yum
Dessert Quebec upside down cake

Service was slow but adequate 

Not a lot like this on the US - upscale Friday's?"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant fait partie de ma tournée d'adieu de mon quartier. Nettement déçue par le livreur. C'est rapide, chaud mais qu'on insiste de me faire payer 15$ par tranche de 5$ dollars même si j'ai un 10$, 2X 2$ et 1$ sans quoi il repart avec mon repas m'a non seulement surpris mais j'ai trouvé un peu arrogant."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend to take advantage of their chicken thigh meal with a sugar pie. 

We came around 5pm on a very snowy Saturday night, so it was pretty quiet. We were asked whether we wanted to sit in the bar area or the restaurant side, and we chose to sit in the bar area. 

The service was top notch and the chicken was so tender that it really melts in your mouth! The fries were nothing special, and the portion was what's you'd expect at this price.

Now, the sugar pie is pretty delicious! It was a little too sweet and made the back of my throat a little itchy, but it was the filling was warm and the crust didn't fall apart. 

Overall, I had a decent experience. There was nothing to run home about, but I would return if I were to come with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken is a Quebecois staple, which is made great at St. Hubert.

I much prefer eating in the restaurant, as opposed to ordering delivery.  It is much fresher in the restaurant.  From a quarter or half chicken to wraps, salads, sandwiches and chicken chaud, St. Hubert has an extensive menu.  Every time I go the service is great, and it's probably the only place in the area which offers free refills on drinks.  Accompanying the quarter and half chickens are fries, slaw, gravy and bread.  It's a large portion for sure, and will run about $15 per person.  It's great for lunch, dinner or after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"It does not matter, whether I go to a location in New Brunswick, Quebec or Ontario. This is the best rotisserie chicken place I have eaten at. I have been going to then for at least 20 years and it has never ever failed me. The spicing of the chicken is amazing, the fries are always hot and crispy. The sauce is the best"}
{"text":"St. Hubert can always be a good old standby place to eat. Generally you know what you are going to get and it's always consistently a pretty good meal. We also like it as a dessert place. I give THIS particular restaurant 2 stars because despite the friendliness of the hosts and wait staff it is always so slow and like one of the other reviews cited, you might feel like you were seated but then forgotten.  I blame management and training for this kind of lame treatment. There are several other places in the area serving just as good meals at similar prices, who are happy to have you there, and you won't be chasing someone down for service."}
{"text":"Bon, il est vrai que j'y vais réguliérement mais c'est toujours pour des diners entre collègues car c'est l'un des rares endroits décents prêt du bureau. Service, nourriture et prix ok, sauf parfois dans la section bar ou nous le services et un peu mieux qu'ok. Pour du vite fait, bien fait, dans une location supérieure à la moyenne des St-Hubert."}
{"text":"Everyone has a tradition, and going to St Hubert is my tradition whenever I travel to Quebec. The chicken is dry and the skin is moderately flavourful. The service is usually adequate with a tone of delay. However, it is hard to beat the value of a $6.95 rotisserie chicken (quarter) with mashed potstoes and coleslaw. Besides, this place might just turn into a Swiss Chalet by the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Great place, modern hip look and a great bar with friendly service. All around a great casual restaurant for dinner to please everyone."}
{"text":"For a hall reservation. the service was very slow.  Food-wise, the chicken breast Provençal was bland, nicely accompanied with frozen vegetables.  Could have made a better dish at home."}
{"text":"Was taken here for dinner. It's a Montreal chain, family-type of retaurant but it's a good place for a low-key dinners with friends as well.  The outside was already crowded for those who wanted to take in the music from the French music festival...apparently you needed to reserve the spot.

We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3 and here's what was ordered:

-quarter leg chicken: chicken was moist, definitely tastes better with the sauce. Also came with fries and weirdly, half of a hamburger bun (that yes, that's better with the sauce)
-chicken rib combo: the ribs are so much better than the chicken!
-combo platter with jalapeno poppers and chicken wings: I'm a sucker for jalapeno poppers so that was the only one I enjoyed

The food is alright. They're known for the chicken...or maybe it's the sauce? Feel free to ask for more sauce because they will bring you more and it will make your meal tastier!"}
{"text":"The service was average, the food was less than average.  We ordered 2 hot chicken sandwiches and they weren't even hot!  For both orders the gravy was cold, we could have made a fuss and sent it back but we didn't.  Instead I'm leaving this review and won't waste my appetite next time :)"}
{"text":"Always reliable St. Hubert.  OK - so this place isn't for everyone - they're definitely a casual rotisserie restaurant, located all over Montreal.  Canadians familiar with Swiss Chalet will find many similarities although to be honest, this place is much better.  It appears they are re-branding and trying to appear more upscale - it'll always been a great comfort food for me..

Service on our most recent time was fairly slow but we managed to always get his attention if we needed it.  St. Hubert always seems to be running affordable specials and this time was no exception.  We tried the winter special and the Hub meal with a starter and dessert - both came out as expected.

The food is above average but by no means fine dining.  It's good value and generally very tasty.  Always satisfies as craving when I visit Montreal.."}
{"text":"I always look forward to stopping at St Huberts when I'm in Quebec.  I seem to have some affection for this province as i require a dose of chicken from here along with other regional favorites every time I'm in this province.  Once again they dont disappoint.   Everything was spot on, hot and fresh.  We ordered to our hotel, it was delivered quickly, and everything was included that we ordered, woo hoo no missing items.  Love this place."}
{"text":"While travelling you seek out comfort food, and this was an old favorite so when we came across this joint we couldnt help but stop in.  The meal was delsicious and the ambiance was better than expected so as we travel i hope to return.  The chicken is classic, and my son loves their poutine"}
{"text":"Had the \"Boite Surprise\" (\"Surpise Box\") which I'm told used to be called the \"Choix du Chef\" (\"Chef's Choice\") and it did not disappoint.  It indeed was a surprise.  I guess they changed the name so any disappointed customers wouldn't blame the Chef.

Quarter chicken leg meal... more like a QUARTER BOX meal since the piece was so small, that's how much space it took up in the take out container, which by the way contained a tray that was tapered at the bottom.  Found the chicken to be saltier than other roast chicken places.  Maybe they marinate it in brine before roasting.  The downside is that salt is its predominant flavour.  The fries were crispy and actually not bad.  Switched the salad for an extra gravy which I didn't really need but this man needs meat, not salad, and he got neither.  Still, for those with decent appetites or meat lovers, pay for the more expensive chicken breast meal instead.  After all, there's no time to eat lunch twice.

Overall, something different from the Swiss Chalet I'm used to but seeing since there must be some anti-competitive agreement (no St. Hubert in Ontario, no Swiss Chalet in Quebec) between the companies, it's likely Quebecers are stuck with whatever St. Hubert decides to dish out.

Prices are a little on the expensive side but simply put where else are you going to go for chain restaurant roast bird.

P.S.  From what I've been told, that mysterious one half hamburger bun comes from the fact that it used to be a whole hamburger bun being used as the bread portion of the meal, until the company cut back and started giving one half the amount."}
{"text":"St. Hubert is quite the brand in the Montreal area. We saw express restaurants downtown, products in the grocery stores, and a street and airport named after the person. The logo is silly and based on the location downtown, I assumed it was a fast food chicken place similar to a Boston Market. It's actually a sit down restaurant very similar to a 99 with a more limited menu. We got the express lunch and it was pretty good. I got the dark chicken and it was served in a different way but one that reminded me of my childhood as my mother used to make hot chicken sandwiches in the same style: thick bread, chicken inside, smothered to death with gravy on top and topped off with peas. Pretty tasty though. The meal came with dessert and I tried a sickly sweet vanilla cake topped with caramel while my friend tried a pudding that tasted very similar. Would I go again? Well, there are tons of places I'd try first just because I don't go to Montreal every day (or ever) so probably not but I definitely recommend trying it to others visiting."}
{"text":"Average food. Nice patio spot. This is a chain, and has bland offerings.  However the cole slaw is good, comes with any meal, and is 'all you can eat'."}
{"text":"I will never ever order st Hubert again.

I've been to two locations recently one on New man to sit in and eat and i was terrible the chicken is the worst thing ever it just had a funny taste and this location is the worst of them all.

January 1st decided to have a nice order in meal and watch a movie.... wrong!

From the weird little piece of fake tasting chicken to the burnt bun to the poutine with extremely old cheese on it (made me sick btw) they put a poutine in a box... not a bowl or a container in the box. Not one bit of love was put in to this meal and that's what's sad. Ordered wings teriyaki got dried burnt cold old wings. Cmon you guys have to get something right. 51 dollars for 2 meals and the wings were 20! Had to call back and ask for new ones not even the dog would eat it. 

St Hubert has gone down hill extremely fast and it's very worrisome.

I will never order from here again stay far away"}
{"text":"Service was great and quick.

I went for a late lunch 2-3 pm, the place was pretty much empty which was fine with us. 

They have a open kitchen concept now so you can see what's being cooked more.

They have a guy working in a glass box I'm not sure if it's for the drive thru or the entire restaurant but looks hot in there.

The chicken isn't the same as it used to be and they changed one of the wraps I eat, they put Swiss cheese which ruins it, used to be chicken Cesar salad wrap.

Only came here because it was on the news recently.

When I asked for my food to go, my coleslaw and gravy were both left out of my take home container (rude as I barely touched it)"}
{"text":"Well that sucked!

Decided to grab two wraps to go because who wants to cook Sunday night ?

Not only were they slow to make it as I was the last order the staff I saw was just eating stuff with their back to me. Pretty rude.

The wrap was tiny super disappointing. And a rip off of money.

Food made us sick so that wasn't the best.

UPDATE: Manager called to apologize super sweet and I respect a restaurant caring about feedback. 

I will be returning just not at night time lol"}
{"text":"Food and drink service was friendly but extremely slow. It almost felt like they forgot about us. I ordered the chicken roll which was pretty decent. The cole slaw was tasty. Shared a pitcher of the orange ginger mojito and it just tasted like a creamsicle. I don't think there was any ginger in it, and it did not even taste minty like a mojito at all. Did not realize it was a chain, otherwise probably would not have went here."}
{"text":"It's a good place for your chicken cravings. Coming from Ontario I need to say that it's better than Swiss Chalet. Salads are very good and the fries have that European taste. Well priced and excellent and friendly service."}
{"text":"There's no denying that if you want a quick and inexpensive lunch or dinner, St-Hubert BBQ is a good place to get it. Nothing on the menu will blow your mind away, and you won't have a culinary experience, but they make a good bbq chicken and coleslaw. The ribs are too sweet for my liking. I prefer the dry-rub style of ribs. The fries are average.

The service is very good and friendly. The decor was nice because it was pub-style St-Hubert. Ultimately, the food is/should be king and it's not. If you want a great bbq chicken go to a portuguese-style rotisserie. You'll have a much better experience for the same money."}
{"text":"There was nothing special about this place. Mediocre food, watered down drinks, although the service was goo and the kids meal come in a car box. I got the ribs which were dry. It's like a nicer version of Friendly's.The restaurant was clean and looks nice."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of St. Hubert in general, but the last time my parents suggested it I went with a half-rack of ribs with whiskey sauce, mashed potatoes, and regular coleslaw. I tend to prefer the ribs to their chicken, although if you like chicken skin, theirs is pretty tasty. 3 Stars means A-OK, right? And that's how I see their food, good, but not great - and not something I'd ever really crave. There are so many other choices in the city, so I might get food from here once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Five stars for convenience, three stars for food. The place has a takeout counter with lower pricing than the restaurant. There's a drive through and a decent sized seating area in the main restaurant. For takeout, the hot food comes in a box with a paper dinner plate. The cold food comes on top in a bag. They take credit cards and are fairly inexpensive. The only downside is that the food was fairly mediocre. Not nearly as good as Brook's Chicken in Oneonta."}
{"text":"For those having heretofore accepted St-Hubert's, the context then calls for an abridged review. It's chicken in a box. Every poultry in all of it's location are one of the same kindred spirit. It's the same brown gravy and fries. It's reassuring."}
{"text":"Wow... What a bit of disappointement. This chain over the years has lost its mojo. The chicken was not that juicy and the poutine was plain awful. Cheese curds had a artificial taste to it and stale.  The staff and location was great. The 3 stars are for them."}
{"text":"They have improved a lot over the past few years - bigger portions and better variety on the menu.  What i like about this location is the drive through!"}
{"text":"Hey! They renovated the restaurant!
Well we walked in at 7pm and there was no sign anywhere to wait ro be seated but we still stood there waiting for anyone to acknowledge us...at least 5 waitresses passed us by without a single look, then the hostess came to seat us but put us in a secluded area away from anyone even though I specifically asked to be seated amongst the crowd. 
Then she acted very annoyed that I made her seat us elsewhere.
Then the wait started for a waitress to come take our order but no one did for at least 10 minutes.
No glass of water, nothing.
Someone then said \"it won't be long\" and ran away even though I was asking her a question.
Disorganized.
It's not that they are understaffed, there must have been 6 waitresses working the half empty restaurant. 3 tables around us were full of dirty plates and no one seemed in a hurry to clean up any of it.
The new decor is very bleak.
Lots of black and gray which is the colour of indifference, like the staff.
They closed the kitchen wall where we used to be able to see the cooks, they probably decided that they needed to hide the mess that they do in there. But the mess in the dinning room is exposed for all to see.
Never again.
I rather eat elsewhere.
Which is what we finally did."}
{"text":"Je ne vais plus souvent dans une rôtisserie St-Hubert. Il est vrai qu'il y a 40 ans, c'était une des options faciles pour manger du poulet rôti. Aujourd'hui, à Montréal cependant, il y a une légion de rôtisseries portugaises qui servent un meilleur poulet à meilleur prix.

Reste que mon fils (15 ans) qui guérit d'une mononucléose avait le goût du poulet et de la sauce St-Hubert, alors nous avons fait un effort pour le satisfaire. J'ai trouvé le service à ce restaurant inférieur à la moyenne des St-Hubert et mon quart de poulet cuisse était plus petit qu'habituellement (je ne sais si c'est un hasard ou s'ils ont réduit leur standard) et servi pas très chaud.

On peut se consoler en se disant que le stationnement est gratuit."}
{"text":"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. Supposedy this is the place you go to get Roast Chicken. They even have take out.

Requested the 1/2 chicken dinner with Ceaser salad,  garlic toast and coleslaw. Large menu of chicken, wing, sandwiches, salads and the No. 1 Roast chicken. The coleslaw came first, kinda bland with no bite, who left out the raisins. Now when you go to a rib place this is the first item you get. Hmmm that is some good cole slaw, that is what you expect. I told my partner in crime I like the stuff better at KFC. The ceasar dressing was missing something, garlic yes that is it.

I was saved by the chicken, moist and tender. Yes it was extremely moist and they had this litght gravy (I'm not a big gravy person). Hats off to the cutie watiress Stephanie who spoke great English (I thought she was from somewhere in the East Coast). Everyone seemed to speak  French."}
{"text":"Summary: service sucked and the food is okay. Not worth going out of the way. If you are in front of this establishment, and everywhere else is busy, then stop in.

Went with la femme for dinner. Her choice. Ordered classic and creamy cole slaw (from the wife's meal since she doesn't like cole slaw). Creamy cole slaw was decent, didn't care much for the classic. Then again I like my cole slaw sitting in the juices and getting a little soft, just a personal preference. So what, everyone has different tastes.

Ordered the club burger which was actually chicken (grilled or breaded, whatever Canada. You call a chicken sandwich a burger all you want. We still love you like a little brother). I found the chicken sandwich okay, a wee bit dry and cool. The poutine for the side was overloaded with cheese and cold. I'm no aficionado, but the couple times I've tried at other places here in Montreal, it was warm.

Normally I would give a three or four star review (if I stayed for drinks the rating would be up there). But the service was less than impressive. No silverware on the table when the cole slaw was brought out (they serve as a starter I guess?) which sat in front of me until the meals came out. It was (I imagine) the manager bringing the food, not our server. We ordered drinks then when the drinks came we ordered food from the server. She didn't check in with us until after the meal came out, despite me trying to call her twice to ask for silverware. When I finished my St Germane and tonic (it was meh, like drinking perfume) my glass wasn't cleared and I wasn't asked if I wanted another drink when she did come back. By the time we were finished we were asked if we wanted drinks. Disappointed in the service and underwhelmed by the food, I wasn't interested.

We waited 20 minutes for the check while our sever organized menu's and cleared her tables. I don't know if they were short staffed, bus boy called out (if they have one) or if we were just getting ignored (which felt like it watching the other three tables being served)."}
{"text":"The menu of this place is in stark contrast to the decor which was adult and stylish, the menu was sort of the place that you'd take your 7 year old niece for her birthday, chicken fingers and ice cream sundaes. When our waiter delivered our two appetizers, it was clear that the salad we got had been sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long. Why would our waiter not notice this and do something about it? Not once but twice, our waiter delivered our food to other tables before realizing his mistake and the restaurant was certainly not busy. Empty water glasses and never delivered sodas was the theme of the night. Our french fries were obviously old, the chicken breast we got was soaking in some sort of thick herb sauce to obviously mask the poor quality. From the fact that we sat nearly the entire meal next to three tables that had piles of dirty dishes to the totally inept waiter or the fact that both me and my dining companion left with stomach aches.....this place is just screaming for Gordon Ramsey to come in stir some sh*t up. You've been warned."}
{"text":"The chicken is good, price is right, speed/service is subpar due to an abundance of customers and an inadequacy of waitstaff. Employees work hard, but you can see it on their harried faces, they need more bodies on the floor for noon rush. Lunch combos featuring entree, soup or dessert, unlimited coleslaw and one of coffee/tea/pop run $10-15. Come before noon and if you're still there when 12pm rolls around be prepared to wait and wait. 

Might return, but not for lunch peak."}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped at St. Hubert's, a Canadian franchise, to get dinner. It was late and not crowded at all. Not that that mattered, since we went straight to the express window to get take out. Though it's called \"express\", that's misleading since you have a small wait for your order to be prepped.

Prices were somewhat expensive for what you get - chicken, french fries, bread[1], and LOT of gravy[2] - but they take credit cards in case you don't have enough cash.

Dipping sauces are available upon request. Get the BBQ or mustard sauces if you're not into gravy.

[1] Expected a biscuit for a side, not a McDonald's hamburger bun. Amusing.
[2] For reals, that was a crapload of gravy. For a few pieces of chicken, I got two large plastic containers of gravy."}
{"text":"Similar to other st.huberts but a little nicer inside. The food is as good as usual but nothing special. I got the hot chicken with white meat and fries/coleslaw, which is usually my go-to dish; never fails with creamy coleslaw.

Food: 3/5, classic hot chicken with gravy and peas, very québécois. The fries were ok.

Service: 2/5, kind of slow and just ok

Ambience; 3/5, a little fancier decor and nice music but it can get a bit dark 

Price: 3/5, $20 per person if you get drinks, not bad for Swiss chalet type of food."}
{"text":"I actually had a really great experience here a couple of weeks ago for a family dinner. The waitress was very nice, seated us right away, had no problem serving us in English, gave recommendations when asked, great job! She wasn't very fast on refilling our drinks but hey, no one's perfect.

Food-wise, we got the creamy coleslaw to start. We got the club sandwich with chicken breast for 2... the chicken was a little dry tbh and if you're really hungry, you're better off getting your own meal. 

The piri piri chicken my bro ordered was delicious, think I'll order that if I go back next time! Good experience at this renovated location."}
{"text":"I found the chicken small and way too salty and the vinegar coleslaw a bit too vinegar-y. We received mediocre service when we were there but hey the location was convenient and it was open quite late so it hit the spot."}
{"text":"St. Hubert has delicious food but my biggest complaint is the lack of servers. I came here on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all but there were two waiters and one hostess and they had an entire restaurant to serve. At one point all of them were at the bar mixing drinks and there were times we could not find a waiter. Dinner ended up taking THREE HOURS from start to finish. 

The food was delicious and pretty fairly priced. I got the meal that came with unlimited soda and dessert for $20. The chicken was tender and had amazing flavor. My volcano cake was good too. I had unlimited soda but because the waiter never came by, I only had two cups. Also the waiter never offered me cole slaw or the option to change my sides. He didn't give a shit, really. 
 
P.S no matter how curious you are, do not order the BBQ Ranch cocktail. You will throw it all up. It's absolutely disgusting. The drink tastes like cold chicken. 

P.P.S the waiter was delicious so I forgive his slow service 

P.P.P.S there was a homeless lady we watched from the window that was hustling people for money. At one point she was pushing people so that made for good three hour entertainment."}
{"text":"The delivery is the best among all. It's fast, food is warm and well cooked. Delivery guy is super nice."}
{"text":"I'm in town for the weekend and had dinner here tonight. I was seated at an outdoor table promptly and everyone was polite. My food came out in shocking speed, literally minutes after ordering. I had ordered the grilled chicken/salad/yogurt sauce entree and a glass of wine. The server was wonderful and I really enjoyed a great dinner."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars for one thing: simplicity (and also because I've been going there since I was a kid). St-Hubert is a rotisserie chain and yes not the best place for vegetarians. 

The restaurant was recently completely renovated. Overall it looks good and it appears there is more space for tables. Finally, they pushed the bathrooms further back and there is no more table right next to them (where I was seated multiple times and it was quite unpleasant). Little problems in the bathroom: only 1 out of 3 faucets was working and my friend and I never understood how we were supposed to lock the doors...

The location is essential for this one: right in the Quartier des spectacles and so it is always busy and surprisingly efficient. On a Thursday night, my friend and I had tickets to the ballet at 8PM. We hoped to be seated around 6:30. 

Every evening, especially on \"concert nights\", you must expect the place to be packed, with a line. Hence you have to get there early. I arrived at 6:10 and I was told I would have to wait AT LEAST 20-25 minutes. There must have been 8 groups of people before us. 

We got a table at 6:40. We didn't take too long to order our food and we had finished our meal by 7:20. We had plenty of time to get a dessert, which is probably the best thing on their menu, because they have a lot of options. Tourists, you have to try the sugar pie (i.e. maple syrup pie). 

The food itself isn't fantastic, especially the fries. They are never particularly crispy. Overall, there's a lot of salt in the food. Not mind-blowing experience, but if you have a show in the area, St-Hub is a simple and fast option. It is definitely a kid-friendly place. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Franchement décevant...Alors qu'avant c'était un resto sympa, les propriétaires ont changé la direction du restaurant, passant d'une ambiance familiale à chic-surfaite. La nourriture n'est pas mauvaise, mais loin d'être un bon ratio qualité-prix."}
{"text":"Installations design, très réussie et équipe de salle professionnelle agréable. Très bon accueil."}
{"text":"The ribs are really good, pretty much the only thing I eat there and their gravy is great too. I guess if I had one suggestion they could improve on, it would be their opening time, I would like to be able to get ribs before 11am."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here for a business lunch. 

The meal came with a chicken breast, fries, a roll (half a burger bun), and gravy. The chicken was very tender. The gravy was pretty tasty, great for dipping the chicken and fries."}
{"text":"I grew up getting St-Hubert at least once a month as take-out. I always preferred their chicken and sauce to Swiss Chalet (a big debate amongst student at my university).

During our last trip to Montreal, my fiancee and I were feeling hungry and I decided to take him to St-Hubert. We ordered a quarter chicken each, with french fries and a side of coleslaw. I made him dip EVERYTHING in the sauce and he loved it! I wish there were restaurants like it in San Francisco- quick, yummy, and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Terrible!! Took two hours total. Over 30 minutes to get drinks because of \"someone training in the bar\". Wings came with no sauce then given cold BBQ sauce on the side. We were charged $26.50 for the $19 build your own three course meal and $29.00 for the $24.00 meal. After waiting so long wasn't worth disputing. Will never go to another St. Hubert!!!"}
{"text":"WOW ! Ils ont complètement rénové ce restaurant. C'est à mon avis le plus beau St-Hubert !! Parce qu'ils sont dans un complexe de bureaux, le service est très rapide, assuré par une prise en charge rapide des serveurs. Le décor est sobre et contemporains, je vous suggère fortement la zone St-Hub, qui est la zone bar de l'établissement. La qualité de la nourriture est digne de St-Hubert... toujours très bonne et standard."}
{"text":"Ok food. 
BAD service. 
Sassy staff that takes forever to bring you anything even if it's water or cheque. 

Restaurant wasn't busy at all. So a bit of a buzz kill if you have to wait 30 min to get a drink while eating. 

Step up your game hennies"}
{"text":"Si l'on veut du poulet, c'est un classique, on ne se trompe pas avec du St-Hubert. Là bas, nous sommes accueillis avec le sourire. Le service est rapide et l'endroit est décontracté. Les portions sont bien équilibrées, ce qui fait en sorte que le rapport qualité prix vaut la peine. Petits et grands vont y trouver leur compte."}
{"text":"Rage de côtes levées, c'est là que ça se passe.
Belle succursale avec une salle en location au sous-sol, un bar à côté et un service express.

Notre serveur était des plus sympathiques. 
Les repas que nous avions commandé étaient tous excellents, rien à redire."}
{"text":"Love the poutine with crispy chicken. It's the best. They also have good salads and the service is quite good."}
{"text":"Had to stop at this place on our way to Mont Tremblant as we are from Alberta so we don't have these chains. The chicken was really good. We had a couple wraps and shared a poutine. The poutine was really good too; the gravy perfect"}
{"text":"If you come to Quebec and don't try a St.Hubert (a very popular chain here) somehow I think you are really missing out. The BBQ chicken is excellent. The service irreproachable.  Arguably one of the best chains of family restaurant in the Western world."}
{"text":"A friend recommended(born & raised in Montreal) this \"incredible chain\" to me, during my visit. It was a \"must go.\" So before my concert at the Bell Center, we bee-lined to the closest St. Hubert we saw. We had 1.5 hours to spare, before the 7pm concert  - plenty of time. 
WRONG.

nothing,ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about this place impressed me. IF i didn't know better and took this place to be the representation of Montreal, I would have left right away.

Nobody greeted us. 
They wiped the table after we sat. 
Nobody spoke to us, let alone explain the menu items. 
We were dying for a cold mixer (we're all passionate about drinks) but nobody asked.

I don't think I've ever had such a salty soup in my LIFE - it was like drinking salt water - 2:1 salt - but could I let that be known? no, because nobody came to check on us. Tables around us with French -speaking people were check often but we were not - we don't do this, in Toronto - just avoiding Francophones? it's not heard of.

The chicken was good - the sauce was no Swiss Chalet, but it was pretty good too. by the time we were done eating - we had 30 minutes to concert time. Of course, nobody would even make eye contact with us.
Even when we got up, dressed to go - nobody came. We had to go ask our tab to be closed - as you would do at take outs.
So in the end , we were 30 minutes late for the concert.

I'm glad I knew better than to take this place as a representation of Montreal - and thank goodness our dining experiences improved during our stay for my first timers to Montreal.

DON'T VISIT, IF YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. was the message I got from this restaurant. I will bite my tongue on that."}
{"text":"No greeter, sticky icky table - seriously need refinishing, service was meh, the food was alright (St. Hubert  is St. Hubert) - I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and got Pinot Noir (whatever). And the best part....wait for it...was the itinerant guy urinating out side the widow - Bon Appetit! They must be getting used to serving drunk hockey game attendees.  Never again."}
{"text":"Pour le lunch avec une amie.
Restaurant de chaîne mais pour le midi il y a le menu-go qui est rapidement servi à prix raisonnable. J'ai pris la soupe repas aux légumes avec poitrines de poulet aux fines herbes. Soupe très chaude pleine de légumes. Ne semble pas avoir été préparée sur place mais quand même bonne. Mon amie elle a opté pour le rap au poulet et frites de patates douces et a aimé. La salade de choux est toujours fraîche et bonne. Le service fut rapide et amical. 
Le seul bémol est que la salle de bain de la section bar puait l'urine."}
{"text":"Le plus récent restaurant de la chaîne à ouvrir. Super déco moderne. 
Belle terrasse confortable avec du chauffage au besoin.
Entrée méli-mélo très bien et mon 1/4 de poulet poitrine etait très bon et chaud. 
Bon choix de vins à prix raisonnable. 
Le service etait impeccable 
Stationnement facile."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas un avis très original sur une rôtisserie St Hubert mais j'ai bien aimé mon expérience à ce restaurant.  Premièrement, je suis allé après 20h dans la section bar appelé le St Hub. Il y avait seulement une autre table d'occupée. La musique était rock mais pas assez pour donner à l'endroit une ambiance d'un jeudi soir. Le jeudi en plus les dames ont droits à des spéciaux sur l'alcool. J'ai commandé un apéro, ensuite le traditionnel quart de poulet poitrine avec Poutine. Tout était bon, juteux et chaud. Au milieu de mon repas, les clients de soirée arrivent enfin pour donner de l'ambiance au bar. Des femmes pour la majorité. Ce que j'ai trouvé de remarquable ce soir la c'est le service. Non pas que j'en ai pas du bon chez St Hubert d'habitude mais ce soir fut exceptionnel. Du début à la fin le service de ma serveuse fut sans faille..suggestions de plats, d'apero, vient voir après avoir servit mon assiette si je suis satisfait etc. Je vous dit , la perfection. J'ai jugé bon d'en parler."}
{"text":"Pour un souper vite fait. Bon poulet très chaud avec salade César. Bon service au comptoir avec le sourire en plus."}
{"text":"Repas froid, eau chaude dans les verres. Vaux la peine seulement s'il y a une promotion."}
{"text":"Yikes. Fast food in a restaurant. So the fast service and the pricing is good. I probably won't go back. There is a good decor but not very English friendly. I know they speak English. I was going to say well I'm a visitor but wait. No I'm not. This is Canada. CANADA. Deal with it. Just separate already. But you don't get our land. 
The hamburger buns as a side dinner roll is so lazy and insulting.  Go get some bread people. Ribs are steamed and slathered with too much sauce. It's embarrassing to prepare such a famous cut of pork this way. There should be a rib police and fine people for mistreating pork. I'm just so disillusioned with what this place pretends to be it's unappetizing."}
{"text":"We finally just left. Never got service after watching our waitress gab to her friends for 15 minutes. Nice."}
{"text":"I tried their special at the time, which was the bbq chicken poutine. It was actually okay, but a little strange. The bbq sauce was a bit too tangy. The chicken was okay, and the fries were just like frozen fries.

The server threw our complimentary coleslaw onto our table and spilled a bit of the coleslaw juice. Our service was a bit subpar.

If you're going to get their signature chicken dishes, that would probably be a more solid option to pick."}
{"text":"The place is great, like the other st-Hubert! The staff was accommodating. The decor of this one is nice and modern. 

It's a go to place if you want traditional style chicken. It's not the quality of Ramados nor Cyrano on st-Viateur, but the quality is there and is always there. Kinda expensive tho... for what it is. I would go there for business or with big family reunion, but if you are alone with your girlfriend, think agin..."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Ordered the leg dinner and was accompanied with a side of poutine (as requested), and coleslaw. 

Chicken was crispy and delicious. Service was great as I was in no rush. If you're in a hurry, maybe pass on this place. 

Sauce was tasty and spot on. Really reminds me of a Swiss chalet competitor with more modern furnishings and fixtures. 

All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Je ne me tannerai jamais de manger du St-Hub. C'est mon enfance le St-Hub. Le goût est constant, les prix sont abordables, l'ambiance est un peu bruyante, mais fallait s'y attendre avant un show au centre Bell!

Le quart cuisse, je ne m'en tannerai jamais et moi, je c'est toujours crémeuse!!!"}
{"text":"Livraison rapide

Par contre les repas sont souvent bâclés sur la livraison, pot de sauce remplit à moitié, poulet trop cuit et sec. Dommage"}
{"text":"One day when I'm really really rich I'm going to buy all of the St. Huberts in the world and shut them down permanently. This place is so awful. Everything about it was so wrong, the food is gross, the waiters suck, the drinks were hard to swallow, and it wasn't even cheap! Never never never ever ever ever again."}
{"text":"Cold, wet and exhausted Krista M and I realized we were in front of this St Cat's St Hubert. This is like a classy St Hubert with a hostess and nice big windows, but really you're getting what you always get. Medium caliber rotisserie chicken, ribs, deep fried cheese bites and things like that. But the truth is, a pitcher of beer and some roasty and greasy things are sometimes exactly what you need and this joint on this particular night definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We were on our way home and feeling lazy so we hopped in not realizing the time until we hit the door. It was about 11:05 and although their doors were unlocked, their schedule said they closed at 11 pm. The dining room waiter was still more than happy to seat us and even directed us to use the take-out counter once realizing we we're looking for the food \"to go\" as the price from the takeout counter is lower on what we were looking to order. By the time we got to the take out counter (you need to leave the restaurant and walk to the back of the building) it was easily 15 minutes after they had \"closed\". The manager on duty processed our order and we we're happy to be fed! My absolute only negative comment would be that we only wanted the food and no drinks, but selected drinks after we were made to feel that they were included despite them being at an additional charge on the bill."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and i had chicken fingers with 12 French fries, yes 12 of them I counted them. They work really fast and slack off."}
{"text":"I like coming to this St-Hubert when I am in the city, its cozy and really nice. The waiters are friendly. Depending on the days service speed varies. Food doesn't always come pipping hot, fries are cold and soggy."}
{"text":"These places are a classic. Can't go wrong. My fave one is the one in Lasalle. Never disappoints, very good drinks too."}
{"text":"Ce qui est bon de cette succursale est qu'elle est proche du Centre Bell donc on arrive plus tôt avant le spectacle et on prend le temps de souper. 

Rien de différent des autres St-Hubert. Le menu et la qualité de la nourriture est la même. 

Toutefois, tout est à air ouvert et c'est très bruyant. Comme nous ne sommes pas les seuls à penser à venir y casser la croute avant un spectacle, le rush est assez intense, les serveurs courent partout. Ôtez-vous de leur chemin."}
{"text":"Not the best Rotisserie Chicken in town, but it's good enough when you are hungry. This location has an express take out window that is nice and quick. The chicken is passable and the coleslaw is pretty good, you can get better."}
{"text":"Casual yet elegant ambiance. Nothing extraordinary, but no complaints! We spent 2 nights in Montreal. Stopped here on a whim. It was mostly empty at about 3pm Saturday afternoon. Waitress was friendly. Food and drinks came quickly. Although my drink was so full of ice and lemons, there was hardly much liquid! Coleslaw was served before our meals, and was very good. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Gravy and mayo on the side were a nice touch. My boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken club sandwich. Both meals were overall satisfying. Price for two meals and two alcoholic beverages came to approximately $40."}
{"text":"Very confusing lunch menu.

I came here with a few friends and we all decided to order from their lunch (special?) menu.  From what I read (the English menu), my meal would come with coleslaw for the price as listed and I would be able to pick a side, so I decided to go for the side salad since I did not consume any vegetables for the past week or so.

After explaining to the waitress what I wanted in English, she said it would be fine and we soon got our meals shortly after.  The food was mediocre and I would have given them 3 stars if it wasn't for their mistake on the bill.  

The waitress had misunderstood my order and charged me for the extra side salad even though my menu item was supposed to come with the coleslaw in the first place, and a side salad as a side.  Her English wasn't too great and I honestly did not have time to argue, so I ended up giving a mediocre 13% tip and leaving the restaurant quite discontent, knowing that I paid $16.50 for a very sub-par meal."}
{"text":"Faudrait réellement que les gens de la banlieue comprennent à quel point ils paient trop cher leur poulet pour une qualité correcte alors que dans des places comme Piri Piri, le poulet est délicieux et beaucoup moins dispendieux ! Je trouve le St-Hubert très ordinaire et les plats qu'on y sert manque souvent de goût et de nouveauté! Tant qu'à manger au restaurant, allez ail"}
{"text":"C'est un St-hub, donc vous savez à quoi vous attendre! L'endroit par contre est superbe et ils ont une énorme terrasse, donc pour l'été, c'est parfait :) !"}
{"text":"Meh.  This place feels like a chain as much as possible."}
{"text":"Love St Hubert.    Great salads, sandwiches and various other menu items.   The grilled chicken is moist and tasty !!    Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I love St Hubert, their roasted chicken, their salads, their appetizers...everything is good. 

This one is located in the Village with a nice outdoor seating area.

Solid food, good service."}
{"text":"J'ai acheté un choix du rôtisseur pour emporter, le poulet et la peau n'était pas assez cuit. Les frites étaient vraiment sec. Le pain était aussi très froid. La salade de choux n'avait aucun goût. Je suis loin de recommander ce restaurant à quelqu'un d'autre"}
{"text":"Delicious, this is the place I remember as a kid, but this time it's all grown up!

This is not your typical fast food chicken place, this is a legendary Montreal institute that has become a success chain with delicious well prices good food.

They have several locations and this particular location the staff spoke limited English but it wasn't an issue they tried really hard to speak English and it made me practice my French.

All in all good value for decent food!

I believe you can even buy their chicken seasoning to bring home with you so on can create your own 'St Hubert' chicken."}
{"text":"Environs are great, pretty and warm. But the food I mean..way tooooo slow, it just chicken and some brown sauce how could it takes more then 45 min? Really? And the service was horrible. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Good family place to go. Halal chicken, the saint-Hubert poutine special very good taste! Have kid area to play in and the food is good. The original taste always sane since the opening in 1974. Love to go there to past a time in family very friendly service."}
{"text":"Seems the reviews are up and down, but while in town we stopped in for lunch and it was some damn good chicken.  I came in with a group and we were quickly seated, drinks delivered and orders placed.  I ordered the quarter chicken breast with fries.  The rotisserie chicken was served up hot, and the skin had just enough crispiness to make it taste just right.  Overall, I have to say it was good and is especially liked the chicken gravy or whatever little cup deliciousness that you can dip your chicken in.  So for me, not being a local, and my first time ever in a St Hubert's, I had a good experience with the staff and thought it was some damn good chicken.  It was a nice spot to grab lunch and I would go back."}
{"text":"I must be honest and say that I was always a tried and true Swiss Chalet kind of person. You can read that as \"English\" or \" ex-Torontonian\", both would be true. But I'm also the \"festive special\" kind of person who enjoys the stuffing and cranberry sauce that comes with the Swiss Chalet meal over the meat pie that comes with the St. Hubert meal. And lets face it, it usually comes down to the sauce. They are both salty goodness and I'll be happy to dip my hamburger bun or dinner roll into each, respectively. 

But this review is actually about St. Huberts, limited time only, lobster roll. Yes, 4 star lobster roll. Truth be told it might even be a 5 star, but I feel sacriligious going that far. 

Let's start with the portion. 17$ for a full St. Hubert meal, complete with a generous lobster roll, we're talking sausage size roll, no greasy steamy buns here, FULL of beautiful chunks of fresh lobster. The mayo dressing is super light, just enough to keep it all together, and the seasoning totally respects the delicate flavours of the lobster meat. There are a few tiny chopped vegetables like celery and the usual suspects, but there as a garnish,  not as mass producers to fill the roll. And oh yes, the roll. I was delighted that it was large, fresh and lightly toasted with just a hint of butter so your hands aren't dripping with grease after the first bite.

Once you have gotten through the roll, you may actually be full, but as I am a champion eater, I was on to the accoutrements that you will normally find in all of their chicken dinners. Fries, gravy, no hamburger bun mind you, probably because you just had a full sausage roll, and the traditional style coleslaw for me please   :)

A very satisfying meal. I will make sure to indulge again before the limited quantities run out."}
{"text":"It's St-Hubert. An institution in Montreal. Good chicken, good service. Its a good place for a quick lunch on weekedays."}
{"text":"Nous somme venu manger dans cette succursale, un vendredi soir avant un spectacle de danse, sans trop vraiment s'attendre à grand chose. Le restaurant était plein, mais on nous a très vite installé à une table. La serveuse était très sympathique, elle a mis un peu de temps à venir prendre notre commande mais c'est compréhensible quand il y a autant de monde. Nous lui avons demander qu'est ce qui prenait pas trop de temps à faire vu qu'on était un peu pressé, elle nous a très bien conseillé et à forcer notre commande en cuisine. Nous avons pris un wrap au poulet croustillant accompagné d'une patate au four et un burger de poulet accompagné de frite, c'était pas transcendant mais bon et chaud comme il faut pour cette nuit de début septembre. La salle était quand même bruyante mais l'ambiance sympathique."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! Wonderful set up, looks very nice like you should come dressed up and it has wonderful views of the city. As the name suggests, Rotisserie chicken is their specialty. It was moist and flavorful, the gravy was the star of the meal I think; It was bursting with flavors and a slight spicy kick. With your meal you had endless coleslaw; yup, aaaaall the coleslaw you could ever want! 

The only thing I found was that their molten chocolate dessert wasn't all that great and the coffee was very expensive and yet pretty blah which was surprising since all the coffee I had tried in Montreal up to that point had been spectacular! I only drank half of it, but overall I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"C'est pas de la grande gastronomie, les tables sont des fois un peu bancales et le service est correct mais pas professionnel.... 
Mais mes enfants nous laissent pour une fois manger sans trop d'interruptions, des fois même on peu avoir une conversation entre adultes (en parlant de choses d'adultes) quand ils vont dans le coin télévision !!!!! Et ça mes amis ça n'a pas de prix!!!!! 
Merci St Hubert!"}
{"text":"Good food, affordable prices 
, good for kids, they enjoy their time especially when a clown is present. All chicken dishes are are fresh as expected from a rotisserie. I would liked their portion to be bigger. The traditional dishes are always good , however some of innovative / new ones are complete failure ( no taste or combination that does not work together). Service is usually good and fast, however we tried it on a friday might and dishes tool forever as restaurant was packed ; despite  this stuff were always friendly and helpful. Recommend it for casual lunch /dinner and fir families."}
{"text":"Depuis la nouvelle administration, j'aime vraiment beaucoup le restaurant. Le service est une grosse priorité et ça se fait sentir. La nourriture est excellente et , même si vous n'êtes pas fan de poulet, il y a quelque chose pour vous. 

Les drinks sont excellents et la bière à une bonne promotion durant le 5@7. 

Mon plat préfèré depuis récemment est la poutine St-Hubert. J'adore le mélange des sauces bbq et \"poutine\" et aussi le poulet est excellent. 

Je commande souvent en take-out mais sinon c'est un excellent endroit où manger avec un service efficace."}
{"text":"Ce St-Hubert est à éviter si vous détester les files d'attendes et les endroits surpeuplés. Oui, le resto est bien placé près de Centre Bell, mais tout le monde s'y précipite pour une bouffe rapide avant un match ou un concert. Je suis venu ici avec 3 autres personnes dans l'espoir de manger vite, mais le service a prit 45 minutes avant d'apporter nos assiettes. Le serveur, complètement dépassé par les événements, trouvait des excuses pour tout. Il a même blâmé un manque de patates frittes aux cuisines pour expliquer le délais dans nos commandes ! Lamentable ! Les prix sont relativement abordables, mais je ne suis pas épaté par la qualité et le goût. Il y a de bien meilleurs rôtisseries à Montréal.

Je ne recommande pas. Il y a bien d'autre restos plus agréables près du Centre Bell."}
{"text":"D'habitude, je ne suis pas un fan de cette chaîne de rôtisserie, mais je dois avouer que ma visite dans cette jolie succursale de la 32e avenue m'a agréablement surprise. D'abord, le décor style lounge est tout simplement génial. On se croirait (presque) dans un resto trendy du centre-ville. De plus, le nouveau menu offre des plats assez diversifiés et intéressants. Mon choix s'est arrêté sur une salade au fromage de chèvre chaud avec morceaux de poitrine de poulet grillé. Un petit délice à un prix abordable. Ma conjointe y est allé pour le classique quart de poulet et n'a pas été déçue. L'endroit offre aussi une table d'hôte du soir et un menu midi rapide lui aussi très abordable. La section bar propose des prix spéciaux sur les consommations durant le 5 à 7 qui semble cependant connaitre un succès mitigé puisqu'il était vide lors de notre passage. 

Je retire une étoile à ma note en raison du service qui était un peu lent. Après nous avoir donnée notre facture, la serveuse a disparu pour un long moment. J'ai dû parcourir le resto à sa recherche pour enfin pouvoir la payer. 

Si vous êtes dans le coin et qu'un poulet rôti sur la broche vous tente, je vous recommande cette succursale."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 12 of my extended family. The servers were extremely nice and patient with our massive group! 

The table starts with Cole Slaw for free. got the salad jardiniere and found it a bit boring, but I think it's because it's not my usual type of salad. The club burger was a bit small but my brother enjoyed it. I thought the Bangkok salad with crispy chicken was very tasty!! My cousin ordered the \"half chicken\" and got something she wasn't expecting - it was essentially chicken between two slices of bread covered in gravy. I thought it was good but she didn't like it!

This was a good restaurant option for us because we were a big party and needed lots of space! If I were on my own I would have gone somewhere smaller and more traditional, instead of a chain."}
{"text":"I come here often for take-out. I appreciate the quick service at the take out counter. You know what to expect from chain restaurant food, mediocre. That being said, this outlet gets a 4th star for the service."}
{"text":"Le service étai pourrie la serveuse étai bête elle ne m'a pas emporter la bonne commande et elle ne c'est même pas excuser de son erreur elle a dit que ctai de ma faute elle parlait dans mon dos à d'autre employer"}
{"text":"St-Hubert normalement c'est un classique et on sais a quoi s'attendre, pas cette fois-ci, service hyper lent, nourriture tiède et sèche après avoir attendu au plus  45 minutes entre l'entrée et les plats.
Service incompetent, salle de bain sale. bref à éviter. 
Suis un client régulier de la chaine et ce resto de la chaine n'est pas à la hauteur.
À éviter.... moi je n'y retourne certainement pas
Pitoyable

{"text":"They have their menu down to a tee. Obviously, this rotisserie specializes in chicken and thus you should obviously order chicken but they have a decent variety of things you can try...thought I never have because let's be honest... when I eat at a rotisserie known for its chicken, I absolutely want their chicken.

Their chicken breast is very good, their chicken thighs are even better. I even had their chicken salad and it was pretty good as well. The fries are consistently good, the gravy is solid and the creamy coleslaw quite excellent.

All for very economical prices that are pretty hard to beat.

Service when ordering is always efficient and quick... which is a huge plus for me. Deliveries are so quick that it actually impresses me, considering the quality of the food received in no way shape or form loses any value compared to ordering from within the resto.

All in all, a solid place to get your chicken from."}
{"text":"I don't have anything particularly negative or positive to say about this location everything was just sort of okay. The location was clean and our server was friendly and patient as we were a decent sized group and he got everyone's order exactly right. They have a lot of space to seat groups and they do have outdoor seating in the back. outside of that though the prices are decent  , the portion size wasn't bad and the food itself while fresh wasn't overly flavourful or standout in any way. Most people got the chicken platter with fries and a few of us had their special chicken sandwich. The sandwich itself wasn't huge and wasn't bad but didn't have much flavour , i chose a house salad as a side and while the greens were fresh the salad dressing was horrible. I would stick with the classic chicken platter and fries if I were to come back here. This place  isn't my first choice in terms of recommendations but is conveniently located near the bell centre if ever you need to grab a bite before a show."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken is pretty good, but overall I'm not sure why this place is so popular. Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids dined out and it was about $50 (gulp) all said and done. Service is usually friendly but wait times for food can vary quite a bit.
Coleslaw is fine, and I don't really understand the half-hamburger bun added onto the plate as a \"dinner roll\". The rotisserie chicken is pretty much the only thing worth ordering on the menu. We have ordered other things on the menu but they were usually dry or tough.
I will say, though, that the restaurant is very kid-friendly. They provide a colouring page before the meal, and children's meals include a beverage, side, and dessert. There is also a small play area, although I should note that it is kind of sad...with very few and/or broken and worn toys. I understand, though, that one night a week there is a magician or balloon animal guy that visits tables.
I'd say it's not a bad place to come every once in a while."}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service was terrible. 

The restaurant wasn't busy and was enough staffed but we had to wait 25 minutes before a server came to us, we had to go take the menus ourselves, the food took another 30 minutes to be brought to the table (fries were cold), I asked the waiter not to bring one of the elements of the dish, Wich he brought, I ordered 2 other things Wich he never brought us. 

The server was unfriendly, not smiling, he never came to check on us how the dinner was. Once we were finished we wanted to pay but there was just no one around, after 30 minutes I asked another server Wich sent our server, he brought the bill but never came back with a card machine for me to pay, after 15 minutes I asked the hostess if I could pay, she was friendlier but asked me the waiter name, which I had no idea as he never introduced himself.(all I know is he had a grey beard).

The service was bad and therefore did not deserve any tipping, I'm happy to tip from 10% when the service is avergage and go up to 25% when it's good to excellent. The waiter asked me twice if I was aware that tip wasn't included, I replied yes and got ready to leave (he should have understood that if a customer doesn't tip it means something was wrong). Once I was out, he came back towards me and asked again from the terasse if I was aware that tips wasn't included (wasn't I clear when I said yes?) I repeated yes and had to tell him that the service had been bad for him to stop annoying me more. Instead of apologizing for the service he gave me a very arrogant facial expression.

I understand tips are an important part of the waiters salary and it's not an easy job but if you choose to do it you need to deliver an acceptable service at minimum. Although it's a common practice, tipping is not mendatory and is at the discretion of the customer and his satisfaction."}
{"text":"What a great lunch!!

I had a spinach goat cheese salad--a mix of julienned veggies, grilled chicken, croutons, and a lemon olive oil dressing. It was a hot day, so sitting in the window seat with a fresh, bright salad was perfect. My only complaint would be that if you got too much dressing in one bite, it was a little too tart.

My fiancé got the whisky BBQ chicken. The gravy is absolutely fantastic. Chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Definitely something to get excited about!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice seemed recently renovated, service fast and courteous. I found the hot chicken sandwich tasty however portion was disappointing my friends portion seemed larger she had chicken leg which was really seasoned and tasty her plate came with vegetables and rice(pilaf rice was very dry). 
Would I got back? Only if Scores which is across the street was closed. I get more bang for my buck and confidently know I'd be full!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to St Hubert last night for the first time ever as we had never been! 

The food was good(still a fan of Swiss Chalet) and I would come back. 

We had the Mozerella sticks, 1/4 Chicken White Breast dinner, with maple/caramel pudding for dessert. 

Service was a little on the slow side, but to be fair they were EXTREMELY busy and there was the Just for Laughs festival going on. 

All in all is give it a 6.5/10"}
{"text":"It's a big place and there was a wait to be seated on a Saturday night. I was told that this is the Swiss Chalet of Quebec by a friend so I had to try their ribs and chicken with mashed potatoes. Their ribs sauce and gravy definitely isn't as flavourful as Swiss Chalet but the meal and service overall was decent."}
{"text":"St-Hubert serves food that's easy to please- I mean, who doesn't like chicken right? It's very conveniently located right at Place Des Festivals and always booming with tourists and locals in town for a special event or show.

Unfortunately, the food is rather bland and service is lacking.

Their classic rotisserie chicken for which they are supposed to be known for is often dry (chicken skin wouldn't peel off nicely, it was all dry and stuck) and portions are extremely small. Not sure what kind of chicken they use, but if I order a quarter leg elsewhere, I see a big difference in size.
It's not just the chicken, but pretty much any side you get with it, you'll get very little. The equivalent of a small handful of fries, or if you want rice, looks like they use an ice cream scoop to measure it out.

Yes they do have unlimited cole slaw, bread and sauce - but it's only as much as they will serve you. Because service is often slow, it's a hassle to search for your waiter and they almost make you feel bad for asking more.

There are times where the service is fast, but not in a good way, and this is usually on an evening where there's a big show at Place Des Arts. The staff  is aware that many people will need to be done by a certain time, so they practically chase you out and give you the bill before you have time to ask for dessert.

I wouldn't bother with dessert anyways, the fact that they have an open kitchen, you can see how the food is prepared and they use microwaves to reheat their cakes.

Once I came with my family, busy like always, they couldn't even get us proper drinks. Soda was flat and warm, the glass was colder than the drink itself.

Food quality is inconsistent, portions are a joke. I never leave there feeling full or satisfied. St-Hubert is only loosely worth it if you go to an Express restaurant where the prices are slightly cheaper and you don't have to tip."}
{"text":"Was at a meeting in a Dorval office. We decided to order delivery from St. Hubert bbq. What a horrible mistake! 
The club sandwiches were cold and awful. The chicken was dried out and tasteless, the bacon, what little there was of it, looked and tasted like it was made days ago. The \"fries\" looked and tasted like cardboard! We threw everything out! It was vile!"}
{"text":"It's alright but they don't accommodate vegans or vegetarians, everything has meat, even the salads."}
{"text":"Depuis que St-Hubert a été vendu et qu'il n'est plus québécois, la nourriture est digne d'un fast food. Oublions le bon poulet et les belles assiettes qui nous étaient servis autrefois, la nourriture goûte le synthétique et le tout fait à la va vite... Frites congelées et poulet aux hormones, le bon goût d'autrefois qui a fait sa réputation n'y est plus. Je ne retournerai plus jamais chez St-Hubert. Quant à la succursale où j'ai été servi, je n'ai rien à dire du service et de l'accueil, ils étaient à la hauteur."}
{"text":"Service is fine, food tastes good and it makes for a nice place to eat. 

Pretty traditional family friendly joint that is similar to Swiss Chalet. Not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"This place was insanely busy when we arrived near the end of the lunch hour. The restaurant had a back room to accomodate our large group. It was a nice touch with the room having a glass door, so the noise of the restqurant was blocked out. 

The service could have been a little better but our orders came out corectly and we got refills so I can't complain too much.

The food was standard as you would expect from a chain restaurant but it seemed to taste that much better because it's one of those places you can only visit when you're in QC.

I personally enjoy St-Hubert more than Swiss Chalet, but I know there's many more people that would argue that point against me."}
{"text":"I have just come from St. Hubert on St. Catherine.

It is without question the worst meal I have had in 9 months.  The potatoes ..what were those?  The vegetables.....what were those?  My chicken was so processed...what was that?

My friend had the Mexican Salad...and instantly felt sick.

We complained to the manager Pierre....who said he would do something and then offered us tea?   We were in shock they would not compensate us properly (meaning comp the meal)  for such a horrible meal - neither of us finished our plates.   

The waitress...Genevieve....was wholly unsympathetic....but we tipped her 3.50!

This isn't French-Quebec.....this is shit. 

St. Hubert....u need to CLEAN house.

UPDATE (9:40pm): I just 5 minutes ago vomited all my food up - I am calling them in the morning."}
{"text":"This was such a great experience. I haven't been to St-Hubert since I was a kid. They used to have a location in Misssissauga in my neighbourhood but it is long gone, so it was a treat for my friends & I to visit. The food was amazing. Unlimited buns & coleslaw (creamy or vinegar) and the chicken? House sauce? Superb. I forgot the name of our waitress (sorry!) but she was on top of everything, didn't miss a beat and made sure we were well taken care of (thank you ). This restaurant is nothing like Swiss Chalet, and you HAVE to try it for yourself. 

St-Hubert, don't ever change! You're beautiful the way you are!

P.S. Come back to Ontario!

{"text":"When I come to Montreal, I absolutely have to stop here and I it never fails to make me swoon. I always get the chicken with gravy and this time I got the side poutine. Absolutely delicious. I got my meal to go and the service was slower than I'd have expected for drive-through, then again you're getting a rotisserie chicken so it can make sense. Bottom line, I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service on Mother's Day, par Sabrina. 
Chicken was good, and really nice touch from Yves Rocher with a lipstick for every Mother there!"}
{"text":"Decided to sit at bar instead of table. Outside patio looked inviting but sun was hitting just right of building windows across the street and I hate to be hot when eating. 

If you order anything but beer to drink, it seems to be a game of what might I get.  Ordered an Old Fashion. Bartender had to look up on her phone how to make. Then proceeded to let me know she couldn't make one because they didn't have cubed sugar. Let her know simple syrup works just fine. Once I got the drink it wasn't bad but she didn't muddle. I can deal.  Food finally came but all bartenders seemed to disappear. Finally I got the lone bartender to get another drink.  Ordered the same. She brought basically straight whiskey. By the way, they do not have any Ryes and only whiskey is Canadian Club. It's OK when mixing.

Food was ok, but nothing to come rushing back for."}
{"text":"Have not been to a St-Hubert in over a decade. They used to be in Ontario, but slowly disappeared over the years. Guess they couldn't compete with Swiss Chalet, which also does rotisserie chicken and ribs. Hubby had a craving as we were leaving Québec and it was well past lunch time. Need I justify further? Ok then...

Pretty quiet inside with a few people at the bar to the left of the dining room. And only a couple people at tables. Hostess led us to a nice cozy booth. Our server was gracious, friendly, smiling and while not completely bilingual, her English was still better than our very rusty high school French. She said they have a special lunch deal... if you order a lunch entrée you can get a soup or dessert as well. Spousal unit went for ribs and dessert (some big cookie). I went for the cream of chicken soup to start. It's supposed to be homemade, but something made me think perhaps they used a salty premix base and just add extra chicken? I might be wrong, could just be their recipe. Little less salt, little more cream would do the trick. Then I had the chicken wrap. Yes it was a lunch portion, so smaller than most wraps, but I probably got as much chicken in that as some people do elsewhere for dinner. Big, moist chunks of breast meat with a bit of spinach as a liner. Quite delicious. Coleslaw was included too. Went with \"traditionale\", which had a little more vinegar than I prefer. Creamy next time. Oh yeah, I'd be okay with coming back."}
{"text":"As very picky NYers we didn't know what to expect we sat outside for lunch and the chicken club blew our doors off, don't skip the dipping sauce! My husband and I shared the deux club (for two) and then went back for their St Hubert Caesar because we wanted more chicken and the club couldn't be shared. We started with the veggie spring rolls and they were fried goodness with a nice Thai sauce. This restaurant has existed for 65 years and for a great reason, 3hr rotisserie chicken. Don't expect fancy just come hungry and you won't be disappointed. Next on my list is the chicken with sautéed apples, bacon, and Oka cheese...Merci Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. Sometimes on dates, other times for class dinners and sometimes with friends. 

I usually go for the table d'hôte. It gives you A LOT of choices and it's so cheap!

The service has been pretty amazing every single time, so I'm very happy on that front. 

The fries are sometimes a bit boring, but hey, they give a ton of fries, so I can forgive it. 

The chicken is always cooked perfectly and last time, I had the hot chicken (basically a warm chicken sandwich that's doused in gravy) and it was quite good! Personally, I still prefer the regular chicken thigh, but I'm happy I got to try it. 

Their sugar pie is to die for (figuratively of course)! It's a huge portion and it is very quite sweet, be prepared to drink some water while eating. 

They often have coupons (online or in the mail) and they offer amazing deals, so look out for that.

Can't wait to go back again!"}

{"text":"Tres grande salle à manger avec banquettes , coté bistro, coté terrasse, soleil ou à l'ombre, bon service, standard food."}
{"text":"Big place ! Coté resto et coté bar aussi. Bcp de mirroirs, service attentioné. Bouffe correct, j'aime la salade de choux cremeuse offerte par la maison."}
{"text":"Cette chaine de resto traditionnelle et symbolique chez les familles quebecoises m'a déçu avec les années.  Elle a déjà annoncé qu'elle utilisait des poulets nourris au grain et soudainement elle a arrêté.  Elle n'offre aucun repas végé et encore moins vegan. Le St-Hubert sur St-Denis est fermé et c'est tant mieux."}
{"text":"Toujours bon c'est une tradition et c est fou comme les serveuses sont belles !!!
Service très rapide et courtois. Toilette propres pas trop bruyant et éclairage adéquat plein d écrans ."}
{"text":"Resto qui fait la job: j'ai faim, ils ont de la bouffe. On ne parle pas ici de gastronomie, mais plutôt d'un bouche trou relativement abordable. Un lunch copieux incluant repas principale, soupe/dessert pour 14$ incluant le pourboire. Ce n'est pas mon endroit favoris, mais quand j'ai un temps limité pour manger c'est parfait. Le service est rapide et courtois, la terrasse est bien située, ensoleillée et dispose de nombreux parasol."}
{"text":"Services impeccable nourriture toujours bonne les serveurs et serveuses toujours ben gentil et gentile 
Bon choix d'entrées et de plat 
Bonne carte de boissons et vins"}
{"text":"Super soirée en amoureux avec bouffe réconfortante. Le menu a évoluer et propose des variations intéressantes. Le tout accompagné de bons cocktails."}
