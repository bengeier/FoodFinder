{"text":"I love this place! We always go to the lunch buffet and it is wonderful. They keep the naan coming and all of the dishes are so flavorful. Also the tea they serve at the buffet is amazing! Whenever I go to an Indian restaurant it is hard to know what to order so the buffet is great for newbies who want to try everything. Every time I come in the manager comes by to see how everything is and the rest of the staff is great. One time I went in right before they were suppose to close (without knowing) and they never rushed me, even though we were those last minute customers."}
{"text":"Great buffet! My family and I came to visit ASU and throughly loved this restaurant! Must go to if you love Indian food."}
{"text":"Well, I used to LOVE this place. I love indian food- it's my absolute favorite. The food is really good here and reasonably priced and is in a good area of Tempe for students . The vegetarian dinner is delicious and the garlic naan is AMAZING. I wouldn't usually come for the lunch buffet because it's a little less spicy than I like it.  A few months ago they hired this new waiter who is completely incompetent. He's super awkward and had us waiting for ~35 minutes to take our order and another ~20 for the food. The crazy thing is that the place was totally empty when we got there! There was one other couple. The food was good (as usual) but we were so turned off by how long everything took that I gave the guy full tip but wrote \"bad service\" on the receipt, thinking maybe he just needed to know that we noticed he was just standing around and taking instead of taking our orders and serving us. I always tip well because I think people under value their servers, but jeez this guy was terrible!!  So then we go again a few weeks later and apparently he remembered us because he started talking to all the other people who work there about how we were rude when it came to the check (maybe he forgot that I tipped him 20%?) and we had awful service again and he made someone else who worked there serve us. It was so incredibly awkward that I felt like hiding under the table and we haven't gone back since. It's really sad because this was one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food always great! The lunch buffet is my favorite, and the lunch time service is excellent...rarely do I ever have to ask for water or more naan. One side of the buffet is all vegetarian so I never have to worry or ask if something has meat. The naan is so always soft and hot!   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, attentive service,very reasonable prices. What's not to like? Well, the table at which we were seated needed a bit of attention to its cleanliness. Otherwise I would have seriously considered five stars. But that was minor; I'll be back at first opportunity."}
{"text":"Delhi Palace Cuisine of India is open 7 days a week. Located in Tempe, AZ near University and Rural Blvd, this restaurant features authentic food including raita, naan, palak paneer, chicken masala, garlic naan, spring dosa, tandoori chicken, chicken tika, papadam, mint chutney, basmati rice, dishes with lamb and more. After visiting for over 25 years, we still enjoy the hospitable touch and delicious meals on a regular basis. The best way to try it is to come to the buffet with a generous amount of choices from salad to dessert, with Indian milk tea included!"}
{"text":"I'm a south-asian so I know my indian food and this place has been the best I've had so far. The lunch buffet is the best, the naan service is prompt and frequent, the taste of musical ambiance is trendy, the price is cheap compared to the quality of the experience."}
{"text":"The overall food was good taste wise but my stomach was full as just after I had one naan. Then I found out the reason being they added too much of (baking) soda in the food. In addition, the hotel staff was also not polite while talking. Even if we ordered starters first everything is served at the same time. So what's the meaning of appetizer? That was my first time and the last time I had been to this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best Indian food I've had so far. I usually order aloo matar with basmati rice and garlic naan. When I ask for medium spice its medium spice, when I want it spicy it is actually spicy! The flavors are spot on, the service is excellent, I have no complaints! It's simply the best so far! Yum! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! I just went to a place rated 4.8 stars and I realized, after finishing my (so so) meal, I have been spoiled by dehli palace!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far, both ventures for the afternoon buffet. The second trip came recently to confirm the quality as I remember being blown away the first time, and had another great experience. I am excited to start eating here more often as it is on the way to school.   Until like 2:30 pm, they have an all you can eat buffet for around $9, and a guy like me is fully capable of devouring 3-4 entrees in order to get full. So this is the basis for my review as I may or may not make it in for dinner any time soon due to my schedule.   I started the game picking out a little sample of everything offered, and then was planning to take it from there eliminating what I didn't like as I went up for seconds. I absolutely loved it all, but only went back up for a few items due to being (surprisingly) full. Although I enjoyed the grilled veggies, I would have to put them on the side next time as they didn't mix well with the chicken curry and masala items. That was my bad though, as I had chosen... poorly with my plate composition.  I will gradually update this review as I learn more info about the dishes, I plan to start going here a lot for lunch and will be more vigilant about what is what."}
{"text":"A group of us ate here about 3/4 weeks ago and while I cannot fault the food, which was delicious, I would NEVER set foot in this restaurant again because of the sheer rudeness we experienced from one of the waiters. Normally I would complain but we were that shocked that we all left bewildered. I spoke with anither colleague a week later and he said he and his wife experienced the same behaviour. There is no way that the management can be unaware of who I am refering to as they stood out like a sore thumb behaviour wise as I found all the other staff extremely pleasant. Sort it out as there is no shortage of excellent Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet (which ends at 2:30, just FYI). Although the food options were pretty limited, everything that I tried was very tasty! I liked that chai tea was included. We had no trouble with service, as everyone was pleasant, our water and naan were refilled throughout the meal, and tables were bussed promptly. I'd come back, but for $10-11 each, not very often. I'd rather try out some other Indian buffets that offer more."}
{"text":"The waiter is extremely rude. He is always frustrated. He once shouted at us for not being able to decide a curry to order. It looks as if he is forced to do the job. Please get rid of that guy if you really care about your restaurant."}
{"text":"Can here with friends for lunch and had the buffet. For the price and selection it was pretty good. There was a really vast selection of dishes and desert. Not sure what dinner is like here but I'd certainly be open to giving it a try.  The service was also pretty good for it having it been lunch hour."}
{"text":"Rude and arrogant waiter. Doesn't have the decency to talk properly. When asked something while billing the cashier banged my card on the counter and went away to get someone else. Doesn't matter how the food is. Service is so horrible. Will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Not great. Okay food, decent service, and it's next to campus, so that's nice.. The food and service at Taj Mahal are better."}
{"text":"The only reason Delhi Palace gets 5 stars is because it was my intro to indian food. Now i have to eat indian food several times a month, and if you ask me to eat it more than once a week, i'll do it. I'll even eat it more than once a day to spite you. I'm addicted and i blame Delhi Palace. I don't NEED you, Delhi Palace, i just WANT you!   It's not my favorite indian food place, but it's my \"indian food baseline.\" Every other indian food place is compared to Delhi Palace. It's like eating mom's meatloaf. You may not even like meatloaf, but you'll eat it when mom makes it because it's your mom and she'll make you sit at the dinner table until it's all done, anyway.   Wait, what? I think you know what i mean, don't play dumb.  No, really though. It's not the best, but it's definitely awesome."}
{"text":"Do not let the location and outside deceive you. I was instantly impressed as soon as I stepped in by the decoration and the servers. The buffet line wasn't huge but it was good enough for us. Food was good and service was first rate."}
{"text":"If there were negative 5 stars I would have given them those. The incident happened on Thursday 02/25/2016. I and my friend went there at 4.50 pm to buy samosas (carry out). We placed the order in the front counter. We were in a hurry and at 5 pm I went up and asked one of the waiter (in the front counter) how much time it would take and to cancel the order if it is late. The waiter behaved really rudely and said it would take 5 more minutes. Later on he was constantly taunting me. At one point he came over to our table, offered water and then just walked pass without even pouring the water in our glass. I got really pissed of him. The order finally came at 5.20 pm and I lost my calm and said it didnt took 5 minutes. He had my credit card in his hand which he threw at me and said just take the samosas we wont charge you. I said no we are not going to take it charge the card first and I am going to complain this attitude. Then he did charged the card and we left.  So the main thing -- PATHETIC SERVICE. I hope they have cameras at the front counter and the owner can see what their waiters do when they are not there. Wont be going there ever.  Avoid this place. No courtesy and their food is pathetic. They should go and learn how to offer appropriate service from a neighboring Indian restaurant \"Curry Corner\" (which has way better food than them)."}
{"text":"This place was nicer than I thought it would be.  Had lunch there today with a couple of friends.  Of course, we all decided on the buffet.  I also ordered some mango yogurt drink which in itself could have constituted a meal.  The drink was delish! The other thing I enjoyed was the endless supply of naan!  The few buffet items I tried were very tasty and am bummed that I could not sample the others.  No complaints about the food.  The buffet plus drink totaled around $13. Keeping that in mind, I probably will not return due to my very frugal nature."}
{"text":"I was astonished. I moved back to Tempe and was looking for good indian food. Someone in my class recommended this place and I am so happy they did. I always got chili chicken and garlic naan at my old place and Delhi Palace's version was even better. I am a raving fan! They even gave me garlic naan"}
{"text":"After reading all of the really positive reviews of their lunch buffet I decided to try eating here again.  The food was much better than the last time I ate here, yet still nothing to brag about.  While the sagg and other veggie dishes were quite good and would deserve around 4 stars if judged alone, the meat dishes, naan, and other parts of the buffet were not nearly as delicious."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and freshly made. The only reason I give a 4 and not 5 is that the food was served 30-40 min after we have ordered,We forgot the 'wait', after the food arrived though.  It seemed utmost care was taken for each item and everything seemed perfect. We ordered vegetarian thali, veg biryani and soup and it was a fulfilling dinner.. Loved each bit of it.. Ambience was ok.."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the price is a bit on the unreasonable side. Also the inside decor, specifically the linens on the tables are a bit outdated."}
{"text":"Anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds. I know Indian food I grew up in Asia. Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.  I went to the buffet. I received bland, room temperature food  with undercooked meats.  There are good indian food restaurants in Arizona this place is just not one of them. Go to The Dhaba which is just up the street"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Was honestly blown away. The food was some of the best Indian food I've had in the states. Tender chicken, delicious curry, and perfectly baked Naan. If you're a fan of Indian food I highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"I love Indian food! And I've had a lot of Indian food regularly though out my life in many countries. Delhi Palace Cuisine serves very good North Indian food it's as simple as that. It is reasonably priced too.  I went there for dinner with a few friends of mine after one of them boasted \"I'll take you to the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix!\" He's probably right.  We shared the food so had the beef biryani which was very good, the chicken tikka masala which was great, its a creamy dish as it's supposed to be but they didn't over do it as some places do. so don't feel guilty about ordering it. The Tandoori chicken was excellent and I'm picky about tandoori chicken. They have  a decent vegetarian section but I only tried the Palak Paneer & it was some of the best I've had; even though it's not usually my type of dish.  I didn't like the Ice tea though, it tasted like it had some special spice or something but serves me right for ordering Ice tea at an Indian restaurant. The garlic nan was good too.  The atmosphere is typical for lots of indian restaurants. It doesn't feel like a cafeteria or anything like that but it's not going to impress anyone or wow your date. But it's comfortable, relaxed, unpretentious and true/authentic to the type of restaurant. There were a few indian couples around; always a good sign.  The service was excellent; they didn't interrupt the conversation as I've found happens too often in US restaurants these days, But they were always there; prompt ready to serve & respond. I didn't feel rushed either.  In a nutshell, if you want to experience tasty authentic north Indian food and enjoy your meal & company check this place out. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My dad is from India and until now, I haven't been able to find a place in Tempe that could stand next to his cooking. Even though he'd never want me to admit it, Delhi Palace is just as good! The Aloo Gobi was AMAZING and the Chicken Tikka Masala was great (though I probably could have handled a bit more spice). Definitely get the garlic naan, as no meal is really complete without it.   The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars would have to be the price. I've heard they do have a great deal on their lunch buffet, so I'll be back again soon to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant in the East Valley.  The garlic naan is better than anywhere else, and the palak paneer and aloo palak are unmatched.  Portions are average to above average for the price.  Waiters never leave your water glass empty.  The servers used to be very polite but a bit severe and serious, lately they seem friendlier and more open.  Regardless, the food is wonderful and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, been eating here over 2 decades. The staff is excellent, very helpful and friendly. The food is also very yummy. My wife loves their chai."}
{"text":"One of my first experiences with Indian cuisine, and I couldn't have asked for better food. The paneer masala was delicious and I've made this a go-to restaurant with friends. Keep up the great work! Fantastic food and great service."}
{"text":"I've been going to Delhi Palace for almost 15 years. The quality is always excellent.  Update 2-14-2016: I'm downgrading my 5 star review from Aug 2015 to 3 stars. The food is still excellent, but they have recently gotten new service staff that at best they can be unfriendly and at other times down right rude. There is one server in particular who is just awful.  On one occasion we were there and this awful server was walking an elderly couple towards the back wall to be seated, a pretty far distance from the buffet. You could tell that the couple was having a hard time moving around and the elderly woman asked if they could sit closer to the buffet and the server said no and sat them down. The place was practically empty and there was plenty of seating closer to the buffet. After they sat down, the elderly man asked a different server if they could move closer and this server reseated them.  Another time we went there and restaurant was even less busy. The same rude server tried to seat us in the buffet area where we'd be next to all the traffic at the buffet line as well as all the customers coming in and out. The main large dining room was practically empty, so we asked if we could sit there. The server wasn't happy, but begrudgingly took us in and then attempted to seat us at the table nearest the entrance to the kitchen and the hall to the restrooms. We asked again if we could sit somewhere else, and he put us in the farthest corner of the restaurant surrounded by high chairs, were we had a hard time getting in and out.   Other times we've been there and we'll ask a question and get a short response, or greet someone and get a cool response or no response at all.  The staff that has been there a long time still recognizes us and greets us warmly or gives us a friendly smile. But the newer servers act like they are doing us a favor by letting us eat there. And even though the food is good, the service doesn't make for a pleasant experience anymore.  So I give the food 5 stars and the new servers 1 star, for an average of 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm going to separate my review into two parts for the reader's convenience. First is lunch, second is dinner.  Lunch: Great, cheap north Indian food buffet, highlight is definitely the Chicken Tikka Masala. The lunch buffet has a large number of options, though, so if you're feeling adventurous, go nuts. After a few years of eating here, I have one piece of advice for you: avoid the goat. I've never had a visit where it's tasted good, and with so many options, why ruin the meal? The price is fairly cheap for an indian food buffet of this quality, and when you factor in that it is all-you-can-eat and that the naan is limitless, Delhi Palace's lunch buffet is a thing of legends amongst the ASU community.   Dinner: This takes the food of the lunch buffet and makes it better (and it was already good to start!). Plus, you get to customize the spiciness of pretty much all the dishes, and you get a much larger variety of foods to choose from. Pro tip: If you are authentic desi and want desi spice, you'll need to really make sure your waiter knows. For people who aren't fond of eating raw jalepenos, stick to medium or lower. Prices for dinner can get expensive fast, and service is often slow, which is why I am giving this place 4 stars.   TL;DR Lunch is cheap, plentiful, authentic, and tasty. Get Chicken Tikka Masala, avoid the goat, capitalize on the infinite naan. Dinner can get pricy and slow, but tastes twice as good as the already good lunch buffet, with three times the variety. If you don't like licking hot car doors in the middle of the summer, order medium or bellow spiciness."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years and wanted to come back because I had good memories of this place being really good. However, we were very disappointed. The quality and taste of the food had diminished and the service was a bit odd. The server wasn't attentive and the taste of the food we ordered (chicken vindaloo- bland; samosa- disappointing; and lamb curry- bland) were not what we remembered it being. Will not be coming back here anymore. At least there's many Indian restaurants around the valley to try..."}
{"text":"Quality lunch buffet, good service, I left stuffed! I don't live in the area (more like a few hundred miles west) but I found frequent this place if I wasn't so far away. I am not a fan of the decor but oh well, the food is good!"}
{"text":"Perfect take out. Food tastes great. the mango chutney and all chicken dishes are to die for. Friendly people, great portions. Little oily sometimes tho."}
{"text":"This place is truly incredible. The only reason I would take a star away is for the price... But the food is so good you almost don't care. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk in, you'll be amazed"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, delicious food and a quiet comfortable environment. Best chicken masala I've had so far!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for more than a year now. These guys are awesome. The lunch buffet is great although the same thing gets repeated everyday. Dinner items are great. I don't have a good tolerance for spicy food but they ensure their food tastes great without making it spicy. Value for money. Good service. Healthy options include vegetarian food. Most of all, has a great staff."}
{"text":"The Best Indian Restaurant in Tempe. I am big time fan of Channa Masala and they are best in making that. 10 Start to Staff they are really Helpful. I forgot my mobile and the Staff guy found outside of Restaurant after 5 min and gave that. I am really thank full of that guy. It was great food there I will defiantly go again and again there."}
{"text":"You will probably have a hard time finding this place. But it is well worth turning on the GPS.  This little restaurant is one of many interesting-looking finds in the strip mall, and the first time I met my friends there we all got hopelessly lost looking for it. It's a quaint little place, with low-lighting and friendly waiters. The food is great and pretty reasonably-priced.   The first time I went here, we tried their combination platters (we were all on seperate checks) and they were both 1) delicious and 2) well worth the price. It's definitely a nice option for someone who likes to try a bunch of things but maybe is with people who aren't used to 'family style'!  The second time, I was with my family so we got a bunch of dishes.We tried the palak paneer (pretty good), lamb biryani (excellent), saag chicken (excellent), chicken mushroom (good), roti (okay), garlic naan (excellent), and poori (excellent.)  They brought us some complimentary papadum and some fritters (didn't know what these were) for dinner, which is always good, and very nice of them!  Definitely try their curries, and lamb biryani (by far my favorite) which came with its own little side dish of raita to help take down the spice. We kept things at \"medium\" level, but you can customize from mild-hot depending on your temperment.  The palak paneer was my least favorite, but that could have been because I ordered it mild (to mix it up a bit) and it didn't pop in flavor as well as the others.  Also, my sister and I loved the poori, which was a deep-fried wheat bread. It tasted like fry bread and was excellent for soaking up sauces.   Service was very attentive and it never took long for a chai or water refill.  All in all, great service and food and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Normally I would give this restaurant five stars.  We have been frequenting it for years (maybe decades, even) and enjoy the food and the general atmosphere.  Today the woman who has been there for a while, and the man who has been there even longer, were their usual welcoming selves, but the tall young man we've recently seen there surprised us with his carelessness.  When he cleared our dinner plates, he swooped them into the air and allowed our utensils to drop onto the table.  Later, when he brought our check, he just threw the folder down and walked away.  We had smiled at the falling utensils, but the check delivery made his attitude seem like more of a pattern.  His indifference isn't typical of our experience with the staff at this restaurant, and we hope he will improve his interactions with customers."}
{"text":"I initially passed the place up since it is nestled in a typical strip mall off next to a Kinko's just off Rural Road on E University.  I was meeting a friend for a quick, inexpensive and hopefully tasty pre-movie dinner at the Valley Art Theater on Mill.  The decor was what I would call, the \"basic, no frills cafeteria like set up\" that can be found in many Indian and Thai restaurants I have frequented.  Practical and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare. We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.  As expected, the meal was a great value of $20 with tip.  Not bad for two healthy meals.  When I am craving Indian and over near Mill, I will return to the Delhi Palace again. Namaste."}
{"text":"Everything was terrible. Right from the Vegetable Briyani to the Chicken Tikka Masala. No salt or Indian flavor in anything. The only dish which was hot was the pakora. Everything else in the buffet was COLD. Consider the nearby restaurants like Thai Rama and Flaming Kebob instead for a good meal."}
{"text":"Loved it! I have been here twice for the lunch buffet. Their food is delicious. The selection is great. The chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken were my favorites. I like that it's not too spicy like other Indian restaurants I've been too. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a tough critic and I love this restaurant. Outstanding food and service at a very reasonable price. Long live Dehli Palace!"}
{"text":"This place is a shame. Service is the worst I have ever seen. One waiter was very disrespectful once I asked if I can change the table. \"I just asked!\" I didn't push it or insist. He replied \"no need to change the table.\" There was plenty of empty tables. I told him my two year old was in the middle of the way and people were pumping on him even when it is not even crowded. Then, I noticed him throwing the cups on a table next to me in hurry manner and staring at us. I don't want to come to a conclusion that this is an act of racism or fatigue but even when I told the cashier about him she said sorry and asked for the money of the buffet, though I didn't finish my half-filled plate. Worst place ever."}
{"text":"The lackluster service began when I walked in the door. I was unenthusiastically shown to the end of a number of community tables near the kitchen entrance, which I unknowingly accepted. The few tables on the outskirts were taken, so, I got up to select from an average offering of items at the lunch buffet, still excited for the new experience. Sitting back down with my recent selections and preparing to attempt to enjoy lunch my (unbeknownst to me) arch nemesis entered the dining room an older Indian? Woman in a lovely golden dress, whom my server greeted with a bow, arrived. I thought 'how nice a person with an ownership or familial interest in the restaurant is here...' little did I know. I attempted to enjoy my mediocre selection from the buffet  when I was jostled (almost knocked from my chair by above mentioned lady with a large pan of silverware.) Working in a restaurant, were I to bump into, let alone almost dislodge a patron from their seat I would offer an apology... Yet nothing was said. Suddenly a cacophony erupts from behind me as the lady in gold begins polishing silverware with gusto picking up forks and knives from one metal bin, wiping them with a napkin only to THROW them into another metal bin at maximum velocity at 12:15 during the Friday lunch 'rush' maybe 15-20% occupancy I requested to be moved from sitting 3 feet from an audition for a heavy (literal) metal band to a table far away. I was still well within earshot more so as a second individual began to compete for the loudest silverware polishing championship. I was cut off by an employee rushing to the kitchen as I attempted to return to the buffet, never offered a beverage and as Naan was tossed on my table the manager could not be bothered to even meet my eye, let alone smile. I predict that the recent influx of new restaurants in this complex will slowly strangle this thoroughly unimpressive culinary disaster to death, even as they wonder why they are failing and eventually close.   Three options for success exist 1. burn the \"restaurant\" and collect the insurance. 2. Funnel money for organized crime. 3. advertise to future restauranteurs 'how not to run a restaurant' and show how to succeed by doing the opposite of this miserable excuse for a dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Indian food because the flavors are really strong and it's saucy so the whole dish tastes like a one glop wonder.  I do enjoy Indian buffets though because you can try a little bit of everything. Delhi palace has a good buffet with a wide variety of dishes and quick turnover so it's generally always fresh. They also bring fresh garlic naan to your table, probably my favorite part of Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is just perfect. I tried this place on Saturday based on the reviews and I am very surprised the combination of the menu set is very balancing. I think this is the first Indian place I saw fish tikka on the buffet .   I would recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Long story short, check your receipt and get an itemized copy if you can.  Something strange has happened in the last few months, the prices have all increased 2-3$ each and it's not reflected on the menu. My aunt picked up our order and the man at the register told her it was going to be $92. For 5 entrees, 3 rice and 3 orders of plain naan. When she asked for a receipt he said something along the lines of \"Ok, ok, 85 then.\", but refused to give her an itemized receipt. I called when she got home and asked for an itemized receipt and he was very abrupt, bordering on rude. When I showed up he had an itemized ticket written out very neatly, not the original scribbly ticket that was waved at my aunt. I'm really disappointed. I'll wait a few months and go back and maybe things will be better/more consistent by then.  (Also we were given and charged for 4 orders of rice when I ordered only 3. Wouldn't be a big deal except the rice is 3.5$ each. And I only wanted 3.)"}
{"text":"Eaten here perhaps 3 or 4 times over many years. Each time I remember why I never made it a place to return to. This is for the lunch buffet only. The food on the buffet was too heavy. Too much butter(ghee) and cream based food Not enough vegan choices (actually perhaps only one or two vegan choices).  Even my partner that's not vegan didn't fancy the buffet food.  We both were surprised at how popular this place is."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner experience tonight this place has the best tasting vegetable soup its all vegetarian taste almost like manoodle with that touch of indian food spice I absolutely love it and it doesn't tast like ministrony. Add papadome crackers with your soup its completely free. The same with the salads they have the best dressing sauce. For only $4 they give you a huge salad! That filled me up quick maybe because I'm pregnant. I did order a chicken tandoori  I didn't know what it would look like and I wasn't up to having anything spicy or with their famous red sauces because  my appetite has been wack lately with this baby. They brought the Chicken and my stomach turned the waitress and waiter was so polite and understanding they took the chicken away and didn't even charge us! My fiance and son ordered a big feast of food.  So at the end they even gave us 15% off our bill it was so nice I felt bad about the Chicken so in return gave them a big tip. Honestly I can go here every single day to eat their soup, salad and papadome I'm definitely going to be stopping by here more often because its perfect for me and my appetite."}
{"text":"I promised myself I would not write this review.  But, I couldn't even keep this promise to myself.  My eating partner told me I owed the world this review considering that money is tight and people need to know what they are getting or not getting for their money. The staff was friendly upon our arrival and we were seated expeditiously.  Not too crowded for a Saturday night, hmmmmm.    My eating partner wanted to sit next to me instead of facing me so he began to move the placemat & silverware to the other side.  The waiter trying to be helpful, put all five of his fingers, on what was destined to be my plate, and swished the plate next to the other plate.  Helpful, but I was somewhat concerned about where those five fingers had been last.  i was soooo self disciplined that  didn't say a word, but I did use antibacterial hand cleaner on my plate.  With mersa and other types of infections abounding, I didn't want to take a chance.   Papdum came with coriander chutney.  Crispy and plentiful. The chicken biryani served to us had a strange color.  Very very red, as if cooked with tomato paste. Spicy as we asked but with no flavor.  Just heat.  We like the heat but the food has to be tasty.  (I thought of the delicious biryani that we could have had had we driven to our old stand-by that was further away from our house.)  What a difference a couple of miles makes.  Then the Chicken Vindaloo that was ordered spicy, was delivered spicy but with no flavor.  Indian spices were not strong enough; just chicken in a red sauce.  Even the tartness that vindaloo sauce requires was missing. Vindaloo is one of those sauces that contains a little bit of vinegar (just check any indian cookbook).  The tandoori roti was good as was the complementary yogurt sauce.    The people are nice enough but the food is probably one of the least favorite I have had in the valley (I was going to write worst, instead of least favorite but that would not be very nice).   Suffice it to say that my Saturday night dinner was less than tasty and certainly less than memorable.   Moral of the story:  Drive a few extra miles and go to a place where you know you will get excellent food at a fair price. It will be worth the drive. (Did you read this dear eating partner???)"}
{"text":"$13 for a chicken dish and the portion size was so small I was surprised. Im guessing the rent must be high because that was not worth the price. Go to a different place to get more for your money."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet price went up now over $10 after tax (not including drink, though tea is included in the buffet). Considering this price hike it's no longer a must-recommend. The buffet options have not increased to match the new price and there are cheaper lunch buffets near campus.   Now having said that the food here is still incredible. They still make the best chicken masala near campus and their naan and tandoori are still delicious."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to eat at while in Tempe (sadly, I don't go that often since graduating from ASU).  I've eaten here many, many, many times so that tells you I'm a fan. I go back for the same reasons - very well made, great tasting N Indian dishes such as the Keema Mutter (ground lamb), Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, and their Gulab Jamun and rice pudding is super tasty.  I know how to enjoy this place without pigging out (1st round of proteins, 2nd round of vegetables, skip the bread and rice, 2 gulab and I'm set!), though I do leave quite full but not regretting it.  Their service is good and I've never had any server issues.. nor food issues, for that matter.  They are consistent in flavorful N Indian food and service (I went 2 weeks ago and was impressed with the fact that nothing had changed!) so that's why I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I spend allot of time at the Tempe Improv so I go to the Delhi Palace for the lunch buffet which is located on the south side of the building across the street on University. The lunch buffet is open from 11:00 - 2:30 so if you like authentic northern Indian cuisine this is the real deal for $8.95 and the best part is you don't have to whip out the Sun Brand Tandoori Powder and make it yourself.  I normally do not like buffet food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for any length of time but if you arrive early at 11:00 when they first open there is a good chance your buffet food experience will be a good one. I believe the food on the lunch buffet is not spicy on purpose to appeal to the masses which would make since, I personally prefer my Indian food spicy with some burn and I'm sure if you order something off the regular menu they will kick it up a notch for you.  The Delhi Palace is home of the MASALA they have Chicken Tikka Masala, Garam Masala, Chana Masala, Chaat Masala, Tandoori Masala, and even Yogurt Masala. The only Masala missing off the menu is Penn Masala, the world's first Hindi a cappella singing group formed in 1996 by a group of students at the University of Pennsylvania. Deep down I must believe ASU is working on their first Hindi a cappella singing group but heck that's another story.  My personal favorites here are the Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Korma, Palak Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Garlic Naan bread if your into Indian beers you will like the fact they have Taj Mahal and Flying Horse Royal Lager beer, I normally drink the hot chai tea.  Repeat after me can you say green mint chutney."}
{"text":"Well, you expect some kind of hospitality when you are in a restaurant, making you feel at ease. Delhi Palace does not have it in them. In general, the servers sound rude and they don't look happy to serve you. As far as the food is concerned, it is not what you expect from an Indian restaurant. The curries were a bit bland and were very thin for an Indian curry, Naan was pretty good. All in all, that was the first time I went to Delhi Palace and it turned out to be the last one."}
{"text":"Great selection of indian food.   You can go off the menu or choose the lunch buffett.  It is not the spiciest of foods so if your party has a mild stomach it is perfect for them."}
{"text":"A must  try!  I am a fanatic about the lamb vindaloo, but they have a lunch buffet that will know your socks off. The staff is very attentive and the food is awesome. I know, what do I know? I am not  Indian. I have never visited Bombay. But I can tell you this place can make it however you want. Nearly every thing I have asked for they have produced. They have turned me onto things I would have never tried. Really great great great food."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have visited so far. Poor customer service. First we waited for our food for nearly 20 mins. After that we ordered for a second set of naan which never arrived. On top of that we were given the Cheque. Ridiculous place."}
{"text":"This place is a delight. I have been coming here since 2005 and its a hidden little gem in a strip mall on Rural and University next to the FedEx Office. The staff is friendly and always ask me how I'm doing and how work is going. The food is delicious. They do a great lunch buffet every weekday from 11am to 2:30pm - til 3pm on the weekends - and the variety keeps me coming back. The items on the vegetarian portion of the buffet change every day. Yes the buffet is divided by vegetarian and meat options, which make a good place to take those of the non meat persuasion. On any given day, you could try some great spicy vegetable biryani, some delicious lentils or dal, some creamy and savory palak. Or it could be vegetable korma, aloo ghobi, bombay potaties, aloo eggplant, vegetables, pakoras, salad and more.  The meat portions of the buffet always includes the best chicken tikka masala in the Valley (even better at dinner!), yummy tandoori chicken, and a selection of curries, from goat to chicken and lamb vindaloo.  At dinner, the menu is more family style, where you get a large portion of the item and and you can order naan or rice on the side. The menu is more expansive at dinner, includes items like chicken biryani, which is delighful and many more curries and types of aloo. There's a few times Ive made extra rice at home and come just to pick up some tikka to take home and got comped the rice. At lunch, they give you endless naan as well.  Ambiance wise, they recently redid the interior with murals depicting India and its very inviting.  Bottom line, great staff, lovely decor and ambiance. Delicious food at dinner and lunch make this place well worth checking out."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this based on the  Chicken Tikka Masala.  I haven't ordered anything else on the menu and I really don't think I need to.  This dish is fantastic!  I have been to this place multiple times and if this is an accurate description of Indian food than I am a fan!"}
{"text":"AVOID!! Extremely rude employees and average food. We have been to quite a few Indian Restaurants in Phoenix, Tempe and surrounding towns and this is by far the worst. We arrived long before they were closing for lunch and was hurried to order our food and then hurried to leave. When our food arrived they brought us a madras curry instead of chicken curry and tried to force us to have it anyway and said the kitchen was closed. We explained that wasn't what we ordered and had to ask many times for them to redo it. They also forgot to bring out our rice, when we asked for it they came back with a cold rice, I'm assuming was from a buffet. This is the worst service I have ever received, they do not know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"The food is great, however they say they offer 15% off asu students... We brought out IDs and the server replied that he had already applied the discount. I'm a math major and did all the math... No discount.   We had:  Vegetable fritters Chicken korma Chicken tikka masala And 2 sides of rice We were charged $33.60!! (I hope you read this management)  So, not only did we not get the discount, the waiter lied to our faces about getting it as well! Totally unacceptable. Will not be coming here ever again if he thinks all ASU students are this dumb.  We also just called in not five minutes after leaving to inform them of the miscalculation, and I was told \"oh, sorry, you will get it next time!\". Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I find myself wanting to come here multiple times a week. The service and food are both excellent. I love coming here for the lunch buffet, but the dinner options are also great.   My favorite things here are chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and then gulab jamun for dessert.  Tip: It is not that spicy compared to other Indian food I've had, so order it extra spicy if you want it hot at all."}
{"text":"Best indian food in Phoenix, hands down. Get the sag lamb and beef or chicken korma. The waiter always remembers us and offered is free samosas. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I review nothing NOTHING I tell you.  I am not that self-important.  Unless that is, somewhere is so good that it becomes more important to spread the word than to revel in privacy.  This restaurant made me break my own rules.  The food is incredible.  Truthfully, it is on par with Gaylord in Chicago, and if you know Indian cuisine, you know what that means.  Reminiscent of some of the great comfort fare on Devon even, again Chicago, the decor is authentic and welcoming, the food is rich and inviting and the service is warm and friendly.    It starts with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  This dish inspires more arguments than elephant vs, donkey, because there is no wrong or right way.  It is up to the individual chef's interpretation.  In the southern regions of India, you will find more of a tomato base with peppers.  Not wrong but..not what I love.  If you love that rich, spicy, flavorful, creamy dish so many do, it is HERE.  You know the color, bright orange, with just that perfect amount of cream.  The underlying sweetness is a perfect counterbalance to the desired heat and the mix of the Dhaba (cardamon, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, (and ahem, well don't expect the secrets to be revealed) mingle harmoniously allowing each layer of flavor to be experienced in one bite after another.  Of course, Tikka Masala to Indians can be considered to be what burritos are to Mexicans, a retrofitted dish suited to the tastes of the locals, but the tandoori platter and spinach (saag paneer) are a revelation.  In fact literally everything presented to us was perfection, from the papadum to the naan, and finishing with the rice pudding, the meal was one for the ages, and the price is such that you cock your head and wonder if someone managed to feed people in 2018 in a building they were running in 1998.  The value is second to none, and most importantly..  This is a CHEF owned CHEF managed place.  This means the quality is consistent, the atmosphere is unique and reliable and the respect is constant.  Don't worry about where Presidents or Senators may have eaten Indian food in Tempe-  Go here and be treated like a President in Tempe.  Twitter account not required."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is really good.  The best pakora I've ever eaten! Delicious tikka masala chicken and saag. They have a nice staff too.  They came around to top off with fresh naan every 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Buffet is good! Not the Belagio but good for Indian in Tempe. The staff try for the most part but unintentionally fall short on many things. Nothing major just not up to par. So worth it though! Come for the buffet and get the Chicken Tiki masala with rice and garlic \"nan\" soooo amazing"}
{"text":"Second time at this south Indian vegetarian? cuisine. Both times I was here for their lunch buffet. They known for their dosas - giant crepes filled with potatoes. The dosas are included with the buffet but you have to order it from the server. I suggest trying it with their tomato or mint chutney (sauce that can be found buffet). I also really like their chai tea and their mango dessert. I was hoping they had mango lassi as part of the buffet. Really, it fills people up so they won't eat as much?"}
{"text":"I had the Pa-lak Paneer and it was alright. It didnt have much flavor to it but I did get filled with the portion and it was spicy. If I was basing this review on my dish alone I would probably rate this place 3 stars but my girl absolutely loved their salad, vegetable soup and papadum. She says she wants to come here everyday from now on. I want to come back during their buffet hours to see if I might like this spot more. The dinner prices are sort of high even with the 15 percent discount we were given cause we almost left with just a menu but the discount kept us there. I don't like how the rice is sold separately. My dish without the rice was about 13 bucks and the rice was another $3. Thats pretty pricey for a dish that didn't taste that great. I like how the papadum is free and is already ready to go next to the sauces. We will be coming back. I'm sure I'll like it more next time."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner before going across the street to Tempe Improv.  They seated us right away, promptly brought waters, took our orders and delivered food quickly.  We had no problem making our show.  The service was friendly and fast.  The food was very good.  I ordered one of their complete dinners and was able to try a little of everything.  It was plenty of food.  I shared with everyone in my group. The other 3 in my party each ordered a single entree and we all shared some rice and naan.  The tea was delicious and the beers were cold.  The price was also very reasonable.  I plan to come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Went to dinner today July 31st and it will be my last time here. Found 3 hairs on our chicken briyani and still had half of plate o food left which I didn't want to finish it no more because I wonder how many more hairs I was going to find. I will post this on the news page also. This is not acceptable. The wait staff told me they don't use hair nets at all. This is unacceptable and disgusting. Just uploaded a picture! Worst dinner ever. Is not hard to wear head nets.."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, well prepared food. I can't speak to the authenticity of what they offer, but it seems good to me! Dining in, they offer polite table service. They seem to do a lot of take-out business as well, and have a buffet at lunchtime. One note; if you order through Yelp (or perhaps other online ordering site), they seem unclear about whether they received your order. I witnessed this repeatedly while waiting for mine (a little bit longer than it should have been). Just go with appropriate expectations. They're nice guys, and the food is good."}
{"text":"The first place I ever had Indian food and still my favorite! The portions are pretty big so we always have great left overs the next day!"}
{"text":"Excellent and Authentic Indian Food  !!  Prices are very reasonable around $8-15  I tried the tandoori chicken it was great and it comes with  lemon to add on top. Naan bread is fresh and only $2.  Veggie curry has lots of flavor. Everything comes to your  table piping hot."}
{"text":"Good food :) Have been there for lunch buffet as well as dinners. Dinner items are comparatively more delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. I dream of the tikka masala. The lunch buffet is always stocked and hot and fresh. If you like indian food or you want to be adventurous and try something new and delicious you must come here for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great Indian restaurant in the area for some time now, and I think I may have found it with Delhi Palace. We called in for take-out, and I thought the food was delicious! I was impressed with the interior look of the restaurant. It's spacious, clean, and looks like a nice place to sit down and eat at.  My only complaint was that I wished that I had ordered more food. I'll be in next time for their lunch time buffet, and that will solve the problem! It seems that this spot has better prices and portions when you eat in instead of take out, and the curry and naan is DEFINITELY worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I just really crave Indian food. Is there anything better than a curry dish? My god.   Delhi Palace is nothing to look at from the outside, and even inside it was pretty empty. Aside from one Indian family and this incredibly attractive, worldly-looking older man with shoulder length silver hair, I was the only one in there.   As I waited on my order, everyone was so attentive and nice, but I was too distracted by this rugged stranger. I thought to myself, I should see if he wants to date my mom. Is that weird?   Oh, excuse me, sir, are you single? Here's a picture of my mom ... hot, right? Maybe next time you eat Indian food you don't have to do it alone?   Instead, I stared awkwardly and left once my food arrived. Idiot. Although, totally worth it as the food was delicious.  Mr. Ruggedly Hot Older Dude, I was the lone blonde obviously trying not to look, but looking anyway. Do you want to be my new daddy?"}
{"text":"OK, its in a strip mall....but what isnt?  I absolutely love this place for Indian food. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. The madras chicken melts in your mouth! We seriously lapped up every bit of the gravy with our naan. This wasn't the only dish that was fantastic. Everything was very good. Definitely one of the best places for Indian food in the valley (east and west)."}
{"text":"Delhi Palace was really my first experience with Indian food, with its location near ASU and whatnot.  So, obviously, I liked Delhi Palace.  Until I tried other Indian places, that is.  I have since come to the realization that Delhi Palace is actually incredibly bland by Indian food standards.  They sometimes have a decent selection of dishes, but if you're looking for good flavor, drive up the road a couple miles to Taj Mahal."}
{"text":"I've come here 2 days in a row for lunch! The fact I came back speaks for itself. Tempe has many choices, but this is now my go to Indian place.   I've always been a bit wary of buffets worried about quality, but the food here tastes totally fresh. All the items were loaded with flavor. The 1 star reviews without much substance frustrate me, because I believe this deserves a 5 star rating.   They seem to have some different options daily. The Mango chutney with the vegetable fritters was amazing. The service was subdued and polite as I would expect in Indian culture. I believe there may be room for a bit more proactive engagement. I think many people are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, and that engagement could help those individuals feel more comfortable.   The decor is nice. There was definitely an effort made to give it a feel that I would call classy Indian.  Without hesitation I can say I will be back!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and it was phenomenal. It had the right amount of spice, sauce, chicken and potatoes. Although the portion for take-out was smaller than expected, it is very filling. You do have to order rice separately, which was not terrible for the price. They even gave me complimentary Naan bread! Overall, my stomach is happy on this Sunday. :)"}
{"text":"3.5--Took too long to completet the review but I believe my partner had the chicken vindaloo, we had various chutney's, and I ordered the Tandoori chicken. It thought everything was good. One of the chutneys was nice and spicy so my son, who is very particular, okay picky actually enjoyed it with a side of rice and chicken appetizer. Overall, the service was good and so was the food, would visit again..."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food with great service! I always love a good lamb vindaloo and I think theirs is the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet there today. On the plus side, they had a good variety of food for the buffet. The food in general was bland. It did not have much flavor. The spices did not come through in the food and the sauces for the curries were watery. The atmosphere inside was not bad. It is quiet and authentic. Overall, the palace passes for average."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Indian food around the world and this place is as authentic/real/good as it gets. I don't quite grasp the bad reviews.  The service is consistently good (not great, but its not fine dining), the flavors are excellent, and the prices are pretty good.  I recommend ordering one of the dinners or going family style.  The range of flavors amongst their various dishes is impressive and you don't get the full flavor experience unless you do."}
{"text":"I love this place for Indian cuisine! The lunch buffet is full of different choices including goat! I pass on the goat and indulge on the chicken tikka masala and keema. And, I love the mint chutney with the fried delicious vegetables. At least, I think they are vegetables. For dessert, I have the kheer, mango pudding and carrot cake. The service is always great too; constant water refills and naan. It's delicious! My only regret is every time I go... I overeat and am stuffed like a turkey. Waddling my way back to work. I'm basically worthless for the rest of the day... wanting to take a nap underneath my desk."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been here 3 or 4 times and always order something different.  Everything has been so good.  They always give good/fast service.  Very authentic Indian food... similar to food I ate while traveling in India, just less spice.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Indian Restaurant maybe 10 - 15 years ago.  Then I found better places.  Most recent favorite is Nandini.  Hadn't been in a long long time but got a groupon and was excited to try it again.   We went for lunch which is a buffet.  My youngest daughter has two broken bones in her foot and is walking with crutches.  We were seated almost as far from the buffet as you can get.  Were served water that was half full with no ice.  The buffet is half chicken dishes (I don't eat chicken) and half vegetarian.  The vegetarian food was okay flavor but all but one dish was to spicy to eat without yogurt sauce for us.  Nothing stood out.  The garlic naan was pretty good.  The rice pudding was pretty good.  Bill for 2 adults and 1 child was $28.    Service was pretty bad and unfriendly.  I can't imagine coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Delhi palace quite a few times now and am always concerned with the consistency of the place.From my most recent experience, I had a take home from Delhi palace last week (paneer masala.. a vegetarian dish) and it was awesome... With expectations soaring high, I went there to have lunch buffet yesterday and it was by far the worst Indian food I've ever had in tempe..All the Indian restaurants in tempe rip you off for sure..but they can try to at least provide good food for the money they take.. stale would be an under statement to describe the state of food there yesterday..The same paneer masala that i was praising about was there in the menu and i was a happy soul until i took the first bite of roti with that curry..It was awfull!!!!!!!!!!!!!...none of the dishes in the lunch buffet were atleast near the average mark..The deserts they ha only added to the misery of the lunch.... I am just praying for a 'Consistent Tasty Indian Restaurant near ASU'"}
{"text":"If you had asked me about this place a few years ago I would have had a much higher rating. I used to dine in here a lot and it was always excellent. Recently though I have had some not so great experiences.   I keep coming back because of their Madrasi Chicken dish. Its the only place I can find it and it is delicious with its coconut curry tasting chicken, ahh, its so good with their rice. But everything else has seemed to decline in quality recently. I'm finding more of the chicken is dark meat and in strange pieces. I'm not a fan of dark meat and think it looks gross and cheap. Everything had become way more oily than I remember. My chicken sag just left so much oil on the plate I was really disappointed. Dishes are still tasty just not as amazing as I remember.   My biggest issue has been the service recently. The service used to be on it! They were clean professional, and everything was perfect. Last time I had to repeat my order 4 or 5 times over the phone until I thought they finally understood what I was saying. When I came to pick it up the order was wrong. When I asked them to correct it they seemed annoyed. It seemed like everyone was running around asking for dishes; they seemed rushed and unorganized. They did offer me the correct dish for free which made up for the mistake. Another time after the takeout order we were dining in. I pointed to my selection on the menu just to be crystal clear. I was still served the wrong dish. Having this happen two times in a row really put me off.   I feel like these kinds of things didn't used to happen a few years ago. The food was better quality and the service was outstanding. I cant say either of those two things about it now. I'm only coming back for their madrasi chicken for now. For my other Indian food nights, I am going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet around 2:30 . The food was all cold . Taste was just okay .  The only thing we got was the second round of naan."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST Indian lunch buffet that I have ever been to.  The quality of food, and the choices are amazing.  I also love that they are constantly walking around and giving you fresh Naan!"}
{"text":"We stop by here on a regular basis; not because they have the best indian cuisine in the valley, but because their service is considerably better than most other Indian food places that we have previously visited.  The lunch buffets, no matter which day we have gone, have always proven to have such a large variety. No surprises here. Just good Indian cuisine.  The prompt and attentive service is what really differentiates them from every other place we have visited. The wait staff never ceases to fill and refill our plates with a generous amount of naan bread. And the drinks are refilled promptly. Some could say that their continual visitation could be perceived as annoying and bothersome. But, in comparison to other places, there is a very distinct difference.  The food is decent, not stupendous, but good. The service is even better. And the prices are decent as well. They have to, since most of their weekday clientele are ASU students. They would not survive long if they priced themselves out of their primary market."}
{"text":"This place has one of best tasting food in phoenix area much better than many big Indian restaurants. I have a travel job so buy food from them every week 2-3 times (Travel from different city). Even the people in the restaurant are nice and welcoming. There paneer tikka masala and navratan korma a very good (I take to go food- No buffet food, so can't say about that) Good Job keep it up."}
{"text":"We've been to Delhi Palace three times now.  I prefer their dinner service to their lunch buffet. The lunch buffet has a decent number of options but I didn't care for the food too much. The saag or palak dish(not sure) was tasty but I found the baingan bharta to be too sweet for me. The rice was ok not overcooked.  For dinner I usually order the paneer tikka masala and garlic naan and this time we also ordered the chole. Both of which were tasty and hot. The naan was delicious and oddly enough, mixing the gravy from the chole and paneer tikka masala resulted in a delicious tasting curry. The chole does have ample raw onion in it, so if you don't like raw onion let the waiter know. I personally like it so it wasn't a problem. They offer a complimentary dessert of rice kheer(rice pudding) with a gulab jamun in it. I was a little skeptical as a I don't care for rice kheer but together with the gulab jamun it was pretty tasty and I ended up finishing it.  Overall I enjoyed the food, the owner was very polite and nice, as were the wait staff, our glasses were filled all the time and the owner came personally to each table to ask how the food was which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"This place was amazing although we were bummed to find that the buffet was just lunch. The food was amAzing and well priced the portions were totally legit and I loved every bite of my roasted cauliflower dish my friend ordered a less legit mushroom dish that was wrapped in naan type stuff like a giant mushroom panini (was really good as left overs with its three sauces 2 Of which ruled 1 or which was tasteless and odd . there wasn't na'an on the menu thou just other bread not called na'an . I would def think I should point out there's no pictures on the menu and the staff seemed to lack the English skills to convey what exactly each dish was if I was to ask so I just choose to guess turned out well for me not as hot for my buddy"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Tempe/Mesa area. Its the tastiest and has the best prices. The lunch buffet is the best too."}
{"text":"This place is the best. My wife and I always get the same. Taandori chicken garlic knaan basmati rice and mango juice and a mango lasi. Its cheap too plus udent discount"}
{"text":"Being originally from India, I find this place just perfect. Right blend of all spices and authentic Indian cooking method makes it a Hit!! Do try it out.   PS: Samosa, Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tandoori are a must."}
{"text":"I come here quite often either for the lunch buffet or for dinner take-out. The food is consistently good and the staff is always super nice. Plus they give an ASU discount."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better mix of service and food at any Indian food restaurant. The place is dark, cool, and the food is incredible.  Palak Paneer - good for your vegetarian friends Chicken Korma - sweet and savory flavors in a creamy yellow sauce Lamb Boti Kabab - the onions will melt in your mouth Chicken Tikka Masala - tomato base with a little kick Garlic Naan, I could go on and on...  Have the papadum and ask for the mango chutney as your appetizer. If you are so inclined, the veggie samosas are delicious with some of the tamarind sauce drizzled on top. Have some Indian Tea to drink, but save room for the Kheer for dessert.  They are also good for to-go orders and it's usually ready in minutes!"}
{"text":"The WORST Indian food in the area. First, we waited over 45 min for pickup. Then, when we got home, we realized our order was missing the rice. We made some of our own rice at home and then started to eat. Even though we each got Paneer Masala our meals could not have been different. My husbands was so spicy you couldn't eat it and mine had ZERO spice. It tasted like canned tomato soup. So disappointed and will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"When rating Indian Cuisine, I tend to rate it based on a bowel-evacuation scale I developed years ago. For example, a normal movement would warrant little or no Indian-food respect, subsequently, no stars. On the other hand..  There's the Cleveland Trembler; a violent ass-quake followed by a shit-tsunami only a large (and very sick) farm animal is capable of. The Trembler gets a full five stars.  Well, where is Dehli in the whole scheme of things? So glad you asked. Dehli has never made the Trembler, but it IS darned close.  The baingan bharta prepared to spice level eleven will send yer IBS straight into overdrive. In fact, all their dishes prepared to eleven will pretty much fuck you up for a good day or so.  If I'm in the mood for Indian, I typically visit Delhi on Saturday night, this so I have an excuse to get out of Sunday Costco and all that other husband/father shit expected of me on my only day off.  Why? Because even a day off with the shits is better than a day off fixing stuff around the house, shopping, or the all-too-familiar query:      \"Is that all you're going to do today?

{"text":"Get the palaak paneer.  Seriously.  I cannot emphasize this enough; I don't go anywhere else when I'm craving it.  If that were its only redeeming quality, I would still give the place 3 stars!  However, the rest of the food is also fantastic.  They're excellent at adjusting the temperature of the food for whatever suits your palate (which is great since I'm a weakling but my boyfriend likes things extra super spicy).    The garlic naan is awesome, and a staple of our visits in addition to the palaak paneer.  We usually order a lamb dish and a chicken dish along with the rice, and trust me there's leftovers each time.  The vegetable pakora is great, as well, and I've enjoyed several of their other vegetarian dishes from time to time.    I can't speak to the authenticity of the place, as I've never been to India, but I can speak to what tastes great, and this place is it!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, there isn't much to choose from in terms of Indian in Phoenix.  The prices are reasonable here, but it makes me yearn for good Indian food.  This just isn't that."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place.  Having a serious craving for Indian (after reading its review) I could think of nothing else.  I drove from mid-scottsdale to try this location out and I am glad I did.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did find that the selection was a bit small for the lunch buffet, but with the never-ending naan and basmati rice and the Indian tea I was blown away.  This place was my perfect fix for Indian.  I am planning on making this a usual haunt for lunch and dinner.  Also, the price was VERY reasonable.  $12 for all you can Indian was more than I could have asked for, especially given the prices at other restaurants.  Thank you so much Yelp for suggesting I go eat Indian today."}
{"text":"A bunch of us went here for lunch after church on Sunday and we were really happy.   The all you can eat buffet costs $10.90 per person and you have an array of options such as  Meat: Tandoori chicken Chicken tikka masala Chicken curry Goat curry  Vegetation Dhal Channa dhal Eggplant  Naan brought to the table Rice Salads 4 types of desserts Pakoras Chutneys Masala tea  This is not a complete list but more than enough to fill you up  Service was really good and the food was delicious.  The other good thing was the water served was good filtered water so we didn't have to waste our money on drinks.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I can't speak for the dinner since I went for the lunch buffet, but the food I had was good.  Not a lot of selection since it was a small buffet, but the chicken tikka masala was tasty.  The rice was done right too, which is a plus for me. I'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"Geez...   hiw irritating!! I do not usually order from ethnic foods.  My office was all in the mood for curry.  We put together an order and ordered delivery with GrubHub.  Food arrived and wow, for the money paid it was So NOT WORTH IT!!!!  the chicken curry 11.00 and did not come with rice or pita or anything!!  We called the restaurant back and asked about the ruce. They blew us off and stated \"it did not come with rice\" and they were not interested enough to continue the conversation. WHAT!!!!!!!! what about the customer?? If we are not valued, then our money and orders will go elsewhere!!!!"}
{"text":"lowest category of indian restaurant i would have visited in phoenix. Quality of soup is worst. It was thick gravy which we call kolumbu in India.Chilli panner was full of tomato sauce. Panner was hard.Roti was charred at the ends...i think they give 15 percent discount to student and hence the low quality. Try to avoid"}
{"text":"Perfectly spiced and prepared Indian fare without the extravagant prices! The best Indian food on this side of town! Perfect paneer tikka masala and rich and spicy vindaloo. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"If anything, come here for a decent buffet at a decent price. Coming here for dinner is like playing joining a pick-up dodgeball game. You're not going to have a good time.   Once, I accidentally smeared a bit of poop under my nose. How that happened is irrelevant. But I hadn't realized this, and spent the whole day with a scrunched up face feeling pissy. Anyway, that's how all the waiters here look. They just don't seem to care about customer service at all. Missing one of your orders of rice? Oh, no, see, you just didn't realize that the one cup of rice you have is actually TWO orders, just on one plate. Want more water? How about being flat out ignored? I suppose maybe they're just deaf."}
{"text":"Once inside, you'd never know that outside the windows (which due to relfective covering and decor sort of disappear)...lies an ugly strip mall in a non-descript transition neighborhood next to ASU.  That said, lamb vindaloo is a tasty treat and when you order it hot, it actually comes HOT (spice).    Place never seems to be busy when I'm there (mid-week) but servers are attentive and typically have given me a free naan or some other treat.    Go for the mango yogurt drink if you can't take the heat."}
{"text":"Great Lunch buffet... for some odd reason when I wake up hungover the only thing I want is plate after plate of Indian food. They have the usual assortment of curry dishes, vegetables, and bbq'd meats, as well as sauces for the naan. The best thing about this restaurant (bumping it to a 4 star instead of 3) is that: they refill my drinks when they're not even halfway down; and they bring around fresh, hot bread once when you sit down and again halfway through the meal. The price is normal for a lunch buffet, and everything else is what you would expect."}
{"text":"The most delicious Indian food in all of the valley. You must try this buffet....   Service is excellent also"}
{"text":"Delhi Palace is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix. Located very close to ASU, I used to come here all the time while I was in school. They have a great lunch buffet everyday, then they are closed for a couple of hours before re-opening for dinner. As expected, the quality of the lunch buffet is slightly lower than the dinner meals, because the food is made in giant batches rather than prepared on demand. It's still delicious, don't worry!  I love that they rotate their selection so you always get something different at lunch. The classics stay the same - chicken tikka masala, lamb, rice(s), vegetable fritters. They always have vegetarian dishes and some vegan options as well. Garlic naan is delivered to your table throughout your meal. The lunch buffet includes chai tea and dessert (rice pudding anyone?!).   I like to come here for dinner when I'm with a group of people, so we can order a variety of dishes and share. Service is always great and they'll remember you if you come here as often as I do! Try the lunch buffet, then bring your family here for dinner. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Okay before I start talking about food let me tell you that being an Indian student I have had the best and worst of Indian food and I was prepared for anything when I entered the restaurant. I was also a bit cautious regarding the service since my friends had a harrowing time with the management (A tale for another day). Once seated, the waiter-cum-floor manager impatiently prodded us for the order (5 times in a gap of 5 minutes). Irritated already, we hurried and went for Onion Pakoras for starters, few Rotis, Paneer Masala and Aloo Gobi for the main course.  The Decor was boring and dull with rolls of curtain carelessly hanging from the walls. Since Aesthetics hardly matter to me, I ignored it.  The food did not arrive for 25 minutes and neither did the pesky waiter. Looking around, we found all the waiters having a great time sharing anecdotes and sipping on a drink.  Finally after 30 minutes, the main course arrives without the starters being served. I could not imagine what excuse the management could give when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant!   The food was good, curry was done with medium spice just like we ordered. The naans were just about right although the mango lassi wasn't the best. Overall we were pleased with the food. Just when I was thinking that the place wasn't too bad, the waiter interrupts us, hands over the cheque and asks us to pay immediately since the cash register was \"closing\". I was *stunned* ! We had just started with our meal !!! Although I was furious, I politely replied that the payment will be done soon after we are done.  10 minutes after, the floor-manager takes time off from chatting with the staff and with all the \"courtesy\" asks us to pay up soon. That was it! We quickly gobbled the food, paid and left the place in disgust!   The food was worth 3 stars but I will never ever visit Delhi Palace again, not now, not ever! For a good Indian meal I would suggest visiting 'Chutneys' , 'Kabab Palace', or even drop by my house, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A pathetic dining experience. Was here for lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. The food was bland ordinary, felt stale and uninspired. The thing more pathetic thing was the service, the particular server, was snotty and arrogant. He was curt and had a irritated expression every time we asked for small things like, to clear the plate or refill the water ! Came out disappointed and angry. Needless to say I'm never coming back here! And some of friends have had similar experiences!!"}
{"text":"Been to this place probably about 5 times for dinner. I don't like buffet as much so I can't say much about it. You can order from the menu at lunch also, if you prefer that over the buffet. Their service is really good. The food is good also. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Massala and the Vegetable Korma, along with Naan. It's one of the best Indian food restaurants I've tried around the valley, probably the best out of 4 I've tried."}
{"text":"Free chai and bottomless naan with the lunch buffet!  This place was a go to for getting filled up on $10 when I was going to ASU, but as a vegetarian I always found its chickpea dishes left something to be desired.  Coming back as a reformed vegetarian and omnivore, I realized this place has some fantastic chicken.  The classic tikka masala and tandoori chicken are both good, with nice cuts without too many bones.  I also really liked the saag this time around.  Lentils were as good as any I had in Nepal, and not nearly as watery as they were there.  They've redecorated too and the paintings are brighter and more cheerful than they used to be."}
{"text":"The buffet was wonderful! Tons of selection to choose from and everything was very tasty. The price is very reasonable and the waiters and waitresses were very friendly.  The tikki masala was my favorite and the dessert variety was great! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Don't order tandoori chicken. Its cooked in catsup. Also, they give you bone in pieces vs. Boneless which is typical of this dish. Manager could not be wrong and did not offer a replacement dish."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service every time I'm here. Also reasonably priced. My favorites are the Korma and Tikka Masala chicken dishes and garlic naan. There's a lunchtime buffet too but I've never tried it."}
{"text":"Oh so very tasty. Don't let the exterior fool you. Yes, they are in a strip mall, but I am slowly learning that sometimes these deceptively blah buildings house fantastic treats. Well, that describes this place. The garlic naan is sooooo delicious. When my friends come down from the boonies in Northern AZ this is one of the places we always go to. The curry, lamb vindaloo, kebabs, chicken korma...I really could just keep going on and on! Everything is delicious. If you are in the Tempe area and are looking for some delicious Indian food, check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Had a great New Years Eve dinner here!  We met friends (one of whom did all of the ordering), or else I probably wouldn't have picked this place.  The service was great & all of the food I tried was great.  I especially recommend the okra dish - great flavors!  The rice pilaf and naans were also nice.  I recommend that you try this for a quick meal if you are in the area.  I likely won't make a trip back unless I'm in this neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place is a surprise...its in a tiny strip mall next to ASU. On one side is Kinkos..on the other is a titty bar..and the outside looks forbidding.  When you walk inside, its like another world - all the walls are painted, there is drapery hung around, it smells good. There is some sort of shrine in the doorway and a map of India.   The staff is helpful overall (had a few misses, but since I come here often, its been a good experience). The Naan is so damn good. The potato-spinach dish that i\"ve been calling 'saag' but is really something else is a dish I crave.   Be cautious of the spice ratings here..it varies but more than once i've asked for 'medium' and gotten 'omg-hot'.   Call ahead for take out :)  [Edit 9/1/07: I'm sorry to say that I had to drop the stars on this place. The past three times I've eaten there, the Naan has been obviously dry, somewhat stale. I'm certain that its the same naan that they had leftover from the lunch brunch meal.  They don't seem to have much business during the summer (like most az places) and seem to be resorting to cost saving measures. Either way, the naan has been sucky and that's affected my enjoyment of the meal. I'm going to stop going here. ]"}
{"text":"A little kindness goes a long way, boys.  This review is for the 3 star lunch buffet and the 1 star service.  I have to admit that I am out and out soured for most Indian buffets in that my fave one in DC, Ragaa, makes me weep how good it is.  But one of my fellow Yelp buddies said this place made her belly happy, so I gave it a try. The smells and sight of the sparkling dining room made me thing that good things were coming my way.  As I perused the buffet, I noticed that it was really geared towards quantity rather than quality.  Tandoori chicken was way overcooked (and all dark meat - not a big deal, but it seems like they are saving the white meat for something else - maybe dinner?) and the other meat dishes were just so-so.  Saag paneer was tasty, as was the daal, but both forgettable.  And the rice!  It wasn't fluffy and light like you'd expect, but a little crunchy - a sin at an Indian restaurant as far as I'm concerned!  The only true delight is the warm, hot naan that they bring by to sop up the sauce on your plate.  I could make a meal of just it, except that $10 is a little steep.  My true issue with the place is the sheer lack of kindness on the face of anyone that works there.  It's like they are pissed off that they have to serve you and want to be elsewhere.  Fine by me!  Go away and have someone else serve me that'll say \"You're welcome!\" when I say \"Thank you\" instead of scowling and walking away.  We actually got into an argument the first time I went there - we were a party of three, but a friend was coming so I asked for a table for four.  The friend never came, so we were surprised when they charged us for four buffets and then put up a fight when we asked to take the fourth charge off for a person that was never there.  Come on, man!  You served us bread and water our entire meal - you saw only the three of us.  Sad.  I have to admit, I do return to this place when friends suggest it for lunch - like a drunken hookup, I fall into it and then ask myself what I am doing once I am there.  I need to scope the valley for a new place and stop giving in to convenience of location."}
{"text":"This was a random hapenstance encounter as we were lightrailing Tempe.  We needed dinner.  The ethiopian place three doors down doesn't serve alcohol. Hey Indian food! Let's try that. Unfortunately, we left wholly unsatisfied.   I'm no Indian connesseur, but I like my food hot yet with some flavor.  This was more just pouring red pepper in my mouth. The decor was standard strip mall Indian - mirrors and murals.  The service was fine but the food was just meh. There's no reason to trek out here if you're craving good Indian food - unless your sole goal is to make you nose run and clear your sinuses."}
{"text":"Yes, I had been to Delhi palace the same day I wrote the review. It was around 9 p. And I think it would have been kind enough of the hotel staff to let us know about the ASU discount. But that's alright, if bare minimum courtesy is maintained, even that can work wonders."}
{"text":"To start with the one star is given only because I couldn't give anything less. I have been to this place twice (second was only out of desperation). The food is not bad I agree, but when it comes to customer service/ courtesy it couldn't get worse. The person who took the order was not interested nor patient. The moment we sat down he was hurrying us for the order, after asking for some time he returned within ten seconds flat and 20 seconds when requesting again for some more time. After all that he started pestering us to pay the bill even before we were half way through our meal. We said we would pay once we are done but he returned saying that he had to close some register. My comment seems harsh but the experience we had, the place deserves every bit."}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon this place the other evening and decided to try it out.  Since I moved to the Valley, I have been attempting to find a place that has food that doesn't make me miss my Mom's cooking so much.  Unfortunately, this wasn't anywhere near it.    Our service was fine- nothing friendly, he just got us what we needed when we needed it in a very abrupt, awkward way.  Our water glasses were left empty too many times for my liking.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala at a hot spiciness level.  The meal was alright.  There was no real flavor other than the hotness factor.  I was disappointed in this, naturally, as usually Indian dishes can offer both flavor and spice... not the case here.    I doubt I will ever return here, as the food really lacked the flavor that most people expect when enjoying Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Delhi Palace is my favorite Indian food restaurant... ever!  Do not be deterred by the exterior.  Just trust me on this one.  What awaits you inside will make you forget everything you have ever known and loved... you will want to sit there and eat until you can eat no more.  The buffet is a great value and the food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I have been going here since I was a young teenager and have always loved it.  But, the ultimate proof of their quality and authenticity came when I took my two friends who grew up in India and were visiting Phoenix for the weekend.  They thought it was excellent.  If you go to the buffet try everything.  If you go there for dinner, I highly recommend the Chicken Makhani.  Do not miss out on this gem."}
{"text":"This is our go to Indian spot... the staff know us, and they ask if we'd like the usual (paneer tikka masala for me and vegetable korma for the misses). I've always wanted to be a regular somewhere and this place does it right. The food is delicious and plentiful and the staff is friendly and attentive but not bothersome. The place seems pretty empty when we dine in, but don't let that deter you I assume they do a ton of take out orders as thats what we do 90% of the time."}
{"text":"The most amazing Indian cuisine that I've had. Their lunch buffet is filled with diversity and lush flavors. Easily something I can eat multiple times per week. The service of clearing your used plate is quick and the wait staff is attentive. I leave wondering when I can get back here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Review based solely on the Lunch Buffet.  This buffet definitely has some features not common in other buffets.  -Extensive dessert offerings -Chai Tea -Plenty of nan  What I like the most: -Variety in the vegetarian curries and a good kick -Lamb, Goat, and Tandoori Chicken in the non-veg section  Doesn't disappoint. I recommend the room with the buffet is and not going with more than 4 people. The larger room was dark and too loud."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Ordered take out and also dined in several times! Spice level can be adjusted by letting the waiter know beforehand. The paneer dishes are very tasty."}
{"text":"When I first came to PHX...yes this sounded indian to me. That was 3 years ago...Ever since I have had the chance to go with real indians (dot not feather) and try the real stuff. So last time I was here, invited by a friend...I found flavors just lame!   Want to dream this is indian food...go ahead! and keep pretending."}
{"text":"I love this place Great food, a diverse clientele, noisey families and fresh baked naan bread to dip in your sauces. We drive from Scottsdale to eat here!"}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends and we all had the lunch buffet. Thought it was pretty good, pretty solid selection for the price. I enjoyed the lamb very much-it was nice and tender and the chicken tikki masala was pretty good too. For dessert they have a pretty mean mango custard too :) can't comment on the authenticity of everything since I don't eat Indian food often. I would definitely go back again though!"}
{"text":"If I were to rate *only* the food then I would have given a 5-star rating since I find the food really good. But its not only the food that makes you come back or appreciate a place.  The service of this place is very poor. I believe the servers should be given some training on how to interact with guests, how to behave with them, how to serve them. But no, the owner doesn't care about it. It happens with me all the time, the servers \"hands-me\" the plates, bowls, curries, breads everytime without fail, insteading of keeping it on the table even when I am in the middle of my meal.   And the most irritating thing, they always ask you to pay while you are eating. ALWAYS! Why can't they wait for me to finish and then let me ask for the cheque or if it can't be avoided, why can't they be courteous while asking for it. Last time when I went there, the same thing happened and instead of complying, I complained, asked the server that I wanted to speak to the manager. This really spoils *the* experience for me.  I keep going back to this place since it is walking distance from my place, but after the last time, never going back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Delivery during lunch time: bland coffee, burnt naan, food was not spicy and did not come with rice, below average portions. Best item was the mixed pickle."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm an addict.... I am NEVER going to quit! My stomach is blind and loves all foods. Today, Indian! Delhi Palace is very good. I have enjoyed every dish. If you are a beginner I truly recommend a dish called Chicken Tikka Masala. It is a real starter dish and is a mainstay on almost every Indian menu. It is fragrant, creamy, rich and warming. It is not spicy. That's just a tip for newcomers. For foodies and ethnic eaters do try the Karahi Goat very hot. It is delicious. Vegetable Korma quells the heat a little. The Paneer here is some of the best I have tasted. Fresh, firm and creamy. Daler Mehndi the \"Punjab Pimp\" is humming beats in my head now. I must go , my food has arrived. Oh, I love when reps bring me free lunch.  Please, do not forget the Naan. I hope you enjoy."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in the valley.  It has been here as long as I can remember. since the dearly 90's I think.  Do yourself a favor skip the buffet and go for dinner.  Buffets do not hold the same quality as individual meals.  The benefit of a buffet would be to experience as much as the restaurant has to offer. If you do go, you must get the traditional Delhi dish Murgh Makhani (ButterChicken). This dish supposedly was invented in old Delhi and became famous at a restaurant there. It is a butter tomato masala sauce that takes time to make correctly. You seriously will not be disappointed.  I am salivating right now thinking about it. Get a couple orders of garlic naan.  Get some Indian tea, basically a chai tea with milk. Venture out of you comfort zone and try any of the dishes you see on menu.   On your way out the door stop for just a few fennel seeds to clear you pallet and ease digestion. I will continue to return to for the awesome food and the cheeky, tacky décor and bad lighting."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tikka!! We used to drive 20 minutes just to eat here."}
{"text":"Went there for the buffet and it was wonderful. Not the largest selection but they are exceptional at what they make. The naan and drink refills came regularly so the service was nice. Also, don't be deceived by the exterior of the restaurant as the inside is clean with nice decor."}
{"text":"You are better off eating at home   Disappointed with this place.  I wish we get a good Indian fine dinning place in SZ soon"}
{"text":"Well I'm an Indian so I might be a bit too finicky about indian food. I went in the afternoon and the buffet was okay. There were no special indian dishes just the regular stuff. This place actually reminded me of home cooked food. I didn't like the ambience but the staff was very generous."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for over eight years for a reason! Great food, great service, I just adore this restaurant. Excellent customer service but above all, GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet a while back. I didn't really have high expectations because a lot of Indian food in the US tends to be westernized. But I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot of variety - some great chicken and mutton(goat) dishes, along with a number of vegetarian options. The palak paneer and dal makhani were in particular very good. They brought freshly baked naan to the table too. The flavors? were authentic and not watered down. Taking out a star because I felt the deserts were pretty lackluster and could have done with more variety. But all in all - well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since I moved to the valley over 14 years ago & it's always amazing! Service & food are unlike any other in the country! I bring friends & family from all over to this place. Absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"For years this USED to be our favorite Indian restaurant and we monthly would get takeout. But it has been going downhill the past few years. The food taste and quality isn't what it used to be, and tonight the food was just plain disgusting. I ordered the Chicken Tikka and Basmati Pulao rice. The rice tasted off, like something in it was rancid. And the chicken Tikka was also very disappointing, almost inedible (and had a ton of sauce in it, almost like a masala, but a different flavor... it usually comes dry, not wet). I am so, so sad to lose what was once a favorite, quality restaurant. But this was our last visit."}
{"text":"Was pretty good. There was a lot of us and we odered a ton of stuff, family style. Some was better, some was worse, but overall it was all pretty good. Service was alright too. Plates were clean as were tables and such.  Pretty descent all in all.  \"I like\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Bleh. Not much flavor and pretty bland food. Buffet selection is pretty small from what I am used to at Indian restaurants but it's fine. All the food even the sweets tasted pretty much cooked out of a box and not fresh. The service is ok and the place looks nice. It's a one time visit for us because the quality does not match good Indian food and a bit over-priced"}
{"text":"Good tandoori chicken.  Skip the bland lamb curry.  Spinach curry was delicious; eat it with basmati rice.  Excellent samosas.  Heavenly gulab jamun.  The carrot squares were delicious, as well.  Wash it all down with chai.  $9 lunch buffet.  Can't wait to try again!"}
{"text":"WHOA!! What a cultural shock walking in from the totally common parking lot inside this shrine.  The smell instantly hits you and the taste buds start salivating.   I go at lunch time for the buffet and always walk out wishing I had worn elastic.  Everything is very good and it's fun mixing it all up.  The staff is quick with the nan and refills.  The 1st clue that this place rocks?  Loaded with Indians.  I also have to admit that I like entire meals without utensils.  Ya, I'm ready again"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is fantastic! I've suggested it to all of my colleagues and friends!"}
{"text":"This is one of the first places I tried Indian food in Phoenix.It's a nice restaurant with good ambience and great service.The manager and wait staff are friendly and they always throw in some Naan/bread with take out which is sweet.  The food however I would say is just average, some of the things I have tried are the chicken Biriyani (basmati rice cooked with chicken herbs and spices) served with raita (yogurt with onions,tomatoes and cucumber) $10.95 Keema Naan (bread stuffed with minced lamb) $3.95 Goat Curry (Goat cooked with herbs and spices) $10.95 Karahi Chicken (chicken cooked with bell peppers onions and freshly ground spices) $10.95 Tandoori Chicken (chicken marinated in yogurt cooked over charcoal) $9.95  They are located very close to the university and also offer discounts for ASU students.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the first Indian restaurant I ever went to.  That was probably 15 years ago, and I've been coming ever since.  I compare all other Indian restaurants to Delhi Palace, and none have beat it.  Their Chicken Tikka Masala is one of the best things I have ever eaten.  I also love their basmati paluo rice, mango lassi, and naan."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars  They have a decent selection for their lunch buffet. Great naan and tandoori chicken. Their tiki masala and goat were pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious curry. Great prices for the amount of food and hands down best Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Delhi Palace for years and  it is pretty decent north Indian food. Nothing to blow your doors off, but good enough. The lunch time buffet can be hit or miss, but when it is \"on\" it is oh so good. Tandoori chicken, tikka masala, palak paneer, garlic naan and pakoras are some of my favorites. They also serve a hot tea and I am not sure what it is called but it goes really well with the spicy food.  When I am not dining for lunch the mushroom bhajee or seafood tandooris are  my dishes of choice. Don't fool yourself into thinking the veggie options are going to be good for you. Most of their dishes are loaded in cream, ghee or paneer so diner beware, it is easy to pack in over 1,000 calories in a sitting.. Make sure to top it off with a flying horse lager. This beer is so good I usually order one to go!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Orlando, where I had an amazing Indian place I frequented.  Delhi Palace is now my new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant in the PHX area, so much that I don't miss Orlando.  I'll definitely be back even more times in the future to try more dishes.    The staff has always been quick and courteous, despite not always speaking English that well.  The food is the real draw.  It's fantastic!  My favorite is the Fish Masala.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We ordered the vegetable samosas, onion kulcha and tandori combination. The spinach paneer was amazing. Everything was cooked well and seasoned well.  Going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Roses are red; violets are blue. If you love Love, this buffet is for you.  The second you walk in, the vibes vibe vibaciously; piping swells of smells of spice splice your brain to your heart as painted murals? take you away to far-off and far-out lands of mouthwatering magic. It ensnares you. Anticipation builds and adrenaline fills your veins as you inch ever closer to the buffet. Then, you're there. Dish after dish, each offering delectable delights awaiting your bites. Chicken Tikka Masala?, Goat Curry, Cumin Rice, Chana Masala, Dal Makhani, my favorites. But the key, the absolute necessity to set you free, that would be the Chai. Subtle and soothing as your stomach is chewing each piece of your sweet feast.  Roses are red; violets are blue. If you love Love, this buffet is for you."}
{"text":"Awesome weekend lunch buffet. If the only thing you care about is good tasting Indian food this place is for you. From its looks this place may feel Meh, but they have very good collection of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for lunch (at least during weekends, not sure about weekdays though). Nearly all items were tasty and they were refilling everything on time. Buffet price per person was great as well. Don't forget to try their tea."}
{"text":"Oh wow--yes! You should go here!  Yogurt chicken abound! V good for options. V good naan. V fresh. V not dry.    There is butter tomato chicken (if you are in that kind of mood (hungry for butter tomato)). Rice very available. Spoons to get food from the buffet if you don't feel like using your hands. Up on their sneeze guard game. Hard. The latest models and whatnot. Also, only the dankest most relevant Indian pop music always spinning the latest hits. Hard to not dance while eating. Very nice people serving. Indian and whatnot."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying the food at this hidden Jem for the better part of 20 years, and it has quite deservedly earned a few best of phoenix awards over the years. Their mango shakes had me hooked."}
{"text":"I have been going here for YEARS. Their lunchtime buffet is awesome and VERY well priced. The a la carte / dinner menu is great too. Nice atmosphere, friendly efficient staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is meticulously planned with the customer experience in mind. From the murals on the wall to the staff and servers, every bit of the place made me feel cared for and entertained. The owner is also always present and willing to talk with you about your experience. The food is flavorful and consistently delicious and I've never had a bad meal here. This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix and I'm sure you'll love it too."}
{"text":"Everything was superb!  Try the Indian tea if you like chai.  It was very similar and delicious. Garlic naan was delicious and a staple with any meal.  Best part of the night was the waiter entertaining my baby."}
{"text":"Ordered via Grubhub for a late night snack.  Got a lamb & rice dish as well as some chicken tikka marsala.  The food was delivered on time and came in a Chinese food container (???) as well as a transparent round container, but wrapped thoroughly with plastic wrap.  Came with some yogurt sauce which I wasn't expecting - nice surprise.  Did notice that the rice was slightly under-cooked, so wasn't particularly pleased with that, but didn't ruin the dish too much.  The tikka marsala was really, really thin and didn't really have the consistency that I was expecting.  Had good flavor and spice as well as the cubed chicken did pairing well with it.  Had plenty of leftovers and fridge'd them.  Second go at it for a lunch the following day after heating up was actually better than when I initially at it.  It seemed like the tikka marsala thickened a bit with some refrigeration and after heating the rice and lamb up, it was slightly more cooked to how I was initially expecting it.   TLDR: Wasn't too bad, but unfortunately leftovers after a night to settle and a microwave to finish cooking rice made it better."}
{"text":"Four times. That's how many times I have tried their food. It's delicious - at least the Chicken Tikka Masala, Peas Palou and Naan.   The first time I ordered my food over the phone. I waited the requested timeframe and went to pick up my food. It took an additional 20 minutes sitting in the restaurant for my food to come out.   The second time I ordered I did it online. I waited an extra half hour before going to get my food. It was still not ready on arrival. We had to hang out in the parking lot for another 15-20 minutes.   The third time, yes I should have already learned my lesson but my brother and sister in law REALLY wanted Indian food and I did not want to drive all the way to Indian Delhi Palace on McDowell. So I relented and I ordered online again. I waited 30+ minutes before leaving. Surprise. My food was not ready. We waited who knows how long. When we got home they had not given me all of my food and I HAD TO DRIVE BACK to get the rest of my PREPAID ORDER!!! He thru in an extra Naan, $4.95. Great! That absolutely does NOT cover my gas, time, energy and missed time with family!!!  You would really think I would \"cut bait\" by now. But my brother wanted Indian food ONE MORE TIME before leaving and he enjoyed his Vegetable Korma SO MUCH that he requested I go back. EVEN THOUGH I had already said I would NEVER go back. But I love my brother so I gave them another chance.  I waited 35 minutes and went to pick up out food. When I walked in the gentleman calmly went behind the curtain and pulled my order off of the fax machine. They had not even STARTED IT!! 15-20 minutes he says. 20 minutes later I go in. No food. An hour after my original order time, no food. When it FINALLY comes out I ask if it's all there. \"Yes of course it is.\"  I checked. No, I was short 1 order of Vegetable Korma and Lam order of Garlic Naan. And they gave me Sag Lamb instead of Sag Chicken, and they would not exchange it.  Unbelievable!!! I cannot believe how SLOPPY they run their business. They clearly could care less about my business. That's fine, I won't come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Good food, flavors and pairings. Weekday visit during evening hours. Relaxed atmosphere and unhurried throughout our meal.  Can't say that much these days. Looking forward to return. Appreciate wait staff, and flexibility in seating our party."}
{"text":"My Indian coworker took me in for some Indian all-you-can-eat for lunch (~$9/person). Over-all a good meal - they offered three each of meat dishes and vegetarian entrees with a whole bunch of side options. Bottomless delicious naan and these fuckin amazing carrot bread dessert squares - almost drooled on my desk even thinking about those delicious orange fuckers."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here for both lunch and dinner and the food is solid enough here to warrant 4 stars.  Lunch is a typical buffet and the variety is generally quite good.  They also have, fairly regularly, goat curry as well, which most places don't.  It's on the bone, be careful, but the meat is tender and reminiscent of lamb.  The lunch buffet also has a few desserts (kheer!) and complimentary chai masala.  Also came here for dinner with large parties a couple times.  Service was great and the food is even better for dinner.  (No mass quantity cooking).  Our usual:  chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag paneer, daal, chicken curry, samosas, and loads of garlic naan.  The portions are generous and the food, all of it generally, is delicious.  The restaurant was kind enough on one occasion to offer us free gulab jamun after one big dinner, a very nice gesture.  But even without the freebies, this place still warrants a 4-star review.  The daal and chicken curry were the weakest dishes, the aloo gobi was somewhere in the middle, and the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer were excellent.  This dinner party was not so high up on lamb, but I've had their lamb vindaloo as well and it is spicy and excellent.  The interior is a tad dim.  Been that way ever since I've been going to this place."}
{"text":"Worst Indian restaurant of Phoenix valley... Curry was not properly cooked when we complained about it then they responded rudely.. Will not refer any one"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been excited to try this place.  The food was good, but the service was not great.  I had ordered the garlic naan bread and had been excited to eat it with my chicken tikka masala.  It did not come until after we were done with our food.  We had ordered it 40 minutes prior to the time it came out.    We ended up being charged twice for the bread even though it was 40 minutes late.  When we explained that there was an extra charge on our bill, nothing was done to fix the situation.  We ended up just paying double for the 40-minute late naan and heading out.    Nobody ever checked on us to see if we wanted more water and my boyfriend did not get any coffee or tea with his plate and this was supposed to have been included.  I am willing to try this again since we may have a different server since the food was okay."}
{"text":"Oh weeee, my friend and I ordered and shared the chicken spicy masala and a mild lamb vindaloo. Our good came in a timely manner and the restaurant was barely packed. That didn't mean the food wasn't good! It was delicious. We were served a really good appetiZer that I can't recall the name but it was made of mint and/or cilantro. It was free and it was oh soooo yummy. After a couple of minutes we received our order with garlic naan and basmati rice. I preferred the masala over the vindaloo but that's probably because it may have been more fatty and buttery.   I would come again. Thank you! For a good experience of Indian food in tempe. Yumm"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Had the Paneer Masala and the Malai Masala, with garlic naan and rice.  Heavenly! One of the best Indian restaurants in the Valley. We had the medium spice, which I'd rank at closet to a 7 on a 1-10 scale."}
{"text":"When this place was first recommended to me by friends, I wasn't sure what to expect as many Indian restaurants have disappointed me.  The food was outstanding as well as the masala chai tea and complimentary dessert.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it is a bit expensive as the rice, bread, and tea are all separate from your entree.  However, it is worth going back again and again.  Try the chicken korma, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place one day after hiking Camelback.  I have to give the place credit as they didn't turn us back when we arrived kind of well, dusty.    We always go on Sundays and eat from the buffet.  They have pretty good selections...mostly the standard stuff.  The reason for four stars is really the limited selection.  They do have a menu but we're too cheap to order from it when the buffet is sitting in front of us.  Okay, it's really me...I'm too cheap.  We also had a great waiter the first time who recommended an Indian beer that we hadn't heard of: Flying Horse Royal Lager beer.  YUM!!!  It goes with Indian food very well.  I think our tab is usually about $20 or $30, depending on how much we drink.  If you like Indian food and you're not fussy, go!    Cheers!"}
{"text":"When Taj Mahal closed/was sold my boyfriend and I were sorely disappointed that we lost our favorite Indian restaurant and lunch buffet. By chance we went here tonight and finally after a couple of months we can say we've found a new favorite! We are snobs when it comes to good Indian food and we were giving up on finding another good place to go to.  I am a korma girl and it was so tasty, their mild is pretty mild so if you can handle some spice go to medium, and my boyfriend's masala was surprisingly better then Taj Mahal's. A feat we though was impossible. The garlic naan was cooked/baked to perfection--- at other places we've tried its been burned or awkwardly gummy.  Even though we just had dinner there tonight we decided we're going back tomorrow for lunch to check out the $8.95 lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"great place for lunch buffet if you are a fan of India cuisines. You can get goats, chicken tikka, and chicken curry there. The only bad parts is the goats always ran out fast, and they filled it up very slow.... The good are their naan bread is amazing! Never had a naan taste like them ever. Also their cha tea is a must try too! Would definitely go back again. Hope they can fill goat faster..."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch buffet. Very clean place! There were a ton of options for the buffet menu. Service was friendly and fast, food was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but when you eat here, DO NOT leave any tips. The owner will keep that for him self and will not give a cent to that waitress"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place, but when you can't even say you're the best Indian buffet in all of Tempe...  Been there three times. Same items on the buffet each time. That would be OK if they were great, but the ground lamb dish doesn't have flavor, the chicken curry dish is filled with chopped up fatty dark meat, and the tandoori chicken is dry cooking under the heat lamp for long periods of time.  If somebody invites you here, no problem. It's not terrible. But if you want cheap Indian buffet in Tempe, you've got at least a couple other better options. And now that I think about it, it's 10 bucks with tax and drink, so hard to even call it cheap..."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Delhi Palace. Their food is delicious, flavorful, and authentic, the atmosphere is chill, the prices are super reasonable for the generous portions you receive, and our favorite server remembers our drink preferences as well as our preferred spice level for our dishes, which we love!   It's for these reasons that Delhi Palace is our favorite spot for Indian food. If you're on the fence about visiting, don't be! Go to Delhi Palace, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. I ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan. The garlic naan was delicious, however, the butter chicken had bones in the chicken. If the bones didn't come into the butter chicken, I would have given this restaurant a 5. The taste of the butter chicken was delicious and had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"I been to delhi palace. The service guys and manager have no sense of manners. When we are in middle of our lunch or dinner, he brings bill and waits there to pay. When serving water, they have no manners. They spill all over the table and don't even tell sorry or clean. This is the worst hotel i have seen here which has this bad service.  Food is not that great. It is ok."}
{"text":"Got introduced to Indian food here back in 1998. Have sicne become quite an afficianado on it.  The ownership has clearly changed hands here. Its run by mostly kids now and its not very authentic tasting Indian at all. The buffet is now one of the worst Indian Buffets in town.  If you want a quality indian food experience, try Kebab Palace, The Dhaba or India Gate."}
{"text":"As an Indian desperately missing his cuisine, this was the first Indian place i tried in tempe and boy was it wonderful! Completely satisfied my craving for Indian food and left a lovely aftertaste in my mouth. The bill came up to $45 between the six of us and thats extreme value for money. And the dishes were authentically indian. The decor is like from some 60's bollywood movie but nothing u cant get over and eat.Recommended"}
{"text":"After seeing countless movies that depicted Indian food as extremely spicy. I was very hesitant and scared to try Indian food for my first time. My sister insisted that I come along with her to this Indian restaurant- Delhi Palace, for their lunch buffet. I picked her up from work and off we went.   I went through the line of the buffet carefully picking my meal. I managed to grab myself some Lamb Curry, Basmati Rice and salad. I came back to my table and the waiter served us our drinks as well as some delicious naan. Delhi Palace toasts the naan as well as adds a garlic kick. The naan arrives to your table steamy hot! I finally dug in too my food and was so pleasantly surprised. After feeling like I could take on any type of Indian food, I went back to the buffet for seconds and tried more dishes. ALL of the dishes exceeded my expectations.   I definitely recommend going to the lunch buffet it is well worth the money! More bang for your buck!   The restaurant is also very conveniently located next to the ASU-Tempe campus. So if you're a student and you're looking for some delicious Indian food during a class break, you should check out this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time ever having Indian Food. I had always wanted to try it, but I never had the opportunity. Before I begin, let me just say that not all Indian food has curry in it, contrary to popular belief. That's like saying all Japanese eat sushi or RAW sushi, and that's also not entirely true.   Anyway, they start you off with papadum, which is a seasoned crispy tortilla that they serve with chutney. If you've never had chutney, the best way I can describe it is to think of it as a spicy pesto, with a subtle hint of mint. For the appetizer, we had samosas (you can get it with chicken or vegetables, we opted for the vegetables), basically an Indian egg roll. The dipping sauce they serve it with reminded me of funnel cake. So delicious! My entree was the chicken tikka masala. They give you a choice of spice-level of one to fifteen.  I opted for an eight, only because I've never had Indian food before (as I mentioned) and I didn't want it too hot for my first time nor did I want it bland. An eight was just right. And I'm amazed how rich their food is. I will definitely be going back!   Oh, if you're curious, my fiancé had bhindi masala, which was equally good. His dish had some curry in it, mine did not.  :) The people who work there are friendly, but don't expect to hold a conversation with most of them. They know enough English to ask for your order, if they can get you anything else, and that's about it. But they are very nice people. It's nice to go into a restaurant like this one and see other Indians eating AND working there. As I said, I will definitely go back!   I forgot about the dessert!! They give you this dish that has something that looks like a donut hole that's in rice pudding. It wasn't too sweet - it was just right for what was for dinner. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're definitely missing out! And don't be afraid of the spices. If you stick with the middle and work your way up (8 or more), you'll be fine. :)"}
{"text":"Best Buffet. Loved all the spicy foods. Best Indian restaurant around tempe."}
{"text":"Not being from the east valley I wasn't sure what we would find. I have a favorite up in north Phoenix and spent some time in San Fran enjoying a lot of the Indian food around Union Square and other areas.  So when someone suggested we come here to a buffet I was a little worried.  I don't care for Indian buffet's.  They are usually tasteless and bland.   We tried it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors and the spices where amazing for a buffet.  I would really like to come back and order off the menu when I have time."}
{"text":"While not my favorite indian buffet, this one was pretty good.  There was a fairly large and varied selection. I found everything I had to be tasty, just seeming to be flavored towards the bland end of mild. I also found all of the dishes to have a higher level of oiliness than i would have liked. There was not as much 'char' flavor on the tandoori chicken as I am used to. The garlic naan was not only delicious, but it comes straight to your table hot and they just keep bringing it, as long as you're eating it, no need to run out or even ask for more. Service was prompt and courteous, but it was too busy while I was there for them to be able to display anything beyond simply keeping things up with the rush, which they did nicely. The tables were a little cramped even when some of them were still empty, but as soon as the placed filled up, it was ridiculous. There were an unfortunate few whose table was placed so near the buffet that they were in the way of the line that formed. That lined was so much worse than it should have been, however someone long ago made the unfortunate decision to place the buffet line in a U shape. This makes it hard for more than 2-3 people to dish out food at the same time, and everyone else waits outside of the U for their turn. I thought the L shape of another buffet I go to was inconvenient, but I'm going to love it next time i go compared to this U buffet. Many things to enjoy here, including the value.  It's under ten bucks, and there seems to always be a $1 off coupon available somewhere."}
{"text":"Um...yes please! This is one of those cases where the idiom 'you can't judge a book by its cover' really applies. This place looks awful from the outside...like a place you would never want to go, BUT do not be fooled! I went here yesterday with my dad and brother for the lunch buffet and it was killer! There was a wide variety of dishes including chicken tikka masala (my fave dish), a spinach curry, a vegetarian meatball in curry, a stewed goat dish (which was Ah mazing), and even desserts and chai tea. They also come around and bring naan to your table. All for like 9$ per person! The food here I thought was really really good, and for the price you can't beat it. I've paid double or more to eat at some other Indian restaurants around tempe, and I can honestly say that this was just as good, if not better, than those places (plus the variety of a buffet is nice). I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since moving to Arizona. The location is easy to find and the outward appearance has great curb appeal. The architecture alone beckoned me to come. Once inside, the décor was magnificent. The two times I had went, the restaurant was empty. The first visit, I had their lunch buffet. I absolutely loved it. Before this I had never had Indian food. I couldn't tell you what I had other than there was green food, yellow and red. For the price, I felt it was a great deal. I think my favorite was their toasted flatbread brushed with butter and garnished with cilantro. My second time in I had brought a date. We had wonderful entrée's. The service was great, very attentive and kind. I love this place, and would gladly return, anytime. Indian is the new Chinese for me. Love, love, love. for this great establishment."}
{"text":"Nice lunch buffet... tasty, not spicy... not super extensive, but enough to be full for sure.  It looks like a dive from the outside, but try it!  Complimentary Naan which was REALLY good.   It's VERY dark inside... no natural light which was sort of a bummer for lunch.  Great service- they are very serious, but tend to customers well."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Delhi Palace many times, always hoping it would be better.  The buffet does offer many choices, and it's a great stop for lunch, if your standards for Indian food are fairly low.  I eat Indian food quite often at a variety of restaurants, so I have high standards.  The prices here for entres are about average (just under $10) for Indian.  The rice and naan must be ordered separately, which is also not uncommon.  The service certainly was prompt, and that is appreciated.  In fact, it seemed like we had two waiters last night, as two gentleman brought us food, refilled our drinks, and checked in on us.  The disappointment came from the quality of food.  It did not taste fresh.  The basmati rice was somewhat hard, which may mean it was overcooked or old.  The malai kofta that I ordered, usually a fool-proof dish, also tasted chewy and somewhat old.  One of my companions was very happy with her chicken curry.  The other companion was very disappointed with the yoghurt masala, which she said was devoid of any solid food and was much too spicy for \"mild\" as requested.  If you're near ASU, I suppose it will have to do, but there are many tastier options in the same plaza/strip mall.  I would not come back if I could avoid it."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout tikka masala and it was horrible. Mushy, short grain rice and dry chicken. On top of that it was $15! $15! I've never payed so much for an entree at an indian restaurant. There are many good indian restaurants in tempe and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for dinner, and the whole experience was just a notch above median. We picked this place through Yelp, and though we cook Indian food (I'm Indian) at least 3 days a week, sometimes we crave for restaurant Indian food. We ordered the mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the main course. The mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs (both seekh and tikkas of chicken, lamb and beef) laid on a THICK bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges. It arrived sizzling hot, and several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from!  I dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation, but it was a rude shock. The chicken was dry to the mouth. The seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices (mainly red pepper), and the quantity--so abysmal! The bed of onions probably weighed more in quantity than the meat. The tikkas were standard fare...oily and spicy gravy, with cubed pieces of chicken. The place is good for students, because it's so close to ASU, but otherwise, I don't think I will go back there again!"}
{"text":"Love! This. Palace! Beautiful interior with authentic Indian atmosphere and music. The food is outstanding. Their lunch buffet offers a plethora of vegetarian options. My favorite item was not displayed and so they offered to make it anyways. Complementary garlic naan is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Delhi Palace is hands down one of the best Indian places in Tempe. Only beaten by Royal Taj (which is truly wonderful and I suggest you try it).  The service is so-so. Half of the service men don't come by regularly but there is at least one guy who is super attentive and does pretty well about re-filling drinks and finding out if you are doing ok.  I've had many of the dishes there including their Chicken Tikka Masalla, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo. The garlic naan is fantastic. The best dish of what I tried was the Tikka Masalla. The vindaloo is off somehow, it used to be my favorite dish back in San Francisco but I haven't found an Indian place here in Tempe that does it right. However, their Masalla is amazing. That sauce with garlic naan is MMMMM.  The decor is very authentic, so is the smell of the restaurant. As with a lot of good Indian places it can get kind of cloying but if you are into the Indian culture and food you can easily get past it."}
{"text":"Best lunch buffet ever! They walk by and constantly drop-off fresh naan. How can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"I went here on a working lunch with some colleagues. We opted for the lunch buffet which had many great options. The price was good and the staff was on top of it. We will definitely come back. The only downside was it was a little loud with the music, but now we know to come and mingle instead of work! :)"}
{"text":"I literally eat here almost every single day.. I've lived and traveled all over the us and abroad and this hands down is my favorite Indian restaurant hands down. The restaurant is beautiful, staff is so pleasant, efficient and sweet and the food is out of this world!!! Service is super fast and food is very inexpensive for the serving size. If you're in the mood for Indian food.. Please try this! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go!  It's clean inside and the place is nicely decorated.  They have thick wine glasses for you to drink water out of and the place has low lighting to give that nicer relaxed feeling.  I love going here with my friends.   Sometimes we will go in big groups of 15 people, and they have never given us a problem for bringing such a big group.  My two favorite dishes are the tikki masala curry with chicken and the paneer (spinach curry) with a large order of garlic naan (garlic bread that is super delicious).    My real favorite treat is coming during their buffet hours. I only go on the weekends around 11, when the food is hot and fresh.  The cost is only $8.95 (since last time I've been) and you get to eat from a variety of popular dishes, including all my favorite: garlic naan, tikki masala, paneer, korma chicken, and more!  The buffet also comes with unlimited Indian Thai tea!  I just love their buffet for the quality and price!   One thing that is not in the buffet that is really good is the Mango Lassi, a yogurt drink!"}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall Indian place right behind Club Tattoo on ASU campus (Rural and University). There is a Vietnamese, a Thai, and an Ethiopian restaurant all in the same shopping center so my coworkers were joking it was like the League of Nations. We all went there one day for their lunch buffet and it was pretty tasty. They had a good selection of meat dishes (in addition to vegetarian) so that was a big plus for me. I do wish they would have had some spicy options since everything I ate was pretty mild. But the food did have a good flavor. They also had fresh made chai tea which was nice. And the price was good. I will probably go back again."}
{"text":"I had buffett yesterday in this restaurant, when I went to the bathroom, i noticed it was dirty and the kitchen next to it as well, and dark. I have food poisoning and feel awful, I called them and told them and they told me that \"The owner is out of town\", really?? I was told he was in town then out of town. Don't go there, I hope the City of Tempe send and inspector. 2 stars because the food is tasty. (no worth to get there and get sick though :("}
{"text":"The tandoori chicken was overcooked and dry. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too salty. They serve garlic naan and give you free chai tea so that was nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant . I eat Indian food wherever new city I travel too & I get disappointed because this is just too good. They listen to me when I tell them I want it hot hot. My favorite dishes: aloo matar & vegetable korma. It's perfect. If you've never tried a mango lassi drink- do it. Always great service whenever I come here I think they already know what I'm going to order now  . Get the beer if you like to drink"}
