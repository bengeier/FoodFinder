{"text":"We're sorry to see you go! You had the best Mexican in the area. I loved the tortilla soup. Hope you're just relocating ..."}
{"text":"El' Patron's sits directly on the corner as you turn into Walmart.  It's restaurant has me completely ADDICTED.  Service is wonderful, and they are super polite!  Now, on to the delicious food!  Everything is completely authentic.  I love the music, as it sets the atmosphere for a great Mexican experience.  Next they bring out the yummy salsa and chips!  I always try something different each time we go.  So far everything that I've tried have been TOP OF THE LINE, superb! They say not to ever go food shopping on a empty stomach...so stop past El' Patron's for a reasonably priced authentic Mexican dish before heading over to Walmart.  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I must admit the $1.99 Margaritas drew me, but the food was great. Authentic and reasonably priced.  

This is my new Mexican joint!!!

The fish tacos are great."}
{"text":"Tried the food... I won't be going back. The service was extremely slow. The window I sat next to had some crap on it so it didn't look very clean. The Crab Quesadilla was HORRIBLE!! It had the worse imitation crab meat on it. The chicken and shrimp was pretty tasty but the rice was super dry and lacked flavor. It was totally tasteless. Food came out hot however so that was a plus. After I we were done eating it took 10 minutes to get the check after we asked for it and then they never came to the table to pick it up so we simply walked and stood at the door. That got them moving. I tried and they failed."}
{"text":"Such a delicious meal very authentic and great service what could make it better ohh the margaritas!"}
{"text":"This place is great...............very friendly service ...........great endless salsa and chips.....Great drinks and the food is also very good......my wife and I always get the 2 for deals . It is never crowded but if you like Mexican food and you pass this place up shame on you"}
{"text":"Came here because they had a sign boasting $1.99 lime margaritas. We went in and ordered frozen margaritas. They were delicious, not overly sweet. We were only drinking, so I cannot comment on the food. 

I can comment on the great service. Our margaritas never went empty, either did the chips and salsa. The waiter asked us if we like spicy and he brought us out a second type of salsa. Both salsas were tasty! 

Drinks were yummy, service was awesome, I will definitely be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food! Very economical. Delicious margaritas! If you like authentic Mexican food, it's worth the trip
To north Versailles. Seems to be family owned and operated which makes it even better! Friendly service and festive Mexican music."}
