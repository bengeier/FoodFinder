{"text":"Nice spot, friendly staff and delicious food!!! 
Love coming here and enjoying delicious crapes.
Would recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Just went today for the first time.  The gentlemen that worked there tonight were so friendly and efficient.  The food was great.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 Banella crepes (banana and Nutella) for our after-dinner dessert. Service was slow due to only two staff members working; however, they were friendly. The crepes satisfied our desire for the French classic, but we were disappointed by the little amount of Nutella on them. The Nutella is squeezed on from a bottle rather than spread out, which means much less of the crepe is covered and there won't be much, if any, Nutella oozing out when you take or cut off a bite. At $6 for a Banella, there should be much more Nutella so that it's not just all dough, banana, and small hints of Nutella. Also, we would recommend serving the crepes to customers in a group immediately as they are ready rather than waiting to serve all crepes in an order at once when they are all finished - doing the latter resulted in my crepe being lukewarm and my friends being perfectly hot."}
{"text":"Amazing crêpes!
  Ordered 2 of the sweet and couldn't finish them.
A bit slow but great food takes time and they are worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel close to downtown Willoughby and were lucky to find this place for breakfast. Love the crepes! The owners were friendly and the patio in back was nice. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One time is all it took for me to fall in love! My friends are regulars here and they finally introduced me to this hidden gem last weekend. 

The owners could not be any more friendly, and they helped me pick when I was at a loss (because EVERYTHING sounded so good)! I settled on the Paris (it's a special that isn't on the website). It had mostly savory ingredients, like eggs, mushrooms, spinach and cheese, and a secret ingredient--pineapple! It sounded strange to me, but the combination was absolutely perfect!

The crepe was very filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Crepes in the City is a cozy little spot located in Downtown Willoughby right on the main strip. 

They offer a variety of breakfast and lunch/dinner foods including waffles, sweet or savory crepes and even ice cream.

The food: wow! The food here is absolutely excellent and never disappoints. I have tried several different types of crepes and have been stunned every single time. If there's a benchmark for how to cook a crepe, this place is it. The crepe itself is light and fluffy, with the right amount of crisp to it. The fillings are always plentiful but never overdone and the flavor combinations are genius. I give the food a 5 out of 5. 

The service: The couple that owns this place is so nice. Every time I come in I'm greeted with warm smiles and hellos. The lady even came over one time and chatted with me for a few minutes one time, which was pretty cool because I got to know her a bit. Definitely made me feel very welcome. They always make sure you have everything you need and have always brought everything to my table for me. I give the service a 5 out of 5.

The atmosphere: Very mom and pop shop feel, but very clean. The one complaint I have is the place is a LITTLE cramped, however they do have outdoor seating as well. For this I give the atmosphere a 4 out of 5.

All in all, if you live anywhere in this area, Crepes in the City is a MUST-TRY!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I heard about this great place from a friend. I'm glad we stopped in. What a great place! Super service and the crepes were fantastic! I had the BLT crepe and my daughter had the strawberries with nutella. Both of us were so happy with our choices. We had breakfast, but this is a great destination for lunch too."}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of crepes! Not to mention, the service is super friendly and fast! This could become my new, go to brunch spot... and dinner also.  Seriously, I just ate there for lunch today, and I'm considering going back to grab a crepe to go for dinner. 
All of the ingredients tasted fresh, and it was fun to watch them make the crepe right in front of me. I went \"savory\" this time around, but I can't wait to try a \"sweet\" crepe.
Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this crepe place. All 7 members of my family got different crepes and we were all happy and full!  We came from out of town and found this place online. We were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"The worst. There is nothing fresh or tasty about these crepes. I took one bite and threw it away. How do you actually put the word crepe in your name and put out such bland crepes. They told me they would bring it to me because, I think, they did not want me to see them \"making\" the crepe. Please review this item and develop something special instead of something so bland."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, large portions, good prices, friendly staff.   I stopped in about a month or so ago and have been back about 5 times now."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and a wonderful family who runs it!!  I've never once had a bad meal, much the opposite in fact!!  My wife and I get something different everytime and it's always delicious! The environment is lovely an welcoming!

Their back patio is small, but cozy.  Skip it on sunday mornings though.  You know those douche bags (and douche baggettes!) who were in downtown willoughby at 2am on saturday?  They're on the patio hungover, grumpy, and loud on sunday mornings!"}
{"text":"Excellent crepes. Great variety. Also ice cream and shakes. Add ice cream to dessert crepe for a special taste. Cute and quaint. Owners please your orders."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes made from scratch, friendly attentive service, freshly squeezed lemonade. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"A great place. We got the cheesecake and cherry crepe and the caramel apple crepe. Stunningly delicious! An OMG experience.  The crepes are large. You will leave with a satisfied smile on your face. We shall return!"}
{"text":"My first Crepe ever was at Crepes in the City a few weeks ago.  I'm more of a hearty breakfast guy but I decided to try something more traditional for my first go.  I had the Fruit Lovers and my girlfriend tried the Caramel Apple.  Both were absolutely delicious. The helpings larger than expected, and everything was so fresh.  I can't wait to go back and order something off of the savory menu!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here after finding it on yelp. Pretty good variety and on a nice main st. Light food and good road trip food."}
{"text":"Always delicious and staff is always friendly! Breakfast crepes and stuffed waffles are awesome! Portions are large and you will leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast!  Staff is very kind.  Flower lined patio out back is a nice touch to enjoy the crepes!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!!  The staff is so friendly and courteous. We had the stuffed waffle with bacon, egg and cheese & a tropical crepe.  Both were fantastic. They even have a small secluded patio in the back....definitely returning!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. When I work from home I have to walk over to Crepes for my lunch. The Tuscan chicken & Greek crepes are my absolute favorite. They are a stand alone meal with a respectable about of meat, veggies and savory homemade spiced olive oil. The ingredients are fresh and prepared on site. The service and atmosphere are friendly and fast. The back patio is a hidden summer secret! GO THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"Still here. Couldn't wait to rave. I've been here a few times since they've opened up here... this time was with out a doubt the best. They've hit their stride both with the food and the service. The first few visits were by no means disappointing only slightly lacking.   Espresso was delicious along with the BLT crepe. Glad to see these lovely people had a packed restaurant.."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  We had breakfast there, it was absolutely delicious.  I had the Aloha crepe plenty of filling and oozing with warm melted cheese.  The pineapple bits made the crepe a sweet and savory delight!  My husband was more than please with his order as well, stuffed waffle with bacon, egg and cheese.  The service was excellent, the owner was beyond helpful and informative when we were deciding what to order.  Enjoyed watching the crepes being made.  The only complaint that I have is that Crepes in the City is 6 hours from our home.   Definitely will stop again if we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"Such a great place! The Tuscan crepe is the best savory one, I've had a few sweet ones too and they are all delicious especially with a scoop of Hershey Ice-cream on top! Never had breakfast ones but can't wait to try those. Only complaint is it does take awhile if there is a line but it's understandable bc they are made to order right in front of you."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for take-out. I absolutely love it! I've tried several of the crêpes, and they all taste wonderful. Normally, I pick it up for my daughter and myself; we each get a dinner crêpe, and then we split a dessert crêpe. The place is well-decorated, and definitely gives that french vibe. There is rarely a line, and the wait for the crêpe isn't too bad. About 5-10 minutes. However, that wait just builds the anticipation for actually eating it which makes it taste that much better. 

This place is definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I stumbled upon them driving through DTW about three weeks ago.  My sister and I stopped and were blown away with how great these crepes were.  It is such a quaint, sweet little place.  It is owned and run by a husband and wife team.  It is very apparent that there is a lot of heart and soul that goes into this place.  They make homemade iced mochas which are so yummy!  And they have a great selection of crepes.  My personal favorite is the \"Chunky Monkey\" which has bananas, chocolate chips and peanut butter.  I have now been there three times and have enjoyed it immensely each time.  They even have a cute little patio out back.  A true DTW delight.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing crêpes. Wish I could eat them everyday. Get the chunky monkey. Although, the cheesecake and the banella are also awesome."}
{"text":"After spending the day in Kirtland visiting some historical sites, we checked Yelp for eating recommendations. Thank you Yelp for helping us discover another gem. The four of us enjoyed 2 banana split crepes and 2 fruit lover crepes with bottled water.  Not only was the presentation lovely and  the owner friendly, the crepes were delicious. As a side note, the bathroom was very clean and the place was accessible for my son's wheelchair. Chances are we will never come this way again since our home is in Utah, but we are happy to chalk up another great road trip food find."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night after a meal next door, looking for something sweet. I was thinking just one crepe for me and husband to split. However, the large menu and indecision meant I was getting two. I ordered the caramel apple and the s'mores. I was rung up and told it'll just be a minute. Well, watching the crepes being made is pretty cool. I've tried it at home and I'm terrible! However, my crepes were done in about 5 minutes. As soon as I got home, we enjoyed our desserts. The caramel apple was delicious! It was like apple pie with extra caramel. The s'mores was super good, but super rich. I couldn't finish it , but that's ok. I think next time we'll go for a light lunch or dinner and try the savory crepes. The decor is cute, and the seating area is small but adequate."}
{"text":"Amazing food. In time we are around the area, we always stop to eat. Absolutely delicious. Love this place"}
{"text":"Was passing through town and stopped by this wonderful creperie , staff were helpful and went out of their way to make me a crepe with lemon. Good price and very tasty crepes. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dessert! Downtown Willoughby would be incomplete without this adorable little crepe nook. Made fresh right in front of you, true authentic delicious crepes. A nice date spot, or a hangover cure.  I love this place! Not to mention, the incredibly polite staff!"}
{"text":"The breakfast Hawaiian crepe is so incredibly delicious and I can't stray from it BUT I always sample my friends and kids and we have yet to have anything less than delicious!!! Go enjoy this spot!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, but it was delicious! An excellent addition to downtown Willoughby! Great for kids and adults. The decor is nice and the place is very clean. Love that they added the back patio option as well. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time, had the breakfast crepe,egg & cheese excellent. The menu was very interesting. Looking forward to my next visit very soon..."}
{"text":"After a handful of visits, it is clear to us that this is a special addition to food in Cleveland. Crepes have come and gone in Cleveland. Many have been forgettable, a few memorable. Rank Crepes in the City with the latter.

We've tried the sweet and the savory in multiple variations and each has been excellent. Size is perfect for a meal and even a split dessert! Ingredients are fresh and any of the combinations are good. Pick the stuff you like. We really enjoy the Farmer and almost anything with Nutella. 

Try a bit of France right in downtown Willoughby!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little crepe joint.  As a crepe fan, I had seen it on maps and had it on my list of Things To Try for a long time.  Lots of great savory and sweet options.  Everything we've tried was excellent.  The 'BLT' crepes are mind blowing.  Will definitely be going back next time I'm anywhere near that side of town."}
{"text":"Tons of crepe selections and the stuffed waffle was absolutely delicious!! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in willoughby downtown. Can't believe I waited so long to have gone there. Tasty crepe and lovely decors. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We went in to grab a quick ice cream come for our daughter after we had dinner. For your info they use Hershey's ice cream. We loved it. Our toddler got her favorite ice cream superman !!!!! So they main reason this place gets five stars is not because of there ice cream which is a bonus but because of there axing Crepes. 
They have a variety of flavors that range from breakfast items to dinner Crepes. The smell when they cook one alone can give this place five stars. They also have Belgium waffles that are stuffed. We will be back tomorrow after the Willoughby hills 5k to taste the delicious Crepes. This is a great addition to downtown Willoughby. Definitely unique and will be spreading the word about this fine establishment !"}
{"text":"The crepes here are excellent! I tried the Tuscan crepe and finished with the s'mores crepe and really enjoyed both. The restaurant has a European feel inside. It's a really good place for a quick lunch date."}
{"text":"Had a philly crepe and a apple cheesecake crepe and we took them to go. We split each of the crepes and shared them and it was a perfect amount (as the crepes are of VERY good size). Delicious!!! Plus the owners are super friendly. I will definitely be going back. It's a gem of a place :)"}
{"text":"Crepes are great but the owner is usually rude. It's confusing if you are to pick up your food at the counter or have them bring it. They say refills but are very slow to refill. Coffee mugs instead of foam would be a nice touch. Same with the plates. I just wish the owner was more friendly, no warmth. Maybe I always catch her on a bad day. One day I walked there and it was closed when it said it was open. Crepes are good but little things need improvement. Get wifi. I would love to sit on the back patio with coffee and a crepe to get work accomplished but no wifi."}
{"text":"To simply put this, this place is amazing! Everything is made fresh here and super yummy! We stopped here on our way to New York and on our way home! Both times everyone was super nice, and the food was absolutely delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone, and I'm not even from Ohio!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend first came here with his two daughters (9 and 10)and they all kept telling me how amazing their crepes were and how awesome the menu is...I am a bit of a restaurant and food snob so I continued to think \"okay I'll be the judge\"! When I first walked in it felt positive and inviting and smelt delicious. The decor is super cute and I later found out from Diane (one of the owners who patiently and graciously helped me) that her and her daughter did all the decor. Which , I also found out Crepes in the City is owned and operated by Diane and her husband and their children, which I absolutely love! Okay...the food...was AMAZING AND SOOOO FLAVORFUL. IT CAME OUT FAST AND HOT AND WITH A WARM SMILE! The size of the crepes are great and filled with quality ingredients...especially for the price. Lastly, the restaurant was super clean and organized which I personally believe says a lot about any establishment. Ohhh, I had the \"Greek\" and the bf and his girls all had the \"farmer\" which they enjoyed so much their first visit they ordered it again. I tried it myself and honestly can say in my many restaurant visits , the lemon mustard made my top 10 favorite sauces...easily!!!! Needless to say we will happily drive the 40 minutes from CLE to come back:)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this restuarant. Gus and Diane the owners are friendly and make you feel at home. The Crepes are great and you will not find better crepes anywhere. I highly recommend this place if you are a crepe lover. They have a large selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Always delicious and consistent. The staff allows you time to enjoy your friends and food. The rushed feeling of other restaurants isn't present. They could expand the choices for drinks but overall an exemplary experience"}
{"text":"Quaint and friendly.  Interesting combinations of fillings for the homemade
Crepes.  We tried a Tuscan and a dessert fruit with custard.  They were both fantastic!  The staff was friendly and welcoming!  The patio in back was so relaxing.  I would love
To stop again."}
{"text":"We frequently travel to Ohio from Rochester, NY. We now arrange our trip so that we can eat at Crepes in the City as we pass by Willoughby. If we are short on time, we call ahead, swing off the interstate, pick up our delicious crepes, and continue on our way! The crepes are unmatched for flavor and we heartily recommend this place for food, atmosphere, and the friendly owners. The Tuscan Chicken crepe is our favorite savory, and you cannot beat the Strawberry-Nutella!"}
{"text":"I have not had crepes since i was much younger, my GiGi made them for me this stop was well worth the trip i had cream cheese and fresh strawberries my companion had chocolate filled Absolutely off the charts..."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes for breakfast, lunch/ dinner or dessert. The staff is super friendly and genuinely want you to have a great experience. The crepes are made to order so expect a few minute wait. They also have Hershey's ice cream, which is amazing!! There is also a cute little patio to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Not only are their dessert crepes amazing their Greek and Tuscan crepes are to die for!!! I wish they had one of these in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Friendly and family run, with a wide variety of delicious and HUGE Crepes for a reasonable price. Had a wonderful brunch there."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise, we came to visit family over the holidays and found this gem on yelp. Loved the savory farmers crepe!"}
{"text":"The most delicious crepes I ever had, I am glad there still doing great business. There is a assortment of different flavored crepes that is always relaxing with a cup of hot coffee."}
{"text":"Adorable, charming little eatery. I had the highly-recommended Chocolate Bacon crepe and it was delicious. Egg, cheese, bacon, strawberry and chocolate topped with syrup. A tasty combination of savory and sweet but not too heavy. They have endless combinations of delectable ingredients - you will have no trouble finding one that makes your mouth water. 

The staff was sweet and friendly and who doesn't want to hang out in Downtown Willoughby? Pick a seat by the window and people watch while enjoying this great place!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun little place to eat. I love the little porch area outside. The service is good and the crepes are amazing. We always take our out of friends to this little place and have never had a bad crepe."}
{"text":"I found Crepes In the City on Yelp and have had it bookmarked for the longest time. Honestly, now that I've come once, I could see myself driving out of my way to come back. This creperie is warm and inviting. Regardless of age, you'll adore it. Even better: if you need a party place, Crepes in the City is an excellent choice. As for the crepes themselves, they are o-u-t-s-t-a-n-d-i-n-g. Usually, I equate crepes as a little snacky treat. But these crepes are a tasty MEAL-- so huge, you'll need a fork and knife.

Loves:
+ The cute, Parisian brocade decor that adorns the walls.
+ Glitzy chandeliers and black accent furniture.
+ Spacious, shaded, exposed brick patio in the back (just go through the little door near the restroom).
+ Overall cozy seating and the neatest calligraphy menu i've ever seen in my life.
+ Delicious crepes. We tried the Tuscan Chicken savory crepe and the Fruit Lovers sweet crepe (blueberries, strawberries, banana, and custard). I highlight recommend both, or at least getting one sweet and one savory.
+ Cute selection of ice cream, milkshakes and malts. Real malts! My Mom was so pumped to find an old-fashioned, creamy malt.

Cons:
+ I wanted all the crepes????"}
{"text":"Fantastic tasting crepe.  I had the Greek crepe and the taste was A-1.  The place is small, but I have no issue with that.  It would be nice to have real plates and silverware.  This is the only real area for improvement!  Keep up the food quality.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"We stop here in our way to Niagara Falls.... We loved it! The crepes were delicious and the service was fantastic. 
We were so happy that we found this place!"}
{"text":"We got the fruit lovers custard crepe for dessert! I love custard anything!! They use fresh ingredients and make the crepes right in front of you!! It was a quick in and out. Next time I would like to try a savory crepe and have brunch here. Not only do they have sweet and savory crepes they also have waffles and Hershey's ice cream too! I recommend this place for brunch or even an after dinner dessert stop. The shop is adorable! I would say a French inspired decor."}
{"text":"Really good crepes, great courteous and friendly staff! 

A few things, this seems better suited for breakfast/dessert crepes.  The savory crepes are good, but the desert crepe is their main draw for sure! The sweet crepes are amazing! 

The other neat thing they do are the stuffed Belgian waffles.  This is a really unique item, but could benefit from a higher quality syrup. The syrup they use is the generic type of syrup. If they had high quality syrup it would take the waffles over the top. 

My recommendation, stick with the sweet crepes or the breakfast type crepes.  

Overall awesome place that I would definitely recommend for breakfast or dessert!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch this morning! The Western omelette is amazing and highly recommended. Small place with limited service but the great food definitely overrules the casual atmosphere!! Wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"We each had a breakfast crepe and split a dessert crepe. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh. They were very friendly. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wonderful sweet little cafe which is simply decorated in black & white with French accents. Pleasant staff at the ready to serve. You can watch the crepe whisperer take a 10\"-12\" crepe, generously fill it with a varied assortment of ingredients, and then fold it into a unique tasty triangle of yum. Nice secluded patio in the back. Unfortunately tables and seats were left wet from rain the evening before. We were there at 11am and there were no other customers so unless they had just finished with a rush of patrons since opening they had plenty of time to prep the patio. A staff member was sitting in a chair, on the phone, smoking and could have taken that time to wipe furniture off.

Aloha/Hawaiian crepe of ham, bacon, eggs, cheese, & pineapple was filling and delicious. Don't be put off by the pineapple. It's not overdone but rather a delicate contrast to the savory. Looking forward to a sweet crepe on next visit.

Inside tables and chairs were clean and ready for the next guests. Drapery, floor and walls appeared to be maintained though I didn't inspect all that closely. Bathroom was large & clean with everything in working order. 

Not real crazy about using plastic plates, flatware and styrofoam cups. I get it though as the place is tiny with no apparent back kitchen to house a dishwasher. Everything is done right out in the open. However, for me, coffee mugs would go a long way to kick the experience up a notch.

All said, I think I'll be a regular there and can't wait to introduce other friends to the place. The plastic serve ware and the wet patio experience are both minor infractions which haven't dampened my desire to go there again.... and soon!"}
{"text":"I had both a dessert and savory crepe... both were super delicious! One was full of eggs and vegetables and it was good. A LITTLE EXPENSIVE. But the dessert one was my favorite. I got a simple one, the honey one, and it was super delicious. I actually feel like the plain one would be very good too. This is such a cute little place and I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"There is nowhere around to eat crepes! The owners are some of the nicest people u will meet! The Crepes are amazing! Nice and cozy place to eat!"}
{"text":"Holy crepe!

We were randomly out on the east side, waiting for his car to be serviced. Our stomachs were growling for some breakfast, and off we went to search for food in Willoughby.

That's when we stopped here! It's cute inside- smaller crepe cafe trying for a Parisian type of feel. There was a young guy taking the meal orders and an older guy calming making the crepes in the back.

We ordered a Hawaiian crepe and a farmer crepe along with our coffee. Typical diner coffee. The crepes came out on paper plates, but man, they were gigantic!!!

Like really huge! The ingredients though we're very fresh, and the crepes were delicious- cooked thinly, not too oily, and flavorful. To us, it just tasted very fresh and good. My fave had to be the pineapple sauce that came with mine...! Mmm..

If you're in the area, definitely stop by for a crepe! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Not sure if you want breakfast, lunch or dessert- go here! You can have it all! I've only ever seen three people work there, I'm sorry I've never gotten their names, but they work hard and are very friendly and accommodating. When we brought our parents and Grandparents there, they came and took our order instead of counter service. My personal favorite is the creamy chicken crepe, but we have yet to find one we didn't like! My Son would argue that the waffles are the best - he usually orders 2. Please keep in mind, they are preparing by traditional means, so mass production can't and shouldn't happen here. So when you have a large party, they normally come out 2 or 3 at a time. So, relax enjoy the company and figure out what crepe you will order to take home!"}
{"text":"The farmer's crepe is delicious and perfect. It's very filling, but great for lunch. The lemon mustard is probably the best part, and the owners who work here are very nice and interesting to talk with."}
{"text":"Stopped off here based off of the Yelp reviews and let me just say that Yelp did not steer us wrong. I had the chicken carbonara crepe which was out of this world! I just ordered a chunky monkey crepe to go I loved it so much. The staff was extremely friendly as well. A great spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! It was so good we had to order more! We would definitely recommend this place. Delicious crepes and Belgium waffles."}
{"text":"The last time I had a crepe it was dainty, like snack sized, and it was a dessert, not a main course. So that's what I was expecting until I got here. I was happily surprised to discover that the actual crepes they make start out as a thin, round batter on a griddle about a foot in diameter, then the ingredients are added and the crepe is then folded over into a neat, hearty triangle of deliciousness!

The menu offerings are plentiful and it includes Belgian waffles, breakfast crepes, dessert crepes, and savory crepes. There was also a side menu that I wish I had seen before I ordered, but it was oddly placed on a wall behind us by the tables and not in obvious view. There were some really tasty options there, too. The menus were masterfully, neatly handwritten, and very easy to read.

I ordered a Western crepe with ham, green peppers, onion and cheese, and I asked for bacon to be added. My daughter ordered the Tropical Paradise crepe with pineapple, coconut, and custard.

After ordering and paying for our food, the crepes were made and brought to our table. The crepes were quite thick and filling! I was expecting to have to order a second one because I thought I'd be hungry after the first one. Glad I didn't! Wow! We were both stuffed and satisfied. We didn't eat again for several hours later.

Don't expect a super fancy and dainty decor. This place is simple and cozy. Our food was served on paper plates with plastic flatware, so definitely no frills there, but the food is the important part of the experience and it did not disappoint.

Our entire bill came to about $21, which included coffee for both of us. I will definitely be returning to sample more menu items!"}
{"text":"Went here a week after they opened, had the strawberry Nutella crepe that was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice patio out back. Would love to go back and try a Belgian waffle or one of the \"savory\" lunch crepes."}
{"text":"One of the best crepe places I've been to, anywhere! I had both a savory and a sweet crepe -- and both were amazing. The portions are huge so you can even split a crepe with a friend, but you'll want your own for dessert mmm! Would suggest this place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even just dessert.

Staff was also really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The service, atmosphere, and quality of food here is impeccable. If you're looking for a quick breakfast or lunch that will fill you up, I would highly suggest here!"}
{"text":"Great place. Super friendly staff, fast service, and the food was amazing. Crepes are huge and filled to the brim with goodness. Every bite is delectable. If you have a craving for something sweet I recommend the banana split crepe. Keep up the fantastic work guys!"}
{"text":"Three of us stopped for lunch on a Monday.  It was quiet inside, and our order was ready in five minutes.  We two Tuscan crepes and a Greek. They were plenty tasty and delicious,  priced at 8 dollars which is decent value.  I might have made this a five star review if they did not use plastic plates and silverware along with styrofoam cups.  I care about the environment and enjoy supporting businesses that do as well."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Was on my way to just grab a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee, but looked across the street and spotted Crepes In the City. Got a banana Nutella crepe and a waffle bacon egg and cheese sandwich. So good! Only thing was the environment is very casual, could improve with just some more ambiance; music, real silverware/plates/cups."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the Western breakfast crepe and my boyfriend had the Hawaiian. Both were ENORMOUS and very tasty. The back patio is lovely on a sunny day as well."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The owners are super friendly and the menu has something for everyone. Savory and sweet. Yum, yum, yum."}
