{"text":"Not sure why I am defending a place that is closed but once upon a time, when Ralph still owned the joint, it was a good place to eat then they sold it to Long Wong's and it went right into the dumper. Oh well I still have some fond memories of the place."}
{"text":"W and I walked across the street to take advantage of the 25 cent wing special they have on Mondays. We ordered a dozen wings, a bacon cheeseburger, and an order of the homemade meatballs.  All were pretty terrible. I can go into further detail, but just don't go."}
{"text":"When I lived in Deer Valley we would go to Ralph's at least once a week. With Ralph, Ann and Betty you always felt like you were their best friends. The Sicilian was the best. The last time I was there was in 1983 the day before I moved to Rochester. I'll always have fond memories of Ralph's.

{"text":"This place used to be the best place you could ever walk in and get pizza 30 years ago...it was sad to see it fall apart and go downhill. I guess good things never last :("}
{"text":"Ralph's was always great! I really wish I could get in touch with the family so I can recreate that  salad dressing at home! Sad it's closed. We were always treated well and loved the food!"}
{"text":"I sure miss this Pizza place and so does my family! When he opened many years ago we installed the ceiling fans there and also the buzzer on the freezer. He was right around the corner from my home and the place was always packed full. His Italian dressing was the best I have ever had, and having been raised in Italy I am sad I will never have it again! Hoping that some of the family members just realize how loved they were, and how we appreciated the years of hard work and dedication, thank you...Susie"}
{"text":"I gotta side with Ricardo, even if for no other reason than I have nothing better to do right now than write reviews of restaurants that no longer exist for my own entertainment (and hopefully yours).  

20 years ago, we lived in a small community 2 hours away from Ralph's.  There was a neighborhood pact...if anyone was headed for the Phoenix area, they took orders from every household on the street and picked up a truckload of Ralph's pizzas and brought them back for everybody.  

Ralph still cooked and the pizza was amazing.  The atmosphere was great and Ralph was friendly and sweet.  Whoever got it from him drove it right into the ground and our pizza experience has never been the same.  Goodbye, Ralph's!"}
