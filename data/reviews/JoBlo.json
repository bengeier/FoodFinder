{"text":"J'y suis allée à plusieurs reprises avec mon conjoint tellement que nous adorons cet endroit. Portions ultra généreuses, décor original, bonne ambiance, service courtois.   Après avoir essayé divers burgers, le SPUTNIK est sans contredit toute une expérience : boulette de boeuf, saucisse ENTIÈRE au cheddar fumé, bacon, Suisse, choucroute, sauce Russe.   Le burger végétarien PURPLE HAZE est aussi très bon. Le burger GROS PORC avec du mac&cheese - oui oui ! - est également bon quoiqu'il manque un peu de saveur dans le fromage."}
{"text":"Très bonne brasserie dans un décor unique. Essayez les burgers, la viande est très bien cuite et la quantité dans l'assiette est assez importante.  Les serveurs sont très accueillants et très drôles ! Bref pour un bon pub où l'on a envie de manger un petit quelque chose, je le recommande."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot of good things and decided to grab a burger there one Friday night.    We started with the sausage pogos and they were quite tasty, but the casing was so firm they were difficult to eat.  When I ordered, I asked for the burger to be as rare as it could be, medium rare being my preference.  I was informed that it was illegal to serve a burger cooked less than well done if the meat is not ground on the premises.  When my burger (called Le Madame Beauchamp) arrived it was definitely well done.  The texture was dry and a bit crumbly and even the coleslaw didn't really help.  The processed orange cheese was a let down too.  For a 15$ burger, it did not meet expectations.  A fun looking place, but for 15$ you would think they could at least use real cheese and grind their own meat.  I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"Restaurant et personnel anti-enfants  Nous étions à ce restaurant pour la fête d'une amie avec notre bébé de 16 mois qui marche.  C'est un très mauvais restaurant avec un enfant.    1. Pas de chaise haute 2. Pas de table à Langer 3. On vous demande d'arriver avec une poussette pliante au téléphone même s'il y a VRAIMENT de la place pour la laisser ouverte. 4. Aucune empathie envers le bébé et ses besoins particuliers de la part du serveur (chaise, repas plus rapide pour le faire patienter...). 5.Alors que nous avions apporté un siège à fixer sur une chaise, bébé est resté tranquille pendant près d'une heure trente, à la fin du repas, comme il s'impatientait, je l'ai laissé explorer en le suivant de près.  La serveuse est venu m'avertir de ne pas jouer près de la fenêtre, car c'est fragile. (!!!) 6. Le serveur ma dit de retirer les chaussure de mon bébé (qui sont quand même très propres) quand il est debout sur le sofa de \"cuirette\" facilement lavable avec un linge s'il le salit.  Bref, le repas était bon, mais l'expérience pénible.  Je ne vois pas pourquoi on devrait discriminer les familles en ne les accommodant pas le temps d'un repas."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the restaurant, the decor inside is great! The food was delicious, had the Film Western burger. Bacon, sausage, beef, sauerkraut, and jalapeño peppers. It was huge! Very tasty, with a really big helping of fries too, the included spicy mayo went great with them.  One thing we really didn't like: the inside was freaking freezing."}
{"text":"Great location, really nice atmosphere and ambiance. Service is excellent as well as the food.  Anyone looking for a different dining experience should try this, I absolutely love the decor (specially the horse lamps ^^).  Mac and cheese is a must!  Nothing more to say, just go and you will have a great meal in a cool environment !"}
{"text":"This place used to be much better when they had they're previous menu. Every item on them menu had odd component to it that didn't match with the rest of the ingredients and everything that had sauce on it, was grainy as if they put raw flour in it."}
{"text":"Really good food and vibe!! Do not judge by the outside!! Great staff and decor! Group next to us was really loud, but clearly having a good night! Great for couples or groups of couples! Will go again!!"}
{"text":"Un coin parfait pour les amateurs de viande. Beaucoup de choix et de goût en terme de burger mais aussi de nombreux plats à côté à essayer ! Un décor à voir par soi-même! Un bel accueil du personnel. Petit plus : un coin sur le côté pour recevoir un petit groupe."}
{"text":"En tant que Verdunois nous n'avions pas encore pris le temps de tester ce restaurant mais nous n'avons pas été déçus, nous sommes allé un samedi soir après 9pm et nous avons été très bien reçu par un serveur très sympathique. Le décor est superbe et la bouffe, en plus d'être excellente nous a été servi rapidement. On y retournera probablement régulièrement !"}
{"text":"No more to-die-for caramelized onion and bacon Mac and cheese. It's closed and I'm sad."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice, not silent, but not too loud. The service is very good. Had \"Le Detective \" a basic hamburger. While it was tasty, I found it rather messy to eat and the texture not that good.   The French fries were well dine and their tangy mayonnaise simply a welcome change from ketchup."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to go on a cold, rainy Thursday evening when the restaurant was pleasantly empty with only 3 other parties present. The restaurant was warm and welcoming with its decor and ambience...perfect for a date night.   The waiter was sweet and attentive, my filet was cooked perfectly, the mojitos were strong, and the dulce de leche cake was sinfully delicious. My friend had the Mae West, a wonderfully seasoned grilled chicken served with a large spinach salad. He ate all of his and finished off what I couldn't of my filet mignon, potatoes, and green beans.   I have happily recommended this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues who live nearby. If you get lucky and happen to go on a night when it's pretty empty, you can have a very romantic evening in this restaurant with its sexy atmosphere and chill music playing in the background. It was a perfect ending to a long day, and a wonderful beginning to a great night."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide whether to award 3 or 4 stars to JoBlo because I think my review sits at around 3.5ish.. Here's why:  Pros: 1. Awesome decor - they have really cool pieces of furniture here unlike any restaurant I've ever seen 2. Nice ambiance - when you're sitting here, you feel like you've been transported back a few decades and it's done quite well 3. Their portions are MASSIVE - I've been twice and have never been able to finish my meal! 4. Prices are pretty average 5. Service is good  Cons 1. The food is just OK.. Nothing out of this world. I've had both the Mac n cheese (quite good) and the smoked meat sandwich (have had better) and have nothing to rave about. Their sloppy joe nachos were pretty good though... But that's about it from my experience 2. Their drinks are disappointing - I've tried a total of five different cocktails here and none of them have been good.....   So, although there are more pros than cons, they don't do so well in the department most importantly pertaining to a restaurant which is flavor.  So an overall funky restaurant which mediocre food and drink..meh.."}
{"text":"Un restaurant tout à fait unique situé sur la rue Wellington à Verdun. Un univers à lui seul, il faut le dire... Le décor est tout simplement fou! Que dire de la tenue des serveurs, wow! On a vraiment l'impression d'entrer dans un monde à part.  Lorsque j'y suis allée le personnel était hyper accueillant et très professionnel. On s'assurait toujours qu'il ne nous manque rien. La nourriture était excellente! On y offre des plats de type \" comfort food \" classiques, mais revisités. De plus, les prix sont tout à fait raisonnables pour la nourriture, quoi qu'ils m'ont semblés un peu élevés pour les cocktails.   J'aimerais y aller plus souvent pour fêter des anniversaires, par exemple, mais le restaurant ne prend pas les réservations, dommage! Ce n'est pas très pratique lorsqu'on prévoit être un groupe de 12 personnes. L'endroit est pas mal toujours rempli, c'est donc difficile d'avoir une place pour autant de gens.   J'y retournerai certainement pour essayer d'autres plats, miam!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely helpful and sweet. Food was excellent. The venue was absolutely stunning. Would definitely come back again next time I am in Montreal"}
{"text":"Had the burger and yummy fries here . along with many many drinks....which I would name but I can't seem to find their drink menu on line. Needless to say, the food was excellent and the service nice.   I would definitely good back and try with of the other food besides the burger as everything my dinner companions had looked good.  I also enjoyed the interesting decor."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. What more can I say. Each time I come here am never disappointed. The Méchant Boris is amazing for anyone who loves smoked meat. The burgers are completely sinful, and their mac and cheese....woah.   I keep coming back here for more. The staff is amazing, they always wanna be sure that everything was enjoyed and the owner she is amazing. Really enjoying the whole prohibition/pin-up theme"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. Also have an extended cocktail menu which is refreshing in a city like Montreal! They know their drinks, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe, the decor is awesome, so is the music, the service and the cocktails.  I was craving a good burger and this place didnt deliver.  First of all my meat wasnt browned with any crust at all, it was grey and soft. I like blue cheese but their sauce overwhelmed the taste of the meat and my I'm pretty sure my mushrooms were right out of the can without even being fried first.  The fries were the best part of my meal, the perfect combination of homestyle and crispy.  This place is happening but unfortunately the food is not."}
{"text":"I went alone on a Thursday evening. I did not have a reservation and I decided to sit at the bar. I was comfortable on the wooden bar stool (something hard to achieve for me). It was around 19h00. The staff looked very busy. Even with all the activity, the sound level was very acceptable.   I was immediately welcomed with a glass of water and a bunch of menues. The bartender (I think she is either the manager or the owner or both), was serving me. Service was very pleasant and friendly.  The food was excellent. I had the soup of the day: a spicy tomatoe and cabbage delight served with bread lightly toasted on the grill. I then had the filet mignon. I ordered blue and got medium rare but I did not mind. It was tender and tasty. It came with a side salad, green beans and I took mashed potatoes. Now if you don't like chunky mashed potatoes, you may be better off with the fries.  They have a great selection of funky drinks (cesars served with burger sliders etc) and very decent espresso.   I will totally go back. I just have to make sure I have at least an hour and a half to dine.  Love the \"leg lamp\". It reminds me of my favorite Christmas movie."}
{"text":"Be HUNGRY! Large portions ahead if you eat here. Everyone seemed genuinely pleased with their orders (sloppy joe for me, two western burgers and two veggie options). Coleslaw a little too spicy for me but otherwise all good. Neat, clean, good service, good prices, nice selection of drinks (had the Margarita quite potent and well-mixed-though a little heavy on the rim salt).  Back to the Sloppy Joe...carnivore heaven! Well sauced, nice big chunks of the chicken and the pork that you could taste through the beefy Sloppy Joe handmade yummy sauce. Next time I'll have a Pimms on the terrace with a Purple Haze veggie burger."}
{"text":"Wellington has grown into a pretty vibrant street, and Joblo has definitely helped with its arrival! From the outide with its simple neon sign, I felt a bit of odd apprehension, but when I got in, it was amazing! (Picture Giant Horse Lamps and Machine Gun Lamps... I know, you can't, right?) Brick wall, painted wall, a wall with little sparkly tiles, and these overhead lamps that reminded me of spiders!  The menus are still in its \"ghetto\" phase (photocopy pages, without formatting ie. using line breaks) which my Toronto friends commented that its the first time they've seen a crowd so big at a resto with paper menus.  The menu doesn't disappoint, we did a 3 person split on nachos, mac and cheese, and a pork burger with swiss, apple, and coleslaw. The items all have cute names, Like The Hula Hoop, Miss Beauchamp, etc. and the food was generously portioned & delish!  For dessert we split the Chocolate Mousse and \"White Cake\" Cake, and a slice of the coconut pie.   Although service took a wee bit longer, it was really busy, but honestly, Verdun, you've come a long way, and Joblo - amazing!"}
{"text":"I would come back for the apps, ambience, friendly staff, and maybe I'd stick to pork or smoked meat for the main. All of the beef burgers here are cooked well done, no choice offered from what we experienced, and that plus something in the grind of the beef left the patty tasting grainy and unappetizing. I went in hungry enough to eat a horse lamp (they have those) and ended up maoing through much of the oversized portion of fries and the burger bun and toppings and everything else around, rather than eat the meat itself. This is a problem in a burger joint, in my humble opinion, but there's certainly lots of other stuff to like about JoBlo."}
{"text":"Février 2016: changement de menu, il faut y aller pour le steak car c'est ce qu'il y a en majorité sur le menu qui n'a qu'une page entrées et desserts inclus. J'adorais les burgers avant, mais il ne reste que 2 choix. Un avec de la sauce et l'autre au fromage bleu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance and pricing. The soup of the day was red pepper, cauliflower and garlic - delicious and the pepper sauce burger was fresh and well served. I really liked the waiters dress code and the decoration of the place. Very recomendable."}
{"text":"Un endroit au décor fou, au manger réconfortant et au style éclatant.  A essayer absolument, les cocktails ainsi que la poutine monstrueuse Red light !"}
{"text":"Super resto sur la rue piétonnière de quartier chinois. Le canard bbq chinois juste trop Miam à conseiller. Belle ambiance de resto chinois, services très rapide. 395/10"}
{"text":"Nouvelle année, nouveau resto!  Depuis seulement 2 semaines, il y a un nouveau resto dans Verdun qui vaut la peine d'être découvert. Ça faisait un p'tit bout qu'il n'y avait pas de nouveau resto dans le quartier, et JoBlo emmène avec lui un vent de fraîcheur.  L'ambiance et le décor vous feront penser que vous êtes dans un resto hipster du Plateau. Vous aurez plusieurs options entre les divans en cuirs et les chaises en aluminium, des petites tables intimes pour 2 personnes, d'autres plus grandes pour les groupes ou bien une place au bar. Certaines lampes ont des fusils comme pied alors que 2 autres sont sur des chevaux (ou bien des chevreuils selon votre interprétation.)  Pour le menu, ont vous propose des plats classiques et réconfortants. Du \"soul-food\" québécois incluant du pâté chinois, des sloppy joes, du pain de viande ou bien plusieurs burgers variés. Les frites ressemblent presque à des hash-browns faits maison. Les portions sont généreuses et les plats arrivent bien chauds. Le menu des cocktails et des vins est aussi très bien. J'ai pris un verre de Pimms mais vu qu'il faisait presque moins 20, j'ai aussi été tentée par le cidre chaud épicé.  Le gilet à manches longues en rayures noires, le chapeau melon et les bretelles donnent une allure du Charlie Chaplin aux hommes, ou bien celle du mime que l'on voit sur les écrans du métro! Les serveurs sont tous très gentils et souriants puis ils n'hésitent pas à vous demander si tout va bien même s'ils ne sont pas dédiés à votre table.  J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner dans quelques semaines, ou bien quelques mois pour essayer leur macaroni au fromage qui n'était plus disponible lors de la soirée où j'y suis allée."}
{"text":"I don't know about every restaurant in the city. I know that statement shouldn't be a surprise but sometimes people get the impression that I know every possible restaurant in Montreal. And yes, while I do know my fair share, even I can get surprised by a place I've never heard of before. This is one of those moments. For the event of the birthday of a friend of my girlfriend's, I was invited for dinner to a place on Wellington in Verdun that I had driven by numerous times before but never noticed... JoBlo.  Such a unique vibe to this place. Strong burlesque 1920s-1930s speakeasy feel to the room but with a twist. Nat King Cole playing in the background. Big leather seats, old portraits and posters framed up but then you add the machine gun lamps, the staff all dressed in French mime attire (without the makeup) and a huge wooden horse right by the entrance. It's weird, it's strange but it worked for me. When the restaurant's private group room is called the Betty Boo room and has huge pop art Betty Boo on the walls, you know this place had a unique style.  Drink wise, I enjoyed the scope of their cocktail menu. I got to try their gin fizz and the mojito. The gin fizz was a little too lemony for me. The foamy texture was perfect though. The mojito was solid - exactly what I would have expected from a proper mojito.  JoBlo calls itself a steakhouse and while yes they do have steak on the menu, the food is much more comfort food oriented. The menu is much more centered around burgers, mac n' cheese and Sloppy Joes. As a starter, my girlfriend and I shared le \"Squiggly Diddly\" - home made fried calamari with tomato sauce. Portion wise very generous and pretty tasty to boot. The calamari had a nice crisp to them while still being the right level of tenderness. Tomato sauce was okay but truthfully not memorable.  As a main course, my girlfriend went with the \"Sloppy JoBlo\" - their version of the Sloppy Joe with home fries. Served on a toasted pun, it was absolutely uneatable as an actual burger which I suppose is what a sloppy joe should be - sloppy and saucy. The meat filling was pretty good - strong tomato sauce flavour with some tang. A very generous portion of fries to go with it - the style of fries which one would get at a true pataterie which I love so that worked for me.  On my end, I went with the \"Gros Porc\" because I am a glutton and couldn't help it.... mac n'cheese, onions and bacon on a pork patty. Yeah that's right... mac n' cheese in the burger. Completely ridiculous I know and almost impossible to eat as a burger but I still succeeded in grabbing it as a burger. Loved the pork, the smokiness and crispness of the bacon, the sweet onions but let's be honest... this thing is all about the mac n'cheese. Loved the creaminess of the macaron but felt like it lacked some sharpness. A different cheese blend would have probably helped to create a more distinct flavour. The noodles were also a bit too big for use in a burger but that's really nitpicking. Another large portion of fries was provided as well. I liked this burger but didn't love it like I had hoped.  JoBlo was an interesting experience given I had absolutely no expectations going in. Loved the portion sizes and the general ideas behind the menu. I had a few small issues over the course of the night such that while I enjoyed the food, I didn't love it completely. Definitely worth another look... if only for the great look and vibe of the joint.   Cheers!"}
