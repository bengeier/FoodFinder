{"text":"Great place to eat. The place is pretty clean the staff is very friendly and the good is great! Come on and get a bagel!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Convenient location when passing through town!"}
{"text":"Realistically when you enter a bagel place don't expect to be blown away by anything but the bagels,schmear and coffee. I have never been into an Einstein before but was there yesterday morning and was very delighted by the pleasant staff and bagels available. Some of the bagels I wanted  to go weren't available but the wonderful man taking my order said if I was planning on eating there, the bagels they had in the oven would be done. The place isn't spotless but for the area it is in I am happy to see pleasant/polite people who have wonderful customer service and so I didn't take away any points for that. I do wish they had the pumpkin bagel but I am happy with the bagels I am now eating this morning and because of that will try and get there earlier to grab a pumpkin bagel!"}
{"text":"Einstein's is great! They have darn good coffee, a great selection of bagels and bagel sandwiches.  Some food suggestions are cinnamon sugar with honey bagel, double chocolate chip muffin and the turkey sasuage with cheddar and egg (egg whites available) bagel sandwich. Lots of cream cheese selections also available including reduced calorie options.  Great place for breakfast, lunch or evenings!"}
{"text":"I've never had Einstein Brother's Bagels before and only came because of a coupon/flyer that was in our local Sunday State Journal. So my fiancee and I decided to give it a try. We ordered the \"Bagel Thin Club\" and \"Chipotle Chicken\" salad. Neither was very good and the staff here just wasn't attentive enough.   The bagel had way to much sauce on it, it was almost soggy maybe from the gigantic tomato that they placed on it? The salad didn't seem very fresh and was unfulfilling. The salad ran $5.00 which was far too much considering its size.   If I go back it won't be this location and I wouldn't recommend anything off there healthy menu as it doesn't hit the spot."}
{"text":"This Einstein's has seen better days. We stopped here on a road trip to grab a bagel and coffee and it was dirty.  They only had one coffee available (Vanilla Hazelnut) so we we disappointed with that lack of selection."}
{"text":"Whatever Einstein Bros. serves, it is not a bagel.  Bagels are boiled, and Einstein serves up a round, puffy, baked roll with a hole in the middle.  No boiling involved, since that is time-consuming, i.e., expensive, and creates real bagels with a chewy consistency.  You might like their rolls, but they really shouldn't call them bagels."}
