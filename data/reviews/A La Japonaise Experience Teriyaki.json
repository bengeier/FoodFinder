{"text":"This is the one place I found where they don't give you crazy amounts of rice.  And I was surprised by how tasty the tofu teriyaki bowl was. Was on the sweeter side but still good. I went by the cashiers recommendations cause I generally don't eat veg. 5 stars for taste and decent amount of rice & about just a minutes wait time !"}
{"text":"We ran into the food court at the Eaton Center while we were out shopping today.    Grabbed something that didn't look like junk food at Teriyaki -  it was pretty disappointing.   They didn't even try to give me anything but a plate of undercooked and overly salted noodles with some sad chicken on top.    Nice guys working there but I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. At first I didn't think anything of it but later it dawned on me that this was the failed franchise in the City if I remembered it sooner I would not have came here. 

Food was a bit meh. I had the chicken stir fry which was flavorless.  The gyoza wasn't that good either. The kids had udon soup noodles and they complained that the soup was spicy. 

Service was friendly. I'm not a fan if the franchise so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a relatively balanced meal (junk food vs healthy) this is not a bad choice. While they usually put too much sauce, if you love your food like than you got to the right place. 
The thing that bugs me the most about Teriyaki is that all the place around them in the Easton center give some sort of a promotion. Some will give 10% or a free drink to students, other will have a free loyalty card or a card you can receive some of the purchase back but not Teriyaki. And well since they are not amazing or stand above other Asian location at the Eaton center I tend to visit them only on rare ovations."}
