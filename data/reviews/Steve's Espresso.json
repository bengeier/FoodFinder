{"text":"Been to Steve's a few times.  Time for a review.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  + Good ambiance.  Low lighting and sweet music.  I really enjoy studying here.  + Slightly above average coffee.  I've had better, but Steve's still has really good drinks.  + Awesome prices.  I'm in college and I really like saving my money.  -/+ Customer service is alright.  One time I was there only one barista working.  He was obviously a high school student and had other important things going on.  Two of his friends came in and chatted him up at the counter... and they weren't quiet.  Then, he left the counter, with no one else there, to go outside for a smoke and talk with his little friends.  Nothing happened in result, but I thought it was rude."}
{"text":"We found Steve's in a corner of a strip mall- took a chance and ordered 2 Americanos, a macchiato( Starbucks style) and a few cookies. All were delivered promptly without smile or much interaction... But not in a small hip Portland style surliness- they seemed disinterested. The coffee was unremarkable but cookies were fresh.  All in all- an easy place to stop if you are looking for coffee at Baseline and McClintock....and don't want to travel any further."}
{"text":"Having broken the grip of the evil empire, I have been in search of local coffee houses close to my home and work that are worth supporting.  Steve's Espresso does not disappoint.  I have been visiting for a little over 6 months or so on a weekly basis, and although the 4 revolving cashiers could not tell me my name or preempt my drink order, Steve actually sat me down one day and suggested a cheaper version of the drink I ordered daily.  This wasn't movie theater upsize to a \"better value\" kind of sale, which I appreciated.  The vibe is laid back, decent music, copy of the USA Today, delicious homemade breakfast and snacks (cinnamon roll is amazing), and most importantly, some of the best local coffee in the Tempe area.  Cappuccinos aren't watered down; foam thick enough to lay a penny on; remarkably fast service by the baristas who are always cheerful.  Steve can usually be found lording over his staff if he isn't a few feet away making his signature buttery delights.  No wifi, no problem.  Steve's proudly advertises no wifi, a common complaint by some of the previous reviewers.  I don't have a problem with this.  I am not a coffee shop dweller or internet leach.  Some people are more than happy to set up a basecamp in coffee shops, short of rigging a cot next to their work/study station.  For some places and some people, I guess that's fine but there is something to be said for the lost art of talking to your company, reading a paper, or just tuning out for a short time.  We are already too spoiled a society as it is that we should black list a local business with a good model simply because we are too cheap to use our own data plans or can't pitch a tent inside a coffee shop all day and spend $3.90, soaking on theirs.  Go for the coffee, not the internet."}
{"text":"Great place!! Best coffee I've had in the close vicinity for sure!!! Also they have wonderful homemade pastries and frittata. Patient, quick and friendly staff. A great find in my neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Went this morning with my 4 month old for a quick relaxed breakfast and cup of coffee.  A few months back they did away with free WiFi and i think it made the atmosphere more inviting. No more wifi moochers spending hours camped at tables and sofas. It feels more like a place you could easily have a conversation with a friend.  The customer service was polite and fast. Had the Jalapeno Cheddar Fritatta and a Iced Americano (about $6.50 total). I'll be back for both."}
{"text":"Oh my god the breakfast tacos!!!! Don't order if you don't like spicy. If you do, you're welcome. ;)"}
{"text":"Love the coffee, great people friendly and polite. No Wi- Fi cool place to read my books. I get my computer stuff done at home so no big. Like to see updated toaster, usually just go for the coffee."}
{"text":"Great coffee  Great place Great mugs Awesome service  I think they make their own cookies and pastries."}
{"text":"I really like going to this place when I am in the area. The ambiance is interesting, the music is pretty loud and the decor is all burgundy and orange and it's comfortable to be inside. The coffee is really solid and the food is made in house unlike the food at other coffee joints. I like the sun dried tomato and mushroom brioche and the Aztec mocha. Stop by this place if you are around, it is worth your time and will provide a good break in the middle of the workday. My only real beef with this place is that you have to heat up your food after they made it in the microwave, oh well!   The employees are also rad here! Really friendly, solid spot!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Steve's for 9 years now and I drink his regular coffee not his espresso drinks. His coffee is French pressed and hands down the smoothest in town .. and anywhere for that matter.  When I travel, which includes Seattle sometimes, I feel like I'm slumming it until I get back home to Tempe.  No joke. I personally like a more chocolaty blend of coffee and his medium and bold blends both hit the chocolate high notes square on with NO BITTERNESS. (Beware:  After tasting Steve's coffee, you will not be able to stomach the low quality bitter Starbuck's coffee)  I love it and so does my wife.  She loves his Assam tea which is also world class ... greg"}
{"text":"Ambiance is light, airy, and it was quite busy when I stopped in for a latte and sandwich mid morning. The barista was friendly and provided us with recommendations. The lattes are smooth, not bitter, and don't need any sweetener! In addition, food was up and ready fast. If you enjoy the local flair, I'd suggest stopping by.."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I was looking for a place where I can focus on writing without a wi-fi distraction, and Steve's Espresso offers that and beyond. I love their espresso drinks as well as scones. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good morning coffee :)  I live about 2 blocks from Steve's and I find myself stopping by occasionally before work. As far as I know the owner opens the cafe around 6ish in the morning? I don't really know, seeing as how i need my coffee in order to communicate and I am usually running out the door on my way to work. Drinks are great, the place is clean and the tea selection is outrageous. I have never had a complaint about steve's and I don't think the future will bring dissatisfaction either."}
{"text":"Great Americanos. The espresso beans have a great balance, and the atmosphere is upbeat. I live in the area and think this is one of the best, authentic places to get coffee."}
{"text":"I love Steve's.  Having been here twice now, I feel safe with my conclusion.  Steve's Espresso is tucked away on the side of an obscure strip mall in Tempe.  Most don't even know it is here, which is perfect for an increasingly anti-social nerd like myself.  The atmosphere is a little bit different, too.  While it is like most coffee shops, it is a bit simpler and the music is a bit different.  All of which add to my liking of this place.   Let's not forget the coffee.  While I can admit I may have had better coffee at other places, the espresso at Steve's is very delicious.  And for some reason, I have noticed their Mocha tends to give me a bit more motivation than most places.    I thank @bwilley for having a meeting with me here, because it is now a new fav."}
{"text":"Good coffee at excellent prices.  Steve is nice, ask him about the Economy when you stop by."}
{"text":"I stop by a couple of times a week...love to get the Classic and a cranberry scone. I like the laid back feel of the place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today and got an iced honey-vanilla latte and I was impressed. I'm not a fan of espresso drinks that are too sweet so I was hesitant, but this was great. Just sweet enough, but I could still taste the espresso. I also got a cranberry orange scone and I will definitely be going back for more of those! It was packed with cranberries and was just overall tasty."}
{"text":"Got a double espresso after a long day. Good coffee!! The color scheme is warm and inviting. The food is ok, if it was better id give it 5 stars. Stellar pick for coffee though. I do wish it was open later!!"}
{"text":"The best coffee in town and wonderful home made scones.  My daily ritual is to stop at Steve's"}
{"text":"I love this place. They truly have the best coffee drinks in town.  The scones are out of this world and so are the brioche.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Almond Milk Latte! Great place to get coffee with friends or grab lunch...not so great for studying (no-Wifi)."}
{"text":"Locally roasted beans. Really great espresso. French pressed coffee. Made-from-scratch baked goods. Servers know coffee. Fun jazzy soundtrack. Free WiFi.  What more do you need? I've been going to this place on and off for ten years, and their espresso has always been among the best. I just wish I would've been smart enough to buy a house closer by!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, but every time I have, the atmosphere has been very chill and the service has been fast. I just tried their chai today- made by Steve himself. Don't be fooled by the fact your milk won't turn that pink/rust color- the chai is excellent. It's a little sweet, but very smooth with an even blend of spices. I hope to see a real spicy chai from them someday. Also had some of their espresso- very even flavors. Bravo. Barista was very knowledgable."}
{"text":"tried going here on new years day.  was met with \"closed\" disappointment,  but i should have known better.  i'm glad i went back as this was my 1st trip to steves, tho surely not my last.  i took  picture of the delicious  aztec mocha .... a big cup of love as my roommate said.  and the breakfast brioche was tasty.  plus a snickerdoodle ... not a bad way to start your sunday.  the staff were really friendly and i'm sure could hold court on any conversation.  the music was laid back and loud enough to enjoy and still soft enough to speak to one another.  in a nutshell, it's always fun to find a cool coffee shop, and this one goes down as one of the coolest.  i'm guessing i am late to this discovery....  what has kept me away?  might make it a staple from now on."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall coffee shop with good atmosphere, even if it's in a strip mall.  My step-brother took me to his local brew house the day after Christmas.  We sat at the outside tables and had good early morning convo.    I had the french press coffee: House Blend and French Roast -- both fantastic.  Being from San Francisco, I liked it so much I felt compelled to buy a pound and bring it home.  I kept getting whiffs of the tasty aroma coming from my carry-on, causing me to salivate like Pavlov's dogs."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times. The french press is what I have purchased all of those times, and its excellent. Smooth tasty cup of joe, at a cheap price, and a great atmosphere. I'm not one to loiter around coffee houses too long, but if I were to do a little bit of loitering this would be the place to loiter. They have a great selection of teas, as previously mentioned. Steves is recommended."}
{"text":"Great coffee  Comfortable environment  The barristas need to wear more stripes   Update 26 April 2013: Just found out I am a supertaster, you can get the test strips from amazon.  I'll bet Steve's patrons have a higher percentage of supertasters than regular coffee shops.   Update 29Jan2014: Steve's Espresso is now run by his younger, thinner, and more stylish nephew Esteban Herrera  Esteban is considering changing the present rectangular art to rhombus, parallelogram, or perhaps even trapezoid shaped art."}
{"text":"Cozy coffee spot. I love the music selection. Friendly staff - smiling even dealing with other annoying, needy customers I witnessed. Coffee is smooth and tasty. Could come here for a beer, wine, or alcohol too. The frittatas and the breakfast tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"Good coffee but no wifi! Seriously. Had to use Peter piper's wifi next door which of course didn't work great. Truly inexplicable."}
{"text":"Our #1 coffee stop of all time. Delicious coffees, baked goods, snacks and meals. The highlights are the coffee drinks. It's as good if we go once every few days or 3-4 in a row. Ice coffee, mocha Europa, Azteca, Italian Sodas. You can't go wrong. Nice atmosphere, always have excellent music go"}
{"text":"My thesis statement: As far as trapped-in-stripmall coffeehouses go, Steve's Espresso is great.  Nothing fancy about the seating arrangements - basic tables and chairs, plus four leather chairs set by the door for leasurely reading-chatting (lots of reading material available behind the espresso machine). Walls are a warm, dark orange - not quite burnt sienna/raw umber territory but leaning in that direction (yeah, I view the world according to Crayola, wanna fight about it?) with random local art hanging. Light is just enough to do your reading/working, not too bright. Music selection is perfect: smooth electro-Brazilian-lounge stuff that you can easily put in the background and not let it distract you, but still relaxing.   As for the food and drink offerings: pastries/cookies for eats. Don't know if they actually make anything sandwich-wise (if they don't, I'd recommend going to Little India in the same shopping center for some chaat and then coming here). My medium decaf soy latte was decent - nothing amazing but the soy milk wasn't burnt or curdled so that's a plus. Barista was extremely courteous, and even threw away a shot he wasn't impressed with.  Their advertised free-WiFi wasn't working tonight - so the rating's going to slip a little, but not too much. Every coffeehouse has their WiFi snafus now and then, and I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt that this doesn't happen too often.  Crowd looks mostly like ASU upperclassmen/grad students working on an assortment of theses, and I get the feeling that's the usual evening scene here. Mellow and not too loud, so a great place to get your work done. They're only open till 10 though, which for a student-heavy coffeehouse seems a little odd.   In conclusion, I'd say Steve's Espresso is a great coffeehouse for what it is. If I lived closeby I could definitely see myself coming here often, with or without a laptop. However, I don't live closeby - so who knows how many future trips I'll be making.   Rating: About 3.93 stars - round up to 4. *Almost* red-orange (or is it orange-red?).   Worth a trip if you're in the 'hood."}
{"text":"It is just dismal those few times you want something to eat at the coffee house, and your choices are sad breakfast offerings or overpriced bakery items.  But I am vouching for Steve's food!... bacon, jalepeno & cheese frittata (w/ thin sliced potatoes as the bottom layer) as well as the ham & cheese stuffed brioche!  You do have to heat yourself.. luckily the microwave does have power settings, so go PL-7 or 8 to avoid overcooking as you heat.    These guys are open early (5:30am M-F and 6:30am S-S)... so this is going to be my new go to place to grab some food when I have an early morning  flight or roadtrip."}
{"text":"I've only had a plain old latte at Steve's on a few occasions, but they have made it perfectly every time. Some day I'll try some of their food...but for now, the latte gives them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I wandered in here a few months ago while waiting for my rental car to be ready, and I was immediately charmed. A very cute shop with a simple and easy menu. They have great options for dairy sensitivities, and the staff is very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I've been hooked on their coffee for years but the salads, sandwiches and wraps they're now serving have me totally addicted. Maybe we should form a Steve's Espresso Junkies support group. We could meet at, you know, Steve's."}
{"text":"We walk here every weekend with the family to get coffee and a snack. Today was our first time trying the in house homemade Brioche. The breakfast Brioche is Amazing!!! Stevens always seems to surprise us with some sort of awesome."}
{"text":"Best feature: The Vibe  Alright, so I'm a Barista at another coffee shop and I've decided to review every coffee place except my own.  That being said, Steve's espresso is one of my favorite's at the moment.  Actually, it's kinda becoming my standard first date place(I think the Baristas are giving me the \"I know what's up\" look).  Their lattes are great; smooth and palpable.  At night (where most of my experience lays, ha) they play these sleepy grooves that you just barely notice.  The art on the wall is Arizona twilight meets shiny 8th grader art project - I love it.    The Barista that I usually get is pretty cool.  He's really quiet and a great shot puller!  I think his name is Drew."}
{"text":"I miss you Steve's Espresso. You were in my old hood, and I used to visit you frequently.  Now I am without a great local coffee shop with free WIFI.  Steve's has great tea and espresso drinks, I've tried both. Comfortable seating is all over the place. I could go there and get work done in peace. It has a very chill atmosphere and the employees were always super cool. Even the bathroom is nice.   I really enjoyed our time together Steve's Espresso, and I am sorry I had to leave you."}
{"text":"This is my go-to coffee house in Tempe.  I love that they offer almond milk and their mocha is delicious.  By the way, if you haven't ever had an almond milk mocha, get one here.  I was actually here this morning at 9:30am and they were out of almond milk, but I'm sure that was just a glitch in the matrix.  I also appreciate the seating they provide.  There's a good number of tables and chairs and couches inside, as well as a few tables out front.  It's the perfect spot for a quick meeting, a quiet place to catch up on emails, or just enjoy a cup of joe."}
{"text":"TL;DR : Great espresso and home made pastries, but the worst customer service.  I went here for the first time with my boyfriend yesterday at about 9:30 am. I am from Washington but live in Tempe now, and miss having a regular spot to go to.  When we arrived there were 2 baristas working, one was a smaller Asian girl with long hair and the other a shorter blonde who looked as though she might be in training. It was a slow day with maybe 5 customers already seated and reading books sipping coffee.  We were not greeted upon entering. We walked up to the counter and did not get a smile or greeting from either girl. Big smile from me and I mentioned that it was our first time here in the hopes of sparking some sort of welcome. NO reply, no explanation of drinks, nothing. Just blank stares. We ordered and the drinks were made. The blonde girl was on the bar, made the drinks and slammed the first one on the counter with no call-out of which it was or whose it was. The same went for mine.   We drank our coffee and the quality was excellent, the European style mocha and latte were delicious. However with customer service like that I will absolutely not be back. I have never felt so unwelcome!  There is a lot of competition in the area and good customer service is what sets you apart. I manage an espresso shop back home and would be appalled to learn my employees were acting in this way. I hope some action will be taken to train your baristas in how to properly greet and serve customers, as you have lost what could have been a daily customer with this experience."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Tempe FOR SURE! Drew is the best at drinks :)"}
{"text":"Love this place - you can get a good \"hardcore\" coffee or a nice, tasty mocha. It also gets a nice blend of clients, and I never see it too full of hipsters or too full of laptops.  A great independent business - stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a double espresso.  It was prepared as it should be and I enjoyed it.  Nice ambiance and music not too loud."}
{"text":"My daughter introduced me to this gem of a place! Cute, quaint & delicious food! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like Steve's. The sign is wierd and I get visions of Freddy Kruger when I pass the place, but the coffee is good. Local stuff. The place is good for working.  First time I went in I got kinda \"my sh*% don't stink\" kinda vibe from the barista. It is kinda offputting, so I stayed away for a bit, but have gone back and haven't had any issues.  I prefer Solo down the street, but when I am here and it's convenient, I go to Steve's. Good coffee, good workspace. The end."}
{"text":"Coffee is so so..do not order the frittata's! So weird that you have to microwave it yourself. And then its just bland. Also- no wi-fi???"}
{"text":"The coffee fairies were on my side today! Needed coffee today, I used the magic power of yelp to locate the nearest place & found an awesome hidden local shop! I'd driven by it dozens of times, didn't know it was there. That's the power of yelp! I had a caramel latte, yum! Great price, hopping shop but plenty of indoor & outdoor seating! I'll definitely go back, now that yelp has showed me the way! And now I see that my Yelper friends have been there as well, definitely a hot spot!"}
{"text":"Not a chain cafe, but not a dive either! Good equipment and capable staff behind the counter. Good quality coffee and food. There are a couple of hearty quiche options in the display case. Low prices. (A medium cup of decaf French press + a chocolate chip cookie cost less than $4.)   My first visit was on a rainy weekday morning. About 4 tables were occupied by customers, and a to-go customer came in about every 10 min. Pleasant, upbeat atmosphere!   No longer offers WiFi."}
{"text":"This quaint strip mall coffee shop is a gem in the Southern Tempe area. After entering their boldly painted space (naartjie orange walls, plum purple ceiling), I was met by a smiling barista who told me they were known for their Aztec Mocha Iced Coffee. Since I had never been here before (coupled with the fact that I was in an adventurous mood), I excitedly ordered the Aztec Mocha. When the barista handed me her final product, my tastebuds were met with a resounding cinnamon and smooth coffee flavored beverage. It was the perfect drink for a scorching afternoon. My only wish this they had another shop that was closer to my house so that I could stop here more often. I would highly recommend Steve's Espresso to any coffee buff."}
{"text":"After reading all of this hype I was expecting Amazingness x 100!!!  I have passed by this place so many times and have never seen it from the street. When I entered I was expecting that warm sense you get from the pictures. I was a little disappointed to say the least.... It looked like a dimly lit cave and they had these weird blue lights on the ceiling that made me feel like I was in a pet store in the reptile section.  The barista was friendly and nice. He made me a giant Carmel Macchiato iced. It tasted pretty good although the choice in cup made me feel like I was at someones house making a smoothie for the pool.   This place was alright, but it definitely didn't have that cozy alive feeling that the pictures showed. If you needed to study and wanted something low key this is great. I think I'm going to stick to Extreme bean and Solo cafe for now."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great atmosphere. Coffee isn't the best I've had, but still better than the chain stuff. I'll be back for sure, and hopefully I just got a bad roast this time."}
{"text":"I ordered a small latte and a frittata both were good.  Nice atmosphere and music.  But when i asked for the wifi password they said there is no wifi which was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee in this part of town. The coffee is roasted locally, and always \"pressed.\" It does make a difference!  The atmosphere is very laid back, it's never too crowded and unpretentious doesn't begin to describe its feel."}
{"text":"I gave them a 3 star because I wanted stuffed brioche that I saw on their website but turned out they stopped making it years ago, was so disappointed when you had it in your mind all day before going there. I also ordered the caramel machiatto, it was good and my hubby got Americano, it was not strong. Overall it was an ok experience, the staff was nice. They need to update their website."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful coffee place! The coffee and the food that we ordered were all delicious, and the baristas were so nice and attentive. They really did go above and beyond with their service. We ordered a few cold trench press coffees, some iced green teas,a dessert plate (apples, honey, walnut and Brie - so good!) and a hummus plate(cucumbers, pita bread, and three types of hummus). They even came outside to check on us a few times and refilled our cucumbers and water glasses! Overall, it was a really great place to sit and chat for a few hours."}
{"text":"I've been to Steve's a dozen times.  There's a lot to like here.  It is locally owned.  The coffee is all locally roasted.  The baked goods (cookies, scones, frittata) are all house made--and if one can catch the chocolate chip cookies right out the oven, they're beyond magnificent.  There's a bookcase with free reading material--books, magazines, and newspapers.  The tables are big enough to stretch out a book and a laptop.    There are downsides.  The internet almost never works (and when it does it is really slow).  The baristas are always happy to reset it but it usually doesn't help.  It's worth it to get a service at Sunset Nails next door to steal their wireless password.  It is often hot--especially in the afternoon.  And then there's the music.  You know the kind of music they make fun of Ian for in High Fidelity?  That's what's usually playing.  Still, the place is never too crowded and while I find the coffee a bit ordinary, the food is great, as is the chill (hipster-free) vibe.  Steve's is a great place to get some work done or sit and read a book."}
{"text":"Good coffee, bought a cup and a pastry planning on studying. Only to find out they had no WiFi after I had spent my money. Thought that was odd for a coffee shop. Otherwise great for a meat up with someone. Unfortunately I need my computer/ internet to get most of my studying done.."}
{"text":"The chai latte was good, but no WiFi?   Probably a good place to chat it up with friends.  Unfortuneately since the chairs are hard and the WiFi disconnected, it doesn't meet my needs.  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"I know many people who used to go there who work and live close and no longer do business there. I go by there every day and go out of my way to go somewhere else. I could hang out there most afternoons and drink coffee but they have purposely made it a place where people don't want to hang out. One morning the owner actually sighed when a coffee was ordered and a pastry was turned down. If I'm going to buy over priced coffee I'm going to go where I can sit and enjoy the atmosphere and feel welcomed, this is not that place."}
{"text":"Had the honey vanilla latte and it was decent. New for me and not something you see on the menu of many coffee places.   Disappointed it was a honey sweetener and not actual honey, could be a great opportunity for a local bee keeper.   Would love to see a chili chocolate tea or coffee drink here!  Great lighting and happy that it's unplugged. It's loud with conversation and unique music."}
{"text":"Vanilla Latte More like little explosions of vanilla on my tongue It was a balanced drink, not too sweet just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Good coffee good atmosphere and a good place to meet up.  I like finding these quaint hidden independently owned coffee houses they are great!   The staff is great since whenever I come in I am only half mast and they must decipher what it is I am trying to request.   Give them a shot (no pun intended) they are worth it!"}
{"text":"I always look forward to stopping here and getting my caramel macchiato!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. My boyfriend and I discovered one morning. We both had iced chais that were amazing. We were hooked. However the next time we came in the chais were too sweet and almost tasted like rice water. I can't say they're bad because we've had both good and bad experiences. Will definitely come back and cross our fingers for some delicious tasting chais or venture off to another drink. The service is great and the atmosphere seems very laid back."}
{"text":"Had a delicious vanilla honey latte and a bacon jalapeño frittata. Great place to meet with co-workers. I really appreciate the staff at Steve's. I left my iPhone under a napkin on the table but didn't realize it until I was at the airport and didn't have time to go back and search for it. It was found by the staff and Nima held it for me until my co-worker was able to pick it up & ship it to me! I will be a Steve's customer for life!!! Thanks Steve's Espresso."}
{"text":"Love the opportunity to come in here. Awesome coffee, friendly staff and very cool and comfy décor.  Karen is typically my barista and she is awesome."}
{"text":"I recently relocated and finding a local coffee shop was a priority for me.  Over the last several months, Steve has suggested variations on my standard drink - all of which have been amazing!  Its refreshing to be in a place that really knows coffee and how to bring out its best qualities.  I just got back from vacation and couldn't wait to get my cup of coffee this morning - none of the coffee shops during vacation held a candle to the flavor of the coffee at Steve's Espresso."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.    I tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.  The person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink.   According to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here."}
{"text":"I spend every Thursday evening at Steve's... and also maybe some time before finals... and after. Its a really chill place to hang out. I love the music, the friendly atmosphere. Every Thursday the same group is there. The Bible study group in the corner, the students studying with their laptops, the loud Russian speaking club... oh that's us! The vanilla syrup is their own creation. I have been inducted into the exclusive elite of those in the know, but I won't divulge. I can replicate that at home, but what I can't get a handle on is how to make such a smooth espresso. Their vanilla lattes are out of this world. I don't usually drink coffee, but I crave vanilla lattes from Steve's. They have a nice selection of teas, but don't trust the little sniffer jars up at the front. I think they have not changed the tea in those little bottles for at least a year, but the tea served to customers is fresh. I'm living one latte to the next."}
{"text":"Went back to this place.  Internet was still awful.  Can't watch any videos.  Mocha is really good.  But they lost a customer for good.  You're a coffee shop, and people come here to study.  If you can't provide adequate internet, then that's a problem, and a foolish one on the owners behalf."}
{"text":"Steve's has great prices for some of the best coffee in Tempe. The space is warmly decorated and inviting, perfect for an after-dinner cup of coffee with friends.  They make their own food and pastries here every day as well. Try their brioche!"}
{"text":"First visit today. Excellent brewed coffee. Clean with plenty of seating. Prices are very good. The four stars are for the coffee. The bad news: the few food items are not so good. I tried a turkey and cheese brioche. They do not offer to warm them for you, instead you are handed a cold meat and cheese brioche, when you ask you are directed to a microwave out in the dining area. If you warm it for the recommended time it is scalding hot on the outside (I actually burned my mouth) and still frozen on the inside. I would only give the food a one star. I will stop by for coffee to go in the future, but will skip any of the food options."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Honey Vanilla Latte is amazing. I love that they don't have wifi and encourage people to talk to each other. Very cute and charming and a nice change from the other coffee places."}
{"text":"I woke up late one morning & did not have a chance to eat breakfast so my husband swung by my office & gave me a scone to eat. It was the best scone I have ever had, so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's. I had to go and check it out myself. I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet, but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone.  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes, which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work. Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered. I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised. They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places), but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go. But the coffee was not even the best part. They had 2 different kinds of scones today; Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange. So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish! Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect. The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee. The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch! Great little place to stop in the morning. This was the perfect start to my Friday! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Steve's has been in my neighborhood for years and I've only stopped in twice and that's when I'm getting my nails done.  I want to slap my own forehead for not coming more hereoften. \"smack!\" After my latest mani/pedi I was in need of a java jolt. I ducked into Steve's and ordered a medium ice coffee. Service was quick (it was a slow time in the later afternoon) and the barista friendly. I added a little milk to my drink and man-o-man was it perfect. Smooth and rich and what can I say...perfecto!   The atmosphere was so nice and calming with wooden seating that I decided to plop down for a while instead of heading home. I read my new book and sipped my caffeine and totally relaxed. I could have stayed longer and probably should have to take advantage. Instead, I'll come back more often and enjoy my neighborhood coffee bar."}
{"text":"Was visiting my bro and stopped here to have some local coffee. Loved their Vanilla Latte, regular Latte and Chai. They take time to make their drinks and I loved how VA described the latte as non sugary. I found that same taste in the coffees here.  Looks like this place has more to offer- brunch and alcohol so maybe a nice cozy place to hangout..Will need to checkout on my next visit.."}
{"text":"I've visited Steve's espresso once, but the cute bistro made the best Dirty Chai I've had in a long time!!!  The atmosphere of the place is great and cozy, and the drink selection looks amazing! Next time I go I'm gonna try the Aztec Gold(or something like that) a chocolate spicy mocha that looked delectable!!  They're kinda in the corner of a cheesy strip but worth the drive for a good priced coffee drink!"}
{"text":"While I was enjoying all the coffee shops in Phoenix, everyone needs to find a good coffee shop near their house for those days you are in a time crunch or feeling a little grouchy. In Tempe, Starbucks seems to reign and while I like Xtreme Bean's coffee, the ambiance still feels a bit corporate. While checking out New Time's Best of, I got an idea for Tempe. Behold, the winner of best new coffee shop in Tempe for 2005-Steve's! I loved the fact they do french press coffee instead of drip, my prefered method as well.  Tucked into a corner of a strip mall (of course) of McClintock and Baseline, there was ample parking. There were some guys chilling out at the steel tables with umbrellas outside the cafe, smoking and reading books. Indoors, the rust orange colour was pretty soothing as were the wooden floors. Some small tables and chairs and lounging furniture scattered around the front of the cafe. Great artwork on the walls. The counter was inviting and had a lot of good looking, fresh pastries. The owners were there, chilling out and training a new barista and recommended the American iced decaf since they didn't have decaf iced coffee. It was delicious with soy and it cost under 2 bucks and it was a pretty big sized cup! I found this place to be one of the friendliest, cleanest coffee shops and I liked the magazine and newspaper selection. I went outside to enjoy my coffee, even though it had a view of the parking lot (I am getting used to this aspect of Arizona life) at one of the tables. I can see how this shop slipped under radars due to location, but really worth a try if around the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good tea, nice seating--music can be kind of loud though.   I really like their Buckingham Palace tea, with bergamot (Earl Grey flavoring) and jasmine. However, their pot of tea is the smaller than a large, but costs more. I forget this every time I get it, but maybe they're supposed to refill it or something ...   The prices are pretty reasonable in general, like 2.50 for a cappuccino/latte.   I like the seating, tables, comfy chairs, usually I can get my pick. Also, can't beat the free wi-fi! A good place to study/meet/or just get a good drink. The baristas are really nice too.  Oooo and they have good pastries mmmmmm"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place.  We live in the area and are happy to have a locally owned place to grab a coffee and snack (I LOVE the bacon & jalapeno frittatta and the chocolate chip scone).  Their iced soy caramel latte is much better than any soy drink at Starbucks or Coffee Bean and very fairly priced.  There are always a handful of people there when we stop in but never crazy busy...which means we never have to wait long to get our fix :)"}
{"text":"Took me a bit to find as it's just south of baseline facing McClintock (even though the address is baseline). Look for a big sign that says \"COFFEE\" and not so much \"Steve's Espresso\" :)  Small place, Good coffee, and a cool tea selection. I definitely will return to sample some of those teas."}
{"text":"On my most recent visit, I chatted with the owner about two disappointing trends I've noticed at Steve's.  A few years ago, you could count on a neat little plug strip next to each table.  In addition to good coffee, glorious muffins, and burbling chilled-out house music, you could find at Steve's a good place to get your work done.  The Wi-Fi has always been spotty, but a lot of the good tables have been replaced with little cocktail tables and, worse yet, those ubiquitous plug strips are gone.  Steve explained that he's tired of people buying his coffee and studying, thereby taking up space in his store.  So in order to make more money, he's getting rid of the plugs and plans to get rid of the free wifi in the next few years.   He seemed to think this would not be a problem; I think he underestimates how many people require wifi to do their work and how little most folks care about gourmet-level coffee if it comes without a good place to do work."}
{"text":"A nice place to meet without Internet and distractions. Great tasting chai tea and coffee. They also offer a variety of brunch type foods and pastry. The service is always good."}
{"text":"This coffee house ROCKS! The staff is incredibly kind, the fresh baked goods are fantastic, and the coffee... Well it's incredible.  They use a french press to prepare coffee and it makes for an incredible brew!  The atmosphere is great with awesome music!!!!  In general, this place is a definite two thumbs up! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"THIS is what real coffee tastes like!!  As someone who has fallen victim to waking up for work at the very last minute and grabbing starbucks from near my work I must say that when I come here it makes me want to turn my life around and become a morning person!!!  This coffee is to DIE FOR.  I always get the iced mocha which is absolutely decadent. And if we must use fancy words then I need an even better one for the chocolate chip scones (Delectable?  Mouthwatering? Heavenly?) WOW!!  They are sweet, buttery, and \"melt in your mouth\" good!   If you live in Tempe, love coffee, and haven't been here then you best get your butt there because its AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the brioche ham and cheese does taste like brioche !!! The coco mocha was to die for. A very nice and laid back atmosphere all around. A great local coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Honey vanilla latte. Breakfast brioche. I get the same 2 things here, and am never disappointed. You can warm up your food at the microwave by the door.   I usually take my goods and head next door to Sunset Nails to get my nails did  (so convenient!) while I enjoy my delightful beverage and breakfast, so I can't speak for the amenities of the cafe itself. I can say that the staff and baristas here are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The problem with North Tempe is it's dominated by large chain restaurants and Starbucks. Steve's Espresso breaks the mold and is the boutique coffee shop and lounge I've been looking for. They have the best coffee, tea, and fresh made pastries in all of Tempe. It's in an unassuming location and you've probably driven passed it a thousand times and didn't even know it was there. Make a point to stop by and I promise you wont be disappointed. My favorite is a Mocha with Almond Milk, no whip, and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. So good."}
{"text":"Only been here once on our visit to AZ, but two out two of our drinks (chai tea and Carmel macchiato) were pretty dang good.  Service was fast and nice.   Would go back if i were ever here again."}
{"text":"Who am I kidding - I'm addicted to this place.  No wifi and occasional bad service be damned, the espresso is the highest quality I've had so far in Arizona.  That alone deserves 5 stars.  Also, the fall drinks are great."}
{"text":"Thanks to all of you yelpers before me who wrote such great reviews about Steve's Espresso... and thanks to Alicia B. who suggested we have a bookclub meeting here too.  Otherwise, I never would've ventured out to McClintock and Baseline in Tempe.  Not sure what else I can say other than what a great find this is... I can't speak to the coffee, but the iced tea was refreshing on a beautiful afternoon like today.  It was clean, unassuming, although there were a good amount of people there, it was quiet enough to concentrate if you needed to get work done...  there was a good energy in the air!  Drew was working the counter and was friendly - both in the store and when I called to make sure they were dog friendly (which they are if the dog stays outside).  I didn't check out the restrooms which is surprising, but I'll have to do that next visit!  I'll also have to try some of the scrumptious looking snacks... Since they are open until 10pm every night of the week, maybe I'll go hang one evening soon!  Like Alicia, I only wish it were closer to my work/home.  Do you hear that Steve?  How about a 2nd location?"}
{"text":"Decent place, and nice selection.  Food is pretty good, but a bit pricey.  They do use Barnies Coffee & Tea, so that is a plus.  I would give 4 stars if things were cheaper."}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious! Nice, quiet place to go to catch up with a friend. Too bad they don't have wi-fi. And there food selection is limited."}
{"text":"I had a few hours of work to do before dinner so I came in here. The owners decided that the internet ruins conversation and killed internet access so people could talk more and communicate with each other.  Though I think that was an interesting move, it may just be a killer because so many people depend on coffee shops for that quiet time to get work done.  The iced mocha itself wasnt bad but the lack of internet killed it for me."}
{"text":"Friend was headed to Steve's Espresso before heading into work, now I have given up drinking coffee at the beginning of the year, so I can't give a testament to how great the coffee taste (yes Starbucks has been calling because they do notice how much I used to spend their) but I asked my friend to pick me up something sweet, she brought me 2 chocolate chip scones!   Let me tell you they were delish! I was doing paperwork while eating my scones, and keep thinking man this is good stuff, the chocolate chips were nice & firm and the scone was sweet and moist, sometimes I have had scones that where dry and in need of coffee or tea to help finish them down! But these scones are top notch!   I was rather sad :( when I noticed they were all gone, did I really just eat both of them!! Dang it!!! Have to go back and get more!!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to coffee shop for about ten years if my memory is correct.  Its local. I love that.  Its in my hood. I really love that.    There will be days when I have a thirty minute break and I am ten minutes away and ill drive out of my way for my Steve's fix.  The convenience Steve's Espresso being in my neighborhood is just one of the reasons I go there.  They have great tasting coffee.   There Cappuccinos are spot on.  My regular drink is the Red Eye with vanilla which has enough caffeine to keep me hyped up all more.  There vanilla lattes are amazing.  As for there food I haven't  tried everything I am kind of a creature of habit.  But I can recommend the greek frittata, the breakfast brioche, and there chocolate chip scones.    Long live Steves Espresso."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype here. The interior decorating is great but the coffee is average at best. The French press coffee wasn't exciting, but it wasn't bad. The flavored espresso drinks are just terrible. They are so sweet and the syrup quality is bad. I want a real caramel drizzle if I'm paying for it."}
{"text":"Great Tempe coffee shop! Beats Starbucks everyday. Better prices and the food is made fresh. The scones are really good! I just wish they had a drive thru"}
{"text":"Awesome little place. Freshly brewed coffee and tons of teas. Really friendly service too. I hope to see the atmosphere spiced up a little more (ie paintings, photos, or any other sort of art)."}
{"text":"Great place to relax, grab a nice cup of coffee, brioche, or a frittata.  Recently remodeled with a modern decor and open bench seating it has that hip vibe of a local place that hugs the coffee bean trees while they are still growing.  Apparently they now serve beer, wine & coctails so geared up to cater to the evening crowd  (unless that's your morning thing to).  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my experience this morning at Steve's Espresso. I walked in excited to have a slice of their delicious quiche when I saw that they have a new menu. I was totally into the new menu, they have breakfast tacos (YUM)! My boyfriend ordered the breakfast tacos and I got the breakfast wrap. Unfortunately when my boyfriend got his cold brew he ordered, there was so much ice in his drink he was able to finish it in three sips. They brought out our food and messed up my order so we had to send it back. When they came back with my wrap, the cheese wasn't melted, the tortilla was cold, and there was so much aioli on the wrap that the whole thing tasted like mayonnaise. I use to love this place do to the shop being walking distance from my home, but I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Ended up here last Monday after we found Solo Cafe was closed, but I'm glad we did. I tried the Aztec Mocha, a Europa, and a breakfast brioche.  The microwave to warm up your brioche or other pastries is at the cream bar so you can do it yourself. I actually like that because some places can't/won't heat stuff up or make it too hot/cold.  The brioche was light and fluffy though wasn't as filled as I would have liked. It was a really nice morning snack than the usual bars and pastries. Definitely give them a try. The coffees were really good but a little cooler than I usually prefer, though it was okay to be able to drink right away without having to scald myself. I preferred the Aztec over the Europa but I'm glad I ordered both.  Nice little local coffee place hidden in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I live right between here and Solo Cafe (another nearby coffee shop). I always end up going to Steve's when I need to get work done. They've got bigger tables and a generally more mature clientele. They also play some good music, which unlike Solo, is relaxing and easy to work to.  And not to mention the coffee... it's the best in town. They french press every cup, which I love. The refills are cheap, unlike Solo. I haven't tried the food, but it looks great and always tempts me."}
{"text":"One of our favorite coffee places!  If I go to get some work done I do have to bring my own internet but the coffee and food totally make up for that.  If you're there with friends it's a place that encourages you to actually talk to each other!!"}
{"text":"Come to Steve's to visit with someone special. Get brioche and coffee. Try the Aztec or Honey and Vanilla, both are amazing. Service was friendly and quick. The coffee shop was clean and everything was easily accessible.  I highly recommend you add this place to your travels when you are out and about and want some coffee!"}
{"text":"First time here and the coffee is excellent.  Clean sitting area... Warning no WiFi.  But it's definitely a chill relaxing place.  I didn't try the food, but everyone else's looked good.  The server actually came out to various tables to check on people, I've never seen that in a coffee shop.  I will probably come back.  The low prices and great coffee outweigh my desire for free WiFi."}
{"text":"I used to hang here all the time. Two things made me stop.... And no it wasn't the lack of internet. First they started pushing harder and harder to become a reastraunt. When they began making egg based dishes the smell in the tiny area left my stomach naucious and my clothes smelling. Secondly Steve himself. His ego and attitude that he is to be worshipped, never questioned and frankly you should feel grateful to be allowed in his shop.... Well it got old. I LOVE giving local shops my money when I can. But if the owner does not respect his customer.... Well my dollar goes to the giant Green Machine I am sorry to say."}
{"text":"I started liking this place after I tried the iced Aztec Mocha.  Strong and delicious with a taste of mexican chocolate and cinnamon.  I've tried hot coffee and it's smooth.  Tried the iced chai latte and it needed sugar, I guess I was expecting something closer to the Starbucks, like really sweet.....  Have had their bacon/jalapeno frittata and it's sooo good.  Not at all spicy like I thought, but definetely a taste of chile with some chunks of potatoe and chunks of cheese.  Never mind my sweet tooth, I enjoy supporting this local place.  The barista is always so nice and quick!  Haven't tried the teas because I'm intimated by all the different selections.  I agree with another post, the sign does remind me of FreddyKruger too!! :)  Sometimes I worry their location doesn't give them enough justice to how great this little place is."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Stop in and you will not be disappointed. Local fresh roasted coffee with much better coffee, food and friendly service than the large chains. Nothing like the combined smell of fresh coffee and fresh goods baking in the shop - great way to wake up."}
{"text":"Steve's Espresso was recommended to me by a friend one day as I was on my way to work before Solo Cafe opened and desperate for some heavenly caffeine. When they told me where it was I almost didn't believe them, as I drive past it every day and never knew it was there. It's pretty hidden and the main sign doesn't have the name of the business but just says coffee I believe.   The coffee is pretty good. I have come to love the aztec mocha. I also appreciate that the cups are already insulated thus eliminating the need for the crazy cup holder/warmer thing that doesn't really work at all and keeps falling down.  The atmosphere is fairly plain. I believe they have free wifi, but to me it feels like just another establishment I'd stop in quickly but not be inclined to stay at. I'd love to see a more inviting feel. I'd probably stay and have more coffee instead of getting mine to go."}
{"text":"Steve's is in my Baseline & Guadalupe neighborhood, and I have come to rely on their ultra smooth french press coffee.  A mellow coffeehouse that isn't packed with hipsters who stand around outside smoking.   Wonderful place for actually reading.  A great independent Tempe business...  don't go to Starbucks in Tempe when you have so many other choices."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Coffee is great. Love their unique menu. I see reviews on here talking about the owners \"attitude problem\"? Or the place seeming \"uptight\"? Don't know what's up those peoples a**, but the owner is great and so are the workers. I'm here nearly 3-4 days out of the week and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Quiet place; great for working . . . Unless you need Internet for your job. Then you must contend with their unbelieveably slow WIFI.   The Mexican Mocha is delish!"}
{"text":"NO wifi, average coffee at best. I dont get all the complements on this place. Was not thrilled with it at all."}
{"text":"The espresso is good. Pastries are okay. Atmosphere is uptight or maybe it was just during my visit but the owner micromanaged EVERY LITTLE THING the employees did, down to how the put whipped cream in a dome lid! Back off and chill out, dude. Geez. Oh and no wifi, which is the main reason I wont be back. The owner sat on his tablet for an hour, using wifi, but doesnt want customers to be able to do the same? I dont know if hes cheap or just egocentric, but Im out!!"}
{"text":"Steve's offers a nice variety of coffee and tea drinks, including seasonal drinks such as pumpkin spice latte. They offer both soy and almond milk as milk alternatives, for $.40 extra. Service was fast and friendly, and the drink I had (Iced pumpkin spice latte with almond milk) was pretty good. I'll definitely frequent Steve's again for their caffeinated drinks and their option to add almond milk instead of soy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Steve and his employees are super friendly and they make the best chai latte in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"No wifi but it's great if you know you're easily distracted online. Studied here for finals and read everything out my books. Coffee is delicious and so are the breakfast brioches(incase you skipped breakfast). The price is great. Definitely coming back again and definitely going to recommend."}
{"text":"French press is fantastic.  House-made, from-scratch baked brioche is great.  No Wi-Fi, thus, great for reading and/or talking.  Hardly ever crowded.  Cleanest bathroom I have seen in a Tempe coffee house."}
{"text":"This place started to be cool, but I didn't appreciate not being told BEFOREHAND about the wifi not being in service. Being a student I frequent coffee shops to not only indulge in my coffee obsession but to be able to peruse the World Wide Web so I may conduct research while I study, and after I placed my order and took my seat to get down to business, much to my dismay, the wifi was not connecting, so I asked the barista who then told me sorry but the wifi was out of service and didn't know when it would be up and running again. BAD customer service! I get you still want to make money and conduct your business, but you should be honest and give people the choice if they want to patronize you if you do not have certain in demand services available. The coffee was good and bran muffin was very tasty, and I love the 50 cent refill option, but I'm deducting starts for the lack of communication about the Internet."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, I got an iced coffee and it was pretty delicious. It was strong but very low in acidity, which is always the way I prefer an iced coffee. I also ordered the veggie frittata and took it to go. I was really impressed with the frittata, it was light and fluffy and the veggies were crisp even after I reheated it.   I try to support local whenever I can and I am really happy my friend suggested this place instead of Starbucks. Fast and Fresh and Free Wi Fi!"}
{"text":"Thought for a brief second I had found my new local coffee spot. Lots of drink choices . decent food menu and even serves beer and liquor ... Has comfy couches and cool seating options.... But no Wi-Fi? This explains why at a time when other coffee shops are super busy this place only had 1 person in it. You can not run a shoo like this without Wi-Fi and frankly its sends the wrong signal to would be customers ."}
{"text":"If you like it dirty, their dirty chai is da bomb. Didn't hang around long (because the service was so speedy) but it looked pretty chill. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"By far the best Americano I have ever had. The dried tomato brioche was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally found this place!  Tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car dealerships, its a great little find.  I noticed that they have great hours here, open early and late at night as well.  The seating here is great.  Could accomidate a group as long as its not super busy, and they seem to have a decent menu of sorts.  I really like this place, and the guy at the counter who helped me was nice and funny.  Worth a stop to grab some coffee, read the paper, or surf the internet."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to get some work done, catch with friends, read your book, or just hang out!  I love this place. I am addicted to their cranberry-orange scone... it's just perfect size, taste, texture... yumm... and of course, the coffee is excellent and price is just right!  Thank you, Steve!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! ...Let's start there. Nice calm ambience with nice music playing in the background. Like the location being in a obscure, around the corner spot in a little strip mall. Simple tasty breakfast items (breakfast croissant) and killer fresh baked blueberry muffins. A must stop if you live in Tempe and worth the drive if you dont."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the valley!! And the pastries a-mazing."}
{"text":"Steve's has been a regular stop for me, with some of the better coffee I've had in the valley. I've seen and heard a few people complain about the lack of WiFi, but its honestly one of the biggest reasons I keep going back.... it lets me pull out my laptop and focus in on what I need to get done.   The food is generally tasty... I've never had something I disliked. The cocktails, should you be inclined, are ok. I tend to think something is missing from them, but I can't quite figure out what it is.  Overall though I definitely recommend Steve's. Staff is friendly and if you go there frequently they will remember you."}
{"text":"My first time at Steve's Espresso.  I love Steve's!  Cool & funky atmosphere.  Funky music.  Good prices.  Funky barista.  What isn't improved if you rub a little funk on it?    I had a ham & cheese brioche with my iced decaf.  Surprisingly good!  The filling was nice and not scrimpy.  The pastry pocket was flaky and delicious with a nice rosemary flavor.  Good light lunch!  Can you say free wifi?"}
{"text":"I went here one day last year cuz the SBs drive through line was to long. I got a red  eye and it was the absolute best coffee drink I have ever had!!!!! I moved to Chandler but still prefer steves over any cup in town....."}
{"text":"Working from home and felt like a breakfast burrito this morning.  Not a lot of quick, nearby choices so I was headed towards Jack when I decided I wanted espresso too this morning.  I got so lucky in that, forget about Jack I found out Steve's has breakfast food!  I've been to Steve's Espresso quite a few times since its nearby and their coffee and espresso drinks are fantastic.  My favorite is chi tea with a shot of espresso and soy milk prepared warm (not hot) so I can drink it immediately without scalding my tongue.  Lots of coffee shops offer similar, but Steve's tastes better and the staff actually know how to follow directions and produce a perfect, warm cup every time.  I'm not typically a morning person so this was my first trip to Steve';s in the morning (but won't be my last).  My chi only took a couple minutes for them to make, but while waiting I noticed a large display case with a little sign that read \"Everything in this case made here, from scratch daily\".  Contained within were a large variety of french breakfast pastries such as brioche.  I asked for a bacon, egg & cheese brioche and was told they had just come out of the oven.  A moment later I was holding a light, warm and fluffy pastry that is one of the best I've ever had.  Forget Jack for breakfast burritos, Steve's is a vastly better choice (and it was less than $3 too!!!!)."}
{"text":"I've had a mocha there before and it was good, as well as bought some loose leaf tea as a gift for a friend. That's not what the 2-star rating is about though.   My 2 stars are for the fact I stood in line, looked at the menu, and was about to order when I finally saw the (small) sign about no WiFi. Not only was it irritating that I stood and waited in line, it was even more frustrating to realize that I had almost ordered without discovering that first since I was going to try to get some work done.   Only reason I'd even stopped in was to try to support another local coffee shop (I had already been to GoldBar earlier that day and enjoyed a tasty mocha, PLUS free WiFi)."}
{"text":"I only drink straight expresso and this is the best I have had yet low acidity lots of creme great flavor and consistently great depending on who is making it"}
{"text":"Iced latte and chocolate chip scone were both great!"}
{"text":"Our go-to local coffee shop. You know those times when all you really want is to sit down for a bit with a friend and have them focus on the conversation without getting distracted by their electronic devices? Steve's is the place for that. They've been wi-do free for a few years and it's great. This is my place to study distraction free.   Service: Like most coffee shops, self serve. The baristas usually have a smile for you and often greet customers by name.   Food and Drink: black coffee is tasty, I think they brew it using a French press method instead of a paper drip filter. I could be off on that though. Italian sodas with cream are always a favourite too.   Their food is dangerous. Sometimes I come I just wanting a coffee. And then the staff start baking, and the smells waft over to my table. And then I'm eating something I didn't even know I wanted.   Breakfast brioches and quiches are super tasty too! Steve has really revamped the cafe in the last year or so, making it more than just a place to grab coffee.   Ambiance: it's good for groups, couples, singles. It's good for reading, chatting, and people watching. Sometimes the music gets too loud to concentrate, but that's the only complaint I have.   I've been here so many times since I moved to Tempe, and I'll probably continue until I move out of state."}
{"text":"Great coffee, food and atmosphere. I've been coming here for years, and it's consistently my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sorry Steve! I feel kind of guilty, but I have come here two or three times in the last couple of weeks due to it's somewhat close proximity to my living area..... each time has been worse and worse. I still haven't tried the food, which still looks super good! I did, however, try some different coffee drinks. I tried the mocha coconut iced and the aztec mocha iced. Both were appalling. I could not finish either. The coconut tasted WAY too sweet and a little chemical -ish. The Aztec was okay at first.... but slowly became cloyingly sweet as well.... maybe it's the chocolate they use? It was totally unpleasant. The Barista's have always been nice enough, and the space is nice, but man. The coffee just isn't there....."}
{"text":"Nice, little spot we stopped in today after having lunch at Pasand. The employee was very friendly and decor was standard of a coffee shop. Despite being full from Indian buffet, I can't help but try baked goods in a new spot. For me, this was a soft-baked Snickerdoodle, that was good. I also had a small, non-fat pumpkin latte (yes, non-fat with the cookie!) that was equally enjoyable. For a total of 2 cookies, a juice box, latte, double espresso, and small italian soda, it came out to a little over $10. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Breakfast brioche, the best thing since sliced bread Steves is the best local coffee joint around!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious. Friendly. Inviting. Warm decor and soothing music. This is the first local coffee house I found when i moved here a year ago. It was an oasis, a hidden gem in a shopping plaza. My only complaint is that there's nothing else around worth doing, so you can't grab an ice chai (my favorite; with 1 shot espresso), a conversation and hit the road. You either have you chill in one of their comfortable chairs or sit outside on the make-shift patio. Works for me, unless you get antsy.   Bonus - Free Wifi. And the people there are no way obnoxious. No loud conversations or annoying cell phone calls.   If you like tea, you can buy some here. They boast a wide selection that even the most decisive tea drinker may have trouble deciding!  MONKS BLEND = Oh so good!  I only wish it were closer to my work/home.  And for you carb lovers, try the Pumpkin Muffin. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Have had fairly good espresso here, including ristretto upon request.  Good local place that isn't too pretentious, and yet also has quality coffee and espresso.  Prices reasonable.  Parking decent during the day."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I like this place! Great coffee, great service, and AWESOME PEANUTBUTTER COOKIES....mmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!  I love that they have a ton of loose teas to choose from, and their coffee is smooth and delish as well (coffee is ALWAYS better made in a french press!). The barista told me they get some of their teas from their roaster and from tealux (have to research that one) They offer soy and almond milk options, for us anti-dairy folk. They have housemade cookies and pastries and fritatas. They only thing, with the fritatas, you have to reheat them yourself in a microwave (personally, I prefre made-to-order food).  I don't know if it's true with all the cookies, but at least I know the peanutbutter cookie is gluten and dairy free, though not vegan (contains eggs). Great service.....the barista even texted his boss for me to verify what ingredients are used in the cookies. Nice guy!  Great coffee shop for the area! I'm a fan :)"}
