{"text":"Wow, I can't stop going to this place!  I have to get on here and comment on a couple of new menu items I've tried.  Recently tried the Adobada and the Carnitas burritos - both were fantastic.  Pork and guacamole is always a great combo.  And the Steak and Chorizo Burrito is the stuff of legends.  No joke - this thing is amazing!  It's pretty much all meat with a red chile-type sauce."}
{"text":"I really feel the  need to write this review. My husband and I have been going here for 4 yrs. We   ate there once a week. We ordered our usual Im allergic to tomatoes My husband told them no tomatoes on my burrito. I pulled open a little piece of it, tomatoes. No big deal my husband got up told the owner of the mistake he said  in a very rude way no you didnt say no tomatoes!! My husband said yes I did he again corrected my husband. I didnt even take a bite out of it. He didnt offer to make me a new one. All he wanted was to be right. My husband threw out his and my lunch and we left. Never will we be back again. Hope it was worth losing loyal customers."}
{"text":"I went to this place and had the carne asada burrito people seem to really like and I have to say the place and the burrito wasn't bad. It was close to home, cheap, and a good place to get a quick fix. I liked it well enough and the food was a good portion size for the price. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I went the there yesterday and order  a California  burrito and it had lots of pico de Guyo with  some potatoes  and very  little  of carne asada  in the burrito and when I called  to let  them know all what they said is so what do you want me do do about it"}
{"text":"California Burrito add guacamole. This place is one of the better \"fast food\" mexican food joints in town. Way better than the filibertos type places. Drive thru and all."}
{"text":"Huge tasty ham egg pico & cheese breakfast burrito for $4. Fast and pleasant service.  Sold."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito has the best tasting chorizo burrito that I've had anywhere - and for a price that is unmatched - $4.75 including tax.  We need a location in Mesa - please. :-)"}
{"text":"Always do the drive through when in a hurry to grab a carne asada burrito and go. Ask for extra limes. Huge burrito so I usually split it!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the best kept secret burrito/Mexican dive in south Scottsdale. Great fast mexi food cheap! Now they keep raising prices and the food has become inconsistent.  I noticed that they flat-grill the Carne and put it in a kitchen bucket and then keep the bucket on the flat grill to keep it warm. If your burrito is made from the meat on top half of the batch it is good. If your meat come from the bottom it is soaked in grease and discusting. Hope they can come up with a better syatem. Until then you'll have a 50/50 chance of a good buro."}
{"text":"Good food bad customer service. Food is what I expect from a drive thru Mexican food place, but definitely not the best of its kind (Los favoritos). Drive thru people seem to not care about you at all. Also the potatoes in the California carne asada burritos differ depending on what time you go there."}
{"text":"Es uno de mis lugares favoritos ,cuando quiero tacos roles ,no puedo ir a otro lugar ,aqui hacen unos tacos roles delisiosos y no se hable de los demas platillos"}
{"text":"I wanted something different from my original lunch meal. So, on my lunch break I drove by this place. I pulled in and \"California\"  It was an good burrito, it taste almost the same burrito served at Filibertos."}
{"text":"They are awesome. I love the food, the people are friendly, service is quick, and the food is relatively cheap for how much they give you. I go there whenever I can and never regret it. I'm only doing 4 stars because they have messed up one or two orders of mine in the past but not nearly enough to make me stop going. :)"}
{"text":"It was \"ok\" nuthin special but maybe i came at a wrong time...very quick service && alot for your monies!"}
{"text":"We ordered three of the $2.30 tacos - fish, carne asada, and adobada and a side of rice.  Food came fast and piping hot.  Carne asada and adobada were topped with guac and salsa, while the fish reminded us of good fish sticks with shredded iceberg and Miracle Whip.  Carne asada was a tad dry but the adobada was full of flavor.  Rice was insanely salty which made us down a huge cup of Horchata.

We ate inside which was pleasant and clean.  They're open 24-hours - a great late night alternative to burgers from other nearby fast food joints."}
{"text":"Just had a carne asada burrito. It was ready in about a minute and was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burrito place in south Scottsdale. The prices and portions are good, the food is delicious, and the salsas are great. Last time we were there, we ordered a customized vegetarian burrito and an adobada burrito. We were both very satisfied with our food."}
{"text":"Everyone else pretty much summed it up for me: Fiesta Burrito IS def good-------especially for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent price, service and food.  I'm not sure about some of the low reviews here.  I rarely review any place but this is a little gem that deserves to be noticed.  I have had 2 different types of the breakfast burrito and the shredded beef chimichanga. and have enjoyed every last bite.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito's are pretty much my favorite food in the whole world. Fiesta's Country Burrito definitely contributes to this. Fresh tortilla, eggs, potatoes, cheese - add refried beans and their amazing green salsa... it's a beautiful thing, really.   Plus they have the best Dr Pepper ever, the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup. 

It's also friendly, cheap, fast and a three minute drive from my house. LOVE"}
{"text":"I love love love the California burrito! It's amazing. Don't like the wait. You get a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here on average once a week.  We have our favorite menu items and they never disappoint.  Consistently delicious.   Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"So dissapointed with this place, I usually go in the morning never had a problem,  I rarely go in the afternoon; there is this fat guy (very rude)and this girl that thinks she is doing ME a favor, I place my order and last time I checked the country burrito did not included EGG SHELLS;  so I had to throw away my burrito, food is great service is awful"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars purely for the Carne Asada burrito. it's so good!!! I've tried other items on the menu and was not impressed. The shredded chicken was greasy and just stuffed with too much cheese, and I couldn't even finish it. They also have a horrible drive thru. You have no idea what they are saying. I orderedsome rolled tacos with no cheese only guac, and they gave me rolled tacos with cheese and no gauc. I was so angry. I love guac! So check your food before leaving if going thru the drive thru."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty and way better than the other little \"- - - - bertos\" Mexican restaurants, the prices are awesome and the service is always super friendly. If you're in the area swing by and snag yourself a California burrito."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have pointed out, it's inexpensive authentic Mexican food. It's good stuff, the service is fast and polite and the restaurant is consistently clean - which is to say, all contributing factors to why I eat lunch there every workday.

My only complaint is that there isn't a vegetarian burrito on the menu - but the staff is more than accommodating if you ask for a specific dish."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when the food was good, so it's disappointing to have to write a bad review about it. The customer service has always been bad, but I was able to overlook that when I enjoyed the food. Now, however, the food quality has gone down drastically. They used to have the best green salsa that I would always get to go with the burritos. They must have changed that recipe...one part salsa with 3 parts water? Its awful!! Their rolled tacos are pretty much taquitos that you buy at the grocery store in the frozen foods. 

The customer service is nonexistent! I always go through the drive-thru and every time I order and all they say is \"Thank You\"...no \"pull around\", no total, no repeating of the order for any mistakes. It's extremely awkward!! Then when you actually encounter humans the awkwardness increases tenfold when there is still no talking except to ask if you want the watery salsa, and to tell you the price (which changes EVERY TIME you go there, even if its twice in two days!). Fiesta I used to brag about you to all my friends, now I think the only person I would tell is my worst enemy so I could laugh about the awkwardness they will go through interacting with your restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome. Perfect example of the fine art of making excellent food from clean, fresh ingredients. Burrito, enchiladas, chimichanga....all exceptionally good. 10/10 would eat my next meal there."}
{"text":"This place make look dirty outside but it is one of the cleanliness  and great place to eat. Great portions and very awesome service both drive up or walk in and relax great prices and good tastes delicious and workers are always friendly. I go their often and always consistent on all orders."}
{"text":"Been going to Fiesta for 3 years now.  Killer carne Asada burrito, super supreme nachos, and chimi!  They could use a better acronym for the nachos on the receipt though...\"sprm nachos\" don't quite sound as delicious.."}
{"text":"I've been trying various cheap mexican food \"stands\" in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in San Diego.  Fiesta Burrito is the best I've found in the valley.  (note: Los Favoritos is up there with it)

I've had mostly burritos and rolled tacos, but I've really liked them.  Carne Asada, bean-and-cheese, and breakfast burritos have all been very solid.  I like the rolled tacos, as well.

My companion on a recent visit ordered the \"rolled tacos supreme\" (where they pile carne asada and other stuff on top of 5 rolled tacos).  Wow, I'd never noticed that before...can I try one?  In a word, awesome.  Not very practical to eat, but really yummy.

Although I expect (and accept) a little tummy-turning after a meal at a place like this, I've never had even the slightest grumble after eating at Fiesta.

It's cheap and they DO accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Amazing late night mexican food!  Me and a couple of buddies would hit this place almost every night on our way home from the casino.  They got to know us and knew what we ordered.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though. It's a favorite of the 20 something crowd heading back to tempe after a long night of bad decisions up in scottsdale, at least they finished strong."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish burrito through Foodora after reading rave reviews but was very disappointed with the food. There was way too much rice in the burrito and it was very dry and not flavourful at all. Also tried the chip and guacamole which tasted like store bought Tostitos and pre-made guac. Will not try this place again."}
{"text":"The food is good and the prices are good.

The food always seems to be a lot less greasy then those *beto places. Love it!

Carnitas burrito for me every time."}
{"text":"When I first drove past this place I wasn't too sure about it. I looked it up on Yelp and I saw that it had pretty good reviews, so I decided to try it out. I love it! I usually get the California Burrito and a medium drink which comes out to about $5.60. The burrito is a decent size too. Totally recommend this place if your in the mood for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"By far the best cheap carne asada burrito around. Big, tasty & filled with guacamole!  Definetly a stop on the way ho
e from Oldtown."}
{"text":"Amazing! Just happened to be driving down McDowell looking for a delicious post-night of drinking breakfast. I got the machaca breakfast burrito and it was out of this world! I'll be going back again soon to try more. Definitely legit place"}
{"text":"Addictive and Amazing! My boyfriend loves hole-in-the-wall places that scare me. So I looked on yelp for places one day so I could find him a well reviewed one. The rest was history. My boyfriend lived in LA for 10 years (known for excellent food) and he is living there temporarily right now. He says the carne asada burrito is the best he has ever had anywhere. One day he flew back home and when I picked him up from the airport at 10pm he asked to go to Fiesta Burrito. The last time he came back he drove from LA and stopped at Fiesta before even coming to see me and I only see him two weekends per month!

I don't eat beef so my favorite is the adobada burrito. They also have the best refried beans I have had in many years. 

Be careful if you go - because you will want to go back again and again. I liked the guys review about running the marathon and wanting to stop. My boyfriend would have been right there with you!!!"}
{"text":"If you want good quality mexican fast food at a low price this is the place for you. I especially love their breakfast burritos, they are amazing! My two favorites are the Country burrito and the steak egg and cheese burrito. The carne asada nachos are also very good. The salsa bar is great also. I highly recommend this place! Trust me im Mexican :)"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Being from L.A. felt like I  was in my old neighborhood of East L.A."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Just dropped in, very tasty. Had rolled tacos with guacamole."}
{"text":"This place is just Okay. It's close to my house so I've eaten here quite a few times. The best items I've had are the breakfast burritos, they actually are pretty good and available all day.

My biggest issue with this place is the meat. When you order something with meat on it, they do put a lot on there but, its just not that good. The chicken is always tough, stringy and chewy. The carnitas is an odd consistency, more like chipped beef, not like the shredded/pulled pork consistency it should be and its very greasy. The carne asada is tough but the best meat option (besides the bacon) in my opinion.

The pico de gallo is mostly cilantro, way too much for my tastes but if you like cilantro you'll love their pico."}
{"text":"slightly better then most mexican joints, fresher too. Only wish it was open later. be sure to tip them =D."}
{"text":"Awesome fast-food Mexican.  Great service in the drive-thru.  Convenient location.

Nothing else matters"}
{"text":"Sub Par at best, Carne Asada plate two bland pieces of steak, tough and you have to chop it up yourself, the rice is bleh. I live down the street and I thought I would give this place a second chance due to construction on McDowell Rd, I'll continue going to LosBetos from now on. Even the photos on their drive thru menu look bland."}
{"text":"I almost lost my faith in mexican food in Arizona. All of the \"bertos\" suck and I was finding places that didn't offer carne asada.. wth? Anyways, this place makes me less homesick. Food is yummy and prices are dirt cheap. I'm a really big fan of the #18! 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice for $7.95! Just pour some pico de gallo on that burrito and it will hit the spot mmmm"}
{"text":"This place is near, and I haven't been in til recently when one of my disabled vet friends suggested we go. 
I got the adobada burrito. ABSOLUTELY YUM.
They have the traditional \"berto's\" red sauce, all you can squirt!
They also have green sauce, pico and a chunky carrot/jalapeno/thai pepper (that one is 60 cents  but the others are free).
My burrito was a shave under 4 bucks WITH TAX!
It's a deal, Bob! 
The burritos totally hit the spot!!
The chile relleno burrito is a total champ that's done properly --- get it here, NOT at Super Burrito.
Value and taste are excellent and of course the burritos are piping hot and will survive the drive home. If you do the drive through and ask for the red sauce, ask for about 4 because the containers are small. Service is very fast.
I have returned there several times since but I don't have much more to say about the place other than it's better than any-berto's."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, but if you are looking for tasteful food it's not the right place. In fact, the 2 stars represent the value per dollars of the food. 4 stars for this place is insane. AZ people - you know better Mex food!"}
{"text":"For fast cheap Mexican food this place is the best! Super nachos with machaca, fantastic! Mixed burrito, amazing! Adovada, delish! Any of the tortas, top notch! The portions are great for the price and the ingredients are good quality."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed by this place. I thought when the new owners took over from Mission Burrito they might actually up the amount of toppings you get inside your burrito. I don't eat beans so I usually just get rice when I have a burrito and I realize that they need to fill the burrito with something but I got 3 giant spoonfuls of rice. Overcooked to boot. 

A little bit of chicken. I actually watched the woman put some back when she must of figured she put down a regular human sized amount of protein onto my burrito. 
Heaven forbid! 

I mean I guess I did ONLY pay 9 dollars for it...(that was sarcasm). 9 dollars should be able to buy you a substantial meal. Considering for the same amount of money or less you can go next door to Helena's Kitchen and get a stuffed chicken breast and 3 side salads that are freshly made daily and taste delicious. 

But I digress...then I got the smallest smear of guac I have ever seen. Just the very tip of the spreader was used. The tip! Barely covered 2 inches of space and super thin. 

When they put the cheese on I could count the amount of shreds. I was a bit pissed at this point so I overcame my quiet Canadian disposition and I asked for a bit more and the woman making my burrito looked over at her manager to see if it was ok, so she put a second minuscule amount on my burrito. It's a burrito folks. Cheese is a must. 

Move onto the pico de gallo. Enough for a regular burrito but this was a large and basically the only thing containing moisture at this point. 

Then came the heaping amount of lettuce. So much lettuce!!! 

A little sour cream and voila! A rice and lettuce burrito? See pic for confirmation. That's about a quarter of the way into it. Not much in the way of anything. Just tasted like rice in the end. 

Never again. My 1 star is for the service. They're a least pleasant while ripping you off. I'm really sick of paying 9 dollars for rice and lettuce from this location. 

If you ever go there, just look at the spoons used to serve the rice as compared to the spoon for the pico. You could probably fit 15+ of the pico spoons inside of the rice spoon. 

It's ridiculous. I should be full after that much rice but I think my anger has burned off those calories already and I'm ready to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito! I love you but you forgot my sausage breakfast burrito when I went through the drive through right now.  I know, it's partly my fault but that sausage burrito is real missed right now."}
{"text":"This is place is like the average berto's type Mexcian fast food. The staff is very friendly. They also cook the food fresh which leads to a great hot meal. Location is ok and not to hard to get into. Though sometimes there is a long line in the drive through. Sometimes it also takes a while to get your food."}
{"text":"This place is a huge improvement on Mission Burrito which was here before it. The selection is much bigger, their burritos are tastier and the staff are way more friendly. A great place to grab a bite from - highly recommend the crispy chicken burrito! In case you're not familiar with Village by the Grange, there is general seating available for all the different fast food places in there."}
{"text":"Bean burritos!  Cheap and good! I eat for two days. The food is great, and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the tortilla' they use here. They are so fresh and well made I just want to create an entire bed sheet out of them and sleep with a freshly pressed and warm tortilla every night.
This place fuels our internet department mornings at least once a week...
Affordable, fast, clean and high quality."}
{"text":"Always getting the two tacos and the super nachos here... its my late night addiction haha"}
{"text":"Fiesta is definitely my favorite of the fast food Mexican places in town. I actually eat their food sober, although after a night in old town the burritos are even tastier, if that's possible. 

I usually get a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese and pico. Their carne asada is pretty good too, but it tastes more like ground beef than steak to me. I like to add rice and get a side of sour cream, and for a mere $5 they are definitely filling. 

My only gripe is that Fiesta isn't open 24/7 or offer the late night hours that some of the other -beto's do (they're open til 3am on Friday which is great, but 2am on Saturdays and 1am during the week). I work at a bar and sometimes don't get off work until 2:30 or 3am and am disappointed when Fiesta is closed \"early\"."}
{"text":"I used to worship this place like 10 years ago when I was in high school, now not so much.. I am not only offended by the food that was offered to me but the portions are small and the price is too high. I used to love getting carne Asada fries or super nachos but this time I wanted something different. I got the #7 which is two burritos with rice and beans. With that being said I was overwhelmingly disappointed.. the food was gross to say the least and the I couldn't even finish any of my burritos which were beef and chicken. The chicken had so much liquid coming from it, it was repulsive and the beef was straight up unappetizing. Not only am I mad I paid 10 dollars for this but now I'm left still hungry unable to eat the food. I don't know what happened to fiesta burrito but this is not the standards I remember after school hanging out with friends. And I don't get me started to talk about the rice and beans.. what a sorry excuse for a Mexican establishment, I will not be a customer here any more."}
{"text":"Best drive thru mexican food in scottsdale by far. Good for lunch or late night eats. All the staff are great and a fun atmosphere if you decide to sit down in the small dining area. Although small they have a good salsa bar. My favorite is the chile relleno burrito and the steak ranchero breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm originally from San Diego, CA. home of some of the best Mexican restaurants and I can honestly say this place is just as good if not better than some of them! I conveniently live across the street from them so anytime I'm craving some authentic Mexican I go here! Rolled tacos, supreme quesadilla, burritos..it's all great!"}
{"text":"I love Fiesta Burrito! I usually only get the breakfast burritos and I can't really put into words how great it is. You can get two burritos for under $10, which to me is a great deal. I love pouring on their green sauce. Definitely a top notch \"fast food\" Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I debated if I should even review this mediocre experience. The reviews make it sound like its a hidden gem, of quality and quantity in the lost art of Mexican cuisine. I found it very bland. It did fill the purpose for which I came here, but compared to some awesome Mexican food that I have had in this so-close-to-Mexico-state - this place was far from note worthy.

It's not expensive, which is the factor that saves this place - but I find the fast food angle of Mexican food incredibly tacky. And the seating arrangement is purposely very small. It is clear that the model is enter-pay-eat-gtfo, and I have no issue with that - but I don't see this as something that I want.

One could compare this to a Mexican franchise, something that in itself is a hilarious strangeness when one is living with so many actual Mexican that can cook amazing things out of mystery meat, lard, flour and chili."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for years. I love fiesta they have always been very nice. But there is a new girl employee that is very unfriendly and made me feel like I was annoying her. She seemed unhappy ti answer our simple questions. She has blomde hair and dark eyebrows."}
{"text":"If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  

Another great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior."}
{"text":"I ordered their Chicken Burrito today and all I have to say is I was less than satisfied with it. The chicken tasted like it was cooked in hotdog water. Very bland no flavor.

its too bad I love burritos"}
{"text":"I like Fiesta Burrito! The burritos, tacos, and nachos are ALL good here. The food is made fresh to order and never had an issues with eating at this Mexican food joint. I normally go for lunch and the places does get crowded during the week for lunch. There chicken supreme burrito is good if you are a chicken lover. have not tried the carne asada but my buddy did have it and really enjoyed it. He also had the pork carnitas which he also truly enjoyed. The green salsa has much more flavor than the red just an FYI."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and I love burritos . Moved to arizona about a month ago and live right next to fiesta burrito . I love California burritos and they have a good one with good red and green salsa . 

Wish the burrito was alittle thicker and the fries not as moist but other than that I will be a regular there for as long as I live here ."}
{"text":"Very good California Burrito!  Perfectly cooked, seasoned and the tortillas taste fresh. I try to eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's my local spot, and the only downside is that it's not open late into the night. I have a craving the other day and got the super nachos and the chile rellano burrito. Gooey, cheesy, spicy deliciousness. I have tried almost everything on the menu here, and have never been disappointed. It tasted like overstuffed, inexpensive neighborhood burrito joint should taste.  I have friends come visit from back east and this is their first stop every time. Yum!"}
{"text":"How the eff have I not reviewed this place already? 

I love the bean & cheese burrito from Fiesta Burrito so much that I want to roll around with it naked. OK, I really just want to put it on my mouth, but in a really sexy way. 

This review might say more about my sex life than a burrito, but really drive to Fiesta immediately & get one. It's will be the best bean burrito you've ever eaten. If you disagree with me, then you should drive to Taco Bell for all your bean burrito needs. Your palette is obviously not refined enough for Fiesta Burrito.

Yeah they have a whole other menu of other stuff too, but why would I bother, when I can get a bean and cheese burrito?"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky with mexican food but they do a great job here and have a 24 hour drive through which is awesome! The staff is friendly and the food is really good too!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I affectionately refer to this place as \"Smash Taco.\" Every time we get food from here, we pound it down like a couple of rabid dogs. It's just that damn good. I don't eat there very often because I'm sure it's not the best food in the world for you, but I make going there an event because, simply, it tastes incredible.

If you are looking for cheap, delicious Mexican cuisine, go here. Not those fancy Phoenix gourmet taco joints that skimp you on everything. Smash Taco is the real deal."}
{"text":"So, i dont expect much when i dine at these types of establishments and try not to make habbit out of it but when its late and you are hungry you find Fiesta Burrito.  I keep it really simple with a chicken burrito but EVERY time i order the same thing i get something different, and get upcharged for someting...Staff is pretty cool but when i get my beans on the side instead of in the burrito..$3...or the next time $.75... or during the day..free.  Quality is bad but again, i dont expect much out of these places."}
{"text":"Love this place!! This place is fast and easy to get food from. They are open late and early. Their pricing is super affordable and the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So much.

Ever since Texano's in Tempe closed, Fiesta Burrito has been my go-to place for adobada burritos. A side of sour cream is a necessity with the adobada burrito and they give you a good portion for the price. I also like lots of pico and they have a big container of it inside at the salsa bar.

The machaca plate with egg (#11) is my second favorite. I always use the accompanying tortilla to make my own burrito, plus I get the rice and beans on the side. Yum.

The quesadilla supreme is also very good, but I would recommend eating it with a fork and knife, they really load it up.

Overall, I have never had anything bad from Fiesta and the staff is always super friendly. Plus there's a drive-thru. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Fiesta Burrito for months now, and the food is always good. From the breakfast burritos, to the various entrees, the food always hits the spot. It's not exceptional, but there is never a wait, and I know I can always count on getting my Mexican food fix here, and that makes me happy."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why, but Fiesta Burrito blows away the 'somebody-bertos' which are all over the valley.

My first clue that this place would be better than the average was seeing the fire truck and ambulance parked outside. Firefighters are typically great cooks, and if they are eating at a place, it is a great sign.

My most recent visit, I was hungry, in a hurry, and wanted something tasty. I was in the area and hit Fiesta Burrito. I got a carne asada burro and a plain cheese crisp. Even though the line of cars was six deep, the line moved smoothly and before I knew it, I was paying for my lunch.

Getting back to the office, I was pleased to discover a tasty burro and the cheese crisp was very good. Please note, this is not America's or Gallo, but it is good in a pinch. As a bonus, you're eating at a place called 'Party Burrito'! How can you lose?

Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place so freaking much! They are super cheap, delicious, and they never get my order wrong. Filly B's is lame compared to this place. I've lived in Phoenix my whole life, and I spent many of those years eating at all the \"bertos\" of the valley. This is definitely my favorite spot for cheap Mexican right now."}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh but the portions are really small, I got the large size and I don't eat that much. Typically one order from other restaurants would last me two meals.

I finished the steak bowl and was really hungry so I went to Wafflian, their waffles are also small! so I went home hungry.. not what you are looking to do when you go to the food court."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos! 
Granted, I've never ordered anything else, and it's only one of many items on their menu, but those breakfast burritos ROCK! 
Add condiments/sauces of your choice, and you're starting your day right! 
Very clean, very friendly and VERY inexpensive! 
Try it! You'll like it!"}
{"text":"The 5 Rolled tacos (4 bucks) were better than normal, but they were skimpy with the guacamole and cheese on top. Very skimpy. Ordered a baby side of rice for 70 cents which was a nice since a normal side goes for a crazy 3 bucks. Scottsdale prices at a taco shop? The red sauce was the best part of the experience as it contained a good zing. How can rolled tacos be ready in 30 seconds at a drive through? I doubt these are fried up when I order - they must be sitting in a warmer somewhere. Might be best to get a burrito that they hopefully cook to order, but who knows at these kind of places. Few beers beforehand always helps the taste too."}
{"text":"The closest authentic taco joint open late in Scottsdale... lol three rolled tacos and a machaca torta and horchata at 12am. Food was fast. I was a fan of the three rolled tacos, the guac was great, but everything else was just good... I kinda wanted amazing... will try again someday."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food lacked flavor. Wouldn't go back.  Had better Mexican food back home"}
{"text":"This is my local taco shop. I like their tostadas and bean+cheese+rice burritos. They are reasonably price, and quick. They have a drive thru which is a nice feature in a taco shop! Make sure to ask for sauces."}
{"text":"Despite the annoying construction happening right in front of this place, there is always a line in the drive thru and the staff are quick to move through it. I've been here so many times I've tried just about everything on the menu. The breakfast burritos are my favorite. The carnitas burrito is very good and filled with a hearty amount of meat. The green chile burrito is also another favorite. You won't be disappointed! Fyi, its nothing fancy. Prices are totally reasonable and service is great."}
{"text":"You know I think it's important to trust the Yelp these kind of reviews you think this place woukd good and it is good it's one of the cleanest I've been into I had the number 14 Carnitas plate."}
{"text":"This is my favorite little mexican taqueria in the neighborhood. 

It's GREASY as can be. However the food is really tasty if you can handle the grease. Sometimes that's what you want!"}
{"text":"We have frequented Fiesta since 2012. Truly good Mexican food and what's even better.....they have a DRIVE-THRU!!!!! Breakfast burritos, tacos, taquitos, nachos, beans, rice, guacamole......YUMMY!! They also have the best fountain soda ever; carbonated perfectly!!! We moved in 2013 but we still drive almost an hour just to visit Fiesta, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos shredded beef can't beat them best in town! Carrots and peppers with them perfect combo. Drive though speaker is horrible needs replacement. Easier to order inside, service is good place is clean and food is quality I normally avoid the all of the burttos places.. This place is great!"}
{"text":"If you like mexican food try this place. The food is awesome and for a decent price.  You really cant go wrong here. They have a salsa bar and the service is fast like speedy Gonzales fast."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just spoiled to the authentic Mexican food we have back home in Southern California. But after a long long day of drinking on the Salt River, The group decided to swing by Fiesta Burrito in an effort to feed our beer munchies

Again like all Authentic Mexican places they take cash only, that being said, I had to spot a buddy of mine for his meal. I ordered the rolled taco's w/ guac and a carne asada burrito. I was blown away.....no carne asada fries?? That's a staple back home!!!

The burrito was pretty big and had tons of carne asada packed in there, the rolled taco's had a good amount of guac on em but skimpy on the cheese. Also this did cost a little more than what I'm used to paying back at home. I guess if I need a Mexican fix and I'm out in AZ I'll come back but other than that I'll be glad to go home to Alerto's, Los Alazanes, and Taqueria de Anda for some Carne Asada Fries."}
{"text":"We all know Fiesta Burrito has great food, but that's not my issue here. PRICES. They have raised their prices almost comparable to sitting down at a full service dining restaurant. A carne asada burrito, beans and rice combination: $9.28... with the burrito having shrunk in bulk noticeably. 
Not sure if they have lost business and are struggling, or if they are hoping to reap the benefits of the new mass apartment complexes going in across the street from them."}
{"text":"This is my fave burrito place downtown. I don't know what the other people mean when they say portions are small, because the portion I get every time is ginormous. It's not like a baby's arm but a whole baby. The owner knows I come around and I enjoy their food, so he always wraps me a hefty one. I like to think that I could eat a lot, but I am always humbled by the Fiesta Burrito. I always feel guilty about eating dinner when I eat Fiesta for lunch or feel guilty about breakfast if I eat fiesta for supper. That's how big and filling it is.

Of course, the food gotta taste good and it does. My favourite burrito here is the fish burrito & steak burrito. Both of them really hit the spot and got good flavour profile. Spicy pork is also bomb dot com. The guacamole is always green, so you know that avocado be fresh. 

Pros:
1) Relatively cheap for what you get (just about 10 bucks for large burrito) = full stomach
2) Service is top-notch. My favourite is the owner (the dude), or his wife. 
3) Fresh & Good Quality Ingredients
4) It's right next to McDonald's so you can grab a nice McD Coffee. 

Con:
1) Not open 24hr & Sundays. I get random cravings but can't satiate them.

***Pro Tip: Whenever you are about to order & it's an owner at the counter, do a little bow and say \"Ahn nyung ha sae yo, Sah Jang Nim.\" ( ) to kick start the conversation. It'll guarantee you a huge burrito. You're welcome.***"}
{"text":"Typically a solid burrito joint but today for reasons unknown they put pico on a bean and cheese burrito. Cilantro is one of my least favorite flavors so spoiled a whole burrito. If you go I guess specify what you don't want on your burrito even if the ingredient isn't on the menu description."}
{"text":"For being a fast food Mexican restaurant, the food here was surprisingly good and was better than expected. I have been here a few times before and I liked their chicken tacos which also comes with rice and beans. Overall the meal was great with the chicken tacos being tasty. The prices for the food are very reasonable and they're also open late night and have a drive-thru, so it's a very convenient option if you're in the south Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Is this fast food?!  For some reason, this hole-in-the-wall appears so random to me.  Because I'm so accustomed to taco trucks/Mexican restaurants in LA areas, I was at first hesitant to try until I saw the reviews.  I would consider this place authentic, affordable, and offers you a good portion of food if you want your Mexican fix.  They don't have carne asada fries, but they do have carne asada (haha, we made the mistake of asking if they had french fries).  I got their fish burrito and really liked it.  Will definitely come back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Fiesta Burrito! The staff is friendly and welcoming, a real nice family owned joint. 
My favorite is the Country Burrito; eggs, potatoes & cheese to which I always add sour cream & jalepenos. 
My son loves the #20 - chimicangas, the #3 - 2 cheese enchies & 
the #4 - cheese enchie & tostada. The #4 is a favorite of all of us. My daughter is all about the California burrito, no pico add sour cream. This place knows our faces by now and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet! The lack of a fifth star is because once I found meat in my burrito...I don't eat meat. BUT, they are awesome and a no brainer when it's time to eat and no one can agree which place is best!
Yummy red sauce!"}
{"text":"I eat here pretty often. Around 3 days a week during the school year. I'm probably addicted. This place is so much better than Chipotle. Every time I get a burrito bowl at Chipotle, I feel sick after but not at Fiesta Burrito! I never feel sick after I eat! Its really great. I would eat here every school day but that's sort of embarrassing. I recommend the steak burrito bowl with everything (or you know whatever you want on it)."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the best of the fast burrito joints around town. You know, all those berto places, this beats them hands down. If you live in or around Old Town, you need to get yourself a late night burrito from this place pronto. Although, if you don't know about it yet, I'm not really sure I can get on board with your life choices thus far. Who are you?"}
{"text":"When I started working in the area last year I was disappointed by the lack of healthy options in the food court, so I was happy to see a burrito bar. My first 2 times here they didn't have what I wanted. So I go to order the fish, and he tells me they don't have that, I got the crispy chicken as recommendation from the counter guy, I did not enjoy it. It tasted like old oil, but I still gave them another chance. Second time I pop in and ask for a fish. \"They are sold out\"......They must be that good! so elusive.... couldn't even get my hands on one. So off the counter persons recommendation I get the spicy pork. It wasn't the worst it wasn't the greatest. I've been trying to eat healthier protein options. The crispy chickens old oil taste and spicy pork flavours overwhelmed the whole experience. When I was finally able to get a fish burrito, DELICIOUS! and I ate that for 3 weeks straight. 1/10 times I've gotten a old oil tasting fish burrito. Haven't been back in awhile. They have a rewards system so I was trying to get free burritos too. Filled out 2 stamps cards before I started eating at other places."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 tacos with only cilantro and onion and 4 flautas with chips and salsa with two small cokes and I received 4 tacos with guacamole and pico de gallo.. And two large drinks \"diets\" cokes also the chips and salsa was chips and pico de gallo"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and utterly DELICIOUS.

I regularly visit Fiesta Burrito to curb my desire for (you guessed it) a big ol' burrito. You can get a huge plate of tasty Mexican food here for only a few dollars. And your food is usually ready in less than three minutes. I'm being serious. This place is gold.

Try their chimichanga plate or the rolled tacos with guacamole, and order a \"pina\" drink to go along with it. It's great for lunch, dinner or midnight snacking."}
{"text":"Step up from the *Betos options.  I ordered the two burrito combo, one bean and one beef...two meals in one box.  The beef burrito is somewhat like a fajita burrito with green peppers and onions and not something I'd typically order if the menu description was more detailed but it works and I've ordered it several times since my first unexpected experience.  Beans are good and not overly salted same with the rice, I'll drive the extra miles to skip *Betos / *Bertos options."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Portions are big, so bring your appetite!  Prices are reasonable too, especially when you see the portions."}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada Burrito I've had since moving from CA. Good sized burrito too, and I didn't even break $6 before tip. A lil bit out of the way of my house in Mesa but I'll happily make the drive anytime."}
{"text":"High expectations based on the reviews, as I love divey burrito spots. 
 Unfortunately, expectations were not met.  I had the breakfast burrito with machaca.  Three basic issues.  First, the burrito was bland.  Not much flavor at all.  Second, the salsas are disappointing - super watery and very little flavor.  You can't have a great burrito without great salsa.  One point deduction for the salsa fail.  Finally, there was too much tortilla, not enough filling.  I get they want to keep the price low, and that's fine, but don't use such a big tortilla if you're not going to fill it.  Another point deducted for the underfilled tortilla.  Overall, not worth the longish drive out from Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"We came here after a night of very heavy drinking, or I should say during. We took to the drive through and got some food to help us out. I ordered some sort of pork burrito and it was shear bliss. I love Mexican food and didn't think anywhere could top Southern CA for its Mexican. I was wrong. This place was even drive through and it was amazing. The flavors were plentiful and delicious. I wanted to go back so bad the next day but sadly it never happened. I know where I'll be going though for my drunk food fixes next time I visit!"}
{"text":":::::PROS:::::

Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.

Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.

Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.

Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?

:::::CONS:::::

None.

Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...

Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???

Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Came here today to grab a quick lunch on my way into the office.   I picked one of their combos (#6) it came with a shredded beef burrito, cheese enchilada and rice and beans.  I did not eat the enchilada but I did really enjoy the burrito and some of the beans.  Really... you cannot beat this price $5.83!!!  The burrito had shredded beef, a little bit of green peppers and I think I saw little pieces of potato, it was very tasty!  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Not even comparable to other Mexican fast food!  I haven't had one thing off their extensive menu I didn't like!  Chorizo or ANY breakfast burrito, tostada's, bean burritos... whatever.  Yummy,  and the service is consistently great.  Try their Carne Asada... Anything!  Lol. The local firemen are there several times a week so u know it has to be tasty!!"}
{"text":"Shocked this place has 4 stars. First off you can always tell if a Mexican food place is good based on the beans and the salsa. Well guess what both suck! Eat at el molino's and you will never come here again!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I made fun of my boyfriend's addiction to this place for a long time, but I now understand it.  I have a rather sensitive stomach and a lot the other _____berto's style restaurants have an adverse effect on my digestive system.  While this is not a ______berto's by name, it is of the same style, but I have had no digestive repercussions.  

Oh, and the food is actually good!  The burritos are hefty, the rolled tacos are greasy (but in a good way), the guacamole is tasty and even the fish tacos are yummy.  

This place is cheap, tasty and on my way home from work.  A TRIFECTA!"}
{"text":"LOVE the burritos here. I live in the appartment above the food court which its in and come here all the time. They have such fresh ingredients and the burritos are way better than at the chain burrito joints. Its also great to support a family business over those corporate dicks who make money from your buying of their mediocre food. These burritos are the real deal for sure. Love em."}
{"text":"This was fantastic.  I had the country breakfast burrito (egg, potato, & cheese).  Everything was nice and fresh and not too greasy.  It honestly tasted like something I would make at home, but better because someone else cooked it.  Fast drive thru service and there was 4 cars behind me.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other goodies on the menu."}
{"text":"Needed a snack for my toddler son and this place came through. Friendly and fast drive-thru, great tortillas and flavorful pulled chicken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and the food is always delicious! Definitely better than the Filiberto's down the street. I absolutely love the carne asada fries. They are the best!"}
{"text":"If you want fast service, delicious & inexpensive Mexican food come here!! I used to eat at Los Favorito's until I found this place and now I'm never going back! They also have the nicest staff! 
They also have a really clean kitchen & you can watch them make your food! They have better service than I could have ever expected!"}
{"text":"good food. their tortas and chimichangas are delicious :D
anyone know what oil they use on their meats/breads? thanks."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Los Angeles and wanted some authentic mexican food and did not find it here. the food was bland, flavorless. Never again. Ugh messed up my night ."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Great food!  I've lived in the neighborhood since 2003 and just recently experienced this delicious establishment.  Why?  Because, I assumed they were like all the rest...boy, was I wrong."}
{"text":"I ordered the 5 fried tacos. The filling was a little bland, at first I couldn't tell if it was shredded chicken or beef. It was OK. If I go back I'd would try a different dish. That's a big IF."}
{"text":"One of the best bean and cheese chimichanga's out there, and by far the best one for the price.  I would eat here more often if I enjoyed feeling super bloated after a single meal from this place.

Small parking lot, minimal seating, but the drive thru has always been quick and convenient for me.  Definitely recommend this over the bland boringness of Filiberto's."}
{"text":"Suuuuuper great food, and im not even a huge mexican food fan! I never order anything other than my \"California Burrito with Guacamole and Bacon\" Sometime I even add extra pico. This is my all time fav mexican dish to eat. Never super greasy, always delish. 
Occasionally the place will forget my guac or bacon, but they are usually pretty good about redoing the burrito. However, I will say the prices are slightly high. All the add-ons really ADD ON. Inside a refill is 69 cents, and they charge for extra hot carrots or pico. 
Its not a bad place for some good mexican food at a fair price."}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I have ever had. The staff was friendly and quick service.
 I found this using Yelp and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The food is great here! 
I stop here for breakfast & lunch often. This is not a filabertos.
Great food, price & service!"}
{"text":"Somewhat of a regular.  I always get the bean and cheese chimichanga.  Never had an issue.  Food always comes out fast and piping hot.

Probably the best chimi for the price, anywhere.  I'll always come back to you, Fiesta Burrito.  Viva la salsa roja!"}
{"text":"Good solid burrito joint food.

It seems much cleaner and better run than most -berto places.
You won't be overwhelmed with the hugeness of your burrito but it's (somewhat) made up for in quality.


Good value, nice owner. delicious food."}
{"text":"This is nearly always our first stop when we come back home to Scottsdale. I usually have the fish tacos but this time I ordered the beef burrito plate. Oh dear lord! That was soooo good. Shredded beef, never ground, is what sets these guys apart. Of course we'll be back!!! Again and again."}
{"text":"Good, made to order Mexican food. I probably do more breakfast burritos than other menu items. Full tortillas and salsa bar. Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Before school, I usually start the morning with a burrito from Fiesta Burrito if I have no time to cook. It covers the nutrients I need to start the day with a bunch of good quality ingredients! I usually get chicken or beef burrito bowl. Their service is amazing too :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast burritos around! The service is pretty quick and they have a nice salsa bar inside for you to fill your own containers. The weekends get a little busy with the National Guard base soldiers out to eat, but it's worth the wait! I wouldn't recommend a plain bean and cheese burrito as it's very flavorless. Parking is ample with Pepsi products on the fountain!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for quick breakfast burritos. I either get the standard with eggs, ham, cheese and pico or the machaca with shredded beef, eggs, and cheese. Both come with sides of red or green sauce. The tortillas have a nice texture and all of the ingredients are cooked together for an overall great distribution of egg:cheese:meat. They'll even toss potatoes in the mix if you ask. 

Watch out because these burritos are hot and tend to leak just a tad. They're big too, so you only need one. Check these guys out next time you're sobering up from a long night or if you're craving one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. 

They offer drive-thru and sit down. If you eat inside, they have a small salsa bar."}
{"text":"Best drive through Mexican food in Scottsdale. I go out of my way for this place.
I used to live down the street from this little gem. I would pass by everyday and assume that it was. A typical burrito stand serving mostly stomach aches and loose stools. One (late) evening on the way home from old town we stopped for something to soak up the bourbon. What happened that night was magical. This would be no one night (burrito) stand.

Fiesta burrito, translation: party of meat, beans, and rice in a blanket, is in fact, amazing.

It servers your very typical Mexican food. Burritos of all sorts, rolled tacos, etc.
The difference is that deist prepares things freshly and they do it well.

I now live ~ 20 miles from fiesta. Thankfully I work one day a week in Tempe and go out of my way on the ride home to stop by.

My favorites:

The breakfast burritos: I usually go for the sausage and egg but they are all great. Simple and made fresh.

The carnitas burrito. My cracking. Juicy pork with pico and guac. Hits the spot every time.

The carne asada burrito. Much better than other places I have found around Phoenix. Spicy and savory.

Rolled tacos. Not sure why these are particularly good here but I think it is the Fuad they put on top.

A few months ago at the 5th mile of the of the of changs half marathon, which ran right down McDowell  I almost stopped running to get a burrito. Only the fact that I had no money and the fear of a burrito belly for the next 8 miles kept me going. Next time I'm stopping."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Mexican food since I was raised on the good stuff. 

The other day I had to have a burrito. I don't know why but NOTHING else would satisfy me. It had to be a bean burrito. 

I made myself fresh tortillas for this purpose alone but I realized we didn't have any beans!! Frantically I called my grandma to ask if she had some and she said she just ran out. I didn't have all day to make fresh beans. I wanted a burrito now!

So finally I sucked it up and drove down the road to fiesta burrito. I thought to myself that as long as it was better than Taco Bell, I'd be able to satisfy my craving.

FOUR BUCKS FOR A DRIVE THROUGH BEAN BURRITO!?

I thought to myself that this was kind of expensive but I got it anyways. After all, I needed a burrito. What I got was worth it's weight in mexican gold.

What I was given was the biggest burrito that I'd ever seen in my life. Seriously this burrito could have ended me if it chose to. It was the best bean burrito that I'd ever had. Maybe even more than my grandmas homemade ones. I can't even begin to describe the joy I felt while eating this thing. I couldn't even eat half of it in one sitting. It actually became THREE separate meals for me. Each time I reheated it, it was still just as good as the first. 

I know my mexican food, and this is probably the most authentic in the valley."}
{"text":"Great carne asada chimi, combo #20, crispy and flavorful.  Lots of Guacamole too.  The staff were laughing and singing in the back, great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love Fiesta Burrito! Their California burrito is delicious. Super nachos? Amazing. The beans are so light, fluffy, and flavorful. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they are super stingy with the hot sauce. I ordered four items the other day and only got two tiny containers of hot sauce. I even asked for extra..offered to pay also. She said okay but obviously didn't give me any more. I love this place, but give me more hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito is a great Mexican Food restaurant.  If you're not very hungry, one taco will fill you up, probably almost 4 oz of meat.

The two-burrito combinations are an awesome deal.

I like that their chicken is slow cooked and falls apart; it is not greasy. They fill their tacos and burritos with a good portion of chicken.

Their carne asada is good quality and lean.  In the carne asada plate, they serve a few big slices, and in the tacos it's chopped; you won't get a lot of chopped pieces of fat; maybe one or two, it's quite lean.

If you're hungry for a taco, but also want a bit of beans, order a tostada.

The burrito mixta has machaca beef, beans, and green chiles. It's excellent."}
{"text":"Got 2 breakfast burritos with egg shells in them. Normally a good place but this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Yummy & Cheap Mexican food!!!!  You have to try this place.  The best Carne Asada Burrito!!!"}
{"text":"Never in my many visits to Fiesta Burrito...and there have been a lot of them...have I been disappointed.  

Never has the food tasted like it was made a week ago.

Never have I had to spit anything out, hoping it had, at least, originated from the cow.

Never have I had cause, or been afraid to check the restaurant inspections naughty list.

I am a fan."}
{"text":"A rare yelp disappointment!  Just a touch about Filiberto's and that's a very generous compliment.  

I ordered the two carne asada burrito combo with rice and beans.  The rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans.  My wife chewed on something that definitely wasn't carne asada and had to spit it out.  My carne asada was rubbery and just average at best. Everything about this place was a disappointment, even the prices which I thought were actually high for a hole-in-the-wall that you have to look hard to find.  

Do yourself a favor and get a carne asada somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is so authentic, I wouldn't drink the water...

I was introduced to this place via a friend of a friend, who enjoyed the late night delight of real Mexican food. Guess, they just call it food. \"Pause for laughter\" Anyways, I tried this place once...too authentic for me but it was good! Its one of those places I spoke about. The washed out pics (cause you don't need to see them: Main theme rice, beans, some kind of meat), original spanish names for the dish, and drive thru...yes the mexican food drive thru! I love it. This places gets 4 stars because it didn't pass the health inspection report, but I still eat there despite. That's good food."}
{"text":"My go-to late night weekend joint for food after midnight or so when the pickins get slim. Quality of food remains good late night or early morning

This place is to Scottsdale what King Taco now is to downtown Pasadena - Mexican fast food with lots of options on the menu, cheap, and open late night, as an alternative to expensive restaurants in the area after hours

I've hit the rolled tacos, the chicken nachos plate, and the tortas here

All solid choices! And super cheap! Do leave a tip?"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and wanted good, authentic Mexican. Didn't necessarily want fast food but this place has good reviews and was very close to my hotel. Glad I decided to try it. I would have given 5 stars buy paid like $3 for \"chips and salsa\", which ended up being chips covered in Pico de Gallo.  They were ok but most places give you chips and the salsa bar had the same pico.  Anyway, the Carne asada tacos were good. :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm! Thank you Fiesta, lunch with you is always good.  I'd recommend the mixed burrito with shredded beef, beans, and cheese with no veggies."}
{"text":"Always great food and quick service! Definitely a go to and one of the best places to get a burrito."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick bite to eat, no matter what time of day! Really great portions of protein in the selections so you end up full and satisfied! Also a very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican food. Some of the best I've had in the valley. It is a little shop and serves food exactly how you'd expect. Their breakfast food is fantastic. I knocked them one star because, as good as their breakfast is, they do not serve coffee and they charge for refills on soda. Overall, really good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy simple northern mexican food and this place hits the spot.  It is a dive, hole in the wall and that makes it all the better!"}
{"text":"Number 18 baby! 2 carne asada burritos with rice and beans! Me and the Mr will share that plus a cheese quesadilla.. super friendly drive thru service on the cheap! Many notches above your standard 'Berto's fare.. here the ingredients seem of better quality plus my ass doesn't hurt the next day! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard fast food Mexican place. The good parts about the place are that the service is really fast and the outside of the chimichanga was pretty fluffy but still crispy at the same time. Besides that the rice and beans were pretty mediocre and the horchata was really weak too. Also the styrofoam plate I got ended up getting a hole in it because it was so thin."}
{"text":"Listen, for a quick bite to eat for on the go, this place it great! I've come here a few times because I hate fast food and this place nailed it with being fast yet not fast foodish. I've ordered a bean and cheese burrito, chicken tacos, and quesadillas. The chicken was a tad bland and dry but beats taco bell by far. I'm glad I found it. Fresh and great price."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get burritos in the city, not only is it very close to my work but I just find that they do it right with the flavours and portions. I always get a veggie burrito with all the toppings (which is how it comes standard). They do not skimp on the guac nor do they charge extra for it unless you are getting extra that is. They are always very fast and efficient which is important for lunch orders. I usually use the Ritual app to place my order so it is ready when I get there. Yah no one wants to sit in the Grange because you will end up smelling like the foods of the world, unless you're into that. I always take mine to go, there is outdoor tables across the street if you want to sit outside."}
{"text":"One of the best burritos in town. Korean fusion with some of the meat items. I highly recommend the bbq beef. Service was excellent"}
{"text":"There's excellent value here at Fiesta Burrito, but unfortunately in this humble Yelper's opinion that value comes at the expense of quality. I've found some excellent fast Mexican across the country, but Fiesta Burrito comes in a bit below average, which was disappointing considering the reviews. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

There's nothing fancy at Fiesta Burrito, but one thing that there is is speed. Cash or card doesn't matter, and almost irrespective of what you order you'll have it hot and ready often under five minutes. That's impressive and certainly star-worthy. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Herein lies the goods folks. While I didn't take a picture, I opted for a steak and egg breakfast burrito, and cocked an eyebrow when I saw that it only cost $4.50. How big could this thing honestly be at a price point of only $4.50? Well folks, it turns out that it can be pretty damn big. I didn't take a picture, but imagine essentially a fully loaded Chipotle burrito. That's value. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Unfortunately, value doesn't always arrive hand in hand with quality, and that was very much the case here. 

One thing I will say is that the tortilla was fantastic. I'm not sure if it was freshly made, but it tasted as though it was with a buttery flavor and grilled texture. However, the goods essentially stopped there. The eggs were bland, the cheese basic, and the steak questionable. To top it all off, for whatever reason this burrito had what must have been a full cup of grease coming out of it. Not good. 

Sure, there was some decent (but runny) green salsa verde that improved things a little bit, but outside of the tortilla there was virtually no flavor here (salt? pepper? anyone?), which was really disappointing. No Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

It would appear that Fiesta Burrito has a loyal local following here in the valley, which I always like; but the experience left much to be desired for this out of towner. No Star Granted."}

Ahoy maties. The day has come. I finally scrapped up enough courage and willpower to give this place another try. It took a lot of time and convincing, but nonetheless ya girl came through. 

I decided to go with the Spicy Pork Burrito. Regular size, it was around $7-8. The spicy pork was seriously the way to go. Like honestly, it was just really good. If yall have ever tried the Philly Steak Pita at Pita Pit, it kind of tastes like that minus the fact that there were beans and rice. Eating it was like heaven (especially when the guac was in the mix HOLY SHIT BALLS MATE THEY NEED TO GIVE ME MORE GUAC AHHH) Definitely gonna get this from now on Next time, I wanna kick up the spicy game. I got it mild and it wasn't doing me justice. I need the extra kick to get myself all fired up for my 3 hour lecture class. :( It needs to be spicy to the point where it can wake up the demon within me. LOL

update: an upgrade to the next spicy level isn't as good; has a slight bitter taste to it 
 
I don't know if I mentioned this in my previous review, but I liked the service here. The lady working there was really nice and so smiley and I LOVE THAT LIKE BLESS YOUR SOUL. THAT IS THE KIND OF STUFF I LIKE TO SEE AND EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for late night/after hours food.  The carne asada burrito and soft tacos are good, and they hit the spot. The green chile burrito is pretty bland tho .  The red sauce/salsa definitely has a little kick to it and helps if u like spicy."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. They have the best chorizo burritos. They're big and full and the rolled tacos with guac and cheese are delicious! We come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"3 rolled taco with cheese... 

Fast friendly service 

Great tasting food."}
{"text":"Mexican places like this need to be judged based on consistency - here's what I mean:

42% of the time I've been hungover
30% of the time I've been drunk
22% of the time I've been sober
6%   of the time (other)

Food tastes great no matter what, and it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito is meh. As an Arizona native I'm picky with my Mexican food. I am always skeptical of drive-thru Mexican restaurants but I was so hungry and the reviews looked good.....

I ordered the carnitas burrito and a medium hortchata. For the record, the hortchata is excellent! Sugary and sweet, but lighter than most. The burrito was huge - definitely a meal and a half. I didn't like the burrito at all, unfortunately. Everything was fresh and the tortilla, quac, and pico were on point. The carnitas, however, was dry and fatty. I couldn't even chew through some bites.

I'm not really surprised with my experience at Fiesta Burrito. It's cheap and quick and similar to most fast food Mexican joints. I might come back here in the future. If I do, I will be ordering vegetarian! Cheese enchiladas, bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and don't forget the hortchata!"}
{"text":"Alright, so a bunch of the other Agents in my office come back from this place for lunch and even breakfast, so I figured I would try it cant be all that bad right.... Exactly!!!

It was very good food. I got the special today which was 2 rolled tacos, a beef taco and a bean tostada, and a another beef taco for one of my coworkers all for about $8.50.

the beef was good, the tacos were fresh and crispy and everything made to order. The only issue I had is they had a lot of cheese on the plater itself, but none of it was even remotely melted, and maybe it's just me, but I like melted cheese. It makes me think fresh made and that it's hot.

The interior was expected, just like a Filabertos or any other taco shop. A Nice Salsa Bar with pico, red sauce, green sauce, Whole Jalapenos and Spicy carrots.

Parking can be a little difficult as they on have 9 spaces two of which are handicapped, but they also have a drive thru. Definitely not enough parking for the table space and outside patio they have.

Well that's all for now...."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are so friendly and the food is always amazing! They are tike efficent and know what they are doing. Very happy with this place, i will keep going there"}
{"text":"My family and I live close to Fiesta Burrito and love it! Their food is great and one of our favorite fast food places. My youngest daughter has eaten here since she was in high school and her favorite go to menu item is the bean and cheese burrito with green sauce inside. The employees are great too and already know us at the drive thru window."}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday for a breakfast burrito.  I went with the bacon and it was great. Huge, filling and tasty. Oh yeah, and it was only $5. The green salsa was kinda weak - really watery."}
{"text":"Shredded beef nachos hit the spot for a late night craving. I have enjoyed coming to this place for years. The employees are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm drooling just thinking about how good this place is. The food is fresh and the cooks work so fast. If a Unicorn and Filiberto's had a baby, it would be this place."}
{"text":"OK, first of all this is not a 5 star restaurant. It is however an awesome drive thru and quick sit down spot. Their food is great. Try the California Burrito! Ayaya. Love it!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: after my last experience with Fiesta Burrito I have to say I AM NEVER GOING BACK. Why? I asked for a California burrito with guacamole, got charged for the guacamole, but it was never in my burrito. The burrito seemed to shrink 10% more than the last time I thought it shrank. It was definitely not worth the price at all. I
 also got charged for an extra drink. When I went back to ask for my refund for the guacamole and the extra drink I was charged for the men just looked at me like I was crazy. He offered me a cup instead (which I didn't need I already had my drink) and I saw one man in the back filling up a tiny cup of guacamole (which I didn't need either because I had already eaten the tiny burrito) All I wanted was my $3.00 back for things I never received. 



this place is always my go-to place for fast late night Mexican Food (only when Tacos Jalisco is closed) cleaner also. I know I wont have to worry about cockroaches roaming my food. I love how theyre so fast, and the food comes out tasting decent.

what I am concerned about is how small their burritos have gotten over the years. don't get me wrong, theyre still beasts, but they have definitely shrank in width. i know regulars would agree. their customer service is a bit lacking, so don't feel bad if theyre not attentive and don't exactly cater to your needs. you have to tell them if you want any extras and other customizations. 


regardless, this is the place to go for super fast delicious Mexican food, that wont make you sick! PARTY burrito!"}
{"text":"I literally have to utilize all self control each time I drive by Fiesta. Definitely one of my favorite spots to drive through and get lunch during a busy day. I get a #2 and a bean and cheese burrito and obviously extra sides of the red sauce. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I was very hopeful of this place. Right off the bat I seen a lot of great reviews and a loyal local customer base. Right off the bat to Yelpers... WATCH WHAT YOU EAT. I go inside with my girlfriend and decide to order the two carne asada burrito combo plate. Our burritos come out quick with the contents on the side, guacamole and the beans. My girlfriend likes to spoon her ingredients into her burrito bite by bite so she was very conscious of what bites she was taking. About half way into her burrito she spots a thin hair right in between the tortilla, god knows what body part that came from. I seen it in her face that she was about ready to throw up. She brings it to the attention to the cashier woman who really isn't fazed by the hair. One of the cooks in the background who over heard turned his back to us as if annoyed that we found a hair. So sorry if I bothered you with a hair that I didn't want in the burrito in the first place. I asked for my money back on one burrito, the one my girlfriend ate since I already ate mine unknowing if I ate anything myself. As soon as I did that both the cashier and a man who appeared to be the manager began inspecting the burrito. After really examining the proof the man nodded and the cashier gave us the money back. No apologies or anything. I felt like we messed up more by bringing to their attention. I get that accidents happen but to  be annoyed when it comes to stuff like that really shows a business deserves poor ratings like this. Think about the customer experience cause at the end of the day customers are the ones who get you the money to continue running."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place this morning. We both got breakfast burritos and they were delicious and inexpensive. We will definitely be back again.

Update. We get breakfast burritos here almost every weekend. I love this place! Best breakfast burritos ever."}
{"text":"I lived in San Diego for six years and was never able to find a quality Carne Asada burrito out here....until I found Fiesta Burrito.  Hands down the best Carne Asada burrito in AZ; maybe even better than those in San Diego!"}
{"text":"This was very good carne asada, especially for fast food!  Only complaint was it was a little on the salty side.  Still gave them 4 stars.  :)

* I had the Carne Asada burrito with guacamole."}
{"text":"Quick service and reasonable prices. The food was pretty good, not too greasy like some had mentioned. The only down was the food wasn't hot enough, my cheese enchiladas were not melted at all and were even cold in the middle."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to order from here is the bean & cheese tostada. It always manages to be perfect! 

On the other hand, they can never seem to get my 3 rolled tacos crunchy enough. Always limp.  

It ain't easy bein' perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burritos! Heat up so well the next day, go here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I tried their chicken enchiladas and haven't moved on from there. The sauce has a little extra smokey flavor that I love. Definitely a lot of food for very little. Their chorizo burrito is good too. I've tried their fish taco, chimichunga and carnitas plate which was better than average, but not as good as some others. The service has always been fast, friendly and restaurant appears clean."}
{"text":"Decent spot, but nothing to get crazy over. Being from CA I've tried some really good Mexican food. I definitely wanted to try a spot out here in AZ. This place had some decent reviews, so we all went to try it. The surrounding area is very dark and a bit hard to see. I wouldn't say its a sketch area, but it's not as bright as the surrounding area! The guy who took my order was nice though and I ended up getting a shredded beef burrito which came with rice, refried beans and an enchilada. The burrito wasn't bad, but was a bit bland. Nothing really stood out for me. The beans and rice were good, but the enchilada just didn't taste that good. I ended up finishing it all, but this is not a spot I would probably visit again!"}
{"text":"Located inside Village by the Grange, it's a little bit easy to miss this Korean-Mexican burrito joint.  Tried a fish burrito from them (included a drink of water or pop) since it was listed as the daily combo (for $7).  I noticed on the wall that they have a stamp card of some sort, but wasn't given one when I got the combo (I guess that makes sense?). I had stopped by here for a quick bite before heading down to Queen Street and it didn't take too long for the burrito to be done.  The portion was very good for the price -- lots of rice and beans with the fish.  Definitely would come here again to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"I miss this place and am a little upset that I took them for granted when I lived nearby. 

I unfortunately don't have any place near me now that makes fast food style Mexican this good.

This is reasonably priced Mexican food that is a cut above your your typical bertos style place and it has a drive through. Places like this are not as common as you think. Appreciate it."}
{"text":"Sorry the chips aren't free afterall.  But for a buck, it's still a great deal!"}
{"text":"After moving from San Diego, where I could find some of the most delicious Mexican food it took me a while to stumble upon great tasting mexican food in Arizona. This place has really good quality food but the portions are on the small side especially for burritos."}
{"text":"Really delicious and cheap Mexican food. I have been coming here for a year now. The food is filling, greasy, and well priced."}
{"text":"If homestyle Mexican food is what you're craving, this is where to go. Just a hole in the wall place with consistently decent food at modest prices. I've eaten there since it opened for business, and they've never disappointed. I sometimes call from my driveway, and pick up my breakfast minutes later on the way to work. The owner has his act together, as do those he employs. My two favorites are the green chile burrito and the chile rellenos. Don't miss the pickled carrots, peppers, and onions. If only they had ample parking, I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this joint on the Yelp app when I was looking for a new place to try for lunch.  I must've driven by this place 1000 times and I've never noticed it....I'm glad Yelp guided me here.  It was a Saturday and the place was kind of busy.  After browsing the extensive menu on the wall, I decided to order:

Carne Asada Burrito, $4.15
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA#EwvshZHDNmhTyCwYd2NMGA

Bean and Cheese Burrito, $2.75
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w#tKBbSicI8f2ZuXeBOTzN_w

While I was waiting for my food, I mozied over to the Salsa Bar to grab a few cups of Salsa.  I give their Salsa Bar 2 Stars...because they only have the runny Green & Red Sauces, Pickled Veggies, and Pico de Gallo.  There's no chunky Salsa or really hot Salsa available.....the runny Green and Red options are very mild.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fiesta-burrito-scottsdale?select=rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw#rlP4WQj7r8ZXiB0bz7zRSw

After a short wait, my Burritos were ready.  I went for the Carne Asada first.  I took one bite and fell in love with it...it's a little different than most places like this in that they have Potatoes in the Burrito.  The Potatoes and Carne Asada create a unique flavor that tastes very good....kudos to them for putting this together!

Next was the Bean & Cheese Burrito....that too was very good.

Overall, the food here is 4 Stars...it's that good.  The lack of a hot Salsa option drops it down to 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up because I think they deserve it.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"After eating Fiesta Burrito, Filiberto's, Los Fav, and all others don't compare. Carne asada burritos from Fiesta are hands down the best I've had in Phoenix after 11 years. Drunk or sober, the food here is craveable to the point where I would give an arm and a leg to eat here one more time.

I've never dined in, nor ordered anything other than carne asada burritos. I've never had a reason to. The tortilla fresh, the meat is tasty, the perfect amount of onion and guacamole, then pour on the green sauce until your heart desires! Do not, I repeat, do not bring a date here unless you have some food fetish and want him/her to know it.

A friend of mine tried telling me that the burritos are bigger if you order in Spanish, but I disagree. Carne Asada is the same in Spanish or English... Super bueno!

Thank you Fiesta Burrito for opening my eyes to what great Mexican carne asada is all about. And also, thank you for ruining my taste buds to lesser quality Mexican restaurants. I am now going through a 12 step program to relieve the addiction you have caused. Writing this review is step 2 and I feel a relapse coming on."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim today with a craving for mexican food. The inside of the restaurant was dark, quiet, and unappealing. Ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was finished and ready to go within two minutes which is a bad sign, because it wasn't fresh. The meat had no flavor, tasted like it had been sitting in water for a while and was just generally tough. Rice was mediocre, beans looked/tasted like taco bell powdered beans, and the horchata tasted like sugar water. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"The burritos don't look that big on the picture but one is plenty enough if you plan on doing anything else that day. Great tasting burrito, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Place has been a local spot for some time. Food is pretty good. However prices have really gone up..seems like they make up thier own prices at times. Last few orders have been wrong & window services not the friendliest. Yes we will continue to go but with less frequency mostly due to the high cost of the meals."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Filibertos. I had their country burrito and it was super yummy. Had potatoes, eggs, and cheese in it. Price wise wasn't bad. Will come again."}
{"text":"Losbeto's on Hayden, let me introduce you to your first viable competitor in the department of drive thru mexican: Fiesta Burrito.

While not as cheap as Losbeto's, the food is definitely higher quality and you don't get that sneaking sensation that you might be eating roadkill, which is worth an extra buck or two. Nor do you have to allay worries that the gentleman on the other side of the window doesn't heed the \"Lavaselas!\" sign, as is the case with some. 

Nope, Fiesta is a dream come true in many respects, and is a clean and legitimate competitor to its northern neighbor (why do I suddenly feel like Joe Biden talking about Barack Obama?). The location is convenient, the service is fast, and though the bargain basement prices aren't quite there as in some others, peace of mind is, which will bring me back very soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Having left my packed lunch safely in the fridge at home (an event that happens far more often than I'd like to admit) I set off to try something new for lunch today. Fiesta Burrito was a great choice; thank you yelp!

I ordered the machaca plate, no. 11. A generous helping of machaca with egg, onions, peppers, cheese, and rice and beans on the side. A flour tortilla to scoop it all up with, some fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde from the salsa bar and I was set for a great lunch.

The food was great and inexpensive. The service was friendly and the location was very clean. 

They have a big menu with several combination plates, all with rice and beans, breakfast food served all day, and some great a la carte options if you don't want the full meal.

Compared to other drive-through/quick order Mexican food places around, my meal here was comparable to Carolina's. That's the highest praise I can think to give a place like this.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you don't like Mexican food, please stop reading and unfriend me now .

Fiesta Burrito is nearby to my work, is open 24 hours, and has a drive through. It resembles other \"Berto\"-style establishments,  which are fast food type Mexican fare. The staff is friendly,  and the older gentleman at the front always knows it is me by my order. They are also PD friendly, which is a plus.

The restaurant inside is clean. There is a small salsa bar that is never empty. I have never used the bathroom, so I can't vouch for that. Sometimes the parking lot van get difficult. There aren't many spots,  and sometimes the line at the drive through can block other traffic through the lot. The drive through goes pretty fast, so it is never a problem for long. 

The food is always hot and fresh. I have had breakfast, country, bean and cheese and Chile relleno burritos. I also have gotten macho fries, super nachos, chicken tacos, rice, beans and rolled tacos (taquitos).  They have agua fresca as well as sodas. I normally get a jamaica. I have liked everything here. The prices are fairly inexpensive.

If you are in a hurry, are headed home from the club or just want a good lunch for a good price, give Fiesta a try."}
{"text":"Not a bad little Mexican joint. Food is consistent but doesn't vary far from the classic Mexican fare, for good or bad. I h ent had this place before midnight so I couldn't tell you if the day crew is as solid as the night. Hah! I will return."}
{"text":"Simply put... I go here every single week. I think it is the best 24hr burrito shop. I don't know why, i just like the ingrediants and the way they cook their food.

Pork Adobas (sic) burrito with guac is amazing
california burritos are my favorite
love the chile relleno burrito as well..

Place is AWESOME.  ALot of these places can be all the same, but Fiesta I think is the best."}
{"text":"Fiesta is quite a bit better than your average '-berto' or '-beto' for Mexican fast food.  Carne is usually not super fatty, which seems to be a chronic problem for most of these type joints.  When in doubt, the machaca is always good."}
{"text":"Got the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito. It was ok, Just a little too greasy for my likings. And when I say greasy, I mean it looked like I killed someone afterwards. I know that the Chorizo is greasy, but I have never eaten one this greasy, ever! If I'm ever strolling by, I might give this another shot and try something else. 

Regardless, I still enjoyed the service."}
{"text":"Best drive through tacos in the area. 4 just because I haven't had anything better in the south Scottsdale area east of 64th"}
{"text":"This place is south Scottsdale's dirty little secret.  If you want the awesome authentic taste of a real hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant but with the speed of a XXX-ertos (minus the Hepatitis), this is the place to go.  I've been to this place at least twenty times and I think I only ever order four things there because they're so good: the super nachos, the rolled tacos with guacamole, chicken tacos and the two carne asada burrito plate.  Any of these selections are guaranteed to keep you full for at least ten hours.

Everything comes out piping hot and both the green and red salsa provided are excellent additions to the already tasty flavors provided.  If you are in the mood for Mexican food and you're within a ten mile radius of this place, it's certainly worth the drive."}
{"text":"I always love the small local Mexican restaurants around town. This one is good but nit favorite. I only go there for the breakfast burritos and they are amazing. They are under $5 and are twice the size you will get at any fast food restaurant. I also like how they are not dripping with grease like others. I was unimpressed with the inside of the restaurant and the worker who took my order was not very nice and didn't smile at all. I usually do the drive thru and it is quick and easy. This place is better then filibertos and is great for breakfast or a quick snack."}
{"text":"Probably one of my fave 'hole in the wall' mexican food places around. There's not too many of these types of places in North Scottsdale, so it's a nice place to stop for lunch when I'm working in Old Town; convenient location.

They have the best adobada burritos around and their tacquitos are always fresh (as is all their food). I really can't begin to name off my faves because everything I've had there is great. Seating is limited, but don't let that deter you, they do have a drive thru and all their ingredients are fresh and doesn't take long to get your order."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  I've been twice, and have been satisfied both times.  It's cheap, clean, authentic?, mexican food....Yum.   First time I went I ordered way too much...two tacos and a burrito, i finished probably half.  The burrito was ginormous.  The second time I went with  my girlfriend and ordered 2 enchiladas.  The enchiladas were cheap (like under 4 bucks) and good.  

The people at this establishment are very nice as well.  Order lightly, the portions are huge.   Nice hole in the wall.  Thanks YELP! for letting me know about this one."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 10 years and it has always been awesome!  Really good service and good food...there is a reason its usually busy!  There is also consistency in the employees which I like to see also."}
{"text":"Truly my favorite Mexican food restaurant of all time. No place in Scottsdale even compares. Trust me.
I average about 5 burritos per week. They help me stay fit and healthy. The more I eat, the better I feel about myself and the world around me. They are very nicely priced and are delivered by some of the city's finest and hardest working chefs.
My total Fiesta burrito count (I only get burritos) is rapidly approaching the 600 range, and I must say that the top contender is the California. I highly recommend the California to both beginners and experienced Mexican food eaters alike. The shredded beef burrito and carne asada burrito are also fine options if you are looking to delve into some of earth's most delectable fruits."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, and greasy. If that's not a winning combination for a fast food Mexican joint, I don't know what is. Yes, it's pretty similar to Filiberto's and Los Favoritos and Julioberto's and all the other \"berto's\" around the valley, but Fiesta Burrito shines a bit brighter than most of those in the taste category. I don't live particularly close to this location, but I can promise that whenever I'm nearby it's going to be a huge temptation. Yum."}
{"text":"So the place looks super sketch from the outside and the staff could care less about you as a human BUT not gonna lie, the food is pretty, pretty, pretty good. I always get chicken tacos with rice beans and make sure you get the red and green sauce"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast! Come here atleast once a week before heading to work. It is a little pricy but I always have leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, I may have had higher expectations than I should, but this place is really not very good. Had the carne asada burrito with rice and beans. Carne asada had almost no flavor or char (appeared to be boiled? Yuck!) Which they attempted to mask with guac and pico. Beans and rice were sub par and bland as well. Meal came out in the time it took to fill my soda, which isn't a good sign. 

If you want good, quality, flavorful Mexican food look elsewhere. The only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this places breakfast burritos!  Put some of the red sauce on there and you could skip lunch."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Go here for a breakfast burrito. Or the carne asada. Or anything really. It's fast, it's cheap, it's delicious, and there's a drive thru.

If there's such thing as good hangover memories, I've had a lot of them here."}
{"text":"Best rolled tacos I've ever had! So delicious, never been disappointed. Horchata is also amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Hate to share my secret little neighborhood gem but it would be selfish not to. The beans and their family recipe are unmatched. They're always fast and their food is reasonably priced. The girls and I love a lunch at Fiesta!"}
{"text":"Fiesta is my place! Ever since I bought my house down the street nearly 4 years ago Fiesta has been a staple in my life. Breakfast burritos on weekends, Cheese only Quesadilla for my 2 little nuggets... AZ burro's and Grande Quesadilla for dinners. 

I also love their enchilada meals with a side of Mexi Rice and beans. Everything here is delicious, and breakfast burritos at night...oh mann!!!

Also, if you want something quick or for an appetizer, chips quac and cheese for the win! Can't say enough about it.. Love love love!"}
{"text":"A pretty good hole-in-the-wall in South Scottsdale.  It's small and gets packed for lunch, but the staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I've had the tacos, the pork carnitas, tried the nachos, and the enchilada.  All have been pretty tasty, but everything is extremely greasy and I usually feel pretty gross upon exiting.  I'll probably break down and try breakfast sometime too.  Overall, you won't be disappointed with Fiesta Burrito."}
{"text":"Tiny portion sizes for the price. Chicken was very good, but the rice was bland. Might give this place one more try as their burritos seem to be a lot bigger than the chicken bowl that I ordered."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito is pretty close to my office and a few months ago one of my coworkers introduced it to me for a first time. For a quick in and out Mexican place it's definitely worth it. The prices are decent, they have a fairly extensive menu, and the service is fast. 

The downsides?

1) Parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today.
2) Seating can sometimes be limited as well. It's a fairly small joint.
3) Being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesn't leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time.

With that being said, it's definitely worth trying if you are in the area. I suggest the carne asada burrito :)"}
{"text":"This place is great, the carne asada is the best from any restaurant at any price that I have been to in AZ NM CA OR or TX. Nice people convenient location. The tortillas are excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch from a meeting at the Papago Military Reservation,check on yelp and saw this place was down the road. Small place but very welcoming, I got the chicken taco plate. Chicken was nice and tender but the beans was what got me it was cooked perfect most places are always undercooked. Next time I'm in the area again I'll be sure to be back."}
{"text":"I was recommended to check this place out last week. I have now been here twice since then. I've had the Chimichanga and the California burrito. The orders came out quickly and I received great service during both visits. The food here is great, rice and beans were rice and beans. But the Chimichanga has a nice crispiness and the tortilla seemed fresh and the chicken was delicious. The California burrito was also a great burrito. I wasn't expecting meat of that quality in a burrito under $5, but it was a welcome surprise."}
{"text":"Newest update The owner here is charging .60 for a stinking refill that costs him 2 to 3 cents. I don't know what this guy is thinking. Greed, Greed, Greed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and a generous amount of food for fast food. The chips and salsa are huge. I got carne asada tacos which were amazing. I'm full I couldn't eat all of it. Happy I tried the place out it's right down the street from mi casa!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Very good quality, impressed with this restaurant. I was in town for a day and found them on here, glad we stopped here for dinner. Great portions and worth the price."}
{"text":"Tasty burritos for around $4 each.  

They do have a drive thru, but most people get stuck sitting in it for quite a while.  They only have 4-5 parking spaces, so just be aware."}
{"text":"If you like chimichanga's you need to give this place a try. Although McDowell & Scottsdale Rd is kinda no man's land you should still give it a try."}
{"text":"Once again, the Yelpers helped us when in unfamiliar territory.    We stayed a couple of nights at the 3 Palms and ended up having breakfast here and satisfying a late night munchies craving.  

As stated in other reviews, this place is VERY clean. N Ot to say other places are not, but you don't feel like you are in a sleazy taco joint with questionable sanitary practices.

We both had a simple breakfast burrito for lunch.  While it was nothing to write home about, it was tasty and filling.

Our late night snack was a big time pleaser!  Had a few tacos and and an order of the rolled tacos with guacamole.  Perfect!  Would eat that same order for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

If you are in that neck of the woods, drop in and order up some good Mexican fast food!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Fiesta about 6 years ago by a friend of mine at the time, who lived around the corner. The friendship with her did not last, but my love for Fiesta Burrito did! From the Carne Asada or Bean and Cheese burrito to the Adobada tacos, Fiesta rocks! 

One morning at work, my urge to skip my usual yogurt or oatmeal overcame me and I wanted a burrito (almost always a bean and cheese. yeah for breakfast. I'm strange like that!). I announced that I was going to my favorite taco shop and the questions starting rolling in. Where is this place? Are they good? etc etc. By the time I left, I had six orders, not including mine. So now every time I have a burrito urge, I try to keep it to myself, lest 6+ orders. Selfish, yeah. But that saves me on having to dole out 15 cups of red, green, and/or pico. :P 

Speaking of red, green, and pico - try to only get 2 cups of green for myself. Though really I could easily use about 6 of them in one sitting. I would probably be kicking myself the next day. 

HOW in the heck does Adam Richman - Man vs Food eat all that spicy stuff and not cry the next day on the toilet?!? 

Anyhow - CLEAN, Fast, with Courteous employees. Did I mention clean??? This is NOT your average \"-bertos\" taco/burrito shop people!!"}
{"text":"nasty, I will not be coming here again. I have tried both their California burrito and their chorizo burrito and both are so greasy it's unreal. I understand that a chorizo burrito is going to be a little greasy but that was literally all I could taste, not good, stay far from this place!"}
{"text":"Best hangover cure in Scottsdale! Delicious breakfast burritos... if you're looking for tasty Mexican food in a hurry this is your spot! Great choice for late night or early morning drive thru"}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican fast food.  Always friendly service.  Clean inside and quick with the-drive thru.  Contender for best [fried] fish tacos locally.  Check your drive thru order before leaving if you have special instructions.   Eat here.  A lot."}
{"text":"Over the lips, past the gums, look out stomach here it comes!!!! For a fast food Mexican Food joint, I have to say this one is pretty tasty! I LOVE their Super Nachos! They also have decent tacos and yummy rice and beans. If you don't catch them when they are busy) you don't always get the freshest ingredients, as in sometimes I have had stale chips, or the meat wasn't as good as it usually is...... so try hitting this place during the normal B,L and D time rush. Also if you're looking for a late night snack, this place is open 24/7 so being able to stuff your face with pretty decent Mexican Food, is better than no food at all :) I have to say I will keep visiting Fiesta Burrito rather than their competition! They are better than FillyB's and close to my bf house! Alway a plus when we feel like grabbing something quick! I just wish they would stop being delicious sometimes and meh the next! Consistency is nice!"}
{"text":"Have been going to for years. The food is consistently great. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to live near this place and ever since I moved I crave it. I will end up using my entire list lunch break to drive here from work and eat in my car while I drive back. The ONLY thing I would change about this place is the order that they stack ingredients on entrées. Everyone knows that cheese goes on hot items like chips and rolled tacos FIRST and then other toppings like guacamole and sour cream. This is so the cheese will melt and provide a layer to keep moisture from toppings from seeping in to chips and other crunchy items and keep them from getting soggy. For example rolled tacos, then cheese, then guacamole. This is the only thing keeping Fiesta Burrito from a five star review. 

 They are open late
 They are fast
 They are friendly 
 They are clean
 They stack ingredients in entrées in a way that allows them to become soggy"}
{"text":"A bunch of us were drinking at Duke's and we wanted some food. It was after 1:00AM so our choices were slim and we needed something walking distance since we had walked to the bars. My friend found this place on Yelp and we decided to go since they had pretty good reviews and they were open until 2. 

We got there around 1:30 and only the drive through was open. They let us walk through the drive in anyway. Some places wont let you do that. The staff was very friendly and funny. They messed around with the rest of our friends who were ordering while we were at the window paying. They have a small outdoor patio open where we ate so we didn't have to walk and eat or take our food home. 

Our expectations for the food wasn't high and thought it'd be like Filiberto's. However, we were pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend and I both got the chicken tacos. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. I wasn't a huge fan of the hardshell. I prefer hardshell tacos but it just didn't have any flavor. 

Overall, we had a great experience and if we're ever in need of food at 1 in the morning we'll be back if we're nearby. Otherwise, not sure if I would come here when there are other restaurants opened."}
{"text":"Not as good as I had hoped for. Not horrible, but I just moved over to this area from San Diego a week ago and was looking for a little mexican shop on par with everywhere in SD. Yes, I know I am not in SD anymore so I can't expect the same thing. If I were to have found this place there I would have rated it as a generous 2 stars.  But again overall I just had better expectations for a 4.0 rating with over 130 votes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick bite to eat in the area.  I stop in so much for the carne asada burritos that the guys there know me and always say hi.  

I'd say the only downside is they recently raised prices so it's not quite so easy on the wallet to get a meal anymore, but I live my life one burrito at a time and it works."}
{"text":"This is my go to taqueria in Scottsdale, inexpensive and really good food.  

They have the best veggie burrito I have had in AZ, although can be inconsistent.  Sometimes you have to tell them what you want in it.  The 1st time I went there, they simply made me a veggie burrito with beans, rice, lettuce, etc and it was awesome.  On several other occasions, they ask me what I want in it.  On another occasion, the rice was left out altogether, so was not as good in my opinion.  This is a little odd, but no big deal.  Just be sure to tell them what you want in it.

Tacos and burritos are typical offerings, and all tasty.  I have had many items and was always pleased and satisfied.  

The service and portions are a somewhat inconsistent.  It is difficult to predict what experience you might have on any given day.  Some counter servers are nice.  Some are not so nice.  None are outright rude or anything like that. 

They have a drive thru that is pretty quick - I have used it at least 10 times.  The place gets very busy and parking lot is tiny.  I have seen the drive thru line to where you are in the street waiting to get into the parking lot.  And it is often tough to get a spot in the lot.  But you can always park a couple doors down at Bosa Donut and walk up to Fiesta, and then get an apple fritter for dessert ... bonus!"}
{"text":"Quick and tasty....the breakfast burritos are delish...nice people...the green sauce is the best."}
{"text":"Best Quick Mexican Food, in Tempe/Scottsdale so far, love there rolled tacos and just recently tried there Carne California burrito for 4.15 it's cheap too!"}
{"text":"In the office, Fiesta Burrito is aptly known as \"across the street.\"  Kind of like, \"How about across the street?\"  \"Yeah, I could do across the street, today.\"  If I ever said, \"How about Fiesta Burrito?\"  I would get, \"Where's that?\"  Then I would have to say, \"You know, across the street.\"  And the response would be, \"Well, why didn't you say so in the first place.\"

The primary reason we eat at \"across the street\" is because it is convenient - it's across the street.  And in the immortal words of my most quotable co-worker, \"It is fast, cheap, and good -- no questions asked.\"  The part about it being good is debatable.  I could do with a little less greasy.  Fast, no question.  And despite that fact that \"across the street\" charges 60 cents for spicy carrots now, the prices are low.  I like the chorizo plate with a side of sour cream, although I might start branching out as we eat at \"across the street\" way too much, and I'm getting tired of always having the same thing.

At just above a dive, I would call it a hole in the wall, but really, it is just a generic Mexican joint that hides in plain sight.  Even the name is rather plain as no one can seem to remember it.  There is a smallish, generic inside dining area, which is accompanied by a small, generic patio for outside dining.  Some high school students seem to come by for lunch leave.  The staff is polite.  Until they move or I no longer work across the street, I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"This an excellent place to get Mexican fast food! They are fast, it's affordable and it's delicious. The carne asada burritos are the best. It's not too salty like other places can be and they put the perfect amount of guacamole and pico. The breakfast burritos also hit the spot. If you want to sit down, they have great hours but drive thru is super quick too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I go out of my way to come here. I live in ahwatukee but it doesn't matter how late it is I drive here. 90% of the times I order the california burrito and eat it with the amazing salsa verde. OMG I absolutely adore this AUTHENTIC Mexican food. I find it very cheap also.  Try their Horchata!! To die for. yes it is a small place but the drive thru you dont even wait 5 minutes. This is a little shack  but hey! those are the best!!! Been coming here since 2009 and if I could give them 100 stars, I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had the burritos and the tacos, steak, chicken, and pork, and they haven't disappointed yet.  The tortillas have always been fresh and there is a light touch to the spices.  Pass on the golden arches to the left and order the 3-taco combo!"}
{"text":"What an amazing portion, quality and pricing! The Carne asada and guacamole is so good!   A must try!"}
{"text":"Similar to Los Betos - Fiesta is decent inexpensive mexican food. The staff is nice and accommodating. I did have a pretty hilarious conversation with the girl at the counter though... I was trying to order my burrito without onions, and she kept saying \"okay\" and \"yes\" and nodding at everything I said. I would ask her questions and she would say \"yes\" and press buttons on the register. It took me a few minutes to realize she had absolutely no idea what I was saying. 

Aside from that, my burrito wasn't bad... nothing special though. The beans were from a can, the guacamole wasn't fresh (I doubt anything was), everything is cooked in or made of lard, their chips are flavorless and kinda stale, and they are seriously lacking any sort of salsa. They just have the typical generic nameless hot sauce found in these joints. 

As I said - Los Betos... but cleaner and a little better maybe. It's just a place for convenient late-night munchies."}
{"text":"Was exactly what the 3-star rating says, A-ok.

The carne asada burrito was nothing spectacular but the adobada taco was pretty decent.
The food in general was acceptable and nothing too polarizing but it really doesn't hold up to great Mexican like Don Pepe's back home (just as cheap) or in the Bay area.

Its saving grace may be its cheap price but I'll be looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a chorizo and egg burrito, my friend had a carne asada burrito, and I had a medium drink, and it was all less than $10.

That alone makes me like this place.

The fact that the burrito was pretty good sized, and extremely tasty, makes me love this place!

It's not in my neck of the woods, but I may be training in the area for another week. If so, I intend to stop in and try the nachos."}
{"text":"This place is WAY better than you might think it should be...We just moved into the neighborhood and we're routed to Fiesta Burrito for fast, good, inexpensive Mexican food like rolled tacos, burritos and carne asada fries! Try their salsas for sure - the red is good and definitely more traditional hot salsa but the green is super herbaceous, zesty and has great flavor...mix them together for the best of both worlds!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay here, the ingredients are fresh and the steak I got was juicy but a bit too salty. Just don't get the regular sized burrito bowl. They use the small square takeout box with a small spoonful of each ingredient....it's not worth the $8 I paid."}
{"text":"If you like it cheap and fast, Fiesta Burrito just might be for you!  I never eat at any of the 'berto's' places, but I'm not afraid of Fiesta Burrito at all.  In fact, the bean and cheese burrito I had there was a virtual fiesta in my mouth.  Ignore the fact that I'd had 6 vodka/soda's just a tad earlier that night and this will still be a viable review.  

But really, I've been to Fiesta Burrito on a few separate occasions-some sober, some not so much- and I've always enjoyed what I ordered.  Keep in mind I like to play it safe with cheese quesadillas, nachos without meat and of course, the much loved bean and cheese burrito, but the food has always been pretty tasty.

Prices are pretty cheap too, and like another reviewer mentioned, the food is a bit greasy, but it sure is tasty!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. Best carne asada & shredded beef tacos I've had in 6 years living in Arizona. Super nachos are amazing too. Also very good prices. I usually get 2 carne asada tacos / 1 shredded beef taco / and large order of rice. Cost me $14.00 and some change. Just wish they would open a location closer to my new house in North Scottsdale so I could eat there more often"}
{"text":"Very fast service and good quality of food! The meat was well seasoned. The portion sizes was large and well worth the prices. Very glade I found this place. Will be one of my favorite Mexican food spots."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've ever had in Scottsdale and Papago is perfectly near by! The Chimichanga with carne asada is amazing. Cheap and always great service."}
{"text":"I really like Fiesta Burrito. When my Husband suggested we go here, I was a little nervous because it looks a little bit sketchy. When we went inside, it was pretty clean. The staff was really nice and accommodating when I ordered at the window, asking for no cheese and this and that.
I got a Bean Tostada and Bean Taco.

Everything is made fresh, and tastes that way. I really enjoyed the Rice as well. 
Their Pico is really onion heavy, but it balances well with the food. I also like their Green Salsa. 
I will say, I'm not sure if their beans or rice are vegetarian. I'm sort of \"if I don't have to chew it, I don't know it is there\" vegetarian, so enter with caution if you aren't this way.

The meal really didn't feel greasy or too guilty, even though I'm sure it was!"}
{"text":"Not bad food, but lacking an little bit of flavor/spice.... The positive part is that you get a good amount of food at a pretty good price. The service was also good."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burritos I've ever had. Awesome ingredients, cooked to perfection. Delicious horchata. I come here as often as I can. You should too!"}
{"text":"I told the owner there was too much salt in the carne asada meat from time to time. Instead of providing good customer service and talking to me, he said I was the only one that ever complained about it. This is not true. I have at least 2 friends who eat and have the same complaint. Horrible customer service, especially coming from the owner. By the way, I have been going there for 4 or 5 years."}
{"text":"Fiesta Burrito has the best Mexican food in South Scottsdale! I usually use the drive thru. It's quick even when the line is long. Their burritos are amazing along with their SUPER NACHOS!! I highly recommend going to fiesta when your hungry for quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"DUDE! This place is so bomb. I just moved here from LA, and I probably come here twice a week. Carne Asada Burrito and Fries are soooo good. They're quick and the taste is incredible!! Definitely go here and get yourself a good meal!"}
{"text":"When it comes to arizona, everyone knows that filiberto, losbeto and any other buritto shop might be brothers or somehow the same company... but I don't get that feeling when I walk into Fiesta Burrito.

Their breakfast burritos are so good, it's hard to beat especially when it's across the street from Skysong. During Lunch hours this place is always packed. So make sure to time your arrival in a smart manner.

This is also a very good option for the morning after a fun night out as the burritos do a good job of soaking up all the stuff in your body from the night before.

Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of similar type places by far. We used to Los Betos at the end of nights on the town & in a pinch when we didn't want to cook (as there is one quite near). At some point, the quality had dropped far enough that we hit Fiesta Burrito. My sister had been lauding this place for years.

Well, it is not only my favorite drive-thru/semi-fast Mexican food spot, it's one of my favorite value places in town. Cheap great food super quick. It's already kind of a stand by for me & the kids when the Mrs. does a girls night out. Also open quite late which is a major bonus (as both of my other cheap Mexican favorites have limited hours - Carolina's & Rito's).

Their food is excellent. Super tasty, reasonable, quick. Nice clean atmosphere, super friendly staff.

I typically go with the taco combination as they do the deep fried shredded beef tacos that are so yummy. Their carne asada is also brilliant. Great beans. They have a nice salsa bar as well. The Mrs. likes the green & red chile quite well too.

Can't miss with Fiesta Burrito."}
{"text":"Really good! Tasty, clean, professional, friendly... solid sauces... great fixings bar. It's perhaps a little surprising to find them somewhat out of the way but they are way above average for fast food, and a very good value. This place always makes me happy. Thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and though they rush you through ordering, they ultimately are good---well not the other day! I don't know who the girl was in the drive-thru but RUDE and did nothing but blame me for the problem instead of taking responsibility. 

I simply ordered and wanted chips with cheese and beef on them. We asked when ordering if this was ok and she never asked what kind of meat, just said thanks and rushed us to be done. Got to the window and we clarify about the meat...she says it would be carne asada....no thanks. She complained saying that would be normally and I need to specify when I order what I want. Hmmm when could I have as you rushed us. Then I told her I just wanted plain beef. After her \"fixing it\" she comes back saying \"it'll have peppers and onions and all in it is that ok?\" What?! No I said plain! I got annoyed and told her to just forget it because I was over it. Again she complained about us needing to specify what we wanted. Maybe it's called asking what someone wants and you clarifying for me? Traditionally at restaurants that's what happens...aka \"how would you like your eggs?\" \"How would you like that burger cooked?\" Yea. So again I explained exactly what I wanted and said she also hadn't asked us what we actually wanted. She said verbatim \"were not supposed to\". Excuse me what?! WHO and WHY would any order be in place. Why is anyone to KNOW or how what the meat would automatically be. 

It was a let down experience and I left pissed. Though they ended up getting it right, her attitude and lack of responsibility was horrible and I will question going here again. Clean up your customer service! Food maybe good but your attitudes suck!

Ps. 2 stars only bc the food is good. Not GREAT, but good and standard for the cost you pay (reasonable)."}
{"text":"Reliable late night take out fast mexican food. Usually get taquitos and/or a machaca burrito, its good value & the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Little places like this are the best! If you didn't grow up in Arizona you may be freaked out by the actual building Fiesta Burrito is in, but as a native I know these are the best places! I ordered the plan bean and cheese burro for $3 and it was delicious! The service was so fast and the workers were very kind! My mom and I were in the area the next day and I told her she should stop and get a burro so we did! She loved hers too."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of fiasta burrito but when my sister and her gf (she happens to be African American) went in to get something to eat you can tell they felt uncomfortable and made us feel uneasy. They just kept giving altitude and rolling there eyes. At one point we can hear them comment in the back saying racial slurs in spanish since were mexican also. I just cant go back if they are prejudice and homophopic and if thats how they run business then we're jusy going to take our business else where.

Update-went again to get something to drink since it was hot and too see if they changed but guess not
So I talked about fiasta burrito before but damn man dont go at night for drinks. Just went to get a small horchata and a large and the guy end up giving me 2 large which isn't a big deal but then before I took off I noticed one was purple so I went back literally seconds later pretty much went around the restaurant still in there parking lot and the guy was like \"what do you want\"(really man) and I said \"hey man I asked for 2 horchatas and he went on the offense and said \"NO YOU SAID 1 HORCHATA AND 1 JAMAICA LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT\". then I went um no 1st I asked for 1 large and 1 small and you end giving me two large with no receipt which I dont mind but you didn't give two horchatas and then he went on by okay but I need to charge you and I said wth why i didn't ask for that order then he was like fine pull up and he end giving me my drink but with the craziest altitude. I was more shocked then mad like wtf man it was the easiest order ever and I didn't snap at him or get mad. Idk why he was so mad"}
{"text":"Really appreciated finding this spot, with the help of Yelp, while stranded in the area. Yes, it's a basic burrito/taco joint, but the quality of its food is definitely above many of its competitors. 

My first selection was a chicken taco. Didn't really expect much. I was delighted to receive a taco stuffed with shredded white chicken, not the \"are you sure this is chicken?\" mixture you sometimes receive elsewhere. The chicken wasn't really that well seasoned, but you can spice to taste with a salsa bar that is stocked with red sauce, green sauce and veggies. The menu has a lot of variety, much more than the establishment's name would imply. Burritos, tacos, tortas, enchiladas, tostadas, chimichangas, quesadillas... and great combination plates priced mostly around seven dollars. 

The dining room is minimal, in both size and décor, just as it should be. There is a shaded outdoor patio with additional seating.  The staff is friendly and food is quickly prepared. There is also a drive thru. Located near SkySong, Fiesta Burrito is wedged in among some other restaurants, fast food and otherwise. Open for breakfast and late night."}
{"text":"meh.

 I had to shlep over to the new post office just north of McDowell and had read good reviews about this place so I thought I would give a try. 
Used the drive-thru so I can't comment on the cleanliness. Nice tip jar hanging on the drive thru window *eyeroll*. I honestly don't have a problem with tipping. However, do we tip at taco bell? No. Or do we? Yet?
Urg.

The bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty. Their hot sauce was watery and not even close to hot - probably because it was mostly water. I also got their beef taco. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. One bite and it was actually decent, but I was done, full. I wish I would have eaten the taco first and skipped the bean burrito.
We all know you can't save a taco. It becomes a mushy mess - no ones fault but the nature of the taco.

Los Favoritos has them beat by FAR. If you're a fan of Fiesta Burrito, make the drive to LF and give it a try.

Btw, that new Post Office - clusterfuck."}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale this was my go-to Mexican spot. This, along with Los Favoritos, are hands-down the best taquerias Scottsdale has to offer. Whenever I visit these locales I am not looking for some exotic dish or specialties and typically stick to carne asada and breakfast burritos. Fiesta Burrito excels at both. Their beans, tortillas, and green sauce are pretty tasty as well. The rice is pretty standard and just okay. Whether you are looking to satisfy your Mexi-cravings or drunk as a mutha-fuckin' skunk, hit it up! They won't let you down.

Just a note: For all you whiteys (myself included) and transplants who praise the bland, sad-excuse-for-Sonoran-fare of Macayo's, Ajo Als, and the like or the valley's unfortunate taqueria staple, Filibertos, please try this place or Los Favs. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Food is decent and I can survive here as a vegan. I am not extra confident about the hygiene here however. I saw some things that made me wonder. I guess for late night grub and the cheap price, it might be worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint with the classic washed out pictures of what you are going to be eating on the menu board. I ordered the 4 rolled tacos with guac and had a great meal overall.

Expect large portions, good prices and authentic offerings.

With a good Mexican cerveza the experience would have been even better (I guess I have to go for take-out next time to get the cerveza myself)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not fancy, but they have my favorite tacos in AZ (hard-shell tacos are hard to find out here!) 

They're also quick and they have a drive-thru."}
{"text":"I've lived down the road from this place since they opened having never stopped in. I have my excellent go-to Mexican restaurants, so trying new ones isn't something I have to do often. Today, however, that changed when I realized It was 12 am and I had still not eaten dinner. 

After a quick Yelp to determine which restaurants were still open, I settled on Fiesta Burrito bc of the strong reviews. A breakfast burrito is what I craved, and this place delivered. Double bacon, potato, egg, and cheese. It was fast. The bacon was real bacon, unlike some of the burrito joints that fake the bacon w burnt spiral cut ham. The cashier was friendly and made sure i left with enough hot sauce, an absolute necessity in my world. Also, 7$ for a double meat burro was a price I appreciate. 

I'm adding this place to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"The California burrito and chimichanga are the best I've experienced in Arizona so far. 
They also have awesome salsas which I seem to grab way more than I need when I'm there. 
My only complaints are going to be the lack of seating, the length of time it takes to get your food sometimes and the clerk can be extremely rude. 
So I've chosen to get it to go and make sure I'm not on a time restraint when picking up food here. 
Also, the burritos are smaller than the ones I'n used to, but they're cheaper too!"}
{"text":"You want it quick...booom! Taste...well..it  was fast...ka pow!!! YeH!!!good enough for me...be starving....nope.. no where close to new mex chillie. But ya gotta live were you be"}
{"text":"Not impressed, the burritos were small, lukewarm, and sort of bland. I feel like I tasted more tortilla than meat.

I tried the chicken, carnitas, and carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for being walking distance from my office and for having an empty spot next to a warm sunny window. The food is by no means gourmet, but it's filling without that gut rot feeling you get at some fast food Mexican places."}
{"text":"5 stars had they put more rice, but rice portion is generous I'm just a rice eater I want more! Two consecutive meals that I ordered #13 Fish Taco with beans and rice for $7. I love the green sauce that comes with it. I also like how they overflow it with lettuce. I just love it I want it for lunch tomorrow ( I just had it for dinner today)"}
{"text":"Why does this place have such good reviews? We drove through and the order was wrong. No flavor whatsoever. Everything was very very plain. Not impressed. I wouldn't recommend it. I am a bit bummed at the wasted food and money."}
{"text":"Quick, good, reasonably priced. 

Not too spicy, but they do have hot sauce available to add. 

Most plates average about $8.50 and most single entrees are $4-6."}
{"text":"This place kept me coming back for a second time in just a couple of days. Amazing amazing quality they do it right and for a low price you are guaranteed a good meal! AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Had a super delicious shredded beef burrito and rolled tacos.  If I lived nearby I would definitely try every burrito on the menu.  The tortilla was fresh and hot, killer.  Good beans and rice.  The cheese enchilada was OK but not on the same level."}
{"text":"It's got a good chorizo breakfast burrito. If you dine in, it would be nice to have a more convenient salsa selection. If you're taking it to go, you might have your own salsa/hot sauce solution, so that's not a big deal. I like their drive through and customer friendliness."}
{"text":"This is about as bad as Mexican food gets. Honestly, I can't really think of how my meal could have been any worse aside from them just taking a dump on my plate."}
{"text":"OMG, seriously the best Carne Asada burrito I have ever ordered at a neighborhood Mexican food, drive thru style restaurant.  The meat is tender and not fatty, and the burrito is not greasy and heavy.  The portions are more than enough.  The breakfast burritos are also awesome.  In all honesty a $4.00 breakfast burrito will feed my husband and I.  So, if you are not big eater you can definitely share."}
{"text":"I typically love coming here, as it has some of the best mex food, for a great price. Any other day I'd give 5 stars. 

...That was, until just this last visit.  
The service and quality absolutely lacked.
First off, They got my order wrong! Thankfully, they refunded me the extra burrito and gave me the drink i originally ordered instead. The cashier had a sketchy demeanor to him and seemed kinda out of it, maybe he was on something? Idk.
I digress, I arrive home and open my food container only to see that they even messed up my \"no guac\" request! Is this cashier deaf?! Lol.
To make things better, I bite in to my food to find another little extra; a toothpick.

I typically don't review stuff, but this trip literally compelled me to go out of my way to get on yelp and express what happened. The place is great, but tonight sucked. 

2 stars; but because the food is so great, 3."}
