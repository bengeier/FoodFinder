{"text":"FOOD POISONING and unfreindly elderly waitress/cashier.
 The old lady/waitress was very unhospitable and refused to even crack a smile after me greeting her very warmly. We also heard her yelling loudly at the rest of the staff in the kitchen.We felt so sorry for them having to deal with that.The buffet food didn't taste good and didn't have many selections. Rice was dry and looked old. We had a serious case of food poisoning (unbearable stomach pain, diarrhea,vomiting,  you name it) after eating there (all of us!) that lasted more than 3 days! We seriously thought of going to the ER. I wish I read the reviews before going. We would have avoided getting food poisoned during our trip to Pittsburgh. NEVER going back there!"}
{"text":"Although, I only ordered the samosas...they were the BEST I've ever had. Very flavorful, crisp and filled w potatoes and peas. This is a wonderful mom and pop establishment...go and support. Can't wait to try other items on our return visit!!!"}
{"text":"The guy was clipping his nails at the register right there next to the buffet. It was loud and clearly heard from my table. The food was so so at best before I heard the clipper but I can't get past the finger nails now. I recommend that you stay far away from this place. Something very wrong here."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed the food, it was rich flavored food, hot, fresh, and delicious. I think I'm going to pick up food from there whenever it's possible for me.
Thank you guys for this great food."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner buffet with a great selection.
Not too spicy but not bland either. Everything was hot and fresh and tasty. I would recommend this to all."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live, and I wasn't crazy about the restaurant that moved in afterward.  The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing, hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick, I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though, it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!

Anyway, I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star, but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while . I'm not sure what was worse food or service . Never again , the coupon we bought and weren't allowed to use left on the table"}
{"text":"Mediocre  Food  Service and Atmosphere.
Better to stay clear and save your money.  
Judging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.

We experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:

Bland reheated Samosas.
Flavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. 
Barely reheated Naan. 

We traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. 

The loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience."}
{"text":"I ordered food for  pickup and it was pretty bad.Gobhi Manchurian fried rice and it was very bad.I was surprised with the quality of food provided.I would never visit this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Aloo tikki was delicious. Samosa chaat was also great. The chicken curry could have used more curry.  Definitely will order from there again. The delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"I had lunch here, and I was skeptical of the buffet at first. It turned out to be really tasty, though. Lots of variety, good spice level, and the staff kept an eye on it so that nothing sat too long. I'll definitely go back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Basically, biryani is chicken curry with rice and fried rice is loads of vinegar with peacarrotcorn frozen mix with rice and fried chicken with flour, all of which are frozen foods. Be away from this restaurant, as it not only is bad taste but causes health hazard too, as they use frozen foods. 

In the name of God, they don't even deserve avg prices for the oily frozen food served. My order is a throwaway anyway."}
{"text":"I think the quality and flavor of the food keeps me coming back even though the old woman is very unpleasant, I have never been there when there was more than three or four people in the whole restaurant. I don't know how long they could survive and that is unfortunate.  On one occasion I was waited on by a young man who was very friendly and pleasant , where did he go? This place has potential but the old lady must go."}
{"text":"Lunch time...we opted for the menu vs. the buffet for my family's first time indian...I ordered for them, knowing what they would like.

My issues:
Holy Sh!t was it expensive for lunch!!!!
The old woman was NOT nice.  AT ALL.
Gobi Manchurian for an appetizer was small and 12.50! what?????
however, perhaps the best I've ever tasted...I just refuse to ever pay that ever again for that portion.  Crazy.
In addition, each entree was $11-$12 and only came with rice.  I paid $2.50 additional for each order of naan.  Also crazy.
That said...for 4 people, my lunch tab came to $70.  SEVENTY DOLLARS.  For an appetizer, 4 entrees, and naan.  No drinks.
So, I will never be back.  Which is sad, really.

However....the food was damn good.  We had chicken vindaloo, good and spicy, and chicken tikka masala, mild with a good sweet taste.

Hey Namaste....hit me up if you ever work on your prices and customer service....I'll give it another go.  Until then, I will be sticking with Cafe Dahli."}
{"text":"I ordered from here on Grubhub last night and was so impressed. I am a huge Indian food fan so I'm pretty picky when it comes to getting it from restaurants but I was so happy with what I received from Namaste. I ordered Aloo Muttor and Aloo Paratha bread and both were hot, delicious and flavorful when they arrived. I also received a huge portion of rice, coriander and tamarind chutneys, and papadam with my order. Also, it was literally 25 minutes between when I ordered and when the food arrived at my house. Overall, I was so impressed and happy. I will most definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is difficult to find. You need to go through the hotel. Place is OK, simple interior but clean. They have buffet and menu. I went for salad and chicken saag. The taste was good but I bet that it was not chicken."}
{"text":"Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-

I and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party, just one hour before lunch, told that they did not get the \"PANEER/cheese\". They can substitute it for \"MALAI KOFTA\". It was unbelievable that they changed the dish at the last moment requested by my friends as 50% guests were vegetarian and hence need a cheese / \"PANEER\" entree. On the other hand the \"MALAI KOFTA\" was just \"POTATO\" in the gravy. The quality of food in this party was awfully bad. 

This is a humble request to all INDIAN Americans and all NON-INDIAN Americans that please don't throw your money by going to this restaurant. We are not here to misguide you or someone from a competitor restaurant. You can confirm these details with me anytime, I am engineer by profession. I was thinking to host my son's birthday party over here next month but I am lucky to get an experience before hand. I will NEVER NEVER recommend this place EVER."}
{"text":"I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! 

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. 

Erythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? 

Service was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... 

I would return. 

Portions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. all tasted like old food. Hope no one falls sick after eating food here."}
{"text":"Fantastic Chicken Curry. I love ordering takeout from Namaste"}
{"text":"NOTE :  They have moved further North along Banksville Road to the basement of the Days Inn (where Maharaja was for years and then, more recently, Billu's Grill(now closed, obviously.)
It's all of the renovations/new furnishings that Billu's put in (Maharaja was circa 1978-esque decor/furnishings.)
I tried it, today .  Food was better , somehow than it ever was at the prior location .
Very friendly/accomodating staff  .  More centrally-located, now ."}
{"text":"Just to let everyone know, Namaste Indian Restaurant has moved (January 2013) from it's old location in the Banksville Plaza to 1150 Banksville Rd, adjacent to The Days Inn. I've notified Yelp."}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. I ordered chicken curry. Lacking in flavor, no \"curry\", not spicy what so ever, a little lacking in the protein portion, I ended up cooking on a night I didn't want to. I fixed your \"curry\" sauce by adding curry.... Don't be afraid of flavor who ever does the cooking here."}
{"text":"Naan is definitely not indian..... i like it but it's not naan it's more off a domino's garlic bread type of thing"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars...total waste of money. Food was so bad that I threw it in the trash. Hope no one falls sick after eating food here."}
{"text":"Great indian food. Buffet is excellent and reasonable price. Friendly staff. LOve it. Thanks Namaste..."}
{"text":"One of the good things about this place was that it had a very large and varied menu, and it seemed like it would have a very large and good lunch buffet (I went for dinner).  Unfortunately, I found the dinner to be rather pricey considering the food that we received.  I ordered the lamb tikka masala, and it was ok, but the meat was tough, and the sauce was just nothing special.  Copper restaurant is above and beyond a better choice at these prices, plus their chicken tikka masala is one of the best things i have ever put in my mouth."}
{"text":"First off i have no idea what these people are talking about when they speak of and mean old lady. The lady was extremely nice to me. We even had a few laughs while trying to communicate with abit of a langue barrier. The only down side to it was the low spicy flavor. I have a high tolerance spicy heat. She tried to hook me up a big bowl of wet crushed peppers and more powder. And the white rice was a tad dried out but never the less all other items where great."}
{"text":"My mistake that I went to Namaste India with my cousin. 
Pappad were served in the beginning and that was the only moment we could afford a smile! Rest was a complete disaster..

We ordered aloo tikki and \"much recommended\" samosa Chaat!!  Samosa chaat was cold to touch- looked like a heap of poorly cooked samosa.. worse was the RED CHILLI powder used as garnishing ( we asked it to be a bit spicy- our fault) ..that too in plenty... we could have used that amount of red chiili powder for cooking food for some 6-7 people!! Taste was below average...

we could barely think of ordering main course after the initial encounter.. Malai kofta is what we ordered besides daal... Malai Kofta looked like stuffed with samosa!! ( Pun intended) ... bland and tasteless.. NAAN were good ..thin , baked properly...out only consolation... No wonder we left half of the  ordered dishes...

Worth mentioning is the fact that..Kohli's store is adjacent and we saw some samosas there..I wonder if the ones we had at namaste were part of the same deal? 

Please beware of this place- you may end up cursing yourself for your visit later on... as we are doing right now..."}
{"text":"I regularly order takeout from Namaste and am never let down.  The food here is consistently good, the portion sizes are larger than most other Indian restaurants in the area, and the prices are on par with what you would expect from similar restaurants. Don't let the location or allegedly unfriendly old lady (she's actually quite sweet) deter you from dining here--or at least ordering takeout, which is what I primarily do."}
{"text":"This review is based on a private event (70+ people) we hosted here couple weeks ago. The location is within the Day's Inn Premise so Parking is/or shouldn't be an issue. The Restaurant also shares a small section (about 1/3) with the Motel during breakfast.

We spoke to the owners (husband/wife) and they seemed pretty friendly and helpful in meeting our needs for the event. Since I had difficult communicating with them - I made sure to let their daughter (who also manages the restaurant) know about what we have agreed on. One very important part of the agreement was that the restaurant was closed off to public and solely used for the purpose of this particular event. However, once the event started - the owner (wife) wanted to keep a section (booth seating) of the restaurant open to public and would not listen to anything we said. We tried talking to the husband but the wife wouldn't let him respond. Only after I made a phone call to the daughter, the owner (wife) decided to make it a private event.

Besides this initial hiccup, everything went on smooth. We had already picked the number/type of appetizers/entree/dessert, so we knew what were getting.The appetizers were really good with few varieties of vegetarians dish (chat, samosa) along with chicken tandoori and salads with plenty to go around. The entree was equally good. However, some of the curry (including the tika masala) had a peculiar sweet taste to it and not as good as other places. Overall, the crowd was happy with the meal. The service was good and most of the workers were pretty friendly.

Towards the end of the event, I headed to settle the payment for the event but once again we had a slight dispute with the owner (wife) over the remaining balance. But to not ruin the mood of the just concluded successful event - we obliged. We also made a point to tip all the servers.

At about 10:30'ish as we (the organizers) were packing our stuffs (audio systems, decorations etc.) the owner (wife) would rush us and turn off the lights despite booking the venue until 11PM.

In conclusion, I would still recommend this place if you're looking for a place to host an event that includes food. But it's PITA to deal with the owner (wife). I would make sure to have everything in writing no matter how small the detail is."}
{"text":"The service is very attentive. Their buffet has plenty of options and the food is fresh. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and was very disappointed. I have been craving Indian food for a while and decided to go for a chicken tikki dish. What I got was a chicken fajita on a hot plate with onions, bell peppers, carrots. Then a separate bowl of bland sauce-the same sauce that my companion got on her bland food. For $14, I would have at least expected a tortilla to go with it. The naan was really salty and buttery. I also ordered garlic naan and got what even the waiter called \"garlic bread\". The only good thing was the mango lassi. I wish I could be more positive, but I've had better fast food Indian in strip malls."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with a large group of friends.  Oddly enough, we were the only people in the restaurant!  The service was adequate (obviously, as there were no other patrons to distract our server!).  My Chicken Karahi was pretty satisfying, but as this is my only real exposure to Indian food I can't comment how it might compare to other places.  Overall, the experience was good--but it could just as easily have happened at any other Indian restaurant.  I can't fault the restaurant for anything in particular, but they did not do anything to stand out in my mind and make me want to come back.  The food wasn't overly expensive, but I'm left with the feeling that I should have paid less."}
{"text":"I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning, sorry if it should have been taken off the website but you should honor it. I would not pay their full price for it, but with a nice coupon then maybe it could be worth it. The quality of the food was not good enough to outweigh the service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed due the upcoming expansion of Independence Blvd."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The food has a home made feel to it! 

Yes, the old lady seemed rude. but we did not deal with her.  The cook (guy in apron) was very friendly and kept coming back to us to see if we need anything."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"Hard to complain too much about a $7 buffet.   Food wasn't bad,  I've certainly had worse Indian in Pittsburgh.   Limited selection that they don't refill often enough.   Odd atmosphere,  they need some background music or something.  The soap opera on tv just didn't cut it.  They do give you fresh naan bread which is nice, old buffet naan always sucks.  Good if you're in the area and need a cheap lunch but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"I completely disagree with the other reviewer. I love Indian food and Namaste is by far the best in Charlotte. The dinner buffet it expensive at $16.95 per person, but if you're hungry for samosas, tandoori chicken,  tikka masala, daal or great naan bread and much much more, it's the place to go. Most Indian places I've been to in Charlotte aren't spicy enough, but Namaste offers a great variety of spiciness in their dishes. Simply put, it's well worth the price!"}
{"text":"I have just discovered this place, and tried it on two very separate occasions: The menu dinner, and the lunch buffet. I must say, I was quite impressed with both.

Namaste India, unlike many other Indian restaurants in Charlotte, isn't afraid of offering spicy, bold options across its menu.  For dinner, the waiter respected my family's wishes for spicy entrees, and delivered.  The chicken was fresh, the naan was obviously taken out of the oven and onto our tables, and the service was excellent.

The lunch buffet is very affordable - on the weekdays - and I thoroughly recommend it as well.  I am from New Jersey, which is the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars... but it is the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \"thank you\" and \"how are you\" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used, thus my favorite dish, aloo gobi, is never offered..  There sometimes is no rice pudding, and in place of the India staple buffet item, chicken tandoori, the cheaper and less appealing chicken wings are offered.  It is s shame that such a beautiufl, comfortable restaurant space is being wasted.  For a mere $1.01 more, I can receive a spectacular and delicious array of the finest Indian food in the lovely atmosphere of All India, North Craig Street, Oakland, where I receive gracious, personal attention from the owners."}
{"text":"My daughter and I used to eat at this location when it was Mahajara, which we really liked. We wanted to give this place a try. Firstly, the lady wasn't the most hospitable host which is no big deal, just hoping the food would make up for it. The buffet was unimpressive with the selections, not much to choose from at all. Also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless, very disappointing. To make the experience even worse, my daughter experienced an allergic reaction (she has a nut allergy).. No clue what she consumed from the buffet to cause this and I suppose we should have inquired about ingredients in food prep, though she never had such reaction with other Indian buffets we have had at different restaurants in the past. I ended up getting her to the Med Express on 51 in time where she was treated with epinephrine, a steroid and benydryl via an IV.. Terrifying experience and I wanted to make sure I posted this to alert future customers with similar allergies since they was no viewable signage to let consumers know to beware! Needless to say, we will never return!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place \"-5\" stars for its terrible food quality. Oily, greasy and bad taste. All 4 members of our party fell sick, throwing up and/or with a running stomach."}
{"text":"Finally tried Namaste, at Bill F's YERRAA suggestion, and it was pretty rad.

First of all, they have Tandoori vegetables and a Tandoori Paneer dish. This is ridiculously rare, despite it being the awesomest way to cook vegetables ever. 

Secondly, they have the BEST garlic naan I have ever tasted. Seared close to black in places, puffy and light, salty, garlic everywhere, some ghee but not a ton. Better than the best garlic knots you've ever had. 

But the service was kinda weird: our apps went missing, no raita for me, the spice levels on our entrees were switched, kind of a bummer. The waiter that we had, while cool and conversational, wasn't there when we ordered; perhaps that's why things got so garbled, as the hostess who sat us seemed very unsure of herself. The pepper plate that came with our (free!) parathas was overly sweet for my taste, but that didn't stop me from eating a ton of the tomato and onion chutney. 

This place has the potential to be some of the best Punjabi food in Charlotte. I make the distinction because Woodlands does both North and South Indian so well, that its at a whole other level of awesome. If they can iron out the service kinks, Namaste will become my favorite North Indian restaurant and get lots of my money. We'll see!"}
{"text":"Note: Namaste is no longer located in the difficult-to-navigate Banksville Plaza. Instead it has moved to the Days Inn (1150 Banksville Road). 

While the high-quality of their food has not changed as evidence by a recent takeout meal, I felt the decor was a bit gloomy and antiquated (funeral parlor), so much so that I felt as if Robert Irvine would burst in at any moment with his patented golden sledgehammer. 

The matriarch is still as sweet as Golub Jamun to me. She even gave me a free pen with the restaurant's logo on it as I settled up.

P.S. The defunct Billu's Indian Grill was located here before Namaste took it over."}
{"text":"Decided to order their food this evening. Used their website to order. It went through some website called Beyond Menu. Everything seemed fine- made my selection and paid. They called to confirm I would be picking up. So far so good. 

I arrived to get my food but they insisted I still had to pay them. I corrected them saying I had already paid on their website-it said so on the receipt they printed on their computer. They still insisted I had to pay them. So, I pulled out my email invoice- they still didn't believe me. Then I called the Beyond Menu company 12 times before reaching a customer service person who reiterated what I was already telling these people. Oh, and did I mention I also pulled up my credit card account to show them the transaction was currently pending and they still didn't believe me?

Only after the Beyond Menu called the store twice to tell them I had already paid (and a half hour after I entered the store) did they let me take my food with no more than a short \"sorry for the inconvenience\" and a shrug telling me to order by Grubhub next time. 

I get home, happy I was finally able to eat, only to find that my chana bhatura was smashed and I had sauce all over the bag. 

Let's just say I wasn't very happy with my service this evening."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grubhub. The chicken tikka was excellent. Lots of chicken and the sauce was flavorful. Good naan and samosas too. Super quick delivery. Blows the other Indian delivery options in the area away."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low, but there is no call for rudeness.  The old lady should retire.  The young waiter was ok but clearly  scared of the woman.   I went to the dinner buffet at 530 pm, the food was obviously left over from lunch, the rice was so old it was crunchy, all other food was very low quality and mostly cold. I always like to say something nice so the sweet carrot dish was not horrible.  My search for quality Indian food in the 'burgh continues."}
{"text":"Another place I've been going to for years. Anytime anyone comes into town for a visit I take them to Namaste and they love it. Their lunch buffet ($8.99 for Indian and Brazilian food) is a great value, vegetarian-friendly, and almost can't be beat. 


The lineup for the buffet is variable so don't go there on a Wednesday and come back on another Wednesday thinking you will see the same food choices. The collard greens on the Brazilian side are yummy most days, super buttery greasy on other days. The same holds true with the naan on the Indian side. Their mint chutney is my fave in town as well as their samosas. Their gajar ka halwa (carrot pudding) is to die for.

I will say in the last year or so the quality and freshness of the veggies has declined. I know the owner has yet to decide if they are keeping Namaste open past this year so maybe with that knowledge they started lacking in the veggie area. I don't really know but that is my one gripe about my Namaste."}
