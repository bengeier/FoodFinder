{"text":"Stopped in again during Winterfest this year.  I still like the space and the service was good.  But the value is hard to swallow.  The bar bites (appetizers) are pricey ($15-$20) and quite small.  Even if you order one for yourself and don't share, it's really not more than a snack."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a happy hour cocktail prior to meeting a friend for dinner and a Cavs game.   The lounge is located off of the 6th floor lobby of the hotel.  Looks someone's living room (in a good way), lots of comfortable seating and a few seats at the bar.  There were a number of other customers there on a Wednesday night.  The bartender was super nice.  There is a happy hour menu with food and a few cocktails.  I opted for the sangria ($6).   The cocktail was chilled, fruity and very good.  Also served individual portions of bar snacks...spicy snack mix, wasabi peas and almonds.   I didn't order any food, but the selections offered looked tasty (next time, for sure!)."}
{"text":"Very nice place to stop for an afternoon cocktail.  John the bartender took great care of us.  Thanks John!"}
{"text":"Like most hotel bars, the drinks are overpriced and the atmosphere is pretty sterile, but on a crowded night in the city, it's a wonderful semi-secret getaway from the noise. Ritz service, free snacks (OK, built in to the price of your not cheap drink), and a peaceful and comfy retreat."}
{"text":"Went to Film Fest Sunday night and had enough time before our movie for a quick drink. But not enough time to leave Tower City. Options: Hard Rock...uhhh...no. Or?? Drew a blank. Then my wife suggested the Ritz Carlton. Sure, why not? We were directed to the bar just outside of Muse, the Ritz's restaurant, on the sixth floor. What a cool little hideaway this place was! A fireplace, couches,some tables and a small basement sized bar filled the intimate and well appointed( however dated) space. We had two cocktails totalling about 16 bucks and chatted on the couch. The servers were very polite and not judgy like you would expect from a fancy hotel. They offer light noshes if you are so inclined. If this was the first thing I saw leaving my room to venture out onto public square, I would be fooled into thinking downtown was not the desolate carcass that it really is. Way too classy to be in the same building as Footlocker and Sakkio Japan. But I guess the dichotomy of Tower City and the Ritz is what makes it such a unique experience."}
