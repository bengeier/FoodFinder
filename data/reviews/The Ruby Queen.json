{"text":"The food was subpar but the service was horrible!!!
We had a reservation and we're basically told after we had our soup and dumplings that we needed to hurry up and order and get out! The owner (who I think was the owner) was very rude about it all! People were coming in with their own alcohol and pop. They had a very small selection of drinks. It took over 20 minutes for someone to come and ask us if we would like anything to drink and once I was done my water I was never offered anymore or asked if I wanted another drink. I would not recommend this place to anyone. While we were there I witnesses people walk out. 

If you are looking for a great place with great service and even better food and don't mind a little drive The Palace in Strathmore is the best place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicous here! Awesome treatment from the staff and manager. Come here with my family almost all the time. Any type of event we just come here haha. Totally recommend this place for any first time Chinese eaters lol. If there is any left in Calgary."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the family on a recommendation. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. The service we received here was hands down the best service I've ever gotten from a Chinese restaurant. The staff was friendly, hospitable, and very welcoming. The food was above average, so it's better than takeout, but it's not going to blow your mind any time soon."}
{"text":"Ruby Queen is a hidden gem that only those in the know know about. It's not a big restaurant but they serve big 10 course dinners and they do it well!! You're not sitting long waiting for your fresh dishes to come out of the kitchen. The owners run the whole joint so they really care about their patrons. The Peking duck is a must have. Call ahead to book your preset dinner. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, typical fast food kind of Chinese food. The service was good. He accommodated us, some people in our party didn't like the food, he was apologetic and gave some excuses, nothing off the bill or any kind of apology but did throw in a little container of steamed rice. I thought that was nice.

There were some Vietnamese nail salon artists who really liked the place. That's who told us to go there and check it out. It was okay. I didn't think it was anything special but it depends on what you like I guess.

I say if you are desperate or really hungry or both give it a shot."}
