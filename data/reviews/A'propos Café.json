{"text":"I'm so happy that I discovered this restaurant- it's awesome!  A'Propos Cafe is located in Old Montreal and has kind and bubbly staff who offer really great food. The restaurant is spacious, clean, very comfortable and simple. I came here during lunch time and had many options to choose from. They had plenty of specials, a menu that consisted of soups, salads, panini's, pizza and more. They had some Greek and Arab food too! I tried their grilled chicken caesar salad, California panini- it contained: tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, goat cheese & chicken.   Everything was outstanding and made well and fresh. The portions and prices were great. For dessert, I had the crème brulée - the best I've ever had, and café au lait was was really good too. When you order the crème brulée, the chef comes out and burns the top layer at your table; I loved the whole act!  I can't wait until my next visit to A'Propos cafe."}

{"text":"A delightful little cafe/restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal that was perfect on a day when sub-zero temperatures encapsulate the city. My friend and I were roaming around Saint Laurent when we started to feel a bit chilly for our own good. Luckily we were able to find this spot and take a quick warm-up break.  We got two \"bowls\" of mocha and hot chocolate. The chocolate was delectable given how cold it was outside. The cafe plays chill lounge music, has power plugs on the side tables (perfect for recharging your devices that likely died from the cold), and heaters!  The food looked good based on what people got. Our server was a bit quirky but we figured it was the Montreal way. If you're in the area and just need a quick rest break, this is a good place to check out!"}
