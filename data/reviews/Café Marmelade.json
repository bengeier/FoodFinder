{"text":"AMAZING bread! I'll make the two-hour round trip voyage just for the homemade flax bread.  Really friendly workers there, too."}

{"text":"We've stopped by this charming and cute neighbourhood cafe several times now as a family. The new owners, Philippe and Elizabeth, have been quite friendly and go out of their way to make sure we've been comfortable and taken care of each time. For example, we have a son with a severe peanut allergy, and they are quick to point out most things that do not come into any contact with nuts.
Nearly everything in this cafe is homemade daily, including the soups and moist and hearty flax bread that they use in their sandwiches (egg salad with dill is a favourite!). Their baked goods are mouthwatering, including their cinnamon buns and muffins. They also pride themselves on serving organic coffee.
While the selection of items isn't huge and sometimes the items are a bit pricier, everything they have is down-home authentic and made with care and attention. Run, don't walk, to Pointe-Claire village and see what you're missing."}
