{"text":"What a disappointment.

My fiancee and I were in from Chicago to visit my mom and dad, and we dined here in celebration of mom's 60th birthday. She had been here for lunch with her girlfriends and was impressed with the buffet selections.

Dinner, however, was a different story once you get past a decent wine menu. We should have followed the lead of the couple that got up in the middle of their salad selections, complaining to the hostess that there was a piece of plastic in one of their dishes. They didn't come back.

As far as our experience, let's start with the Piatto salad, a house salad that claims to have \"hand-cut mixed greens and vegetables.\" The greens appeared to have been from a bagged salad, and the vegetables were the skinny shredded carrots from said bag along with about two pieces of celery. The salad was also vastly underdressed.

These, unfortunately, were still the highlight of the meal. I ordered the Pork Rib Chop, which was overly soggy from the accompanying mostarda and extremely fatty. While such a chop is undoubtedly going to feature some fatty portions, there was hardly enough good meat to justify its $25 price tag. It also included about six fingerling potatoes that could be better described as fingernails.

My fiancee ordered the Cavatelli with Smoked Salmon, which was an outright disaster. The salmon was not deboned and it was extremely dry. Even more concerning was the rest of the dish, which was absolutely drenched in a watery olive oil, rendering the basil walnut pesto virtually impossible to taste. 

My mother had the Linguine alla Bolognese, which she claimed was fine - though it's rather difficult to screw up such a basic dish. My father's Linguine with Lobster, however, was also extremely disappointing. While I was assuming the \"butter, sherry and touch of cream\" would result in a sumptuous sauce, we instead found mildly buttered linguine with peas. The lobster was plentiful, but didn't complement yet another oily pasta dish where the peas added nothing of significance.

My fiancee, father and I would have preferred to skip dessert, but it was my mother's occasion, and she ordered a slice of Vanilla Cheesecake. It was incredibly dry and denser than any cheesecake should be.

Finally, the service. Our waiter was scarce through the entire meal, and 18% gratuity was added for our party of FOUR. I've never heard of such a thing.

Overall, this was a beautiful location that seemed full of promise. Unfortunately, we'd have been better off celebrating our occasion in the Swenson's Drive-Thru. We won't be back, and hopefully others won't make the mistake we did."}
{"text":"I have to say, the overall experience wasn't bad, but I've enjoyed better food for the same price elsewhere.  

Everything was presented beautifully:  the decor was classy, servers were neat and knowledgeable and appropriately formal, the food was beautiful on the plates.  The view was ok, but we were seated on the down-stream side of the restaurant so it might have been more impressive on the falls-side.  I will add that I was very glad to have arrived before full dark, or we wouldn't have seen anything but our own reflections.  The whole meal took about 2 1/2 hours, and I felt like the service was a little slow; but not excessively so for a formal meal.

Piatto Novo offers a nice selection of martinis, so I ordered one called Angel Food Cake which was excellent.  In retrospect, it would have made a terrific dessert drink.

We shared the Portobello Mushroom appetizer, and enjoyed it  despite the fact that it wasn't heated evenly.

My companion ordered the Caesar salad and said it was pretty good.  I ordered the Piatto mixed greens salad (which was a lot of greens, and a few slivered carrots) and selected the orange vinagrette, which was a mistake.  The dressing was so peppery that I couldn't eat it.  In Piatto Novo's favor, the server noticed and took it off the bill.

Next was the Cavatelli with Smoked Salmon, ordered by my companion.  I didn't try it, but he described that the salmon was completely dried out (like jerky) as if it had been left under a heat lamp for far too long.  

For entrees, we ordered the Filet Mignon and the grilled Opah (one of the evening's specials).  The steak was fantastic - rare when I'd ordered medium, but still melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  it was served with fingerling potatoes and carrots that were perfectly seasoned.  My companion equally enjoyed the Opah.

We splurged and got dessert and coffee.  I chose the Free-Form Apple Tart which was saved from mediocrity by the caramel sauce & my companion selected the Chocolate Fantasia which was also pretty good.

The bill for the meal above and 2 glasses of wine was $150 (not including tip).  If it was all very good, I would say well worth it.  However,  I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped to be with this experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday. We started with some wine and an appetizer.. our server was great when it came to choosing a bottle. Our appetizer was amazing. We got beef tenderloin and highly recommend it. Our entrees were spectacular!! I got the linguini del mar and he got the bolognese. We were extremely happy with our meals. Once it was time for dessert, we got raspberry sorbet. It came with a huge portion and a raspberry glaze w a ton of fresh raspberries. It was so good!! I highly recommend thus place if your looking for a nice place to eat. Views of the gorge are awesome as well. I cannot remember our servers name but she was great. Our only compliant was the old/hard bread.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular ambiance, above average food, but too pricey (it's in the Sheraton, after all).  I would only go here if I had a Groupon."}
{"text":"Don't know why previous diners have rated this place so low.  It is a competent Midwestern hotel dining room with a responsive staff and very nice dishes.  The grilled shrimp was very good, as was the eggplant.  The wine list is widely representative.  The selections we had were very good.  The setting was spectacular.  The rushing water entertained endlessly.  The only problems related to regional preferences.  Too much protein to fiber, insipid white bread (I understand people around here like that) and a tad too much salt.  But for a vacation evening, it can hardly be beat.  This jaded Philadelphian is sold.

I reviewed the other reviews and the complaints were naive at best.  If you want good food you wait for it.  If you are in a rush, go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"A restaurant with high aspirations. Had breakfast, lunch, and dinner there. Pricey, but consistently good. Beware. Service degrades significantly when a large party is going on."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here it was for brunch, and for the money it was terrible.  My wife and I complained and the restaurant mgr gave us a credit to come back.  When we came back a few months later it was even worse.  From the service to the food it's horrible."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Ended up going here because it was on restaurant.com.  

Went here for a little celebratory dinner (just finished residency training).  

We ordered:

1) Grilled calamari
-Prepared beautifully.  I've heard that octopus is best prepared when grilled, and tonight I learned the same holds true for squid.  Very tender.  Served with a sauteed grape tomato/onion mix and drizzled with balsamic reduction.  This was my first great calamari experience and I hope there are more to come!

2) Lobster bisque
-Initially I had some sticker shock because it was kinda pricey (relative to the other items on the menu), but I had to have it.  So worth it.  Creamy, but not coagulated.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Mushroomy, but not too mushroomy.  Lobstery, very lobstery:)  This was big enough for my entree and oh so satisfying.  There was at least 3oz of lobster meat in the crock as well.  The bisque was served with a pastry puff accompaniment, but I didn't really know what to do with it and honestly didn't really notice it as I shoveled lobster creamy yumminess into my mouth.

3) Wild salmon
-Good salmon.  My ball n' chain ordered this so I didn't really try a whole lot of it.  I got an end bite which tasted dry, but he stated the thicker center was cooked perfectly.  This was true wild salmon as well, which is often hard to find in restaurants in our area.  
-Served with perfectly blanched green beans and fingerling potatoes.

5) Side of Brussel's Sprouts with pancetta
-Felt like I needed a veggie with the bisque; very delicious.    

4) Blueberry crumble
-I gotta tell you, there was at least $20 worth of blueberries in there.  My gosh, it was like delicious blueberry jam. 
-Unfortunately, for me, after the extreme decadence of the lobster bisque, this dessert almost tasted healthy to me:)  

We also ordered 1 beer and 2 martinis, the bill came to approximately $85.00 after the $25.00 restaurant.com coupon and 20% gratuity.  In my opinion, this meal was well worth it.

We would definitely go back, either for a formal dinner or if we are just craving some good quality food.  I have a feeling that when I'm pregnant with our first, I will be asking my ball n' chain to pick me up some of their lobster bisque... probably weekly....

We determined that this is one of our favorite restaurants in the greater Cleveland/Akron area (that we have dined in).  It's got a completely different vibe, but Piatto Novo is up there with Johnny's on Fulton."}
{"text":"I had lunch here, and the food was mediocre quality. I've definitely had far better food. I did however enjoy the experience overall, particularly due to the AMAZING view of the river. With that, you're going to end up incurring extra expense on the meals. 

The service was... again, \"bla.\" Nothing to write home about. In my opinion, this place is perfect if you're hoping to have a romantic, relaxing drink overlooking a beautiful scene with your significant other. If you're really hungry for some excellent food and excellent service, go to a local restaurant. My experiences in nearly ALL hotel restaurants have been similar to this one. Overpriced, mediocre food, with a somewhat clueless staff."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Do not get the eggplant. $22 worth of blah! Sent it back and I don't do that! 

Service was very slow.

Stay away on Sunday nights unless you are 65+ plus and like karaoke."}
{"text":"Amazing view . Excellent food and service . The place is excellent to go on dates.  I don't agree with the most of the reviews written for the restaurant. The place is quite underrated for what it offers. For the Cuyahoga region and Cleveland region this should be one of the top 5 restaurants."}
{"text":"We were seated next to large windows with a river view. It was beautiful! I observed that the whole restaurant only had two servers, with two \"bus-boys\" and a runner. The servers appeared to be a little overwhelmed in that medium sized restaurant, but our server was very pleasant when she did attend to us. Our appetizers took a little longer to arrive than we liked but the food was quite tasty and the portions were satisfying. Our entrees were also quite delicious and the portions were quite large. My partner and I both had pasta dishes and there was enough to take home as doggie bags afterward. Overall, for our special occasion, this dining experience was good."}
{"text":"Seems like people aren't too sure about Piatto Novo! I, too, am torn. On one hand, I hated the service; on the other, the food was so damn delicious that I can't possibly imagine writing it off.

Though I live in Cuyahoga Falls, my out-of-town boyfriend bought a night at the Sheraton for his last night visiting. We found a restaurant.com gift certificate for $25 to Piatto Novo, so it seemed perfect!

The view from the Sheraton is, of course, beautiful, recently named AOL City Guide's Most Romantic Restaurant. We snagged a table right near the big windows, overlooking the falls on a snowy night. So pretty!

At first, the service seemed great, very on the ball. Our server was friendly & gave me a couple of tips on food when I asked. But then... he disappeared. He spent about 20 minutes talking to some woman sitting alone at a table a few over from ours, & was quietly chastised by a fellow employee - which was the only thing that spurred him to check on our food & bring us our appetizer! The entrees came about 20 minutes after THAT, & only after I complaine dloudly, \"How long have we *been* here?\" as another server passed by & then chastised him yet again! When our entrees finally came, there were no apologies for the wait or his negligence. I thought of complaining to the manager - the food was so good that the service really mucked up what was otherwise a perfect meal.

Onto the food: We ordered:

- To drink, two glasses of prosecco, $10 apiece. Yum! Can't screw up champagne!

- Appetizer: Grilled calamari, $11 - We hated this, though looking back, I see that the menu did, in fact, say it was grilled, not fried. I can't blame the restaurant for our dislike of grilled calamari! My boyfriend ate it anyway, & I instead ate the cherry tomatoes that garnished it. They were really tasty, cooked perfectly in some sweet sauce.

- My entree: Full-sized linguine balese, $20, which the server told me was the better of the two I was deciding between (the other was linguine with lobster, which reviews seem not to love). Simply put, it was DELICIOUS. I wish the broccoli hadn't been in such large florets - I had to cut them off the stalks before I could begin eating - but the meal was really well done, seasoned perfectly. It was also HUGE, so I took the rest back to the room & refrigerated it overnight for leftovers later. They do, though, offer half0portions of each pasta entree, which is really convenient.

- His entree: Grilled 12-oz. New York strip steak, $38. He wouldn't have gotten this had it not been for our gift card, but he was super-excited to get such a fancy steak! He loved it, though he noted that it wasn't all that much tastier than the steak at, say, Longhorn. It was a little fatty, & there was a couple of inedible bites, but it was cooked to his request (medium-rare) & was eaten in full, except for those gross parts. He also loved the carrots & potatoes it came with, saying he's \"never had vegetables cooked that way before.\"

Bill total was around $125 including tip (restaurant.com includes gratitude) & without our gift card. 

How's THAT for a review? All in all, I'd go back, but I'd hope like hell I got a different server."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Basic and bland hotel based Restaurant that other than a cool view should not be a destination. Time for a new Chef ... Not up to Sheraton standards. 

The Room: This dimly lit space is cantilevered over the Cuyahoga Falls and provides a neat view.  Table sets are basic but clean.

Service: Slow and not particularly friendly. Don't read \"rude\" but just undertrained and in the weeds. I ordered a NY strip, I wonder what temperature it will arrive at?  She didn't ask and I forgot to offer a preference.  

Appetizer: Stuffed peppers. The menu is the basics with no one particularly notable.  I have seen peppers on a few local menus so I thought I would give it a try. Overpowering oregano and a heavily pasted marinara was bazaar.  Spice was good but as a dish didn't really work.  
 
Entrée: Steak.  I have to admit, I travel a ton and I was cautious with the choice.  I was pleasantly surprised. Well seasoned and well cooked ( medium... They got lucky) seasonal veg (broccoli rabe) and carrots were really nice.  It's harder to mess up a really good cut of beef and they didn't."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, Piatto Novo didn't meet expectations.

The great: The setting and the design of the restaurant is spectacular.  Its beautiful.  A modern structure jetting out into the natural setting of the falls.  Heck, I've driven by here 20 times and didn't know there were falls, let alone a place like this.  So my visual needs have been satisfied.

The good: My date and I had good service.  So there ya go.  My emotional needs were satisfied.

The just okay: So the next step is ordering.  It's a basic menu, with what you would expect at a place like this.  I can't judge the steaks, because I only go the steak route at steak houses, but the pork and chicken entrees were just okay.  The beef tenderloin skewer was overcooked beef on a stick, stay clear.  The Piatto salad with red wine vinaigrette was a joke.  It was lettuce, on a plate, with a touch of dressing.  The Chicken Arrosto was definitely tasty, but the potatoes were under the chicken and soggy.  They also had a pork special, which was HUGE, but sometimes you sacrifice flavor with size, and that was the case here.

There are better options, comparatively.  I'm sure you can find something you enjoy, but this place won't be my first choice.  Maybe drinks over the falls then move on."}
{"text":"The food was flavorless, the meat undercooked. The least you can do for $41 a plate is season your food. I know we live in the Midwest, but must you cook like it???  The service, however, was great."}
{"text":"Great buffet and view.   Much different set up than the last time I was there.  Had a wonderful waiter."}
