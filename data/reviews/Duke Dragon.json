{"text":"Great new Hakka Place in Mississauga.  We had take-out chicken pakoras, manchurian chow mien and manchurian chicken.   We also had hot and sour soup, quick tip, add soy sauce and Siracha sauce....so good!! I will definitely be back, it's nice to have a local Hakka place close to south-west Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Chicken Biryani was good. But the Chicken Lollipop was raw & disgusting,wasted my money.

Please make sure you remind them on cooked meat."}
{"text":"Great Indian Hakka food! Tried the manchurian fish and spicy garlic chicken, the food was tasty and the portion was generous."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars if it were solely based on how incredible their chicken pakoras are! Piping hot, perfectly spiced and perfectly crispy. The manchurian egg noodles were decent, the crispy Thai beef was a bit sweet and extremely deep fried (ie super crisp to the point that you can almost not tell it's beef anymore). The goat vindaloo was very well spiced but slightly bitter, maybe a bit heavy on the lime... Also goat was mostly bones with very little meat- the sauce was good though. Decor could be improved- a bit dark/dreary, lacking a warm & inviting vibe. Really friendly and helpful Nepalese waiter. Remember- Chicken pakoras 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! So glad to have found a place for my Indo-Chinese fix. 

This place is awesome, it had the best Chicken Manchurian that I have had in a while and the Chicken Hakka noodles was so good! They had North Indian cuisine as well,  so you can get your butter chicken too. 

I'm usually a little doubtful of a restaurant when the have two different cuisines, I was pretty sure that either the North Indian cuisine or the Chinese would be better and the other would be a flop. But I was wrong, my friends that been to this restaurant before but apparently it had a different name. 

I would definitely try this place again when I'm craving Indo-Chinese. :)

PS: The service was good too!"}
{"text":"I saw the 20% check in offer and that this place was fairly new so I decided to give it a try.  However, I didn't try their Hakka food and decided to try their chicken biryani and I ended up paying $10 tax in for a huge portion.

It wasn't your typical chicken biryani and came with some large pieces of chicken tandoori.  The rice was tasty, slightly oily but it was a huge portion and as for the chicken, there was very little fat and was more than acceptable. 

Overall, while this place didn't blow my socks off, it was decent and I'd go again."}
{"text":"myself and 2 co - workers drive by this place every day for lunch, on our way to another restaurant ,we decided to stop in for lunch . I ordered the Chilli chicken lunch special ..it was mediocre at best ..my buddy ordered a chicken and brocoli dish ...what a disappointment ..only 3 tiny prices of chicken in the dish , we laughed , called over the waiter ...His response was brocoli shrinks ...and apperently chicken shrivels and disappears , SO I dunno what specials or dishes the other reviewers were getting and eating but ours was tiny and sad looking . Any ways the inside is old and dated ugly wood decor ....but if the food were good, you could over look that I guess , but because it's like taking 2 punches to the face ...well you get the picture ...keep driving to the next restaurant . Cheers"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, much better than I expected it to be. Although, I found it a tad too spicy for my liking. 
The decor of the restaurant was more on the darker side, but was pretty good! 
Would probably go back again! :)"}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was not.

We got the chicken lollipop and manchurian paneer. 

The chicken lollipop was spicy and greasy. Nothing special. The manchurian paneer was bland and didn't taste very good.

The washroom was also not clean. It's lights were also off and it was really cold."}
{"text":"What surprising deliciousness! I'd tried a bite outta my friends take away a while back and had decided to try it myself at the next chance. Ordered the basic beginners at a new Hakka (Indo-Chinese) place. Chicken Fried rice and Chicken Manchurian. All told to make it spicy! 

First the restaurant itself basic decor, tad on the darker side but suited.  The service has no complaints.  The guys were very helpful and courteous.  Had my take out ready in under 10 min. 

But to the main stage the food.  It looked and smelled good! The rice itself was well seasoned, a good amount of chicken and a little bit of veggies but mostly the rice was good.  Had a nice texture.  

What surprised me was the chicken. It has been a very very long time since I've had such delicious chicken.  It was super tender, well cooked, great taste.  I literally was making sure I left nothing in the bowl when done. 

Lastly the after effects of the food.  Unlike most Hakka / Chinese places here I visit, after the food I'm left feeling like I need to sit an relax and do nothing for a couple hours..this on the other hand, was perfect.  No issues after, just a hunger for more and disappointment at knowing the food was finished( Def a must visit again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for take out as an ad for it popped up on my yelp page.  I've never had Hakka before but it was really good.  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Nothing special."}
