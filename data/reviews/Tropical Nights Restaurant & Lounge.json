{"text":"The patio is great...very spacious. The music on Friday and Saturday nights is awesome which is one of the only reasons I continue to go back. Their food is okay...nothing special. Customer service really really sucks!

Now for their crappy service...I went one time with a group of 10 and they added the gratuity to my bill which was a complete turn off as our waitress wasn't around half the time and definitely didn't service it. Another time...I went for a late dinner and even though the place wasn't busy no one came over to acknowledge we were there for at least 20 minutes...that is a very long time to be sitting looking around. Lastly, I called 3 weeks ago to order take out on a Friday night the waitress put me on hold twice for at least 5 minutes. I just hung up and called Twilight and ordered my food from there which tasted good. Good for a night of partying because the Dj's play the type of music I like but that's about it! If they had better customer service I would've had a completely different review. They need to make some big improvements."}
{"text":"A great place to hangout with friends for the night. Perfect for casual small parties."}
{"text":"OMG I don't even know where to begin with this place... 
Their food was OK
However the service was so bad... I hated the waitresses... They were so rude considering we brought about 11 people to their place... (It was for my friends birthday)
The waitress went up to the birthday girl and asked if we should bring the cake in!!! Even though they knew who was in charge of the party and who they could have asked regarding the cake (my friend and i) as they were clearly speaking to us regarding dividing the bill and how many people are coming. On top of that they bring the cake so late, as we wanted it after our food... TERRIBLE!!! 
They really need to get new staff members. 
Washroom was gross they really need to clean it up properly or more frequently. 
The only reason why I gave one star is because their pepper sauce was the only positivity in that restaurant! now I know why the place was empty... No good customer service or food... DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Just go to island mix in Pickering or Caribbean wave across the plaza"}
{"text":"I have come to this place on two separate occasions, one for dinner with my husband and one with a friend. I definitely like their lunch specials over their dinner ones. I particularly like the goat curry with roti though the goat seemed small in quantity. The portions for dinner were plentiful. I would say the lo mein was particularly too saucy for my taste and didn't sit well in my stomach afterwards. I prefer Windies over Tropical nights if you want another Caribbean restaurant to eat it in Scarborough. The atmosphere is however lively and their patio is spacious and great for summer weather. Music was a little bit too loud to my liking but my friend who is Guyanese says it's typical of Caribbean restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome patio- great extensive drink and food menu.

I don't want to mention too much but if you are in the mood for a vacation type feeling in the city- hit this place up. Makes you feel like you are in the Island's of Carribean rather than in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Staff are friendly and the food is good. I don't go on Friday or Saturday night cause the crowd gets big and the music loud. I enjoy it for a quick drink in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service here at all!
Been here over an hour, not exaggerating, and not one waitress has come to my table. If I wasn't waiting for my cousin I would have bounced long time ago!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the atmosphere or the food here. Doesn't feel professional and the staff seem to be too laid back."}
{"text":"So I finally get the chance to sit and eat here. The food was great. love the chicken chow mein & the doubles. The place was packed due to a private event and a band that was playing in the patio. The hot sauce was nice too! The waitress that serve me was very helpful with choosing our food and suggesting items from the menu. No drink menu, but the strawberry daquari was nice and sweet. The music is loud but enjoyable. Defiantly will go back. That Friday was very crowded and food took a bit of time to come out but the atmosphere was amazing. Make sure you ask OR CALL ahead of time as suggested by our server. I think that if you are looking for patio other than SCARBOROUGH TOWN CENTER. this one would be the one, they also have their own garden outside which I though was really cool Ill take pictures next time I'm there ! 2 THUMPS UP"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, great patio, and live entertainment all make up a very enjoyable dining experience and keeps me coming back!

Everything is good, but my personal favourites are curry goat, saltfish and bakes, and the Guyanese pepperpot."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They have several Gluten Free options...such as potato/chana curry... Yum"}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful rooftop setting and an indoor seating area but it get quite loud inside. It feels more like a sports bar to me. To being the food was not up to my standards being that everthing was salty which makes you want to drink more water. The cocktails we ordered lack alcohol it felt more like drinking juice than a cocktail. If you're in the mood hangout there your best bet is to do the outdoor bar it is not as loud as inside and u get to enjoy some fresh air while hanging with your friends."}
{"text":"Love their food. Always had it delivered and was always delivered by nice and polite people. The food is good, not too spicy. Big fan of their roti and dhal puri. Their custard dessert is amazing."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice vibe and the waitresses are really friendly and always available to check up to make sure everything is good with you.

I had some fried rice and stir fry beef and chicken and nothing was that great but not bad.

The patio though is amazing and makes you feel like you are in the caribbean.

I would definitely go back just for the patio and appetizers and the drinks are super cheap."}
{"text":"Tropical nights is an old favourite. I'm not usually a fanatic of West Indian food, save and except for when it involves phoulori. Just visited the place after a very long time. Tried out the dalphouri - which was perfectly portion sized and not dry, unlike most dalphouri I've tried in the past - along with their shrimp and potato curry, with also a plate of deliciousness (aka phouri with tamarind sauce). Melt in your mouth goodness. The place itself isn't upscale, and atmosphere reminiscent of a bar instead of a lounge, but overall the food is fantastic and staff are lovely. I should also add that food was delivered quickly."}
