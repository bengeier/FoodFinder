{"text":"Sushi was ok sort of but both me and my wife had stomach issues after eating here. This was our first visit for the location. You can definitely taste that there was a little too much rice wine in their rice prep. Also, place was not comfortable temperature wise, yesterday was 85+ Fahrenheit and it's as if they had the air conditioning turned off. I don't know if we came in on a bad day and they just didn't have proper cooling but if the place was uncomfortably warm, I don't imagine serving raw seafood would be any better. Service was average, no complaints. Dining here again at this point is debatable but unlikely."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend because he was craving sushi. He said the yellow tail and salmon were some of the best he's had. He also raved about the rolls. I'm not as much a sushi fan, but  I did try the Hawaii roll and it wasn't bad to a sushi non-lover. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken and rice bowl. It was a decent portion, but the teriyaki flavor was overpowered by the large amount of pepper they used. Teriyaki is my go-to asian flavor, and I was disappointed it was ruined by the pepper. The dish didn't come with vegetables and I asked the server if I could order a side of veggies. She said that vegetables only came with the dishes and I couldn't order a side of it. I don't think it would have been difficult to cook some extra veggies and charged me a few dollars for it...even though it's not on the menu. Would have been an easy way to make a customer happy."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the happy hour menu is awesome as well. The reason why I'm giving this 3 stars is because our server (blonde hair and tattoos) seemed to be intoxicated. She was slurring and to top it off she reeked of booze. Very disappointed actually. Our normal server was out sick so idk who they got to cover. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"All time favorite sushi place! I get the Vegas roll every time! They also have a awesome baked lobster roll! Sushi comes out at a reasonable time, not too fast not too slow. Service is always perfect! Chefs are always very kind as well! I do not have one negative thing to say about this place. Thank you! We will always come back!"}
{"text":"Their sushi is amazing. The cook was so friendly and handsome. The waitress was very caring."}
{"text":"The sushi is delicious. The service was awesome. We sat outside and I got a chill (it was feb) they moved me right away to be closer to a outside heater and all was good. It's directly across the street from Harkins movie theatre so sitting outside provides a lot of people watching. Only thing I can complain about it is they allow smokers to smoke on the rails of the outside area and its offensive when I'm trying to enjoy a meal. But I guess that's what I get for sitting outside.... Otherwise GREAT GREAT SUSHI!"}
{"text":"We come here weekly. This place is legit all the way around. Awesome service, 50+ sushi rolls and probably the best happy hour around. Awesome patio for outside, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beer from a bottle is all I can vouch for. Don't be deceived by the delicious smell, the spicy edamame is truly just good smelling salt! Maybe a great tool for your next hunting trip!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars at Sumo since we discovered this little gem a little over a year ago. The sushi is fantastic and the service is always amazing. Happy hour selection and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Went here for my Birthday, we was the only people there & we loved it!!! Sat in a quiet booth & had great service. We keep them coming since we was enjoying our stay so well!!"}
{"text":"Ordered sashimi, seaweed salad and the stuffed avocado and everything was amazing. The fresh wasabi was a definite treat!"}
{"text":"Great and fresh sushi one of the best places I've gone too. It is pricey and not sure if they have a happy hour anymore. We ordered the tempura platter which comes with a lot of variety of veggies (asparagus, potato, sweet potato, zucchini etc), shrimp, and krab. We ordered 3 rolls and the fish was really fresh. With the fresh fish like that Im willing to pay the prices. They place is small although not busy. They have a tv that plays Japanese music videos which are awesome to watch they don't play the music. The staff was fine not the best service I've ever received and not the worst she did her job. I will definitely go again. I do wish I knew when they have happy hour because they changed it again."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Service was great. We try a lot of different sushi places. This place is at the top of the list. We will be back."}
{"text":"Cook was so friendly and kind its like I've been here for years! Great service and food! 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"We went for Friday happy hour, which was a good selection and full size rolls.  The prices seem reasonable for a quality sushi place (we have paid more for worse food), and they have a large selection of specialty rolls. Everything we tried was very good, and fresh. You have to try the item at the end of the menu.  I think it was called the \"Happy?\".  It was the most expensive roll on the menu (at $15), but the combination of flavors was incredible.  It seems like a lot of sushi places like you to order all your rolls at the same time  However we like to do sushi one roll at a time, and take our time, and they were very accommodating.  The liquor choices where not at a bar level, but what they list all seem to be call brands (vs. bar brands).  My only real \"complaint\" is they do not have a wine selection.  They basically have a house red (a cab) and a house white (chardonnay).  My only real \"complaint\" is that it would be nice to have a nice bottle of wine to pair with the food."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group. The chef and waitress were both very friendly and amazing. This is the first time I had sushi and I was very impressed. They had a very fresh ingredient list. I will definetly visit again"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Sumo sushi.  I must admit the real reason I come is to watch non-stop Kpop videos while I eat so let's establish that first, I love all things Korean.  It actually makes me sad that they play American pop music instead of Kpop because \"customers didn't like it\" WELL this paying repeat customer does!!! I'll take Big Bang over Justin Bieber anyday...

So the food is decent, they have a good variety of specialty rolls. It makes me laugh when people write comments that the sushi/sashimi tasted \"fishy\". why exactly would people expect raw fish not to taste like fish?????  I've had both sashimi and sushi on several occasions and yes sorry to tell you IT TASTE LIKE FISH and that's why I ordered it! News flash to non-sushi connoisseur it's state law that the fish has to be flash frozen prior to eating to kill any parasites so your not going to get fresh fish unless you live on the coast or move to Asia.

Aside from some drawbacks this place has potential I just hope they fix the minor things (slow service) before they become another victim of arrowhead fountains restaurant closures.  FIGHTING!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi sumo sushi never disappoints! My family has been coming here atleast once a month the past year! Server is excellent, very good with my kids and sushi does take some time because we usually order 4-5 rolls but the quality is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but I liked the weird names for the roles.  They've gotten rid of that."}
{"text":"Great sushi chefs! Owners are great! Beautiful place with chill patio. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch and sushi.. the rice they used is the same as what they put in the bowls. I literally can't pick up a sushi piece because it's falling apart and soggy.. will never go to this particular location ever again."}
{"text":"Sumo sushi was once one of my favorite sushi. I have been going to sumo sushi since they have opened and have seen numerous changes to the menu, quality and prices. The menu selection started off mediocre and nothing special, as the owners took over the menu from the previous owners. I can definitely say their new menu selection is really outstanding! That being said, their prices have gone up and their quality has gone way down. I essentially got gas station sushi for Benihana prices. 

Before ordering I asked what type of Tuna was on the menu. The waiter did not know so she asked the sushi chef. The sushi chef was also clueless so he told the waitress it was regular tuna. I decided on the  yellowtail nigiri and beef udon instead.

My father decided on the salmon and tuna nigiri. The salmon was previously frozen farm raised. If farm raised is your cup of tea, more power to you but I'm not about to pay for that at a sushi restaurant. 

The other fish was mediocre at best. 

My udon had some of the best broth I've had the pleasure of consuming. However my oversized noodles were undercooked (not al dente, raw) and my beef was NY deli thin, which made for a very tough, over cooked beef which was probably a cut from the \"round.\" This was accompanied with over cooked carrots, mushrooms and cabbage. This bowl of soup set me back $15.50. 

My best advice is to find your passion again. Remember, raising prices will not keep you in business. Repeat customers will. I have never seen more than 10 people in your restaurant. Advertise, advertise, advertise. Having good drink specials wouldn't hurt either. Five dollars for a 12 oz bottle of blue moon is a little excessive.

I want the old sumo that I once loved back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Staff treats you like family. Best custom sushi ever. Sushi chef is very kind."}
{"text":"This place was great. Their happy hour menu was very large and not just consisting of the typical roll all over sushi places have. if you branch out of the happy hour then you get this menu of 50 different rolls. i'm sure they have one for everyones needs and wants. The waitress was cute. I only wish they had more wine!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their happy hour is fantastic - $6 shrimp tempura roll, $5.50 spicy tuna roll, $5 sake bombs! We had the la la roll and I don't know roll too and both were delicious. Great portion size. Proximity to the theatre couldn't be better."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often.   We enjoy the environment and the employees are so friendly.   The food is unbelievably delicious.  My fave is thier chicken yakisoba and they know I like it spicy.   Hubby always gets sushi and will only come here for sushi. 
 !!!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight and had some seaweed salad, calamari, a Texas and Oregon roll. Everything was really good and the waitress/hostess had them make the seaweed salad the way I asked, which was pretty cool. Worth checking out if you want some sushi and are in the area."}
{"text":"Was very surprised by this place! My mom and I love stopping for a quick sushi bite and stumbled across this place. We had the mixed tempura, edamame and spicy tuna roll. We were very impressed by all the food. Everything was great, we even decided it was one of our new favorites and happy we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food, real wasabi, actual pickled spicy not dyed pink pickled ginger.  Hard to knock well executed food.  Would definitely come again.  Server was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price and the chef is very friendly. I recommend sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"We liked the sushi. It was creative, fresh and ice cold. My only downside is that it took the kitchen 35 min to serve our appetizer, another 15 min for our sashimi and another 10 for our rolls. Made us late for our movie."}
{"text":"Came here for a cheaper experience, up to expected. Edemame didn't have much salt, server took forever, got vegetarian fried rice and shrimp fried rice... So gross!!, if you want good fried rice go to Ah-So sushi &I steak, 4.00 for a side of rice,and quality food. 



AFTER LEAVING: didn't tip because sadly, poor college students and the service wasn't good, nor food. The server ran out and asked us to never come back because of it!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was okay, good but certainly not the best sushi I've had.  We tried a few different menu items and the general conclusion was bland. Everything could have been kicked up a notch..."}
{"text":"We love trying new restaurants and this one didn't let us down!  We grade sushi rolls 1 through 5 and save a few notes for future visits.  EVERY roll was a 5!!! That has never happened before!  Top notch place, great service, amazing food and good location!"}
