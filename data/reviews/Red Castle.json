{"text":"We went to the Danforth to get Greek food but decided to try expand our horizons with a Mediterranean place. We tried a chicken tagine and a chicken shwarma. Tagine came with fries on top and a good variety of salads. The shwarma was filled with veggies and tasted great. More of a fast-food vibe but cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"Really good big shawarmas. Good price. You get way more for your dollar than liberty or Allie Baba's. Nice guy behind the counter. Packs pitas to your hearts delight. I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"We decided to give the newly opened Red Castle a try and are really glad we did.  The cabbage roll was beautifully spiced, the salad really fresh and the lamb tagine was delicious!  The Danforth was desperate for this place!  Welcome to the hood, Red Castle!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest. Doesn't taste great but not the worst. Thing is, I always have stomach problems after I eat here. Shawarma place on Main and Danforth (Shwarma King, I believe) tastes much better then here!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken, excellent flavour! Everything was great. Service was personable. The potatoes were lovely too"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma from here is amazing! Fully loaded with veg and big portion of chicken for a great price. The only thing is with all the fillings it does weigh quite a bit LOL. This is my favourite place to get shawarma in the city so far!"}
{"text":"Good shawarma, Biggest I ever had. Just Wish They Had Hot Peppers and a (Red) Hot Sauce"}
{"text":"I would suggest spending your money at another establishment.   Chicken Shawarma was dry and cold off the rotisserie.  Salads were terrible and did not have any dressing.   Fattoush salad, cabbage and onions with chicken was extremely dry and hard to eat.  Service was poor and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Just visited this new place a couple of days ago - great service and very tasty shawarma. Pricing is very competitive as well! A welcome addition to Danforth food landscape - will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I walked into the place, very clean, and new. I had the red castle plate which is a mix of different grills, it was a lot of food I could not finish the plate, but it was very delicious. definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Was walking along the Danforth when we came across this place with decent rating and they had a sign out front which said \"2 for 1 Shawarma\". Awesome deal! Or so we thought. The 2 for 1 price is $9.99 but 1 Shawarma is $5.99 without a drink. I didn't mind since the aroma was quite tempting! A couple that came in a bit later was asking about the pricing and both parties seemed to not understand each other. Enough about that, let's get on with the rest of the review!  I haven't come across this place before so it seems to be a bit newer. They had quite a decent menu offering snacks such as grape leaves and hummus. They also offered Shawarmas on a plate, tabbouleh, and different types of meats in a tagine. I got the beef Shawarma. It was decent. It was tasty but not as flavourful as I'd hoped. I am still willing to try other menu items so I'll definitely be going back atleast one more time."}
{"text":"Hands-down, the best falafel I've had in Toronto (and I've had a lot of falafel).  A lot of places serve falafel with indifference to its freshness or quality.  This place is the exception.  The falafel is always freshly pressed and fried and topped with beautifully laid-out fresh  ingredients.  You can tell the staff take great pride in making your food.  To the owner of this restaurant.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The homemade burger is perfection.It's made to order with never frozen meat, charred over the grill to just the right doneness. The spicy sauce, tahini and garlic sauce are added in just the right quantity and the fresh cabbage and grilled onions add a crunchiness. Love it!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this new addition to the Danforth didn't disappoint - everything fresh and the owners are so proud of their food and friendly. Falafels are fried to order (not sitting around to be nuked). Had the hummus, beef shawarma plate with rice. Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the place I just didn't enjoy it. The quality of the food is good, portion size good and service good. For me, it was over seasoned, perhaps that's how middle eastern food is to taste so I can't be critical of that. I like a more natural taste to my food. And for what I had, I found it to be very expensive."}
{"text":"I went to Red Castle today with my girlfriend for lunch and it was absolute disaster. So I ordered a Shawarma (mixed) and French fries. The French fries were amazing but it's the store brought coated kinds so it's not that big of an accomplishment for them. However, the minute I bit my shawarma I pulled out solid clusters of beef fat. One by one, i removed around 8-10 pieces of solid fat which made me lose my appetite. Seriously at one point even tho I think it was the onions, I thought I was chewing on fat from my shawarma. I threw half of it away but luckily my girlfriend didn't eat all the fries. Note: DO NOT ORDER BEEF"}
{"text":"Great value, but average taste.   Stopped by here last night for a quick dinner, but loved the atmosphere and ended up spending almost 2 hours here. It's clean, right in the heart of Danforth, and very inexpensive.   We got the 2 for 1 deal - two shawarmas for $10.99 - which is an amazing deal. They aren't your small shawarmas either, they are the larger ones which usually go for $8-9 each at other restaurants.   In terms of taste, the wasn't bad. I felt like it was a very healthy sandwich, as there are toppings like cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. I was left full and satisfied after eating 1 of the 2 sandwiches.   Overall, it isn't the best tasting shawarma, not by any means. But it's a great value meal for what you get - definitely worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious!! First time ordering from Red Castle and the food was excellent, fresh, arrived hot. Way better then ordering a pizza and cheaper too. Real food and the owner prides himself on customer service. Im so glad we found this place. This is now our new favourite GO TO!! Thank you Red Castle! Side Note: The Vegetarian options are amazing and Im not a vegetarian!! Ordered through Foodora and called to thank them after for the delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a really great place for a nice quick sit down meal.  It has a very clean feel, the service is great, and they open late too.  The menu had many offerings.  Very kind gentlemen running the place.  I ordered the lamb tagine with prunes and it was fall off the bone tender.  The meat was tasty and not too salty, with a lot of flavour. I really enjoyed the way they brought the tagine out in the special tagine pots. The meal came with a salad and an eggplant side dish with dinner rolls.   It would be nice if they swapped the rolls for pita instead.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I eat middle eastern food of all types from time to time and this place gets my vote for the one best overall.   I've been here twice and ordered different things each time. Their shawarma is succulent whether it's beef or chicken. I tried their shish tawouk. It's so tender and well seasoned.Their falafel is only $4 and very decent sized. The falafel ball ingredients seem more fresh than most places I've tried. What makes them stand out is their tagine dishes. This is a clay pot stewed dish which I haven't seen in Toronto before. My eyes are set on their shawarma poutine which I'll try next time.  Reasonable prices and awesome taste makes it a win in my books. I'll definitely visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb shanks. It was bland but also had hints of unpleasant seasoning and marinade."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just Eat and it was pretty good.  Got falafel sandwiches, tabbouleh, potatoes, salad, and french fries.  The falafel, tabbouleh, salad, and french fries were great, but the potatoes were a touch oily.  Next time I'll try their falafel plate so I can sample their rice and other salad dishes."}
{"text":"This place has great food. You can smell it as soon as you walk in. The shawarma is great and made with care. The falafel is formed into balls and deep fried right in front of you unlike other some places.  Prices are reasonable and the menu has some interesting options. No negatives here. Just a great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Friendly service although it's more of a fast food restaurant, they had a clean seating area and offered to clean our table after we paid. The chicken tagine was dry not very flavourful but had came with a lot of chicken which we couldn't finish. It also came with salad, pita, hummus and babaganoush which was tasteful. The shish tawouk was my favourite as the chicken was juicy and it came with two types of salad and garlic dip and the rice which was also flavoured. Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"If you love veggies like I do, you will go nuts in this place. There are so many interesting salad and condiment options for wraps, as well as some hot dishes like chicken and potatoes over rice etc. You can make your own plate with whatever you like, the options are flexible which is a great plus. I don't know what the purple pickled roots are but make sure you try them, they are tasty! Hummus is great, salads are fresh. Nice sitting room. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"They are liars and cowards. I ordered whole wheat sandwiches. But they made mistake and used white bread. I sent them my pic of the white bread sandwiches. They insisted that their whole wheat looked white.  It is absolutely white bread. The color difference bw white and whole wheat is obvious.  Making a mistake is not a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. Is it such a big deal to admit it and apologize? But they are toi coward to admit it! Pathetically coward!"}
{"text":"I went with some co-workers to the red castle and ended up trying Lamb Shank. I was surprised to see a nice selection of salad and sauces to complement the Lamb Shank. I would highly recommend it. Also, someone ended up getting a shawarma sandwich and I was amazed at how big it was. So some pretty good value for the sandwich. Overall I am very pleased and would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The place is fairly new, being a year old. Serves up Mediterranean dishes, specifically Moroccan. Has a cafeteria feel to it. Food is fresh. Cabbage salads are really good. My plate scores 3.7/5 because the shish tawouk skewers were bland. Adding spices to them would have made the chicken much more flavourful. Otherwise, the chicken was tender and the rice, fries and sides were good.  Place is clean. Tables require upkeep though with two people working, it can be hard to maintain especially when one's shift is about to end. Nonetheless, service was relatively quick. 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Really enjoy the shawarmas - staff are friendly, good place for kids - a welcome addition to the neighbor hood."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I was feeling adventurous (as usual) and had the SHWARMA POUTINE. Oh wow. Its was something else. It was next level and only be described as HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. This is totally my new favorite food! I am in love with Red Castle. The food is absolutely divine and the prices are great as well. So worth it! I'm so glad that this place opened up! I'll see you soon Red Castle. :)"}
{"text":"Omg! food so good...staff so sweet...but food sooo good. I'm a very picky eater so its often very hard for me to find a place i like.. i tend to drift from bad experience to another. Yesterday I stopped at the red castle and had the Kofta plate, I kinda wanted to try other things but i never ate there before so i started with something safe and it was goooood mmm mmm good. don't let the display at the front fool you..its all made fresh. The experience was so authentic as i have lived in the middle east and know true middle eastern hospitality..try this place and you will see for yourself."}
{"text":"It's a 3.5 for me. I think they should put more spice on their food. I ordered the lamb tangine, it's very tender but it's missing something. Not the flavor thag I'm expecting. Salad was great though and very colorful. Nice food presentation. The place is neat, maybe because it's fairly new. We got our meal pretty fast so that counts."}
{"text":"I came in since I saw all the great reviews and honestly I don't think I would come back.  First off, I ordered a grilled veggie plate and took over 40 minutes to make it.  I don't think it takes 40 minutes to grill some veggies especially if the place isn't busy.  Also the food was okay. Nothing special. I've been to other medditeranean places that were better."}
