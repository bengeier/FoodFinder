{"text":"This place is a complete waste of your time and money. I had to make a stop in this shopping center for an errand this evening (2/16/16) and I happened to be craving a turkey sub (which is more like a weekly craving). 

I grew up in New Jersey and there were plenty of Blimpie locations to be found up there. Naively, I decided to stop in and get a chance to reminisce. mistake. BIG MISTAKE. When I walked in, I was taken aback by a strange odor. It smelled musty or just like the place had not been aired out completely. I was greeted by the girl behind the counter, however, when I walked up to the counter I noticed that most of the veggies and toppings looked like they had been sitting out all day. The lettuce had a slight brown color and the tomatoes were completely limp. The green peppers looked like they may have been sitting out for at least two days. 

This mistake is on me because I could have easily walked right out when I saw the toppings but I figured I was already in there so I may as well see it all the way through. I only ordered a regular size turkey & provolone sub which came to $5.57 (with tax). Unsurprisingly, the sub tasted stale and was a complete waste of my money. 

If you do find yourself in the area, continue driving down N.Tryon for another minute. Turn into the Kohl's shopping center and enjoy a delicious and freshly-made sub at Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I was on lunch debating between Jimmy Johns and the new Blimpie's location, and decided to give Blimpie's a try. The bread was lacking in flavor and the lettuce was brown. They also skimp on the meat and cheese.  Two bites in my soggy sandwich and I had to throw it away and head over to Jimmy Johns. The interior is quite drab as well. Spend your lunch money elsewhere!

Conveniently there are a few 5 star reviews on here from users who only have 1 review... for Blimpies. Suspicious???"}
