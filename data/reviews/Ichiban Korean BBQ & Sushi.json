{"text":"Ichiban has quickly become one of my favorite places for great food.  My work-mates and I go there at least twice a week for lunch.  Although the name implies Japanese, the owners are local Korean folk who are extremely friendly.  The food is made by them fresh, so you know it's authentic.  So what if their English is broken and hard to understand.  When it comes to the other International language, the language of food, it's easy to understand, and what they're dishin' out translates to \"deliciousness\" in my stomach!  I haven't tried their sushi but their traditional Korean fare is excellent- banchan (side dishes) with home made kimchi, kalbi (beef ribs), yoo ka jang spicy soup, seafood soon du bu (seafood spicy soup) are all at the top of my list.  The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly.  I haven't been there in the evening but my friend Suejin highly recommends it as she's spent many an evening there, happily drinking soju and sake while tabletop-grilling kalbi.  And if you know Sue like I know Sue, you know she's one tough Korean cookie to please, and Sue is always pleased when she's at Ichiban."}
{"text":"This is where the Koreans go for Korean food - so go figure. The food is always freshly made to the perfect taste. I'm a frequent goer and find out they're consistent - not like some restaurants one day it's good, the other is totally different. In the Valley, this is the closest to what you'll get from the Korean Towns in Metro cities like LA or NY. Very nice staff, and pocket-friendly ($) too. Highly recommended."}
