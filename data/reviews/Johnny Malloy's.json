{"text":"Great place to watch a sporting event.  Kinda lame place to just hang out though.  Usually pretty doushy folk hang out there..."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the opening browns game because they have a patio.  There was one waitress working the outside patio, which would be fine if she was even partially competent. Screwed up drink orders, screwed up orders, screwed up checks.  Our food was brought out and we were never brought silverware, napkins, or ketchup.  We went and got our own because our waitress never came back.  We were at the bar for close to 2 and a half hours and I think she came to the table 3 times.  On top of the horrible service it was one of the most over done burgers I've had.  Food was awful and the service was awful, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The awesome burger and pizza specials served up by Johnny Malloy's Lakewood owner Tim O'Malley and crew are both affordable and outstanding! A place where people will know your name if you are a regular, very nice and old fashioned in that type of way.   Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is occasional kitchen inconsistency.  Sincerely,  http://www.daviddalka.com/createvalue/"}
{"text":"a blast from the past - wings and beer. sunday nights.    and their mashed potatoes pizza.  sounds gross?   you have to try it."}
{"text":"P DUB is so right.......the worst place to go if you ain't a meathead.  are all the malloy's like that??"}
{"text":"Free apps are put out weekdays during happy hour. Free pizza. For real, foks. It is definitely a step or two above neighboring McCarthy's, but it is still a Hambone and Hooknasty Haven. I usually end up sneaking out the door after telling some creeper that I was going to restroom. Then I run over to the Drink where I find my friends who probably were doing the same thing.   It is pretty cool for what it is, a pick-up bar for young white, mid-twenties west side kids."}
{"text":"Johnny Malloys is a place you wanna stop by if you have ever neem to a Yard House then this is one place that it will remind you of during the day the music is normal but at around 5 to 7pm the Noise level and the Music starts to get louder. I had a Burger which was kinda like a breakfast burger it was so good not like the Brunch burger at Applebees this is something that you have to try and its real good.      Make sure you have several options and you have back up meals because one of the things i notice was the menu was outdated and really old so a lot of things did not exist any more so be sure to ask your server before you order what they have and what they don't.      If you see something or not comfortable about something during your visit just speek up and say something to the staff or ask to speak with a manager. If your waiter says i am sorry are manager is not available or not on duty that is uncalled for and their has to always be a manager on duty."}
{"text":"Atmosphere-wise, this is a typical suburban strip mall bar.  HOWEVER, food-wise, I was really impressed.  Having not had a grill all summer long, I've been jonesing for a true piece of grilled chicken.  Much to my surprise, Johnny Malloy's has an AWESOME BBQ chicken sandwich.  It tastes like a piece of grilled chicken because it was actually put on a grill (hard to find in Cleveland), the sauce is tangy and delicious, and it's served on a soft bun.  So yummy.  I know it seems weird to crow so positively about a chicken sandwich, but you wouldn't believe how many bars I've been to lately that claim to offer a grilled chicken sandwich, only to find out it's pan fried..."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day with a friend as they were advertising $0.25 wings, and these weren't mini-wings being offered.  They have a decent amount of beers to choose from, and there's not a sight line in the place with a TV screen to view the game."}
{"text":"Well they used to be good!  Sad to say it but if you make pizza, either sauce or crust needs to be good. On this visit, the crust was bland and sauce had no taste! Even the wings were coated with parmesan but not much garlic. Kind of tasted like they were cooked twice.   They were training a new girl, so the service was slow. The bill took forever and a day to get there after adding for the check. The only advantage was at $3 for a 25 oz bud light takes awhile to drink.   There are better pizza places. Maybe they'll get better again. But didn't look good now."}
{"text":"I used to love to come to this place but over the years it has gone way down hill. Don't waste your time here, there's a lot better places down the street."}
{"text":"Being a Bears fan in a city where we're far and few, finding places to watch my team is tricky. Malloy's has the Ticket and it's my only reason to go there. The pizza is ok but everything is so freaking expensive for what it is (the $4 giant domestic beers during Browns games are alright). $8.99 for 10 wings, almost $10 for a small pizza (and over $1 for each topping), etc. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, friendly locals, HOT bartender. Woo woo Jessica!   Fun place to have a drink and some food on a cold night. If I lived in Strongsville, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not even enter the parking lot here.  We decided to stope here last week to catch one of our favorite bands.  We encountered the worst bar service I can ever recall.  The restrooms were more resemblance of a pig sty than a dining establishment.  The sound quality would have to improve to suck.  I have to question why this place has not been shut down  for health code violations, they must be paying off the local officials.  So if you are looking for a serious case of E. coli this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It's all right. The pizza is actually pretty good, and not as expensive as another reviewing commented. Also, another reviewer commented that when she orders their pizza, it comes piping hot---what's wrong with that?! Open the box and let it cool down if you think it's too hot. I would rather have that than a cold pizza I have to throw in the microwave. I have never gotten a bad pizza from them, and my boyfriend loves it. If you keep ordering it, it must not be that bad.  When you sit at the bar, it does take quite a while for someone to greet you and start taking your drink order. There have been times when I have had to flag a bartender down while they were just standing there talking to their friends so I could get a drink. They still have the 0.35 cent wings, which is a pretty good deal--they just require you to order an alcholic beverage with it, which most people ususally do anyway. I love boneless wings, but lately when I have been ordering them, they kind of taste like they weren't defrosted enough before they were thrown into the fryer, or maybe it's just nto quality meat. Who knows. It's still a deal that other places aren't beating, and I love boneless buffalo wings.  The patio they have is actually really nice. You seat yourself, and there typically isn't that many people in it, so the noise level is low. It is extremely dark in the inside bar area. The DJ that plays there really isn't that good, and when he starts the music is extremely loud. Too loud. Lots of TVs though, so it's good to watch sports there. This place isn't my first choice when going out, but when I decide to go otu last minute or want a pizza, this is usually where I go."}
{"text":"Poor food high priced and terrible service.been there once would never go back.will tell anyone i know i wouldn't even park in there parking lot.ok terry o you must work there i can tell."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and have a few beers. Nice size bar with lots of seating options. Looks like a fun place to come with a group of pals. The bartenders were friendly and attentive - reasonable prices too.  Pizza looked good, but I never came here hungry."}
{"text":"Back to original owner putting some TLC into the place.  New paint job, lighting, beer selection and specials.  Like what I'm seeing here."}
{"text":"Another punch palace. I have seen so many fights at this generic sports bar. It is part of the evil triangle of bars on Detroit (McCarthy's, Malloys, Riviera). The place is not terrible it is just that the people who go here on the weekends are. At around midnight there is a shift of the McCarthy's and Malloys crowds. In a drunken haze, people finally realize that where they are is not that great. They graze across the street only to find that the bar is almost identical to the last. It is mostly a young crowd with new college graduates and tough guys. It is a good place to go during the week. The happy hour is generous, free pizza with beer purchase."}
{"text":"Noooo!!!!!  Not again!    Please God...open up another pizza shop near my boyfriends apartment that stays open after 10pm.  I mean, I can start volunteering at soup kitchens or something?  Another late night pizza place...that's all I ask!    I hate Geppeto's.  They give stuff away for free all the time...you know why?  Because that's what it's worth.  Nothing dollars.    The pizza is flavorless although, wait...no...it has flavor.  The flavor of disappointment.  The flavor that you're wasting your life away watching another bad Netflix and you're having to call for pizza delivery because there is nothing in the fridge, every kitchen is closed at 10pm, and you didn't eat dinner yet.  Got that?  Gepetto's tastes like FAIL.    I can't tell you how many times I've had Gepetto's pizza.  Every time I yell out \"Nooo...not again!\" so the neighbors downstairs hear me.  Every single darned time, it comes, piping hot.  This strange circular piece of dry sour-dough with bland red \"sauce\" and some pepperoni on, canned mushrooms and olives.  I could make a better pizza with a piece of paper and some coloring markers.    So last night we went to Johnny Malloys only because were weren't watching the time, 10pm rolled by and every kitchen is closed except Johnny Malloy's/Gepetto's.  So we go to Johnny Malloys.  The bar area feels like a sauna, complete with old man B.O.  So we sit on the side by the open windows.  Sit and sit and sit.  A Waitress comes by.  We sit and sit.  Fifteen minutes go by and we walk out the door.  So you'd think I'd be in the clear, huh?  No.  Everyone else closed.  So when I was out walking the dog, what's my boyfriend do?  Turn the knife in my heart and order Gepettos!  Noooo!!!  Gepetto's is gross...but I ate it because I was hungry."}
