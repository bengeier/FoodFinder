{"text":"Great location, updated, safe, nice room.  Tons of restaurants you can walk to or hop across the street to.  This is my new Charlotte go-to spot."}
{"text":"We used our holiday inn rewards to stay here. We had an excellent experience. Our room was upgraded to a gorgeous a suite. The hotel and room were very clean, and the staff was professional, friendly, and helpful! I'd stay here again anytime!"}
{"text":"Do not stay here. Awful. As though it's not shabby enough with the slowest \"service\" in the daytime, a never-ending emergency alarm starts going off at 430  AM. False Alarm."}
{"text":"Great hotel to stay.  I was here for business trip in September, 2014 -  second week.  Every thing was good, very nice staff.  great complementary break fast and evening snacks.  Free shuttle service!! I really enjoyed my stay and i would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Beautifully updated, d√©cor, clean room, comfy white bedding! GREAT staff!    I was disappointed there was no free breakfast buffet, but free coffee is available and breakfast for purchase.  Peaceful setting hidden from the main road ways."}
{"text":"Stayed here over night for an Iron Maiden concert the place is clean, friendly, the breakfast wasnt all that great really and the coffee was sort of bad, they had shuttle service options already at check in to save you time and I liked that alot, I would stay here again."}
{"text":"10 out of 24 mini bulbs in one elevator are out.  TV in the room mysteriously overheats and shuts off.  No complimentary breakfast and a $10 charge for a microwave and mini fridge in the room, but \"we serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the hotel restaurant.\"  The list goes on and on and on.  The little things matter, right?  Well, these are sort of big things.  The ironic part is that there is a highly visible sign in the elevator explaining the customer survey and that \"100%\" is what guests should put for their level of satisfaction.  This Holiday Inn is like a prowling cougar at the hotel bar - friendly (the staff), well worn (the rooms), and probably will lead to an expensive, regrettable night at the hotel."}
{"text":"Hair on the sheets, hair on the pillows, hair inside the pillows, hair on the floor, hair on the walls.  Hair.  Lots of it.  And it's not mine.  Did I mention there's hair everywhere?"}
{"text":"The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was spot on to the pictures and reviews from the web. My only complaints were having to pay for breakfast and the other guests. The hotel was highly occupied by tons of youth, and on my floor they kept running up and down the halls at 11 o'clock at night! Couldn't get to sleep right away because of all of the noise!"}
{"text":"Nicely appointed standard Holiday Inn.  Close to UNCC.  Breakfast buffet was well stocked and clean.  Nice bar in lobby.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Watch out for the transportation driver.  He will price gouge you for things. It's cheaper to do uber. Unless you agree to terms and service don't fall for extra charges. It may work on drunk girls not those who don't pay attention. Not for people who do.  Go ahead and retire"}
{"text":"Got a deal on Priceline for a couple of night here. They honored my request for a King Room and we also put in a remodeled room.  Microwave/fridge, new bathroom, tons of pillows on the bed.  All of the employees we talked to were very helpful.  Great value for a stay in North Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here to visit on business for two days. Got a pretty sweat deal for an executive guest room. So private you need your keycard just to use the elavator to reach the floor (made me feel special).   Checkin was pretty easy, the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the front desk attendant had horrible writing, so my room number look like it ended with 4 when infact it was 8. I accidentally was trying to get into the wrong room...then I heard someone coming to the door so I walked away to guess my room. Eeek!!! Stranger Danger!!  The room itself was pretty nice, free waters in the fridge, some luxury candy, comfy king bed. The free fitness facility was good so I could recover from the free chocolate. The coffee was cheapo-depo, generic hotel brand stuff. No tea (I'm Persian so I gotta have my tea!!)    Overall impression, hotel was very nice and clean. Room was in perfect order. If you are staying for a few days, this is a great value, if it were going to be a week or more, I would search for something a little nicer since there are numerous other hotels nearby. Can't beat the value though if you don't have unlimited funds!"}
{"text":"Make sure you're ready for NASCAR! This Hotel is as close as you may want to be from The Charlotte Motor Speedway. Get your Motor running. The staff and management are on a roll."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our stay (checked in on Saturday and checked out Wednesday) Azeb and Naomi at the front desk out going kind and very helpful!!! Thida in the restaurant is a very sweet lady!!! You'll enjoy your stay no doubt... everything is is very clean and a wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start. First off, this was not our hotel of choice. We booked the Hilton across the street but they overbooked and gave away our room. But this review is not about that. So, moving on to this... Let me see the first thing that happened is that there was a dirty plate right by our door, the first indication something was really wrong. The room inside, at first glance, seemed clean. But then I walked into the bathroom and find hair in the shower. It makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets!!  My husband went to the lobby, complained and they gave us a new room. They said it was an upgrade in their executive floors. Well, I don't know what was the upgrade because it was the exact same room. And so again, I have to wonder if they charge more for the rooms on these floors and  no one is the wiser, it is the exact same room, different layout but the same room! Aside from the fact that it was the same room as the first, this one seems to be clean, which at this point it's all I ask and why they get one start. Oh and if the dirty plate by the door and the hair on the shower wasn't enough, there were dirty plates on the table in front of the elevator of the second floor."}
{"text":"Stayed here on March 9, 2015.  The staff was very friendly at check in and the outside is very neat and clean.  The overall appearance is newer, and has been remodeled in the last 5 or so years.  The area has many restaurants that are close which makes this an ideal spot."}
{"text":"Second time I've stayed in this area, and this hotel was better than the last. It's very nice and clean, and the location can't be beat. Only 10 minutes from the race track and within walking distance of many places to eat."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was completely prepared for the worst when I got here, since the average review for this place was about 2 stars.  My flight landed in the morning, and I called to see if checking in early would be an option. It wasn't. I should have a shot around 1:30pm, though.  Okay, cool..I'll find something to do for 4 hours. So I drop in at 2:30pm--surely they have ONE clean non-smoking room ready, right??   No....they don't. I'm a little annoyed at this point, but the girl behind the desk can't really do anything about it, so I walk back to my car and sleep for an hour....then finally, success. There's a $20(?) deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week. We'll see. If you've read my other reviews, I NEVER have great luck with these \"deposits.\"  About the room: -It's not new. But it's not old, either.  -There's a tube tv circa 1999, no fridge OR microwave OR coffee machine. Those things you'll have to specifically request (for a fee!).  -The walls? Terribly, terribly thin. I'm nervous about going to sleep tonight....and waking up in the morning. -Couple of hairs floating around the room. The bed, the lamp shade...and the shower wall was COVERED in them. Speaking of the bathroom... -Not cleaned. At all. Somebody's draws were on the door (I took a pic). The aforementioned hairs all over the shower wall. And there's no way in the world they could've cleaned that bathtub....it definitely hasn't seen any kind of cleaner in a while. The draws on the door were enough for me; I showered with a towel on the tub floor cuz I just didnt want to touch anything in there.  You'd think as long as they took to get me a room here, the room would be sparkling! Now I'm starting to think all they did was make the bed, fold some towels, and move on.  I really wanna just leave here and sleep somewhere else, but I already paid for the room. I'm mad at myself for going through Priceline...the cheaper rate I got is not worth the hassle this place has been.   Don't do it."}
{"text":"Pretty unremarkable Holiday Inn. Club level room is locked when not open, so no free drinks from there.  Otherwise standard room.  No accessibility to local area by walking, however, with very few crosswalks to get to other places.  Very attentive staff, and clean updated rooms."}
{"text":"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times. This past time was no different.  Hotel seems to be up to date, always clean, the breakfast is hot, fresh and good, parking lot is well lit, convenient to several shops, restaurants, highway etc. They have a bar but it closes at 12:00AM, in my opinion they should extend the hours. Over all a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Great value for a low cost. Close proximity to I-85 and UNC Charlotte. Stopped in to rest during a cross-country move, using a 16ft rental truck. Parking lot had ample space to park. Clean hotel, great open lobby bar. The hotel seems situated within a commericial office park, so Target and pharmacies are within a 5-10 min drive. Chinese Buffet, Japanese Hibachi, Chilis, and TGI Friday restaurants all within walking distance.  4 stars for the $9.95 breakfast buffet, which is the scrambled egg, bacon, sausage; fruit, and packaged cereal standard fare would you could normally get for free at most other Holiday Inn locations. Not even omelets made to go. They gave me a 50% off coupon as an IHG Gold member, but the breakfast is still not worth the price."}
{"text":"Got a deal on priceline.. Recently renovated rooms it seemed... Spacious king size bed with fridge, microwave and lg tv.. Nice shower and bathroom.. Front desk staff super friendly and nice.. Pleasent surprise for the cost.. Some construction downstairs but it didnt bother us a bit"}
