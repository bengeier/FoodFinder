{"text":"My dad and I came here for breakfast.  I got the hot chocolate with whipped cream on top and smiled like a kid the whole time I drank it.  Hands-down, the grits were the best I've ever had in my life !  Lots of butter in them.  Don't even tell me the calories, don't want to know. I got the scrambled eggs with turkey bacon.  The bacon was excellent.  The pancakes were thick and fluffy.  There was so much food I couldn't eat it all. Dad complained about paying extra for tomatoes, but he's from a small place in Indiana and doesn't understand city life.  Lol"}
{"text":"Stop by after a Christmas party on a Saturday night; the place was jamming!  As most places like this on a Saturday late night it was packed.  Every seat cushion filled and the jukebox blaring some \"ol' skool\" seventies soul!  People who come here looking for a Maitre d'Hotel, check that at the door.  Here your going to get a wait staff who dance, call you sweetheart and try to keep up with the huge influx of late orders.  What do you think you going to get from a late night diner.  I can tell you what you should get at a late night diner.  From this one get the French toast!  It is unbelievable!  Made from fresh challah bread it's soft and gooey like hot caramel!  Did I mention it was large?  Oh my, you know it's homemade from the size of the slices!  I ate mine without syrup, because it was so good I simply forgot about it!  Going back tonight to get the shrimp and grits!  See ya there at Midnight or later!"}
{"text":"Ate a delicious big breakfast here. Food was warm and nicely prepared. Clean environment and friendly staff. The only thing that turned me off was a tall black male staff member chewing on food as be serviced customers. It's not a good message to customers. I'm in food service.  If you eat go to employee section."}
{"text":"The chicken was awesome and the Coconut crunch French toast was perfect be prepared for a while to be seated it's always packed on the weekends and late night"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! But definitely not getting a full 5 stars because the service sucked. I asked for sweet tea, never got it. I had to use my friends spoon to eat my food because I was never brought silverware. And I would've asked for it, however we never got checked on. My water stayed empty. We asked for the checks, and waited 30 minutes before the waitress came back to even take the checks. And she had to be REMINDED to come get our cards to run them. Pretty much the worst service ever."}
{"text":"When people started commenting, \"you know the names and shifts of the staff?\" I should have taken it as a hint that I go here too often. And yet, the hashbrowns keep me coming back for more. Oh, I've had other menu items too and have never been disappointed (the veggie burger is a favorite, and the specials are usually a good call). But dangit, when it comes down to it, I just love a good breakfast.   And in a city that can get awfully caught up in frills, this place is about as frill-less as you can get. Straightforward, simple and cheap.  Why four stars? The servers can sometimes get overwhelmed. Ultimately that doesn't bother me that much in a place like this, though. It's the sort of joint where imperfection just makes it more endearing."}
{"text":"We were there for breakfast. I had the waffles nothing to write home about. I make better waffles at home with Aunt Jemima mix.  Husband order pancakes eggs sausages well over 9 dollars for that. He did  not even finish his pancakes and thats normally his favorite.    Enjoyed the interior.. but the food lack in taste and overprice.  Took forever to get the food too.  Perhaps since they are still new.  Management will work out the problems.  Overprice foods. Would not being going there again."}
{"text":"This will probably be our next go to diner. We just moved to the Charlotte area and are huge diner people. Prices were very reasonable and our food was great. My husband ordered the corn beef slam and I ordered the firecracker shrimp salad. I wasn't a huge fan of the creamy Parmesan dressing but if you like Caesar dressing then this is the dressing for you. We went in at 2:30pm on a Wednesday and were seated right away. Also, it's open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast today , I had the midnight breakfast platter . Had a mimosa , it wasn't all that great but then again this is a diner . My meal was decent and my server was friendly ."}
{"text":"The french toast is excellent, real thick cut bacon, and its 24 hours! I'm a native Charlottean back in town from Atlanta. I hoped something better than Landmark would one day be added to all the new nightlife. This is that hope. I didn't find the food compromised by the diner vibe at all. The challah was authentic & real maple syrup aren't exactly low brow. My suggestion: they have fried chicken AND waffles on the menu...but not together. What's that oversight about?"}
{"text":"The Midnight Diner is a great choice for inexpensive comfort food and breakfast anytime. The fried chicken is especially good and I love the shrimp & grits. No wine though - only beer & liquor - kinda weird!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and I think it's fair to say that the diner is consistently yummy.  Each time the service has been good and the food has been exactly as a bright silver diner's food should. It's the perfect place for a nightcap, a \"morning after\" breakfast or even a quick lunch. A word of advice, try the mac-n-cheese. I'm confident the recipe was borrowed from someone's grandmother."}
{"text":"Very interesting diner, really does seem like nothing has changed since these types of diners were THE thing. The place is crowded and parking is pretty rough. The overall cleanliness is pretty poor but not horrible.   Service was pretty slow but nothing absurd.   Food was very good for diner food, however I'll say it's usually expected to be over fed at a diner...  This is not the case here. Serving sizes are pretty small."}
{"text":"Stopped in after attending an event uptown. We waited just a few moments to be seated at nice cozy corner booth. The place had a wide variety of customers which I truly enjoyed.   I had the chicken and waffles although wasn't the best I've had but not the worse. The chicken had been sitting for a bit as it was certainly not hot. Next time I will request fresh chicken. My dw had chicken dinner with greens and mashed potatoes. She enjoyed it except for the chicken was cold.   My ds(7) & dd(9) had the pancakes and enjoyed them but how can you go wrong with pancakes if you are in the mood.   We will go back again & I will make a special request for fresh chicken if I choose to get it next time. The prices were very fair and my family of 4 left with a 32 dollar bill. Not bad."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to the dinner. Ive never been disapointed the food is always good..This time my food was served cold. My husbands was sreved just right. I let the waitress know and she took my plate back and told me they were making a fresh order.I sat and watched my husband eat his food from begining to end. Mean while I sat and waited. Finally my food came out. I told the waitress it should be free. She told tha manager or supervisor what I said and when we recieved the bill 2.00 was deducted from the bill. I requested to speak to the person in charge about the situation and she took her time getting over to our table. I told her my food should be free since there was a problem with my order. She said to me that all she can do is take off 2.00. I told her that was poor customer service and she looked at me like I was crazy. I will be calling the diner and speaking to someone in upper management. Im sure they would like to know what happend. Losing customers is not an option for them."}
{"text":"Good after hours spot! I usually go around 2am on the weekend after hanging out at the epicenter. The food is okay, but the people watching is hilarious. FYI, the crowd can get a little rough."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are ON POINT!!!! Service with a smile and very courteous! This is one of my favorite get a way spots!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Saturday morning. This place was busy for its small size but our group of 7 only had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated. Our server, Chauney, was full of personality, very attentive, joked around with us, and we just loved her. We are in town for a bachelorette party and Chauney really catered to the bride. The food is amazing, southern comfort food. I had the French toast and it was awesome! Overall, cute little traditional diner and would definitely recommend Chauney!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted this to be great. It was not.   The good:  - Cool place, great look, wonderful authentic feel  - The story of the diner presented in the vestibule, very cool  - The location is awesome, and it has parking  - French fries are thick steak fries and tasted great   The Bad: Everything else.  - Service started with \"I just got triple sat so I'll do what I can\" and went down hill from there to \"this is why I hate when they run my food for me\".  - mac and cheese is baked style with congealed cheese. Probably good when first made but not when served. Ate like leftovers from church picnic  - Philly Cheese steak had hard bread, very greasy, wrapped in paper then cut and served. You are forced to remove this very sloppy paper in order to eat  - \"Smothered\" hash browns are hash browns with 2 slices of American Cheese put on plate and stuck in melter, the meal served on same blazing hot plate. The worst hash brown I have ever experienced  - Chili on Chili Dog very chili powder tasting with no other balancing flavors  - Burger comes in same wrapped paper. Not as sloppy as cheese steak, but still not a fun way to eat a burger   I will try this again only because I love diners and really want this place to be what it can be. We need a good diner in Charlotte. As of right now, we still don't have one. Maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed Charlotte foodie I had to try out the midnight diner. Our server was awesome. My only concern for this restaurant is that it could be a little cleaner. One of my pet peeves when I go out to eat is when there is food all over the seat when I go to sit down. The seat was sticky with syrup and crumbs. I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious. I would definitely go back just for that!"}
{"text":"Been here two times today first and my last food is good but the new waitress with a attitude throwing food at u don't sit well with me."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work...nice atmosphere and staff.  I ordered a waffle with cheese eggs and a side of bacon.  Waffle was good.  Eggs and bacon were not.  Bacon seemed very old and was tough."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is terrible. Got kicked out for wanting to place a to go order. About 2 am on 5/14/15 there was a line waiting to to sit, like usual. So I walked past the line to the inside and to the register, as i usuallly do, to place a to go order. I have \"skipped\" the line several times before to place a to go order bc there is no need to to wait in line if ur not waiting to be seated. All the while i had called ahead to place my to go order  and was placed on hold. I was still waiting on Hold on the phone as I approached the register to place my to go order. I was approached by 3 officers and was told to leave the facility and that I needed to wait at the end of the long line  to place a to go order. I was extremely upset but I went to the end of the line anyway and called back about 39 times. After the 40th time I called someone finally picked up and I asked for a supervisor or  corporate number. I was told there was no corporate number and then i was hung up on. Terrible service wouldn't recommend going here unless you were desperate for food."}
{"text":"Food, Service, Atmosphere tied for AWFUL! Blaring music Adele? BBD? Hip/Hop? in contrast to rock and roll theme tacky and annoying.  Asked to turn down, cranked up again before we left.  Server disinterested, beyond rude( walked away abruptly when a concern over food quality was expressed) zero listenening skills or attention span.   3burger/fries ordered, no way meat is ground fresh, over cooked , tough and similar to jerky in texture to dry to taste if seasoned.  Hand cut fries, limp, underseasoned, cold, why bother?  Staff seemed more consumed and concerened with their inner circle than actual customers.  I felt sorry for the line of people entering when we left.  Like us maybe they just didn't know better.  One of the few times I would never go back.  First impressions: horrible."}
{"text":"When restaurants and stores put out banners that say \"Best (fill in the blank) I am usually disappointed when I try it. Well, let me tell you I was not disappointed at this place who boasts the best chicken and waffles--I haven't had chicken and waffles (together) anywhere else in Charlotte but I have had chicken and I have had waffles in Charlotte and let me tell you I haven't found any that are better than Midnight Diner. Maybe it's the combination but its freakin' delicious. One of my friends got the same and a side of mac and cheese (gooey cheesiness, could use a little more flavor though) and she loved hers too! We were in C&W heaven. Our waitress was supernice, checked on us regularly and told us the truth when we asked questions about the menu (i.e. are the shrimp big or little in the shrimp and grits...LOL).  As I looked around the diner, everyone else seemed to be enjoying their meals too. While I can't visit toooo often I know that when I do I will be in for a treat. For some reason, I don't think they have anything bad on their menu. I hope they don't prove me wrong.   Oh and how great is it that they are open 24 hours--a definite need in Uptown. Yum-O."}
{"text":"To start off, I absolutely love this place. I live in downtown so this is such a convenient place to grab food after working late. It's exceptional diner food! I'm wary about ordering veggie burgers, but it's actually pretty good. But what keeps me coming back are the scattered hasbrowns! With a side of toast and scrambled eggs of course, and its under $4! My only qualm is if you're getting food to go, check it first, sometimes the guys in the back don't pay as much attention to the order. If you're headed there past 11pm definitely say whats up to Maria, you can't miss her!"}
{"text":"One of the few places open late night in Charlotte to dine in besides a pizza joint. I found this place on Yelp and people raved about the shrimp and grits so I wanted to find out what is all about. I must say it really lives up to the hype. It's made to order served in a large soup bowl and a biscuit to sop up the rest of your sauce. Grits were creamy and savory delicious. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. When I was done I wanted to lick the bowl so I didn't waste any of it. But I didn't because I'm in a public establishment.  The place looks like a classic diner, long a and narrow but plenty of seating. Even after midnight the place was pretty busy. The servers were very nice and attentive. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As diners go, I think that this is a very serviceable and decent place to go.  I think that might seem like damning with faint praise, but I really mean it.  Actually I'd give it a 4 stars for the breakfast (ate there a year ago and really loved the MIdnight Diner special).  Had the famed chicken and waffles, and while I'd give the chicken wings a definite 4-5 stars (so flavorful, so crispy, so moist!) I thought the waffle was \"meh\" and the side of broccoli I got (to be healthy) was also fine--plain steamed broccoli.  And the hash browns this time around were a bit soggy (a year go they were crisp and delicious--maybe the cook was off on this round).  My husband had the BLT and coffee and said it was good.  Cousin had the seasonal fruit--which was your basic melon/grapes/pineapple combo and the chicken soup (which she said was good but on the salty side).  I'm willing to give them another try--maybe they'll get another star next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate waiting in lines for a seat at a restaurant but I'm glad my partner made me do it. Great food friendly staff really a fun experience."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the world that I would stand in line for over 1hr.   FOOD WAS GREAT @ 2 AM. I got the Midnight Special with chicken wings.. the French Toast was great..and the grits...oh my..If someone wants to buy me a Christmas present get me a bowl of grits from Midnight Diner. No lie.. I ate the best grits in the universe.  Best part was the waitress Angela yelling..\"If you have been here over 2hrs and your ticket is on the table..you ain't gotta go home but you got to get the hell out of here!\""}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because it needs a huge makeover. The servers do not make sure to clean the seating area after customers have left before seating someone else. It's trash on the floors and you have to bring it to their attention to sweep it up. The food is very good though!!"}
{"text":"The first thing I think of when I hear Midnight Diner is, \"MMM! Grits!!!!\" Their grits are incredible! Whatever I order whether it's the Veggie Omelette (delicious), the Chicken & Waffles (yummy!), or the San Bernardino (yes!), I get grits on the side.   So you know the Shrimp & Grits is an absolute winner in my book.  Every time my mom visits, she asks about this place. I try to spread the Charlotte eatery love by taking her to different places when she comes, but I know it is her absolute favorite."}
{"text":"As one of the only eateries within walking distance of my location, MD was slightly above average. Ordered the Midnight Special - two eggs, choice of grits or hash browns, 4 different meats and 2 pancakes (subbed a waffle for $1$)  Pluses - Breakfast served all day. Service was good, not too much, not too little. Coffee served in large, heavy duty mug. Food (with the exception of the bacon) was cooked properly and served hot and relatively quickly.   Minuses - bacon was undercooked and rubbery. Waffle was good but unremarkable. No idea why there's a dollar surcharge to swap out. No sugar substitute on table. 50s music (while appreciated) was waaay too loud. The single $ rating is misleading. Kinda pricey. Can get the same meal with equal quality at a Waffle House for $5 less. For a short order motif, the broad \"no substitution\" policy is puzzling  Bottom line - if you're in the area, a decent place to dine. Will try the non-breakfast fare another day"}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Fun atmosphere. Open all day and all night. Yes, go here for the food and for the jump back in time."}
{"text":"The Bubba is delicious. Has a little bit of everything for breakfast. I will return. Seems like my review is a little short. But I think I got my message across with the first sentence."}
{"text":"You know you have to try a place when your waitress at another (very nice) restaurant recommends it and tells you their shrimp and grits are better than the place you're at. She was right. Shrimp and grits were $9.99 and cooked fresh when I placed the order. They were the best I've ever had - great texture, creamy and with a Creole sauce and jumbo shrimp. They were served with a huge, also excellent, biscuit.   Our waitress was friendly and efficient. She checked in to make sure I liked the food and offered to pack up the leftovers, send me off with more lemonade, etc. All of the staff seemed pretty sharp and customers were a good and fun mix of groups of friends plus families.   This is walking distance of the convention center; maybe a half mile from NASCAR."}
{"text":"Awe man the shrimp and grits is heavenly...  Also the fried chicken with collard greens and macaroni and cheese is addicting.."}
{"text":"All was well and good until we saw a giant roach crawl across the floor as we ordered, to which the waitress grabbed a napkin and caught him with then put it in the trash can. She apologized and said they had just sprayed and he must have been a stray. Um, okay?!?  We decide to stay despite this because my wife really wanted shrimp and grits and had read that theirs were good.   Food comes... My burger had literally the nastiest looking shredded lettuce which smelled like it was turning and was a lovely pale yellow/green color and the tomato had the hard stem included in the center.  Completely inappropriate for a sandwich of my kind. I try to make the best of it and just dissect the burger and rebuild it. I squeeze some ketchup out for my hash browns and the taste was so foul I just couldn't bare to eat them. The ketchup was in one of those red picnic bottles and obviously had been refilled over and over again, and never cleaned out, because the ketchup tasted old and thick-- just plain bad.  We will NOT be back!   I suggest Eddies Place or The Diamond instead if you are in the mood for delicioua diner food along with a clean establishment and quality service."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place, but I continue to eat here often due to its proximity to my house (right across the street). There are certain things that they do very well, Chicken and Waffles, Shrimp and Grits, and breakfast. These are the only things that I have had here and they have all been exceptional (expect one time, see below)  You know whats coming now. Sometimes the service is spotty. Everyone is always very nice, but they seem weeded all the time! I once was sitting at the bar and stared at my food in the window for like 10 mins. When I eventually asked the manager to pass it over, it was mostly cold.   That aside, I think that the Diner filled a much needed void in downtown Charlotte and I will continue to be a cautious customer."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles.  Well worth the wait for the food!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible. Had to go out my way to get more water and to order dessert. Food was also overpriced."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it!!!! The food is great and the waitresses are so happy and friendly, they messed up my sons order and fixed it quickly and gave us free cake!! Will surely go Again!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, like home cooked food. Always open, so perfect after a night of drinking or post night shift. Good sized portions. Ask for Luke he is the best waiter there, always on top of things."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast diner in Charlotte. While there are lunch/ dinner options I know my go entrée is the shrimp and grits. I have never been steered wrong there! If you plan to go after a night out, the wait will be horrendous but the food is definitely worth the wait. The booths are very spacious and good for groups. The staff is overall friendly  (unless dealing with impatient, intoxicated people during the late night hours which is understandable). If you are not from Charlotte then this is a place you can't overlook on your visit."}
{"text":"I've frequented this dive for breakfast, lunch, and , dinner!  Lets get down to the point.. Fried chicken, corn beef hash, hash browns, waffle, biscuit sandwich, chicken sandwich Have all been out of hand. I am now a fan of grits thanks to this place.. And what better than a beer with your chicken n waffles.  Dont come here if your looking to watch your weight because you will be disappointed and come on yelp and write a bad review, ruining it for potential patrons. When you visit MD go in with an open mind and a appetite. I can then guarantee you will leave with a smile from ear to ear. Oh yea and the waiters are great!"}
{"text":"I came here on a late night/early morning 3am munchie trip. Dear lord am I glad that I did. At 3am my biscuit was soft and buttery, my food hot and fresh and my server friendly. Yes there was a group of cop cars surrounding the place because some of the crowd had gotten into a fight and had taken it outside. But that doesn't reflect on the restaurant, the customers maybe. Anyway, I had two eggs over medium, hash browns and sausage with the afore mentioned biscuit. The hashbrowns were my least favorite, a little to greasy, and not really crisp enough, the eggs were cooked well, but the sausage stole the show. Link sausage might I add. Juicy, crisp outside, perfectly seasoned little links from heaven. I'm not a big meat lover, but I devoured all 3 links and dared the hubby to try to steal a piece. All in all, even with the somewhat rowdy crowd, I will be returning. My food was served quickly, the decor was cool and funky and the food was good. In need of a late night bite? Stop by the midnight diner, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the diner, and the food is great. The issue for me is there general manager.eddie south, he has no relationship with his employees, he's not hands on at all, he comes in and looks around like he's afraid to eat from the diner, he want even shake your hand, I don't know if that's racist or just down right disrespectful. He's definitely not a hands on type of manager. He works all his employees to the bone,yet he's never there to help pick up the slack! To Eddie south your a hell of a general manager!"}
{"text":"We just had wonderful breakfast at the Midnight Diner! This place was REALLY busy & the wait staff was moving! Our server, Tammy, was super friendly & gave us the \"low-down\" on how to eat the local cuisine. She was very attentive to our needs & really wanted us to enjoy our experience at the diner-she was a sweetheart. Good food too!"}
{"text":"Fish San was really good. Mac n cheese just like moms."}
{"text":"The Midnight Diner is amazing me and my dad went there for lunch one although it can be very busy at times it has great food. Also there milkshake machine was down when I went there and they made me a milkshake by hand"}
{"text":"I'm from the north so diners are kind of our specialty. They got the diner part right and it's nice to have a late night option, but the night I went here I was kind of scared for my life. Cops everywhere both inside and out, and the people going there to eat were pretty abrasive. Food wasn't bad, it's just your typical diner food. I guess it's a good after bars/clubs place."}
{"text":"You can expect a wait if you visit this small but popular diner. I'm happy to report that the Shrimp n' Grits dish was worth the wait. Creamy  grits are paired with shrimp covered in flavorful creole sauce. You'll feel satisfied and eager to explore other popular dishes."}
{"text":"While their food is quite filling anytime of the day; the staff could be more efficient and accurate. I agree with one of the reviews here, I've been here 5 times and every single time I go(all evenings-around 9pm-2am), there is a number of staff taking smoke break right outside of the restaurant. I don't like breaking through a barrier of smoke just to go to the entrance nor do I like having the smell cling from such a short encounter. Sometimes the host is nowhere to be found so the servers just sweeps you off your feet to their section when eyed upon.   DON'T EVEN think about doing carry out orders either, it's never accurate and when you try to see if your order is correct by opening your to-go boxes by checkout, you get a slap down saying that \"you don't need to check it, I made sure everything is in there.\" BALLS. I've had spaghetti without the house salad it is suppose to come with, no dressings, no sausage...the side items never made it either. They have a pretty clear sign that once you step out with your order, they are not responsible for missing items. CAN A SISTER PHYSICALLY CHECK IF HER ORDER IS RIGHT BEFORE SHE PAYS? WITHOUT NO FALSE ASSURANCE?   While I'm done with being bitter, I would love to thank the wonderful cooks and chefs. You guys make my tummy happy.  Their fried chicken is crispy and just right. French toast is enough to explode your abdomen on half orders. Tea is southern sweet. Grits are wonderfully buttery and creamy. Make sure when you order a breakfast sandwich, check if it's biscuit or sandwich bread. We were bummed when we got bread. Shrimp and grits, spaghetti hits the spot if you're \"hangry\". Can't pledge for the burgers since it's been dry(patty) and bland the last two times I've tried it.    If you're ever hungry late at night, try midnight diner. It's a miss or hit on the menu but give it a try. Some of the servers are to adore but some could use a good pair of boots up their donk."}
{"text":"We love midnight diner! Great food, better service and what tops it all off in my book? It was CLEAN!"}
{"text":"Well, it's no WaHo, but as everyone here seems to reiterate, it IS right down the street...  With some friends in town this weekend, after a night of carousing, we were looking for a basic breakfast place and decided to walk down to Midnight Diner to check out the fare.  I have to say, I'm not as impressed/delighted with old-timey-style diners as maybe I'm supposed to be... they always seem a little too affected for my taste.  The good thing is that because of the family clientele Midnight Diner seems to attract (at least on a Sunday morning), it seemed like a relatively clean place; the bad thing is that it's kind of sterile.  That said, the breakfast food was good - standard breakfast food, but they didn't eff anything up.  The portions were gigantic and left us all feeling like little round butterballs that had to be rolled home through Southend.  My biggest contention?  Price.  This may look like an old school, old-timey diner from the outside, but when you look at their breakfast prices, you realize it's just another \"Uptown\" Charlotte, Super Charlotte People flytrap.  $9 for a basic breakfast combo?  Well, OK.  To each her own."}
{"text":"I would have never tried this place had my niece (NC resident) not brought my son and I here after our afternoon of shopping.   The chicken and waffles are VERY GOOD. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and moist the Belgian waffle was. No joke. I didn't use any utensils because I just wanted the \"finger lickin' good\" affect after I tasted my first bite.   The chicken wings are probably one of the best I've had. Simple down home cookin' is what this meal reminded me of. Traysel took good care of us too!   This SoCal girl will definitely be back the next time she is in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Now this is my kind of a place! Well worth the 3 block walk from the conference center to a 24/7 diner with the best grits I have ever had in my life. Stopped in for jambalaya for lunch and went back the next morning for a 5:30 breakfast called \"The Bubba\" - wow - large biscuit smothered with cheddar scrambled eggs then smothered with sausage gravy, three links and grits."}
{"text":"Late night food option. Great service for drunks. Try the grilled cheese all the way."}
{"text":"Five out of five stars because we had the best breakfast in Charlotte!  We had great service from Parry but, the whole staff was so happy!  Great great!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner in all the cities in which I've lived.  Number one, they serve alcohol which is fantastic and number two, the solid diner fare is accompanied by some of the friendliest staff I've met.  There is one waitress who puts on old school funk and sings like a pro--I love it when she's there.  It can get a bit crowded and loud, but it's a crossroads of life in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Back when I used to drink like a fish, I ended up here at the end of the night or early the next afternoon many times. In a drunken stupor or in the early stages of a hangover, I want the grease cure and anything that is bad for me. The food is probably fit for consumption sober as well.  This is a comfort food zone & its best to put all thoughts of counting calories out of your pretty little head & replace them with thoughts of chicken and waffles. Yes, just like everyone else who has eaten here, I've had the chicken & waffles.  This is THE meal to sop up a night's debauchery & it's just awesome all around. I'm a waffle purist and don't go for all that fruit and circuses on a waffle. Why mess with perfection? I mean if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But if you want all that shit on your waffle, they have it. Gotta be making stuff complicated.   A huge Belgian waffle with a side of 3 fried crispy chicken wings.  The waffle is light yet slightly firm(as it should be). Nothing worse than a waffle that is as soft and floppy as a pancake. If I wanted a pancake, I'd get a pancake. Lookin at you free breakfast at Hampton Inn.  If that doesn't sound good to you, then I don't know what to tell you. Get a salad? Find a place with linens & pay too much? One of those two.  The fried chicken could be some of the best in Charlotte. Once upon a time, some friends & I split a whole fried chicken meal in the wee hours of the morning with friends. After spending too much at the bars, it works out perfectly divided 4 ways since we are cheap & broke at that point. Chicken quartered, fresh and fried, always hot & never greasy. Food here doesn't sit under some heat lamp for 15 minuted before making it to your table. What's up with places like that? Bring it already.  Served with two sides, the mac & cheese is superior. And it was served with made from scratch biscuits.  All the other diner favorites are available. Deli sandwiches, omelettes, grits, etc. But weren't you listening?! Just get the chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"Three times and out! Though their food is great, their customer service absolutely SUCKS and they really could care less if you dine there or not. First, we stood on a Saturday night for more than 45 minutes while they refused to seat anyone due to short staff in the kitchen (though several people were allowed to skip the line altogether and walk right in to be served, go figure). They then passed out cards to go to another diner in the Epicenter. Giving them another chance due to their close proximity to my work, I called in an order for pick up only to arrive to find no one ever put it in. This last chance I just attempted to call in an order and was told I needed to call in closer to the time of pick up. Im done."}
{"text":"Latosha and Leroy were awesome! Great service. Food was hot and great sense of humor."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits! Chicken and waffles! Philly cheese steak! OMG you have to go multiple times and try everything on the menu. It gets crowded on the weekends between 10p-3a so make sure you're ready to wait in line. The owner yells across the restaurant if your just sitting after you've eaten to let everyone know that she has ppl waiting to be seated so GET OUT! overall a great place to grab a bite"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for my fraternity's convention and tried this place. Had the Carolina Burger. Very tasty with the cole slaw, chili, and cheese. Not a combo I would have thought would be as good add it was. Fries came out cold but our waitress Corie replaced them right away. Cori was really helpful and made good recommendations on the menu items. She was on point with the service too.  Bruhs had the chicken and waffles and they looked really good. They cleaned the plate so I would say they enjoyed it. Would deff recommend this place."}
{"text":"Is this true?  I ordered a PLAIN burger and it was brought out the total opposite and the manager came to our table to say \"that a new law was discovered \"today\", that if an order is delivered to a table, the customer has to pay for it regardless\"!!!  On top of that, the server came back to our table and wanted to argue with me to tell me that I DID NOT order it plain.  She was very rude and was shaking her head at me....with that being said, I asked for the burger \"to go\" and came home and gave it to my dog!  It was a bad experience and merely do not understand because we were nice customers.  We've NEVER had this experience and will not return."}
{"text":"Carolina Classic Burger, oh so good after a late night of partying! Go during the week, late at night b/c it packs out really quick on the weekends after the clubs close. The food is great, menu is like upscale waffle house with a 1950's diner theme. Very clean restaurant, the clientele is varied, and the waitstaff are very good. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped at this diner after leaving the Carowind amusement park.  The diner was packed and the food didn't disappoint.  I had the coconut French toast.  This was the best French toast I've ever had.   Everyone else enjoyed their food and the prices were reasonable and the service was good."}
{"text":"I went to the Midnight Diner with my boyfriend this morning for breakfast. We've past it a million times, but have never been before. We were seated immediately and had a friendly and attentive waitress.  We both had chocolate milk (yummy and cold!), I had corn beef hash, scrambled eggs, and a biscuit (all delicious, especially the biscuit), my bf created his own omelette and he really enjoyed that.  The food was good, the menu is huge, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the service was great. I'm happy we finally tried Midnight Diner and I will definitely be back. Next time maybe I'll try the chicken and waffles :)"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago for breakfast and it was great.  I got a simple two egg breakfast.   Came with choice of meat, and I got a biscuit and grits.   Being from out of town, I am always down to try regional foods.  Both the grits and biscuit were amazing!    Fast forward for dinner tonight.  4 in my party ordered firecracker chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich both of which were good.  My brother said the firecracker was not really spicy as you would expect from the name.   Mom got shrimp and grits.  Wonderful!  I got a half fried chicken since my brother couldn't decide what to eat.  I figured might as well get the extra chicken for only $3 more for him.  I ate the white,  he ate the dark.  Sooooo juicy and hot.  Omg, the best.  We were going to go to Prices the other day, but they were closed for Christmas week.   No worries, the chicken here exceeded expectations!  Came with a biscuit and two sides. I ordered the mac and cheese and by recommendation from our server, the collard greens.  Both of which were great.  The collards were a better than the mac and cheese.    And such a fun, happy place!  Everyone was in a great mood."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience! Super clean, awesome music variety, amazing food! The hostess was attentive and the waiter was super accommodating and was very personable! The experience was great as there was a good atmosphere and friendly staff. I've never been in the Charlotte area and happened to stumble upon this gem of a secret in downtown Charlotte! I will definitely be back and bragging about my experience and highly suggesting it to my family and friends as well as my fellow yelpsters!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a \"0\" I would but I will give it 1 star because the food is GREAT. However the Customer Service is TERRIBLE. Especially when you order to go. They never get the order correct....NEVER. I live downtown and would order from here like every two weeks. SOMETHING was always wrong with my order. You speak to the Manager about it and they are so lackadaisical. So only thing I could do is not spend my money there. So I didnt eat there for a Year. Even when my friends wanted to go, I would decline and sometimes we would choose another place or I would just go home.  My wife wanted the grits really bad today so I got POSTMATES to pick up the order for me. Yeah, it was wrong...AGAIN. Missing my bowl of Grits (main reason we ordered) and I ordered 2 midnight specials and only received the eggs and bacon for one of them. So All i got for my meal is the pancakes! what makes is worse is the POSTMATES guy was like \"man.....they are kinda rude and rushy..\" He showed me the receipt and the receipt is CORRECT.  I called spoke to \"Reba\" who said she was the manager on duty. Might as well had spoke to a street sign. Had to repeat myself multiple times and she seemed annoyed.   I will not be going there ANYMORE and I have already secured the contact information for the owner. I will be writing him directly. I am a business owner and i think its important for him to know that though his business seems successful on paper because people come back for the food, they probably could be doing 10xs better if the service was better.

{"text":"Good food, good value, friendly service, in a comfortable casual atmosphere. The real rating - I'll be back.    - Food: Had shrimp & grits and their \"famous\" chocolate cake. Very good food.  - Ambience: Classic shiny diner. Great mix of music from hip hop to classic rock, fitting a very mixed clientele.  - Service: Good service, enough attention without being annoying.  - Location: Convenient - just south of downtown."}
{"text":"Tried Midnight diner tonight for the first time. Meh describes it perfectly. Had Gails famous chicken salad sandwich hubby had club sand. both bland had to keep adding pepper to the chicken salad to get some kind of taste. Saturday night at 7:00 and they were out of banana pudding? Who does that? This was supposed to be one of their famous desserts! Don't you think if you saw you were running low Saturday morning you could whip some up since it is supposed to be made \"in house\"? We have tried Madies and like it better it also got a better write up in the paper from food critic, it is just a little hard to find but food was better and better value for the money. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Ok... This is Charlotte's biggest secret!!  Shhhhhh.... don't tell anyone..but their Shrimp & Grits, Chicken & Waffles, Fried chicken Mac & cheese collard greens dinner is the \"BOMB\"....     I truly can't believe,  that I've been in Charlotte for 4 1/2 years...and no one gave me the 411 on this place..    Well, I guess that's why it's Charlotte's secret..lol!!     Seriously... it's one of the cleanest, nicest place in Charlotte to enjoy a delicious meal, without breaking the bank.                                                                                         Great diner atmosphere, coupled with old skool music... What more can you ask for....  Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat at. Reasonable prices, upbeat & friendly staff, short wait times (in my opinion)...and most of all great food. We had Chicken & Waffles, Chicken & French Toady and a Burger. All were solid and satisfying meals. The chicken was moist but wasn't greasy. And the French toast were nice thick crispy slices. The waffle was ok, nothing to rave about but nothing to diminish either. And The burger was about a 4 out of 5. The atmosphere is always popping and fast pace which I love. This diner is a staple on the Southend Charlotte scene that one MUST eat at."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food  This place is good when you are not dieting lol  Could be a bit faster service and cleaner"}
{"text":"OMG! You must try the shrimp and grits. I crave them all time. Mmmmmm.  Cute diner, service was kind and nice"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, basic breakfasts and meals, some taken up a notch.  OH, and a beer menu! Hubs was thrilled with The Bubba and it looked amazing. Eggs on biscuits with sausage gravy.   I was happy to get the Midnight special with turkey bacon.  Basic egg breakfast made your way, but the pancakes were heavy/dry, although good flavor.  Obviously a favorite in walking distance of the Uptown!  Good thing we got there early, or we would have stood in line."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the bad reviews. I've been here 3 times since it opened in September, and I've been very pleased with the food and the service. After all, it's a diner, and if a diner can fix a grilled cheese sandwich the way it's supposed to be made, then it gets good marks in my book. The fried chicken is ridiculously good, and I have a hunch they might be getting the fried chicken from Price's Chicken Coop! Okay, maybe not, but it's just as good.  I'm sure this place will get better with time. I like it, so that should count for something, no?"}
{"text":"Loved this place , dinner was good :)  food is too much to eat though :) I liked the ambience , it's cozy n bright :) I feel bad for eating after my gym though :("}
{"text":"I seem to be odd man out here. I've been here several times and never had any real delay getting sitted or attended to by a waitress. Admittedly, I tend to focus on sandwiches and burgers. My wife and I have enjoyed every visit and are a quickly becoming regulars. Service is always friendly without being pushy or constantly. The manager has checked on us every visit so far as well.  Personally, I would happily recommend it for some one looking for a good, reasonably priced meal.  The music and memorablia on the are nice touches as well.  You also must try the hand-mixed shakes, as they are excellent and remind me of what you get at the little mom & pop restaurants."}
{"text":"The food here was good! We were lucky to have gotten here before they got busy on a Saturday night around 630pm. The portions were HUGE and the service was good. All the food we ate was extremely hot and fresh, you could tell they just made it before bringing it to our table. I would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for comfort food  also, the music they played here was on point! Haha my family and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Service was awesome and food is delicious. You have to try the chocolate cake. It is the moistest cake I have ever had. Well worth the price by far.. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This was my first time going here and I was highly impressed. I arrived at the midnight diner with two of my coworkers for a evening meal and boy was it Great!!..the atmosphere inside was a 50s vibe. The music was modern and throwback which was perfect and our sever was very young attentive and social.  I purchase the midnight special with 2 scrambled eggs with cheese, two sausage patties, grits with cheese and two pancakes. Boy was that food cooked just right and affordable..will come again. THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"This is a neat diner but I was underwhelmed with the food.  I ordered the chicken tenders which were good.  My friend had avocado burger which he said was bland.  Cute concept but would not return."}
{"text":"Food is OK but the music is obnoxiously loud.  I left there 2 hours ago and my ears are still ringing.  I put in my earbuds to tone down the music but it only cut it by 10%.  You have to yell to be heard over the music just to order your food.    I wouldn't eat there again if the food was free and they gave me a $50 bill when I departed. Totally disgusted."}
{"text":"This place was ok when we came in the hostess was kind of rude. We didn't get a waitress until we asked for one. When we eventually got a waitress he was cool kinda sarcastic. The food was great the hash brown just needs more salt GRITS ARE PERFECT would come again."}
{"text":"The food is great. Customer service is great. Only downside to this place is it gets too packed and loud. On a busy night you can barely hear the person sitting next to you."}
{"text":"Something about this place that just kind of sneaks up on you unexpectedly when you first come upon it. I've always been sort of a night owl roaming around Uptown in search of social events to keep myself entertained and I spot this retro looking dinner that apparently is 24/7 which is terrific because I can't think of a better area in town that could benefit from a restaurant like that (There was an older one back in the day near the CPCC central campus but it had to close due to that school's vast expansion) The appeal of the place was too enticing and I was due for a meal anyhow so I popped in to give them a try. It's not a huge place but sizeable enough to handle the type of steady traffic they would generate. The nostalgic feel is replicated on the inside as good as it's exterior. The menu offers a nice variety of what you what expect from an all hours place with enough breakfast & dinner choices to suit all tastes. They on the menu some different shakes & deserts that looking promising although I haven't gotten around to trying them yet. They also have some beer\wine choices and they are willing to make you a mixed drink but they don't really advertise any particular kinds so it could be sort of hit or miss depending on what they have on hand. The food quality in very solid, won't blow you away but never anything that would keep you from coming back for more.  All in all, a nice diversion from the chain restaurants in the world  that is well worth a visit if you need a good meal in the uptown\south end area!"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Food was fresh and hot and delicious. Will be back tomorrow.  Grits and Shrimp... Yummy!  Chicken strips ... Fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Walked down to the Midnight Diner on a frigid night in Charlotte... was warmly greeted and seated instantly... service was friendly. Food was good diner fare and the milkshake was above average!  Highly recommended for 24x7 food, and its only just outside the main downtown area!"}
{"text":"Above-par for diner food. I'd skip the grilled cheese but the chicken soup is great.  This place never disappoints for late-late-night dining, people watching and tunes."}
{"text":"Omg the BEST  shrimp and grits I ever ate...yes there was a line buy with food that good there should be a line"}
{"text":"Such an awesome find last night! I got the Bubba and my gf got the chicken and waffles. Everything tastes great and the staff was super nice. Also it was a very clean diner I recommend this place to anyone who loves comfort food!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to stop by Midnight Diner and I must say I was impressed! The food was great and the service was excellent! Tammie\Tammy was an amazing server!"}
{"text":"I came in about 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was packed. I got the famous shrimp and grits and they were phenomenal. Our server Cori, was excellent and very entertaining. I love the classic diner look and feel. Overall my experience was outstanding. Good food, good prices, and great hours all through the night."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a shot of Jack Daniels with your breakfast?  A truly 1 of a kind atmosphere.  Why settle for IHOP when you can come here?"}
{"text":"Good ole' Midnight Diner.. a classic stop for a Sunday hangover.   This little diner is quiet small on the inside so wait times can be lengthy (20-45+ minutes) on peak times (Sunday Brunch particularly).   There is a large variety of options on the menu to satisfy any mood you are in. Breakfast is served all day and all night (thank you lord). They also have your typical diner food (burgers, fries, shakes etc). I stick with my normal brunch plate: eggs, grits, and potatoes. It never disappoints.   Rating 4 stars only because it can sometimes be dirty with the high volume of traffic in such a small place. The wait time is also tough on a hangover (out of their control but still a struggle)."}
{"text":"I live right across the street and I don't know why I don't eat here more often! I have been here about 4 times now and there is always a line out the door later on in the night on the weekends and on Sunday morning. I ordered take out on Thursday night and it was ready in about 15 minutes. I got the Firecracker Shrimp salad and I'm kind OBSESSED now. First off, that bread! Whoa, topped with shredded cheese then under neath all the ooze is garlic/honey flavor. You will want to eat both pieces right away.The portion was generous and full of veggies. The creamy Parmesan dressing goes perfectly with the spicy breaded shrimp.  I also took a few, ok numerous bites of the bacon ranch wrap and mini burger sliders. Both were great, but the sliders....oh I could have ate both of them! Grilled onions, cheese and pickles. That's all you need. Ohh, and that secret sauce! Delicious! The buns are baked in house and they had a sweetness about them. I loved their seasoned fries. I need to try the shrimp and grits next!   I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The only negative thing I can say about this place is the long wait. The two times I've been there, the line was out the door. Once I was seated and started eating, I understood why. The food is outstanding. I've had the chicken wings and waffles. Delicious. The chicken was crispy, fried hard and well seasoned. The waffle was perfection. But to me, the absolute best item on the menu was the grits. They were the most creamy grits I've ever eaten. I got them to put cheddar in my grits. They were delicious. Next time I'm there, I will definitely get grits again. The menu has a very large selection of food. I really enjoyed dining there."}
{"text":"Fried chicken n biscuits with a side of sausage gravy and shrimp grits ... to die for! Best I've ever had!  Great service!  Must stop if your driving through Charlotte ... Just off Route 77!"}
{"text":"Charles H. is a liar. There is no way his review is genuine. We had lunch there today and our experience was not even close to Charles' fantasy. However, I am not here to review Charles.   Diner itself is cool. No police cars there today. Diner's are, as one reviewer put it, supposed to be places serving fast,greasy,cheap food in large quantities. Showmar's has larger quantities and the food is probably at least as good.     The service was fine. I had the Philly Cheeseteak but didn't order the a la carte fries. The sandwich was cooked well and tasty but I could have eaten three of them. My companion ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it looked small and he said it was only OK. He did order the a la carte fries though and they were very mediocre, at best.   I asked the server if I could order breakfast at lunch and she said no sir but they are thinking about changing that. Also said the a la carte sides are something management is looking at as well.   This place could be very cool but right now it has the feel of a corporate chain \"diner\". Diner's, Drive In's and Dives will not be stopping here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The go-to spot for late night dining! They have everything you need. (Including a little bar lol) They have everything you would expect to find in a diner, but better! The fried chicken...gives the Chicken Coop a run for their money. Anyone from Charlotte (and transports) knows what that means. Well worth the 18 minute wait. I'm still trying to figure out what's in those darn grits!!!!!! They are so creamy. The food is simple and delicious. If there's any kind of event going on in Charlotte *cough cough...CIAA*, expect a long wait to get in the door! You won't be disappointed. SN: They also have a little food cart behind the Uptown Cabaret!"}
{"text":"Went in to warm up and wait for crowds to clear after the ACC championship game. Diner has a unique personality, as does the wait staff. Sorry to say the food was not good: chicken soup was warm, not hot; grilled ham n cheese was cold enough that the cheese did not melt; sausage was overcooked and shriveled up; waffles were cold. On the other hand, chicken strips were good and the grits were tasty and hot. Overall, an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this diner. The waitstaff is friendly and the food is delicious! Try the grits!"}
{"text":"I would have given the overall rating of 2 (because the staff was unprofessional and unpleasant), except I was there during CIAA weekend and I gave them a little credit since the restaurant was so packed.  Pros: -On a cold, busy night, we were sat within 15 min. -It was clean. Even with all the people there, they turned over tables quickly and everything looked good, even the restroom. -2 of us split a chicken and waffle meal and they gave us no trouble adding a wing. (Nor did they charge us a \"share\" fee). The chicken and waffle meal was EXCELLENT. -The sweet tea was excellent, but that's to be expected in the South. -The total bill for 5 people (4 meals) was only $40.  Cons: -The \"host\" (a big man at the front door yelling to guests) was not friendly. Very aggressive and not attentive. I know it was busy but still, he could have been nicer. -The waitress(es) (because we were served by about 3 of them) were ok. They were not overly friendly or accommodating. They were average. One of the ones that served us told us that she wasn't our server when we asked for more napkins. :-/   Overall, I'd go back to enjoy the food on a less busy night if I'm in town again. However, I'd hope that the service was better."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not a bad wait for Sunday afternoon. Had chicken and waffles. Had to wait for syrup. Server AJ was friendly."}
{"text":"Reading other reviews, both good and critical, there are some valid observations. Nothing about this place feels upscale, the crowd is a mix, it's always busy, the Shrimp & Grits is incredible. While Texas Pete is available and punches up the flavor, the creole sauce is robust enough to stand alone, the green peppers maintain a crunch of freshness, and the grits are smooth. Don't know if they can blacken the shrimp, but that would be a nice finish to this otherwise excellent plate the menu says is made to order. Five stars is based on this experience"}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative star I would! I'm usually a regular at midnight diner because I work weekends at a night club not too far from there. However, I just went to place a to go order and was never acknowledged and finally after sitting there for 20 minutes me and my coworkers were informed by a waitress that they were not allowed to place a order. WHAT!? Never again!"}
{"text":"First time here while visiting Charlotte. Nice environment. Food was delicious will definitely visit again when I'm in Charlotte.  My boys loved there food."}
{"text":"What you would expect in a Diner..... A good simple and hearty breakfast.  They have all the standard breakfast fare, be it omelets (egg white variety too), pancakes, french toast or belgian waffles.  They have amazingly tasty and buttery biscuits so forego the toast for the biscuit, and order a side of sausage gravy to split with your table.  Also the grits are amazing, and I'm not a huge grits fan, but these suckers have butter or cream in them that make them delectable.  I suggest having one person get grits and others in your party get the hash browns and you go halfsy and share.  The Friendly staff seem like they have been there for years, and they are efficient at least while sitting at the counter where I was.  Believe me you will leave this place exceptionally full that will last you all day.  I'm still full while writing this review, and I was there about 6 hours ago :)"}
{"text":"Everything we had was SOOO good. Coconut French toast and wings is a must try. Service was great too. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time coming here was during ciaa and the waitress stopped the music to say \"if you got your food and ate already, get the hell out of my diner! \" Never have I ever experience such poor customer service. How  can an establishment treat their PAYING customers like this?? Solely based on that poor customer service, I would not recommend this diner to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend, a charlotte resident recommended this place and im glad we did! Best grits i ever had! The fried chicken was excellent, perfectly done....juicy and crispy! Based on reviews i swapped the waffle for french toast which not surprising was delicious!  The waitress was a sweetheart. We definitely plan on going nack tomorrow to try out more....the menu had so much to choose from everything sounded so good!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at midnight diner. Staff is really nice and attentious from the hostess to the server. Our server gave us suggestions before we ordered and was always present giving us refills and asking if everything was all right. She even cared about the fact that I'm pregnant and made sure that my food was well done and the broccoli cooked with no salt. Great service. The food didn't take too long to be prepared and everything tasted really good.  I got the hamburger steak with broccoli and mac n cheese and my husband got grilled cheese and breaded chicken tenders. It was all really delicious. For drinks we just got ginger ale that was always refilled, and that's how it should be. Overall we had a great experience and will for sure be visiting again."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. Pleasant staff. What more can you ask for. Oh, and late night hours WoW."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences and good experiences here but what else could be expected of a place that has such high volume. This restaurant is very popular for a good reason. It has an awesome location and is open 24 hours plus has an extensive menu and booze! I'll definitely return and play \"waitress roulette\" because some of the servers are less than..."}
{"text":"Been here about 6 times for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's really uneven in terms of both food and service. Our first time, for a late lunch, food and service were both solid. After that, not so much.  Prices are good. Breakfasts are large. The sliders come with mayonnaise on them which I despise, so that kinda ruined one of the lunches. Had a spaghetti with meat sauce as a special last week that was truly bland and soggy -- and the most expensive item on the special menu. Also had the smallest Texas toast I'd ever seen.   Was there a few days ago on a sort of busy day and the staff were absolutely in the weeds. Couldn't even point people to empty, clean tables. We waited ages, with our small child getting increasingly unruly, before my husband just finally took a seat. They seemed annoyed by that and took forever to bring set-ups, water etc. I'd hate to see them when they were really full. As we left there was a line out the door and quite a few empty tables; the staff just never found their rhythm.  The place is clean and there is a good jukebox. At times the music can be too loud, but it's fun. I like this place and will probably return for staples like breakfast or a burger, but will stay away from their specials. I'll keep looking for the diner experience I know that's done better in other parts of the country."}
{"text":"Their shrimp and grits are fuckin amazing like everyone else stated. Their chicken and waffles are delicious. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"There are few places near uptown that are as accessible and as easy to get to as Midnight Diner.  I ordered the coffee and it was generally what I expected from a diner lol.  I didn't come here for the award winning coffee.  It's a good place to stop by to grab a quick breakfast that is decently prepared.  The morning crowd is drastically different than the late night crowd; it is comprised mostly of professionals on their way to work.  The service is much better early in the morning.  You'll see what I mean if you visit this place during the night hours.  Overall I love occasionally stopping by this place.  Try the Fried Chicken for lunch.  It's good."}
{"text":"Great service, food is fresh.  Everybody is super down to earth and friendly.  Busy place, expect a 15+ min.wait, but worth it.  If you want to enjoy a casual dining experience with good food, come here.  We will frequent here. Thank you..."}
{"text":"I usually get the fried chicken here, which is delicious.  It comes with a biscuit that's sadly usually old or overcooked that I end up not eating, but I don't really care 'cuz it's free.  They have French toast which is made of that huge challah bread and tastes like you're eating bread that's been dipped in the eggs from god's ovaries, ohhh it's that yummy.  (God has ovaries right?  He's like, both, right, has everything?)  Their chicken noodle soup is sadly a disappointment.  I'm always on the search for delicious chicken noodle soup, and theirs was all... bleh.  The broth was icky and the noodles were thin and twirly.  Restaurant chicken noodle should be thick strips of noodles, you foolish fools, not twirly little pathetic bastards!!  But that's not why they get four stars instead of five.  The reason is their music.  Usually I come there late at night and, I dunno, I guess they're going for this trendy club-atmosphere or something, because they BLAST that shit and it's awful.  It's not that I hate the music (which I do because it's awful trendy crap, but I could change it by picking something out of the jukebox if I wanted), it's that it's SO.  Friggin'.  Loud.  I guess, I dunno, the rest of you people have so completely damaged your hearing that you don't notice, but to me it's physically painful.  It's like sound warfare and I feel like I'm being attacked.  Plus I can't actually talk to my companion(s) without shouting at them.  Since atmosphere is a big deal when going out to eat, there have been a few times where we've decided NOT to go there because we aren't in the mood to put up with such loud nose.  But you know, they change that and bam.  I'll give 'em five stars.  And since we all know how much everyone wants MY five stars, I bet they'll be doing it within minutes.  Huhuhuhuhuh.  Update:  They don't do cheese fries anymore.  For some reason.  Considering cheese fries is just melting cheese on fries, both of which they have, in like a microwave or under a heat lamp, this loses them a star.  It was my favorite side.  :C"}
{"text":"I haven't left a restaurant due to the service in a very long time so, it's upsetting that I had to leave this dinner because of it. I have eaten here on numerous occasions, both late night and for brunch. Though it seems the service has been put last on the list.  45+ minutes for two eggs and grits on a sunday at 2pm is inconceivable with over 10 people on wait staff, and I ended up taking my order to go which had not a single thing I ordered correct, and no utensils or napkins. I understand that this place get busy, its right off the light rail and good prices for a greasy spoon but dang, never have I waited that long"}
{"text":"The midnight dinner misses the mark, the first time we went we thought it was great and than we went back and everything was very wrong. The restaurant is filthy, their sanitation score is a 90 and I should have know better. The cleanliness is a HUGE issue! Their floors are constantly slippery due to grease, the silverware and cups are always dirty food particles on them, it's just disgusting."}
{"text":"Got into Charlotte on a late flight and needed something to eat...with limited options at 12:30am gave it a shot. Ordered a Bubba special...wow that's a lot of food!!... Sausage gravy was amazing...Biscuits great and eggs done just right...sausage was the only let down...dry and no flavor but we'll definitely be back to try other options!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to give this place a great review.  We had to wait awhile to get a table so my curiosity was building.  A very mixed crowd of college students,  senior citizens and families.  Our server was right on us as we sat down. We ordered several breakfast items and we were not disappointed.  All came quickly, correctly and hot. We love this place when traveling for business.  Great local place"}
{"text":"I drove up to Charlotte yesterday to take my girls to Paw Patrol on Sunday and looked up some places to eat after the show. My girls are a little picky so I needed a place that has a bit of everything and Midnight Diner was a great fit! The inside and outside was very cool. Our waitress was really nice and the food came out quick! I will definitely like to come back for another meal."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit. I've notice that many things changed. Ordered (as used to) the Bubba, used to had two biscuits with gravy, bacon, and hash browns. Yesterday I received only 1 biscuit (cut in two halves), the bacon was extremely salty and hash browns raw, not well done at all.  I don't think I'm coming back, I live in Ballantyne and I have best options around here now. The stars are only for Dave."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place rules. My husband ordered the coconut crusted french toast and it was literally the best french toast I've ever had in my life. Biscuits and gravy were great, corned beef hash was excellent and I typically don't like it much. Our server Angela was really nice and prompt, will definitely be coming back here and bringing out of town guests also"}
{"text":"Had fun in Charlotte....great city...horrible restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was great as far as the customer service not so good service was pretty quick but received the wrong food twice . With better customer service this place would easily get 5 stars."}
{"text":"We had another fantastic experience at Midnight Diner; this time for lunch instead of breakfast.  First, being close to Uptown, let me say that I'm SO glad they have very close parking for customers.    Our server, Rachael, was fantastic.  She's what every server should aspire to.  She was friendly, perky, attentive, and genuine.  I hope she never loses that optimism.    One of the lunch specials was Shrimp and Grits with a creamy Cajun sauce.  Rachael recommended it, but my partner was already contemplating it.  That sealed the deal.  He ordered that and I went with the Black & Blue Burger.  I tasted the Shrimp and Grits.  It was SO delicious and full of flavor.  The creamy Cajun sauce was a great addition.  I should have ordered it.  The Black and Blue Burger was just okay.  Maybe it needed more seasoning and blue cheese dressing in addition to the chunks of blue cheese.  Of course, being a bit redder/pinker inside would have been nice, too.  Unfortunately, you can't get that in NC (Boo!).  The fries accompanying it (with a side of ranch that I requested) were delicious, though.    And you can't beat the prices or clean, shiny atmosphere at Midnight Diner.  They're two for two in my book!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weekends ago looking to get a late night dinner. Never again will I go here on a Saturday night. The wait is ridiculous. About 20 minutes later, I sat down at the bar area. The waitress was ok at best. It seemed like the place could have had more waiters on hand. Anyways, the wait wasn't too long for the food. I got 2 biscuit sandwiches which were good. Come here if you're done partying in Uptown for the night and looking for a decent midnight meal."}
{"text":"Ms. Vicki was hilarious and $7.99 for a 2 piece fried chicken and 2 sides, damn !  Went Midnight right before the crowd converged. A mixture of Charlotte I'm guessing as I was visiting. good food incredible prices. The huge slices of cake where really good. Our guest had the chocolate and red velvet and the tasted very fresh"}
{"text":"Alright...this place has taken an early beating, but I still needed to try it for myself. And while they are still working out obvious kinks, my experience was A-OK. I went here for lunch by myself and sat at the countertop area in front for the TV. Nice that Sportscenter was on for me. The menu is extensive and detailed. About 7-8 pages I think, but don't be intimidated by the thinkness. It's just the words that are big, probabloy for those visiting late night that can't see so clearly.   Ordered the \"midnight special\" which is your typical breakfast place 2 of each. 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon/sausage and hashbrowns. All this for $8.99 (see biz pic as I took one). Maybe an extra $1 too much or so, but for the size of the pancakes I can see how they justify it. Only issues was that my over-easy eggs were a little too runny in terms of the egg white. Probably go over-medium to be safe.   A lot of people running around and I did see some food come back ans I was sitting in front of the expediting area. That said; my meal was good and I'd probably go back again."}
{"text":"I generally love diner food, but it's not here. I visit this location at least 4 times a year hoping it would change -- each visit lowers the expectations a little more. I ordered a simple 2 eggs, sausage and rye toast and it took in excess of 25 minutes. Why?  The eggs were wrong, then the toast, and finally it was cold. The wait staff remains disorganised. The service window is too small. The place could use a makeover  to decrease staff congestion.  I will try again in the new year."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere. The shrimp and grits are amazing. Creamiest grits you can imagine. Check it out.   Two cautions: 1. Saturday and Sunday mornings are busy. 2. Limited parking."}
{"text":"This place is always over crowded it seems like and the food that I had I wasn't pleased with and it's always something happening here as far as crime. This place is always on the news it seems like and it's never for the food I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody I have people that swear by it and I have some people that feels the same way I do... I say try at your own risk rather it be the food or your life lol"}
{"text":"Thank you Midnight Diner for not disappointing. This place has the best atmosphere and service and the food is amazing. I'm so glad we made it here while in Charlotte and I believe this place will become a regular stop on our go to places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service. Thats typical. If you can get pass not being greeted, multple different servers, no silverware, u should be ok."}
{"text":"Best Diner in Charlotte !!! Breakfast was outstanding. Generous portions prepared exactly as requested. Friendly service and fair prices. And I hate grits, but the waitress brought some over for me to try. All I can say is \"Delicious!\"."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch. I have driven by this place waiting for it to open sooo many times!! Well it's finally here and I'm glad because it was pretty good for its second to third day open! Parking is annoying...not many spots.  The server was really overwhelmed when we first got there but turned it around midway through. It took a few minutes to be approached and then a little more time for our order to be placed but I figure it couldve been worse!!   It's rainy and gloomy in Charlotte today so I opted for the \"Famous\" Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy....Famous? What makes it famous? (like in ELF when he finds the \"Worlds Best Coffee\"...I love that movie, anyways)The flavor was lacking and seasoning was needed, but the fry on it was good and the chicken was moist. The mashed potatoes were also bland along with the gravy.   All in all not that great of an experience BUT it has all the potential to be great once they figure things out! The servers are still learning the menu as the chefs are too! I will be back only to be proven right that they just need a few days to get into their groove!!"}
{"text":"I went to Midnight Diner at 2:30 am. I was in town for a conference downtown. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was okay, I didn't really care for the sauce included. The customer service was actually great and we didn't have to wait. Midnight Diner has limited parking on the backside.  This is the classic late night/early morning spot after a night downtown."}
{"text":"Not bad for the first time around. Dave started off pretty sluggish and inattentive but he pulled it together and redeemed himself. I ordered the chicken and waffles while my colleague ordered the burger. When her burger arrived with onions, she asked me to switch plates. Even though my taste buds were set for a sweet and salty combo, I was just as pleased with the burger and home cut fries. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a diner that was open late hours and serving real diner food.  Unfortunately, there were too many things about this place that I didn't enjoy that I most likely won't go back unless I'm with a group and I lose the vote.    Upon entering during a busy weekday morning, we were seated pretty quickly, but the hostess and people behind the counter did not appear friendly.  Our server was nice, and the orders came out after a wait, but the food was not great, and expensive for diner food.  I am used to breakfast bills coming in under $20, but not here.  Music was playing loudly at 8 AM and it was hard to have a conversation with someone.  I really wanted to like this place, but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I had a great experience and delightful tasting food today. The service was awesome (shout out to my waitress Ericka Harrison) as I was constantly checked on and my food came out shortly after coming off the burners. If you're in the neighborhood then stop by and check out this place. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Good fried food, beer, and liquor, plus stripers next door, if I could bring my dog along this would be a mans paradise.  I've honestly only run in to stuff my face and then be on with my day here.  Chicken biscuit with a water, in and out in less than 15 mins.  Will give it a proper review in the future, because I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars. There must be some tough critics out there. Either that or people that don't know good food. I learned about this gem from a faculty member in my doctoral program. She told me she heard good things about this place and wanted to check it out. After talking to her, I naturally went on Yelp and looked at the reviews and pictures. Needless to say, my interest was peaked and I went that same night. There was no wait when I arrived and the hostess showed some southern hospitality. I'm not used to that up in Pa. I ordered the dark meat fried chicken dinner with two sides and an extra thigh (call me greedy). My sides were mac n cheese and collard greens. It also came with a biscuit. The food was so good, I had to eat it slow just so it wouldn't go away as fast. No...the food was so good I tried to come back for breakfast two days later. But I was in a rush and there was a 20 minute wait, so I was unable to indulge. Yes I was very heartbroken. Instead of pancakes, I had a Greek sandwich somewhere else. But if I'm ever in Charlotte again....guess where I'm going."}
{"text":"5 stars if you're drunk, two stars if you're sober.  Only come here late at night (midnight's in the name for goodness sake)"}
{"text":"Keiosha was great. Chicken & waffles for $9.99. Group of us were 6 deep and were seated at 2:30 am and waited in a long line that went quickly. Roughly 30mins. And food came in 20mins...perfect for an after party/club'n crowd."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Midnight Diner???  Let's see....when you go here you should definitely expect an \"experience\". Whether it's the waiters and waitresses singing and dancing or the unique dining crowd which really just can't be explained...This place almost always makes one of those nights you and your friends will never forget.  But this review isn't based on any of that...these four stars are solely based on one dish...the shrimp and grits.   My goodness.   One bite of these grits will have you asking yourself: \"Where in the hell did that come from??\" These grits are creamy, dreamy and steamy (if I could think of another rhyming word I would use it) Top that awesomeness with shrimp and I just really don't know what else to say. Geesh...I loved them!   Seriously, if you can manage to find a parking spot and actually get a booth this place is totally worth it."}
{"text":"I refuse to eat at a places where the staff is rude. The very first person I encountered when I walked in the door had an attitude problem (the hostess). So we turned around and walked out the door. I don't care if the foods good. There's tons of great places to eat in Charlotte with friendly staff."}
{"text":"the coconut french toast is to die for!!! good service. friendly atmosphere.  would go back!"}
{"text":"After giving it more shots than it deserved, I'm never going back.  Food: unpredictable, but overall bad Atmosphere: cute decor, poison air Service: spotty, either decent or never again  I wanted to like this place so much. I drove past it every day as it was being built and was intrigued by the large, shiny box. Once it opened, I was extremely excited to give it a try. I mean, it was built to be a diner. It had to be good. Alas, I went a dozen+ times thinking that I had had bad experiences because it just needed time to settle. After all, it's new, it probably has to work out the kinks. I've finally decided that's not true.   We had one waitress who was amazing. A mature lady with witty humor, people skills, and a peppy attitude.The best kind of server you never find. However, most of the servers are below average and a select few are the worst I've had. Ever. Now, what can save a place with terrible service? Amazing eats. No such thing here. The breakfast choices are okay. Lunch is okay. Dinner is okay. The food is not horrible but it certainly isn't great. Nothing tastes fresh. It all just tastes okay.   And okay food does not make up for service this terrible. If you sit within hearing distance of the kitchen or bar, you'll hear servers yelling or making nasty remarks and their hatred for each other fills the air with tension.    Overall, I'm not willing to endure a hostile environment, terrible service, and sub-par food for cheap prices and a convenient location. I'll go to Mattie's Diner for great food, great service, and a pleasant environment and sacrifice my driving minutes instead."}
{"text":"From all those Shrimp & Grits pictures I saw , this place was on my list and I had to go here for those . We were here on an early Sunday Morning and were seated immediately . Our waitress was a Superstar . She was a ball of energy . We got the Omelette ,Pancakes and Grits . Boy o Boy were those grits Creamy ! They were so creamy that I never go to chew on them except for the shrimp. Gulp Gulp Gulp. I would have loved if the dish had more spice but I am not complaining . Omelette was great too . My only gripe was about the pancakes , they were flat ,rubbery and chewy . Not a Fan . Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal and service thoroughly and would go back ."}
{"text":"Avoid at shift change.   Apparently that's when they deceleration.  Oh, and a 95 cleanliness rating."}
{"text":"I was highly recommended to go to this place by a few co-workers and since I am new to the area, I decided to give this a try because I love breakfast. However, once my food came out....Let's just say, I don't get the hype. Maybe it was an \"off day\" but my pancakes were teerrrible... I mean, how can I put this. You really can't screw up eggs, hash browns and bacon - this is almost IMPOSSIBLE to screw up. The pancakes? This is the only reason why I came. The pancakes were: FLAT, TASTELESS, PLAIN and Tasted like boxed pancake mix, mixed with water. These were some really bad pancakes. There was zero flavor and looked undercooked. FLAT. Oh, I said that already. The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 stars? Well, my husband liked his French toast. I'm going to give it another try because my coworkers SWEAR this place is great but I will steer clear from the Midnight Diner Special. No pancakes for me.   The service? This was another blah - I don't ask for much. But he was not attentive at all."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated! Although the staff is friendly and the food is ok+decently priced, even their to-go orders take forever= I've never waited less than 30mins for anything- including salads! Inside feels grimy, music is cranked up way too loud, the late-night crowd is a mixture of hood and trash clientele, male customers verbally harass you if you're not interested in flirting back with them, panhandlers bombard you in the parking lots... not surprised that shootings have happened on this property. I highly recommend going to the other 24hr places in the area."}
{"text":"The French toast and shrimp and grits are a must! The food is always consistently great!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food is delicious. The staff  are super nice.  If you ever on Charlotte and Love GOOD COMFORT food, you MUST eat here"}
{"text":"Definitely do not go here sober or during the day hours. The food simply isn't that good at all. The coveted fried chicken is alright but there are many other options in the area. It is a good late night option after a lot of drinking. The crowd can get extremely rough. The food is average but you will have some good people watching opportunities. Don't expect much from food and service and you'll be alright."}
{"text":"Midnight Diner is home of the best French Toast I have ever had. The grits are also amazing.  Don't go to Midnight Diner expecting a nice brunch place. It is definitely a casual diner, but the service is great and the food is pretty amazing! Plus it is always open!"}
{"text":"Gotta love 'The Diner'. It gets busy here. Like, crazy busy. Service has always been good, but sometimes you need to just know ahead of time you'll have to wait to get seated.   If you're trying to call in an order --- you'll really have to get lucky and be dedicated. There are times where it won't go through, times where it'll ring and ring and nobody answers, and other times where you'll be put on hold only to get hung up on 3 minutes later. This is the one area that Midnight Diner realllllly needs to improve upon.  Breakfast --  Chicken & Waffles are good. Not the best you'll ever have, but definitely worth an order if you're craving chicken for bfast. My absolute go-to breakfast order is their shrimp 'n grits. The sauce is juuuuust spicy enough to have a kick, but still easily enjoyable. And the biscuit that comes with it?!?! Double up, buttercup.   Salads -- If you're feeling a salad, you will not regret ordering either the Picnic & the Firecracker Shrimp. Both of these are some of my favorite salads to order from a restaurant. not the healthiest you could go, but hey, you're comprimising and eating lettuce, right? And they come with garlic bread.   Wraps -- The firecracker chicken or cool ranch wrap are crowd pleasers."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast food. The grits are some of the best I've had, and the chicken and waffles are delicious as well. May want to go earlier in the evening however because the line is \"out the door\" anytime after ten."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and poor service. Noticeably went downhill over the last 5 years. Ambiance and location are still great. Free parking is limited."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!! Always packed and busy so get there early! I recommend the chicken and waffles, hash browns, orange juice, and fruit. The diner is very reasonably priced for an uptown Charlotte restaurant."}
{"text":"Ah,....the Midnight Diner.  One of the only places open late all the time so that I can be a super fattie whenever I want.  Let's talk about the decor/environment first.        I've been here at all hours of the day and it's usually a standard mix of people (Obviously the Twenty-something Club crowd is here in the wee hours of the morning) and average \"Diner-ish\" decor.  What I mean by that is, your standard framed posters of music icons and bright red paint and shiny stainless steel.     Now the food,... it's delicious.  Their burgers are large, tasty and served with gigantic steak fries.  Their Breakfast may be the best selection that  they have.  I highly recommend \"The Bubba\" which is a huge plate of biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs and my choice of Hash browns and Bacon.  It's at kind of a steep price ringing in at 8 bucks but like I said, it's a huge plate of food.  Their bacon is great and while that seems as if it's not a great feat, trust me it is.  I'm kind of an aficionado.  Today I had a fried chicken breast with a Belgian waffle.  Their waffle had just the right amount of vanilla extract and it challenged me to order a second one.  On the other hand, the chicken was slightly underwhelming.  The breading was just breading that lacked any great amount of flavor and while the actual meat wasn't dry per se, it wasn't exceptionally juicy.  I felt that it was just as good as any fried chicken I've made at home and I'm not a fabulous cook by any means.       The Midnight Diner gets my vote for late night feasting and you can't go wrong with the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Horrid. Grotesque and if there were a worse adjective I would use that. I can't fathom how this place has any good ratings. Perhaps drunken millennial smasholes? It took us 20 minutes to be greeted at least. My well done burger was cold. Not quite sure how that happens and my husband is currently sticking his finger down his throat in the bathroom bc he felt so ill after his oh so delectable meal. Spare Yourselves, your digestive tracts and go elsewhere...you're better than this."}
{"text":"Best grits on the WORLD! really!!! Clean, fun, bright, 50's music. On the light rail at Carson blvd stop. Also has tvs showing sports."}
{"text":"I had a long blonde Hair in my drink (on the lemon) & what appeared to be the leg of a roach in my sisters grits.  I've always loved the food so if you're going to overlook sanatation issues then I'd get the shrimp & grits. Chicken & waffles is a good second. If you don't want breakfast I'd go with the cheeseburger sliders.  Good luck."}
{"text":"It took a while to get seated but hey it's tournament weekend.  My friend and I ordered entirely too much food and it was all good. Rae was our server and she was PHENOMENAL and very entertaining, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful,  and pleasant.  I'll be back to sit in her section."}
{"text":"Stopped into Charlotte totally on a whim with an incredible appetite. Midnight Diner definitely delivered! Small joint with private parking. The menu had great options for whatever your mood. Service was friendly & pretty quic. The shrimp & grits was amazing...very flavorful. We also ordered the chicken & waffles. The chicken was crispy and the waffle tasted like cake!   I sure hope to get bake to this place"}
{"text":"The food is good however, I prefer to butter my toast instead of the cheap oleomargarine. Prices are fair though, and will come again!"}
{"text":"Heard this was a Charlotte staple and I wasn't disappointed! This was my first time trying Midnight Diner and everything from the service to the food was on point! My bf ordered the French toast, eggs, sausage, and grits while I had the western omelet with turkey bacon. Delicioso (Kodak Black reference)! Couldn't be more satisfied. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a basic meal, particularly breakfast food."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles.  Repeat after me: CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.  You must have this.  The fried chicken wings that come with it are the biggest dang wings I've ever seen.  Among the best fried chicken I've had in the South, too.  The large, Belgian waffle was a bit soft rather than crispy, but tasted good (and some people like waffles soft).  Maple syrup comes on the side so you can add as much or as little as you like.  Grits are very buttery so you won't need to add butter to them.  Cooked just right and creamy and yummy.  Satisfied my grits craving nicely.  My companions enjoyed their 3-egg breakfasts with bacon, and my Canadian friend tried grits for the first time.  He likes them.  :)  Very busy on a Sunday for brunch/lunch so expect to wait about a half hour to get seated.  Small amount of waiting in the foyer so if it's hot or rainy that day you should bring an umbrella for some shade while standing outside.  Alcohol available is limited to beer and a handful of distilled spirits.  Price of the meal depends a lot on what you order, as this place has a huge menu that is served 24/7.  But the three of us had breakfast for around $40 total."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service was perfect my 92 year old world war 2 vet grandfather couldn't come in the front and they let him in the back door. Food is cooked perfectly and is delicious."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and decided to come here due to the good reviews. Our wait to get in wasn't too bad considering it was a Sunday morning. We were a group of 5 and it took over 30 minutes to receive our food. Our waiter was constantly talking to tables, flirting and giving out his number. This wouldn't be an issue if other tables that sat down after us didn't get their food before us. Our waiter stated it was because there were 5 of us and due to us ordering grits and sausage as sides our wait would be longer. My food was forgotten and while my family finished eating I still hadn't received my food. This shouldn't be the case because other tables were receiving the same food. Overall the food was okay."}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner in the Charlotte area. Their coffee is awesome, and the bubba is where it's at!!!! Order with a side of grits because they're amaze. Highly recommend. It does get extremely crowded on weekends, though, so keep that in mind especially if you're really hungry lol"}
{"text":"Overall, the food and service were a-ok, but nothing about this visit blew me away.  As other reviewers have mentioned, parking is sparse, especially when you are there at lunchtime on a weekday.    Since I was by myself, I just sat at the counter.  The place was pretty busy and it took awhile before anyone came to take my drink order so I already knew what I wanted to order when my server finally did stop by.   I figured since I was at a diner, I couldn't go wrong with ordering breakfast.  I went with black coffee and the San Bernardino Omelet. The coffee was pretty good and did not taste burnt.  The omelet was made with diced chicken, cheddar cheese, avocado, and pico de gallo.  I went with hash browns as my side and whole wheat toast.    Overall, the omelet was not bad, but I did not care for the pico de gallo - it had too much harsh onion flavor for my taste. I pushed it to the side but unfortunately, it left an aftertaste of onion on part of my omelet.   The hash browns were \"meh\"... a little bland and just a touch on the greasy side. (I probably should have gone for the grits.... I saw in another review that they were creamy and tasty.)  The toast was not really toasted at all, which was not good.   (As a side note, while I was waiting for my order, I had a peek at their biscuits, and based on how yummy they looked, I should have gone with the biscuit instead!)  Another thing I spied while I waited for my dish was a plate of chicken & waffles...which looked pretty good.  If I go back, I may have to give that a try.    The employees were very busy, but nice, and I think if I had gone at a less busy time, I would have gotten more attentive service.  However, the manager did come by to see how I liked my omelet, so I appreciated that.   At $12.95 for a coffee & an omelet plus $3 for tip, the price was a little higher than I had expected when I walked in the door.   But, the menu is quite extensive, so if I happen to be in the neighborhood again, I would stop in to give them another try."}
{"text":"Went to the Midnight Diner for the first time.  It wasn't so bad.    A friend and I went at late night because we wanted something good to eat.  I suggested the Midnight Diner because I always see people going here.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles, but I honestly wasn't impressed.  The waffle was good, but the Chicken was dry.  Maybe it was a first time thing, but I'm willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night around midnight, coincidentally. Server was super nice, veggie burgers weren't bad-not what they're known for obviously. I would go back."}
{"text":"Fresh off of an airplane and hungry for breakfast we headed to the Midnight Diner for sustenance. I had hoped for a biscuit with country ham but alas it was not to be found on the menu. I settled for biscuit with sausage gravy and an egg on top. Not bad.   The menu has a fairly good range of selections .My companion's omelet was good. Nothing extra ordinary nothing bad."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. I recommend the chicken and coconut French toast. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles. Wings Crispy and juicy yet light enough for breakfast. Service was great especially chasmine! She let me sample her coconut French toast which was super good! Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Just take a half-step inside the shiny, chrome doors and see how Midnight Diner came to rest on Carson/Tryon. Uhhh....not so much hammer-and-nail here, but how about a nice trip down the highway on the back of a semi-truck? Sure. Rad. Pretty rad indeed.   Churning out pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, omelets, and burnt coffee like they're going out of style, Midnight Diner is a haven for late-night carbloaders from all corners of Crown Town. If you're showing up for a 5-star meal, you might want check yourself at the door. It's a diner through and through. Low ceiling, cushy booths, counter seating, jukebox, old waiters, waitresses, line cooks. Like a Norman Rockwell. Just great.   You'll most likely walk out smelling like a mixture of vegetable oil and bad coffee, but sometimes pancakes are the only thing that will satiate an all-night rage before you hit the sack.   I'm especially fond of the hashbrowns that come \"smothered, scattered, and chunked.\" Cheese, onions, and ham. Also, biscuits and gravy in this joint are spot on.   Glad that Midnight Diner is around and keeping Charlotte's nightlife well-fed with good ol' \"brinner.\""}
{"text":"This place is a find!  We landed in Charlotte after a very early flight and Yelped it for a breakfast place. It was just what we were looking for. From the start the hostesses greeted us warmly, no waiting!  We ordered a few different biscuits but the best was the chicken biscuit with a little bit of honey... so stinkin yummy!  Also ordered a side of hash browns with ham on top and were not disappointed. They were flavorful and the portion size generous. Nice strong coffee, just right sweet tea with friendly service.  Great tunes playing in the background only added to the authentic diner feel. Gotta try this joint!"}
{"text":"So this was my first visit to the Diner. I initially came in wanting shrimp and grits but was quickly swayed after seeing a Yelp review. Although what I ordered isn't on the menu, the kitchen didn't mind substituting what I wanted. So I ordered the fish dinner and subbed the fries and grits for grits. The fish is white cod, which I was super hesitant about but ended up LOVING! My server suggested I get it fried hard and with seasoning. I also ordered an egg and homemade biscuit. Great meal!! Please try guys"}
{"text":"Love this place mainly because they have the best chicken tenders I've ever had!! It's what I've gotten every single visit since I discovered them. They're so juicy and are served steaming hot each time! I recently discovered that if you get them off the appetizer menu, you get a generous 5 tenders and a small serving of fries for super cheap - perfect portion, perfect price. Not to mention the peach-colored sauce that comes with it (smells/tastes like a mix of mayo and hot sauce) is bomb. If you're looking for a cheap late-night meal with friends and don't mind waiting out the guaranteed line, this is the spot to go!"}
{"text":"Generally, since we only had dessert, I wouldn't review Midnight Diner until I went back for a full meal. The thing is I don't see that happening.  While the decor is completely charming (a clean, bright rendition of the classic diner vibe), the hours are where it's at (all of them), and the cake that I tasted (a bite of chocolate and many bites of carrot) was rich and delicious the overall experience was soured by the service.  Our waiter hovered over our booth (his only table at the post-midnight time) and kept asking if we were ready to order even though he was literally watching us still discuss what to split. Only once we decided on the brownie sundae, which he had suggested, did he tell us they were out of some of the ingredients. Maybe it's because I really hate feeling rushed or doing things twice, but by the time I ate fraction of my huge piece of cake I really had no desire to return. The food may be good, but there are other places to get good diner food in the wee hours in CLT."}
{"text":"Spent 30 mins in line with my pregnant sister which is expected for a pack restaurant. Unfortunately, half the tables were empty. When I asked why no one was being sat down to eat. The employees shrugged their shoulders. I then asked to speak to the manager. She explained it was a busy day and they would sit people when they cleaned the tables. I visibly saw them clean the tables. The managers name was Angie. Would not encourage people to visit here in the future"}
{"text":"Nom.com   Charlotte staple and the latest bite in town. Being in the south can suck after midnight but midnight diner feels the void on quality food, quick service and late night hours. Whether your a banker grabbing take out in your way home or you've been drinking the night away at a near by bar. Skip the chicken and waffles and get the shrimp and grits. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm an African American. I just left this place after waiting more than 5mins just for someone to say hello and seat my party of 4. I waiting while 3 servers walked by me and didn't provide any customer service. After I made a scene because it was a line at the door and several African American patrons waiting with seats available, I rang the bell on my phone and finally the hostess who was standing at the register looking sat us at a table. After less than 3mins sitting down, the owner asked us to leave because two patrons were upset about whatever was said which wasn't said about us about they way they had us waiting at the door. So w proceed to get a reason and eventually left.  I don't care how legendary or great the food is, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  CJ"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. I asked to have some substitutions and they did it without even thinking about it. Music is a little loud so if you're looking for a quiet place this isn't it. Can't wait for my next trip to Charlotte so I can go back. Went for breakfast on January 30th, 2015."}
{"text":"It's not high art, it's functional food and it's an option. I went during dinner at 6:30. I had a minimal wait and was seated at a booth by the jukebox whose selections I forgot to peruse. Some other yelper please address.  The booths are comfortable and wide, enough for the two 240lb male consultants behind me or maybe three 120lb uptown clubbing women. I mention the clubgoer set because by and large I think that's where the patrons are going to come from for this establishment. What Charlotte has greatly lacked is a place making more substantive meals than bar food after 10pm between Uptown and South End/Dilworth.  The menu is as varied as you would want with a 24 hour diner. In terms of the breakdown of choices it's 50% breakfast, 30% lunch, 15% entrees, 5% dessert. I'd like if the low calorie choices were more interesting than iceberg lettuce + cottage cheese + protein on top. Iceberg lettuce is nutritionally bankrupt & except for a iceberg/blue cheese/bacon wedge it's not a salad base.  My order of steak & eggs came quickly and to order meaning the steak was as rare as legally allowed. This brings me to my opening statement as to what to expect. It is functional food served here, not haute cuisine. The eggs were a shade runney, which I prefer, the steak cooked well but could have used some rub and the hashbrowns definitely needed something. These are individual nitpickings as there was salt & pepper on the table and the waitress asked if I wanted steak sauce. The one gripe I have is the biscuit. It's more of a bread dough consistency than a Flying Biscuit/Zada Jane/traditional dough. It comes buttered so the flavor is there but the mouth feel is more spongey than flakey. It's not bad, it's just different.  Th service is warm & friendly without being hovering.  Parking will be an issue as there 8 spots. Carson St stop on the Lynx is a short walk away and I expect to see a number of cabs dropping off late night patrons.  Dear Charlotte, if your durnk if firmly on and you're not in the mood for another street side hotdog you now have another option."}
{"text":"The Food was Delicious! But the initial service was lacking. We came in around 9:30pm and place was packed. We were seated immediately but it took someone 15 minutes to even ask us for water. Once we got a server, (CC) she was pleasant and apologized for the shift change wait. Nice smile and very sweet.  Once our order was placed the food was out in 10 minutes, Hot and Fresh. I had the Fried Chicken, Biscuit, Mash Potatoes/gravy & the Famous 4 Cheese Mac&Cheese. The chicken was delicious! Seasoned and cooked just right. The potatoes were smashed and not instant and the Mac and cheese was pretty good, not the best I've ever had but still good. That Biscuit however was one of the best! Yum yum yum yum yum! I'll be back to try the Shrimp and Grits.  I did taste my Husbands Chili Cheese Fries and I'll be back for those too! That Chili was GOOD!"}
{"text":"Less than a 1 - what a crappy place.  Went on Sat Nite around 2am and not enough help so I can't blame the waitress but seriously I was set at a dirty table and basically stacked the dirty dishes myslef and almost shoved them to the floor after 30 mins. Again not our waitress fault but horrible service and the food is not worth the wait .  You have been warned ."}
{"text":"This is definitely a late night spot. Generally speaking, I wouldn't want to eat what they serve unless I had some liquor in me. And, the silver prefab pod thingey is a trippy novelty if your'e in a \"creative\" mindspace. The inside is lit with yellow recessed lights accented with pink neon, so it's bright but not harshly so. Service was great and the food was acceptable. We ordered the uptown breakfast(s) and I had a side of mac n' cheese. The portions were smaller than I had anticipated but I don't suppose you really want large portions of the kind of foods they serve. The mac n cheese was mostly butter topped shredded orange cheese which I assume was cheddar.  Coffee was excellent and our server was prompt about refilling. They have just obtained a liquor license so beer and liquor will become available in the coming weeks.   The dining experience was totally satisfactory for 'late night.' And, as music lovers, my party and I were digging the gold record montages.  Driving here is not recommended as there were at least 5 police cars on patrol and limited parking."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago had lunch with my sis and niece at Midnight Diner.  Was fabulous!  Loved the atmosphere and the food.  The dessert was yum, yum, yum and the grilled chicken sandwich was delicious.  Anxiously awaiting another visit."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I checked in at Midnight diner, and I am currently beginning my review as I sit at a booth in sleek, but old fashioned diner. As we entered, I was surprised at how big the place was. Everyone was extremely friendly, and we escorted directly to a booth. Despite the fact that we were we seated immediately, it took a while before someone came and took our drink orders.  When our was finally taken, it seemed as if it took a while for our food to arrive.  It can be a very frustrating feeling when you arrive at a locale before others and you see them get their food, finish their meal and pay before your own food ever arrives!  I was literally salivating in anticipation for our meal to arrive at our table.  Once it finally made it, my girlfriend and I immediately dug in.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders w/fries and a side of collard greens.  She said the collard green were just okay... they were not seasoned with any kind of meat and were bland. She enjoyed the tenders, saying they were, \"moist and tender\".  I tasted the chicken tenders and can concur - they were excellent.  Some of the best tenders Ive had around Charlotte.  However, we both gave the fries a thumbs-down.  They weren't crisp or hot.  In fact they were the exact opposite - soft and room temperature.   I ordered the Midnight Special with my eggs being scrambled w/cheese, bacon, hash browns \"covered and smothered\", and I was allowed to substitute a pecan waffle for just $.50 more.  Everything was cooked to my liking.  The hash browns were PERFECT.  I thought the eggs were a little hard.  I prefer my scrambled eggs light and fluffy.   The best feature of Midnight Diner is its versatility.  You can go there early in the morning before work, for lunch, or late - after a night of carousing with friends.  In addition, they have any and everything you could possibly want to eat, and breakfast is served all day!   I felt like my experience at Midnight Diner was lessened by the service, because the food was above par.  Yes, our waitress was extremely cordial, but she was anything but prompt.  I went there looking to be in-and-out quickly and was greatly disappointed.   In closing, I've heard so much good stuff about this spot that I def want to go there again.  I'll just go when I've got a whole day to burn and I'll try to sit in a different section."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere make the delicious and affordable food taste even better. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot! Right after seeing a show, looking for a place to get our grub on, we found this place and Daaang! Awwwwwww snaaaapppp! Them shrimp and grits taste so good make a grown man cry. If I'm ever on death row... This is where I'll get my takeout for my last meal. It's that good. ILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"The Black & Bleu was really good. Burgers cooked well done by default but still turned out delicious. Burgers are smaller than average but jammed pack with flavor. Had a pineapple mimosa, which is way better than traditional orange juice. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I found this place very good. I had the chicken wrap it was great!!!!. Its a dinner car setup so its alittle cramped and lound at times but service is very good. You should be happy here"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant,staff is really nice,and the shrimp grits dish is so good..also that place is open 24/7 which is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down Midnight Diners Fried Chicken is wayyyy better than Price's Chicken Coops!!! The vegetables are great too.   When it comes to the dessert you will need to order the Strawberry shortcake cheesecake when you first place your order. Every single time I've waited after my meal to order the cheesecake it gone!!!"}
{"text":"Great diner. Shrimp and grits were amazing. Want to crowded and a great menu selection. Friendly staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere, excellent food, and as an added bonus they serve beer and liquor. Our receipt said our server was Latosha, and she was incredible- made what would have normally been a great experience something even more extraordinary with her incredible personality. Enjoyed this place thoroughly and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at the classic Midnight Diner in uptown. We chose to eat here during the daytime/lunch hours due to easy parking, but unfortunately there were no spots. And the lot there charges $7 for 12 hours. Why not have an hourly system for when all the spots are taken?? Fortunately we parked and had waited around long enough that spots opened up in the \"free\" parking and then finally headed inside.   The Midnight Diner really has that old school Diner feel that I love. Their menu followed the same theme with a large breakfast offering and sandwiches and entrees as well. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries. The fries were really good and seasoned well, but the chicken tenders were not crispy at all and in fact we're kind of limp. I had to use a fork to dip them in the sauce because they kept falling apart.   For the price and atmosphere, I would definitely still come back, just probably would pick a different meal."}
{"text":"Loved the nostalgic feel. Breakfast was delicious. Belgium waffle was perfectly browned and shaped, so were the pancakes, and French toast. It was a very busy place, yet we were still sat and served very quickly."}
{"text":"THE Place to go in Charlotte for some good comfort food. You have to get the Fried chicken it's a must! The biscuits are delicious too and the grits and friendly service. It's a different kind of crowd after hours but I have still experience good service. Anyone visiting I will always take them to the good ole Midnight diner"}
{"text":"As a first timer in Charlotte, my friend suggested this place to me... even though I was very skeptical since it reminded me of Silver Diner.  It was busy the night we visited but was seated in about 7 minutes.  Looking through the menu... I wasn't sure what I wanted but after checking Yelp and suggestions, a lot of people said Shrimp and Grit, which I asked the waiter on her suggestion and she also recommended it.  Yelp and the waitress definitely did not disappoint me, this was the BEST SHRIMP AND GRIT I have had in a LONG TIME.  Super flavorful and added some eggs on the side with my meal!  TRY IT!"}
{"text":"In town for weekend and stayed at nearby hotel.  Loved this spot so much came back every day for breakfast."}
{"text":"After a few Midnight Diner experiences, I am fully convinced that there is absolutely nothing served at the diner that is anything short of utterly delicious!  My favorite menu item so far is the chicken and waffles. (But, instead of wings, I order chicken tenders. It requires ordering the chicken tender appetizer and then an extra waffle. #lifehack) In addition to the crazy good food, in my experience, the staff is always efficient, helpful, and all-around great!  If you go around brunch time on the weekends, though, be prepared for a wait!"}
{"text":"Got the bleu buffalo chicken sandwich and it tastes like soap or the bleu cheese was fresher than fresh. Got fries that were frozen and gross. First time trying this place in a drunken crave but would never return. Most likely the worst items I have ever had after 10pm.  15 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"My 1st meal in Charlotte while visiting for the holidays with family.   Loved the Biscuits and gravy but lost my mind over the grits!"}
{"text":"Best grits ever, since New Orleans. French toast was OK. Mine's better. Very small, but surprisingly, they were able to cram a bunch in. In from out of town, so we stopped for breakfast before checking out the grace covenant church."}
{"text":"A Charlotte institution! 24 hour real diner food. Highlights are their spicy shrimp & grits, chicken & waffles, pancakes, etc. I wouldn't recommend showing up either too late in the morning or too late at night, or you'll be waiting in a pretty long line. It's worth the wait if you want some classic grub."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time on Tuesday and it was quite an experience. While first walking in, it reminded me of Waffle House, however the environment was different and I don't believe it is a chain restaurant. My server for the morning was a woman named Dana, and she was very nice, respectful, helpful and patient (because the person I was with was ordering a large amount of food). She even helped him figure out how to get everything he wanted at the lowest price possible. He ordered some of the chicken wings they have on the menu, and they were some of the best looking chicken wings I have seen in my life. Plus they weren't baby wings, they were full large sized wings. I wanted to try them but sadly, I'm allergic to wheat. My food (hashbrowns and bacon) was good. I had already eaten prior to going to the restaurant, therefore I did not order much. My food was great though and so was service."}
{"text":"Food is more than adequate. I had chicken and waffles. It's a nice change of pace for a late night spot instead of ihop or waffle house. The selection is huge. Breakfast and brunch items as well as soul food offerings. The music is too loud and our waitress didn't have the best attitude. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Any chance we can stop here we do.  Love the shrimp and grits!!   Breakfast is always good.  Love the Greek omelet.    It can be very busy on Sundays but the wait is worth it.  Classic dinner food with good service"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about Jersey are the diners. This diner was shipped on the back of a semi from Jersey to Charlotte and I am so glad it did! I visited with my husband for breakfast one cold morning and even though the line was out the door, it moved pretty quick. We got shrimp & grits, hash with ham, onions, eggs, french toast and some other stuff. The french toast was HUGE and delicious. It is a must-try. The staff is friendly and although it can be a little loud it is worth it for the delicious food. GO FOR THE FRENCH TOAST!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast, and it was fantastic!! Worth any wait for sure! Come hungry and you will not be disappointed.  Their pancakes and biscuits are to die for!!  I had their omelette and hash browns and it was great!  We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a place that's pretty good at what they are - a retro diner with the predictable treats of burgers, milkshakes, club sandwiches and fried chicken fingers. Service was good, food was exactly what you expect and they do have a new age juke box. Decor matches the theme too."}
{"text":"Don't sleep on the diner!  I wasn't feeling that great but still wanted a traditional meal, so I ended up here on Thanksgiving day.  I guess everyone had the same idea or just wanted breakfast before their evening meal?! I don't know but the line was out the door and on the sidewalk.  I just wanted takeout and ordered the Thanksgiving special, turkey, stuffing, greens, mac n cheese.  It took just as long for takeout as it did to dine in, but other than that the food was really good, just what I wanted despite the long wait.  Although it was crazy busy, the staff handled it like champs with a smile and great attitudes."}
{"text":"Was looking for something to eat after a hanging out downtown Charlotte late one Saturday night.  We arrived around 130am and had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.    This diner offered more variety than your typical Waffle House.  Friend and I shared the chicken and waffles, and chicken strips which came with fries.  The waffle wasn't good, it was too airy... the chicken wasn't fresh.  The chicken tenders and fries were actually tasty and seasoned well.  The ranch was fresh made and was also tasty.  The sweet tea was good, not too sweet and wasn't watered down.  There was nice R&B music playing that night, which added a nice twist to the dining experience.  We left around 230 and there had to be 50 parties in line waiting to be seated.  There were also several police offices present to ensure things remained orderly."}
{"text":"Went at around 4 today and it wasn't packed like it would've been in the evening (which is a good thing)! Food came out super quick and tastes fresh. Our server, Tiffany, was very sweet and attentive too. Will be coming back again, probably for some late night munchies.. Heh."}
{"text":"One of the worst diners in charlotte. Always crowded, loud and dirty. Everytime we go we get horrible service and nasty cold food. Will never go again. Tried giving it a second chance but it was an over failed attempt. If you want to be around rude, loud, obnoxious drunk people by all means go and try to make a good time out of it. But I do not reccomend it at all."}
{"text":"Great idea, horrible execution.... I'd give this zero stars if possible.  Came here late Saturday night/Sunday morning and nothing went right.  The wait was long, the waitress was terrible and forgetful, the refills never came, and the food was bland.  Great opportunity to put some grease on your stomach after a night of partying, but you're probably better off going home and grading a bowl of Frosted Flakes.  I'll never understand why this place is so popular...."}
{"text":"My first American diner. It was as if I'd walked into Pop's milkshake shop in Riverdale(Archie comics). In short loved it. Ordered the chicken with biscuits, steak and eggs (wish I'd ordered it medium rare rather than well done) and the hot cakes platter( we were 4 people). It cost about $60 (including the tip). Once again I ordered iced tea, can't get enough of the stuff. It was the perfect breakfast. Our server, Greg was great. Actually the whole staff was. I highly recommend it, and believe me guys, I do not like every place I go to eat. I just write reviews for ones I actually would go to again. Also I got a (2nd) refill in a disposable cup for my iced tea...i mean COME ON. Yay!"}
{"text":"Desperation = Going to Midnight Diner when sober  Ever noticed a mile long line extending from a chrome covered building with neon lights, at 2AM? That's Midnight Diner. It's a combination of drunken millennials pouring out from Southend for a final meal before stumbling home and people leaving the always lovely Uptown Cabaret, looking to make a second poor decision. I've had my fair share of late nights here, which I'm not too proud of, so this is coming from direct experience.  It's all of the typical diner fare you would expect to see, only none of it is done very well. My drunken 2AM alter ego, that would normally demolish an unholy combo from Taco Bell, has been able to see right through the facade that is Midnight Diner. Laughable fried chicken that's either been over or under cooked, over cooked hash browns, those lovely neon yellow hotel continental breakfast-style eggs, and dry waffles. A burger is probably your best bet here.  On top of all that, you will normally have to wait a good bit to get in the door and trust me when I say, it's not worth it. One thing that has always been consistent is the service. They are trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible, which I can appreciate. You're better off heading South about a mile to Skyland Family Restaurant, where you can at least take advantage of the people watching and finally getting that unforgettable Snapchat story.  Prime location with an always boisterous crowd, long wait, and half-assed food...2/5."}
{"text":"Is a review really necessary?... check the lines out the door when you pass by the place. (normally Sundays and late weekend nights).   You may catch this joint on an off night, but that's okay because the food is still good. Not the best.... but good."}
{"text":"Midnight Diner continues to score #1 in my gotta-go-to diners in Charlotte.  I get it's not everyone's cup; however, I love the food, the spirit of the staff, the great sounds from the juke, and the overall vibe of a place hitting on all cylinders.   I typically hang at the counter just to absorb the action.  Contagious.  Thanks CC for attending to me today.  Way up on my \"Give 'em a whirl!\" meter."}
{"text":"Visiting here in Charlotte, my cousin takes us here to eat after getting off plane.  Was totally amazing!  I got breakfast food.  Everything was wonderful, the service, staff, patrons...all so wonderful.  The grits are the best I have EVER had!  Very creamy, and thick. Yummmy"}
{"text":"There for Sunday brunch this past weekend. Knew I was at the right place when we drove up! Parking lot and outside was packed . But the wait was less than the 15 mins quoted for a party of four! Ordered the \"Bubba\" the Hashbrowns w and the sausage gravy were perfect. No seasoning necessary!  PS: Forgot to mention the size of the platter!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot. The theme is great with the atmosphere and music. Walked in for lunch was expecting a wait but they sat us down really quick. Our waiter was amazing too and the food came out really quick. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Those chicken wings where so moist it was amazing. I noticed almost half the people where ordering the shrimp and grits so I've gotta try that next time."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere.                                        ...I'm particularly fond of the chicken slider."}
{"text":"My 10 year old sez \"The food is delicious but you will probably eat so much of it that you will be full.\"  I had a bad turkey club earlier this week so I needed to wipe away that memory.    Great classic  diner vibe, good service."}
{"text":"Best grits ever! And Mona Lisa is the vibrant singing waitress with a sense of humor sure make you laugh!"}
{"text":"Great uptown  (downtown) location. Classic diner food. Service was a little slow, that's the only negative. Delicious biscuits. Very crowded on Sundays. Will return when in Charlotte. Friendly staff. Within walking distance to all uptown hotels."}
{"text":"This is a divey diner just like my favorite places in the dirty jerz.  Great music? Check. Singing waitress who always brightens my day? Check.  Service is dependent on what time of day you are here.  At night its a zoovie, during the day after 12 it is not so bad.  Their chicken biscuit is ridiculous.  The chicken is so fluffy and tasty that I cannot resist one whenever I go.  Their other chicken will sucker punch Price's and put it in a cobra clutch.  I love the traditional breakfast menu and I am sucker for their pancakes as well.  This is definitely a great place to stop feeling hungover and start feeling fat.  Oh what a trade off!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times at different hours of the day. I have had the fried chicken (tasty), the \"philly\" cheesesteak,  and one of their most talked about items...the Cajun shrimp & grits (Amazing!). As a northern I typically don't eat grits. If I do, it has to be made like my oatmeal or cream of wheat which is with butter and sugar. In this instance though, take it as it is. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The midnight diner is pretty much a 1am staple and always full on weekend nights. The patrons here are varied (the drunk, buzzed, almost-passed out, and people who just look like they got hungry in the middle of the night). I recommend getting filled up here if you've finished your night of partying and drinking. You'll feel much better the next morning. For the more sober customers though, the food is just okay. Servings are relatively large but I didn't care for the chicken and waffles. The chicken was decent--the classic Southern stuff. But, the waffles were sort of mushy like a defrosted eggo waffle."}
{"text":"Finally uptown has a late night spot to eat! I've been to the diner several times and the food and service is always good. Love the grits and and the open-face sausage, egg and cheese biscuit! I like that I can take my family there during the day and the girls and I late night!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast! Some of the best cheesy grits I've ever had! The corned beef hash with eggs was great. My husband and his friend shared coconut crunch French toast and loved it, I don't do syrup ;) we also had the biscuits and sausage gravy. I usually don't like biscuits, but this was GREAT. Our server did a great job too! GREAT GREAT GREAT. Everything!"}
{"text":"It was 1 in the morning and we waited for about 15 or 20 minutes for a table.  The place was packed.  I enjoyed the fast paces atmosphere and the music made you feel like you were in a hip nightclub.  We ordered Philly Cheesesteaks which were huge and very tasty.  The service was slow for us but that was not the case for the tables around us so I think our server was new or overwhelmed.  Even still this is a great place to eat in Uptown Charlotte.  I would give it more stars but with the service being slow I can't"}
{"text":"Jermaine was pretty f*cking cool. Shrimp and grits and coconut French toast was delicious. Great service and good times. Go."}
{"text":"Yeahh...the shrimp and grits ARE ALL THAT!!!  Never had grits so creamy!!!!  Firecracker shrimp(think that's the name) is also a good appetizer...shrimp is covered in a tasty sauce and they are kind of crispy...Yum!!  Mac n cheese was good too but needed a more cheddar taste.  Lil one had the peanut butter and marshmallow toasted sandwich...well I ordered it but she did not eat it...but that's just her being contrary. ...that sandwich was that bomb too...but on the kids meal.  Next time I want to try the Bubba!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth...sometimes I think it is great, other times I tell myself it is the last time I'll eat there.   Service can be amazing...or amazingly awful.  Food can be dinerific or downright awful. One morning I was craving a burger before work and at 7a it was perfection!  I had one after flying home Saturday night, could not even eat half of it, just no good. A big soggy mess.  Carbasaurus Rex would love this place...the majority of the menu is carb bomb!  My son had the chicken and waffles and said they were amazing!    Give it a try if you are in the mood for diner roulette."}
{"text":"We sat there for 15 min with our menus closed ready to order. We saw the 3 tables seated after us receive service and drinks before we even saw a server. I got up and mentioned it to one of the servers. Instead of saying something along the lines of ,\"I'm sorry about that let me find a server!\" She looked at me with an attitude and told me that we weren't her table....wow. Really helpful. We certainly walked out after that. Never even got the chance to eat the food or even drink the water. Now I never will. They lost my business."}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place. We stopped by, she  told me to try shrimp & grits so I did ! It was so good !!! First time ever trying shrimp and grits.  The prices were okay. I Paid about $13, the taste is indescribable. It had a taste of a world class resturant. This has to be the #1 item on the menu"}
{"text":"A real diner transported to this site. Very popular so you will need to wait to be seated either at the counter or in a booth. Once you do get you spot service is fast efficient but friendly. The place is crowded, bustling and noisy but that ads to the experience. Food us typical diner fare including breakfast all day with some interesting variations. Prices are fair but not a bargain . You go for the experience and for comfirt food in decent portions. Parking can be an issue with a paid lot behind with a few free spaces but free on tge weekend. Ask or go ahead and pay at other times.  If you want a meal at a diner, this is the place."}
{"text":"Okay, this newish diner I'm familiar with. It actually used to reside at a truck stop in  Kings Mtn where I used to live which is about 30 miles away. There are photos of the haul in the entryway. I was taken a back when I saw it nestled just outside of uptown Charlotte! What a great decision.  Apparently a great spot for post-bar hopping. As with any diner, you have the old fashioned decor and jukebox in the corner. The food is good, not great. The staff is good, not great. But it is usually a mad house when I frequent at 3am. There is usually a line at the front as any local will tell you. When you're tired and wore out from dancing your ass off at the bar, you come here for replenishment and good conversation. Then to bed you go ;)"}
{"text":"Jessica and Alisa are best servers in Charlotte! Great eats, homemade and reasonably priced. Relatively clean and you can be in and out in 30 minutes if you are on a time crunch.   I tip 20/30% here and will keep coming back for the superb service and food."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Charlotte for night life, I always have midnight diner on my mind.   By far my favorite thing is the shrimp and grits! They use a great blend of green and red peppers and just enough spice. This is paired with a fluffy biscuit on the side.  This time I tried the 2 piece chicken and waffles, and I will say again I was impressed. I am a pancake over waffle kind of gal, but their waffle had a nice taste and was cooked well! I added some hot sauce to the wings, and then devoured my meal."}
{"text":"Update: While the food is good here, the quality of service really bothers me. On more than one occasion I've been here between 2am-6am where they've been closed. Typically someone scribbles closed on a white piece of paper and tapes it to the door. More recently there was no sign, staff just inside doing whatever, get to the register and I'm told they're closed. Since there is a lack of 24 hour eateries here in Charlotte I'd really like to see consistency when it comes to operating hours. Otherwise when I am able to get food, I'm a fan of the grits, fried chicken, and French toast."}
{"text":"Get the livermush!! It is heaven! With the sausage biscuit, grits, and sweet tea..just what is needed after a long run!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed Midnight diner yet because I come here a lot. I think I'm actually the duke, if that gives you an indication of how much I enjoy / frequent this place. So, let's get this out of the way. The food is 5-stars ... and by food I mean Chicken and Waffles ... and by Waffles I mean French Toast. I could literally eat their Chicken and French Toast for any meal of the day and I already have. I'm guessing their other menu items are delicious as well, but why mess up a good thing. I'm dinging them a star because it gets a little cray at night. You literally have to get pat down by an armed police office in order to pick up your take-out at 2am. I mean, I'll do it because once again the Chicken and French Toast is bomb, but yeah I don't like mine with a side of potential stabbing / drive-by. I will say that there's some pretty good people watching in the after-club hours. All shapes, colors, ethnicity, creed, organisms, and nations of ratchet. From the trap stars to the drunken southern bell that missing a shoe. Priceless entertainment ...  All and all, Midnight is the quintessential diner and I urge anybody to give it a try if they're in Charlotte. If this review has proved useful to you, please show your thanks by providing me with an order of Chicken and French Toast. :-) ... just kidding.  but for real though ... :-|"}
{"text":"Been here only a couple of times even though we stay in the adjacent apartment complex lol. Probably that's why couldn't take this place seriously. But loved the food, it's proper diner food. Love their banana pudding and Death by chocolate cake more than anything."}
{"text":"So the shrimp and grits were great. Will definitely get these again. The pecan and regular waffles were great and slightly sweetened as my son and I do not eat maple syrup. They were light and fluffy and tasted great with nothing on them. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the mac and cheese. Although homemade and cheesy it had no flavor/ seasoning.  But it's nice the food came out fairly quickly, hot, and correct.  The servers all seem to have great attitudes."}
{"text":"I've been here several times when visiting Charlotte. There is always a line however, it goes pretty quickly. The food is still always good and they have a full bar. Their fried chicken is awesome as well. I would highly recommend if your in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I would drive 4.5 hours just for their Firecracker Shrimp! Absolutely to die for!! Every time I take a trip (after going to the Midnight Diner) I see if there is any route I can take that is near it just so I can get some of their food! Staff is so so so polite and helpful. Pricing is great for the amount of food they give you. This is my all time favorite place to eat! Worth the time to get there; worth the wait time; worth the money! Thank you so much for this delicious food! I got a taste of Heaven on Earth."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was very good, better than any other sould food place in the area.  The place was a little dirtier than it was a few years ago.  Sanitation grade is a borderline 90.  Floors were very dirty although it had not rained."}
{"text":"Stopped in accidentally, place is busy and packed.  We ordered the chicken fingers which was yummy but the fries came out cold.  Dad had the chicken salad which he said was ok and my daughter had the veggie burger which she said was ok.  Chicken was the best thing. Not sure I would return.  Lots of staff, most just talking and not working, but friendly."}
{"text":"Well Well Well, after writing a few other reviews today, my friend and I started to talk about places to eat and of course one of my favorite places in the Queen City has to be Midnight Diner. The selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner is to die for. if you try going here after the club lets out you might just die of hunger waiting to be seated....lol It is a diner though so don't expect them to move for Uptown to Pineville into an enormous building, this is not a China Buffet. I will say that it is larger than most Diner's that i visited up North. I have been here at least 5 times or more and still haven't made it off of the breakfast menu, when I here Diner I just think breakfast. I give them 5 Stars so you know what that means, they have free WiFi and Great Food. I always get a different waitress, but they all are so nice and great at what they do.   ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down this will be my new go to restaurant whenever I'm in Charlotte. I was being a fat girl. I had shrimp and grits, a wing and sausage gravy for my biscuit... hmmmm... The wait was a little long for well worth it. The only thing was my server looked dirty. And she would reach over our food to refill cups. I don't like anyone armpit over my food. Food was incredible still..."}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte 4 years ago I was a steady customer to this place. I was extremely happy there was a 24 hour diner in the neighborhood, but unfortunately this is not the case anymore.  This place has gone completely downhill since I moved to this city.  First and foremost, this place has attracted a lot of sketchy people in the recent years and has had its share of violence on occasion.  Aside from this, the food is poorly prepared in contrast to how it used to be, and the staff is nowhere near as friendly as my earlier experiences dining here. Last but not least, management is extremely unprofessional.  On my last visit the manager begins screaming at the top of her lungs saying \"this isn't uptown cabaret if you finished your food get the hell out of my restaurant!!\"  I understand they need to clear the space for new customers but this honestly made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  I've never even seen this kind of unprofessionalism in a restaurant before, not even in a Waffle House. If people are loitering in your restaurant, handle this properly like professional management should by going to each table to see who's already paid their bill....comon now!!!  The owners truly need to hire better management to clean this place up.  I give this place 2 stars just because it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"My sister and I had the pleasure of having a late breakfast today at the Midnight Diner. This was my first visit but it was sister's fourth visit. The food was incredible!!!! I had the \"Bubba\" and it was delicious. As a Southern Girl, I know my grits and these were some of the creamiest grits I'd ever tasted. My sister promised me that the Midnight Diner served the best coffee in town. The coffee lived up to it's hype. It was amazing.   I would have rated my visit higher but some of the staff members were absolutely RUDE-not to me but another patron. Apparently there had been some confusion with a call in order. When the patron came back due to the error, two of the waitresses, Lisa and Dana spent more time arguing with the patron than trying to rectify the issue . I found them to be abrasive and condescending.  I felt sorry for the patron and I wanted walkover and yell \"just fix it\". Watching the exchange was very uncomfortable and these ladies clearly need customer service training. Sometimes it's not about who's right but about just doing the right thing!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Nestled in the urban city, this restaurant seems like a small fast-food dinner but it packs a serious punch. They have a full menu and carry a full bar of adult beverages. On this trip to the diner, we had the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits. The chicken and waffles come with 2 or 3 wings and additional pieces can be purchased alacart. The shrimp and grits are probably the best in Charlotte and very delicious. The chicken and waffles is also very good but the best thing about this restaurant is the service. The servers are very nice, inviting and always accommodating. The only reason eye I can give this place is the parking. The free parking is very is very limited but there is a abundance of paid parking. It's great place and I do plan on returning."}
{"text":"Was a great place to grab a quick meal at the late evening hours! Menu has everything you could imagine and the service was excellent. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice. Once I don't remember (I had a little too much to drink) and the other time was for dinner. That one I did remember ;-) and I was sober so this is a LEGIT REVIEW!! I went with a party of 4 and around 9pm. We were seated right away, but beware- on weekends/late night/ Sunday mornings you will wait for a table.   I ordered the shrimp and grits and I thought they were awesome! Very good flavors. It was sweet (from the grits), but the sauce made it a tad spicy- just up my alley. There were about 8-10 shrimp in my dish so for the $12 this dish was a steal. When I return I will definitely order the shrimp and grits again. I've heard it's the token item here and they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I stopped by at 3:57am earlier today for breakfast.  I knew something was up when I arrived and there were multiple police there one with emergency lights on and everything.  I went to the door and they have a line of people going out the door with police crime tape up and handwritten signs saying to stay out until they call you.  Once you get \"called in\" you have to do limbo under the police tape.  They sat me down towards the end of the diner.  I don't mind the music selection but they had it blasting to the point of distortion.  I sat there waiting for anyone to come and take a drink order or food order for 12 minutes.  I ended up turning on one of my TV shows on my phone and watched for a while until Anesha came to take my order.  She had herself and another person saying she was in training.  I placed my order for The Bubba and she told me it would be out in a few minutes.   My food came about 14 minutes later and I still had not received my drink nor any silverware.  The person who brought my food asked what my drink was and went and got that for me.  The food quality was pretty good minus a weird taste in the hashbrowns.  I finished my food and a little while later Anesha brought my check and told me there was no rush.  I went to pay and was told I had to wait for my waitress and then she came over.  I attempted to pay like I have here before with Samsung Pay and was told that I couldn't do that.   The manager the older white lady copped an instant attitude and told me that I was a liar and that I hadn't paid with my phone.  I have proof on my phone and statement that I have in fact used it here.  They then decided to bring the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police in to talk with me about it.  I greeted them and told them the situation and they didn't have much to say.  The only thing that he had to say was that \"they have rules\" I told him I understood that but there were no rules up at all talking about tap and pay or paying with my phone was not allowed.  The manager then smacks her lips and says that oh well I guess he's getting a free meal tonight.  The police then told me to \"have a good night\"  In fact, I would have never stepped foot into Midnight Diner had I known this new fact.  I choose not to do business with establishments who are unable or unwilling to accept payment.  The thing about Samsung Pay is it acts just like a regular card swipe but the sad fact is Midnight Diners POS is enabled for mobile payments they just choose not to accept them and now I know this but there was no excuse for the management treating me like trash and calling me a liar.  They are the liars because I can show evidence that they accepted my phone as well as witnesses who were there.  The biggest problem here is the slow service and treatment of guests.  I can say with certainty that I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"The late night diner that comes with a side of adventure.   The food is your standard diner fare but the atmosphere is what gives this place its charm, especially if this is a late night stop for you. If you come here right after bars close, expect to stand in line for 20-30 mins, more if you have a group larger than 2-3.   Food is not bad but there is always something going on at the diner. When I went last time, there was some scuffle that occured on the outside. Usually it is just how drunk people are but being from the south it was somewhat entertaining to watch.   The staff is friendly and courteous and the space is somewhat small but works for a late night stop."}
{"text":"I highly recommend eating here. My family is visiting from Boston and we ate here for breakfast and we loved it so much that we went back for dinner. The kids had the French toast and and one plate definitely could have been ordered to split for all of them. Everything we ate was delicious. Absolutely not one complaint. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Oh blah Midnight Diner why you gotta be like this to me? At this rate I might as well go to Waffle House.  I stopped by here at 11 recently after watching a play in NoDa with my date. Since 11 was pretty early for the drunk hungry crowd we managed to get seated pretty fast and our waitress was charming if inattentive. I sadly stared at my empty water glass for half of the time I was there. So basically the same as usual. \"What made you lower your rating then Jimmy?\" you ask? Well my usual order is 2 eggs scrambled and tomato slices. Granted their tomato slices taste like tasteless slave tomatoes (yes that's an actual term, look it up!) but they don't exactly have many options that are friendly towards people who don't eat pork or much beef and just want a cheap quick late night munch. Well it's because when the check came and my bill was double what it usually was this time so I glanced down. Usually tomato slices are free, but apparently now they charge $2.00 for 3 all but tasteless tomato slices and this change wasn't listed anywhere on the menu? I think I might've understood like maybe 75 cents for them or something. You can go ahead and call me cheap, but I dare you to order some tomato slices when you go there and tell me they're even worth near $2.00!  Yeah so as much as it pains me to choose a chain over supporting a local business I think I'd much rather just go to WaHo, or even better Mattie's(please think about staying open 24 hours on weekends Mattie!). The prices and quality of food combined with shoddy service here don't really justify the convenience to me anymore."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've been here but still great.  Had to drop a sample of Mineral Sunscreen off this morning for analysys but after than, time for Breakfast.  Been a good while since we've dined at Midnight Diner and it was time for a revisit.  Dropped the sample off at 8:30 am and were here about 10 minutes later. Parking on the side was limited but did manage to score the last spot. My wife and I walked in and everyone was very helpful. I have upcoming hip replacement surgery so I'm using a cane but everyone jumped up and held doors for me while I navigated to a table. Very much appreciated.  Expansive menu with something for everyone including my wife who normally does not like breakfast.  I ordered the Western Omelet, Hash Browns and Whole Wheat Toast and all of this was made from scratch.  My wife had two eggs, over easy, Turkey Sausage, Toast and a Side of Fruit.  Everything was perfect The Omelet was very good, the Hash Browns were some of the best one's I've had lately.  Seems like most places are going to preformed Hash Browns from a Food Service provider but not here. These were the real thing.  Wife enjoyed her's as well and she confessed she occasionally enjoyed diner food.  Service was great and our Coffee Cups were never empty  Only thing I did not like and the restaurant had no control on that was that our table was next to an expanse of glass and it was 15 Degrees F outside so it was a bit on the chilly side.  Otherwise, great visit."}
{"text":"the coconut French toast creamy grits chicken wigs and waffles the mac and cheese I could keep going.............and so should you!"}
{"text":"Midnight Diner is a good bet morning, lunch, evening and late-night.  They have an extensive diner menu - a few of the standouts include chicken tenders, onion rings, greek salad and chicken and waffles.   The portions are generous and the service is fast - the only caveat, if you come for breakfast or lunch on the weekend, you'll likely have a 30+ minute wait."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming one of our favorite breakfast spots. I've been stuck in a rut our last few visits. I get the special which has two eggs, your choice of breakfast meat, grits or hash browns or fruit, and pancakes.   The grits are some of the best I've had outside of my own kitchen. And the pancakes. Oh, they are fluffy and delicious and the perfect treat at the end of my meal for this pregnant lady."}
{"text":"Great diner food with excellent taste. Came on a Sunday for lunch with a line out the door. Did not wait very long. Great food, hash browns cooked in butter and not an oily mess. Disappointed the \"old fashioned maple syrup\"  is the gooey mess that is not real maple syrup. The pancakes are good, but not with goo. Tried the onion rings and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Love...love...love!!! Best place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Always happy with food and service. They are quick and very hospitable. We recommend this to everyone we know and they fall in love too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has one of the best shrimp and grits I have ever had!  The service is quick and prompt. I would highly suggest going on a weekday morning when it is not that busy so you can truly enjoy the experience.   Though I have only been once, I can honestly say I've been sold on the shrimp and grits alone."}
{"text":"Probably the best grits in Charlotte outside of The Flying Biscuit. I almost always order breakfast here because they have NEESES LIVERMUSH! Ok. I know, I know but I'm still gonna eat it and I'm still gonna not read the package because I still don't wanna know exactly WHAT livermush is lol.   Midnight Diner is always poppin. It's open 24-hours and they have a great menu so people are literally in here 24-hours a day. I'm a huge breakfast/brunch fan so the fact I can get it anytime here is a big plus! I always had great customer service and it's always been clean. They even have a jukebox! Today the sanitation score is a 93 (idk what that's about but um...) The only reason I'm giving 4-stars instead of 5 is because subsequently since they're so popular there is almost always a wait and parking is limited.  Seriously if you haven't eaten at Midnight Diner you are missing it!"}
{"text":"I am a \"fried chicken connoisseur\" and I can tell you that this was one of the best fried chicken I've ever had!  It was crispy, but not greasy, super tender, and had just the right amount of salt.  The price was very decent as well.  I took the food back to the hotel so I don't know what the service or the atmosphere is like, but it seemed like a nice restaurant to me.  I'll definitely be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Bring your ear plugs, it's a diner so it's loud by nature but good GOD, the music is WAY TOO LOUD. Is it a club or a diner???   Eat outside."}
{"text":"Oh Midnight Diner... I've heard about this place and that it's so great after drinking and that's probably when I should've gone. Hubs and I went during the day because I was starving and I wanted good diner food. It was just okay, I wasn't too impressed for all I've heard. It was crazy chaotic inside and we were ignored for a good bit before we got seated. The food was not the best, even for diner food. I guess with all the raving about this place and the line out the door, I expected more. Our server was really, really sweet though. Won't be back unless I'm desperate!"}
{"text":"I loved the food.  They have the best French toast ever! The Turkey bacon and eggs were also good. If you can sit outside, that is best.  If not, know that t is really noisy inside."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to the Midnight Diner and it is phenomenal.  Jetaun is a master server very efficient accommodating, attentive, and positive. Robert was very helpful getting us seated on a busy Sunday and the food was no less than perfect."}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  Very, very lively atmosphere, especially late and in the wee hours. You'd best leave your expectations of a formal, proper restaurant at home. This is a very free flowing atmosphere. And the food is good. Fried chicken and shrimp with grits are my favorites."}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star spot, no doubt!  The breakfast sandwiches are awesome and at the right price too.  I also love the coconut French toast.  If you like a little spice you have to try the shrimp grits.  Their fried chicken is on point too.  I have nothing bad to say, this is a great spot to get your grub on."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I've been here several times. Early morning and late at night. It's always awesome! Parking isn't so bad either!"}
{"text":"Specific waitress could have been better but the atmosphere, food were great. Very clean facility and busy. Enjoyed."}
{"text":"Came here starving after a few bar stops and saw some recommend Coconut French Toast and Wings and goodness gracious it was goooodddd! It's worth a try if you're looking for somewhere open 24/7"}
{"text":"Went to the Diner yesterday for the first time. I have no complaints about the food. The grits are creamy, some of the best I've had. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. What I don't get is their fanatical insistence on \"No Substitutions\". To be fair, though, it may have been our server, who was not very pleasant even when he introduced himself. He was clearly irritated when 2 of our party asked for simple substitutions.   If my breakfast comes with either bacon or turkey bacon, what's the big deal if you get a Club sandwich and request turkey bacon and ask them to leave off the ham? The server rolled his eyes, and said he thought that might be OK. When the food came  out, though, none of the substitutions were honored. I think that's ridiculous. I know substitutions may slow up the kitchen, but come on...  The food was good enough, though, that we will be back. We will just know to order dishes that require NO SUBSTITUTIONS."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Very reasonable prices where you basically pay for what you get. Satisfactory food but nothing special to make a point to go eat at."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at all hours of the day and have never had a bad meal. I do always order breakfast foods though, so I can't say much about their other items. But they do breakfast well!! Their Belgian waffles are great and you can get fruit topping added which is the perfect pair. The fruit topping is an extra charge, and seems a bit high to me for what you get, but it makes the waffles even better so I get it. I usually order eggs over medium which I've come to find is hard get right while eating out. I ended up with over easy, but that seems to happen at every restaurant I order eggs at.  Today I got the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit which was bomb. They really do biscuits right here and give you good deal of cheesy goodness to go with. No gross clear, fatty bacon here, it's the good stuff. And my co-diners all enjoyed their \"Bubba\" (which I've had and is awesome everytime) and the coconut french toast which I tried and really is good. Doesn't taste overwhelmingly coconutty so you still get a nice crunchy sweet french toast on HUGE, THICK challah bread... so good!  I'd recommend Midnight Diner to any breakfast goer or late night eater. Every time I've been there it's been a good meal and the service is always on point with a friendly smile and quick service."}
{"text":"Some of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. The grits were southern style so they were creamy.  The shrimp were seasoned to perfection. I will always come here when I'm in the Charlotte area. The service was great and the place wasn't huge so I'm sure it gets crowded. Well worth the wait if need be."}
{"text":"We ate here and we didn't die, that's the best I can say.    We tried the so highly recommended fried chicken and some other stuff that for the life of me can't remember. The food was just OK, nothing great about it but there's no excuse for the complete lack of service in an empty restaurant - we got there around 1:45.    They sat us around the corner and out of sight  and promptly forgot about us. After a while I made a fuss and got a server to take our order ..... but he never came back....  .... and much later, almost an hour after we walked in the manager himself brought us our food. Which was like I said OK but not great. As for the decor, I'm just so tired of the old American Graffiti cliches, enough already!    I hear this place is terrific, when you're stinking drunk. Sober not so much."}
{"text":"Back again for some optic Midnite Diner specialty in my opinion which is shrimp and grits comparing them against those I've had in the Low Country around Charleston simply superb. The group so smooth and creamy shrimp is flavorful and plentiful. That's not to say that they don't make them in fried chicken and other Southern Comfort foods that I do enjoy also. The service is down home friendly, quick, and efficient. Its hard not to find something not to like and please your palate with the Midnight Diner and they always open and ready for you."}
{"text":"A busy, popular diner. There's a bit of a wait if you go on the weekends but if you get there early enough it's not too bad. The food was good. I had the pancakes and they were melt in your mouth fluffy. Good food and friendly service. Like someone else stated, the parking is bad but that's my only con."}
{"text":"3 words...chicken & french toast. Damn good, some secret batter and french toast was like cakeish.  It's not meant to be fancy, fly or edgy..it's a diner friends so adjust the expectations. It's a diner, like a greasy spoon..great for breakfast, lunch or late night after the bar is out bite and sober up food b/c its 24/7."}
{"text":"Fish & Grits w/ the creole sauce AMAZINGLY GOOD! Two downers the sweet tea is an express train to diabetes and the seasoned fries had to much salt. Experience was still good nothing that a glass of a wataaa and a new set of fries didn't fix.  Will return!"}
{"text":"MUST try chicken tenders!! Arrived late after a concert - seated immediately!! Our waitress was so nice!! Chicken tenders are out of this world and we also tried the cheeseburger sliders which were fantastic. Food was piping hot and the fries were perfect!! Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, great food. Our waitress came to the table once only to ask us if we wanted our ticket. We were sitting outside in the rain, and she never tried to get us inside or to a table with an umbrella. That's it for the negatives, onto the positives, the food. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was phenomenal. The grits were amazing and the shrimp were great. The Creole sauce put it over the top for me! As for my girlfriend, well, she got the French toast and quite frankly; it was amazing. The bread was HUGE and it tasted great. All in all a good experience. I almost gave 3 stars because of the service, but the food was just too good."}
{"text":"Wow!  It's been a while since I've written anything, and why not start back up with the diner across the street from my apartment.  Since leaving Boston in September I've been trying all sorts of new places in Charlotte and this came to mind first.  It's an old style silver on the outside huge booths on the inside kind of place.  It is good for two things - hungover breakfast and I just left the bar and I'm starving! kind of meals.   For breakfast I always get the omelette with avocado and cheddar and hash browns.  My husband always gets grits which I think are gross but he loves them so they must be good.  I've also had the fried chicken and a burger there.  The fried chicken is good and the burger is just ok.  The service is great and everyone is so nice.  The sweet tea (which I've become an expert at since being here) is too sweet, you gotta cut it with water or you'll go into sugar shock.  All in all not a place to check out, especially when it's only a 2 minute walk from your apartment -  kids in Camden South End...this means you!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying this, the midnight Diner is probably one of the better staple restaurants in Charlotte. However my experience tonight did not reflect that. After being sat and refused to change my order by our server, Ashley - we then received beyond mediocre service.  Feeling somewhat stereotyped into the mold of \"black people don't tip\". Luckily a server by the name of Larry a.k.a \"Showtime\" managed to salvage what remained of an otherwise horrible experience. He definitely exempified the prototype of what anyone would call excellent service. Needless to say our server received no tip. Hopefully she learns something from her peers. Definitely will be back...and requesting \"Showtime\" as our server for the duration of his tenure there."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times since my last review, so I figured an update was in order. Midnight Diner provides tasty diner food at fair prices, but unfortunately the iffy and slow service really overshadows that.  FOOD/PRICES I'll start with the best part of Midnight Diner: the food. I have tried a fair share of the menu, and everything tastes great. The fried chicken is crisp and well-seasoned, the burgers are juicy and topped with fresh toppings, the sides are prepared well, etc. The prices are also fair for the most part, which is great. Dessert is a bit on the expensive side, though. There really is not much more to say here: excellent diner food at fair prices.  SERVICE The service at Midnight Diner is incredibly slow. It's not the kitchen, as plates frequently pile up in the window, and it is not a result of the place being understaffed. Whenever I bring a friend to Midnight Diner who has never been, he/she always remarks how many staff the place has. I think it's just poor training and bad management. I had the unfortunate experience of eating during a shift change once, and it was a disaster. No one knew who the host/hostess was, no one knew which tables they had, no one knew who was supposed to be cleaning, etc. Ordering dessert, getting a refill, or trying to pay is always a nightmare because of how slow and absent the servers are.  Overall, I really like Midnight Diner's food, but the incredibly slow service prevents me from going often."}
{"text":"I was absolutely devastated by Midnight Diner- my kiddos and I went there after a long day of scuba diving. For whatever reason, the restaurant couldn't fit a family of thirty, and the staff was equally unequipped. We all ordered half a baker's dozen milkshakes, and it took 7 years for the staff to make them all. There was only one problem- the shakes were all chocolate, even though we clearly ordered vanilla. The service was fast paced and fun, with friendly faces serving our ultimately disappointing milkshakes. Overall, we had a great experience here and I hope to head back for chocolate shakes. Maybe I'll go after tomorrow's extreme badminton practice?"}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff very down to earth. The customers are from all walks of life and you do not feel like you are out of place. I got the burger and fries with waffles on the side..lol. The burger and fries where fresh. Fries home cut delicious. The ranch dressing is then best you can drink it. My daughter got the shrimp and grits, they where creamy and had a little kick to them. My younger children opted for the breakfast pancake eggs and sausage and they ate them all up. My party and I really enjoyed our food we will return."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, I love the location. As soon as you walk in, it feels like you've stepped into an old movie. The music is pretty loud, and the wait staff are singing along (which annoyed my friend a little). Its an extremely comfortable place to be.   The food is really good, I had the shrimp and grits (something i have to try if its on any menu), i also tried the collards which were really good but spicy.  It was in a creole sauce and it was so rich and creamy. The amount of heat in the creole sauce was medium, not as spicy as the collards.   If i stayed in Charlotte this would definitely be a place i would visit once a week."}
{"text":"Fabulous diner that doesn't disappoint.  My brother enjoyed his midnight special dinner and a strawberry milkshake.  My GF really liked her slider which was the perfect size for her appetite.  My country fried steak was OK, but actually it was no where near as good as I had expected and hoped for, especially for the price ($9.99).  The beef was a bit tough and the breading wasn't crispy.  The gravy was ok, but usually is really salty and has a bit of kick to it as a result.  Despite my let down, everyone else's food was great and our server was really nice and attentive.  They also serve alcohol and was a steal at $2/beer or $1.50 for Sam Adams.  We didn't imbibe any, but it was nice to know the bargain was there.  This is a great place to hit up after going out in uptown.  The last time we went to a dump formally known as Waffle House on N. Tryon St. so this was a great experience."}
{"text":"The breakfast is outstanding, you have to try the Bubba and the midnight special, food was very fast to come out and was kid friendly  Angela our waitress was very friendly and great interaction with our kids  Overall I would say the best tasting breakfast in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Never filed a Yelp review before.I have been to midnight diner countless times. I called in an order late one Saturday night, knowing that they would probably be very busy. I showed up and, as according to their policy, waited outside for my order to be ready, accompanied by two police who were guarding the door. After a good bit of time passed, I tried to speak to the host desk about the progress of my order, only to be very aggressively denied access by one of the police. Time comes and several thwarted attempts at speaking with an employee of the business come and go(gotta love cops) and I have been standing outside for forty five minutes waiting for a to go order that I was quoted ten on. Finally a more reasonable police officer offers to find a manager for me, amanager comes outside and inquires about people waiting for Togo food. My food had been ready for twenty minutes and I had been unable to access it and even unable to access an employee to ask about it because of one of the hired police officers guarding the door like a bridge troll.The food and the service are always good here and the management was very gracious in this particular instance. I just hope going forward that they scrutinize a bit more about what type of security they hire.  PS my food, upon receiving it after this whole ordeal, was still delicious."}
{"text":"The two stars I awarded Midnight Diner are due to its kitschy, retro exterior. It's just how I would imagine a diner in the 50s or 60s to appear, aluminum siding and all. There is plenty of parking on the side and a cool neon sign.  When I walked through the door, I was immediately greeted by my disappointment at unmet expectations. The floor and windows were dirty, the white walls severe and abrasive, and the bathrooms horrendous. We almost left after seeing the bathrooms but instead alerted management and decided to stay.  I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit and my boyfriend ordered two eggs, bacon, well-done hashbrowns and white toast. I ordered half of a grapefruit but the waitress returned and said they were out of grapefruit. While the food was brought out expediently and made to our satisfaction, there was nothing special or memorable that could make up for the failed interior.   Midnight Diner is open 24 hours/day, and obviously caters to those late-night cravings. But trust me, your drunkenly made scrambled eggs or mac-n-cheese, enjoyed in the comfort of your home are the better option."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday nght like at 3 am...   Get the BUBBA... how can you go wrong with sausage gravy, biscuits, cheese scramble...  service is terrible"}
{"text":"I have heard a ton about this place and it is always packed anytime I pass by it. I finally made it here and tried the Coconut Crunch French Toast with Fried Chicken. The meal was extremely good and only $11 so pretty cheap for how much food it was.   I had the deep dish pecan pie for dessert and it left a little bit to be desired. It wasn't bad but I would recommend trying one of the other pies."}
{"text":"Awesome - Go see Mona, the best waitress ever! Can'y wait to get back for some chicken and waffles!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great!!!!! The music was great!!!! The staff was great!!!! I had never tasted chicken and waffles but I was super impressed.  The only reason that I didn't give them a five was that the drinks were strong so they did the trick but it was like taking a shot more than having a mixed drink."}
{"text":"This place has got the best fried chicken but food alone don't make a great dining experience this place is so loud until you have to yell to speak to the person next to you on top of having the jukebox turn up to the max. We order the family size chicken dinner which was enough for 4 people it came with 8 piece of the chicken 4 biscuits but only two individual sides SMH and to substitute the breast and wings for dark meat is an additional $5 call me crazy but breast cost more my service was awesome my food was fresh in hot and I will go back maybe doing today when it's not a club and a restaurant at the same time"}
{"text":"This place should get a 2 1/2 star, I love the hours this place is open but the food is not consistent.  A friend of mine orderd food to go from this place and I had a few bites of her fried chicken and I was really impressed with the flavor and texture that I decided to order a plate to go.  My plate was really disappointing, my fries were room temperature and my fried chickens coating wasn't all the way browned, it was that yellow color before it's full cooked, it was soggy and greasy as if it wasn't cooked on a high enough temperature or something and the flavor tasted like cooking oil. Surprisingly the chicken was cooked all the way through but the coating was not.  Didn't really matter though because it tasted so bad I couldn't eat much of it. Not sure if I'll try again."}
{"text":"Our waiter was fantastic,  the food was to die for. My mom and me went for lunch there for the first time so we wasn't quite sure what to expect but I'm glad we went. I had shrimp and grits and they was absolutely delicious,  I mean roll your eyes delicious lol. My mom had breakfast and she's a picky eater amd she enjoyed her food so much.  The atmosphere was very pleasant, clean, and playing old school r&b ( real music ) lol. Took my brother home a fried chicken dinner and let me say this is the closest to my grandmas southern fried chicken that we will ever get. The cook really has a blessed talent and loves what he does. Oh and the collard greens oh man to die for, and they wasn't cooked with any kinda meat, which is hard to find in the south. So I will definitely recommend and my mom and me has a new restaurant for our mother daughter day out."}
{"text":"Although super-busy, Midnight Diner is WELL worth the wait!  The food was great and so was the staff!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is so yummy~  & the service is awesome too. There is this really sweet and cute waitress there named Kriss!!! She's the best!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to restaurant when I'm feeling hungry after midnight! It's best to go before 2, because that's when the clubs close and there will definitely be a line out the door! I have been several times, but the most recent was so funny! We were sat (almost immediately) - just 2 of us. And the waitress - I cannot remember her name - welcomed us with open arms! She got our drink order and we needed a few minutes (well I knew what I wanted, but he didn't) to order.  I got the eggs, grits and bacon with a side of toast. Eggs over hard. I don't know if that's on the menu, but that's what I wanted (and I think she made it work). Everything was delicious! The grits are hands down my favorite - add a little cheese and I'm in heaven!! I ate everything and I was so full! My fiancé wanted the chicken and waffles (and she suggested to get French toast instead) so he did. He said it was way better with the French toast and he will always order it that way!! There was a larger group - about 7- that came in after us. They were definitely a little buzzed but they were great entertainment! They sang along to every song that played and they were cracking jokes.  I will definitely be back when my 2 am hunger kicks in!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for a waffle but when we asked our waitress for recommendations, she said the fried chicken was delicious.  And then I saw they had hand battered onion rings, so I abandoned the waffle and went for the 1/4 Chicken White with onion rings and a salad as my side.  This also comes with a delicious home made biscuit.  Oh man... I had to stop myself from eating that biscuit after taking a couple of bites.  I'm glad I did because that fried chicken was one of the best I've ever had.  It was light and crispy and juicy and tender.  I could go on but then those onion rings were absolutely delicious too.  My fried food feast was so absolutely enjoyable.  And my waffle craving still has not been quenched so.. next time.    Service was good and friendly.  Our server never let our cups go beneath half.  She was great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the expectations are of the other reviewers, but it's a diner, for goodness sake! It's open 24/7 and it serves up some of the best breakfast I've ever had. I selected the breakfast that comes with two eggs any style, choice of meat (I had bacon), creamy grits, and two pancakes, except I opted to switch out the pancakes for a biscuit, and added on sausage gravy. Wow. When the menu says creamy grits, it's true! They are rich and creamy, perfect for a Southern gal like me! The sausage gravy was some of the best I've ever had. The service was just right, not too much, not too little. I would definitely return. On a side note, I saw a guy there eating breakfast.  He had scrambled eggs covered in ketchup (LOL) and was drinking a Sam Adams! That's the beauty of a diner: you can have whatever you want, whenever you want (as long as local law allows)!"}
{"text":"Long wait, no ownership, no one cares.   We were seated for 15 minutes before having to flag down a waitress.  We were then handed off twice, and finally served drinks.  Five minutes later, they took our order, including drink refills (which never arrived).   After another 15 minutes, during which time they checked with us on our orders twice and never brought an appetizer, we said we were leaving and asked for a check for the drinks.   We got a check for the whole meal.   Never again."}
{"text":"I try not to go to extremes when reviewing things; when those around me pile on the criticism, I try to find a silver lining. But it's hard to find anything that went right on my first visit to Midnight Diner.  We were seated promptly. That's the good news. My guest and I both ordered a mushroom swiss burger for lunch: Hers all the way, mine with lettuce and no other trimmings. She got fries, I got onion rings. Coffee for her, Diet Coke for me.  Then we waited. And waited. About 40 minutes. Lunch rush? It was busy, but not that busy.  When our food finally arrived, it was all wrong. Her burger came with mushrooms and swiss, but no toppings. Mine came with the lettuce, but no mushrooms. By the time we realized it, the waitress was gone. Five minutes later, my guest was able to flag her down about the condiments. She scurried away, presumably to remedy the mix-up; the condiments never scurried back.  To call my burger skimpy would be a disservice to skimpy burgers. The burger was sliced in half, and after one bite of the first half, I was left with mostly bun. Maybe the left half of that particular cow would be meatier...  The waitress did re-emerge eventually to refill our drinks. She offered to bring me another Diet Coke. She brought Dr. Pepper instead. The straw was nice, though.  It's a shame: I've been waiting for a good all-night diner in Charlotte (other than Landmark). I guess I'll keep waiting."}
{"text":"This is a cool 24/7 restaurant with great food and an awesome look and atmosphere that will take you back to the \"good ole days\" the only thing that sucked was my waitress she was really crabby and not that friendly other than that it's a great place."}
{"text":"The service was excellent!! Very festive! The food was good except a waffle is to be severed hot enough to melt butter and the chicken was definitely reheated not freshly cooked."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast food here. Grits are AMAZING. I have a very high standard for grits, so that should be an indicator. Also the french toast is some of the best I've ever had. It's not just regular loaf bread. It's huge fat slices, and worth every penny paid. I was not disappointed with this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm adding to my previous review. Today I ordered something I will never try again. Their spaghetti bowl was disgusting. Don't get it."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm in Charlotte. It's a 24 hour spot that has some of the best pancakes i've tasted. The shrimp and grits are also delicious! Be prepared for a wait, it's a popular spot in town. The staff is always friendly and they move the crowd quickly. The prices are great and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the food here...and was soooo disappointed this morning when me and my friend randomly decided on a 5am breakfast excursion, and they had no hot water.Per the waiter, they only had coffee and bottled water...meaning no waffle mix, grits, or a whole lot of stuff (I will assume including clean dishes and silverware? :/). Though the staff was fairly friendly about it...it did nothing for my 5am \"grits fix\". Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth... normally  nice spot though"}
{"text":"Good place to dine in with friends its good here you have to wait its popular dinner its loud as well"}
{"text":"Why two stars you ask??? - The \"ghetto\" attitude and service was horrible! .The hostess (I am using that word loosely) did not greet my wife and I. She mumbled how many? and turned on her heels and walked away toward the table (the fat one with the horrible wig-yea her). The server Greggggggg (how it is spelled on his name tag) was unattentive and disinterested. The saving grace was the delicious food. However, I don't do ghetto and for that reason I will not return."}
{"text":"The service was horrible!!! Thursday night must be one of the worst nights unless they are like this all time. We got no spoons our cups were filthy dirty and the tequila shots we ordered was not even shots they were so small. I don't care if it's a slow night or not no excuse then I asked for limes and they say they don't have any limes but another table just asked for limes and they got them?   Will never go here or bring my friends here ever!"}
{"text":"AKA the 8th wonder of the world... Midnight Diner is like Disney for drunk/hungry young professionals after a night out in Crown Town."}
{"text":"Nice spot amongst the South End haunts that occupy the area. It's wanna-be retro, but that works for me!!!   I went on a Monday during lunchtime, and it wasn't bursting at the seams busy like many places South End, so I was happy because a a less busy place usually also means better service.   My waiter was a bit off putting, but the food came out soon and this is a diner, not Morton's so it's okay.   I ordered the handspun Strawberry milkshake which was delian! It tasted like it had real strawberries in it and the ice cream was thick and wonderful, as I could barely put my straw in the shake because it was so thick! Major kudos for that!!!!  I decided on the classic chicken and waffles....which were good but nothing spectacular....the dish definitely met \"diner\" sized expectations. The wings were crispy and hot just like I like 'em. The waffles here are thin, not Belgian style, but I actually felt that complimented the wings so that it didn't become a gluttonous meal...  The place was very \"Americana\", and looked like a regular recreated retro restaurant with Elvis posters everywhere.  The only negative is the parking, I wasn't there during a busy time and even then their tiny parking lot was full, so nighttime parking may be a hassle for those not arriving via light rail.  Go to Midnight Diner!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim based on a friend's suggestion, and I'm very glad I agreed to go! We arrived at the diner late at night, and was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a good mixture of past and present, and the place was packed! Definitely a good sign for someone who wants good food.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and didn't have to wait long at all. Though maybe time passes quickly because my friends and I were talking so much...  Well, whatever the case, the food was so good! I'm not exactly a chicken and waffles connoisseur, but those may have been among  the best chicken and waffles I've had.   Oh they also deserve some brownie points for the way they train their employees. My friends and I happened to visit on a training night, and it was so nice to see the new hires being guided thoroughly and patiently by the experienced employees. A completely different experience from that one time I worked in the fast food industry... *shudders*"}
{"text":"The place is honestly okay when you can get some service. They have a crew of half wit waitresses that I heard arguing on who was suppose to do their job and then decided to not do it all! My husband and I stood there 10 minutes being completely ignored. I very rarely get a night out anymore, so I turned around and left and took my business to Amelie's. At least there I'll get service and not a rude waitress that won't do their job and would rather gossip!"}
{"text":"I hate grits.  But I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE grits from the Midnight Diner.  If I could bath in them, I would.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place definately has the diner vibe but it does not have great breakfast. It can get very busy and servers may be delayed in taking your drink orders. Tight space but fairly cool diner set-up. Had the basics for breakfast and it was not good."}
{"text":"I only get the french toast and wings. The French toast is phenomenal. They use challah bread which is perfect. The wings are just okay."}
{"text":"We walked in for lunch expecting to wait for a table today.  We was seated right away.  Service was extremely fast.  For was very good for a diner.  Staff was very friendly. I ordered  Shrimp and Grits. It was very tasty and just enough kick to it.  My friend order wings and French Toast.  Wasn't enough for him to eat.  Only 2 pieces of French Toast and two little wings.  Wish there was more so I could have tasted the meal."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is odd. This place is way overstaffed but service is hard to come by."}
{"text":"I have been here in Charlotte for 6 years. This is the 1st time I have been to this diner. The grits here are the best I ever had. All of the food has a great taste and I loved every bit of it. I recommend this place to all that will come to Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"I was really hung over when I stumbled in here at 8am on a Thursday, I could have been a teensy bit inebriated still. I needed breakfast food and I needed it quickly. That is exactly what I got. I am not sure if they wanted us out of there b/c my friend was putting pancakes on his face or they are really just that fast. They also serve beer and alcohol!? I didn't need any, but it was nice to know it was there. For those days when you need a Bud and biscuits and gravy or a gin and tonic with your waffles. Either way, delicious and necessary. Can't wait to go back and really look over the menu with a clear head."}
{"text":"When asking \"where do you go when you come to Charlotte?\" This place is always mentioned. Followed by \"GET THE SHRIMP AND GRITS!\" So, I did what I was told LOL!   For parking, there is a small parking lot in the front but you can also park in the rear area. I was told that we went at a good time (Saturday around 4pm) because if we waited longer, we would have had to wait. Everyone also says that this place is POPPIN' right after the club let's out especially since it is 24 hours. It's a great place to people watch.  You can tell that the waitresses were hustlers. They made sure they claimed their table and also made sure that you were helped. I ordered the Shrimp and grits and yes. YES. YES. .. y - e - s. Everything was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got a philly cheese steak and he said it was good. He also ordered mac and cheese and also another side of fries. The fries were \"basic\" and not really special, but they were good.  Shay, our waitress took great care of us also. She made sure that our glasses were full.   Bathrooms were clean and it was appreciated. The floors were also clean around the restaurant. Will def be back when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"You come in and they have like 4 documents with rules posted on them and \"crime stoppers\" tape up in the entry to keep you in place. The \"hostess\" put up the hostess booth up against the doors to keep us from entering and treated us like we were criminals for trying to enter the diner. No matter what the food tastes like it was not worth dealing with the way we were treated by the hostess"}
{"text":"I went to the Midnight Dinner one night after Yoga.  I probably should have gone before.  I enjoyed the fried chicken.  I did not like the mashed potatoes or the vegetable.  They could have provided as other post mentions some lemon pepper seasoning, garlic or something to give the vegetables a nice touch.  I willl probably go again just for the chicken."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  First off we waited an hour for a table not because it was that busy but because a family member of someone who works for the restaurant came and got seated before us.  I understand the game of the \"hook up\" but when we have 4 kids and a big party and the restaurant only accommodates 2 big parties... moving forward we sit to our table and it's cold as Christmas in NYC at this table.  To change things around Our waitress Tammy was the bomb!  She made our experience awesome!  She got the the AC turned down and just loved her job.  Some folks hate waiting tables, but she loves her job and her customers!  After being with her I felt it was a reason we had to wait.  The food was good too.  I had shrimp and grits and a side of country ham.  We had a party of 7, and our bill was $80... how nice.  Those hot biscuits was so good... we tipped her well because she changed our heart on this place especially visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This place is great! We had the Shrimp and Grits and the Bubba Breakfast. The biscuits are to die for and the gravy is wonderful. The shrimp and grits demand serious respect. Our server was Delorian. He couldn't have been nicer or more efficient.  We didn't have to wait at all, even though the place was crowded and he was swamped. We definitely plan to return for breakfast soon. Thank you so much for a great dinner and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Midnight Diner was highly recommended by several of my friends from Charlotte, so I was fairly excited when my parents decided to go to a diner Halloween night. From the exterior, it definitely gives you the look and feel of a classic diner. Wide open windows with the hustle and bustle of many people coming in during the late night. Parking is located directly to the right of the building if you facing the diner. We were seated fairly quickly on a Saturday night with no problems. The staff was very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We were seated directly next to the juke box which customers can pick songs of their choice and shake a tail feather if they'd like. Although, I'm sure that would be quality entertainment if a customer started dancing in the middle of a diner. Well, as far as the food, they offer a wide variety of choices from coconut french toast, to chicken and waffles, to desserts. I opted for the chicken and waffles which was I was very pleased. The chicken was crisp, juicy, and flavorful. You should definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for a classic diner. The leather seats, juke box, and fast paced service definitely helped. Can wait to go back and try the grits that everyone is raving about. Overall, good find in Downtown Charlotte that open 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"We always pass by when we went to uptown, but never had a chance to try it. So glad we did...they have the best fried chicken ever!!!!! So very crispy outside, and super juicy inside. Definitely need to try it if you come here. Hubby order the burger, it was good but nothing spactacular. Very busy on the weekend so come here for dinner.   Parking is a pain though. Tiny little parking space hard to park a truck...this is why the 1 star was taken off."}
{"text":"A go to spot on the late night. However if you able to go their before the hours of 11pm I highly suggest it.  The shrimp and grits and chicken and waffles are probably their most popular items.  They have a variety of items on their menu  I stick  to the breakfast menu when I go though. They also had turkey sausage which I was happy to see on the menu which I ordered with pancakes, eggs  and hash browns which were a little to crunchy for my liking but the rest of the meal was pretty decent."}
{"text":"1 Star because 0 wasn't an option. TRIED to eat here Sunday morning (6/14/2015) at least 10 people on the clock and no one would seat us, no one even spoke to us and they weren't busy. 3 booths were occupied. The girl behind the counter seemed more interested in filling A1 bottles and gossiping with co-workers. We stood at the front where the please wait to be seated sign was for several minutes before we decided to leave."}
{"text":"I have only been here during breakfast hours and have no complaints. I have been about 3x and always gotten the Greek omelet. Service is pretty fast. Last time I went they messed me up by putting the wrong cheese in my Greek omelet, but they quickly replaced it so it wasn't an issue.  There is limited parking on the side of the restaurant and a bigger lot in the rear. Although I have never gotten the chicken and waffles I do know that they serve REAL chicken wings with their waffles which is a plus in comparison to some other places.   I would go here more often for breakfast if it were closer to me. I have never had a problem with any staff. It's a diner so they don't exactly schmooze, they serve and keep it moving! I recommend trying his place for a quick casual meal!"}
{"text":"Will always be a fan of midnight diner . I don't get to go that much, but when I do , ordering something with grits  is absolutely necessary. Their grits are outstanding, or as one of my friends once said, \" ...made by God\". Super creamy grits y'all. Then there is the rest of the extensive menu. There's nothing more disappointing for me than going somewhere for brunch and the menu is so limited or too bougie . If the brunch is bougie it BETTER be GOOD. Being a diner, Midnight has something for every meal and is VERY casual. Other favorite menu items of mine here are the Challah French Toast and the shrimp and grits. Very few places do shrimp and grits the way I like ( sans any chunk or piece of pork in it) but I think Midnight Diner does a good job with theirs; it's a little on the spicy side, but still tasty."}
{"text":"It's a great place! Love the food love the service. The service is super fast. BUT the water tastes like napkins or tissue. It's got a weird after taste. Please fix your water. Add a filter."}
{"text":"So good! They have a mix of breakfast and burgers/normal food. They also serve beer and local beers. I got a waffle with sausage eggs and grits. I killed my waffle. My Server was also super nice and literally brought me anything I could've needed without asking!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Charlotte a few times but never ventured to this spot. Glad we decided to. Shrimp and grits are delicious. The biscuit that comes with it is perfect. I was feeling a little fat so I pancakes to go with it and some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Next time I'm in town I will def be back to this little old school diner"}
{"text":"Fast food. Very friendly service. Food was quick, fresh and hot. A must stop if you are in the NC area.   Upgrade your waffle and fried chicken to FRENCH TOAST and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours and still almost always busy! Love this spot for an alternative to Waffle House. Food is good. They serve breakfast all day as well as burgers and shakes - typical diner food! Service isn't always the best but that's okay.  If you're trying to go Sunday for brunch.. good luck haha"}
{"text":"Oh boy! When the hostess is rude as soon as I walk in the door I just turn right around. Only went because Arts BBQ was closed. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Okay, so maybe this place is located on the same lot as a cabaret and quicky motel, but don't let that fool you into thinking this place shouldn't be visited!   Perfect for a late night meal after a show at the Music Factory, Midnight Diner welcomed us with bright neon lights and a staff that was more enthusiastic than a well tipped stripper. I'm pretty sure there were more waitresses than patrons at this time of night and they were all giddy over what ever song was playing on the jukebox. Our very own Pourina R was seen dancing with waitresses at said jukebox and I got called out for singing along to some 80s pop ballad. This was the fun type of atmosphere the diner had at midnight.   I got the french toast and, OMG, the slices of bread were gigante. One and a half inch thick challah bread dipped in delicious french toast batter, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with syrup. It was so enjoyable (and filling) that I was able to revisit it again the next morning.   My dining mates all got fried chicken with mac n cheese and some other side. I recall all mac n cheese being gone by the end (or middle) of the meal, so it must've been good.   Parking lot is unpaved, bathrooms are clean, and jukebox is ready to go. I believe this is now my favorite diner in the QC."}
{"text":"Waitress got our order wrong 5 times. Brought food to the table, took it back, brought the same exact plates back out several times. Finally when we told them to cancel the order, they mysteriously found our food was ready to be brought to the table. The waitress even looked at my friends and informed them I was being \"a meany\" because I told her we had waited for food for 45 minutes and that I couldn't believe after the first mess up she couldn't get it right. Unacceptable. Then we were required to pay for our food even after the entire fiasco. Absurd."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good. Service was top-notch. The food incredible. Best grits I have ever eaten. No contest. Everything was cooked perfectly. Thank you for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I had but a simple cheese omelet, but, it definitely beat out all the others I have tried, except for mine!! Fries, (hand cut), were tasty with just enough spice to give them a slight kick! Overall, worth the trip and time!!"}
{"text":"Perfect late night spot for some drunk eats!  LOVE the decor and the retro feeling of the place.  When I went my friend and I got a booth, the juke box wasnt too loud and the service was pretty fast.  Awesome people watching, all mix of people at 3am.    I had the BLT and it was good, the prices arent outrageous.  I will definitely be back!  :-D"}
{"text":"Hot, juicy fried chicken and amazing mac and cheese! Food is always so good here, I always finish everything on my plate. I don't usually like collard greens but I theirs is good! My only complaint is that the waffles aren't crisp enough but they serve them with hot syrup so it makes it all okay :) Service is good, the servers are kind and check up on you frequently. Especially great coming here after a concert in Charlotte.   I love this place."}
{"text":"Never had my son say it was the best burger he's had. And we eat out a lot. My chicken and waffles were awesome and so was the banana pudding. The vanilla wafers didn't taste like they were from the box but tasted like mini cakes."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly wait staff , great ambiance   and plenty? of good food at this diner. We tried some specialties such as the fried chicken and home made french fries. We also ordered a fish taco, kids  mac and cheese, giant salad  with chicken tenders and sides of coleslaw , biscuits and onion rings. All nicely plated,  and good portions. Everything was tasty.  Fried chicken real good but white white a bit on the dry side, nice breading. Fish taco was great with good flavor. French fries tasty but not crunchy, onion rings ok, biscuits soft and tender, tasty coleslaw, creamy mac and cheese. The salad with chicken tenders also good and basic served with a honey mustard dressing. Chicken tenders nicely breaded and tender. Our waiter very attentive and aimed to please We will return and try breakfast here! Great menu choices  , reasonable  prices and home style food"}
{"text":"My wife told me everyone loves and talks about this place, so we decided to have a late dinner here. I had the fried fish, shrimp, and fries. It wasn't too bad, nothing to rave about. It could've used more seasoning, that's subjective. All in all, it's a good spot for a quick late night bite with the homies or a mistress."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed by this place. I got the fried chicken with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Everything was bland. With that said, the chicken was fried to crispy perfection and was succulent and oily, just the way I like it. The sides were luke warm though and just unpleasant to eat.   I guess it's a good place to go if you're watching your blood pressure. Me, I need some more salt and spices!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles and they are amazing!! There was a little wait.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place was great! We had fried chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, hash brown with pepper jack and ham. The shrimp and grits were heavenly, the chicken was crispy and yes fried to perfection. Last but certainly not least our waitress was amazing. I felt we had a personal comedian at our service, she not only kept us laughing and enjoying our night but she also recommended local bars and neighborhoods to check out while we were in town. You will have a stellar time if you get La'Tosha."}
{"text":"Still outstanding. Imagine people waiting in the rain to get in. That alone should say it all.   The coffee is just absolutely the best in Charlotte.  I finally got to try the fried half chicken with Mac n cheese and onion rings. Pure gastronomic bliss folks. I could barely move when it was over. I'm hoping we can come back for breakfast before we leave. I just love this place. They do soooooo many things well."}
{"text":"Midnight Diner was great! We usually do not go back to the same location while on vacation, we like to go to as many places as possible, but we definitely had to come back before we headed back home!   The staff was very friendly and prompt, both times our servers never let our waters or coffee mugs empty. They joked with us and seemed genuinely nice! We got Shrimp and Grits (very good if you like things with a spicy bite) and The Bubba which put all of the best breakfast items together! Their sausage gravy was VERY good!   Definitely a place we'd go to often if we lived here!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was amazing. Food was definitely on point. I had the shrimp and grits. It was absolutely delicious. The grits were creamy, shrimp was tender, and the creole sauce was perfectly spicy.  I wish the service was at the same level their food is. I honestly wanted to order a dessert however I was annoyed and exhausted trying to get our waitress' attention. Between flagging someone down to get us drinks, for a refill we (4 of us) had to put our cups to the edge of the table along with all of our dirty platters. We at that point asked for the check right away. Great food. Terrible service.  Really terrible service."}
{"text":"The food here is great and it's the perfect place for a late night meal in Charlotte, but the service isn't the best. I've been here several times and have had to wait for a server 10+ minutes after being seated (on multiple occasions). Also, I recommend paying in cash. The last time I dined here, my card info was compromised. Overall its good food for a good price."}
{"text":"I will throw up in my mouth a little every time I think of the meal they tried to serve me here. This is a polished dump for late night drunks that don't know any better. If the food quality was just a little worse they could can it and put a cat on the label. I've now eaten lunch and breakfast here and to call it food that someone else has already thrown up would be too kind."}
{"text":"I enjoy the eclectic mix of staff,patrons, and food. Excellent chicken fingers-love the burgers. Had the omelette today and my only gripe is they used Pam cooking spray. I'm allergic to the ingredients in the spray (my own fault for not asking) but aside from my own mistake the sides were good."}
{"text":"We were back again torn if i wanted breakfast or lunch because breakfast is all available all day. We opted  to try the lunch menu and once again it didn't disappoint.    My husband got a burger with bacon and fried egg on top which he said was cooked perfectly. I got fried fried fish and shrimp, the fish and shrimp were cooked to perfection- loved the coleslaw. You know its good when the line is out the door."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are FUCKING awesome!!!!! The best shrimp and grits I ever tasted. The biscuit was bussin'! The service was fast, the place was clean. Good music. The tea was bomb. I gotta a new spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went on New Year's Day for breakfast at 7:30 and at that hour there were already so many people. I had the waffle and it was good but I wish they would warm up the syrup since that makes such a  difference. The service was very good and they were all so friendly and lots of people working there on New Year's Day."}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic diner. I was really missing a diner since I moved from New York to North Carolina. I ordered the burger but it wasn't really that great.... in fact no burger is great at a diner. However my kids ordered chicken and waffles and I had a piece of them and it was great! I will be coming back here to try out the chicken as it seems to be what this diner does best! I will also return for a omelette to see how they compare to the NY diners!"}
{"text":"This is better known as the \"Turn Up Diner\". This is a great spot to visit after a night of drinks. While, I had the newest server that was slower than molasses, you can overlook that due to the quality of the food. I had the fire cracker shrimp meal. It comes with fries and coleslaw. The music was def unique from most restaurants. They featured many R&B and hip hop songs. I would recommend them fixing the ambiance and cleaning the bathrooms each hour on the hour. Overall, I had a good experience."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Arrived in Charlotte later than expected and several restaurants were closed. Did some research and found this place relatively close to the hotel.   Absolutely a great choice. We had chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and the kids had chicken strips and fries.   Went back the next day for desserts. The bourbon pecan pie was great (a little annoyed that the server felt the need to let me know how much the per slice price was, I bought three slices after he quoted me)  I wanted to ding them one star for waiting so long to acknowledge our presence, but the food was so good. I won't be so forgiving next time, so please do better ;-)"}
{"text":"First time there, was so impressed, bought the shirt.   First time there, waitress was great. The coffee was hot, fresh and delicious. The salad was crispy, fresh, and delicious. This was before our reservations elsewhere.   AFTER our New Year's Eve dining, we went BACK to the Midnight Diner for dessert. I wanted the Brownie for Two (but for one) but they were out. SO, I ordered the death by chocolate cake and IT was delicious. It was then I vowed to make a point to go back to Charlotte just to eat a regular meal at the Midnight Diner. The atmosphere is so funkified 50's and the energy is just rockin'!   PS. I could hardly believe how reasonable (to even low) their prices were. The energy was just so amazingly good vibed. I loved it."}
{"text":"Why just Midnight?  It should be named Anytime Diner.  Really great spot for grub.  I love the service here and the BLT....mmm.....bacon....:)  My girlfriend and I frequent this place often and yes most of the time it's around or after midnight.  I always have a blast with the waitstaff and they are really friendly, really quick and attentive.  In my opinion this place can be likened to a cleaned up version of a Waffle House or Denny's.  Only difference is they don't yell the order.....DARN :("}
{"text":"Awesome place eat...awesome staff...reasonable prices. My family enjoyed it especially the creamy grits"}
{"text":"Greasy and mediocre, definitely did not live up to the hype!  This place always has a wait so I figured it would be good but that was not the case. I tried their burger special and was less than impressed. This is probably only good at 2am after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Place is great. Very homey. Im here on a layover and had the chicken and waffles and the shrimp n grits. Both fabulous!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this diner last year and we fell in love, we love to have breakfast at any time of the day so this was perfect, my husband favorite is the French toast and I always try different plates and I've never been disappointed, the coffee is good too. We really like that it is open 24 hours and is very well located. We have brought a lot of our friends because we really like this place and the atmosphere. The prices are very affordable and the sizes are very generous. It's sad that their service is so poor this is the second time that I see this waitress stand in the middle of the diner screaming at the top of her lungs for people to LEAVE! We were all stunned and I really felt embarrassed. I won't be back, invite anyone else to this place or recommend it."}
{"text":"A real life diner, finally in uptown (or at least on the very edge).  Breakfast is served anytime along with a menu of mostly simple staples- burgers, sandwiches, and desserts- which are on full display at the front counter.  My wife and I went for breakfast on a Sunday recently, to see what this place was all about.  Atmosphere is mostly good: tight booths and bar seating in a long, narrow tin can of a space.  Large plasmas adorn the walls with a mix of local news and sports.  To be able to sit for breakfast without a wait on Sunday was a real treat, and I had high hopes at this point.  Service is mostly there, if not with a dash of attitude diners up north are known for.  Heaven help you if you are indecisive or ask for explanation of any menu item- our server at least acted like such a question would be heresy.    We both had breakfast and this is where things start to go downhill.  We both has eggs over medium that were more like over easy- too runny and loose for my taste.  We also ordered a few sides like mac and cheese.  These were small and not hot- like they had been made much earlier and didn't even make it under a warmer light for long enough.  The real issue, though, was with the kitchen and the other diners' entrees.  There was an air of unease amongst the other tables around us as people waited for food and then sent back orders that were under-prepared.  Servers seemed upset, themselves, but did little to put the guests at ease.  This place is new, so I get the sense the kitchen needs some seasoning working at this pace and then the staff needs to work out the timing.    All told, this likely fine for late night dining you are not likely to find elsewhere in the uptown area.  But, for a quality meal where time is not of the essence, I'd currently look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've passed this place more times than I would like to admit, always being curious but never having the time to go in.  Finally, after a morning work errand with one of my employees, I suggested I would treat her for breakfast at her choice of places.  She chose Midnight Diner because she said it was simply-the best for breakfast.  She was right.  We had our coffees and juices on the table minutes after we arrived and I ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs and was in biscuit and gravy heaven as I sampled my first bite.  I could understand why this place had a line at 2am for drunk people who wanted a greasy and all-amazing breakfast. I was enjoying it in an all-sober state at 9 am.  The portions were massive so I couldn't finish mine, but boy..... I was happy as a clam leaving there.  Best breakfast award goes to The midnight diner!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit and most likely my last. Don't get me wrong. I'm not going to begin bashing this establishment.  The first visit was okay. I had Steak & Eggs, with Grits and Toast. The grits were suggested by one of Charlotte's Finest 'CMPD', whom also informed me that the owner also owns the Topless Nightclub next door and another restaurant at the Epicenter, downtown. Immediately I could tell that the grits 'though good' were cut with either heavy cream or real butter. I was close, because it was sour cream. Final note for breakfast: Good, but I've had better. This evening and on my second and possibly my final visit, I ordered fried chicken, with two sides. It was priced at $9.99, with a substitution surcharge, for getting a leg in place of the wing, as part of the all white 1/4 chicken plate. I learned of the heavy surcharge when I went to pay. The plate costed an extra $3.22, bringing the net amount to $13.21, plus tax. I could have gotten the wing, then added the leg for possibly less the cost of $3.22.  Nonetheless, it wasn't the servers fault for how the manager on duty handled the situation. I still tipped the server $5+, for fried chicken that could have been much better, if the fryer's temperature was set at a minimum of 350 degrees. The chicken was extremely oily. The breading was good, however the meat within was bland."}
{"text":"Yet another great visit to the diner. Went last night around 4 am- place was packed.   My server didn't greet me for a few minutes, another staff member had to notify her, but upon looking around, I saw why- she was taking care of 3 full tables way at the other end of the restaurant.   Let's take a brief moment to discuss a couple of food service basics. I notice these automatically because I work in food service, but others may not. It is the management's job to ensure that each server has the correct number of tables to handle at a time, and that those tables are spaced out a reasonable distance. In my opinion, having a server wait 3 loaded tables at one end of the restaurant plus stools in the bar at the other end is a bad management decision. So when I say that my server couldn't get to me, I say this knowing that it was not her fault. The manager should have taken notice of this and reassigned her section.  Just a habit to get into when you visit a restaurant- any restaurant-  when you first sit down, take note of how many other tables your server visits, where those tables are located in relation to yours, and how those tables are spaced out. (i.e., did you all get your entrees at the same time? Then you probably all ordered them at the same time, and the kitchen had to cook them all at the same time.) Then, judge the service accordingly once you have those answers. To whoever commented that they thought they had bad service because their server was triple sat- get a job waiting tables, become triple sat, and then complain. And please, speak to a manager if you have a problem, don't just automatically deduct it from your server's tip. Sure, if you see them standing in a corner doing nothing and you need a drink refill, there might be a problem, but more than likely it's because of something I mentioned above.   Ok, end soapbox.   I got the Midnight Burger, which is a hell of a deal. Their online menu is a little outdated, it seems, but a plain burger, served with fries, is $5.75. A Midnight burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and served with fries, is also $5.75. What is your problem if you did not order this burger? I want another one right now. I didn't get it with cheese and I should have, but it was perfect the way it was. The fries were good too, and there were so many I couldn't finish them.   So, bottom line is guys, it's a diner. This is exactly what I was expecting it to be, and it's exactly what I got. If you're expecting to be blown out of your chair with 5-star quality, go find somewhere else to eat at 4 in the morning."}
{"text":"Nice clean neighborhood diner. The staff was friendly and the food was good. The server was alert and did a great job. Its affordable and seems like a nice spot with no wait. Late night-good spot or early morning- this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Yuck!! A HAIR in my shrimp and grits!!! I called and spoke to the GM Eddie South. After I told him about the hair he curtly asked me what do I want him to do about it. I told him he could apologize. So he begrudgingly did."}
{"text":"I walked in. It took 30 seconds before someone came and sat me at a booth. Then waited over 7 minutes before? I got up and walked out. There were over 5 servers just talking to each other or using their cell phone on the floor. Service was void. Can't say anything about the food. I did notice that plates being picked up had lots of food on them. Not sure if people who eat here don't like leftovers or just didn't enjoy the food the 1st time around. I probably saved $15.00 not staying."}
{"text":"Food here is great. A good waiter is hit or miss though. Overall, it's worth it. Fish dinner is awesome, so is the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This is one of our first stops every time we're in North Carolina! I've never made it past breakfast to try lunch or dinner. The Challa coconut French toast is awesome! Their grits are always on point. The staff is always upbeat, friendly and thorough. We love that they're open 24/7 too."}
{"text":"Simply an amazing diner. We were greeted by the host and taken to our table where Bonnie would be waiting on us. I ordered The Bubba which was one of the best comfort meals I've had. Overall the experience was fantastic and one of the best parts was the upbeat attitude of the whole staff. They generally seemed to be having a good time and Bonnie did an excellent job taking care of us. Definitely would recommend Midnight Diner."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but it has really gone down a lot even the rating is low it's not worth the money at all"}
{"text":"I work at the hyatt and recommend them all the time because they are close and open 24/7 ....but after my past couple of experiences....with them messing up my order I may stop sending them business....I send them guests everynight but I'm tired of having my burger messed up. Ticket and receipt and order was taken right.....but they messed up making it....no mayonnaise it'll save me trips to the bathroom on third shift here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They're open late, the service is good, the food is incredible, they have it all. I had the quarter fried chicken (white) and it was great. It doesn't look like a place that would have good fried chicken, but looks are definitely deceiving sometimes. This was easily some of the best fried chicken I've had in this city. 4-Cheese Macaroni, tasty green beans, and even the french fries are good. Parking is a bit of a hassle but other than that you can't beat this joint."}
{"text":"Holy French Toast Batman. I took a friend here Saturday for breakfast as he had never been. Silly boy didn't realize what he had been missing out on. Though the line was out both doors we were still seated within about 10 mins. I like that. Our server, like always, was great with a good personality. I ordered the French Toast and it was thick with lots of flavor. The bacon was also think and not too crispy, but just perfect. The boy got biscuit and gravy which were to die for. The biscuit was super fluffy and delish! I keep telling myself I am going to try the chicken and waffles....perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"Dinner or after Midnight eats... I have eaten here on many occasions and the food has never disappointed. Chicken and waffles and most of all the French Toast are good. The atmosphere is a little cluby after 12 and a lively diner before. Wouldn't go with more than 4 friends though and if you go after midnight be prepared to wait in line in and/or outside."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was good, bit of a wait for a table but that just tells you how good it is!  Once my cholesterol goes back down, I'll be back for the big breakfast again!!!"}
{"text":"Our table had a sampling of many things on the menu from omelets and waffles to milkshakes and pancakes.  Everyone left happy!   The wait staff were incredibly friendly and all of our food was cooked as ordered and was served very quickly .  The San Bernadino omelet was perfection."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I had high expectations going here.  This place is LOUD!  Aside from that the food is nothing special.  Just more frozen dishes prepared behind the scenes.  The quality was no better or worse than any average place out there. If you want to eat like the majority and mediocre food appeals to you, this is your place.   Don't expect the staff to be friendly as they are too busy to say much more than \"You know what you want?\".   Decent food is a lost art these days so do not think you are getting anything great here!"}
{"text":"They never noticed us for a few minutes and we sat at the Bar up close and personal the guy that sat down right before us and ordered at the same time got his to go order about 20 minutes for we realize that our food and never even been ordered and then they tried giving to someone else's food after paying a $10 taxi cab there and another $10 taxi cab fare to get back"}
{"text":"This was the first place I've been to eat lunch by myself. I work right down the street and was wandering around in search of sustenance. There is sat, a shiny, aluminum, airstream-of-a-jewel off Tryon.   The best Chicken & Waffles in town sign out front did a great job of affirming my longstanding craving for fried chicken. \"Why not do it on a Tuesday?,\" I thought.   Cut to the chase: Chicken, biscuit, baked mac'n cheese, broccoli $7 Chicken = juicy chicken wrapped in a crispy, waffle cone jacket Biscuit = ideal Mac'n cheese = ideal Broccoli = steamed, not buttery, Thank you   My big girl pants were feeling pretty tight after this date."}
{"text":"I liked the breakfast (minus the creamy grits -- next time it's hashbrowns for me) and my friend's chicken looked really good. The burger my other friend got was \"ok.\" I might return, but not for a burger. Also, the booths are a bit \"cozy.\""}
{"text":"Great breakfast at reasonable prices and super friendly service. Worth the wait in case there a line when you get there"}
{"text":"IT DOESNT GET ANY BETTER WHEN IT COMES OT LATE NIGHT DINING!!  You MUST request Doug or Maria as your waiter THEY ARE AMAZING!!  You will get the best service from them.  The food what cna I say..  It the BEST!!    I personally order the Quarter Dark chicken with Mac and Cheese, with Green beans and A Waffle.  They are famous for there fried chicken here.  There burgers are great, The chili cheese fries are to die for here.  Healthy portions and you defitnely get your moneys worth here.    The is a great place ot sober up have a fun meal with your late night friends and people watch!!  You will see people walk thru that door of ALL SHAPES AND SIZE!!  :)"}
{"text":"I just ate at this place last Saturday while looking for a good brunch spot.  The options were many and everyone in my group chose the chicken and waffles.  They were very good, especially for the price.  Not as good as Roscoe's or Gladys Knight's, but a good backup in the Charlotte area.  Will definitely come back and am really excited about the late night hours.  This will be a new spot after the club!"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing. Shrimp and Grits & The Bubba. Our server was awesome! Love, Love, Love Latosha"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the diner because it's always an interesting experience watching the other patrons. One time I was in there with friends and all the customers just broke out into a sing along to the music that was playing and it was absolutely hilarious but back to the food I enjoy the food the grits are good I love the firecracker shrimp."}
{"text":"Very excited to go to Midnight Diner for lunch today for a couple of reasons...1. ) wanted to see if this dining car had been built by my family (back in the day..Fordero Dining Car Company from New Jersey)..unfortunately it is wasn't, but it is a good looking dining car but missing the touches that I am familiar with.  2.) miss going to a New Jersey diner so wanted to see how it stacked up (can't stack up to a NJ diner experience..so put that thought out of your head)..3.) the food - and that is really what the 3 stars are for..  We got there about 12:30pm and was excited to see Hamburger Slider Combo for $5.95 - that is what my husband ordered.  My English teacher mom would be very upset that we didn't notice it said \"slider\" and not \"silderS\"..So, when the very small SINGLE slider showed up at the table my husband was not so pleased.  Not only was it a single slider it was a very thin slider..(think the waitress would have mentioned this fact since it was a male ordering the slider..she could have saved the meal by suggesting that if he was hungry he should opt for the full size burger). Slider was good but portion was not ample.  I must have lost my NJ mind at the front door because I ordered the shrimp and grits with Creole Sauce Special for $5.95. I forgot I was looking for the NJ experience because no diner in NJ has Shrimp and Grits on the menu..But I always order Shrimp and Grits if it's on the menu..that's just my thing..The grits and Creole Sauce were very good - maybe a little too soupy.  The shrimp were small, but what do you expect for $5.95.  But there were ample shrimp.  I might have felt better about the dish if there were about 5 larger prawns - but then I realize the price would have been more.  We will go back because the philly cheesesteak wrap (there are none of those in NJ diners either) and the regular size hamburgers looked good.  The free parking is a definite plus.   The menu has different items - there is something there for everyone."}
{"text":"The food is good, even better after a night of drinking. Just don't expect a whole lot from the servers. They seem to really not care about the customers. For example, we sat for 5 minutes before even being greeted. Then our food came out and I ordered the Midnight Special. I didn't have any syrup on the table for my pancakes and I was also missing hash-browns. I waited for my server for about 5 minutes. Then my boyfriend walked to the bar to ask for the items I was missing and no one even came up to him to ask if he needed anything. Finally my server came around and told us she'd get my hash browns right out and brought me syrup and hot sauce. I was then charged extra for the hashbrown until I brought it to her attention that I never received my order that was supposed to come with my plate. She took them off but she seemed irritated and like I was asking her to do to much. The star rating is solely on the food... the service we received is a -1."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is great and sometimes it's okay.  It's always fast and cooked to order, and the service is good. the only downside is that the decor really requires an overhaul, but maybe they're going for that old diner look? It's convenient to get to, ample parking. It's no 5 star restaurant, but defiantly a GOOD diner."}
{"text":"It's about what you'd expect from a 24 Hour Diner that isn't notable for anything. The Diner is located in Uptown (Downtown), where the only other business open is their neighboring bottom of the barrel Strip Club. It's got a Menu full of your average greasy diner food served by fine middle aged ladies with a slew of bad tattoos to go with their bad attitudes, who are probably going to be chewing gum to cover up their cigarette breath. These lovely ladies look like they ended their tenure at the Strip Club years ago after too many cigarettes and whiskey and way too much diner food, so they just moved on over and started waiting tables for dollar tips all the same. Go here if you enjoy that sort of ambience, sometimes I do."}
{"text":"Ok where to I begin.. If you want good down home Diner food, this is the place to be! Girls late morning breakfast/lunch and no one was disappointed! I had the fried chicken platter with onion rings and broccoli (had to laugh myself @ broccoli), but everything was great. The breakfast options looked amazing.  The server was prompt and not pushy, the music was on point and atmosphere friendly! I will def return to try breakfast."}
{"text":"It's the place to be at all hours... come in late night and enjoy the show or come during slower hours and just enjoy the diner. Great food.  Chicken n waffles always a win Shrimp n grits. Win  Banana pudding normal.  Servers ... well let's just say they should have their own menu Hahahaha ."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Midnight Diner (at 2pm lol) because the cute brunette Jennifer (Jenn on her name tag) provided us with a great experience. She made sure that me and my friends were always full on waters and coffee, and that we had a great dining experience in general. She provided us with great conversation and she never stopped smiling when she was at our table. That's what I like to see in a server: a great attitude. I liked the food too, although the pancakes could be a lot better. :( not affecting my score, though. I got a Philly cheesesteak to go and Jennifer suggested that I separated the bread from the meat to make sure that the bread wouldn't get soggy on the way home or when I put it in the fridge for my boyfriend whom works 3rd shift. What a great waitress and a great ambiance! I felt very welcomed there from the time I walked in. Thanks, MD :)"}
{"text":"Don't know where to START OR how to STOP once I've started. You'll regret it for sure if you pass this GEM up! Small price for a lot of GREAT food, that'll definitely get my attention and $$$$$$ EVERYTIME!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to any of their food items except breakfast items, because that's all I've ever had here.  But I can say, without a doubt, that they definitely do breakfast very well.  Twice now I have been to this adorable little diner; once on a weekday, once on a weekend.  The decor in here is a throwback to old diners, with checkered patterns, red and white chairs, and awesome neon lights.  They also have framed records on the wall, and much of the time play music from the 60s.    The staff is pretty friendly and helpful as well.  On my first visit here, one of the waitresses was singing and dancing along with the music.  It was awesome!  Both times, our food came pretty quickly and was nice and toasty warm.  Now, onto the food, which was tasty!  They seriously have the best grits I have ever eaten.  I had The Bubba the last time, which was biscuits and gravy, grits, sausage links, and cheddar scrambled eggs.  It was fabulous; the gravy was mildly peppery and delish, a perfect topping for the biscuits.  My partner had the chicken and waffles - the chicken was so tender and juicy, I have never had a chicken wing like that.    Maybe someday I'll venture to try their dinner items, but this is definitely my new go-to place for breakfast. The construction going on there right now makes it difficult to get in and out, with parking being a bit of a pain.  Still, it's worth it to fight through the workers to go, especially considering that the construction (hopefully) won't last forever."}
{"text":"My first visit to Midnight Diner was during Speedweek and the food was great, fast service, even in a packed house. But the second time was a dull Wednesday evening with hardly anyone around, and service was sloooow. We were a bit early for a show at the Tremont and thought we'd grab a nearby bite at Midnight. There were only 2 other parties in the house, and we ordered 2 burgers and a plate of fries--and it took 20 minutes to come out.  Seriously? Diner time is like dog years; 20 minutes equals an hour and a half! Especially for a couple of BURGERS. Speaking of which, they were nicely topped (I got the Cali burger with avocado and added a side of jalapenos), but the meat wasn't seasoned and they were a little bland. Not worth missing Das EFX's opening song."}
{"text":"This place was just what I needed.  Great selection of diner food!   I had breakfast for dinner.   The \"Bubba\" was an opened faced biscuit with scrambled eggs, sausage gravy, hasbrowns and sausage patties.  It was perfect!   My companion had the shrimp and grits and was very pleased with the flavor and quality.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good Breakfast, very crowded, and long wait. The pancakes are very bland, but everything else was pretty good"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The service could be better, but the food is so good it doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I love this place! This was my second time here once being late night like 2:30am-ish and the second on a Sunday morning for brunch!  To be honest I have no memory of the first trip so this review is for the Sunday brunch which was great. It's a small dinner with booths and a \"bar\" I guess.. not sure what to call it. We arrived semi early for brunch so there wasn't much of a wait but by the time we left there was a line out of the door. The food was really good especially the eggs and they give good portions. The wait staff was attentive and friendly ! The best part was the music playing it was such a variety and who doesn't like to hear a little Usher \"Climax\" on a Sunday morning!!   We were charged .50 to add cheese to the eggs... the waitress didn't mention this but I'm sure it was on the menu somewhere ... overall nice spot to pick up a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place - but I never go there late at night. The lines are ridiculous on the weekends! I usually venture over on Saturdays or Sundays. The San Bernadino omelet is my favorite and the biscuits are delicious. Everytime I've been I have been seated within 20 minutes as well. I live in DC now, but midnight diner will always be one of my favorite go to brunch spots."}
{"text":"My brother and I went to this diner during our first day visit in Charlotte after a long flight from Los Angeles and we finally had a good meal after a long 5 hour flight. The service was good and the food was really good. Gotta love the 1950s design!"}
{"text":"Retro little diner with great food. The server we had was very nice, but forgot a few things we asked for. It was a very busy weekend morning though."}
{"text":"Being the only place open after a concert, it was pretty packed but I Can say the wait was well worth it! Especially with Nicole as our waitress! Los atiendo muy bien con mucha atención! Will definitely be back especially to visit our Good friend Nicole la Mexicana!!"}
{"text":"Hits the spot for what you need. Came here after a night out. It's just what you'd expect cheap greasy breakfast food. Hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"Good place for good comfort food. The staff is very friendly and professional, yet fun and personable. You can't go wrong with anything chicken. They have some of the best Chicken around. Matter of fact....the chicken and waffle is a must have!"}
{"text":"This place almost always brings in a crowd. We love it, however, the service isn't always the best. I've always enjoyed my food. Love the grits! I'll order shrimp and grits or grits with scrambled eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the livermush and the shrimp and grits.  Both were great.  Solid diner food.    Less awesome was the torn up seat with the red duct tape over it, the broken AC, the pace of service, and the actually warm (not tepid) water served (we were given a full cup of ice, but the point of no ice in my water is to avoid ice...).  Also, the ketchup was very, very watery.  Our two male staff members were friendly, but some of the women seemed rude to their customers and the manager had to yell at people at least three different times while I was there to sort silverware as they ran out twice.  We were also given someone else's signed credit card receipt.  Awkward!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, typical diner menu. Incredibly busy at any time of the day. Great location, terrible staff."}
{"text":"This diner is fantastic. From the food, to the staff, to the energy it is awesome. You normally walk into a diner expecting, a diner, this is far more than that. It'll be on our regular Charlotte rotation."}
{"text":"I wouldn't want to work here as there is a high level of drunks at certain times but the food is pretty decent for a diner.    The crowd is bizarre because it can be completely empty or it can be a 45 minute wait at random times.  I order a couple things regularly...  chicken and waffles, grilled cheese, or just a regular omelet.  Everything is pretty decent and the menu is huge.  Much better than going to waffle house."}
{"text":"Back for a second time in two days. First day had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was piping hot and good. The waffle was a bit bland for my taste. I thought it was odd that the \"buttery spread\" (I learned was not real butter later) would not melt. My boyfriend had the pancakes, which I also thought were bland and also had the spread that just sat there. I guess I'm funny about real butter and expected more real, homey ingredients to go along with the nostalgic vibe. I'm also funny about being cold. It was freezing in the diner, which also likely contributed to the unmelted spread.   I would come back given the proximity to my place. The best item I've tried this far is the chicken."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE! I definitely had doubts because its one of those places thats open 24/7 and a lotttt of people come here after a looong night out which is what I did the first time I went to Midnight Diner and it was delicious! But then the other day I got take out for Sunday morning breakfast and it was just as good! So sober or after a night of drinking, midnight diner is a must!   Both times I got a grilled cheese with cheddar cheese and french fries, yummy! And a really large portion for only 6 dollars! My boyfriend got chicken and waffles the first time which was great also. And the second time he got the midnight breakfast special i think it was called. 10 dollars for eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, and cheesy grits! Sooo much food, good food, for really cheap! We also got a side of macaroni and cheese which is probably in the top 3 mac and cheeses I have had since I moved to Charlotte!   Just know, that if you plan to dine in, you are definitely going to wait whether its late night or breakfast time, there is always a line at the door. Trust me, the wait is worth it! I cant wait to go back and get another grilled cheese and try some new items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Passing through Charlotte on my way from the airport, looking for breakfast, I found this diner. The service was good, the waitress was very friendly, and more importantly the food was on point, real comfort food. If you're looking for a friendly no-frills diner, this is your place."}
{"text":"My first time here. I had the French toast and my hubby had the Midnight Special. This good was great! Most diners serve decent good, but this place surpassed my expectations. If you are in town visiting, come here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the diner. For breakfast we sat at the counter. It's amazing to watch all the action going on. Nikki was our waitress. She was attentive and friendly. Breakfast was good. We got a NY Cheesecake slice to go. Couldn't wait to try it at home. It was AH-mazing. They are on my list to go back to try the fried chicken that others rave about."}
{"text":"Great little diner. We grabbed a quick breakfast here after we landed. The service was great and the food was very good."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want and expect from a traditional diner.  Solid breakfast food- coconut French toast is awesome.  Can be really really busy at times but is often your only decent late night option."}
{"text":"It's a diner & you never really know what the vibe is going to be until you are inside.  I will say that the service is usually good and I LOVE THEIR FRENCH TOAST!!!!  I don't know what the other reviewers said about the music, but it is pretty hard-core and too loud for the space.  It's a diner not a club, so I didn't like that aspect of it.  The diner hasn't been there too long, but I can see it going downhill fast if they don't take themselves seriously enough."}
{"text":"\"Carolina\" Burger?  Well, sort of.  A real Carolina style burger or dog has plain old yellow mustard on it, guys.  And the chili, slaw and onions need to be on the same side of the meat pattie so the flavors of those condiments can meld together.   These two adjustments will significantly improve your \"Carolina\" burger!     Having said that, this is a good spot for a quick lunch, so it gets 4 stars overall.  It is clean and friendly with a varied menu."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  Best grits I have ever eaten! Thank you for welcoming us twice in less than 24 hours"}
{"text":"Wow, Midnight Diner totally rocks. I wish they would open a location in Orlando!  II was here for business, so my co-workers and I got huge, delicious plates of food--along with the best bloody marys I've ever tasted--and loved every bite and sip.  The staff was so over-the-top friendly, super \"southern hospitality\" and just made it a fantastic experience. Great service, food, and a knockout bloody mary!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chili burger and it was pretty gross. Canned chili and the fries were bleh. However, the French toast was AMAZING!!! It was made from hullah bread and I could have it every morning... I would get big as hell but who care it's that good!! I give the French toast 4 stars the burger can go to hell."}
{"text":"If I wasn't starving I would have got up and left. Rhea the shift manager just stood at the bar. 5 coworkers walking about nobody ever acknowledged me or ask did I need help thank god for Kindra for the greeting when I entered the diner because that's the only greeting I got. Midnight Diner use to be one of my favorite places to come and eat but the service has really gone out the window....."}
{"text":"Great food with quick service even during the morning rush. Menu has that great diner variety! A must top in Queen City!!"}
{"text":"DAMMIT. I want to like this place. Seriously, Midnight Diner, I want to like you. I want you to be my place where I go when I need to get a quick lunch, or a greasy breakfast to bring back to the office when I have a hangover. Why can't you be that diner? WHY?   I'm updating my review. Unfortunately, I can't add any more stars to it because, well, it was really a two star experience. I had previously only had lunch at this place, and if you've noticed my other review, obviously wasn't impressed. Everyone kept telling me that for a good experience, I needed to get their breakfast food. I didn't really know when that opportunity was going to happen, since I'm not a huge breakfast food fan, and I only work near here, not live near here. Then - BOOM. Heavy night of happy hour Thirsty Thursday-style, and this morning I was feeling the need for greasy breakfast. My head was saying, \"Diner, this is your chance.\"   I ordered to go: biscuit with sausage gravy, an egg over easy, side of bacon, hash browns. Picked up my order with good timing, and as always, the staff was friendly, attentive, and awesome. Never have any complaints on my end about that. I like the people, which makes this even worse.  The worst part was the bacon. This sentence carries a lot of weight, because usually in my life I'm more prone to saying, \"The best part was the bacon,\" and I'm talking in reference to anything. I have never not finished bacon until this moment. You could tell that underneath the overcooked, dried, burntish bits that it was good, thick, applewood smoked bacon that would have been INCREDIBLE if it had just been cooked right! I had to stop eating it not because of the taste, but because my jaw hurt from trying to chew it.   Eggs had no salt on them. I asked for over easy, but there was that transparent rawness to them that suggested more sunny side up. The hash browns were also flavorless. No seasoning/salt/pepper/nothing. Also, kind of soggy instead of crispy. I put some of the sausage gravy on them to make them a little more appealing.   Saving grace: biscuit and sausage gravy. I uh, didn't actually get around to eating them yet, but from the looks of it that scratch-made biscuit is going to be tasty, and from what I tasted of the sausage gravy, it's the best I've tried yet. Then again, this is my first restaurant sausage gravy.   I'll iterate from before: I hope that if I have to go to this place again, I'll be able to return with a more positive review. Still waiting for that good food experience."}
{"text":"We went on a week day, late afternoon. There were other folk scattered about but it wasn't halfway full. Service was pretty good.  Some things I didn't like: I ordered hot tea. My cup came without a saucer and no spoon. I wasn't asked if I wanted lemon. Also, the cup was pretty thick which made it hard to sip from.   I agree with the previous reviewer about the music. I heard cursing in at least one song and there was a family that had young children with them.  The chicken and waffles were pretty good. We'll probably go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late night with some friends.  We all had breakfast and there were no complaints.  The food is a tad bit pricey for what you get.  We all had huge plates with a little food in the middle :).    Our waitress was very friendly and they offer alcohol.  I'm sure I'll end up here again at some point but I honestly prefer the Waffle House over the diner for breakfast food."}
{"text":"After an impromptu mid-week visit to Ikea with my bosses, we stopped here because it was recommended by my boss's sister. It was late night and most things were starting to close. I'm glad we went here! This is definitely a true diner. The greasy smell is overwhelming, as it should be. Ladies, just to warn you, don't come here right after getting your hair done, because it took me two washes to get the smell out of my hair. Aside from that, the portions are huge!! My bosses had overflowing plates and could hardly finish it all. Me on the other hand? Well, I would recommend you don't bother with the chicken tender meals. I ordered the biggest size they had and was pretty disappointed. The reason for this is because the tenders are really, really, really tiny. I'm serious. They were about half the size of a typical one from Zaxby's. I had probably twice as many French fries as I did chicken tenders. They didn't taste bad or anything though. My waitress also forgot to bring me the dipping sauce that was supposed to go with them. They are a little bland. Try to order something else. The French toasts and biscuits are massive. The syrup is really good. With such an expansive menu, it's almost a disservice to order something as plain as their chicken tenders and fries."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and there is good reason why. The food is delicious. The shrimp and grits are my favorite. Those grits are amazing, if I don't order the shrimp grits, I get the chicken and waffles and order a side of grits. I don't leave out of here without getting some grits! LOL You will regret it if you do. Anyway, the menu can be overwhelming but they literally have everything you can think of to eat. Plus a small bar. Diner food and alcohol. WHY NOT?"}
{"text":"Favorite place love their famous shrimp and grits Nice and creamy with the right amount of spice.  Bang bang shrimp was also good."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Midnight Diner! I first went in July 2016! I heard it was diner food so, I wasn't expecting too much. And I think that's what makes it great, you get more than you bargain for! First let me say 'Order the grits' always! They have flavor and are so creamy. The first time I got the waffle it was good, but, tonight I got the French toast and it was great! the food is amazing! The atmosphere is regular diner atmosphere. So it's fast pace. Great for early mornings or late nights!"}
{"text":"Horrible!  Don't waste your time or your money on this awful place.  Terrible service, dirty surfaces, food is one step above a frozen dinner...  just terrible.  We ordered what we thought would be the easist menu items, burgers & fries and breakfast = both choices were yucky.  We've been twice, thinking that we should give it a fair shake, but were highly disappointed on both occasions by the dingy, forgetful wait staff and the food that left A LOT to be desired.   We eat out every meal, every day but we will not be back to the Midnight Diner."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite late night spot. The crowd is eclectic, electric, and eawsome (forced that last one). I think their fried chicken is the best in town. Better than Price's. Freal. I know controversial, what will Lenny Kravitz think?  Sadly the waffles kind of suck but hey no one is perfect.  Cool story bro, get ready: I was wolfing down a club sandwich (that was pretty good) and Jared Leto say me and my fervor and said \"I'll have what he's having\". It feels pretty good to be Jared Leto's food muse."}
{"text":"So on a whim I went to Midnight Diner again since a friend was in town for the Holidays and we needed a bit of catching up. It was 10pm I was starving and am also dog-sitting so I didnt want to venture too far from home- off to the diner we went.  Our service was great- both friendly and prompt.   I ordered the Shrimp Platter $11.99 - a little pricey in my opinion but it came with fries, shrimp, and slaw.  Wow the shrimp was awesome- 5 stars for those! They were much bigger than I expected (sometimes you get the tiny ones at diners) and they were cooked just right.  The coleslaw was very fresh and homemade. They did not appear to use a mix so I really enjoyed that as well.   The fries were nothing amazing- but they weren't bad. They were standard- served hot- they are not super salty which is good and they had malt vinegar to put on them : ). They didnt give you a ton but they were heavy on the shrimp portion so I couldn't complain.   Overall I was really impressed - 4 1/2.  I think the price is the only reason for a non 5 star rating being that a diner is usually a bit cheaper but overall I would absolutely get them again!   They seem to be getting their act together in terms of actual quality of food- and that it something I can certainly appreciate."}
{"text":"This place is super affordable with most dishes under ~$10. The food was ok, nothing spectacular and nothing terrible. The service was a little slow when we were there, but our waitress was very nice and helpful. Overall, it's a good place to go at anytime of the day (literally, open 24/7) if you're looking for classic American dishes."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and service and food have declined. Brought a visitor from Michigan arrived and waited over 40 mins for food. Three tables by us received their food and almost finished and still didn't receive any food. Waiter advised food ticket was lost. Once food received asked for manager who basically said waiter lied and ticket was lost so only gave a $4 discount for our whole party. Waiters and other staff came over and advised that manager lied and ticket was lost. Service aside what manager puts blame on everyone else!!!! Will not be going back unless management changes. We could all tell our food was sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is their grits they are very creamy and always served w/o lumps so you know they are freshly made. I loved the grits so much that I ordered a second order. However, I was highly disappointed in the quality of the bacon they served here which was very hard and slightly burnt. Service was ok... but waitress was really annoying sharing way too much personal information. Won't visit this place often but when I do visit grits are going to be my go to item."}
{"text":"Standard diner breakfast food. Had the western omelet with hashbrowns and rye toast, and boyfriend had something called the Bubba, which was just a bunch of stuff smothered in sausage gravy. If you're into stuff like that he said it was good. I like both my hashbrowns and toast a little more done than they came out. Overall, large portion sizes, low prices and quick service. Plus there is just something about the diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the firecracker grilled chicken sandwich and their homemade cut fries. The sandwich was bland and the bun was cheap and tasteless. A co-worker told me that they had the best fries ever. Definitely not. They were greasy and soggy. Some of the worst fries I've wasted calories on. My visit was during lunch. I doubt I'll return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the shrimp and grits. I've had it in the restaurant and to go. It's delicious ! It has some sort of zest to it and I love it ! If it wasn't cheesy and me being lactose, I'd go at least twice a week ! Worth trying for sure !"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the coolest looking places around. Mattie's is close, but the size of the Midnight Diner eclipses it. Literally. The place is huge. Unfortunately, I think they spent way too much time on the outside of the building, making it all shiny and nice, and ran out of steam everywhere else.  For instance, parking kinda sucks. There is this smallish parking lot that can get full really fast, so finding a place to park is not easy. It can be done, but since it's not the greatest area, it can be a challenge. If you compare it to the expansive lots at Mattie's - a natural process - Mattie's wins this round.  Once you finally make your way inside, the problem is with the service. You are typically seated quickly, and promptly forgotten about. It takes forever to get anything. If you do get someone to come by, they are nice enough, but your glasses go empty and the food takes forever to come out. Once it does, it just isn't that great.  Really not worth it."}
{"text":"First time there today with family. All positive from friendly greeting at door, good service and very quick! The food and portions did not disappoint. ..will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Good and service have gone to crap!!!  So disappointed. Used to be our fav breakfast place. I guess if you're drunk or hung over it works."}
{"text":"Although the food is good, I have to give them a BIG THUMBS DOWN!!  The reason for this is twofold......first of all, when you walk into the Restaurant, the first thing you see is a list of RULES!!  Really......the list includes such things as \"No Substitutions\" (You can't even get all white meat or all dark meat when you order Fried Chicken).  So if you want something on the Menu, you are forced to order it \"as is\" and then order something else, if you wanted to substitute.  The Rules also state that you can't order a \"Take Out Meal\", then decide that you want to eat it there, or in a case I actually saw, a lady ordered take out, but when she wanted to sit down and eat her food while she waited on her ride to pick her up, she was told she had to go outside to eat!!  By the way, did I mention it was extremely humid and in excess of 95 degrees?  This restaurant is not friendly to African-American patrons!!!  The list goes on.....there must be 8 or 10 items on the \"Rules List\"!  I have been in Restaurants all over the world, Five Star, Diners and Dives, and I have NEVER seen RULES posted all over the place the way this place has them!  I feel like I am in High School eating in the Cafeteria again!  I loved the food, but I don't think I will ever go back because of this.   Also, two of the Waitresses got into some sort of disagreement while I was there and it had to do with something outside and the parking lot.  But it got so bad, that someone called the police and this was late morning, so alcohol was not involved.  Also, Wi-Fi only worked on one side of the Restaurant, and according to a Waiter, its been that way for several months. What a shame.......this is just a poorly run Restaurant which happens to have a good cook/chef."}
{"text":"I had the coconut toast and it was excellent! Waitress was really nice as well! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yummy 24 hour a day. Always great service.  This is my go restaurant in Charlotte, NC. There are no bad menu items and nothing to avoid.  Warning because the food is delicious, plentiful, and the service is great - this diner is always jumping. People flow in and out so the wait is usually less than you expect and the time you wait is always worth the delay. I have had every meal breakfasr, lunch, dinner and after the club meal here. All wonderful, always great service.  I love the retro look it is so comfy and cozy. This diner even has a jukebox you can deposit your coins into to play your favorite tunes.  During my last visit, I enjoyed breakfast pancakes, bacon, eggs and coffee. My pancakes had pumpkin added (real pumpkin not the flavoring) and they were huge and amazing culinary treats. Did I mention that they have toasted coconut french bread toast? Great. Splendiforous! The staff never changes and that us because the owner is so sweet and engaging. Everyone checks on you not just your waiter. You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Greeeeeeeeat spot.  Are here three times in one week while in Charlotte for a convention.  Friendly service.  Tammy made me feel like a BFF wanting the best for my experience.  Fried chicken was the best I had in the city!  Hated that the line was out the door on my attempt to go back on my last night...but I understand.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"This diner has great ambiance and amazing food! You absolutely must try the homemade chicken soup, it is delicious!!! Their biscuits and breakfast selections are also on point!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the midnight diner after a late night! Our server was Aneasha (sorry if I messed up the spelling!) but she was awesome and made sure we stayed hydrated. The food was okay, we all order breakfast and made the best of it. I would also say a little overpriced also for the juices and a waffle."}
{"text":"I live just a few blocks away from Midnight Diner, so despite the reviews I read, I still had to check it out for myself. I don't know if the service and food have just really improved in the past two week, but my experience was pretty much the exact opposite of most of the reviews that I read.  We were seated immediately, even though the place was busy at 8:00 p.m. The wait staff were nice, and got us a soft drink in lightening speed while we perused the menu.  I ordered the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and green beans for sides. The country fried steak was awesome - exactly what I was hoping for. It was hand-breaded with a nice cream gravy. You could tell the mashed potatoes were handmade, and the green beans were just seasoned amazingly (I probably could have just had a giant bowl fo the green beans and been happy). My fiance got hand-breaded chicken tenders with mac and cheese, and had no complaints either.   The food came out within 10 minutes of ordering - and exactly like we ordered it. I couldn't have expected any quicker, especially since the place was pretty busy.  I really have no complaints about this place, and will be back regularly. The people that I've talked to about this place also love it - one guy I know has been there 12 times already. The only negativity that I've seen/heard has been online, and not just on this website either. But I had to give my two cents after an experience that I couldn't expect to have been any better. Quick service, good homemade food, friendly staff, and good prices - that pretty much sums it up for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night bite while in Charlotte with friends.  There was about a 20 min wait for table but luckily the folks in line with us were loads of fun.  The restaurant is a typical diner atmosphere with booths, neon lights, a belly up counter and...wait for it A JUKEBOX !   I had the chicken and waffles which came with fried wings & warm syrup.  This is a solid dish but honestly I have had better fried chicken (see Metro Diner).    The Shrimp & Grits were a delightful surprise.  Full of flavor and the grits were super creamy. Yummy !  They do have a full bar which was dope.  Unfortunately they were out of vanilla ice cream so I could not have a Kahlua milkshake...#Goals"}
{"text":"Cool decor and friendly staff. I got the Midnight Special which consisted of 2 eggs any style, choice of a meat, and 2 pancakes. I got my eggs scrambled which were nice and fluffy, sausage patties were a bit overdone, and the pancakes were perfect. It took a while to get our checks and we were only checked on once by our waitress but they were swamped. Overall, would come again."}
{"text":"Let's just say I waited a few months to let Midnight Diner work out the supposed kinks I've been reading about, because I had a pretty tasty dining experience here! If I could give half stars, Midnight would earn a 3.5 overall.   The place: 24/7 diner that's quite snazzy looking. It's a really modern take on a vintage diner, if that makes any sense at all.   The scene: 8:30 am breakfast with a buddy on a chilly Thursday morning  The staff: Really, really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Lisa, our server, was really laid back and offered some great menu suggestions - even noting that certain items were best for a hangover. That's important knowledge, folks.   The food: I went with a veggie egg white omelet, side of wheat toast and they let me sub fruit for grits. My buddy and I also shared a side of turkey sausage, too. My omelet was of average size (not behemoth) and stuffed with veggies and melty cheese...just what I was looking for. The toast was, er, toast! The fruit was fine but I'm not sure how fresh it really was...almost tasted like it had been refrigerated for some time. No worries though. The turkey sausage patties were flavorful and a nice accompaniment to my eggies.   The price: A touch more expensive than I expected, but then again each order comes with quite a bit of food. I believe my omelet was in the $7-$8 range but it comes with a side of grits or hashbrowns and toast. Carby carby! I will note that the turkey sausage was $2 for two small patties...a wee bit pricey but tasty nonetheless.   So, overall the food was good - a solid choice for a low key meal. I'm sure I'll be back to Midnight Diner as it's really, really close to my house and one of the few spots open all hours of the week. However, I do enjoy another local diner quite a bit more due to the freshness and overall vibe of that place."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night, hangover cure- Midnight Diner covers it all.   The menu is huge. This is one of those places where if you can't find something you like here, well the problem is probably you. Their fried chicken is delicious (heads up: it does take a little longer, worth the wait). Marinated overnight, hand breaded- get it over a Belgium waffle or French Toast. Shrimp and grits (their most popular dish) is also really good. Burgers, BLT (huge), wings- you can't really go wrong with anything.   The place is not huge, so there's often a wait during peak times. They do have a full bar with beer (including local selections) and liquor. Music is always really great. I found myself dancing in my booth today while chowing down on a grilled cheese and green beans.  They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Warning: if you go here late night, just be careful. There have been a few incidents of crime, violence outside of the diner."}
{"text":"Wow!! I am in love with my husband's eagle eye (and much else) and thank him for spotting this classic diner on our way to elsewhere for lunch. Midnight Diner is amaaaazing. Shrimp and grits superb. Huge burgers! And Nikki's service exceptional! We'll be back.....Grazie mille."}
{"text":"Whenever I start to crave NJ diner food I find myself at the closet thing here in Charlotte,  Midnight Diner!   The chicken and waffles are my go to meal. The loaded fries are awesome after a night of drinking and the shrimp and grits are delicious. Honestly it's just good diner food!   Outside of the food the staff is friendly and makes you feel at home offering their recommendations of food and good ole southern hospitality.   If you ever find yourself hungry at an ungodly hour skip the fast food and head over to Midnight Diner."}
{"text":"BEST GRITS IN CHARLOTTE!!  The atmosphere is 60s diner Americana. You will never go home hungry. If you are wanting a hearty breakfast, then you should order the Bubba or chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I love the Midnight Diner. It is the perfect place to go for a quick bite to eat. The shrimp and grits, chicken wings and Midnight Special are my personal favorites. The wait time is never a long unless it's after the club hours (1am or later) on the weekends. The staff is always nice and the prices are very affordable. You can never go wrong here."}
{"text":"Clean, no spotless!  Delicious!! Fantastic service.  Priced reasonably.  Comfortable and nostalgic.  We'll be back.  Thanks for a wonderful comfortable dining experience. I had the burger and fries and my husband had the firecracker shrimp salad and we topped it off with sharing a delicious brownie dessert.   No line at 5:00 pm Saturday but I can see that almost any other time there would be a wait.  Definately a fun place to stop in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Visiting North Carolina and I decided to try Midnight Diner. So I went in as I pulled up  the line was out the door so I thought if the lines out the door the food must be great so I took the time and waited in line to be seated, finally when I was seated I got the menu from Amber who was the waitress and place my order, I ordered Cornedbeef Hash ,poached eggs and and toast.  While waiting for our food i always familiarize myself with the waitress so we can have great communication.  So after Amber dropped our drinks on the floor and had to replace them , But as i for my food i received my eggs in a bowl with water still in it and toast cold and no butter .smh Unbelievable I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE . i called to speak to manager never got one and i wish i could contact the owner.  They went to far ro say if i didnt have another form of payment since my chip didnt work they would have to get the officer outside , when i already informed them my chip was malfunctioning due to constant use and it happens to tons of people especially a person like me who travels. If i didnt have another family/ friend who had cash i wonder how far it would of went because i actually went in initially by myself and she played as if she was getting the officer absolutely horrible experience, to ad insult to it employees took smoke after order was taken and seem to be a norm . Not a good representation at all. I wish i could give a negative but i trust my review to handle that ."}
{"text":"Great Diner Food...24/7.....Slack Service!  Been going here for a few years now.  Up until this  year... I would have given it 5 stars.  I love the food but have to say that they really need to tighten up the slack in the service.  They used to have a solid wait staff that had great energy and worked really well together.   They were entertaining and on the ball!   Now it seems like they have twice as many employees and the service is much less efficient.  Everyone moves at a glacial pace.  When you pull in, you can almost count on the majority of the wait staff being in the back parking lot on smoke break.    The visit before last, we got there at shift change.  NEVER GO AT SHIFT CHANGE!!!!  They happened to get slammed and everyone got confused and in the weeds.  After 15 minutes, I had to flag someone down just to see if we were going to have a server.   After our order was put in and the food was delivered.... Our server never came back to fill a drink....and we had to flag her down to pay the tab.    I've watched food being auctioned off to the wrong tables, drinks spilled, dinner plates dropped etc.  It gets quite comical actually. No one seems to know what's going on there anymore.  This past visit, there was a table that sat right beside us and it took 10 minutes for them to even be acknowledged.  One waitress asked the other waitress \"Do you want them?\" (Right in front of the customer)... They both rolled their eyes and walked off.  Eventually another server stopped to help them.    I think management needs to take a serious look at how things are being run and even possibly reclaim some of qualities that their former wait staff used to have.  All in all, I'll keep going because I like the food.... But I may really have to think hard about going because of what I know is in store for the service.   Perhaps they should can the smoke breaks."}
{"text":"Went here for an office lunch last week  on a cold rainy day and had a pretty good time. Our server was very nice and attentive. I tried an omelet with spinach, fruit and a biscuit. I was afraid of what kind of fruit I would get since I was ordering \"fresh fruit\" at a diner, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very fresh chunks of pineapples, pears, and grapes! My omelet was very good. I also had a side of the mac and cheese but it was not what I was looking for. It was a little heavy for my taste. Others at the table had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, pancakes, and one tried a burger. Everybody seemed very satisfied with their food. I would be interested to try this place again. The music took me back several years but it was fun to reminisce!"}
{"text":"Love that this place is open 24hrs! It's excellent cheap food and good service. The place is tight with poor parking and it always bustling but it's worth it. Their tea is awesome as well as they're fried chicken, hot dogs & sides. I've been here multiple time and have never been disappointed with either the food or the service. I will for sure keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"The Midnight Diner is a decent place to go for traditional diner food.  I ordered the eggwhite veggie omelette.  While they gave me cheddar cheese instead of the Swiss that I asked for, I still ate it up.  Hashbrowns a bit on the soggy side, and toast is toast.  My companions each enjoyed fresh fried chicken with macaroni and cheese.  They raved about this, and took their leftover mac to-go.  I did not leave disappointed or hungry, but not sure that I'd return unless it were in fact, midnight (or later for that matter)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Basted eggs were perfect. Toast pre buttered. Perfect. Hash browns plentiful and perfect. Coffee was diner coffee as expected. Overall the best in town. Service? Just right. And fast. Licking your plate should be allowed."}
{"text":"The food was good...I ordered the coconut french toast along with their chicken wings the wings could have used a little more flavor. I also has their carrot cake it was pretty tasty and a good size portion!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I ordered the shrimp and grits were excellent as usually. A littlehot at first but I got used it. They are usually very bust. The wait staff is friedly. My only complaint it the music is too laud which m@kes the staff talk louder the the customers talk. I can put up with that for good food."}
{"text":"Decent food but nothing special, decent prices.  Good place to eat late at night when youre drunk"}
{"text":"Would only go here late at night if nothing else was open.  Nothing stands out.  Service is competent  most times, not great.  Bottom line if you have eaten at the Skyland Restaurant then you know what to expect from this place."}
{"text":"Ok i thought this place was ok over all. I wanted to love this joint but at least for this first visit I just liked it. As in its ok. The California burger was so so. It's described in the menu as a third pound burger. And for $9 you would expect it's gonna be a third pounder. And it was just a normal size hamburger. Like a 1.50 McDonald's sized hamburger.   Bottom line- if it's late night and other places are closed - this is a perfectly good place to eat. If it's 7pm, go to Hardys."}
{"text":"The BESTII kept raving about this place so now that I'm in Charlotte I'm trying it out...all I can say is that this place is AWESOME and I'm so glad she brought me here.  Everyone talks about chicken and waffles but I had the french toast with chicken and it is the best combination EVA, although I do love chicken and waffles...this is my new favorite combo.  The place has a great vibe and the people are super friendly!  If you eva in Charlotte stop by and try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I couldn't even tell you what was best. The absolutely incredible menu, the tasty and very fresh food, or the amazing staff you want to bring home and make your best friends or neighbors. We went twice in 24 hours. No trip to Charlotte should miss a trip to Midnight Diner, and since they are open 24/7, you can fit them in for any meal."}
{"text":"Nice place with friendly staffs and very delicious food this is a great place to take your family."}
{"text":"Simple but delicious! There is a reason why this diner is alway busy. The food is good and very affordable. Due to it popularity, there is usually a wait when I deem to go, but it is never regretted. Friendly service,  but can be slow at times. I enjoy their breakfast dishes. The grits are the best in town, and the French Toast is thick cut and sweet. I have never had a bad meal.  Great to go with friends and family, or just to people watch at the wee hours of the morning. Not good for a quick bite. During busy hours there will be a wait for seating, your server, food and your check. I still think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This little diner has a special place in my heart. The staff is always so welcoming and friendly and the breakfast here always hits the spot. I walk past this diner every morning when I head to work and the wonderful smell of waffles make the morning walks in the cold a little less harsh.   And in case I forgot to mention, the breakfast is amazing!!"}
{"text":"OK, I understand this will likely start a chicken Fatwa in the Queen City; but, I STRONGLY believe the MidNight Diner Fried Chicken FAR SURPASSES Price's.  Don't get me wrong, until recently I too was a Price's true believer. . .Midnight is better  It's clearly brined, given a gentle salt H2O soak (and possibly buttermilk) and hand tossed.  The oil is peanut.  It's fresh and not over-used.  The crust is lightly peppery, the mashed potatoes are homemade with JUST the right amount of pleasing potato chunks and you have a choice of classic southern white gravy or brown love.    Again, dig Price's for a quick in-and-out greasy adventure.  Nirvana is achieved at Midnight.  Couple lunch with a hand made strawberry shake.  AHHHH.    My apologies to many in the Charlotte Metro Region.  Don't believe me, go there now.  Oh, that's another plus, to wit:  MidNight is open 24/7, 355 days a year.  (Closed Christmas.)  No, I'm not an owner, a friend of an owner or stockholder.  Just DIG their chicken."}
{"text":"You only get one chance to make a first impression. The Midnight Diner aced it, knocked it out of the park, dropped the mike, & crushed it. I went to this location on ACC weekend 12/2/17. Parking was non-existent. I could have chosen to leave but I actually double parked and waited for someone to leave. Success! I was seated immediately once I entered. I came in with brunch in mind, but when I heard the table next to me ordering \"collard greens\" I quickly shifted plans. I ordered the 1/4 White Chicken Dinner with 2 sides and a biscuit. (Macaroni & Cheese, and collards). While passing the desert case I saw 1 single piece of Chocolate-Chocolate Cahke and ordered it to go on the spot. The food is EXCELLENT. if you're not careful you just might accidentally bite your fingers. I'll definitely return and can't wait to sample breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST shrimp and grits that I've had in my ENTIRE life!! I know, it sounds a bit extra, but trust me on this! I've heard a number of people tell me how good they are but questioned whether or not any of their dishes could be better than the signature chicken and waffles. We came in around 8:30p and were seated immediately. Our waiter was Leon and he was very friendly and attentive. Our food came out in a timely manner and was cooked to perfection. Of course I ordered the shrimp and grits, but my husband order fried fish and a side of grits. Everything tasted AMAZING!! I was more than pleased with our entire experience and would definitely recommend it! The bathrooms were clean and well kept as well. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I arrived in Charlotte around 9:30pm on a Wednesday night. I was starving and looking for a place open late around South End, which seemed deserted. I checked Yelp and found that most places were going to close in 30 minutes. I definitely wasn't in \"Kansas\" (read: Los Angeles) anymore.  The only place open this late on a weekday was Midnight Diner. And it was good.   When I came in I had a feeling I was going to get a great meal. The place was loud, bright and packed with a lot of diners. They were playing music from the 50's in the background. The ambiance was great.  I got the Shrimp and Grits which came out to only $11.90 (tax included). This was served piping hot and fresh. The grits were beautifully creamy and smothered in a creamy Cajun sauce that was savory and spicy. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly.   I LOVED the biscuit. It was brushed with melted butter so it had a beautiful glaze on it already. The biscuit itself was heavenly and flaky - it tasted like they just took it out of the oven and put it on the plate.  A perfect first meal for introducing me to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for a celebratory dinner with a friend (but I've been here a million times). We sat at the bar and we were promptly greeted and had our order taken. I ordered the 1/2 French toast, an egg and the cheese grits. My friend ordered the same but with bacon instead of grits. Our waitress was warm and friendly and the other waitresses and waiters chatted us up too.   I don't know if it was all of the chatting and laughing but our food came out in a flash. Everything was hot and delicious. Now anyone can cook an egg but perfectly executed grits and French toast are hard to find.   The french toast was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside with the right balance of egg and milk and cinnamon. The grits were creamy at the cheese was already melting when they arrived which means they were hot and fresh.   The price wasn't bad for all of the food we ordered $13.77 for my half.  As always, Midnight didn't disappoint. Wish I made it here more often. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My bf went there for lunch and had chicken and waffle. Then he couldn't stop talking about it for hours. So eventually we went there at 1:30 in the morning on a Friday night. This place was packed and the atmosphere was fun with 90s & 00s music playing. We ordered half fried chicken and the coconut French toast. OMG hands down the best fried chicken and French toast I've ever had. We are thinking about going back for Saturday brunch already..."}
{"text":"Standard diner eats, it served its purpose. Staff was very friendly , I got the steak and eggs with hash browns and babe got the meat lovers omelette , I didn't take pics bc it wasn't photo worthy  , not my first choice for yummy breakfast spots in Charlotte but like I said it got the job done ."}
{"text":"Ok, there are lots of reviews and photos for Midnight Diner, so I'll keep mine straightforward.  We ventured here on a weekend morning for breakfast.  Don't be put off by the parking signs - on weekends, parking is free.   Even on a Saturday, we were seated very fast.  Service is very matter-of-fact and efficient, but not Charlotte-friendly.  We liked their coffee, since it's stronger than most diner coffee.  And our food came out very fast.  But here's where it gets really good...the food!  I had The Bubba, an open-faced sausage gravy biscuit with scrambled eggs (including cheddar, yes!), and their creamy grits.  I thought Flying Biscuit's grits were the best until I tried Midnight Diner's.  I don't know, it's a toss-up now between the two.  And the eggs and biscuit/gravy were just perfect.    My husband had their corned beef hash slam.  He gets this dish a lot, and thought Midnight Diner's was the best yet.    We have returned a few times, and my husband always gets their corned beef (still the best he's had), but I've tried other items, such as the standard eggs with bacon, biscuit, yadda yadda.  Their hash browns and grits are both phenomenal.  Once you've tried both, try just picking one of them!  I always get both.  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent food, great crew, great atmosphere, chicken and waffles in Charlotte. May they never close."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to grab a late night bite in Charlotte! I had three people with me and even though there was a line out the door we were seated in about 15 minutes. It was more than worth the wait. The service was great but, the food was even better. Try the fried chicken with Mac n cheese or the blue cheese chicken sandwich and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent recommendation. The food was amazing!! We ordered chicken ad waffles, the corn beef and hash slam, and TWO bubba platters.  In the realm of artery clogging goodness, this diner was on point.  The sausage gravy was phenomenal, as well as the hash. The waffles were a perfect melt in your mouth density.  Also notable, the juice actually comes in a huge glass and it is not over priced.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"While I used to enjoy the food and I've been a customer since they first opened I will never go here again and it's sad it was a family tradition however tonight the messed up my order gave me 50% of the food and customer service is at its worse ... Check your order to the letter as in open your burger etc even if they tell you it's all there open every container because even when they admit oh yeah you should have had another bag they won't do anything to rectify the situation ... I can no longer go to what used to be a favorite Charlotte spot... What happened to customer service ?"}
{"text":"I will tell you rarely do I ever say that I liked everything at a restaurant.  I have to say the meal I had was fantastic.  I love the ambiance just like an old 50s diner ya know.  The service was very good.  We went at like 930 at night it wasn't line out the door busy yet.  when we left it was. Now the meal oh my goodness.. PHENOMENAL ONION RINGS which I thought were the best in the city but my friend told me they werent even the best in the city. I'll do a review for that place in a minute. The fried chickens was absolutely the best fried chicken I had every had, it was crispy outside and cooked perfect inside.  The Mac and Cheese reminded me of my mom's mac and cheese awesome, broccoli was well cooked, cole slaw was out of this world and the banana pudding of my goodness,, words dont' do it any justice.  Run to this place get there quickly before the crowds barrage the front door. Great Great place"}
{"text":"As far as breakfast goes in the uptown south end of Charlotte this is definitely a good place to visit.  I am new to Charlotte and wanted to try something not a chain so we came here.  Had the French toast and wings.  Thick French toast and solid wings.  Service was fine.  Pretty solid diner."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits is so good my mouth is watering typing this. My husband and I always order it like an appetizer to share. Everything here is great. We love the burgers and the fried chicken is a must. The French toast is super thick and fluffy. Afforable, filling, delicious soul food. Go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It was my first night in Charlotte, it was late but I was hungry. I decided to Yelp a restaurant in the area and the Midnight Dinner came up at the top of the search. So I decided to give it a try.   Even though it was late the restaurant was packed to capacity by people who were dining in and people who ordered to go. The restaurant is kind of small but it was clean and I was comfortable. This must be the spot after the club on Saturday nights. There was a sign on the door that said no weapons past this point which was different for me because I had never seen that before. They also had an armed police officer inside who was very friendly with the customers.  I ordered chicken wings and my daughter ordered shrimp and grits. I had to send my chicken back because they were not cooked hard enough for me. The waitress was extremely nice. She took my plate back without an attitude. It took a while for her to bring me another plate of wings but the second time the wings were cooked just right. I nibbled on my daughter's delicious shrimp and grits until my wings returned so I was just fine. But my daughter wasn't happy because I was eating all her food..oops.   Although everything tasted delicious and I prefer eating at the restaurant, I will be calling ahead next time to order my food to go."}
{"text":"I live very close by and have for eight months. Not sure why today was my first time eating at The Diner, but it was pretty delicious. My friend and I both had The Bubba which was a beautiful combination of eggs, biscuit and gravy (I got my gravy on the side), hash browns and bacon. I enjoyed every single bite. I'm sure you're wondering \"why only three stars?\"  Well, the place was pretty empty given that we went on a Tuesday morning, they're open 24/7 so understandably they were doing some cleaning while the place was empty. One of the gentlemen was moving some booths, cleaning around the seats and whatnot and announced out loud there was vomit under one of the seats close by our table. Now, I can't say I'm surprised given that many people probably visit after a night out when they need greasy diner food, but did I want to know this at 7am while I was enjoying my breakfast... NO. Thinking about it now makes me gag a little. Plus I find it disgusting that they just now discovered it."}
{"text":"Follow-up on the challah french toast:   Visited on 10/5 (see review that date) and said I would go back for the french toast. No disappointment on that one!!!!  Oh, my: .the syrup just drained into the Mackinaw City crunch and powdered sugar covered delight composed of thick, generous pieces of lightly egg battered challah. What a delight, bite by delicious bite!!!!   Need I say more???"}
{"text":"Another amazing breakfast place in Charlotte! We had to wait for a table for a long time because we went on a Sunday morning, but it was well worth it! The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Beware!!!  If you pay with cash you may get jipped.   This was my first time coming to this diner and the server (Angel) kept my change. My total came up to $27.23.  I gave the server $40 cash. When he returns with my change he only gave me $2 change. I was in a hurry to get back to work and didn't notice the difference. I left him an additional $4  on the table and left. When I got close to work it dawned on me that the server owed me $12 in change, not $2.  I called back to the restaurant and spoke to the manager (Kia) who explained that there's no way for them to track cash payments. I really hope that it's not commonplace for their servers to swindle patrons out of money.  The manager made no attempt to make this right for me. I was only left with the possibility that I may get a call back from the General Manager.  It's only $10, but it's my $10.  It doesn't matter if the food was good or if the atmosphere was nice, they stole from me. This restaurant will never get my business again.  I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for the 1st time with some friends. Party of 4 on Saturday night and we waited about 15 minutes, which is pretty good considering how busy they were. Staff was friendly. It did take about 10 minutes for anyone to come by and take our drink orders but bro, its a diner, come on, its busy, I was stoned anyway and was busy talking with my friends, so I didn't mind. I ordered the fish dinner which wasn't impressive but was just ok. I ended up eating my wife's other half of her Philly cheese steak later that night and it was delicious! My friends got chicken wings and waffles and said they were excellent. The place is a throwback diner with lots of rock n roll memorabilia on the walls.I will definitely be coming back soon and bring friends."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite place.  I think the food is basic and the scene is overrated for sure.  However, my mom loves it here.  It's one of her favorite places, so I guess I will put up with it every once in awhile.    It's open late, they serve alcohol, play loud music...ok.  The service is hit or miss and honestly is usually crappy.  You will get rude service here before good service. Prices are ok, some menu items are decent.    Just not my top pick.  In fact, I wouldn't ever pick on my own anyway."}
{"text":"Very good food...reasonable price.....great location.....outstanding atmosphere...Excellent staff!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here roughly half a dozen times and my experiences have been consistently good.  I have had everything from eggs and grits to hamburgers and apple pie and it is all delicious.  You just can't go wrong here.  Aside from the food, I love the fact that this is a 50's throwback diner.  You would think it has been around for years but in fact it is pretty new.  Despite it being a fairly recent addition to Charlotte, this diner has character that usually comes with age and lends itself as a great haunt for all times of day and night.  A quick tip: Saturday and Sunday get very busy so either be prepared to wait or time your arrival (especially on Sunday - be mindful as to when church services get out)."}
{"text":"Best Diner in Charlotte! I always get the chicken tender appetizer or French toast. Delicious!"}
{"text":"What can i say but DAYUM!!!!! this food is off the chain. I had the Big Boy breakfast. Nice biscuits with homemade sausage gravy, a slab of country ham, and some buttermilk cheese grits. Needless to say I made a Happy Plate. If ever in the Charlotte area please stop by. Open 24/7 for the party people."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits was amazing! The Grits was nice and creamy. The shrimp was cooked just right with sauteed vegetables! Served with a light fluffy biscuit! It was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"i had been hearing about this place for a long time and finally decided to go. what a mistake! rude staff, my order was wrong and it was more of a problem to correct it. i will never, patronize this business again a waste of $45!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's an ode to a traditional 50's diner, music and all.   The food. It's diner food. No frills, nothing fancy, but good food. And the portions are large. Their sausage gravy is probably the best in the area, I always order it on the side.   Coming from the north, I did expect a \"diner\" experience, meaning you order food and it's out in an unimaginably quick time. Not the case here, but that's not a qualm, just something I didn't know of when I went here the first time.   Parking- their lot is small, but there's a big pay lot behind the diner and there are spots (free) that are labeled for the Midnight Diner.   Also, expect a wait on weekend breakfasts and late night. Late night...it gets crazy inside. Overall, it's definitely worth a stop if you're in the South End area."}
{"text":"The Bubba!!! Hand's down my favorite place to eat breakfast in the QC. Service is great fast and it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Food is good, there is always a wait.   I came here with my daughter on a Sunday morning. My three year old had to go to the bathroom, so I told my server that we were going but not done eating. When we went back to the table they had cleared all of our food. My three year old's meal was not even half way finished & my meal was about half way. When the server saw us come back she said thought we left. They politely sat us at a different table and said they would remake our meals, however I told them I didn't want them to remake mine but my daughter was still hungry so hers could be remade. Well it took an additional 30 - 40 minutes to get our new food, and when I got the check they only took off half the price of my sandwich because I had eaten half prior to them taking it. Personally, I found this to be extremely unprofessional, and not customer friendly."}
{"text":"This is my first day in NC and I'm hooked already!! Very reasonable prices, quick and friendly service, and AMAZING food!!!!!!. A friend recommended this to me when I asked where the nearest Waffle House was. She swore I wouldn't be disappointed, and boy was she right! I had the shrimp and grits which were far better than I could've imagined!! I've had shrimp and grits before but nothing like this. My son had the most tender chicken strips I've ever tasted, and everything was hot and fresh as well. Not a big fan of the macaroni but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Arrived. I had the shrimp and grits . Seasoned so good . Grits was creamy. Waitress seem a little goofy but all and all I'll come back decor needs an upgrade music to loud for my taste ."}
{"text":"This place NEVER LETS ME DOWN!! I currently live in Atlanta, GA but every single time I come home (Charlotte) I make it my business to come here for breakfast, brunch or dinner! I was recently in Charlotte this past weekend, so I met up with a friend for brunch on sunday. We were able to sit at the bar immediately so that was a plus because there was about a 20 minute wait for a booth. I got the fish and grits (My fave) with a side of hash browns, and one egg. It took maybe 15 minutes for everything to come out. The food was simply amazing, fish was seasoned and fried perfectly. The grits were PERFECT, so perfect that I did not need to add anything to them. Our waitress was a little slow with responding, but I understand she was pretty busy. All in all I HIGHLY suggest anyone in the Charlotte area try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"Listen Mid night dinner is my go to place for breakfast lunch or dinner of after the club any time I'm getting those shrimp and grits. My brother loved the chicken and waffle and my BFF ordered fried fish that I almost ate all of her food and I clearly had my own plate. I love this place it can get packed after midnight they serve alcohol at the bar but every one is really there for  the food. I mean I seriously wrote dinners and drive in about this place because the grits are so damn good I want to know the recipe. If your in Charlotte come to uptown and check them out you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time dining at the Midnight Diner and it was freakin awesome! Jane the waitress was amazing!   I ordered the steak and eggs with creamy grits...the grits was delicious. Although my steak had to be recooked the food was still great.   I dined in  on a Friday morning the place was pretty packed but my waitresses made it seem empty with how attentive she was.  Her food recommendations were spot on...I have found my new favorite eatery in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and wasn't impressed. Based solely on what my wife and I had I have a hard time believing some of the stuff on the menu.   The challah bread in my French toast seemed homemade but, the syrup absolutely was not real maple syrup. For what were supposed to be never frozen hand breaded chicken tenders on my wife's salad they did a remarkable job of looking and tasting like something frozen from Sysco.  The A/C seemed like it was being piped in from the 7th circle of hell, the waitress didn't know the menu, didn't seem concerned that my wife only ate 3 bites of her food and instead of asking if something was wrong just offered a box, etc... The decor is cool but that's about the only positive thing I can say. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with this establishment. I was so excited to try the food here. That atmosphere was pretty cool walking in as well. But things turned around very quickly. First our waitress took our order and it took an HOUR for the food to come out. I ordered steak and eggs. All of my food was lukewarm....barely. Right after we received our food, the waitress decided to come right back over to ask about the check (we literally just started eating). Then she comes over after a couple of minutes again and asks to take my friend's empty plate if he was finished....but it still had food on it. So he scraped the food onto another plate to get her out of our face. When we paid for the food, we have her exact change and she asked if we wanted change back Lol. I can't make this up. I'm sure they over charged us as well. My friend got the chicken and waffles with an extra side of 2 eggs. We were billed $6.98 for a two egg breakfast. Needless to say, I will not be revisiting this location."}
{"text":"If it looks like a diner, smells like a diner, has slippery floors and drunk people like diner...its just a diner. I will say, the chicken and waffles were delicious as was the shrimp half of the shrimp and grits. A word of advice...leave your party about an hour early to avoid the line that will run outside and down the block after the clubs close."}
{"text":"So if your use to going to Waffle Houses and like them... You will like this.  The diner is styled after the 60's or so everyone is overly friendly and the food is good. Though this is a greasy spoon. I am sure this is a really nice place to hit after your night uptown in the bars. My breakfast was just ok. SORRY.    Yea I would go back for  quick breakfast.  There is other available parking near the diner that is free just follow the signs or the folks there are kind enough to help you.   yea... This place is not dog friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and really enjoyed my meals here on every occasion.  The coconut French toast is particularly outstanding and the waitstaff is extremely friendly as well.  If you're looking for a diner in Charlotte, look no further!"}
{"text":"Jennifer was our server and she's the bomb! I ordered the Bubba and it was great. My wife ordered the chicken tenders and thought they were the best! All the time we were there. there was an out the door line. Will definately be back for more! BY thje way....the coffee was not burned!"}
{"text":"I've visited Midnight Diner 3 times since I've moved to Charlotte. Only got one picture of one of my meals.   Chicken and waffles were out of this world good. Hot wings and onion rings were CRAZY GOOD and spicy just like I like them. The shrimp and grits meal was ok the biscuit was better than the actual shrimp and grits.   Server was extremely nice and helpful on all three occasions never had a problem. Nice environment for anyone of any age. Definitely recommended to anyone in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places- but definitely be ready to eat! This is the opposite of a light meal. Midnight diner has great, southern inspired dishes and classic 50s diner atmosphere. Be ready to wait a little because this place is popular!  My favorite thing to get is the Bubba: an open faced biscuit with scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage gravy on top. It comes with your choice of meat and hash browns, grits or fruit. Wowee- definitely allow time for a nap after this meal!  The chicken and waffles are also delicious and a staple at the Midnight Diner. My take is,  if you go for the traditional breakfast staples you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Every time the line is out the door and it moves kind of slow because people don't like to get up and leave right away. It is a good late night spot and their desserts are always good. A little noisy though."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were awesome! The staff was very friendly and attentive! I will definitely be coming back during my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Holly, our waitress, recommended the Carolina Burger...it was delicious!!! The service was fast and the food was amazing. I can't wait to come back to try the chicken & waffles and visit our girl Shelly, the hostess with the mostest! She was so friendly and welcoming! I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"The Midnight Diner really attracts the late night crew (post-bar) and the brunch crew looking for diner food on the weekends. Expect a wait if coming to the diner late on a weekend night or around lunchtime on a weekend day. It is not uncommon for the line to be outside and down the block.  The diner has a small parking lot, but a lot of the patrons walk to the diner. The food is typical diner food, and it's reasonably priced. If you are looking for greasy diner food and you don't mind waiting, this is your spot! If you're looking for a more upscale breakfast meal, there are awesome brunch options nearby in Charlotte - Tupelo Honey, Toast, Leroy Fox, and the list goes on."}
{"text":"Food is the only reason I give this place a star...food was good....service on the other hand is the reason I will never return to this diner. It was my first time there and definitely my last. My server was the dark skinned black lady, tall with long braided hair....Jesus Christ if she wasn't the rudest server I've ever met...I work with pretty terrible servers but she was not afraid to just be blunt and rude and mean. She tried making us feel stupid and patronized us the entire time...we came in at 4am so maybe she was just aggravated with her job but Jesus you can't speak to people the way u did to us...will never come back"}
{"text":"I ate the Carolina burger and it was the BOMB! Great service too. Our server was Sonny. Also ordered the collard greens, those were good too."}
{"text":"Get the coconut French toast with chicken wings...out of this world good. I still crave it"}
{"text":"Yummmmy..... The shrimp and grits are on point.  The fried chicken does not disappoint! For french toast, this is the joint."}
{"text":"Late night food, amazing service and adult beverages too!  Outstanding experience!  Must try!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken was so good; tender and juicy. Definitely a good portion too. I had the Mac & cheese and fries as my sides and get this you get a buttery fluffy yummy biscuit. I went on a Saturday well after midnight so naturally it was packed. But here's a tip: call ahead and order. Full disclosure though, you may have to call 2 or 3 times to get through but oh so worth it. Once you've placed your order over the phone you're able to \"skip\" the line to go pay for your food at the register. Easy peasy. The cashier was very nice and even personally delivered my food to me once it was ready. The officer who was monitoring was nice too. It was very packed but it's good cheap food so go figure."}
{"text":"The Shrimp and grits was some of the best I have ever had. The sauce is just the right mix of creamy and spicy. Exceptional."}
{"text":"If you like the Waffle House, you'll love the Midnight Diner! I had some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Simply amazing. I had chicken and waffles. I was a little disappointed in the waffles, they were a little dense. It made it seem like it wasn't cooked all the way. The fish dinner was incredible. It was light and battered just right.   Now, this is a great place to people watch on a Friday or  Saturday night. I saw some very entertaining things. The 21st century iTunes Jukebox is great. They jammed some serious old school and new school music. It was a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana, New Orleans to be specific. I've eaten in places all over this country. I've been a fan of shrimp and grits ever since I heard it in a rap song years ago, but every time I've tried it I was disappointed. Now I can stop looking for a place to get it. Midnight diners' shrimp and grit are what I imagined SNG should taste like and more. They have the solution!"}
{"text":"Stellar service great hours and solid food. Prices are all reasonable too. Try the fried chicken and coconut French toast."}
{"text":"Great diner food!  Great atmosphere!  Friendly staff!  I've been there a couple of times and have gotten the BLT, fried chicken, and breakfast sandwiches. It's typical diner food, so be prepared to get your food a little greasy but with popping flavors. It is the best diner food that I've had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a bad meal. Everything on the menu is good. But the grits, I have never tasted grits so good in my life. I usually order Shrimp and grits (best I've ever had), but this visit I decided on chicken and French Toast and again Midnight didn't disappoint. The only improvement is the sweet tea, they have to do better. My last visit the sweet tea was brewed too long and had a bitter taste, no amount of sugar could tame. I would recommend Midnight diner to anyone."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I DO like this place. It's been said by someone that it's hard to mess up breakfast and, well, Midnight Diner prepares what I would call a decent breakfast. I think Midnight Diner is more about the cool, funky diner atmosphere and at any given hour (open 24 hours a day except for Christmas) contains all walks of life - which I love. We waited for a table for a bit and were seated in a plush red booth. I ordered an omelet and your standard breakfast fare. Again, decent. Nothing to write home about but certainly - good.  That day there were random tables of strangers arguing back and forth about the best NFL teams which was mildly interesting/annoying. Oddly enough, the Panthers were not being discussed. Anyway, I digress...   This place is an interesting and fun choice when you are in the mood to hang out in a lively diner on the fringe of Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner with nice ambience. Short wait times for great diner food. The shrimp and grits were fabulous, get it with a biscuit. The French Toast is better thank expected and thw fried chicken is golden and succulent. The servers are quirky but hospitable. Next time I'm in Charlotte,  I will visit again."}
{"text":"Breakfast and just took the \"Special \" of eggs , grits & biscuit.  They know how to PROPERLY Cook grits . .salt in cooking water.  Great service.  2 for under $12, & lots of fresh,  hot coffee.  Definitely worth a return visit"}
{"text":"Waitress was a total sweetheart. Ended up getting my food to go, will eat it at work later today... Review to be continued."}
{"text":"Foods good. Typical diner style food, at diner style expectations. The line gets really long if you're visiting at night during the weekend. I recommend trying the bubba. Really filling, really tasty, and only ten bucks. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great shrimp n grits. Nice down-home diner feel. This will bless your life. If you're in Charlotte, I suggest you stop in. Dooo iiiittt!"}
{"text":"Solid, but nothing to write home about.  I had been craving a waffle all day and was disappointed with the waffle here, as it was really nothing better than what I could make at home with a waffle iron.  Also, the menu stated that it was supposed to come with whipped butter, and it did not.  I had to use the little packets of imitation butter and it just wasn't the same.  The corned beef hash, on the other hand, was excellent.  My husband had fried chicken, which was also excellent.  Service was adequate, but again, nothing to write home about.  They seemed to have about ten servers walking around looking frantic... somehow overstaffed but at the same time not delivering good service.  It was strange.  I will be back, however.  I want to try to desserts and something other than the waffle."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fried chicken I have ever had!  So hot, crispy and fresh!  The fries were delicious.  I walked through the restaurant and was eyeing everyone elses food.  It all looked fantastic.  I can't wait to go back and try it all.  But I won't try it all, I'm always going to get the chicken.  It was that good!"}
{"text":"Yeah so I needed my fat pants for breakfast after eating at Midnight diner! I couldn't resist and ordered the Bubba, which is biscuits covered with scrambled eggs and cheese, and then covered in sausage gravy...shut the front door it was good!!!  You know it's good when you need a nap after breakfast.  The staff said their slogan should be \"Eat here for food comas!\"  I agree.  My husband ordered the chicken and waffles with no complaints.  This uptown gem is a must for breakfast even if not staying uptown overnight.  Oh and it was packed at 9am on a Sunday (most places don't get busy until 10)."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening, shortly after 9pm after leaving The Liberty because their kitchen was closed (at 9pm!).  I'm glad this place is open 24/7, but it either needs to have better food or be cheaper. I got an egg and cheese biscuit with a side of hashbrowns. This ended up being about $5. The biscuit tasted like it was previously frozen and had a hint of plastic. Eggs were pretty rubbery. Hashbrowns were pretty good. My husband got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for $4.99, assuming it came with fries as the menu seemed to indicate that all the sandwiches came with fries, but alas no. It was $5 for a pb&j with no fries. Really?  The service was ok. Our server just brought our food and never came back but fortunately another server did refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a diner and more! The food, service and aptmosphere were better than expected. Gotta love the Bubba Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Onion rings were excellent and full of flavor. The big fish sandwich was the best fish sandwich I've had in years. Prices are great as well.   The only complaints (which warrants a 3 star instead of a 4 star review) the waitress told us no substitutions (we wanted a different side which was the same in price) and the bathroom and floors were dirty."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast with the husband.  This place is chrome-shiny and  appears larger on the inside than on the outside.  Our server was abrupt, almost military-like, but she was on it with the service.  My man got the coconut French toast.  He liked the topping, but wished that it was made with thinner bread than the challah.  He also longed for real maple syrup (I have spoiled him).  I ordered the veggie omelet, hash browns and biscuit.  The biscuit was light and fluffy, and the omelet and hash browns were decent.  Hard to mess up eggs, but also difficult to make an omelet stand out.   I like the vintage styled memorabilia on the wall.  The booth where we sat featured \"I Love Lucy\" and the Rat Pack.  Motown played on the juke box, which added to the retro charm. At the end of our meal, our no nonsense server gave us a sweet, little smile.  That was nice."}
{"text":"I love this place and never have a complaint when I visit. I've both dined in and ordered to go. The staff is friendly and very helpful. There's an extensive menu but I always go with the shrimp and grits which is my personal favorite. Good portion sizes and even better pricing. There's a parking lot in the back and plenty of seating. It gets crowded on the weekend and there can be a wait."}
{"text":"great kind service and atmosphere. awesome chicken sliders and an even better strawberry milkshake. yummy meal for only $7-$8. i'm so glad its so close!"}
{"text":"I love a good diner! There are quintessential elements to a good diner that evoke that sense of nostalgia including vinyl bar stools, row of booths, open kitchen where you can see and hear food sizzling on the grill, delicious & cheap food, and bottomless cups of coffee. Add a friendly waitress that calls you Hon and you've got it all!  Diner food is  everyday comfort food and if it's done well then you're reminded of home. Well, Midnight Diner does it well! The outside of this diner is beautiful! There is Chrome Chrome and more Chrome! The inside of the diner is clean and visually stimulating with plenty of places to sit. You can sit at the counter in one of the vinyl stools or at one of the many booths.   They have a pretty extensive menu with so many good options. 9 pages of options to be exact! They even have a small selection of liquors and beer.  We ordered bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast with a side of fruit and the Shrimp and Grits. The first order was good but the star was the Shrimp and Grits. At the base of this dish are the creamiest grits that I have eaten in a long, long time! Like my Granny's! It's topped off with shrimp, pan sauteed vegetables, and a creamy homemade creole sauce.  The portion was ample and I was completely full by the time I was done. I needed a nap! This dish was delicious from the first to the last bite! Karla, our waitress, was attentive and really sweet!  The other staff were friendly and had a positive attitude despite having to work on Thanksgiving. I was a happy camper and plan on returning to this diner again!"}
{"text":"There honestly isn't much to say that already hasn't been stated. Staff was friendly and attentive. The restaurant is on the tight side inside but it was very clean.  I got shrimp and grits and they were delicious. Definitely more than worth the $9.99 price.   I will definitely be returning to try out some of the other food options."}
{"text":"Save your money, buying food here is like throwing it in the trash.  Went in to pick up some takeout, all the waitresses were arguing with each other for ten minutes before they asked me if I needed help, mind you I was standing at the front door. When they look at my order they tell me they're out of everything  pretty much, no chocolate shakes, so I got a rotten milk vanilla one,  no Mac n cheese, so I got these disgusting blob they called mashed potatoes.  The grilled cheese sandwich had cardboard for bread and the cheese was cold. The. The BLT was just as disgusting. They lost my business for sure, oh yeah, and make sure you take plenty of change for the 5-10 homeless people hanging out in the parking lot"}
{"text":"MIDNIGHT SPECIAL!! The food here is amazing no matter the time of day. And dem GRITS is uh-maze-N. If you've enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Uptown Cabaret after a night out, then you'll love this place because it's the SAME FOOD!  Fun fact."}
{"text":"I love this place. The shrimp & grits are to die for.  So creamy and delicious. The fried chicken is good also. It's the perfect place after a night out on the town or breakfast.  You can eat, drink and chill in a very casual downhome place. Good food, Good Fun, Good service."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing.  Two of us went for a late breakfast on a Saturday. Attentive, cheerful waitress who helped us order in a way that would be cheaper for us.  I've only been here once and only ordered 3 items so I can't vouch for consistency BUT I can say that everyone on the planet should try their fried chicken wings with the coconut French toast. WOWWWW. The French toast was not super sweet like you'd expect, so syrup on top of those with the wings was perfection. I'm a big roscoes chicken and waffles fan and was worried this wouldn't meet my expectations lol. It was different but just as good. Also I've never had such buttery home fries in my life. Everyone go here right now!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This diner is unbelievably great! Came in town for weekend and brought 3 kids. There was a long line outside but they move people thru so it was only a 15 minute wait.  Well worth it so stick around!  I was starving so I had the Midnight Special. It was huge and delicious.  2 kids had waffles and chicken. They loved chicken so much we ordered more chicken.  Pancakes were also ordered and fluffy.  The staff is on it and place clean and dinerlicious!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice reminder of NYC. The prices are affordable. The service was great. The food was good. It was family and date friendly. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is so worth the wait! Try the salads - they are surprisingly huge and delicious! Yes girls, there is a way to eat semi-healthy even at a diner! Make you and your man happy, amen!"}
{"text":"If Southerners know one thing, it's breakfast.  In particular, you'd be hard pressed to find better biscuits anywhere besides the Deep South.    Midnight Diner looks like a diner you'd find somewhere along a highway in the northeast, but it's in basically downtown Charlotte.  I met some friends here for breakfast and loved my breakfast of a biscuit with two perfectly fried chicken tenders and a slice of cheddar cheese as well as the hash browns.  The hash browns were ideal in their simplicity of shredded potatoes.    And like many of my other Charlotte dining experiences, the service and value for the money couldn't be beat.    One of the best 24 hour dining options out there!"}
{"text":"Nice shrimp and grits w a fluffy biscuit was a great way to start my weekend ! The music here is old school and customer service is good."}
{"text":"Uptown Charlotte's 24 hour diner,  it's a traditional one. Right down to the chrome all over the outside. Nicely placed with a large parking lot. Very close to the stadium, so expect it to be filled with fans wearing their Black, Blue and Silver on game days. Booths and a few tables inside.  Traditional diner menu with burgers and eggs and things. I did see other people with waffles and wings, but it was actually breakfast time when I was here. I chose to go with the \"Uptown\" which is two eggs and hash browns with a waffle. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were both crunchy and soft. The waffle, however, was beyond desciption. Crispy on the outside, flully inside, it was still nice and hot to melt the butter and it soaked up the hot syrup. Excellent flavor.  Service was great. My waitress refilled my coffee often and cleared plates as I emptied them.  Free wifi, though no power outlets that I could see."}
{"text":"Went in for a take out order for 3 people. Waited at the bar for it. The waitress handed me two bags and I assumed everything was in there so I didn't check. Got home and realized I was missing my order (shrimp and grits). I was not going to drive back so I called and she admitted the kitchen forgot it so she said she'd refund me the money back to my card which I thought was great. However, never received a refund so I guess she lied? And now that I try to call, phone doesn't even ring. Terrible. Basically they charged me for shrimp and grits that I never got.. I would say I got robbed."}
{"text":"Hmmm, finally went to Midnight Diner.  We had breakfast for lunch.  The service was excellent and the food even better.  A big plate of home fries, eggs, bacon, and two great big flapjacks!  I am glad I was sharing.  The ambiance is pretty nice with the colorful and there was a nice crowd in the diner at around 1:30 pm.  All of the plates I saw coming out were piled high - good to know if you're hungry.  However, as with all diners in this area, the menus are not as varied as they are in the North but this one is definitely worth a trip to receive the Northern diner feel."}
{"text":"Although the line was super long to get in, the chicken and waffles was amazing. The waffle tasted home made quality and the wings had the perfect flavor and seasoning."}
{"text":"After an early morning watching EPL at or favorite bar my girlfriend and I were looking for a late breakfast.  As we were near Uptown we though we'd give Midnight a second try, first for breakfast.  We were seated fairly quickly considering how busy things looked but it took quite a while for someone to come over to the table, perhaps 5-8 minutes.  After ordering a fairly basic breakfast it took what fellt like 15 minutes for out food to come out.  While our waitress was thoroughly apologetic for both waits she said it was because they were so busy.  I appreciate the effort but for a diner noon on a Saturday is prime time.  They might as well be short staffed at midnight on a Friday or Saturday.  Food was pretty good, but the burger I had on the previous visit brings down their average here.  Thin, dry and seemingly mostly made of filler and not hamburger.  Overall not a bad experience either time but nothing to keep me coming back either, there are better diner options in town if you're willing to make a small effort."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Midnight Diner, it's always there when you're hungry. We've gone many a morning afters, and many a late evenings. I love the firecracker shrimp salad, warm delicious shrimp tossed in firecracker sauce and put on a bed of sexy lettuce...(didn't know lettuce could be sexy did you?).  I've also had an omelette here, fries, grilled cheese, carrot cake. I haven't had anything I didn't like. My friends have tried the chicken and waffles, and even french toast and chicken (upon request), chili cheese-fries, hot dogs, and the Mexican burger YUM.  The crowd here gets interesting, so keep a look out for some good people watching moments. We love when we get a fun waiter/waitress to like Lissssssaaa, which is exactly what her name tags reads.  Try out Midnight diner for your next late nite, or after hours get together, or morning after a good time Uptown!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write negative reviews and tend to focus on praising businesses but our experience was so terrible, this place deserves this rating. I went for the first time with my husband for breakfast and service was terrible! The scum of the world works there. Not even to mention the 90% sanitation score they have that I noticed only after eating. The food was disgusting, people who rave about the \"amazing\" food here, have clearly never had \"good\" food before. The chicken wings I ordered were cold, and the french toast was flat out gross. My husband ordered a corn-beef hash that looked like dog vomit, it was not fully cooked, the eggs also came out raw. He requested to get this fixed or something in place, and the gold teeth manager in the kitchen refused to. We were extremely disappointed by the terrible customer service and food and will never be returning. What a dump of a place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   We've come here before, I had the dynamite shrimp grilled.. Was ok, not spicy at all though. We decided to stop by again today for brunch. It was packed but luckily the bar was wide open.. Who needs tables right? Our server was not as attentive as I had hoped though she was nice. Only filled out waters once. It also seemed very busy but still.   I got the midnight special with a side of rye toast while the bf got the bubba special. Food didn't take too long considering the crowd. Wow, I got a lot of food, couldn't finish it. The grits were so good! It feels like so much butter you think there was cheese in there. Not for the dieter. The chocolate chip pancakes were good, I like that they give the syrup warmed. I took stars off because I asked for poached eggs and a majority of my eggs were overcooked, almost to a full boil. Bleh.. The rye was also overly toasted and very hard. The bf's bubba special looked amazing, I couldn't take a pic, he ate it too fast lol open faced biscuit, cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage gravy, hash browns and turkey sausage. Very yummy and great bang for your buck! I'm getting this breakfast the next time I'm feeling eggs!   We also took a slice of chocolate cake home. It's very rich.. Took 3 days for us to take it down. Tip: use vanilla ice cream.. It balances the richness. Midnight is open 24/7, nice! Great drunk munchies! Breakfast, lunch and dinner, everything sounds good. Will be back, hopefully my eggs are the way I like it. Maybe for the shrimp and grits next time, imagined they are very good here."}
{"text":"I had the Philly Cheese-steak and enjoyed it with a side of cheese grits. Both were good in my opinion. The wait was long at 11, but once seated I was immediately acknowledged. The waiter we have was attentive. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Ive come here on two different occasions and I truly enjoyed my food and dining experience as a whole. I love the quaint little diner. The first time I ordered the shrimp and grits which is to die for and the second time I ordered the fish sandwich and my counterpart ordered the fried chicken. The food was good and the service was good as well. I cant wait to bring my mom and some other out of towners. This is my new go to spot."}
{"text":"Met my daughter there on a Tuesday night.  Although busy, there was free parking available, we were greeted, seated and served right away.  We did not expect a gourmet experience.  We ordered the fish platter, mac & cheese, and spaghetti.  The food was acceptable and reasonably priced.  In summary, we had a nice, relaxing experience near downtown.  We would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"I suspected the tales of epic Shrimp & Grits and life-altering Chicken & Waffles at 2am were bound to be exaggerations, but alas, the Midnight Diner is gold, Ponyboy.   My friend and I stopped in after a very long day at work upon my brother's recommendation. Even after midnight on a Sunday night (actually Monday morning) the place was packed. Boisterous diners of all shapes & sizes were busy celebrating LIFE and FOOD!   We were seated promptly and quickly greeted by possibly the BEST SERVER EVER!! Jaya (sp?) was quick, sincere, knowledgeable, and a genuine pleasure to be around. We asked about the Shrimp & Grits and Chicken & Waffles, and she confidently recommended BOTH. I ordered the S&G, my friend ordered the C&W. Jaya suggested that the waffles were good, but not that special. She then recommended the Chicken & French Toast.   In short order, our food was brought to us, and NOTHING was a disappointment. Maybe the Shrimp could have been bigger, but they gave me 8 instead of the advertised 6, so I was just fine with that.   Yes, it was awesome. The S&G was spicy enough to start a fire, but gentle enough to savor every bite, the undeniable warm, fluffy goodness of the buttermilk biscuit puts Bojangle's to absolute shame, the C&FT was so good it should be illegal and the atmosphere was thick with electric, deep-fried, southern goodness. Stop what you're doing, and go to Midnight Diner NOW!"}
{"text":"Their biscuits are always fresh but for the most part the food is just average. The location is great and they are open 24hrs. Do not try to go after bars close at 2am because the line is always wrapped around the building on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is a classic Charlotte restaurant. It's good quality, diner food. Comfort food with breakfast options any time of the day. The fried chicken, French toast and Midnight Burger are some of my favorite menu options. I don't think you can go wrong with any of those. I also recommend the mac and cheese for a side. You can also order alcohol here which is kind of cool.   The parking situation sucks, plain and simple. Not enough spots and the only other option is to pay in the lot behind the diner...$7 for 12 hours, plus maneuvering around that lot is actually pretty stressful with the tight quarters.   This is a pretty popular spot for after hours as well--it's one of the few places open at 3am with a great menu...so expect a wait!"}
{"text":"Good diner food and prices, average service, great hours."}
{"text":"Shrimp & Grits.... the rest is history! Like any other diner it's a very fast paced environment. My server was friendly and more importantly - quick! I definitely recommend the Midnight Diner to all my foodies."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... One time I had to wait 20 minutes on a Friday, and one time there was no wait on a Wednesday. When there is a line, THERE IS A FUCKING LINE!!!!!   There were so many ghetto drunk people on the Friday night it was appauling how some people behaved. I was thankful for the heavy police presence.   I had shrimp and grits both times and both times it was the tastiest thing you could find to eat at midnight. There service is good for how many people they have to deal with. The tables and booths were clean and despite all the drunkies, the bathroom was surprisingly clean. I gave 3.5 stars because nothing else open at midnight has food as good as the grits here."}
{"text":"Update: Jetaun was an amazing server this go round. The food almost felt like it tasted better on this trip. I have no complaints and am so happy I found this lovely diner."}
{"text":"I had some of the lightest, crispest, sweetest Belgian waffles I've ever had at Midnight Diner.  Don't let the lines discourage you, both times I went on the weekend they moved pretty quickly.  But it's obvious that this place is so popular because the food is delicious!!  Highly recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"I arrived in Charlotte relatively late in the evening, and I quickly realized that my meager per dime wasn't going to cover the cost of meals at my hotel. Thankfully, the midnight dinner was open, and a short walk away.  The restaurant was clean, cheap, the service was friendly and good, and the food was very comforting. I had shrimp and grits(excellent), and onion rings (also very good, but more than I could eat; they became a midnight snack later on).  A road weary traveler can't ask for much more in a restaurant. I thank you, Midnight Diner."}
{"text":"So I was back in Charlotte again! I'm from Charlotte, but this place is new to me, seeing I've been gone a few years. My sisters friend brought  us here during our visit... I believe it was late Friday night, right around 10:30PM. So we were there before the club/party people... however it was still full, but we were seated quickly. Our server was friendly, but my water glass stayed empty.  First off... so are you saying I can get breakfast at 10:30PM?!? YES. I'm already inclined to like this place! I had the Midnight Special: Eggs, sausage, grits and pancakes. The do something different to their grits.. those things are super rich and creamy. I'm a grits fan, but I could only eat but so much of them. The pancakes were kind of thick... but they didn't get soggy as fast as IHOPs so that was a plus.   Sister ordered the shrimp and grits and she LOVED it. I'm not a shrimp and grits fan, but I tasted... and tasty it was lol. And my sisters friend ordered steak with eggs and hashbrowns I believe. She said the steak was tender, but it wasn't really seasoned, so the A1 sauce was a must. She comes here often, and was raving about the chicken and waffles.... something to try next time.  This place is definitely a late-night joint and would definitely hit the spot for me simply because I love breakfast at night."}
{"text":"Okay so maybe I did dance with one of the waitresses next to the jukebox. Don't judge me! Heh, the staff is friendly and the jukebox jams will cheer up any unhappy camper. I applaud them for that and keeping their cool when dealing with these obnoxious, immature ruffians at all waking hours from all corners and crevices in which they crawled from (I plead the fifth!).  Nothing glamorous, just your average diner with average food. But, with it being one of the few spots in the QC open 24 hours, how can you go wrong? Automatic bonus points for that and more bonus points for them serving fried chicken and mac 'n cheese alllllll damn day! Can I get an Amen?!"}
{"text":"Best southern meal during my three days in Charlotte.  The waitress was a sweetheart and helped me order something I'll never forget!  Livermush, two eggs over easy, a biscuit and grits.  I like liver, so the taste was up my alley. It's really the texture that surprised me; a super crispy crunchy outside with a pate like texture inside. The biscuit was fluffy and not greasy. The eggs were perfectly runny. But honestly, the grits style the show for me.  I had been haggling my friend to get me some outstanding grits, and by bringing me here; he did. Super creamy and thick with the right amount of salt.   I cleaned my plate better than the guys at my table."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. It is definitely a come as you are kind of place, I love it for that simple reason. Anything on the menu is pure deliciousness. I usually get the Shrimp and Grits, I must say ....it's better than my mother's. Hopefully she never reads this review. The fried chicken is my second favorite, along with the massive French toast. I always intentionally order more than I know I can eat, simply because I love to be in the presence of such wonderful food. Every time I bring someone here they become a believer, I should receive rewards points. You honestly can't go wrong with anything from here at anytime of day. I went in today with my little brother at 4pm and ordered and entire breakfast. Only because I could. If you have never been, I highly recommend. There is also one server who so passionately describes every dish on the menu, you would think he created and cooks them each personally. I could go on forever. But I will stop here.   Enjoy the edible."}
{"text":"The server basically stole $2 from my husband. Point is - you never pocket a customers cash change. We placed a call in pick-up order. He paid with extra and was due back change along with my sister in law's order with over $5 due back in change. The service with the cashier she basically cashed them out and picked change for both orders! Processed to leave the counter, well over 5min they waited for her to give change and utensils, ketchup etc. She avoided them. They asked her, for items by raising their voice over the crowd so she could give her attention. She then responded \"oh are you waiting for change too? Let me do that\" she proceeded to avoid them.. well after 10min they asked another sever for utensils and Left! How ridiculous. How can you work for a tip off a pickup order and basically steal it. Terrible"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have only been once but do not think this place is worth the hype. Even after a few adult beverages, the food wasn't very good and not as cheap as I expected diner food to be. Everything just tasted like salt. Their only saving grace is that they are open 24 hours. Plan to wait if you go anytime between breakfast and 3am though."}
{"text":"Was impressed with my first visit here.  Everything is super shiny and didn't have to wait too long for a table, but I can see this place being packed on the weekends.  We came here after a party at a bar on a Thursday night so we were definitely starving.  The wait staff was nice and seated us right away.  Ordered and the food came out.....  typical diner food - nothing too too special that caught my eye, but good late night food at that.  Add to the fact that I LOVE LOVE breakfast... this place is golden for me.  I can eat breakfast any time of day now with just a visit here."}
{"text":"As I grew up in PA, these types of diners were everywhere - the metal outside, the round counter seats, and booths lining the outside wall of the building.  When you had a group of 5 or more, you knew you had to split up into more than one group as large tables were scarce.  This diner has all of that but they have corner round tables that fit larger groups.  The diner itself is actually larger than some of the other ones I've been to, including another local one, Mattie's.  Service here is what I would expect to find at something like this.  Exceptional when they are not busy but I would imagine it could get pretty chaotic in here at busier times but it's something you just accept from the atmosphere.  The menu is broad and you can get anything at anytime of day.  Breakfast at 4pm, check!  Well actually I was working an early shift at work and got off at 10am and treated myself to breakfast.  I ordered what I typically get for breakfast, an omelette, hashbrowns and a pancake. The omelette was their San Bernadino omelette which came with pico de gallo, sliced avocado and cheddar cheese.  The pancake was huge and dense and quickly absorbed the syrup I put on it.   It was good but not great.  Same with the omelette but the food was nothing to write home about.  I didn't expect it to be.  I came here for the experience.  One downside is I thought their prices were a little high for a diner.  I can get a better omelette, better pancake and better hashbrowns at a place on the other side of Dilworth for cheaper.    But everyone needs to realize when they come here, you come for the atmosphere and to get a decent meal.  It's not a 4-star restaurant and in my book, it shouldn't be. But it is still worth coming to at any time of day!"}
{"text":"good food, good service, classic diner with a counter."}
{"text":"Great place to come and take a load off! It is a bit crowded but it is worth it. Great food well worth the price! They have fresh-cut fries that are really good. There's not a bad seat in the house and you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place. Stood at the front and waited for someone to greet us for almost 5 minutes. Most of my table ordered chicken and french toast. My husband's chicken came out extremely burnt and had to be sent back. I ordered a breakfast plate with eggs, sausage and french toast which was just okay. I was extremely excited to try it,big highly disappointed. I can say our server was great and made good recommendations."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go late night to see the staff cut-up with impromtu dance parties and witty salty come backs. The energy in this place- no matter how long you have to stand in line to get in- makes it all worth it. The food is good- I got chicken and French toast and my friend had a Carolina burger. Both meals were satisfying and delicious. We had a great time and can't wait to come back.  Ps- Vett is awesome and so is Ms. Angela!"}
{"text":"OMG,The Shrimp And Grits are out of this world.I found this place on Yelp and so many people raved about the shrimp and grits with a biscuit,I just had to try it for my self.The Grits were creamy the shrimp were cooked perfectly.I Was in Charlotte for the CIAA tournament and I had to try this place before going back to the ATL."}
{"text":"Best Shrimp and Grits EVER.  Love dining here Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night or all night. Food is fabulous and the staff are warm and welcoming.  If you're downtown for a show the desserts are also very good. My favorite is the apple tart."}
{"text":"The freaking sweet tea is freaking awesome and the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich...well, you'd have to be an ass to mess that up. Now the service: the service is subpar. I have been at least 7 times and half of those times have been orders called in for pickup. The women on the phone are usually pretty rude and rush you off but I guess that is because they are also running around to tables, either way, each customer should get the time they need if they are ordering, paying for their food AND have the opportunity to tip you. When you go in for pickup, you typically have to wrestle an elephant and do a handstand to get anyone to pay attention to you so that you may pay for your food which is sitting RIGHT behind the counter waiting to be paid for and eaten.  Great place to go for the quality of food and is open 24 hours. Will return here so long as I worked 5 minutes from this place."}
{"text":"Your basic diner- that's how I would describe this place. Came here for breakfast- typical breakfast food. Service was fine- waitress was pleasant. Prices were inexpensive. I got a biscuit sandwich- the biscuit itself was wonderful- savory and sweet. Wouldn't mind checking this place out again for lunch or dinner- I heard it's good."}
{"text":"They were packed at night of course! The wait wasn't too bad. Very loud at night because everyone is drunk and hungry. I got the shrimp and grits and it was by far the best I've had. Service was great even tho they were busy. I would go again. Even if I wasn't in the area and I wanted some shrimp and grits. I'd drive there just for it."}
