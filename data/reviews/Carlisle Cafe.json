{"text":"Clearly not quality ingredients. While prices are at the lower end, quality is even lower, I'm sure there is a correlation. Have tried both breakfast and lunch and was not pleased with either. Foods were lacking in flavor and often dry."}
{"text":"Saturday night Prime Rib is excellent. I haven't tried breakfast; but, my mechanic does most days. 
Food is basic home made and very reasonably priced.  I.e. Prime Rib @ $9.95 includes rolls, soup, salad & potatoe. 
The single daily vegatable, apple sauce, cole slaw or cottage can be substituted for any or all of the above.
I have had an occassioable selection that didn't match my palate. Soups are home made daily & usually superb; I had one I didn't like."}
{"text":"Stopped by with family on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes.Arrived nice and hot and very tasty. Very friendly service. Loved the Fiestaware!"}
{"text":"The food is really bland and somehow they manage to both under- and overcook it. It's also predominantly frequented by the elderly crowd which is adorable, but that and the friendly service are the only reasons my review is two stars and not one.

I've had a vast array of foods here: omelettes, pancakes, breakfast specials. None of which have been very good, but for some reason, my grandma really likes it. So I keep getting return visits. Maybe one day, I'll find that one dish that I can enjoy at this restaurant. But until then, I guess I'll just get to push eggs around on my plate with my fork while my grandma talks about our cousins' new babies."}
