{"text":"Great food, terrific service and a really good vibe. The staff is friendly and relaxed but they don't miss a beat. The menu is interesting, the ingredients fresh and the food is delicious. The room is small but very comfortable and has a great feel.  One of the best new restaurants to open in Toronto in a long time.  Loved it !"}
{"text":"Dined here a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night -- actually sat at the bar with my three fellow diners and had an absolutely amazing evening -- food, wine, service all made for a perfect experience.  Tried almost all the appetizers and 'small plates' and they were exceptional. Standouts were: almond spread, harcha bread, quinoa salad, beef kefta  Shared a fish tagine for 4 and it was also excellent!  Highly recommend this place - I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is nice, pretty solid, good flavours. However, the dining area is tiny and the seating is cramped. You will be seated inches away from your neighbour and you will be able to hear their conversation, and vice-versa. It feels very claustrophobic, which is why I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Full score: 3.5/5  Dinner at the new middle-eastern'ish Resto opened by the guys who run Cava.  Where it's like Cava- friendly staff, nice ambience (though Cava is one of our all time faves anywhere), price point  Where it needs to make improvement to join Cava: quality of food, wine (e.g. Offering corkage which atlas doesn't)  Other quibbles: tables are way too small for tapas, a/c started to drip a bit towards the end of the night, the Norman Hardie Riesling was nearly priced at 3.5x lcbo price (at least do so for bottles hardie doesn't sell at the lcbo etc)  But these guys seem to be able to pack it in every night, so not sure how much of an incentive there is to change."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Manager Chloe is incredible, as well. They really care about their food and their customers. A must-visit"}
{"text":"Funny how a Toronto life review from Mark Pupo will change everyone's mind. Pupo just scored this place 4 stars, not deserved. Here is the low down on this resto. 2 stars for service and effort. I spend quite a lot of time in morocco. This is not authentic food. I understand that. It's Canada. I'm not judging authenticity. I went weeks after their opening and maybe they don't have their stuff together. The goat dish was inedible. The barnyard smell was really really bad, not sure if the cooks tasted what they cooked. All the other dishes was not memorable. Small plates expensive. The crowd up in DuPont was a yawn. Dining with all white folks 60 plus."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in a long long time. If you're a fan of Chabrol you will love this place. Came here for dinner with a friend this evening - and was immediately taken with the tiny cozy comfortable interior. We started with cocktails which were both delicious. I had the fizz one (forgot the name) and my friend had the Manhattan which was probably one of the best manhattans in the city. We started with some dips and flatbread. Highly highly recommend the eggplant dip as well as the buttermilk cheese spread. Both were so good we licked the plates clean (and so did the couple next to us). Next we had the mushroom phyllo pastry - if you like mushrooms and cilantro this dish is for you. Everything just kept getting better and better. For our mains we shared the trout with a side of roasted peppers. I wish the peppers were served warm but other than that no complaints. The trout was to die for - my companion and I unanimously declared it the best trout we've ever had - ever - and - as became customary during this meal - we licked our plates clean. Everything was aromatic and seasoned to perfection. Nothing was too heavy or too big leaving you feeling over full. We had both the lavender scented cake over poached pears, and the chocolate tart with pistachio ice cream for dessert. I'd recommend staying away from the cake and pears - it was good - but it wasn't GREAT. The flavours were a bit muted making it feel a little bit bland. The chocolate tart though - that was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Fresh pistachio ice cream was the perfect accompaniment. Service was excellent - wine selection was also excellent. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for a really good quality and memorable meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant opened four days ago, and you can tell that they are still working out the kinks.   It's a small venue with only about a handful of table. Certainly not an ideal place for groups, and better suited to tables of 2-4 diners. They have a partially open kitchen so the four seats at the bar overlook the chefs. As a result, or possibly due to the building itself, the ventilation is very poor here causing the room to be really warm - to the point that they had to open to front door to cool things down. This meant that we had to fluctuate between asking for the door to be opened and closed throughout our meal.  The servers are definitely still learning the menu / the lay of the restaurant. I started as the first person to make my order and after I ordered two dishes, the server stopped me to describe what an appropriate amount of food was for our table for four and what she would suggest. Really, this should have happened when we were all initially seated and before we started to peruse the menu. The first dish I ordered was from the \"small\" section and it was a plate of cinnamon roasted beets with preserved lemon. When I asked for it, she remarked the the dish was a lot of beets! Our table laughed when we received the plate because in actuality it was quite small and it would be easy enough for someone to eat on their own. You could really taste the cinnamon and I did not detect the preserved lemon. Also, although not described on the menu, it comes on top of a layer of yogurt / cream - just in case you don't eat dairy (I don't). Another dish we ordered was the eggplant dip. I didn't particularly like it. It was more like a macerated bruschetta with bits of eggplant too (the tomato flavour came out more though) and a Seasoning that I did not particularly like. For $10, it was a tiny portion which I thought was overpriced.   Originally, we ordered two tagines, two of the \"small\" dishes, and three of the \"sides\" (steamed carrot salad with raisins, couscous, and horchata - a fried buttery biscuit). This was way too much food and we canceled the second tagine after we could barely finish the first.   While the food was interesting, I don't think I would rush back anytime soon, because it wasn't the type of food that blew me away and left me craving it over and over again."}
{"text":"After visiting Atlas, I firmly believe that Niall and Doug can do no wrong. Cava and Chabrol are amazing restaurants and Atlas is no different. From the service to the food, every part of my first (but certainly not last) dinner at Atlas was fantastic. I have to admit that when I first sat down and looked at the menu I was a bit lost as I am not very familiar with Moroccan cuisine, but our lovely and knowledgeable waitress was more than happy to assist us. All of her recommendations were delicious - we tried the dips (the eggplant one is amazing), flatbread, harcha, beef kefta (a must try!), couscous, quinoa salad, and both tagines (cod and goat). I cannot recommend the goat tagine enough - everyone at the table loved it!   I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu and cocktails!"}
{"text":"It was such a great experience and amazing food. Subtle flavours, just the perfect food amounts on top of a great service from all the staff. A definite option that would like to repeat! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Atlas is Doug Penfold's (Cava, Chabrol) newest restaurant that's a culinary ode to his travels through Morocco. It was appropriately named after the 2,500 kilometre mountain range that stretches through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The menu showcases the country's regional diversity with everything from traditional tagines to keftas.  Penfold must have a penchant for small spaces, because Atlas, like Cava and Chabrol, is tucked away in tiny space off of Dupont Street, completely unmarked. I second guessed myself before entering as I thought I was interrupting a private soir√©e. Walking in felt very welcoming--as if I was opening the door to a friend's house. The high-ceiling space was bright and minimalist with decorative wood paneling and light fixtures accenting the room in all the right places. Wine bottles stretched up to the ceiling behind the bar and doubled as an interesting art installation.  After a brief but exceptionally warm greeting from our server, Jerry, my guest and I agreed that he was made for this job. He was a born storyteller. He walked us through the menu as if we were guests in his home, sharing the details of how Penfold created each dish--to the point where my mouth was watering. He explained that the roasted peppers and aubergines were charcoal grilled on an open flame out back. When my guest and I had our first bites of the eggplant zaalouk--a room-temperature dip made of eggplants, tomatoes, herbs and spices--we could taste the love that was poured into its creation. Jerry's storytelling compensated for the subpar food, minus a few exceptions."}
