{"text":"This is an excellent place. Thanks to the professional staff. It's a good place to visit. Say hello to Laura when you go there! Very nice person. She makes you like you are at home."}
{"text":"Nice, bright and new (Q4 2012 opening) there is little else worth noting here.  While service was friendly, they seemed new at this pub/food service thing...    While food expectations were low, they failed to live up.  Try Axis, 3030, or Hole in the Wall on the same block if you are looking for a drink... if you are looking to watch the game... head over to Bloor West Village or downtown."}
{"text":"Very smal (cozy) bar, with great service & a patio.  Did not try the food, but this is a pretty damn cool little local bar with more flatscreen TV's per square foot than any bar on the planet."}
{"text":"Fine little sports bar with friendly service. Large HD screens everywhere with the volume up  Classic hard rock on the speakers at other times. Good drink specials and a relaxed atmosphere. Populated by regulars and the pub food is good. Having multiple drinks is totally acceptable here. Michelle and Laura are great bartenders."}
