{"text":"Being from New York and having had burgers all over the place I thought I could never find better than I've had. After three bites of a double I said to my wife this is the best burger I've ever had! I said to the chef on the way out I give my compliments to you!"}
{"text":"really good little place, it stays busy, but the food comes out pretty quick. nice to have a place like this in monroe, onion rings were good. prices are good, i think its nice to support local places."}
{"text":"Carolina slaw burger was great. Onion rings spit on. Good dive place. Looking forward to the liver mush next time."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We all loved our cheeseburgers.  First timer for slaw on a burger and it was fantastic.  (Wasn't brave enough to try chili AND slaw). Onion rings are great also.  Thank you Yelp for a great find."}
{"text":"Best burger in North Carolina! Duke's has been one of my favorites since a little kid. Always stop by when I'm in the area. Try the banana pudding and the fries are superb as well."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a nice old fashioned hamburger, this is the place for you. with great customer service and delicious food for very low prices you cant go wrong. and a bonus , their ranch is make from scratch! you gotta love some good buttermilk ranch :)"}
{"text":"I had tried this place once before about 3 years ago had a great burger and fries took my girl today to have a burger and fries Burger came out so fast and dry it felt like it was precooked and tasted terrible fries are Ore-Ida crinkle cut Frozen think about 250 an order Burger was served in a wrapper much like McDonald's but the bill wasn't like McDonald's it was $23 for two cheese bacon burgers one order fries two medium drinks also noted the cook did not have gloves on his hand when handling the onion rings very disappointed probably not go back again I don't know how come it changed so drastic"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Gave me the wrong food came back asked nicely, they said it was my mistake did not want to refund my money and they thought I was lying. The food is also a pile of grease, would not return at ALL."}
{"text":"Great place Wonderful place Be sure to use your cell phone while in there to invite your friends to join you!!"}
{"text":"Monroe can certainly be proud of the establishment on the corner of Phifer and Concord. Located in an unassuming location off the grid of chain fast food and strip malls is a treasure to be experienced. Dukes takes the usual burger fare on a whole new level of realm. Nowhere have I had a more delightful hamburger than the \"all the way\" one experienced today.  The bun was surpurb and complement the ample fixin's on the perfectly cooked meat. Along with beautiful onion rings and a Diet Coke that was topped off every few minutes, I was happily in nirvana. Highly recommend this joint and Monroe should be proud of it"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time, but when the current owner said no cell phones and included fire pagers and radios that was the end of me eating there. I am ok with the no cell phone policy, but I cannot get behind the fire radios and pager issue. Just because we stop to eat volunteer or paid we are available 24/7 for the people we serve. When they decide if they ever do to allow these devices to be left on I will again visit there establishment until then NO."}
{"text":"Good burgers that used to be better ten years ago. Also don't understand putting 41 signs in a 900 sq ft room that say to turn off your cell phones but then all the ads on the tables have QR Scanner codes.  Asked the cashier about this ridiculousness and I'm not sure she even knew what a QR Scanner was.  Sad cuz this place was my favorite place in Monroe when I first was introduced to it in 2002."}
{"text":"Best burger anywhere!  Been going here since I was little.  They make their own chilli and slaw that are out of this world good!  Hotdogs are very good too.  Love this place!!!  There is no other place like it or as good!"}
{"text":"Going by Yelp reviews, we stopped on a Wednesday at 2:00 p.m.  Well, folks, I read all of these reviews and I have to tell you that while the Duke's hamburger is definitely different, it certainly is not the best hamburger I've ever  had.  For starters it came to us much too quickly, proof that it was not cooked to order as any hamburger worth it's salt would be.  It is not served on a plate but wrapped and placed in front of you like a fast food drive-in.  It is also quite messy with the slaw and chili so if you wished to try eating it with a knife and fork, sorry not an option.  As other reviewers have noted the French fries are so ho-hum that chips would be a better choice.  No lemonade available, so no Arnold Palmer...a rare occurrence.  Warning, the restrooms are outside and don't have a sink.  When I asked at the counter if there was some place to wash my hands I was directed to a sink in the seating area, right next to a couple having a meal.  So, think of it, I have just used the toilet and have to wait until I get into the food area before I can wash my hands.  How many door knobs, etc. have I, and others touched between there and here?   Lastly, there are signs everywhere asking you to please silence cell phones.  Don't make the mistake I did by trying to listen to something on my iPad.  They think that's a cell phone, too.  And this is a place with so much background noise from air conditioning units that we had to move once just to hear one another speak.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive...the best part of the experience.  Bottom line, I don't recommend spending any time off of 74 to find it.  Leave it to the locals."}
{"text":"First of all, i now remember why i stopped eating here about 10 years ago...the employees where rude, not out going at all. I asked for a to-go kids meal and they said that they don't do kid meals to go!?!? I asked why and they said they don't have anything to put it in...here's a thought, (wrap it in paper and throw it in a bag, like you do the rest of the food!). Secondly, if I seen 1, I seen 20 signs hanging up all over the place, telling everyone to cut off there mobile communication devices. Here's another thought, these customers are paying your bills, so if they want or need their communications devices left on, then they should have the right...don't be rude about it. Thirdly, I ordered myself a double cheeseburger, fries, and a regular tea, my two small sons a cheeseburger, fries, and two regular drinks, and my 5 year old daughter, a ham sandwich and fries and a child's milk and my bill was $41 and change. So to conclude, I paid $41+ dollars, to walk in, speak to some employees, with no personality, had to cut off my cell phone, couldn't get a kids meal to go, and got charged a small fortune for a few burgers. I can assure ya, that will be the last $41 they get from me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Everyone is always so nice and the food comes out very quick. Great burgers and BBQ! I've never eaten anything here I didn't like! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Monroe!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to eat the food. The waitress was pleasant and wonderfully hopeful but a parolee guy working in the kitchen was quite arrogant and rude. Not the small town experience you'd expect and hope for."}
{"text":"Drove from columbia to find them closed for a vaction .yelp was showing them open . Drag ! Now i know how Clarke Grizzwold felt when Wally World was closed !"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite \"dive\" and carolina style cheeseburger in the greater Charlotte area.  Onion rings great as well.  Haven't ever visited during breakfast hours.  Usually call ahead for a cheeseburger or two to-go whenever I'm driving through the area."}
{"text":"I totally hate it when a well-known local landmark disappoints. I've eaten here several times previously and usually order a hot dog and fries, however, this time I ordered a hot dog and onion rings. My all-the-way hot dog was good - for sure, but I would rather have mustard on it instead of ketchup; this southern girl has always known \"all the way\" to mean mustard, slaw, chili, and onions. As for the onion rings, the minute they hit the table I could tell they would not be good - they were very greasy looking, and one bite proved to be nothing but greasy crust with little to no onion. At $3.50 for a small order of onion rings, they need to be South-21 or BBQ-King perfect - or at least close to.  When I went to the counter with them,  it was almost as if the cook was offended, \"Greasy???\" - he asked, until I showed him. This time, I ordered my regular fries. Now, to be fair: for as bad as the onion rings were, the french fries were equally as GOOD - fried to perfection, in my book. The sweet tea isn't too sweet and the unsweetened tea is very good. My waitress was attentive and on her game.   Pro tip:  upon entry - WATCH YOUR STEP!  There is a small step-up at the entry that really needs a warning sign. Watch for it so you don't trip up it and face plant into the glass door."}
{"text":"A burger topped with chili and slaw?  This Texan was a little confused but very satisfied.  Simple yet done right."}
{"text":"I love this place, since moving to NC, I've been coming here for about a year, I've never been disappointed, no wonder it got all the TV attention that it did... The burgers really are the best... Same burger recipe for over 60 years... And it's just fun to be there, it's a throw back to fun times and memories... Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"They have excellent burgers worth craving, but they still have a silly no cellphone conversation policy so I feel weird every time I go eat there alone, because I feel like they let 2 or more people sitting there talk to each other, but if I eat alone, which I often have to do, then they won't let me talk on the phone with anyone to keep me company if I need it.  Therefore I feel kind of discriminated against as a solo diner who has to eat alone almost every time, and I feel like I'm taking up a table they want for at least 2 people even if there's one for 2 or 4 with no one waiting, depending on the time of the day.  I sometimes go at non peak hours just to avoid a crowded situation when they might need every seat.  I've worked as waitstaff so I know the disappointment when you want a 4 top and get a solo.  And they don't have counter seating so I can't just take a single seat, and so I never eat there unless it's with someone, and so I just about always have to get take out and eat in the parking lot with my dog.  And I wish they would take the sign off so people like me, whether lonely or not, and whether we prefer to eat alone or not, can eat at a favorite local place without feeling even more alone and ostracized than we already are.    And I'm sorry, but I'll just have to keep reviewing Duke's Grill with my honest opinion every time I go there, and I guess we'll just have to see how often I crave their burgers, which honestly could be a lot because they're that good.  I just don't know why they have to treat people that way and make them feel bad just to eat their food, because they look like nice and decent people to me and their message on the menu and tables sort of feel that way too.  I'm just disappointed in them, that's all.  Oh, and I'm sorry to have to add this theory, but I was in the back of the building sitting in my car and smoking with my dog when this nice woman came out and handed us our burger, and I thought that was nice of her to come out and find me, and they do that for me at McDonald's too.  Like last night this nice woman came out and handed me my bag while I was smoking and timed it wrong, and then another time a nice guy came out and found me in the dining room when I was kind of hiding in the corner by myself even thought the place was empty, just so I could have sight lines on who was coming in because I'm like that, and so yeah I appreciate it when then come find me with the food.  But then I was thinking about it, and it's like they knew exactly where to look for me, out the back door.  And so I'm analyzing things, because that's kinda what I do for a living, and I think hmmm what if they keep that up because they know that a lot of guys who eat alone are contractors or guys on the job, and yeah a lot of those guys eat as a crew, that's why they're called crew cars, which I seriously need me a couple for this crazy mission from God or whoever, and so I'm thinking, hmmm what if they just keep it up because they don't want any freaking Latinos or other minority working guys to go there or show up to protest or anything, because they know that those working stiffs and even the white working stiffs who don't have all day to sit there enjoying their 4 person genteel Southern lunch can, and so they just freaking keep keeping the sign up with a smug attitude like I also felt from the customers if not the owners.  The owners were too busy trying to keep up with orders and their livelihood to offend their old regular customers who sit there all day with their snugness, but then tell the owners not to back down to people like us, the minorities and working stills who actually help run this country and everywhere else.  Some of us minorities are the geniuses and super genius that help this country, including me, a Naturalized United States Citizen and just glad somebody had the wisdom to bring me to this country so I can fight for her like everyone else, and some of my Japanese ancestors who already died once and went unrecognized like those of the US 442 regiment who remain the #1 most awarded force for its size and length of service.   Why can't men who died for this country, as well as immigrants who are willing to, not be able to sit at a table or shoot darts or play pool at the VFW together as veterans and their family?  Why should he feel unwelcomed just because he got to the fight or the dance a little bit late, and why should be alone and fit only for eating out the back door?  I'm thinking we're just going to have a Flash Mob hit Dukes and take down their sign, and either get them to take the sign down in a fun and helpful way, or make it an ugly scene with people linking up by race or age or ethnic background and next thing you know we've got people lined up all over who haven't even enjoyed Duke's Grill's burgers like I have, and I just don't want that."}
{"text":"Awesome Burger's, took two Wingate students there, they won't be eating burgers on campus again!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable.  Love the no cell phone rule.  The burgers are just delicious."}
{"text":"In Monroe for work this week, so i decided to give Dukes a chance. Im so glad i did best burger i have had in a very long time, wonderful onion rings. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Food was made fast and fresh. This place has that down home feel to it, very comfortable environment. Will definitely becoming back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I don't know what changed here but I was soooooo embarassed, My parents came to visit North Carolina for the first time and we  told them they had to have dukes famous burgers and when they came out the patties were oval shaped, didn't cover half of th e bun and had no flavor whatsoever...I brought it to the waitresses attention and she shrugged and said hmmph, I'll tell dennis. .whoever that is...my parents were like, we get better food and service at mcdonalds without spending a small fortune like this....talk about embarassed....I highly doubt my family from ny let alone my husband and 4 kids will ever step foot in this place again"}
{"text":"Gotta' try the dukes cheeseburger all the way with onion rings. Worth the trip. Just don't bring in your cell or you might get tossed out."}
{"text":"OMG!! First experience and it was so good!  I ordered a scrambled egg and cheese sandwich. I would definitely go back! Haven't found a place I was crazy about since we moved from Brooklyn, NY and Dukes was spot on!"}
{"text":"Tiny place that if you were not paying attention you might drive right past it, but what is the old adage about good things coming in little packages?  I've been dying for a great burger the last month and while there are a multitude of burger places in Charlotte going for the latest modern trends...I just wanted classic and TASTY!!!  I did some searches and Duke's came up as not only among the best in my area, but in the state of NC where had to investigate going with a friend.  I had a double bacon cheeseburger with onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato...ketchup, mustard, mayo.  It was the BOMB!!!  My friend had a classic Carolina burger with slaw and chili where they about licked the wrapper in delight.   We shared onion rings that were excellent and I had a really great banana pudding as a small desert.  They are a Pepsi shop (thumbs up in my book) where had a diet Pepsi/Cheerwine mix.  Only thing I would change and this is just personal taste is love my Heinz  ketchup where they use Hunts.   We went ~2pm where not too busy, but the place only have seating for about 50 where I'd not suggest hitting it right at noon expecting to get in and out quickly.  Price for all between the friend and I was ~$20 before tip so very reasonable.  Someone else mentioned the place looks like its been in business 50+ years where no debating that...small diner where you expect to see Guy driving up in his red convertible."}
{"text":"Burgers are still good as always.... just don't dig the fries much...  but hey.. the O Rings are fabulous.  Newish hours make it easier to get to that's for sure.... Gotta try breakfast one day as well."}
{"text":"I got the club sandwich and my girl got a burger and onion rings.   All was great.   Order came in literally 5 minutes servers were great.  Refilled my water 5 times.  Nothing fancy....but the food was great and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Burger is great.  I want the stand alone burger next time because the standard bland bun, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, and mustard masked all the good flavor of the burger.  Fries are the fat crinkle cut kind and cooked perfectly.  Friendly staff, comfy environment, and the staff obviously keeps up with cleanliness (in the span of 30 minutes saw them sweep twice and wipe down counters)."}
{"text":"Hi y'all! You want a burger so good it will make you slap yo momma? Then come on down to Duke's!  I came here because I read in business insider magazine this was the best burger in North Carolina. I must say I was extremely impressed. The place sits in a quiet residential neighborhood across from a school.  The burger it's self is perfect in many ways. You have to get the cheeseburger all the way in which comes with: chili and slaw with cheese and then it's pressed together with the burger...omg, it's heavenly.   The fries were nothing out of the ordinary. If I had to describe them I would say they are kind of like the fries you get at a high school football game.  The sweet tea was excellent, just the thing I expect being in the south.  I also got the banana pudding, which was average."}
{"text":"Duke's Grill,How to start?Small place,Big on taste and service.My son and daughter in law live close to Duke's,she and her family have eat a many a burger and fries here over the years to say the least.Well when we got to Dukes they where busy and their was six of us one very pregnant and the other large(me)!We could not fit in the booths,we some us so we decided wait on a table.Duke's is small so we waited outside maybe 10 Minutes or so  and in we went.Our waitress was quick with our menu's and our drinks. Now of course a new spot to me I choose a cheeseburger and a hot dog and fries as did my youngest son.Most all at the table got a burger.Some got Orin's some got fries.My oldest son had a Hamburger Steak grilled onions fries and a big ol tea.I was warned not to get the double and I'm glad I did not.Our cheese burgers came with a big portion of beef let,tom,mayo.Just right.Some chose must,chili and slaw.I got my dog all the way.Duke's has a good chili and a good hotdog to go with it. Onion Rings where good just like the fries.Our waitress kept our glasses full and was very pleasant.They did know some of the family.Our experience was a good one and I am looking forward to our next trip.ONE Thing To REMEMBER WHILE IN Duke's TURN Off YOUR CELL PHONES big sign when you come in the door.Was nice we actually talked to each other.Kinda nice."}
{"text":"What a great local business.  Friendly local service, great burgers and sides.  This is a classic Carolina burger joint.  Extremely clean and well organized.  Burgers are good sized and served with your choice of toppings, however I would suggest the special for locals.  Yankees might want to clarify what they want on them.  Hot crispy crinkle fries and crispy onion rings.  Very good unsweetened tea.  I hate I did not find this place years ago."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but the vibe in the restaurant isn't very gratifying or satisfying. The vibe makes \"Me\" feel as if \"I\" don't belong in there and they are sometimes rude. but That wont stop me from spending my money there. my money spends the same as everyone else"}
{"text":"Super awesome burger Joint. Everything is old school. Hand made burger patties and awesome onion rings. A must visit."}
{"text":"Duke's is absolutely delicious! Down south atmosphere, tiny parking lot, and great service. You'll never leave here hungry."}
{"text":"I have been going to dukes for over 20 years and my cheeseburger are always great! My fries or onion rings always good I thank you so very much for the no cell phones I am on my all the time and to turn it off to get peace of mind is great! The help has always been so very nice and very helpful thank you so much I love you guys so very much!"}
{"text":"Came to Dukes on the recommendations of Yelp users. Very small setting, it has that Diners Drive ins and Dives vibe.  I ordered a Hamburger, Small fry and a 1/2 cheerwine 1/2 Pepsi mix. The the hamburger do not fit the bun but it tasted great. The fries were a little undercooked, I like mine well done. Next time I'll ask for them well done.   I will definitely be back and I will definitely tell anybody to come here. great place!  And the waitresses are awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Monroe on business, and all of the engineers I was meeting with swear by Duke's.  So, they took me with them to lunch.   I had the chili slaw dog with onions and a side of onion rings.  I'm from the Atlanta area, so my gold standard for chili slaw dogs is The Varsity.  This place is just as good.  The onion rings are also very good.   The only detractors for me are the weird \"no cell phone\" policy and the place is way too small for the steady crowd of traffic visiting the restaurant.  But the food can't be beat.  This is your quintessential hole in the wall burger joint.  If you love good hot dogs and burgers and you're in the area, you gotta try this place."}
{"text":"If you are in the area the all the way cheeseburger with chili and slaw is a must have experience in a divey old time joint. It is a messy monster but cheap and huge in an off the beaten path neighborhood a true local experience. Try it you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Florida and i read the reviews for Dukes.  Went there yesterday with my son. We ordered the cheseburgers all the way and the onion rings.  My son ordered lemonade and i ordered watrr with  lemon.   The server arrogantly said we have no lemon.  Ok I'll  just have the  water.  Burgers and onion rings were good but not great.  Got the bill prices were not listed on it.  Paid the bill and went outside.  Looked at bill and saw a charge for $,45.  Curous i went in and asked what the 45cents was for.  The cashier/server arrogantly said WATER.  45 cents for a Styrofoam  cup of WATER.  That's  ridiculous."}
{"text":"After visiting another local legend (Brooks in the Noda area) the day prior, we stopped by Dukes to taste their wares and compare. They differ in that they also include slaw on their all-the-way burger. This addition makes the burger super flavorful. Dukes is also slam packed but has a bit more flexible hours and also inside seating available.  This place is no frills- but the food is very good. I tried both fries and onion rings and both were tasty. The winner overall is the cheeseburger though, that was one delicious, juicy, tasty burger.   If you ever get a chance to take the trip up from Charlotte- definitely stop by Dukes!  By the way...No cell phones, they don't like it and it is apparent from the signs plastering the walls lol But your mouth will be too busy eating to talk anyway so who cares!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a long time. Maybe ever. Excellent food, service, and old country ambience. Ate there today and will eat again there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Good lunch menu. The double burger with chili and coleslaw is great. Onion rings are plentiful and good."}
{"text":"Always amazing food!  Best place for a burger in Monroe!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the Travel Channel and decided to give it a try, glad I did.  One of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. The fries could be better but no big deal there. Great food and I love that old school burger joint atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overpriced, or I was overcharged.. Stopped for a To-Go order on the way to go mattress shopping at another local store. 2 Burgers, 1 order of Fries, 2 Drinks, an order of banana pudding and 4 napkins were $28.97..?  Do they charge extra for napkins?  or To-Go orders? Maybe the Ketchup Packets? Will not be back!  Although, food was good.."}
{"text":"Great fast food. Burgers (all the way) have been written up as one of the best burgers in town. I am stuck on the BLT. It is simple yet perfect. The high quality bacon and perfect ratio of tomatoes and Duke's mayo make it my choice every time.  Onion rings are great. Don't get the large order of rings unless you are sharing them with a couple of people."}
{"text":"OK the only reason I'm giving this place three stars is not for the food but for the old, souther, country ambience. This is a little place and you better not have your cell phone on, ringing or talking, otherwise your ass will get thrown out. The menu is very basic with hamburgers, french fries, hotdogs, BLT etc. Don't even THINK that you're going to be ordering your hamburger at any particular temperature, because it comes to you well done whether you like it or not. The french fries come crisp if you ask for them like that. I got mine with a side of Cole slaw, which if you don't let them know, will be on your hamburger instead of on the side. They cater to the working class people and the bathroom is outside and you need a key but don't expect to wash your hands in there because they have no sink. The sink is in the middle of the dining room. Overall the food is so so nothing to write home about but the place is charming quaint and very old-school which gives it the three stars that they deserve."}
{"text":"Best double cheeseburger I've ever had.  Would have made it a bacon double cheeseburger but bacon is $3.00 more!?!  Atmosphere is super divey.  Softdrinks come in styrofoam cups with the little ice pellets, very classic and it keeps cold for awhile after leaving the restaurant.  Their hours are weird, know that before you drive down from Charlotte.  Parking is sparse.  Weird cell phone policy, I guess they loathe people who talk on their cells in the restaurant.  I can see why, this place is so small that sound travels quickly...the restaurant is kinda claustrophobic actually.  Funny to be anti-cell phone and have QR codes everywhere.   I do have to say though, their burger is even better than 5 Guys and way better than Cook Out or 21 South.  Come here if you get a chance, just know the business hours before you head over."}
{"text":"If you want a burger, Dukes is the only place to go. Cheap and sloppy. Loaded so much you almost have up use a fork. Love mine with slaw, chili, onions, mustard, mayo and ketchup. Take cash with you. No cards."}
{"text":"The food was good. The prices however, were not. The place is so little they even have a sign that says \"no cell phones allowed\" and if you are talking on it you will be asked to get off the phone. I wasn't too thrilled about that; and with the prices, you would think the restaurant would look a little better."}
{"text":"I am sad. Why am I sad? I am sad because my phone decided to go on the fritz as I parked at Duke's. I knew that I would not be able to share with you the glory that is the Duke's \"double cheeseburger all the way\" or their fab onion rings. I guess I'll need to come back here one day and have it again.  Yes, the double cheeseburger is an amazing work of culinary art. Two large beef patties, flattened and grilled, topped with slices of American cheese. And with all the way, it included onions, cole slaw, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomato and more. Quite messy and you'll want to grab a fork so that you can pick up the slaw that falls off as you dig through this monster.  Skip the fries. They're boring crinkle cuts and while they're cooked just fine, you can have these anywhere. You want the onion rings, which are thin, crispy and perfect because they're obviously hand cut and hand battered and hand fried. And one order is really enough for three people, or two if one of you can drive the AED.  Yes, I saw it on a list of \"best burger in your state\" and bookmarked it for the next time I was in Monroe. http://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/foodnews/the-best-burger-in-every-state/ss-AA8whNI?fullscreen=true#image=35"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast. It has a really nice atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and efficient. My pancakes were delicious!"}
{"text":"So Business Insider said that Duke's has the best Burger in NC so I went to check it out on a day trip to Charlotte.  With the GPS, the place was easy to find but I'd say if you're visiting Monroe for the first time you could easily drive past it.  It was lunchtime on a Saturday and I was worried about a crowd but luckily we snagged the last available booth.  Let's be honest, the place isn't big on the frills but who needs that stuff any way?  As was recommended on here, I went with the Cheeseburger ATW (all the way) and onion rings.  A Cheerwine was the perfect accompaniment.  The servers were quick and friendly.  I probably got 5 partial refills on Cheerwine over the 20 minutes I was there.    Food came out and I couldn't wait to dig in.  The smell coming off of the burger was intoxicating.  With the first bite I knew this was something awesome.  There was this great flavor combo between the chili and the slaw and beef.  It was darn near perfect.  The onion rings were crispy and well seasoned.  Just how I like them.  Duke's is certainly out of the way for me but that just means I need to make it \"in the way\" more often.  I look forward to returning and taking others with me."}
