{"text":"My chai latte was disgusting. Employees were extra rude & the place was a mess. This was the only thing @ the SLS I have a complaint about."}
{"text":"I was happy to get my coffee at 6 a.m. each morning. It was disappointing that the staff didnt know where the beans came from so I had no idea what kind of coffee I was drinking. I ordered an apple bear claw and it was delicious without being too sweet or dry. I wished they offered macaroons so if anyone is reading this, please add these to your pastries. I couldn't believe a banana costs $2 bucks. I guess I prefer to pay for overpriced pastries than I do for fruit. Overall, I got to know the staff since I hit up this place each day two or three times and they were really nice, service was fast, and I got what I needed."}
{"text":"I stayed at the SLS in early September and absolutely fell in LOVE with the truffle fontina scone!!!! Flaky, savory, just delicious in the AM with a cup of black coffee!!! Chef!!! Can you PLEASE send me the recipe?!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Starbucks. Terrible coffees and food was average. The reason for the extra star, the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries for a quick morning fix.  Strawberry rhubarb danish was tasty!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I make the effort to write a review, and usually I do because Ive had the worse experience ever. That was the case today. First they were scheduled to open at 6a.m but wasnt ready until roughly 6:45, which force a number of us to wait. I ordered a vanilla latte, and the barista said she didnt have flavor lattes but only regular latte and that I would have to wait 30 minutes for a flavor latte. I proceded to get a regular latte and underneath her tongue she said \"asshole\". Now, all I asked her was a simple question. I wont be going back here and to SLS anytime soon. Not only food quality was poor but their customer service reaked."}
{"text":"What claimed to be an acai bowl is made with some kind of sorbet. There was nothing acai bowl about it. The cashier was unfriendly. He did not seem to care. At least he should have warn me before I wasted my money on it. Also their coffee is terrible. We order hazelnut latte and there were no taste/scent of hazelnut. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are there and are in a rush."}
{"text":"It has a great variety of coffee and pastry as well as fruit plates and panini Staff are polite and helpful. My coffee tastes amazing, very happy with it! Come and enjoy a hip breakfast at SLS hotel in Las Vegas  I thought only guests of hotel will be coming here but I was wrong I met lots of locals here that drove for this coffee!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee/pastry shop if you're pressed for time! I ordered their vanilla latté and strawberry danish, both were delicious! There's a long communal table with stools if you want to eat there, or you can just bring your coffee and baked goods up to your room if you want. They also serve fruits and juices if you're looking for healthier options."}
{"text":"Their salads are fantastic.  Same Greek salad served in the Northside Cafe.  Really fresh and yummy.  Grab and go.   Good coffee too.  I just order a black medium roast.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee shop. Located on the main floor of the SLS! My favorite part of this place ? The Almond milk they will make your coffee with. The first time I ordered a cappuccino with Almond Milk. It was awesome.  The Baristas are Patient and kind. Which you do not always get at other places .  They also have some really good breakfast items.  I got an egg and cheese Panini to go , it was a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a cute coffee place! I mean they serve booz- affogatos. Where can you get these in LA? you pick your poison of booze, then you get to choose a scoop of gelato and it's mixed with a shot of coffee. OOSH!  Great way to start off your morning in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick last meal during our stay. At 5pm on a Saturday, there were only two others in line in front of me, though we saw that the line can be epic during the morning (ie 11am).  We ordered a roast beef panini, 2 bags of chips, and a large mint tea and it came to $24.35. Super high for normal rates, but appropriate for Vegas. The panini was presented to us uncut and it took me about 5 minutes, while standing right in front of the barista (with only 1-2 patrons in line), to catch her attention and have it cut in half. No other staff offered to assist or acknowledged that I was there.  That being said, the sandwich was very delicious and we enjoyed it greatly. The seating in the area is ample and it's good people watching. As there are no coffee machines in the hotel rooms, this is a good option on off hours. Otherwise there's also a Starbucks and a McDonalds right across the street if you want something faster."}
{"text":"After eating at ku noodle we passed by perq and decided to try their coffee, we ordered a Carmel vanilla latte iced which is equivalent to a Starbucks macchiato................................ BUT A MILLION TIMES BETTER! It was literally the best coffee I've had! My husband loved it too. I now crave this coffee! Thank you perq for making Starbucks taste like crap.  My life will never be the same."}
{"text":"The Perq is probably one of the best sections in SLS.  A solid place to grab an espresso drink on my way out."}
{"text":"After a drunken stopper at some pool party.  Came back for a quick bite.  decided on the steak sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie.  Both exceptional, cookie was soft and moist and super chocolatey.  More cafe-ish. Service was ultra friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Definitely a cute spot to grab a quick bite and some coffee. Fast and friendly service with a good selection of food and drinks. The salmon pâté was delicious and came with bread. I had to get an apple turnover because it looked good too and for my drive back to la.   I agree with some reviewers; no idea for the low Yelp rating; but it's definitely a stop to check o"}
{"text":"They make a mean macchiato. It was perfect. Service is quick and good location; however, I learned from my friend the food wasn't very good."}
{"text":"The little cafe was the best! Travis was very friendly and helpful. He was very attentive and smiled the entire time he was serving us. Coffee was delicious and strong just how I like it. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family. I look forward to coming back to The Perq and trying their variety of pastries. Everyone seems very nice but Travis was the one that checked us out and made our coffee. Hopefully next time we go he's there and can once again give us the great service he has to offer."}
{"text":"Wife ordered an iced caramel vanilla latte. She only drank 1/4 of it as it was super bitter. They do have syrups that you can add your self but it has never seemed to be much of a problem for her before. A friend went with her and ordered a hot caramel latte with the same result. Disappointed."}
{"text":"All I can say is eh.... It did not impress. I figured it being on the strip and being in the SLS.... That service and knowledge would matter more. I'm going to say no. Service and knowledge both were a no go.   The \"kids\" working the counter have no idea what service is. I walked up to the counter to get some hot tea. And one girl greeted me right away with what would u like? I say I'm looking... There is no one else in line behind me but not even a minute later the same girl asks me with attitude what I would like.  So I ask her if the tea is a loose leaf or bagged.  She answered that it is loose leaf but I see no French presses in sight.... So I ask her how is it served. She kind of rolls her eyes and says uh its served in a cup as she points to one of their cups. At this point I'm wondering how u serve loose tea with no French press an no tea pot in sight.   Well apparently they do not know the difference between loose leaf tea and bagged tea since the tea that they have me was a bagged tea.  When I asked the girl that answered loose leaf tea.... She said... \"Uh its loose leaf in a bag\"....uuummmm.... The last time I looked that was called BAGGED tea! Duh!  Then as I was walking off a lady came up to the gelato counter and asked the guy what the difference between ice cream and gelato was. He starts the answer with well gelato is cream based.... Seriously do they not train their staff at all???  Then as I was walking out of there about 15 minutes later.... There are 4 of them huddled together by the counter talking a mile a minute while all the tables in the coffee shop are filthy.  Really???   And on another note is SLS so cheap that they can't fix the tables? All the tables were wobbly and I almost spilled burning hot tea all over me...   SLS.... Fix your equipment!!!  Train your staff!!!"}
{"text":"Got a iced mocha drink here it was soooo disgusting. Tastes artificial and my drink came up to 8 dollars it was not worth it at all!!! Worst drink I have ever drank.."}
{"text":"During our stay at SLS Vegas, my wife and I enjoyed the place.  They have some great coffee... but I guess the problem is consistency of the quality of the coffee..  First time we went there, we got latte with hazelnut. It was great... Second time we visited we had a cup of americano... was also nice...  But our last visit, we got latte with hazelnut and latte with chocolate. (with blueberry pie). We were checking out so we took the drinks and had a first sip in the car.   It was terrible... it didn't taste like latte... it felt like americano with syrups.. We couldn't finish the coffee and had to stop at one of the Starbucks to get another latte.  If they get you the right drink... I bet you will enjoy it..  :)"}
{"text":"i had the glazed cinnamon roll for breakfast 2x during my business trip.  and it was divine!  it's fluffy, not dense, and not overly sweet.  yes, it was $4.25 for the cinnamon roll but it was still good!  wished they had offered to warm it up but it was not bad.  the perq is just like a starbucks...  lots of grab and go food options and plenty of beverages.  i like the communal table seating, but never did spend time lingering around because i was on the go!"}
{"text":"I gave this place two chances, but they seemed to screw it up again, so here's my review!   The first time I came here, I was the only person in line. Although there was not a single person in front or behind me, I had to wait 5 MINUTES for the 2 girls at the register to finish their conversation about their boyfriends. When they finally decided to take my order, they gave me a dirty look asking \"what do you want...\", as if I was taking away from their precious time together.  They didn't thank me for my business either.  They just turned back around and continued gabbing about their love lives. How romantic.   This morning, I came by to get my coffee. There was a male cashier that was friendly, but the coffee was lukewarm. When I realized this in my hotel room, I came back down and asked if they had a microwave to heat it up. There was a female cashier helping me this time, and she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if I could get another coffee that I could see was just being brewed at the time, and they said no & I would have to pay their ridiculous prices again.   Sad."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the soy green tea latte with vanilla was made chai but corrected. The correction was made quickly but it was the worst green tea latte ever. I tried stirring it, thinking maybe it was the foam. Nope! This was just awful. I didn't address with staff as I had to leave, so I tossed it. $7 loss ..."}
{"text":"Honestly I have no idea how this place only has 3 stars and I'm an avid coffee drinker. In LA we have plenty of nice coffee shops and roasters, and I must say if The Perq was in LA it would be competing with the Intellegencia and Alfred's of the world.  Beautifully strong roasted coffee with a kick. Their iced mochas and vanilla iced mochas were amazing!  Their cold brew was a little watered down but still better than Starbucks/coffee bean.  Blueberry muffin is so moist and fresh. It really made our SLS experienced a good one. We wasted no time trying to find a local coffee house with decent coffee because we had a exceptionally good one in house!  FIVE STAR!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastries! You have to try their huge chocolate chip cookies. They are the size of your hand, and are oozing with chocolate."}
{"text":"I love love love the Perq! It's a perfect little coffee shop inside the Sls and the W! It's absolutely yummy! I truly love their earl grey latte it's a perfect balance of lavender and vanilla I just love it! I am equally torn though every time I order though because their masala chai is to die for here! My fiancé personally really really enjoys their green tea latte! It's a really convenient spot to grab a coffee or a tea or a quick pastry while staying in the casino! The staff here is super duper friendly and they have really good baristas! I really like their chocolate croissants and their cherry danish! Especially when they warm them up! I highly recommend you skip trying to find a Starbucks because Starbucks is crap compared to The Perq and I personally enjoy Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Got coffee because there are no coffee makers in SLS rooms. It is a Starbucks but the prices are double. Large coffee is 5 dollars. Coffee was not as good as Starbucks IMHO."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Everyone one was smiling and so polite, it made my morning. Especially Mariana and Roman who helped with my order. I'm a local and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The coffee was good ($4/cup, but what can you expect from a Vegas casino). There wasn't much to eat though, just croissants and muffins."}
{"text":"What more can I say, it got the job done! After putting in works at the buffets all we wanted for breakfast was some coffee and something to snack on. If you are looking for something other than Starbucks, you came to the right place.  They have wifi and a variety of pastries. Granted it's not the cheapest BUT take into consideration that it is at a hotel and you are paying for convenience.  Enjoy your stay!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, and serving up a good beverage.  That's really all I need from a coffee bar experience, and this little nook in the SLS Las Vegas didn't disappoint.    I'd say that while some people here are complaining about the staff and \"service\", my drinks from here were fast and flavorful, and the staff were good about taking my vouchers from the SLS' VIP lounge, so nothing to complain about there.  As for the beverages themselves - my fave would have to be the masala chai latte.  Strong and spicy, it helped knock back a sore throat in a matter of minutes and helped me get back on my feet when I needed it.  As for the food, their apple turnover is a great breakfast snack not to be overlooked.  All in all - a good deal and just what I was in the mood for in the morning."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. A great place for coffee and snacks. True café feel. And Savanna made me a great cappuccino! It's hard to find a place that actually knows how to make a decent cappuccino! Will definitely stop here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Yikes. How can a macchiato be so terrible? It tastes like what I imagine gasoline might taste like. And I like my coffee and espresso strong."}
{"text":"People & service were great. The pastries were delicious. The coffee was too bitter for my taste otherwise I liked this place alot. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Yummy cinnamon rolls, apple pastries, and delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered 2 small hot mochas early one morning. After paying, we stood back and watched countless customers receiving their drinks before us. Nearly 10 minutes later, after inquiring about our drinks, we received our mochas with not even a hint of an apology. Needless to say, the mochas were not worth the $6 price tag for such a small unimpressive drink, nor the long wait."}
{"text":"Staff is really friendly and the strawberry rhubarb danish was so good!"}
{"text":"They have coffee and a steady stream of WIFI.   Sometimes just having the basics is all a coffee shop in a hotel really needs to keep the gambling, rambling, and scrambling masses happy.   I stopped in here to get a little pick-me-up before a meeting I had in the vicinity. The coffee here is decent, I would go as far to say better than Starbucks, which isn't saying much. I mean you cover anything in enough foam, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream and I'm sure it will taste pretty damn good. Go ahead, try it, throw some of those goodies on an old piece chicken or a day old taco... I'll wait. Ok, maybe not those food items, but mixed in with some overly strong and burnt coffee and it does the trick.   Like I was saying the coffee here is very good. Not only do they offer straight up  coffee, but they also offer espresso, mocha lattes, iced coffee, and varying degrees of caffeinated happiness. They also have stuff for the hunger pains, the basics like breakfast sandwiches and fruit plates. I commend the SLS for not going the for corporate coffee route and deciding to use a relatively unknown coffee house.   When looking for a wake up call and you're near the SLS. Pop-in and try Perq."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a quick bite one morning. I got a vanilla iced coffee and bacon/cheese quiche and my husband ordered a cinnamon roll. Both items were warm and delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful, cute little area near check-in. I'd definitely stop in here again!"}
{"text":"Their Gelatos here are fantastic. Smalls are $5 and the Large was $7.50.   My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet after eating out at Umami. All we could smell was the perfect blend of coffee down the hall and we stop for the Gelato.  I'm so glad we did. Yummmy!  We split a large Dark Chocolate.   They have Nutella, but I recently found out that they may contain peanuts... So I had to skip it.  The cashier was so friendly we ended up leaving a tip just because she was pleasant, conversant with us because it was slow. It was around 8:15 PM when we stopped by."}
{"text":"I purchased 2 coffees and a strawberry Danish for $12. The coffee was mediocre for the cost. You are better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"As I stood in line to sample the gelato, I noticed there was stepped on pastries and drops of blood on the floor. Both appeared to have been there for a while and I wondered why it was not taken care of because Perq was empty. The gelato sample I was given was minuscule so I could hardly tell if I really liked the gelato. I was thinking about buying a cookie but after seeing the $4.75 price tag I did not see the value.   I ended up speaking to the director of operations and asked why the cookie was priced highly and all he said was he never had a chocolate chip cookie he didn't like. I was hoping he would tell me the quality of ingredients and taste are worth the price. He didn't do a good job convincing me to buy the cookie nor did I feel like he valued my business so I left. If Perq wants to survive charging inflated prices they need to maintain the cleanliness of the shop and be able to sell their product."}
{"text":"Went here numerous times during my visit at the sls, good little coffee shop and no complaints. Yes, it's like every other place in Vegas and over priced but I had a latte every morning and it was great, also had a panini for lunch which was good and a few snack from here."}
{"text":"We're staying at the SLS and the Perq seemed like a super convenient, cute coffee shop. I ordered an acai bowl and an earl grey latte. Both were so incredibly sweet I couldn't even finish them. They weren't cheap either so it was a bit disappointing. The service, as mentioned in other posts, needed some help too.  I wouldn't come here unless staying at the SLS, and if I wasn't so intrigued by the boozy affogato, I wouldn't be back during my stay."}
{"text":"good, strong coffee, better than starfux. Nice paper tote bag for to go items. The hotel is plain,dark, boring and sucks ass, but this is a nice spot for breakfast if you like muffs and shit like that. Blueberry and the chocolate chippy ones are good shit. Also the brioche cinnamon roll is good. The latter not the freshest but it will do. One request please; turn the A/C waaaaaaay the fuck down, feels like your sitting in a freezer at the dining areas goodness gracious."}
{"text":"The Perq is a decent place to get coffee from if you are unfortunate enough to be staying at the SLS (review here: http://www.yelp.com/review_share/9SU7ZZhaFUJJ6m2k5HKHeg/review/f4xpA5nSLJ5QdN3MFNRNLg?fsid=r-IY_boBi6BwuDuLbC0UKA). The lines can get long during peak times (10am-12pm), but otherwise, you can grab a coffee or snack quickly. I ordered an Iced Soy Latte (16oz, $5, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-perq-las-vegas?select=spKRkwBoVBFRfGWhO6IfvA#spKRkwBoVBFRfGWhO6IfvA), which is only available in 16oz and not 12, and it took them less then 5 minutes to ring me up and make my drink. It was an ok tasting soy latte, not amazing but not gross. However, I doubt I'll be back at the Perq since I don't plan on setting foot in the SLS again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why other reviewers aren't feeling the love here. I almost walked by but seeing a LaMarzocco and no Illy coffee silo i opted to turn around. Lamill beans are pulled properly albeit into paper cups. Paper cups and casino pricing hold that last star. I will be looking forward to my next cup though and highly recommending you get a shot here after you have paid a bit too much for a dinner elsewhere in the SLS."}
{"text":"latte too much milk -- gotta specify.  high prices abound, just be aware when inebriated! the chocolate twist is very soft with jelly like consistency, bear claw just ok, less flakey"}
{"text":"Stayed at the SLS and loved the convenience of the Perq. I ordered a Salmon Plate ($9.50) and was pleasantly surprised by the portion.  My latte was a little overpriced but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced, if they are trying to be classy it's all pretty average worst then Starbucks and 10x more expensive. I think the only reason people come here is because it's convenient, and there isn't another coffee place close by . Ffs I just spent over $40 on water two average coffees and 2 bites to snack on. Cost $5+ for a 500ml bottle of WATER, I stay at the SLS all the time and honestly very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a mocha and blueberry muffin, which was fast and simple (if a bit pricey - $10 total --- though this is Vegas, I suppose).  All-in-all, no complaints."}
{"text":"Convenient place to grab a quick breakfast.  We wanted breakfast and came down from our room, and The Perq was the first thing we saw. There's also a convenience store nearby that sells bottled water, juices, and snacks, but we wanted real food.  The line was long and we waited for about 20-minutes. We got the Ham & Cheese panini, a cup of coffee, and a croissant. Everything was very good but super overpriced, which wasn't surprising (this shop is SBE-owned and in Vegas, after all). They also have panini ice cream sandwiches, but were $9 a pop, so I passed."}
{"text":"First of all, I dig the name, and the vibe. It is also convenient to have a great coffee place in the hotel, despite the somewhat long wait. The coffee is fantastic, but I wish they had some breakfast options other than buttery pastries... The Bagels were gone by 9:45 am.  I'll probably swing by tomorrow though for my morning coffee."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest pastry brioches I've had and the boozy affogato was addicting. If you are looking for 7-11 prices and Starbucks service, this isn't your coffee shop. You're in a casino hotel and working within a captured audience. So the coffee isn't going to be 99 cents, muffins aren't going to be $1, and they don't sell soft serve ice cream for $2.   But if you want some coffee, a bite to eat, and don't mind paying $4 for something, then you won't be unhappy. I will be coming back for the tasty treats. The affogato was really good and you get a lot of gelato. I'm an ice cream fan so that was perfect."}
{"text":"VERY overpriced coffee, but when you are stuck waiting in line for the Griddle Cafe around the corner it is pretty much your only option.  I'd avoid it if you can, but the service was fast and nice and the coffee itself was good."}
{"text":"A decent quick stop for coffee, pastry or savory quiche.  I saw that they had Acai with granola - I wish I had a chance to try this as I love Acai.  Next time!"}
{"text":"While waiting for a three hour service call for my car, I took the bus to the SLS and was greeted by the Perq right after entering the east doors.  I ordered a large iced coffee but I didn't get any pastries.  I just needed a caffeine jolt.  The drink was served quickly and I was on my way to the casino.  I drank the good coffee quickly.  I'm giving this an A-OK rating because it was but I can't go higher unless I'd try something besides one plain iced coffee.  Convenient location in the SLS and the free wifi was zippy!"}
{"text":"There are so many reasons why this place needs new manager but I won't go there.    Staff: slow, stupid, ignorant, inconsiderate, and inexperienced bunch that they need to be yelled at.    Quality: good thing they are the only coffee place in there because their coffee taste worst than Starbucks. That's really hard to do.    Service: when we ordered our drink two cashiers were just incredible idiots.  If you are in loud place like sls shitty hotel. You need to speak up.  Could not hear. So i told her you need to speak up. She says I have been calling you, you just didn't hear me. (with attitude) Yay for service!  Price: for a hotel who advertise upscale blah blah, it is very expensive compared to its quality  Wait time: ridiculous. The people who ordered iced mocha before us waited 20 minutes to get their drinks. When my wife got hers, she was given another person's order. Same drink but other person's was bigger so my wife said that wasn't hers. Had to check the other orders that came out to find the right drink.  Now I need to tell you how much they clean their equipment if simple grinder can not be cleaned, can you imagine what you are drinking out of?   I am posting a picture so check it out when you get a chance.   If you think these actions are okay by the customers you do not have the right to be one. Most of the people in US would wait for their drinks as if it was normal and it is not a problem, but that is why people take advantage of you like this.  People when you are not happy about something you need to speak up and say \"I am not taking this bs from you\" then complain the f&$@ out."}
{"text":"One must not be separated from coffee too long or things could happen that I'm not responsible for! Great now have coffee and can fire properly. This little cafe is so cute and the turquoise color that they use is so refreshing. Their coffee is pretty amazing too! This cafe is located inside of the SLS just beyond the pool.  The decor of the lobby is so refined looking and with the splashes of turquoise in slight areas it makes the space come alive. The roof of the cafe is decorated with a large round light that provides lighting to the whole space. The chairs in the dining area have that industrial feel since they are all done in silver steel. The chairs sit at white tables that have the same steel base as the chairs. The drop lighting against the glass has that old feel but modern feel and it continues that rugged hard edge industrial feel throughout.   With such upbeat house and trance music some with lyrics and on occasion the music has lyrics,playing this space could double as a night club in the evening. The service here keeps the line moving very fast. The staff are very friendly and trained very well. When it was my turn to go I ordered a small black coffee which was nice and strong! The banana nut muffin was surprisingly sweet but had a great balance to it. The latte I ordered was amazing too. The espresso was strong, probably because I ordered it as a double but small latte. Such a wonderful place to get lost in and then when the coffee kicks in its all go!"}
{"text":"Not really sure why it takes so long to serve the three people in front of me but I felt that 25 minutes for coffee and a brioche was too long to wait. I feel I am fairly patient having once been a barrista.   Also the attitude of the servers and cashier needs improvement. Not happy about life? Rude to customers because...why? You have clean running water, a roof over your head , a car and an education and opportunities galore do you not? What's to be mad or irritated about. Life rocks. Be happy. Smile. Acknowledge people. Dint just keep your head down all day. Look people in the eyes and smile...and mean it.  Good is a term I could use for the Price vs. Quality of the food where price is nearly equal to quality plus or minus depending on the person."}
{"text":"Considering that this is the only coffee shop in the SLS, I can see why they are busy. But taking into account their service, drink quality, and prices, I'd say that there's a real opportunity for a competitor to come in and take their business.  Pros: Cheddar cheese bagel was delicious. Lots of seating. Great music. Coupons for 1/2 off a pastry (when you buy a speciality drink) for those staying at the hotel.  Cons: Service was slow. Not enough people working. Barista was not friendly. Only received one cream cheese for my giant bagel and was told I'd have to get back in a long line and pay 58cents for another one (why not just give me 2 in the first place and charge me for 2, since the bagel is huge!?) My drink (a soy latte with whipped cream) was bitter throughout until I got to the bottom where I found the whipped cream.   Recommendation? Only go if it's your only option. If you can hold out for another 30 mins to get some there else on the strip, I'd suggest doing that."}
{"text":"Great coffee option at the SLS.  There are some good-looking food options, although I've never tried them.  The coffee drinks are great, and I'm particularly a fan of the boozy affogato (coffee w/ gelato w/ alcohol!)"}
{"text":"The Perq is a coffee shop inside SLS Resort and the W hotel in Las Vegas.  The coffee and food is fine. They have non dairy milk but don't use the nice barista-specific milk so it doesn't blend nicely with the coffee.   It is has an open floor concept, meaning it doesn't have a door and walls to the main floor, so it can get pretty loud and disruptive."}
{"text":"I was so grateful to have a solid coffee spot in my hotel.  Their coffee is fantastic, as are their pastries (I recommend the hot breakfast sandwiches & the bear claw) & the service is great.  There's plenty of seating & great ambiance.  I plan to stay at the SLS on my next trip to Vegas & good coffee is a big reason why."}
{"text":"everything was great here, from a-z.   loved my coffee and that's all that mattered to me!  btw, they brew LAMill coffee.  no complaints here!"}
{"text":"The Perq is in the newly opened SLS Hotel and Casino. They are still working out the kinks but what I experienced today was promising.   The baristas are incredibly friendly and helpful, even with the crazy crowd they had to contend with today. The cappuccino is delicious, but the iced coffee with caramel syrup was a little too sweet for my liking.  The prices are not the cheapest but the convenience makes up for it, especially if you are staying or playing in the property.  The only thing that made me impatient is that I ordered the only remaining passion banana croissant in the display case. Being tired (hence the desperate need of caffeine), I just assumed that I will be getting it with my coffees but it turned out that they still have to be prepared in the back. I was perplexed since it was just in the case so why could I not just have that? Ordinarily, I would not mind but if I knew I had to wait, I would have skipped the croissant during this visit. And after 20 minutes of waiting, it turned out that they no longer have it so I had to fall in line again to get a refund.  I am sure that once the kinks have been worked out, I would like them more. But for now, three stars is all I can give them."}
{"text":"This was a perfectly fine option for our $30 breakfast credit each morning (thanks Hilton!) - the first day we had the smoked salmon platter ($9 for salmon, capers, caperberry, sundried tomato, 3 slices of hard boiled egg, and warm pumpernickel toast).  The second day we got a fruit plate ($11 - how this is worth more than the salmon I will never understand),  and an almond croissant/bear claw.  Both days we had juice and tea.  The St. Tropez iced tea was a tropical green and delicious.  I really liked the smoked salmon plate and bear claw.  This place also serves gelato for dessert if you come by at night."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I am giving them an extra star because they offer almond milk for their lattes and also a variety of tea based drinks as an alternative to coffee which is hard to find. However, breakfast on my last morning at SLS was a frustrating experience as the only thing other than sugar-laden baked goods that they had left was a veggie quiche which I waited 20  minutes for and tasted terrible. Most of the waiting I think had to due with the fact that the staff calls out first names when the food is ready and then walk away,  leaving it on the counter, and there happened to be two other Monicas there at the same time as I was (and they apparently move faster than me and also like quiche). Considering how expensive this place is and how crowded and chaotic it is in the morning, they need to step up their service game or come up with a better system."}
{"text":"Meh, I'd arrived at the SLS hotel late in the afternoon and just wanted to grab a sandwich or a snack to hold me over until dinner.  The Perq is a coffee and pastry shop located in the SLS Hotel across from the check in desk.  I was unimpressed by their selection of foods and things to grab on the run, even for a hotel.  I grabbed a strawberry Danish and a Powerade which came to just under $9 which isn't awful considering this is located in a hotel in Vegas.    I also passed by here on my way to the nearby monorail station to try and grab a coffee the next morning, but the line was 1/2 dozen people deep, so I waited and hit a Starbucks and my final destination instead."}
{"text":"The Perq is the way I started every morning during my hotel stay. The cafe opens at 6am and since I'm an early riser, this works perfectly. I'm actually sitting here right now!  Nestled inside the SLS Las Vegas Hotel (North End of Strip), this little quick-serve coffee shop has just about everything you need to kickstart your day.   While I'm not much of a coffee person, with the exception of an occasional double espresso shot, I appreciate The Perq's various coffee preparations (Macchiato, Espresso, Americano, teas and \"special shots) of Godiva, Disaronno, Bailey's, etc), my favorite being the Masala Chai or Green Tea Lattes.  Moderately-priced cafe offering a variety of pastries, baked goods, snacks, bars, prepared breakfast, salad and lunch boxes and even five gelato flavors, if you're in the mood.   For convenience, the quick-serve cooler also offers a variety of beverages such as water, sodas and sports drinks. The best part is the service staff, which are quick, efficient and always happy to assist customers with questions."}
{"text":"My favorite vanilla latte coffe!!!! I stay 3 days in SLS and every day TWICE was stoping for my coffe.... chorizo, egg, cheese burrito is amazing too!!   Great staff  HI!!"}
{"text":"I had the boozy affogato. The cashier recommended chocolate with Godiva. They used two Gelato scoops which is great if you like Gelato. The first spoon was pretty much heaven. When people say chocolate is an aphrodisiac, this product is definitely proof of that. I actually made noise while eating it. I do have criticism of their cup which is too small to spoon from without fear of spills. As time went on I found myself getting quite full as the richness of the Gelato was starting to overpower. Definitely one to share. Also I wish there was a little more espresso and booze in there to balance out the Gelato but this is simply not possible with the cup size.   Overall would get again provided I have someone to split with and justify the price."}
{"text":"Since this is the only coffee shop in the casino you are likely going to end up ordering here if you just want a danish and coffee and not the buffett on weekends or Griddle Cafe.  There is a Mcdonalds and Starbucks within walking distance and an IHOP if willing to walk a couple of blocks toward the stratosphere.  This place is pricey as my ham and cheese croissant was 650 and a regular croissant was 350.  Even in NYC where i live you can get  a better croissant for around 250 at Hot and Crusty.  Neither the ham and cheese or an apple turnover was even heated which alteast would have made this obviously previously frozen pasties edible.  Only reason I ate here twice was with a friend who has gold status at Hilton so had a 15 dollar credit and he was nice enough to share his money with me. I only could find one plug which for a coffee shop in this day and age is a no no.  Only reason gets 2 stars was coffee was not bad and atleast had enough seats."}
{"text":"While staying at SLS my husband and I frequented Perq daily for our Mocha Lattes in the morning and night. Sometimes I switched it up to Earl Gray at night before bed. Service was always friendly and fast! I really do mean fast! Prices were great, not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Only my first night here, and granted this review was based on one visit, but will probably walk the extra steps to Starbucks now.    I was leaving the SLS on the way to work, and there was no line at Perq.  I ordered a large iced coffee with vanilla.  They rang me up ($6...) and I waited for my drink.  It was very rich, strong and bitter.  I asked \"is this iced coffee or iced espresso?\"  The girl behind the counter replied \"Oh yeah, it's iced espresso with water, we're out of iced coffee.\"  I said \"I wish someone had told me that either when I ordered or before you made me something completely different.\"  She asked \"Well then what other beverage would you like, sir?\"  With colleagues waiting for me in the lobby to leave, I did not have time to wait on another drink.  Tried to drink it, but the taste was so bitter I threw it away.  I'm not that picky about my coffee, but for $6, that's kind of bunk service :-/"}
{"text":"Not a bad little coffee shop that's easy and decent. Coffee wasn't bad and the food was tasty. Good to grab for a meal on the run."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the SLS for 3 weekends now and I love the little snacks I get for breakfast at the perq.  I specifically love their strawberry roubar pastry, typically I get a hazelnut latte or regular latte.  The staff are very friendly and the general manager l, Anna-lee is super nice."}
{"text":"Nice little spot with a big selection of coffees and treats. I got the espresso machiato which was extremely strong but it is espresso so I'm not complaining. The down side the cup was super tiny and was $4 i finished it in 3 big gulps. Went there a second time and got the boozy afogado. It was pretty small as well but delicious. I chose vanilla gelato and baileys with coffee. $15 which hurt me just a little nit but I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee place inside the SLS Vegas! Wonderful to have in the lobby since there are no coffee pots in the room, you MUST come here to get some."}
{"text":"As someone who is in Vegas all the time for work, I'm going to give you an insider tip:  you will not find good pastries at any of the French bakeries (Jean-Phillipe, Bouchon, etc).  But you WILL find them at the Perq!  Wonderful croissants that are crisp and right sized, as opposed to the oversized offenses to France you find elsewhere.  The quiche is excellent as well.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When caffeine is a must first thing in the morning it's good to have The Perq.  Located in the main lobby of the SLS resort it's a good spot to head down for that hot cup of java, iced coffee, or bite to eat and bring back up to your room while getting ready in the morning.  You can also get some boozy coffees here!  Fast and friendly service. The iced coffee here is plenty tasty. Some pastries, salads, fruits, gelato and snacks available too. Expect casino prices though. Very convenient and close enough to the elevators. I don't get so many of the bad reviews here. I think some people are just never satisfied with anything and need to get over themselves a bit.  You can also place items bought here on your room charge. So winning when you're hungover and stumble out of your room forgetting to bring your wallet, cash, or even forget to wear pants.  Not that I did that. Maybe......"}
{"text":"Banana Monkey Bread Bear Claw Chocolate Cranberry Scone  Located just past the entrance of the new SLS and slinging LAMill Coffee from 6am until ten o'clock in the evening every day of the week it was largely a result of my early arrival for breakfast at The Griddle Café that brought me to the cusp of The Perq and although I knew the meal to follow was bound to be hearty I simply couldn't resist the combination of warm pastries and welcoming baristas, the results a three part order tasted on site and finished later in the day with across-the-board impressive results.  In some ways a bizarre space with a long bar juxtaposing the coffee counter and several small tables laid out beneath a textured ceiling gleaming with light The Perq concept is one set to evolve with progression of the day and reportedly baking fresh every ninety minutes (or faster as supply demands) with breakfast transitioning to lunch around 11:00am it was to nearly a dozen warm options that I was tempted at 6:15 and although a pair of fruit tarts beckoned along with a truffled Gruyere scone my order eventually settled on items far more sweet, the fresh scone pocketed with spots of sugar and dollops of butter alongside dark chocolate and bursting berries providing a lovely first bite before I delved into a well laminated bearclaw filled with dense yet subtle frangipane that stands tall alongside that of Henderson's Friendly Donuts for best in the city, though the Strip based Casino admittedly commands nearly three times the price.  Indulging last in a selection warmed-and-topped-to-order it was finally in The Perq's caramel topped banana monkey bread that I partook and although rumor has it that lunch fares even better than breakfast with cookies, desserts, and gelato-panini taking center stage I'd be hard pressed to imagine any of them better than the textbook brioche pull-apart studded with caramelized bananas, though I unquestionably plan to return and find out, and next time with a cold-brew in hand."}
{"text":"Friendly and personable staff!  The tasty pastries, well always tasty.  Come one, sugar and dough- who can resist!  The drinks are always steaming, piping hot. Four stars, why- seating. It's not that comfortable!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cup of coffee or tea and they are staffed properly so it was fast too.  There are Muffins and other snacks."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is located in the sls hotel!!! They have a a decent variety of yummy pastries and the coffee was pretty good!! Ordered the iced latte and iced coffee... Mmmmmm!  Fast service and cute tiles!!  Xo,  Naomi"}
{"text":"Came for coffee after a long Vegas night.  I was expecting more, seeing how expensive this place is ($6 for a medium latte....and the guy got it wrong....I wanted a small...but whatever). Over priced. Tasted burned. Most disgusting coffee I've ever had. McDonalds coffee is better than this...don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"This little coffee shop is located inside of the SLS hotel and casino. We swung through here on our way back to the monorail which thankfully has a stop right close by. They have all different types of lattes here, coffee and thankfully also serve almond milk which is a plus for me as it's pretty much the only way I'll order a latte. They also have gelato and they change up the flavors according to the seasons. I went during the fall and they had a pumpkin flavored one that was delicious! Stop by for a sweet treat and get your caffeine buzz on."}
{"text":"Not a great selection of breakfast foods. Just as good as going to an airport starbucks."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Only a few breakfast sandwich options which I didn't see posted anywhere. Fully acknowledge I could have missed them but they should probably be posted more prominently. Lucky us, the cashier was quite friendly and helpful & gave us the low down on the options.  Prices are high, Coffee is hot in addition to good. It's a to go place. Not a ton of grab & go bar options but lots of danishes. They also have smoothies and specialty coffees. Reliable spot and glad it's here if you need a quick bite in order to dash. As with most hotels, the in room coffee just doesn't cut it so this is nice to have.   The warmed up ham & cheese croissant is what we ordered & came exactly as described. It was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Mocha was really good. Pastries were no good at all. Staff isn't very friendly. But I guess this place is good enough to sustain you on your long walks till lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This coffee is terrible. Burnt and acidic. I love coffee and Id like to think I have a thing for it, but really? You can't claim to be the best in vegas and then get whacked in the face with a cup of brown mud water. Actually, that probably would have had more body and depth. And your blueberry muffins made from 3 days ago can take it deep."}
{"text":"Decent quick bite breakfast & coffee option near the front desk at the SLS Las Vegas. A friend got a latte and it was fine, she liked it. I just wanted pastries for breakfast and I opted for the apple turnover. It wasnt that great. The apples were pretty sour and the pastry dough itself left something to be desired. I shoulda went with the almond bear claw. And the prices on the pastries are not cheap as they are the only option of this type inside the SLS. So they def have the market on coffee shop goods. They also have gelato, small snacks and bottled juices & water. Service could have been better as well. It was Sunday am and the line wasnt even that long yet and the cashier couldnt even muster up a smile... I think they could do better all around at Perq."}
{"text":"Tried the iced coffee. Pretty strong. Can't really go wrong with this option. Staff was courteous and prompt."}
{"text":"The cafe is in my hotel - very convenient. I grabbed a pick me up ice coffee and a blueberry muffin.   The muffin was delish! The coffee was also good, i like it black and it wasn't too bitter. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the two mornings I stayed in Vegas and was pretty let down each morning. For myself and my coworker combined breakfast was around 35-50/day. For what we got, the value just want there. The staff works at a glacial pace and they got my poor coworker's order wrong each day! They didn't write the order on each food order so we didn't notice what we had until she bit into it. She's very easy going and didn't complain, but when it happened the second day in a row, it's really disappointing.   Breakfast is pretty much pastries or Mexican breakfast. The Mexican breakfast was mediocre at best and was crazy expensive. Don't make the same mistake we did. Move along and don't give it a second look."}
{"text":"I tried to visit The Perq at 6am when it was advertised to be open. To my dismay, they were not open but still preparing to open. I waited patiently for this place to be open even after 6am but gave up when it was evident that the workers were busy having a drawn out conversation instead of opening. Instead, I went to the Griddle Cafe to get some food and by the time I came back, it was still not open. If the hotel advertises The Perq to be open at 6am, it should be open at 6am.  I wanted to give this place a second chance so I came back another day in the morning. There was a decent size line. Unfortunately, all the croissants and pretty much all the food for that matter was gone. It was definitely slim pickings in terms of pastries. I was disappointed that I didn't get to eat. Instead I had purchased a pumpkin spice latte. It was okay, but would have preferred it from Starbucks across the street. I love the decor and ambiance, but I need some food and also be open when advertised."}
{"text":"Came by for a coffee and pastry before checking out of the hotel.   The Perq is really cute and has that LA hipster feel. The workers are dressed really cute; love the hats!   I had the iced coffee (18 hr cold brew) and the ham & cheese croissant. The coffee was perfect! I didn't need any sugar or milk with it. The croissant was so fresh and flakey!   My only complaint is pricing. It costed me $12 for just these two!"}
{"text":"Hopefully you are only a coffee addict.  After all, you could have the double duty of caffeine addiction and gambling, and that would be awfully bad.  Coming to Perq (I refuse to say the \"the\" in front), is plenty worth the wait.  You see, your kinda held captive, as it's the only offering of coffee in the hotel.  The line on weekends is 10-20 deep on weekends, so there's no quick fix.  A small bakery selection, and all the regular stuff (espresso, lattes), with one special feature, a Liquor Affogato, and I can only imagine what its like.  Cute attire + nice design - no WIFI = 4.0 stars."}
