{"text":"Had burger, fries and milkshake. Milkshakes are to die for! Facility is clean and well kept. Would return!"}
{"text":"Sorry I cant go higher than 3 here. I dont really like the burgers, which is the main event. The fries are a 4 star outta 5 and the Shakes are a 6 star, outta 5. Im not exaggerating. Just WRITING about that PB shake and I want to get one again. Its that good.
I went when it was pretty busy and the line was going quick enough. Definitly worth trying but I think there are better burgers out there.
Again, get a PB shake, its life changing"}
{"text":"Had double truffle burger, garlic Parmesan fries and strawberry banana shake! Hubby loved it, said burger tasted fresh, loved shoestring fries! Me in the other hand liked it but noticed no mushrooms on my burger, I found flavour a bit bland! But maybe my taste buds are damaged?? Fries were just okay!! 
I will say service is good, friendly! Manager came to table, apologized about mushrooms, and offered us a free burger but I declined and was happy with just a side of mushrooms! He was friendly also!!
Prices are reasonable but still not my #1! Maybe my #3!!! Try it let me know what you think, so I can have my taste buds checked if need be!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Price was decent for a burger joint. The milkshake was peters drive in quality. Very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day. The food was pretty good I got the Hawaiian burger with fries. The fries were ok. Not the best I've ever had. Pretty dry. The burger itself was pretty good.

The service, however was horrible! We put in or our order and was asked three times after that what our order was. When the order finally came it was wrong."}
{"text":"Boardwalk Burgers, fries and shakes.  What's the difference between them and the other guys?  First, their beef patties taste fresh and are cooked very well.  The buns have a nice egg wash layer and very moist.  The fries are fried to perfection.  The shake was a bit too sweet (it's milk and ice cream of course) but I think there was too much of the strawberry flavouring.  Other than that everything was great.

A double burger, fries and a milkshake came out to about $16.  You are able to upgrade your combo to a milkshake! If parking is tight there is parallel parking on the south side of the building facing 32nd Ave.

They use peanut oil so those that are allergic, stay away!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten their food, but I've come to get it for my husband. Each time they have been disorganized and slow despite only having a few customers."}
{"text":"It was terrible a waste of my money. The burger I ordered the patty was tasteless. The fries are ok better than the burger. I rather order McDonald's to be honest and I don't even like McDonald's!"}
{"text":"3 stars....thrse are the readons:
1) ok price it's kinda same as fatburger...price wise
2) service.. .very friendly...however...very lack of staff there are steady stream of customer and so they need more people to serve...
3) decor are nice...

Their like Peters drive in...they got double patty. Highly recommended is bacon cheeseburger.

They also have just regular burger which only have 1 Pattie. 

As for topping...they are all inclusive of what u like...they have a long list...

Also what I love is their potatoes are from Alberta.. I guess they get their potatoes locally.

Oh also...you get free peanuts...while waiting for your order...its so fresh it's way better than store bought.

The people are super friendly...i didn't try their shake it's like $5 which is normal price.

They don't have poutine...therfore no gravy for the fries. They do have vinegar.

They also serve it in take out bag so they add on extra fries in the bag so....for a small fries if your petite...you can share.

Being there's only 2 people..i really think they could use 2 more people...1 in the til and 1 cleaning the dining area."}
