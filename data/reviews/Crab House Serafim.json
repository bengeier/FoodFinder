{"text":"This was one of the kindest, most gracious group of chefs and waitstaffs I have ever come across.  Some background, my group and I were 13 college students, and having a hard time finding any place to eat that wouldn't be too expensive.  We looked into several restaurants, including this one, and decided to move on because the prices were too high.  As we were walking away, a waitress came out and told us the chef would be able to prepare a special meal for us, at a reduced cost. We decided to try it, and I'm very happy we did.  We were given a 5 course meal, including a hummus dish, stewed vegetables, lamb kebob, baked cod, and dessert, all for a remarkably fair amount.  We will forever remember the generosity of this restaurant, and are incredibly grateful.  Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"Disorganized!  We ate here on 7/19/15 at brunch time.  Their turkey sandwich had very little meat, a little cheese and was mostly bread.  The waitress mixed up my husband's order with another customer's order.  By the time his omelet arrived, more than 30 minutes late, everyone else in our party was finished eating.  They made no offer to make amends of any kind.  The restaurant feels, and is, disorganized.  The waitress was literally running around and the setting felt very disheveled.
The buffet food was good and reasonably priced at $15.  We all agreed the food tasted fine but we won't be returning due to the chaotic environment."}
{"text":"C'était le pire restaurant de fruit de mer auquel j'ai eu la malchance de goûter dans ma vie. Je suis un très grand fan de resto du genre et on s'entend ce n'est pas très compliqué de cuisiner des fruits de mer puisqu'on a qu'à fait bouillir et respecter les temps de cuisson. Tout était surcuit et l'absence de beurre à l'ail était scandaleux. L'ambiance est très inconfortable dù à l'absence de musique et du décor de très mauvais goût. Ils font un usage abusif de l'aneth dans tous les plats. Le seul point positif du restaurant est leur très bonne sélection de bières. Mon homard était gratiné (bizarre) et surcuit et les légumes d'accompagnement est digne d'une papillote pas très réussit que l'on peu se faire à la maison sur le BBQ."}
{"text":"Very characteristic. Family owned. Small. Slow. But very nice.  One washroom. Food ranges.. Nothing too special . Good portions.  Desserts are ok. Little bit over sauced food"}
