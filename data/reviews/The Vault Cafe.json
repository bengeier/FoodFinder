{"text":"The Vault Cafe is the only commercial source of food where I work. Occasionally I get really tired of the standard PB+J and want something a little different for lunch.  The atmosphere is nothing special, just a fairly small cafeteria which serves a limited menu with a soda fountain and a salad bar. However, your experiences may greatly vary from decent to completely unacceptable.  I went there to get some good coffee one afternoon and I was informed that they didn't have coffee. I pointed out that Coffee was on the very small menu but the woman at the counter said they didn't have it. I eventually bought a bagel, the last thing I'll ever buy there, and it was completely inedible. I could smell it through the plastic. It smelt of mold and old socks and tasted just the same. I've also heard from workmates who have been here that they are charged 1-2 dollars more than what they paid for the day before and when it's pointed out they get the \"Oh sorry!\" then give the correct price.  The only good thing about this place is if you're a fountain soda addict because once you buy a cup you can re-fill it for the rest of the day.  Oh, and they charge .35 for using anything besides cash. If you're really starving and you work in the bank or the other offices around there, buy a coke and nothing else."}
{"text":"Ok, So I read the two reviews and have to admit that is is a bit of a plain jane wrapper. however un like the guy's review from 1-22-14. My experience was packed with surprise and pleasure! Now listen up all you non-believers. I had a fairly easy time finding the place (as I was in the area & googled delis near me), Bldg. C of three building at National Bank of AZ, 24st and Biltmore Circle. parking was not too bad, GR8 little breezy patio w/unbrellas to eat outside, but where the magic really happens is inside! Meet a guy in there who said that they just had the place remodeled, VERY CLEAN, that's huge w/me... he also went on to tell me about their new menu, continuing that he had just taken over as the new manager. menu is outstanding!!!!  way too many delicious sounding choices to pick from. So I chose one of the \"hot off the press\" sandwiches. called The Vault, This thing was huge at $5.50, my opinion way under priced. and big 24oz fountain coke w/free refills all day. I got the combo w/past salad and OMG! nuff said. stopped in a couple of days later and had a 1/4lb all bee natural casing chili dog, on their recommendation. And Im glad I did. This place Rocks! The guy there said that they had a new drink smoothie menu coming out next Monday and I can't wait, as im a smoothie freak! Wish they were open at night. My advice, if your in the area like I was, stop in and try it. I'll BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick sandwich or breakfast bite. This little cafe is tucked in the National Bank of Arizona office buildings and is easy to miss. Now it's not the greatest of ambiance, but the simple menu offers great sandwiches and breakfast items at a reasonable price. My fav is the ABLT sandwich. Great staff."}
