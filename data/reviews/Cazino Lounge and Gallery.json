{"text":"Loved the ambiance very modern with an African twist. Nice layed back music. They have one of the best hookahs in the city. They also have a full bar. I would say this spot is ideal for pre gaming and after hours. I would come here on a date or girls night out. Its really cozy and my fav part is that the prices are reasonable and they have great customer service. they also have appetizers  i would recommend the chicken wings they hit the spot. Absolutely gonna go there again, plan on going to one of their events."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon then drove 25 min. We arrived at 9pm to find the place closed, the website shows they open at 5p, the door says 7p. The outside looks shady anyways, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place as negative 5 I would! Beware of the place people! My cousins and I came to celebrate my sisters bday here and got a whole booth for all of us and our friends OR so we thought .... they ended giving half our booth to another people while we sitting there and they told us that we only bought for half a booth! Which was NOT what they said! After arguing with the manager they refunded the money back but ONLY the booth not the hookah, which was never brought out to us! We never even saw the damn thing and there excuse we that they can't refund hookah once it's been ordered! Stay clear of the place people! There just scammers out of get your money! Also there was a $20 cover fee for everyone that went males/females! That also wasn't refunded to us even though we were there less then a hr!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last nite. I went there for a goth event. Unfortunately there werent a lot of people there when I was there, but that doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the venue. The person I was there with also had to leave early, so maybe more people showed up later on. The people working there seemed nice, and I liked some of the chairs. The second floor is also nice. There is nothing wrong with this place except for some reason, it smelled like the sewer to be honest. That is why I didn't give it five stars. They might wanna do something about that if it is a recurring thing."}
{"text":"Came from Alaska wanting to try the hookah lounge. I found this place and had one of the best experiences ever. The Hookah was made perfectly... and I mean perfectly. The gentlemen who assisted us provided amazing drinks and ensured we had everything we needed.  We will definitely be back to this establishment and I would strongly recommend you give them a try as I can only say it was a great experience!"}
