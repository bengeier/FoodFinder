{"text":"I'll spare you the long winded version.   This restaurant is another product of a bad trend happening in Toronto. A mediocre restaurant that somehow gets great reviews from pretentious rags such as Toronto Life, Globe and Mail, etc. and the virulent contagion spreads to the minds of every subsequent reviewer and patron of said 'trendy' locale.  The food at this restaurant is just OK. It deserves no better than 2/5 stars. My partner and I eat out a lot and this might be the most overhyped restaurant we've tried in the past 24 months. Avoid."}
{"text":"This place really deserves it's reputation. It was my first time and I took my marketing staff for a holiday dinner. It was a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with very well informed staff. The food was excellent.   We shared 3 starters, plus their killer homemade bread. The pecorino sausage was the best dish, followed by the arancini. The tuna was okay, but not was stand out as the others.   For a pasta course we shared had the Orecchiette with squid. I really enjoyed the dish, especially the pasta. The others were not huge fans due to the saltiness of the capers. All the better for me!  For the main we did the ribeye steak. It was perfectly prepared medium rare and seasoned nicely. We also ordered the potato and rapini sides. Was not a big fan of the potato dish.     We certainly over ordered for 3 people but the experience was great. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend and we have been disappointed. We were expecting better for the price. We found the menu choices limited. We had the arancini, the mezzaluna, and the acqua plazza, for about 60$ total. 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered were not really flavorful. The acqua plazza was really good, just a bit too salty. Nothing was bad, we still enjoyed our meals, but it's not worth the price. And to make things a bit worth, we had a quite unfriendly waiter when we arrive."}
{"text":"This place is delicious ! I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday and we started off with some wine and a cheese platter . The cheese was so good and the presentation was on point. I had the yellow beet ravioli ..really good and my boyfriend had the gnocchi also very good. For desert we had the sticky toffee and it was delicious Pleasant experience and our waiter was very friendly and helpful Will be returning"}
{"text":"Best Pasta in Toronto I've had so far.   This is a great date place but they also have a few tables for up to 6 people. There is a private dining room in the basement that seats 8-12 people with the choice of 2 prix fixe dining menus for $45 and $60. They also have a pretty big outdoor patio. I would recommend making reservations.  We made a reservation for 2 on a Friday night and it was about $80 per person for wine, an appetizer, 2 pastas, 2 cappuccinos, and a dessert - it was the wine that made up most of the bill.  Food - 4.5/5 1) Raw beef and roasted bone marrow (appetizer)  - Good for 2 people to share. Chunky beef tartare was perfectly dressed and bone marrow with parsley was buttery. Only comment - although the grilled bread was delicious, it over-powered the taste of the tartare and bone marrow.  2) Smoked Spaghetti with clams and fennel sausage - creamy sauce with a hint of spice - highly recommend if you're looking for a pasta with complex flavours  3) Bucatini All'Amatriciana with guanciale (cured pork) - simple and flavourful - highly recommend if you're looking for authentic, rustic pasta  4) Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream - this came out piping hot with the toffee sauce bubbling underneath the ice cream and over the cake underneath. It was sweet and delicious, but the cake underneath was quite tall so we ended up eating only the top half. I would recommend sharing this among 3 people and cutting through the cake before eating it to let the toffee sauce fall to the bottom.  Service was 5/5 - our server was attentive and friendly.  I highly recommend this place for dinner and will be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Looking inside the place it looks like a can of sardines all packed up on top of each other. You can actually hear the person next to you about their life and smell the perfume their wearing! Also to the owners clean the snow at the side of your place. It's icy and I don't want to fall on my ass. Take a moment and one employe and clean the damn sidewalk please!"}
{"text":"Seriously excellent authentic Italian food. Glad to see Dundas West getting some new excellent spots."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian restaurant in town. Here's why: - they change up their menu seasonally.  - the quality of the food and gastronomic techniques are flawless and exciting.  - their staff is so accommodating - from families with babies to couples on their first date. - It's a bit more posh, but the people inside are sweet and interesting.   I always have an amazing time here and the staff work hard to really give you a full experience from the moment you enter to the time you accept your food comma and order a coffee hehe.  Serious kuddos to you guys! Love this resto."}
{"text":"I didn't make reservations since they didn't have any slots for 6:30pm.  I was advised that they leave about 20 seats open for walk ins so my friend and I decided to give it a shot.  We got there at 6pm and waited for about 30 minutes - not too bad.  We ordered:  Grilled octopus that came with fava beans, potatoes and chili pepper. Loved it, the octopus was perfectly grilled so it was tender and not chewy.   House made manicotto with teleggio, ricotta, kale, shallots and tomato.  This was one huge stuffed baked manicotto.  It was delicious and wasn't greasy/oily.  The kale wasn't overly cooked so added a bit of freshness to the dish that would otherwise be heavy.   Mixed Grill: lamb, quail, capicollo, house made fennel & black pepper sausage.  All the meats were cooked well so none of it was tough though all of it had the same grilled flavour so towards the end I thought it went from great to good.  The sausage had some whole peppercorns so there were certain bites that were way too peppery.   Service was great - our server was attentive, took the time to explain menu items even though the restaurant was full and nice.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"Enoteca Sociale is one of those restaurants that never disappoints. I've taken countless number of friends and family here and everyone loves it.   The service has always been excellent. Servers are well-versed with the menus and wine and helpful at helping you select dishes or wine.   The menu changes seasonally so there's always new food to try but the amazing standbys are always there. Everything I've ever eaten here has been incredible - from the pastas, to the starters and the delicious desserts.    They have a small room downstairs in their wine cellar area that you can reserve for a private party of 8 up to 12 people. There are two seatings - one at 6 and one at 9. I've been twice in this setting and adore it. You can order a family-style tasting menu that's only $60/person and is amazing. Lots of food and selection. It's the best way to eat through the menu in my opinion.   All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time at ES and I enjoyed it.  I don't care for ambiance or decor but it's definitely a warm, cozy spot for a couple's night out and at the same time serves well for a party of 4-8.  The service was prompt, our uneven table was adjusted, new utensils were provided upon request, and we received our food/drinks on time.  The gnocchi was delicious, the tortellini was so-so but the portions are too small for my liking. The price of food is decent but a glass of wine is quite expensive compared to other restaurants.  A good restaurant overall but not great enough to make me a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"I actually want to give Enoteca Sociale a 3.5 star review but bumped it up to a 4 star review since you can't assign half stars and I think it is more worthy of a 4 star review than a 3 star review.  The bread to start was really fresh.  I shared the pork chop and the pasta, pork and peas dish with a friend.  The pork chop was really juicy and the pasta was delicious.  Quality ingredients were used.  I like that our server was patient and willing to explain the menu to us (as we weren't sure what everything was) and was able to make recommendations."}
{"text":"Great place.  The service is really great (attentive, friendly, professional), warm atmosphere, good food, excellent wine selection.  Had the grilled octopus and it wasn't tough at all - it was so tasty.  Trout was really good - nice and moist, polenta was delicious and creamy.  A really nice place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Enoteca Sociale for the past four years of my life and I continue to look forward to having a meal here every time I make a reservation. This is one of my favourite Italian places in Toronto. Enoteca Sociale serves up simple, quality dishes in an unpretentious setting while providing excellent customer service.  The restaurant is a good size with enough tables to accommodate guests with reservations while still having room at the bar for walk ins. The downstairs has a beautiful room for private parties and large groups. As well, the outdoor patio is perfect during the Summer and I would highly recommend trying to snag a seat there!  I can't say enough about how good the food is here. My girlfriend and I have tried nearly the entire menu over our years of coming here and are never disappointed. All of the salads are well portioned and unique from the basics you might find elsewhere. One of our favourites is the grilled caesar salad! If you ever see it on the menu, stop what you are doing and order it, you won't be disappointed.   The pastas are all properly portioned, this is key! If you are looking to get a huge portion of a basic under seasoned pasta, you are probably better off going somewhere else. The Bucatini All'Amatriciana is one of my all time favourite dishes in Toronto. I order this dish on a regular basis here and I am never disappointed. If you go to this restaurant and order one thing, make sure it is the Bucatini, trust me! All of the other pasta dishes are fantastic as well. Fresh, seasonal ingredients combined with simple presentation, can't ask for much more!  The larger dishes are flavourful as well! I would suggest getting the pork dish or the 12oz ribeye. Combining one of those dishes with one of the pasta dishes and sharing everything is usually more than enough!  If you still have room for dessert, don't hesitate to order the sticky toffee pudding!  The service at Enoteca Social is stellar. Everyone is helpful, energetic, and interested in explaining the dishes on the menu. We have never had a problem at this place with service or food quality! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Torontonians wake up. This place comes far short of the ridiculously flattering reviews that it has received. The food is just okay and the interior of the place has as much atmosphere as an Ikea dining hall. This place would never rate in London or New York."}
{"text":"Pasta should be al dente. Always.  If you can't accomplish this with consistency, you are barely better than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is my second time to Enoteca Social, the last time it was for my birthday and this time it was for my birthday as well. Only reason why I came back was the first time was amazing, the waitress was awesome and the menu choices were exceptional.   This review is based on yesterday's dinner on October 8th.   The menu did change and it was my fault that I didn't check it before I made reservations. However the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything to say \"WOW! I want to come back again!!\" Based on yesterday's dinner.   What we ordered and the total:  Appetizers  1. Pear &  Walnut salad  2. Mushroom bruschetta   Entrées 1. Smoked Spaghetti (class, fennel sausage, chili)  2. 9oz Chuck Flat Steak   2x glasses of wine   With tax and tip $150ish   What would have been nice, they could have offered a small dessert for my birthday, I was full so might not have even eaten it but they should have offered. (If the waitress knows how to be a waitress I would have doubled her tip, if you're in the service industry then you should know. Especially when I mentioned it was a birthday)   I'm located at Bay and Bloor so, for someone to come out to Dundas West it wasn't worth it. Much better restaurants that are more central."}
{"text":"So the important part of my message here is that they have the wines on their Enomatic at 1/2 price on Mondays and Tuesdays. As soon as I digested that bit of news (which was about 2 seconds after I read their tweet a few weeks ago), I knew I had to visit immediately and run through their enomatic list. This was a no-brainer, having already placed Enoteca Sociale on my re-visit list. Strong dishes and excellently-priced wines - how can you say no?  I enjoyed the appetizer of Buffalo mozzarella with anchovies and summer tomato quite a bit. But it was the tomato that stole the show. I know that despite how cold I feel now, summer will come around eventually. The tomato, however, made me pine for those hot days with its sweet and intense flavour.  The Bucatini All'Amatriciana is pretty good here and they use the bucatini pasta that I love. And loads of garlic. Good stuff. I thought it perfectly paired with the Monferatto Rosso \"Pin.\"  Recently, I've been on a quest to banish a most terrible memory of scrambled-eggs-with-pasta (not Volo's strongest dish, apparently) and the spaghetti carbonara at Enoteca Sociale most certainly helped. Pancetta, egg, black pepper, and pecorino, in a lovely - and just-creamy - sauce. But it was the large and chewy pancetta nuggets that gave this dish its spark.  The Braised Oxtail and Polenta was very filling. While I didn't love the polenta (not my thing), it did go well with the deliciously thick and rich gravy on the plate. Great winter food.  And we come to my favourite dish so far: the mixed grill. A fantastic and hefty plate of meats: house-made sausage, pork shoulder, grilled short ribs, lamb chop, and skirt steak. All the meats were excellent, but my personal favourite was the pork shoulder. It came sided with these perfect potato wedges, rhubarb chutney, bomba, and a gremolata. You can see the order of roasted root vegetables hanging out in the back. This whole dish was just so, so, so, good. Had the Sagrantino Di Montefalco 2005 with this.  Ricotta Tiramisu. Light and lovely with a cappuccino. A very pleasant end to the evening.  In then end, we managed to sample the entire enomatic list at this casual restaurant filled with families. A lot of fun, good dishes, and good wine.   (x-posted on the blog, w/photos)"}
{"text":"Third experience, but still not satisfied.The first time I came here my Mom ordered a pasta with cream sauce,when we received  the dish there sat a pasta with curdled milk right in front of us.I had ordered a pasta with a cabbage sauce and requested them not to put the cabbage.They served me a KRAFT DINNER style pasta! I was disappointed when I realized this joint had anything to do with the amazing Pizzeria liberetto . If you want good Italian food go to the owners other joint pizzeria libretto home of Neopaultan pizza."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people that makes it a point to jump off the bandwagon when everyone else gets on it. When there's a crowd huddled around admiring an unusual anything, I smirk at their pitiful faces and walk past. So with the hype consistently growing around Enoteca Sociale - as much as I had awaited the opening of this restaurant- I vowed to stay away until the keeners had departed and by god, am I ever thankful they are gone!  After longingly studying the menu everyday for 3 months, I finally paid a visit. The restaurant itself is the furthest thing from pretentious. The decor is simple and homely, no leather, feather etc etc. not even hardwood. The servers are enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The focus here is thankfully on the food.   I was an excited diner, having waited months to order from the cheese cave, to bite into the braised oxtail, and to sip from the enomatic wine selections.  I wasnt adventurous with the cheese so I cant tell you anything you dont already know about an aged gouda. However, the braised oxtail was simply the fattiest, tenderest meat I have eaten in a long long time. The sausage pappardelle was fresh albeit not as seasoned as I would've preferred. A 'just the right temperature' cappucino complimented a soft, pillowy and 'just the right amount of sweet' ricotta tiramisu which put a big glowing red bow on this dinner experience.    I am once again back to studying Enoteca's menu daily and drafting my next visit. Can-not-wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food.. unreal pasta. Try the bucatini."}
{"text":"Had a reservation with Nicole M. and some friends in town from NYC, which had been made about a month prior, for 6 people at 8 pm. Left at 9 pm to go to Union as we had yet to be seated.   Between 8 pm and 9 pm we stood in the \"lobby\" jockeying around in order to let people past to use the restroom (we didn't go to the bar because it was full of people eating, so basically there is no bar). We were given no update about what was going on until 8:20 when one of the members of our party finally asked (despite the fact we were standing no more than 3 feet from the greeter), at which point we were told it shouldn't be more than 20 additional minutes and that it wasn't their fault, but the fault of the diners who were eating too slowly.   Apparently at Enoteca if your table is incredibly delayed it is not attributable to their inability to manage reservations, but instead it is the fault of their paying customers. Enoteca, if you can't work out how to time your reservations, stop taking F'ing reservations!   At 8:50 we were informed that the customers that had the audacity to occupy our table had been asked to leave, at which point we said, \"That's convenient we were just about to tell you the same thing\".   We went to Union on Ossington (which we'd had ample time to call to inquire about availability), which saved our night with great food and better service."}
{"text":"There is nothing negative to say - the service was impeccable. We started with an heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad, which was divine! The pastas and wine pairings were fantastic. Dessert was lovely. This place needs to be on everyone's \"Toronto restaurant bucket list.\""}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food and an incredible wine list. Great atmosphere and very friendly service. There is a suggested wine pairing with each item on the menu. We went with that for our appetizers and our mains and the pairings were excellent. I had the arancini to start and they were incredible (though really, it's hard to go wrong with cheese-filled, breaded and deep-fried risotto balls). My husband had the grilled beef tongue and it was not bad, but a bit too spicy with all the jalapenos on it. I had the bucatini al amatriciana and it was heavenly. As good as what I had in Rome. My husband had the gnocchi, which he said were great (I'm taking his word for it because he wouldn't share!) For dessert we got a cheese plate and it was quite good. There is a better-than-average dessert wine selection, too. The moscato was some of the best I've ever had and we also tried the recioto, which was like a red late harvest. I wanted to write down the names of those two wines so I asked the server to see the menu again, but he did me one better and sent me home with a copy! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I really wish I tried the octopus, but for the two of us, we had a cheese plate with 3 pieces and the albacore tuna starter.  The tuna was amazing, love how the lemon and celery accompanied it.  I had the bucatini and my husband had the pappardelle lamb ragu.    I love home made pasta, but typically I find pasta a bit boring and predictable.  I would however pick this resto over any other in the city if I had company visiting that wanted Italian.  We had the ginger molasses cake to finish and it was ginger molasses cake.  I probably wouldn't bother with dessert again.  I should have had the octopus instead!    Our service was outstanding.  The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and all the wait staff were helping each other out by clearing plates and bringing drinks to the table."}
{"text":"I've visited Enoteca Sociale multiple times.  I'm giving them a 3-star rating overall, because on the occasions where I've veered from the items that I know to be good (great, actually), I've been let down.  The ambiance is lacking, the service generally sucks, and their secondi are thoroughly unimpressive.  My friend tells me they made a delicious panna cotta in the summer with fresh raspberries, but I haven't had the pleasure of trying it yet so I'll believe it when I see it.  They also have a well-priced wine list, which is a definite plus.  If you're in the mood for a 5-star carb-fest, ignore everything the server tells you and order the Grilled Octopus, Swiss Chard, New Potato & Chili Pepper antipasti and follow it with the Bucatini All'Amatriciana.  You will not be disappointed.  Both of these items are outstanding, and the portion sizes are perfect.  The octopus comes in big, hearty, tender chunks and is cooked just right.  The bucatini is a really rustic, al dente pasta dish with the perfect amount of spice.  Make sure you top it with lots of freshly grated cheese.  Enoteca is good, but not great -- unless you order what I have mentioned.  If you want to enjoy your meal there, I strongly urge you to do what I say."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  After having an amazing meal at Enoteca Sociale over a year ago, I felt I was due for another visit. This time around, there were six of us... and let me tell you, it ain't easy getting a weekend reservation at this small restaurant for six people!  What went into my belly:  House Cured & Hand Sliced Tamworth/Berkshire Prosciutto ($12). The prosciutto had been cured in-house for 15 months! Sounds like an awfully long time but it certainly paid off. The prosciutto was delicious and had silky texture to it. If you're a fan of cured meats, this is not to be missed!   Arancini - with mozzarella di bufala and 'nduja ($12). In my opinion, they make the best arancini in the city! Each risotto ball was perfectly crisp on the outside and oozing with cheesy goodness on the inside. Oh, and make sure you get some of the amazing tomato sauce with each bite. Perfection!  Lamb Crudo - with flat bread and house made hot sauce ($14). The crudo tasted quite a bit like beef tartare and didn't have that strong lamb flavour which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preference. It was well seasoned and the hot sauce gave it a nice kick.  Toasted Spaghetti - with bottarga, chili & garlic ($17). It came highly recommended by our server and it certainly lived up to expectations. Everyone at the table loved it.   Linguine - with side striped prawns, fennel and tomato ($21). The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and was lightly coated in sauce. It's not quite as exciting as the toasted spaghetti but it was a simple dish done very well.  \"Hooked\" Lingcod - with linguica sausage, chickpea and tomato broth ($30). It came in the form of a hearty stew. The bite-sized chunks of fish were well cooked and the sausage gave the stew a nice saltiness. Another tasty dish!  PEI 14oz Grass Fed Striploin - with spinach, pine nuts, raisins and mascarpone ($36). The meat had a nice sear on it and was well seasoned. The raisins provided a nice sweetness and the mascarpone gave the dish a bit of creaminess.   Caramelized Banana-Ricotta Parfait - with a chocolate pizzele and walnuts ($10). If you're on the fence about ordering dessert because you're too full, I'd recommend ordering this...you won't feel (too) guilty about eating it! Loved it!  Sticky Toffee Pudding - with cardamom syrup and vanilla bean ice cream ($10). Another killer dessert. I enjoyed the cardamom syrup and could've easily eaten the entire thing myself.  I enjoyed Enoteca Sociale the first time around and the food was just as good as I remembered!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty solid choice if you are into Italian fare. The menu is short but with a little something for all. I went with a part of 4 on a Tuesday night and the place was fairly busy. We had a cheese plate to start, a bottle of red to wash it down and various pasta dishes as mains. The food has a lot of flavour and packs a punch. The wine list is extensive but you had better know your Italian wines to be able to order comfortably.   The waitress was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu, including wine, and was attentive throughout the evening. This is a big plus, I find our great city is not so great in terms of service in a lot of places (maybe all those school kids without adult supervision in a lot of places?). I would recommend this place for those who like a heavier meal with some great vino on the side."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 10 stars if I could. Visiting Toronto this weekend, we had the chance to eat at Enoteca Sociale. We had no particular expectations. The staff was very helpful, provided us with all possible explanations.  Recommendation: Arancini with n'duja carrot and the mezzaluna, burnt walnut pesto & maple syrup and panna cotta  Unfortunately I forgot the name of the market which sells the olive oil served with the bread .... :-("}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and parents, and have to say the environment really contributed to making this place shine! We ordered the pork special, which was a pork tenderloin that we had to share it was so big and it was just soo tender and succulent and tasty. Next time I have a little disposable income to part with, I will definitely go back! Excellent!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading the review in Toronto Life. Called this afternoon for a reservation at 6 pm.  Keep in mind, I am vegetarian and I can only speak to that portion of the menu.  I was quite impressed that I had an ample selection of appetizers and mains to choose from!    The food was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the arancini with arugula and caramelized onions which was comparable to some of the best arancini I have had while in Italy. I also ordered the chick pea fritters on a bed of lentils, almonds and celery.  The bed was quite tasty but I wasn't too impressed by the fritters. We also ordered the ricotta ravioli with garlic pesto and breadcrumbs.  That was a joy as well!  We had the cioccolato doppio semifreddo for dessert which was fanastic.  I really enjoyed the service.  The staff was very helpful while we navigated the menu.  They were indeed very unpretentious as so many reviewers have noted.  The only drawback was that they were a tad too attentive when clearing tables. A few minutes after each dish, our plates were promptly removed.  I couldn't help but wonder if they wanted us out of there..... very un-italian....."}
{"text":"Having been a huge fan of Pizzeria Libretto for a couple of years now, we were excited to give Enoteca Sociale a try.  We went for dinner tonight - it was busy but not full.  Service was professional and attentive, and the food was amazing!  We loved the octopus (super tender), the bucatini, (amazing sauce) papardelle with rabbit, oxtail (polenta was amazing), cornish hen, and the chocolate cake.  The wine list was extensive and the person serving us offered some great suggestions.  We can't wait to go back and sit on the patio!  Enoteca Sociale is a great option if for rustic, Italian comfort food and we will definitely go back regularly!  Btw, they take reservations so if you want are looking for a great restaurant like Pizzeria Libretto but don't want to wait then I would highly recommend Enoteca Sociale."}
{"text":"Either my date stiffed me, or this is the most pretentious overpriced place I've been to. 45 dollars for overpriced, over salted pasta and a glass of red wine? WTF. Her tasting and wine paired prix fix meals seemed like a reasonable deal, but PUH-LEESE...."}
{"text":"Thank you Enoteca Sociale: the hostess was a people pleaser, the service was excellent, the food was delicious, the wine was good and the atmosphere was nice--it was a very pleasurable experience. The perfect place for simple, delicious, traditional Italian food cooked properly.   I tried the enomatic wine but I guess my knowledge of wine isn't enough to let me appreciate a difference--I was just as happy with their regular selection.  And the bill comes with a recipe for one of their dishes!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  My dining partner and I were both charmed by the ambiance, and we each took full advantage of their 2 oz. taster wines--it's such a great way to have a different wine with each course and still be able to go to work the next day.  The food wasn't that impressive, though--I ordered a pasta dish that arrived oily and underseasoned, and my friend's chicken was similarly bland.  We were very impressed with the post-prandial cheese selection, though, and the appetizer we shared was a lovely balance of salty (anchovies), sour (capers), and sweet (buffalo mozzarella).  I'm glad there's a place like this in the neighbourhood, but I think I'll stick to drinks and appetizers here."}
{"text":"Like Jen C. said, try to go Monday or Tuesday to take advantage of the half price wines on the Enomatic.  It's a great chance to be adventurous.  Service was attentive.  Scarily so.  There were times the server swooped in from nowhere, filling our water glasses, our bread basket, taking away our (HEY!  I was not finished!) plates so fast and unexpectedly that I actually jumped and made that embarrassing involuntary squeak more than once.    Downstairs is the famous cheese cave, said to be Toronto's first.  (Spoiler:  it's not really a cave.  It's a white tiled room with a surprisingly small amount of cheese stored in it.)  Also downstairs is a rustic private room with subdued lighting, one long communal table, walls lined with dark wood and wine bottles with a picture window view of the cheese cave.  You can reserve this room for a small party (around fifteen) with no extra charge for the room.  Unfortunately, you have to be quick.  We tried twice and the room was already booked both times.  Finally, the food!  Great bread basket and a truly beautiful olive oil accompanying it.    The Buffalo Mozzarella with Sardine appetizer:  creamy cheese with a slight tang, good balance with the garnishes, but stingy on the sardines.    Their special appetizer for the day, Spaghetti with Meatballs, was a pleasant surprise.  Far from pedestrian, the pasta was perfect, the meatballs were tiny, tasty morsels of goodness and the sauce was amazing in its simplicity and freshness.  The Goat Ragu with Pappardelle:  shards of fragrant meat, rich gravy atop of fresh ribbons of al dente pasta.  Loved it.  The first few bites of the Oxtail with Polenta were blissful...but further in, we missed the necessary acid and textural elements in the dish.  We found the rich meat, the slightly greasy gravy with the mounds of molten polenta incorporating (I can't believe I am saying this!) too much cheese offputingly cloying.  The Zeppole with Salted Caramel and Hazelnuts:  light, sweet, creamy, crunchy and wonderful with coffee.  We definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Despite hearing some negative reviews of Enoteca by Nicole M/JordanT, a friend of mine was eager to try this restaurant, so we made a reseravation for two for 8 p.m.  The restaurant was very busy with a few people waiting with glasses of wine in the lobby, however we were seated immediately.   Since it was gnocchi Thursday, we both wanted to try the special sweet potato gnocchi. We each ordered a bowl and got a warm beet salad to share.The bread, salad and pasta all arrived at the table five minutes later. The sweet potato gnocci was bright orange, and incredibly soft and flavourful. It was served with crispy shallots and a nice portion of buffalo ricotta.The beet salad wasn't as exciting. The beets are served whole on a bed of arugula with balsamic reduction and a dollop of stracciatella cheese. The beets were a bit hard and it was a little difficult to eat.   The portion sizes were a good size for me as I can never finish a large bowl of pasta, but all of their dishes are small plates, so they suggest ordering a few different dishes to share. Overall, I found the pasta fresh and delicious. The servers are fast and attentive, but I did feel a bit rushed. We were in and out within an hour."}
{"text":"From first bite to last, Entoeca Sociale was nothing sort of perfect.   It was by boy's birthday, we reserved the private cheese cave for a party of twelve. We arrived at 9pm, seated around 9:15pm as the party before us was just finishing up.  We preordered two share boards for the table, one cheese, one salumi (both $21). Cheese board featured about 5 different cheeses, for the life of me I can't remember a single name, but all were amazing. The salumi board included a spicy pork salami, mortadella & a creamy, smooth chicken liver mousse with fried sage. Jesus Christ was it good.  Appetizers & mains were ordered. I had the Octopus ($16), Mark had the Smoked Sweetbreads ($16). Both were incredible. The swwetbreads here are by far the best  in Toronto.   For our mains, we both ordered the Salt Cod Ravioli ($17), two jumbo ravioli stuffed with potato and salt cold in a creamy, buttery white sauce with tons of parmesean & capers. Incredible.  Dessert was ordered, Sticky Toffee Pudding ($8) by many. Again, pretty freaking good."}
{"text":"I ordered the escarole salad, nicely flavoured and fresh but they overdid it on the dressing. I also ordered the gnocchi which was great. The pasta was pleasantly soft and the cheese was delicious, almost melt in your mouth. The tomato sauce with it was excellent too, very fresh tasting. My husband ordered the rabbit pasta. He really enjoyed it. The currants and tarragon gave it a slightly sweet taste which added to the dish. He also order the bone marrow which he also enjoyed, a recommended appetizer for meat eaters. Finally, he ordered the striploin steak which was a real disappointment. It was full of gristle and the pesto topping on it overpowered the steaks flavour. This was a huge letdown given that the steak is also the most expensive item on their menu. For desert we ordered a sticky toffee pudding. Sticky toffee pudding is our favourite dessert and we always order it if a restaurant offers it so we have had many experiences with this dessert. We both agreed independently of one another that this was not a sticky toffee pudding. It was a good tasting dessert but it did not taste anything like a true sticky toffee pudding. It had almost no caramel flavour to it, it had hints of cinnamon and nutmeg and even coffee and seemed to be more like a coffee cake, not a caramel pudding cake. So it was a good tasting dessert, but not a sticky toffee pudding.   Atmosphere and decor were pleasant. Staff were pleasant, a little standoffish. However, it was a busy night and we did not get adequate service. It took 30 minutes before we even got our order in. We had to flag a waiter down for every single thing. They never asked us how our food tasted. We even had to ask to bring the pepper and parmesan to the table when our entrees were brought out and the waiter left and never came back. On a Saturday night I would have expected to see their A-game. If this was it, it's not much.   One final note, it is incredibly loud. Not good for a first date or if you want to have a lot of conversation."}
{"text":"I had a couple of days free in Toronto recently and I wanted to visit a number of restaurants and bars with a good selection of local Canadian wines to try by the glass. I quickly generated a shortlist and one of the places that came out near the top was Enoteca Sociale. While they have a focus on Italian wine, at the time they also offered 8 Canadian wines by the glass and the food sounded fantastic.  I arrived around 6pm and although there were already a large number of tables occupied, I was made to feel welcome and this friendly service continued throughout the meal. With the assistance of the waiter, I selected 3 \"taste\" sized pours of both white and red wines.  After complimentary house baked bread, the first dish served with my white wines was a Grilled Ontario yellow perch with wild leeks and romesco. This dish was superb, there was an amazing balance between richness and acid, with a complex nutty character coming from the romesco underneath. This was a star dish, right at the top of the dishes I tried in Toronto.  The next dish was Lobster spaghetti with tomato, chili and basil. Another excellent dish, great flavour impact and perfectly al dente pasta for my taste. The chili is just a background note, which is important as any more and it would be difficult to balance with many wines.  I did expect Enoteca Sociale to be good as I had done my research and the feedback online is very positive, but it exceeded my expectations and I left extremely impressed."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious. Best pasta I have ever had!! I enjoyed every second of eating here! The atmosphere is great; love the patio in the summertime. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"4.5/5! This is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the city! Great wine selection and the pasta is so fresh! I recommend the torchiette if it's still on the menu! Make sure you make a reservation well in advance!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends last weekend and loved it.  Great atmosphere and loved the wine list.  Food was good and server was friendly and knowledgeable.  Go.  Drink lots of wine. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I went to enoteca with my boyfriend on tuesday night to celebrate my promotion at work (yay!).  One of my colleagues recommended the place to me and boy did it not disappoint!  Must tries on the menu: the torchiette, bucatini, and that heavenly sticky toffee pudding - not Italian, I know, but just SO delicious!  From the rustic, kinda romantic decor to the attentive and knowledgeable wait staff to the a-ma-zing food, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I waited way too long to make a visit after being recommended to do so by an established chef. The venue itself has a wonderful charm and it seems to have been curated with this in mind.   The cheese and meat board was incredible and the selection of 3 artisinal cheeses & accompaniments for $21 is a great value.   The Pasta is the best I've had in the city, if not ever. My only regret is that I didn't order the Agnolotti so I had to do with stealing a few pieces from my girlfriend's plate."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday. Was so in the mood for homemade pasta. Though the flavours were seriously delicious, there is something missing when you aren't served a full dish of pasta. I was told the idea is to have the customer experience more variety and appreciate the different...courses. That's a very good idea, but the prices gave no indication as to half size servings. I did enjoy my dining experience, though this is because I did a great job ignoring the pretense that the staff were as rich as their employer must be from obviously scimping on portions. Well to be fair, a couple of them seemed very nice...we had several people serve us. Good wine, good cheese, good luck with the bill."}
{"text":"This is the best italian restaurant in Toronto hands down, stop what you're doing and go eat here. I've been here several times and enjoyed every meal, they're always reinventing their menu which keeps me coming back.  Last time I had the squash ravioli and my friend had the gnocchi con 'nduja, both were so mind-blowing good we could barely talk to each other during the meal.   Try and book a reservation, they keep a communal table for walk-ins but its a pretty tight squeeze."}
{"text":"The service was swift, the decor was lovely, the charcuterie platter was tremendous, and the pasta portions were very tasty but absurdly small given how much we paid. I really wanted to like this place, but it's hard to be satisfied by the deliciousness of the food when you've paid 90 dollars and are still hungry.  When I order tortellini I want a plate full of tortellini, not seven (I counted) individual noodles in broth."}
{"text":"My Dad actually picked this spot as he had read about it in Toronto Life and off we went on Father's Day. We had no reservation so we took a chance and went down right when it opened at 5 PM (and the fact that I had to abandon the family early to catch Digable Planets and Pharcyde at Dundas Square as part of NXNE...bad son..I know). When we got there there was already a line up outside. However when they opened promptly at 5PM we were able to secure an awesome spot on the Patio in the shade.   The patio itself is ace and has two big trees that provide shade. Service was super friendly and throughout the night various people were able to help us with understanding the menus (so much for my family being partially italian).  For an Appetizer we started with: arancini con stracciatella, arugula & caramelized onion; What?? Thats what I said. Its sorta a fried cheese entry with caramelized onion. Amazing!!!!  For my main I had house made ravioli, ricotta, mascarpone, brown butter, pea shoots & breadcrumbs which was very very tasty.  The menu listed different wines to have with your meal but I'm not a wine guy so I went with the Italian beer that they had on tap.  They had a super selction of cheese but I unfortunately didn't get a chance to get into that but wish i had  I finished the night off with a Dolci: sfingi al' enoteca, caramel & lemon curd. This was basically a very spicy cinnamon donut with a lemon dip. I also got to try some of the Tiramisu which was excellent also and I started to wish I had gotten that instead but both were equally as tasty.  How did I remember all this you ask? Well the menu is on their website which is very useful.   Price wise this was a mid-priced night out although I could imagine it could have gotten costly if wine was ordered. Service again was excellent all around and we were out early enough for me to catch the Digable Planets. No. Father and Mother didn't take in the show."}
{"text":"Once again, major points for our hotel concierges for this hidden-away gem. Since it's far from downtown Toronto (by a visitor's standards), we never would have known about it on our own. Only downer for tourists about this place is since it is a bit of a hike from most of the hotels, it's impossible to avoid taking a taxi to and from.   Loved the rustic decor and friendly, knowledgeable servers. We devoured every bite!  Recommended dishes: Cauliflower, olives and almonds Grilled octopus, pepper tuffo and potato Mushroom tortellini, arugula, black pepper and moliterno Half lobster spaghetti, tomato, chili and basil Sticky toffee pudding, cardamom syrup and vanilla bean ice cream  Flourless chocolate mousse cake with spicy almond brittle  Only quibble was that they do not offer tea with dessert (only coffee-based drinks). I was really in an herbal tea mood that evening..."}
{"text":"Really good pasta, fun environment and excellent service.  Will return!  We were 2 people and shared 3 pastas and I am happy we did since they were small portions."}
{"text":"My first experience here was wonderful! My friends and I were getting together for a holiday dinner and they can be quite particular (and not in a 'foodie' way.. Everyone seems to have a list of dislikes and dietary restrictions), so I'm always a little apprehensive about what restaurant I choose. The staff were fantastic and so accommodating considering we were huge pains-in-the-ass. Our food was fantastic, we weren't rushed in anyway, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Thanks Enoteca for a great evening! :)"}
{"text":"Dundas West, the budding street of trendy restaurants is home to Pizza Libretto's owners' newest project - Enoteca Sociale.  While the restaurant is bustling, it remains cozy with checkerboard decals, with no air of pretense and we feel very lucky to get seated right away without having made a reservation.  The menu is nonna inspired with classic comforts of Italy and there are so many choices.  With a description to \"enjoy dinner as you would in Nonna's house, served family style\", we naturally select the reasonable tasting menu at $45and wine pairing for another $22 and we were set! and there's a cheese cave!!! The meal was served with fresh baguette-textured bread and a delicious olive oil for dipping a The pasta is house made and completely delicious! The food on the menu is definitely made for enjoying with wine and vice versa."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit to this restaurant, and every time it was wonderful, but this time around everything was absolutely perfect. The evening started with a friendly, smiling host calling me by my name and discussing with me my favourite item in the menu, which wasn't available that evening, and recommending me an alternative: the home made Squash Agnolotti. Both these, and thea accompanying Barolo were wonderful!! We finished off with a delicious chocolate marquise, and apple ice cream (i did not like that much the ice cream), and the waitress noticed the gift with \"Happy Birthday\" and brought a candle for my friend with the dessert. Altogether a MAGNIFICENT dining experience. I cannot recommend this place enough!."}
{"text":"I attended a private party here a few months ago.  I waited to post a review so as not to upset the organizer of the party.  I have a number of dietary restrictions due to chronic conditions and allergies.  I am not accustomed to having these restrictions met, and I don't expect them to be met either.  If a restaurant can't accomodate me, that's cool; I just don't eat there.  I don't like to make a big fuss or cause problems for the kitchen staff, so I always call ahead to see what's possible before visiting a new restaurant.  I would like to emphasize again that I understand the risks of dining out with allergies, and I also appreciate that I take a risk every time I do.  I would also like to emphasize that I understand that I am probably a huge pain in the ass to cook for, so I don't expect that every restaurant will be able to do so.  But I always call ahead and check, so as not to cause undue stress or inconvenience for the kitchen staff or for my fellow diners.  And I would never go to a resaturant if they said that I couldn't be accomodated expecting accomodations.  Because this was a private function, I contacted the organizer with my concerns, who contacted the staff at Enoteca Sociale a few weeks in advance.  The organizer told me that the staff assured her that it would be fine.  When we arrived and were seated, the waiter asked who had the dietary restrictions.  He then went over the information that I had emailed, double checking that they had everything correct.  I felt pretty optimistic that he was so on top of it.  He then assured me \"Don't worry, you're gonna have lots to eat\".  \"Lots to eat\" turned out to be a teeny salad, a small plate of very basic pasta with tomatoes and garlic (the kind I make at home when I am drunk), and a shot glass of grape sorbet.  Keep in mind that the other members of the party were enjoying a 3-hour, 10 course meal.  I paid the same price as they did, and got 3 miserable courses.    I don't understand why, for example, the kitchen could not have put aside a pile of greens for me before dumping a pile of chicken legs on top for the rest of the party.  Or why it wasn't possible to put some of the olives and preserves from the appetizer tray on another plate that wasn't covered in nuts.    Again, I would like to emphasize that I didn't show up and tell the kitchen my concerns the night of, they knew weeks in advance.  And if it was impossible to accomodate, they should have been upfront about that, and I would have just met up with my friends before or after for drinks instead, no harm done.  I don't expect to be accomodated everywhere, but if you say you can do it, do it properly.    I didn't make a stink the night of, because it wasn't my party, and I didn't want to ruin the evening.  The company and conversation were really lovely, so the evening wasn't a bust.    Enoteca Sociale needs to be upfront about what they can and can't do. This was terrible customer service.  I won't be going back, or recommending this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"First, this is realistically a 4.5/5, but I'm rounding up as this restaurant deserves a better score than what it currently has. I have now been to all three of Rocco Agostino's restaurants (although sadly he closed Silver Spoon down over a year ago) and I have yet to be disappointed.  Second, this is hands down the best casual Italian restaurant I have tried in Toronto (better than Terroni, Buca and Local Kitchen and Wine Bar).   Our table ordered all 5 appetizers for the night without one miss. The octopus was tender and full of flavour with just the right amount of heat; the arancini: perfectly creamy on the outside with a nice crisp exterior; the baccala - just the right amount of saltiness with a strong and spicy tripe sauce packing a further flavour punch. The salad and anchovy sandwich were also winners.  As for the mains: I ordered the gnocchi because I feel it's the ultimate test for an Italian restaurant as a good gnocchi should be pillow soft without the faintest hint of gumminess. These delivered, with the house made bison sausage and sundried olives adding a hefty amount of bold flavour.  Other highlights at the table included the goat ragu tagliatelle and the excellent garum and red-wine marinated flank steak, which was incredibly beefy and seared to a beautiful medium rare; the roasted brussel sprouts they came with were nutty and not even a bit bitter. Probably the weakest main of the bunch was the carbonara, which was a little too eggy and not cheesy enough. In fairness after very recently having the duck tagliatelle at Black Hoof, every creamy and meaty pasta dish will likely pale in comparison.   Desserts were good, if possibly a notch below the mains and apps. Tiramisu was generously sized and very solid. The chocolate budino was rich and had a very interesting flavour profile thanks to the olive oil and salt that was drizzled on top.   Finally, coffee was excellent, which is so often an overlooked part of the meal.  In summary, this place is definitely a must do and I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Of all international wine genres and cuisine types, I looove Italian wines (especially somewhat obscure, high quality kinds, which E.S. is overflowing with) and homestyle rustic fare, and this hits the mark on all fronts.   I had a taster of Lambrusco di Castelvetro with cured BC albacore tuna & heirloom tomato salad, both extremely deelish, followed by Fanti Rosso di Montalcino with a superbly toothsome fettucini cooked with Port-marinated chicken livers, sage and pecorino; then for dessert a Moscato d'Asti from one of my fave Piemontese wineries, La Spinetta.   My date had a really good spaghetti cacio & pepe paired with a Frascati that matched excellently, and we shared a surreal sticky toffee pudding a la mode.   Very kind (almost too kind!) and attentive service to boot makes this experience \"cinque stellas\" for me."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed everything about this restaurant. The drinks, service, food and ambiance were all great. We had Arancini and Romanesco Salad to start, which were both very good. We then had Carbonara pasta, which isn't on the menu but they were kind enough to make, and the Tortellini in Brodo, which was delicious. For dessert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which we both really enjoyed. A really solid meal at a decent value."}
{"text":"Pros: Great Wine  |  Good Cheese  |  Good Appetizers |  Great Pasta  |  Good Service  Cons:  Disappointing Mains  |  Tasting Menu Unavailable  |  Cost Unwarranted  |  Overall Feeling of Something Missing  My second attempt at eating here was a successful one.  The first attempt was a failure of monumental proportions.  With no reservation myself and the person I was with decided that 30 minutes was far too long to wait for a table.  We proceeded to wander along Dundas in both directions, searching for somewhere else to eat, tried Libretto, the place across the street, everything was full.  After 30 minutes of walking (the irony was not lost on us) we ended up at the Lakehouse Restaurant...we were very very sorry.  This time around we had the sense of mind to make reservations for 10:00 pm.  We showed up early and they were able to seat us well ahead of 10, around 9:30 or 9:40 I believe.  The decor is nice and appropriate for the name.  We were disappointed that they had run out of the Tasting Menu which is the main attraction of the place (pairing wine with courses that change on a...monthly basis I believe).    We asked to have a tasting glass of wine paired to each order based on the whim of the server.  We split the Ontario buffalo mozzarella, marinated anchovies, eggplant, caper & black olive appetizer.  I detest anchovies but everything else was very good.  Up until now I had also detested eggplant and the eggplant here actually tasted good to me, a small miracle!  The wine with each course was fantastic but I have no idea what they were, I apologize for being useless on this front.  My dining partner suggested they should provide us with a card or list of the names of wine we had, and that they sell it to their customers.  I agree.  The waiter politely agreed with our suggestion while probably writing us off as crazy people in his head.  Oh yes, the service was excellent, plates were taken away quickly, the next glasses of wine came at the most appropriate times and his pairing choices were great.   We split the spaghetti carbonera that was by far the best part of the night (aside from the company!)  My dining partner had the Cornish Hen and although he never said anything I believe he found it to be good but not great.  I had the braised oxtail and polenta.  I was intentionally stepping out of my comfort zone here so it was not the highlight of my evening.  It was simply not my personal taste, but interesting and fairly good in the end.  If you are a fan of these two things it may even possibly be great.  As a dessert we had the five cheese tasting plate.  It was a nice way to end the night with some interesting selections.  Some were too strong for our liking but refreshing none-the-less.  I initially was going to give Enoteca 4 stars.  On second thought though I must knock off a star.  My dining partner was not even remotely as thrilled with the pairing choices as I was and the price for the quality was not competitive in any way.  Libretto still remains one of my favorite restaurants and I can not see myself forgoing it for Enoteca again if I am in the area.  There are simply too many other choices out there to warrant a return trip even if a number of aspects of the night were great."}
{"text":"Salt. salt. salt. and more expensive salt.  My husband planned a romantic date night here so we could have a much needed night just the two of us without baby. Having read fantastic reviews, we were looking forward to it for weeks. However, we were both extremely disappointed.   We had the special appetizer - pork meatballs with prosciutto broth, beef crudo, gnocchi, rapini and the seafood pasta \"mush\". All of these dishes were completely underwhelming. The pork meatballs were insanely salty, the beef crudo tasted of nothing but salty beets, the gnocchi was bland and the rapini was so salty that we had to send it back for another order. The seafood pasta dish was essentially italian wedding soup with four clams on top. Overall, would definitely not recommend this place to friends. The server was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy, but for a $200 bill, we would have hoped for better food."}
{"text":"I am really trying hard not to give Enoteca a 3 - 3.5. It felt like when people tell you to go see a certain movie because it was sooo good, and when you finally stop being a loser 3 months later and see it, it's just not as good.  I've been waiting to try this place forever and we finally managed to get a reservation at a decent hour on a Friday night (mind you, we made the reservation nearly a month ahead). I was really excited. What a zoo it was! I couldn't believe how jam-packed the place was. Service was wonderful from the second we set foot in the store right to the end.  We tried the grilled octopus and the cauliflower three-ways. Honestly, I was not too impressed. The octopus was indeed cooked very well, but flavour wise? I'm not too sure. I simply wasn't a fan of the cauliflower. I was hoping they could really redeem cauliflower's name from being a second-rate cooking ingredient, but not much success there. The flavour was just not entertaining. It wasn't one of those dishes where you begin thinking about the next bite of it as you enjoy the current bite.  The pastas were redeeming. I got the Bucatini and my date got the Pappardelle. Flavours were excellent and the pasta was cooked well. I really enjoyed the spicy tomato sauce on my bucatini, but what dampened the dish for me was the guanciale. My bad though, I didn't know it would taste so so fatty. Bah.  Highlight of the night was the server's recommendation of wine. It was delicious. I don't think I would return for a while - it wasn't a place to write home about... and my wallet really can't afford.  Atmosphere - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 3.5/5 Price - 2/5"}
{"text":"I moved down the street so decided to finally come here. I don't usually like gnocchi, but this was phenomenal. Probably one of the best Italian places I've ever been. The server was also perfectly attentive and personable."}
{"text":"The service here is top notch, 5/5. They're so on top of their game without being intrusive which I really appreciated.  I started with the Pear and Lonza Salad. Loved the combination of flavours and textures. Definitely a winner in my eyes.  They were very accommodating of my gluten sensitivity. I had the Gnocchi with Straciatella and Nduja. They substituted the Gnocchi with g-free Rotini. While it was good, it wasn't revolutionary. The flavour profile was that of a very fresh tomato sauce with the additions listed above.  My friend who is not gluten sensitive, had their Cauliflower Pasta offering. She said it was okay.   Given my experiences at their sister restaurant Libretto in the past, I think I came in with high expectations. I'd be willing to give it another shot exploring the menu a little more.  As we were leaving for the night we were offered a couple of glasses of Grappa to brave the cold. I thought that was incredibly thoughtful. Didn't take them up on it, but it's those little things that put their service over the top.  Look forward to returning when their menu rotates."}
{"text":"My mom's a sweetheart - a genuine cupcake who goes to great lengths to please. A few years ago she spent some time in the north of Italy cycling the Alps, and was occasionally treated to near miraculous meals cooked by the wives of the local men who lead her and her husband up the switchbacks and through the mountains.   She came home with terrific stories of charming men, too much prosecco, and of groaning boards filled with more food that any one mob could ever hope to eat. Promising my partner and I a meal we would never forget, she set about researching the food of the places she visited, found recipes she believed to be the most authentic versions of a few of her favorite dishes, and made her way to the kitchen.  Problem is, the poor lady can't cook. I mean really can't cook. She once, when my brother and I were teenagers fed us a beef stew to which she added barbecue sauce and a handful, each, of all of the dried \"green spices\" she found in the pantry. I think I still have scars on the roof of my mouth from the sharp stabs of petrified rosemary quills.  Eating at Enoteca Sociale is a bit like eating at my mom's.  There's quite a bit of excitement in the room, and lots of eager diners. The menu reads true to type and all seems well in hand until the food starts to arrive. It's then you realize there are in fact no cooks in the kitchen.  My first course of grilled octopus was so tough, in trying to cut it I very nearly overturned our table. And I'm not talking about a run-of-the-mill kinda chewy octopus type thingy here. I'm talking chip-your-tooth, break-the-knife kind of seriously overcooked and wizened tough. Next came what appeared to be stewed oxtail that regretably, in texture at least, was probably something closer akin to an oxtail flash-fry. Needing hours of slow cooking to break down its connective tissue and tenderize, I, much to my dining partner's embarrassment, picked up one of the damn bones with my fingers and proceeded to gnaw on the thing like an animal in hopes of extracting a morsel of flesh, so under-done was this particular example.  It's never enough, unfortunately, to have good intentions, a trusty recipe, and a keen interest in cooking to feed people well. One must be able to cook. To know that a balance must be struck between charring the octopus, and overcooking it. To know when enough chillies is more than enough in an Amatriciana. To know precisely when meat is about to fall from the bone, and to retrieve it from the pot just moments before this happens.   Thankfully my mom has never asked me to pay for one of her dinners. We have, as a consequence, managed to maintain loving relations. Enoteca Sociale on the other hand, not so much."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant.  The space is small, cozy, and inviting, with rustic wood.  The food was excellent.  The gnocchi melts in your mouth... the tuna appetizer was spicy and tangy... the arancini was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.... all excellent.  The sever (Chris) was a consummate professional, and everything seemed smooth and effortless.   A wonderful dining experience, and I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for a drink and a quick bite after hearing the rave reviews all over town. PR is an incredible thing. We were seated outside at one of their communal tables. Whoever thought that communal tables were a good idea is an idiot. They are only good for packing in more people. I'm 6'3\" and could barely fit my legs under the wobbly table. Thankfully the seats next to us were vacant and I could spread my elbow a little bit. When another couple was seated next to us, they asked to be moved inside because the space was much too small.  The service was attentive if overbearing. Our waitress said that everything we ordered were her favourites. I could hear her say the same thing to the couple at the other end of the communal table, which wasn't difficult to do considering we were a foot and a half apart.  On to the food. The fried zucchini was crispy and mouth-searingly hot. Unfortunately, it lacked flavour. But that's zucchini for you and with no salt on the table, we were stuck with it. The grilled octopus with potatoes and fava beans was much better. I mopped the plate up with my scarpetta (which if you don't know is bread that is...ahh forget it - bad joke). The oxtail and polenta was delicious but, for a main, was incredibly tiny. I had 3 pieces of oxtail on my plate which is enough to feed my cat. Duck liver ravioli with sage butter was a winner, too, but again the portion was minute.  For a place that bills itself as family style Italian, we were surprised that we left hungry. Nona would not be pleased. The food was good but there was no value. I like Libretto better."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last night and it was fabulous! Tried the asparagus salad, arancini, bucatini all'amatrciana and I recommend all 3.  I also tried my family's dishes - the gnocchi and the carrot mezzaluna which I will definitely have to try on my own in the future, very good.  They also surprised me with a free dessert (sticky toffee pudding with ice cream) for the table which was really nice, I thought this only happened at chain restaurants. Recommend sitting on the patio outside as well, nicely shaded by trees so you won't have to sit there squinting."}
{"text":"Went to Enoteca Sociale as a group of 3 couples for dinner on a Thursday evening.  Our server (Chris?) was attentive, friendly, helpful. The service was actually very good and i have zero complaints.  When I called to book a reservation there was only 6pm or 10pm available. Since one couple in our party has a little one we opted for the early timeslot. Traffic at that time is a nightmare and Dundas is under construction, so we arrived almost a half an hour late. I was told on the phone that we would only have a two hour time slot. We went a little over the two hours and no one bothered us, we did not feel rushed along at all.   The SO and I split a couple dishes so we could try a variety.   The Foccacia with olive oil was outstanding. I almost ruined my appetite polishing of several pieces.   Octapus with long beans and mini Potatos This was ok. Not nearly as good as I expected reading reviews here and having our server praise it. Then again, I ADORE Octopus and enjoyed it all over Europe this summer. Not having close proximity to ocean in Toronto, it definitely won't arrive freshly thwacked. That being said, the portion was tiny, and the texture was off (likely from being frozen). The beans and potatoes didn't add anything to the dish for me. I wont order this again.  Arancini con stracciatella with arugala, lamb bacon & caramelized onion. (Little fried rice and cheese balls)  This was a quality dish, tasty. Portion of lamb bacon was so small we nearly missed it. note that it is more like a bacon bit. Regardless, these were good.  beet, arugala, stracciatella & balsamic reduction Decent little beet salad. Nothing special, but nicely prepared beats. The cheese could have been slightly more flavorful.   Gnocchi special with sage butter and squash.  Gnocchi. It looked housemade, and had alot of flavour. Roman Gnocchi is slightly different than conventional \"Italian\" gnocchi. One is made with potato, one with semolina flour. It was decent.  Bonus points for honest wine pairings. Unlike Terroni, when I asked the waiter for a wine recommendation based on the food we chose and my tastes he chose a modestly priced selection. (got a bill at Terroni with a $18 glass on it grr.)   Bonus points that Gnocchi is the special of the day on Thursdays. Thursdays is the traditional Gnocchi day in Rome.  Brought back memories. That was a nice touch.  The decor is really nice. The artwork is great, and they give you a postcard with your bill with a print that matches the art on the walls. Bonus points for the passive aggressive note to the art thief downstairs in the washrooms corridor. \"Nona had to work really hard to afford nice art\" Who steals art from a restaurant?  Basically, the atmosphere was good, the service was good I just wasn't blown away by the food. They have a really cute patio though, and a wide selection of wines and cheeses. For wine and cheese on the patio, I may have given this place 4.5 or even 5 stars. For full on dinner, not so sure.   Good Service, Great Decor/Atmosphere, affordable wines - 3.5"}
{"text":"Came here after reading about it in Toronto Life.  For secondi, I had the chickpea fritter with farro and lentils. I like grains so this was perfect for me.   The white fish was cooked perfectly and slight, delicate flavour.   The ameritriciana, was a small serving, but the pasta was just al dente and the sauce just has the right spicy kick.  For dessert, I had the Italian donut with lemon curd. The sugar-dusted donut was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. I think this should also come with a chocolate dip, in addition to the lemon curd dip.  It's a lovely place...casual, chic with great food. I can't wait to come back and try the rib steak!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute (I especially love the front door!) We shared the pearl and walnut salad, pork belly and rigatoni which were all very good. I would love to host a private party in the wine cellar!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Rocco's. I have eaten in all his restos. From Silver Spoon to Pizza Libretto. Enoteca is an exciting little resto that is comfortable, casual and really accessible. All the food is fresh, hot and delicious.  The service is excellent. You are happy to spend your time and money here. There is a great bar, patio and dining room. It can be really loud in there, so be prepared to have loud conversations."}
{"text":"We had the tuna and the sausage anti pasto: the tuna was my fave. It's nice and tart and has that nice tuna texture.  the sausage was juicy and went well with the garnishes.    The Lamb cavateli, the gnochi, the parmigiana spaghetti and the pasta with chilies.  All four were delicious.  The chili past was mild but if you are sensitive to spice it will may be close to hot. The Lamb pasta was had too many peas in my opinion but was still great. The gnochi were buttery and went really went with the salty tartness of the spaghetti sauce. The parmigiana in the spaghetti was really fantastic.  The service was very welcoming and professional."}
{"text":"just an FYI, when I went they were no longer serving their carpaccio and marrow dish as their guy can't source good marrow anymore. Bummer.   we had a seared tuna app to start and it was great. lots of sweet/citrus flavours  with the tuna. Really good and refreshing.   shared the cacio e pepe pasta and toasted spaghetti, bottarga, chili and garlic. the cacio e pepe was obviously very simple but very wonderful. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. pasta and cheese. so good. the toasted spaghetti was interesting and also wonderful. no complaints on either mains.  dessert: carrot cake with marscapone cheese. it's carrot cake and cheese. What is there to not like? amazing."}
{"text":"My god.  I'll be you are all wondering where I've been for these past three years.    I can tell you that it has been a harrowing experience.  This might take some explaining, so please, forgive the delay in getting to the point.  I have to pour myself a single malt to even begin to start recounting the past three years, I'll try to be brief; something that has never come easily to me, but forgive the digression for this is a tale worth telling!    Now, you know that I have a weakness for two things:  the young women of the world, and the devil's drink.  I also have one hatred:  Communism.  (of course, I'm not much for the modern American system...much prefer the feudalism of my country, but there you go)    I found myself doing some work in the 'former' Soviet Union, and, not convinced that the old commies had really thrown down the old red flag, I thought I would, while there, do some MI6 style work and see if anything could be overthrown, so to speak.  My research brought me to an infamous watering-hole in central Moscow, and while I was attempting to listen in on a conversation of two gentlemen who seemed quite suspicious (and blending in by imbibing in a vodka or two) a young lady took a fancy to an old Brit (me!).  One thing led to another, and it seems that not only did the young lady want to have a financial reward for her 'services' but the two suspected communists were in capitalistic cahoots with her!  A long story short, I was on the run to central Asia, and wound up in a gaol there for stealing a bottle of some god awful spirits and am only getting home now!    Well, stiff upper lip and all, but I'm back.  And I had the loveliest dinner here.  It was much nicer than the last time I was here (before the unpleasantness that had me incarcerated) and I would recommend it for a bit of good food and drink.  The grilled radicchio salad had some fresh cheese on it that was divine, and the pastas were wonderful!  I enjoyed the wine we had that evening, and it brought back memories of London, and the cases of wine from southern Europe that we had in our cellar, and the superb service reminded me of the Footmen and Valets who would server us!  Bravo!  Well done!   Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner last night! Walked in without resos and within 5-10mins, we were seated at the bar.   Very nice, casual vibe paired with servers who could double as sommeliers.  Ordered the arancini.... So delicious and home-y...comfort food done incredibly well! The octopus was out of this world!  Tender, moist well-seasoned served with lemon-infused potatoes and red pepper purée.  Should have ordered seconds! For mains, we ordered the lamb ragu on parpardelle and the rutabaga mezzaluna with brown maple butter and pickled *i think* black truffle mushrooms.  The mezzaluna was the perfect combo of savory and sweet (still dreamin of that flavor combo) while the lamb ragu was OK.... Leave it at that!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night after a friend recommended this place to me.  SO glad I went! Everything I ordered was delicious. I loved the arancini and cheese platter as the appetizers. The gnocchi was good but the rigatoni pasta dish was my favourite ; made me want to order another! And of course I had to get the sticky toffee pudding at the end of which was very delicious.  The service was good and I liked the rustic, casual atmosphere. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Truly wonderful meal here - great room, great energy, great service, great food. Really a home run.   To start - the bread is amazing - they serve this focaccia that is off the charts.   Then, ordered a cheese selection, which was well curated and accompanied by all sorts of goodies. Next, arancini, which were crisp, packed with cheesy flavour and happiness, surrounded by baked tomatoes.  Just wonderful.   Both wife's pasta and mine were terrific - perfectly cooked, wonderful flavour, but the best was saved for dessert.   The sticky toffee pudding is perhaps the best dessert of the year. Truly off the charts.   Overall, highly recommended restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to Enoteca a few times now and IT HAS BEEN AMAZING every time. Fantastic service, great food, wonderful ambiance. It is one of those classic go to restos for when you just want a guaranteed awesome meal.  Menu must haves: Arrancini - deep friend risotto and ricotta balls Grilled octopus Spaghetti pepe - delicious!! And of course, a cheese plate for dessert.  Hmmmm.. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The only comment I have about this place is the waiter who was the bartender was very friendly and helpful, however, he is also very talkative and it took about 5-6 minutes for him to move off a discussion with another patron down the bar and notice me.  Outside of that the food is awesome!  I don't think I ever tasted pasta that good before!  I would come back if I lived in the area for sure."}
{"text":"I was with Jordan T. for the 1 star experience he describes below.   Mistakes and delays can happen. I can understand that. The experience was frustrating for a number of reasons, mainly Enoteca's failure to accept responsibility for the delay (they repeatedly told us it was the fault of the people still at our table). They treated us like they were doing us a favour by accommodating us over an hour after our reservation.   In fairness, Enoteca sent out some prosecco (at about the 25 minute mark) and an appetizer (at about the 50 minute mark). It was a nice gesture and the appetizer was actually quite good - but the overall experience left a sour taste in my mouth. We left shortly after 9pm."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. Expected more variety on the menu. It's not your run of the mill Italian restaurant.  The mushroom bruschetta was tasty. We found that the pastas (fregola and rigatoni) were way too salty for our tastes. I was really anticipating eating my Fregola pasta but was really disappointed. It contained a total of 3 miniature clams and 3 mini scallops. Dont expect to leave there stuffed because you wont be. The pasta portions are really small. The service was good however I would recommend that they wait for diners to be completely finished before they take away the plates. Would I go there again? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Enoteca - you've changed. I went for dinner after not coming since perhaps last spring? And a lot has changed - including the crazy, distracting interior.   Their wine list is still fantastic however, there were no real main dishes offered, the pastas this time around were just 'okay'. I had the linguini with clams - very oil heavy, a friend had the gnocchi - way too soft, and our boyfriends both has the rigatoni ragu - the best dish of the lot but still not 'old enoteca, awesome'.   There must be a new chef cooking. And its not the same. Will be finding a new favourite. Sorry guys, but what a disappointment."}
{"text":"ENOTECA, more like ENOMECCA!  Ahem (cough)  Excuse me waiter where are you going with that plate? There's a potato left and I'm not finished - thank you!"}
{"text":"About a month ago we ate on the patio of Enoteca and loved it. Although we had to wait about an hour or so (we did a walk-in) we live close by so went home and waited until we go the call. The staff were very friendly and almost all the dishes were cooked so well. There was a boconccini dish that I still think about, because that cheese is mostly like styrofoam at other restaurants. Definitely need to go back and try the full cheese plate."}
{"text":"What is all the hype about?  The $34 sea bass was served on a bare plate.  Much of the outside was burnt (too much charing) and the inside was moist in some spots quite dry in others.  The seasoning was plain.  I feel it is taking advantage of a customer to serve this quality of food.  My friend's pasta was not that great either.  On a bright note, the bread was very good."}
{"text":"Eno was fantastic last night.   Sat at the bar - and after a few weeks, the servers were now all on their A-game. Attentive and knew what they were talking about.    Had: -The pear salad. A1 (perfect to accompany the OMG baked foccacia http://www.yelp.ca/biz/omg-baked-goodness-ltd-toronto and the olearia san giogio olive oil....go buy some from blue banana http://www.yelp.ca/biz/blue-banana-market-toronto).  -The spicy tomato pasta plate with pork cheeks. Perfect amount of spice. -Cornish hen - this was my favorite part of the last time I went...still excellent. -Trout with fennel salad and grilled fennel (this grilled fennel was soft and perfectly cooked. Delicious.)  -2008 Norman Hardie Chardonnay - which was a good pairing with the fish and hen. It's very good - a smoky aroma. I'd say go with the reisling also on the menu and save yourself $20.   I was really craving a  vanilla afogato like you get at Libretto...but managed to tide me over with a fried zeppola and cream with an espresso on the side. Loved it.  The manager dude who looks like Rocco was especially good at his job.   The only caveat of the night - is when you don't have a reservation you may be stuck to sitting at communal tables (EW). There were a few tables set aside for reservations that were left unfilled the entire time we were there - sort of annoying in principle- although if you grab the end of the bar, it's almost better because you're top of mind with servers and a little more space for all those plates."}
{"text":"Came here without a reso on a snowy Saturday night. The GM was nice enough to save us a couple seats at the bar while we found a parking spot (not an easy task) When we finally made to the restaurant we were pleasantly surprise to find that a table had become available =) The restaurant was full and the ambiance was lively but still intimate. We started off with a Quartino of the Valpolicella Classico. For our Platti Sociale (dishes to share) we had the Pears and Lonza as well as the housemade sausage.Pears are always a fave of mine and the dressing was to die for. The sausage was served with a pesto sauce that was creamy and  just perfection. For our pastas I ordered the Ricotta Tortellini, the portion was generous, the pasta seemed fresh like made in house. My bf ordered the Bucatini which was a bit too garlicky for my taste. We shared the sticky toffee pudding which was rich and decadent hmm yumm. The service was great; attentive but not intrusive.  Karen gave us great recommendation for our apps and mains. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was good - friendly staff. Ambiance was cozy. Would come back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gnocchi was fresh and smooth.  Few options have vege choices. Lovely olive oil and wine selection.  Perfect for a evening of good pasta."}
{"text":"Great service and really nice atmosphere. The bread was tasty and fresh. I had the spaghetti which was simple and one of the best I've had in the city. Really great experience overall."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here this week.   We had the arancini to start - this was excellent, The only mis-step here is that the waiter took away the bowl containing the delicious sauce before we had a chance to object!  Otherwise excellent.   Bread was delicious and plentiful, as was the accompanying olive oil.  My fella had the Rigatoni with Bolognese which was exceptional and I had the Spaghetti with sheep's milk cheese & black pepper. We shared both dishes and it was a great contrast.   The pasta was excellent and the portions were perfect.   We shared a tiramisu (which was really lovely) and my fella's espresso was good.   That and a carafe of Red brought the total bill to just under than $85 including tax.  Overall a lovely place to spend an evening and a well thought out menu...and lots of good bread.   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice. The first time around was a blast. The food was amazing and I loved the charcuterie board. Because of my first experience I decided to go back a second time (this time for a special occasion) expecting the same level of quality. Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed. The menu has changed and it did not change for the better. Nothing on the menu was attractive and was rather simple ingredients. The menu was on the heavy side for the pallet. It was oily and salty.   The service was mediocre. Nothing special. It is a little perplexing that I can have such a difference in opinion from my first to second visit. It just tells me that they are not consistent with the quality. I'll most likely pick another restaurant over this."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Monday in July at 8:00. It was busy, but not packed. The table of 4 next to us were loud, and our tables were really close together (I could barely fit between the two to get to the washroom) so it was distracting, but they left shortly after we arrived so no biggie. All in all we had an incredible experience. It was the best restaurant food I'd had in a VERY long time. It was like somebody's nonna was in the back whipping things up. Everything we ordered was awesome.   My first complaint: We got there 5 minutes early for our reso but were seated right away, which was great. We glanced at the menu, asked for a few clarifications then ordered cocktails and starters. We got our cocktails within 5 minutes, awesome, but we got our starters about a minute after that. If I want a negroni (which was delicious, BTW), I want at least 5-10 min to savour it before food arrives. Instead, I had 2 minutes before the carpaccio arrived. For the record: carpaccio and negronis are not a match made in heaven. Less than 2 min after that, a server showed up with the enoticated (or whatever it's called)  wine we ordered. Sensory overload. I would have preferred to be able to sip my cocktail before the appy and wine arrived. Nonetheless, rather than gulping I set my negroni aside. The beef carpaccio was exquisite. I'm not a huge carpaccio fan but I'd order this any day. The shaved blanched asparagus sprinkled with cheese that came with it was divine. A few minutes later, our sausage with hot peppers, asparagus and cheese arrived and was equally delectable. Both apps went incredibly well with the wine the server recommended and not even the tiniest morsel remained by the time they took the dish away.   For mains, my boyfriend got a rigatoni with pork sausage and I got the gnocchi with tomato sauce, stracciatella and sausage. Both were to die for. Wine went perfectly with both as well. With two apps and two mains, we were neither too full nor too hungry. I would definitely go back again. Hopefully next time they'll give us more time to enjoy our cocktail before bringing wine and apps. Prices were not unreasonable for the quality of the food and the wine list was totally decent in terms of affordable and worthwhile options.   My only other complaint was with the washrooms. Why oh why do so many nicer restaurants in this city put so little effort and attention into washrooms?? This one was TINY, and there were only two cramped stalls and a tight squeeze at the sink for a relatively large dining room. The rentable cellar room next to it looked awesome so I guess they wanted to use basement real estate for that, but come on! This is in no way unique to Enoteca, just a complaint I have with many restaurants in this city.  All in all, I would say this a must try, and I`ll definitely be back, for the quality of the food, the wine and the overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"When we ate: 7 pm Where we ate: At the bar (walk-in) What we ate: Arancini to start, Gnocchi and Linguine with Prawns. What we spent: $120 including tip, and a bottle of wine.  Our server was attentive and very helpful in explaining some of the dishes. The pasta was some of the best we'd ever had and was clearly prepared with care.  It's really catering to a different type of dinner crowd than what you typically see around Ossington and Dundas on a Friday night. It's a great time, but it's a destination rather than dinner-before-night-out type place."}
{"text":"Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 8.5/10  As you've probably read in most of the other reviews, the food here is top notch. Seriously excellent Italian grub, and the kind of menu where you could order anything and almost be guaranteed to like it.   We sat on the patio when we came, which was really nice. I admit that the inside is a bit dark for my liking (get your phone light ready to read the menu), but it definitely is atmospheric.   Service is good. The staff are polite and friendly.  ORDERING TIP: my two recos would be the arancini (risotto balls) and charcuterie board (pate is to-die for).  THE BOTTOM LINE: incredible Italian food that will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious Pasta and great wine!  Try Lambrusco red wine."}
{"text":"I only had the mushroom pasta and I loved it =) Would come back again to try something else."}
{"text":"I went to Enoteca last night for an impromptu dinner with friends; likely we were able to get a table of 4 without waiting.    Their menu has completely changed from the last time I was there back almost a year ago; side dishes are no longer being offered.  The aranci balls are still on the menu and they were fabulous!  Things took a dip for our pasta entrees, the portion sizes were REALLY small; like REALLY small.  I was expecting a full meal but I was left slightly hungry for dessert.  The sticky toffee pudding was amazing, the highlight of the meal!  Service was excellent, that has not changed.  Bring back the bigger portions and all will be right in the world."}
{"text":"I have been excited to eat here forever! I just got home from dinner and I'm still completely stuffed and smiling.  Firstly, it's Easter Monday and the place was packed.  By the time we got there, there was still a wait for walk-in seating at the bar.  The bar was fun though, because we got to chat with their awesome bartenders.  Fantastic knowledgeable staff.  Enoteca Sociale has an incredible wine selection.   They have quartino servings of some wines available, but I wish we had just gotten the next size up which is a bottle. :P  The servers were really good with recommendations and offering us tastes and they didn't make you feel silly for asking all kinds of questions.  For an appetizer, the special was the raw sea bream with olive oil and fennel.  The fish was super fresh and springy.  But, I wish it was a bit more acidic.  This dish was a tad bit boring.  The pastas here are all made in-house.  Apparently, the chefs went out looking for leeks.  The mushroom tortellini ($22) was highly recommended, so I gave it a shot.    It was super delicious.  It didn't seem like a large portion, but I was pretty full after (I also scarfed down half a basket of fresh bread).  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the stuffed with mushrooms and truffled cheese (droolface).  It was really melt-in your mouth awesomeness.  I tried to chew slowly.  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate mousse cake ($10).  It was a sizeable portion and super chocolatey, light, and not too sweet.  The interesting part of the dessert was the spicy almond brittle sandwiched in the middle.  It added texture and it really had a kick!    There are a few items that I really want to come back and try: * Cheese platter * Arancini  * Baked kale salad with oyster mushrooms and apples * I wish I could eat a 20 oz steak without entering a meat induced coma  Enoteca Sociale was fantastic.  However, I can't say it's my favourite Italian resto in the city,  but definitely close to the top of the list."}
{"text":"This four year staple in Toronto Italian has lost nothing over the years.  Service = 10 + Food = 10 + Ambiance =10 + QPV = 10.  Full score."}
{"text":"Came here because they served my favorite clam pasta dish and also due to Yelp review.  Let me tell you, it absolutely did not disappoint! The starters were amazing, used great olive oil; mains were good as well. However, what I'm most impressed about is the service. When we came in, there was no reception as I think she was seating someone, the bartender saw us and immediately came and attended to us. They constantly filled out water without asking and changed our plates after appetizer. Staff seem very knowledgable about their food and the atmosphere was amazing!!! Will absolutely recommend this place. Bone marrow / tatare was amazing :)"}
{"text":"After reading reviews of others, I was eager to try Enoteca. At long last we finally made it there. For our first time, we settled on appetizers. In total, we sampled six. My favorite is definitely tuna with heirloom tomatoes. The sweetness of tomatoes perfectly compliments smoked salty tuna. Other appetizers were equally impressive. The service was extraordinary. Our server was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about wines. Although the menu already contains the food and wine pairing, she took the time to take us through the wine list and make a suggestion that would satisfy variety of foods we ordered. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I wish Enoteca Sociale was right on the subway line.  Although the steady stream of oncoming diners can attest that this place is doing just fine, despite the necessary streetcar trek.   A modestly sized Italian resto, it's got that dim interior that's cool yet has booth seating and friendly service that's also welcoming to families.  The service was really nice and polite, winning points with my mom and dad.   After attending my brother's convocation, my family and our significant others were looking for an early dinner with reasonably accessible parking, little to no wait time (best to call ahead and ask if a table is available before you go), comfortable seating, and a midrange price for a group of 6.    The menu, though relatively small, was perfect for us.  Ordering plates to share, here's what we got:  - Albacore Tuna Conserva, $14 - Taggiasche olives, red onion & mint.  This was prepared sous-vide, only just cooked through, drizzled with plenty of olive oil over pitted olives, thin red onion slivers, and small mint leaves.  I dipped my bread in it afterwards.   - Raw beef & bone marrow, $15 - Gremolata & grilled sourdough. Two of my much-loved dishes on one plate?  How can this be?!  This was a popular one with our group and was demolished the quickest.  The beef tartare is cut relatively thick, in case you're wondering.  The bone marrow is half a bone, so I would think that one person could easily polish off one order.   - Grilled Sausage, $15 - Grilled ramps, shallot salsa, herbed ricotta & honey. A hit for my carnivorous dad, he enjoyed the shallot salsa combo.   -  Bucatini All'Amatriciana, $13 - Guanciale, tomato & chili.  If you have yet to try bucatini, I would describe this as a slightly thicker, hollowed-out spaghetti.  The guanciale is cut into small bits. The tomato sauce is mostly absorbed into the pasta, creating a red-hued noodle.   - Rigatoni, 16 - Braised rabbit, pine nuts & currants.  The rabbit meat is shredded into chicken-like pieces and had no real discernible game taste.  A safe and inoffensive segueway into game meats if you've never tried it before.   - Smoked Spaghetti, $17 - Manila clams, fennel sausage, chili & parsley.  I hope this wasn't the spaghetti Eminem was talking about, because that would be a pretty big waste (\"There's vomit on his sweater already/Mom's spaghetti\")!  Another hit of the night.  The fair portion of plump clams nicely filled their shells, which I think helped to justify the price.  After eating the first round of it, we actually immediately ordered a second!   8OZ 45 Day Dry-Aged Ontario Striploin, $34 - Arugula, salsa verde & lemon.  I found this one actually a bit overpriced, but hey, the cost of meat isn't cheap, especially for quality.  12oz Heritage Pork Chop, $28 - Braised dandelion greens & cipollini agridolce.  Best eaten with an appropriate dab of cipollini on top.   Rapini, $7 - Lemon, chili & pecorino.  It's listed as a side dish, but it's actually a pretty large serving presented on its own separate plate. If you haven't tried rapini before, you should probably be warned that it's a bit on the bitter side.  Yikes, autocorrect tried to write \"If you've never tried raping before...\"!!   Rest assured, no rapists on the menu - just rustic, comfort fare that will leave you warm and satisfied."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed everything I've tried here. Loved the sweetbreads, arancini, stuffed zucchini flowers, ravioli and seafood pasta. The portions are small so appetizers are highly recommended to accompany your entrees. The price is reflective of the quality of the food. They have a lovely patio but tables are very closely situated so private conversations are impossible."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner.  We got the Trout Crudo to start.  It was a refreshing and balanced appetizer.  The salty fennel slivers were a perfect compliment to the trout.   I got the Gnocchi for my main and my friend got the Cappellacci, the salt cod with pasta.  My Gnocchi was a comforting dish with a nice kick from the chilli and smoked ricotta.  It was one of those dishes that you can just keeping eating on and on. My friend's salt cod was definitely something out of the ordinary but not my favorite, I preferred my dish.  The  waiter was personable and the service was good."}
{"text":"One of the most pleasant meals I have had in a while.  The food was great and the staff were amazing.  They recommended wines and pairings to go with and between every course.   Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Did a business dinner here in the private cellar. Prix fix menu. Terrific food and service; worked exceptionally well for a group of 12. Menu consisted of: antipasto cured meats, fresh bread, tuna salad, Romanesco and radicchio salad, sausage bake, trout, chicken and sausage stuffed chicken, beef, several pasta dishes... and ice cream topped brownie cake. All wines done up to match.  Wonderful meal and selection. Everyone had a great time. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I've been impressed by the service and the food every time I come here for dinner. I've had two meals in the private room downstairs, which were excellent (and a fantastic way to have a small celebration). And the meals I've had (two or three now) in the main restaurant were excellent too.  Yesterday I called in to order the tuna conserva for pickup. I mentioned in passing, because I felt a bit strange about just ordering an app for pickup, that it was my husband's birthday and that while he wanted to have dinner at home I knew he'd be super happy to have the tuna (and I certainly wasn't going to sous vide tuna to make a version of their amazing conserva at home - I was drawing the line at homemade sweet potato gnocchi). I opened up the package later to find a serving of chocolate terrine with 'Happy Birthday' written on the container. And a portion of their delicious bread with oil for dipping. I meant to call last night because it was such a nice surprise but forgot - so I've rallied to write a (long overdue) review. Thank you Enoteca!"}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by stating how I consider myself a foodie. I'm a frequent yelp user when it comes to reading reviews in particular cuisines to narrow down my options. Although this is my first yelp review, when it comes to Italian cuisine I strongly do not recommend this franchise. Anyone that wants quality Italian dishes should not come here. Although the staff is friendly and knowledgable, the food quality is atrosous. Both pasta dishes my partner and I ordered were extremely salty and inedible. I could go into further detail, but rather not. Moral of the story, save your time and money. This should not be part of blogto's top 10."}
{"text":"The wait staff is simply phenomenal. I've eaten at my fair share of restaurants and have seldom received such stellar service. Every member of their team is focused on being meticulous in their tasks, while maintaining a pleasant atmosphere.  Having never eaten at Enoteca, I relied on my server and he didn't disappoint in his suggestions. From the 'piatti sociale' (social dishes) our party of four went with the grilled squid dish, the cauliflower dish and the kale dish. I generally don't go out of my way to eat the latter two vegetables, but they were prepared in very interesting ways and tasted wonderful. You WILL NOT be disappointed with the cauliflower dish. I don't care who you are and how much you hate that vegetable.  As far as the main courses, of the four dishes I tried, I would say I enjoyed the rutabaga agnolotti & lemon maple butter, as well as the simple-but-delicious spaghetti cacio e pepe.  For those that are fine with smaller portions, you'll be just fine. If you're an animal you will likely be disappointed, although to not eat here would be to deprive yourself of the wonderful food.  There is a fly in the ointment and that is the cold air that blew into the restaurant all night. It made it a bit uncomfortable at times. Hopefully they will come up with more permanent solution than a set of heavy drapes to separate the lobby from the dining area. Either way, if you make a reservation, you may want to insist on a table closer to the rear."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal!  the menu was short and brilliant.  The desserts were crazy awesome.  The staff was great.....with one hiccup.  Not so funny when asked for wifi password to be told \"get a better data plan\".  I'm sure he meant no malice, but maybe check your comedy before dropping something like that.  I later thanked him for saving us international data roaming charges.  Make sure you get here while in Toronto."}
{"text":"Second time here. I have to agree with many other reviewers, many of the dishes are heinously over-salted (seems to be very much a Toronto thing). The worst was the chicken in this regard. Squid ink pasta was also too salty and lacked any other discernible tastes.  On the plus side I found the dandelion salad delicious with the greens refreshingly bitter (one of the flavours that doesn't get its due), complemented nicely by a delicious dressing. The olive oil served with the bread was very vegetal and fresh tasting. The \"summer fling\" cocktail was refreshing and strong.  Service was friendly but there were long gaps when we weren't attended to. Wasn't exactly cheap either for simple pasta and chicken ($120+ for 2) but hey Toronto is one of the priciest cities out there for dining out especially if you want a drink or 2. High rent, labor and taxes does that to you and based on that ES wasn't anything out of the ordinary.   Had a better experience first time around, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us went there last night and I have to say I was disappointed. We started off with the tuna, octopus and the kale salad. The octopus was byfar the best but not work the $19. I got the bucatini all'amatriciana which was ok but boring. My husband got the Steak($49) and found it fatty and chewy.   Also when asking our server for recommendations he made not eye contact and listed the most expensive things on the menu and mentioned we should all get an appy's because the entrees were not that big. I feel like our server just wanted a bigger bill for a bigger tip.  All and all not a great meal. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, service is good, and waiters are knoledgeble. Both pasta and their meets are very good. The charcuterie plate is so-so. Food is a bit salty. Overall great experience. Book at least 2 weeks in advance."}
{"text":"What does one do when one ventures into unfamiliar neighborhood and sees a restaurant  that is mentioned around quite a bit, well one walks in and asks for a table of course. So on a rainy Sunday night  after a social event we ended up at this spot. The place was packed and the 4 of us ended up sitting at the communal table with 2 other diners. Two of the fellow diners decided to stick with the dessert a wise choice (more on this later) I was feeling a bit adventurous since I didn't have to share my food with anyone else so I decided to order items that are not that common elsewhere GRILLED BEEF TONGUE, PEACH & JALAPENO, SALSA VERDE and \"CROWN SALUMI\" and a BEEF CARPACCIO, BONE MARROW, SUNCHOKE CHIPS & ARUGULA and asked for the glass of red to go with the meal. The last fellow diner ordered GNOCCHI, TOMATO,'NDUJA, STRACCIATELLA & BASIL Service was nice even though the place was packed. Warm bread was brought promptly and there was good olive oil to use for dipping.  Then the food arrived and I was shocked to see the portions for the main. These are more tapas sized and will satisfy only the lightest of eaters. I tried the gnocchi and didn't find it interesting. The gnocchi while cooked well is not something that can be made exciting beyond a certain limit IMO. Carpaccio was a bit more interesting. The marrow  in the center was a tiny portion so again I was unsatisfied.   Grilled beef tongue was spiced well with a nice contrast of heat and sweet to balance things out. Still unfulfilled I ended up ordering the sticky toffee with vanilla ice cream. Sadly that was the best thing on the menu. The cardamon syrup adds an interesting layer to this sugary rush dish. Maybe I have become jaded and don't appreciate Italian food much anymore unless someone hits it out of the park. Sadly this place didn't do it for me.  The place is loud so don't expect to have a conversation when you are here. For the price we ended up paying here I expect a lot lot more."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. Ordered the cacio e Pepe pasta which is a must try ! One of the best white sauce based pastas in Toronto I would say! The gnocchi in spicy tomato sauce was great! They seem to be very veggie friendly and could accommodate with adding or removing meat from dishes. I also tried the aranccini which was good but not as good as the two mains !"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?  The service was impeccable at this wine bar, and considering that my friend and I started off by saying we're not wine drinkers, we needed help with the 5 paged extensive list.  Our waiter recommended a local Riesling that was just the right amount of fruitiness to get our taste buds going. It was delicious.  To start we shared the brussel sprouts with toasted almonds and cheese. The citrus dressing was flavorful, and this dish could have easily been shared with a third person. The bread basket was fresh. What really impressed me is that the waiter replaced our bread basket and filled up our waters before we even felt the need to ask. That alone is reason to give this restaurant 5 stars!  But let me tell you about the gnocchi. It is what led me to try Enoteca Sociale. In my search on yelp for gnocchi, I read the reviews here, and there is nothing more I can say about these melt-in-your-mouth pieces of heaven. As lame and corny as that may sound, I will never order gnocchi anywhere else.   While we were there, a friend of mine walked in with his sister and told us that they have a cheese cellar downstairs and that if we asked they would show us. We didn't have the time so that's reason alone to go back! And the gnocchi of course! And the service! And the atmosphere! You get the picture."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We went around 6:30pm on a Tuesday night and the place was busy but not overcrowded...yet. By the time we left 2 hours later the place was full and the noise level made it impossible to hear your dinner partner.  We were seated at one of the tables in the middle of the room and when I asked to move to the last window seat I was told it was reserved for a customer with a disability. When that particular customer came in I saw what the disability was; it seemed like their fat wallet was weighing them down and they were lightening the load at ES with a literal dinner feast. Glass after glass of wine...dining on extravagant dishes that weren't on the menu...OK enough about that...  Our server was helpfully friendly and took the time to tell us about the food on the menu (the available cheeses, which things were made in house, etc.). We had:  - GRANDE CHEESE PLATE: Overall it was OK. We had two hard Italian cheeses that had been aged in their cantina and Grey Owl cheese from Quebec. It was served with maple syrup, a berry compote, candied pecans, baguette toasts and apple slices. I wish it included some charcuterie.  - LAMB PAPPARDELLE, ONTARIO LAMB RAGU: Delicious! This is a really rich dish and you will feel stuffed by the time you're done. The house-made pasta was good in texture, density and thickness.  - TOMATO PEPERONATA TRECCE WITH PORK SAUSAGE: Not as rich as the pappardelle but just right for a meal. I felt full but not stuffed.  - LEMON OLIVE OIL CAKE WITH ROSEMARY ICE CREAM: This was pretty good and the large portion makes it great for sharing.  - ESPRESSO: I had to include this. The shot was literally a tablespoon's worth of espresso. It was good but not worth the $2.75.  All in all, I would go back again. I highly recommend going early before the rush so you get the full attention of your server. I'm not saying service goes downhill during the rush but your ability to hear your server speak does!"}
{"text":"Have been back twice since my first review. I just wanted to add that the service has consistently been on point (as I mentioned previously), and I almost always order the bucatini. It is just that good."}
{"text":"Amazing. The salami was so delicious, the cheese was incredibly flavorful, the pastas (tried four) were just what I wanted, and the rest (I'm getting full of thinking about our meal) was also on-point.  Great service to boot. Absolutely worth coming here."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken.  You must try the half/or full chicken.    I don't know what magic they use to cook it but it was absolutely delicious.    Friends had the gnocchi and it was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Yummm. This place is kind of far out there from where I was staying in downtown Toronto, but I was craving good pasta.  We got there at 7pm ish on a Sunday night and there was NO seating, so we had to sit at the bar, which was fine.   The complimentary bread was pretty good. Some focaccia that was very soft. The olive oil was weirdly spicy though. We each got an arancini which was pretty good, but honestly nothing impressive. It was huge though, and I love cheese. I got the cacio e pepe for my pasta, which is my favorite pasta of all time. IT was pretty good! Really soft noodles, larger portion than I was expecting. I would have liked the cheese to be a little stronger, but it was still really good.  Overall, i probably wouldn't come back because it was far out of the way, but if I was in the neighborhood I would."}
{"text":"Which pasta did I not like???  Wow.  I've been here a few times now and we try to eat \"family style\" so that we don't have to be stuck with just one dish, we can sample as much as we can!  Well made pastas and all the sauces are rich and flavourful.  The portions are quite filling.    Eating in the private room next to the cheese cave was a great experience too.  I always recommend this restaurant when people ask for good Italian food."}
{"text":"I really liked  it here. I've come a few times with a girlfriend of mine and we've always have had a nice dinner, wonderful service and great atmosphere. The food is deliciously flavoured and they have a nice selection and variety of menue items. It's a very intimate setting, perfect for a special outting with friends or an SO. They have a great wine list to pair with there dishes which is lovely."}
{"text":"We came here a few months after opening, and decided to wait until all of the 'kinks' of opening a new place were out before trying again. We went back again this evening and solidified our decision to not return. We were seated quickly, without a reservation, which we appreciated. We had the daily crostini, which (I'm sorry to say) tasted like well-seasoned spam. Entrees followed - a carrot mezzaluna and the rigatoni with chanterelles and pancetta. The mezzaluna was ok,  but the rigatoni, aside from having no chanterelles, was so salty from the pancetta  that my partner couldn't finish it. I should also mention that both of our wine glasses were cleared without being offered another - my partner managed to ask for another, but nothing for me! Someone came by and verbally offered the desserts, another server dropped off dessert menus and (we think) the manager took the menus away again, with a brisk 'this is wrong, we're out of panna cotta'. To top it all off, we had just decided on dessert and after-dinner drinks, when our friends (seated at another table) came by to say goodnight. During the conversation, the server reached through our friends, dropped the bill on the table, and walked away. Multiple up-sell opportunities, with zero follow-through. I suppose they're busy enough that they don't need new customers. Not to worry, there are plenty of places I'd rather spend my money.  To add insult to injury, we checked the bill again when we got home and were charged $16 for that $11 glass of wine.   Parking is paid on Dundas until 9pm, we had money in the meter until the max so that we could sit and relax, but we were out at 8:50! 40 minutes for 2 courses. No wonder they didn't have time to sell us anything else."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal last Saturday night at this establishment in Little Portugal. My girlfriend and I agreed that it was a great experience all around. The service was prompt and pleasant even though it was a full house.We started with an Aperol Spritz  as an apartiff and it was made to perfection. Maybe the best one I have ever had in Toronto. We followed that up with the short-ribs as an appetizer and the  rigatoni carbonara con fave along with spaghetti in a red sauce  with eggplant which was the special of the day. Both pasta dishes were delicious. I now understand why this place is listed as one of the best restaurants for pasta in the city. We also had the green beans and rapini as sides which were both outstanding. We finished things off with the strawberries and cream for desert which featured marscarppone as the \"cream\" topped with crushed biscotti and balsamic vinegar (sounds like a weird combination but it works unbelievably well). All-in-all it was a great meal. We will most certainly be back for another seating very soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Enoteca for a friend's birthday. The atmosphere is great and the service was spot on. Too bad the food wasn't. Well that's not true. The appetizers were amazing. I tried the brussel sprouts and the baked kale.  We were disappointed that they we couldn't get the artichoke fries as they were no longer offered on the menu.   For mains we all ordered pasta. I had read other reviews that their pasta dishes were salty. This was an understatement in our case. All 8 of us were downing glasses of water just to finish our meals. Which is unfortunate as the dishes probably would have been tasty if we could get past the saltiness.  For dessert I shared the sticky toffee pudding and it was very tasty. Kind of hard to mess up a dessert though.  All in all I probably wouldn't go back. There are too many other Italian places to waste time giving this one a second chance."}
{"text":"Recently I converted to veganism, I find it difficult when people want to go out to eat at certain places because usually you need to create your own dish at a restaurant. When I went here for dinner with a friend of mine I noticed nothing on the menu was vegan, but I was willing to compromise and eat butter.   I decided on a salad and asked for no cheese on it, and Gnocci but asked if I could have it without cheese and no meat. The server asked me if I was vegan, I said yes and he vanished off to the kitchen. HE ASKED THE KITCHEN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE ME A VEGAN GNOCCHI and I didn't even ask him to. Now that is really something great when you go in not being picky to not annoy the chefs but they really bend over backwards for you.  It was really the best meal I have had in a long time, along with the wine paring and they made me a special mango sorbet for dessert.   I will be going back here again for dinner FOR SURE. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Despite having a great birthday dinner, I was a little disappointed in comparison to our five star meal there a little while ago.  This dinner was a perfect example of how service can make or break a great dining experience. Coupled with a menu that seemed limited, our latest experience here was not as impressive.  We asked to switch tables because there was a kid on an I pad right next to us. Not to criticize parents, but this was super awful for a couple who are having a nice romantic dinner to celebrate. If your kid can't be quiet and behave at the table in public, you shouldn't be taking him or her out for dinner. Adults who can't put down their phones at the table are bad enough, but kids on giant iPads at a dimly lit Italian restaurant??? Let's just say the server was nice enough to let us move.  We started with a lemon fizz and a glass of prosecco. Lemon fizz was tart and refreshing. I also ordered a nice Barbaresco that paired well with the charcuterie plate. However, I found that the variety of charcuterie was less impressive than our pervious visit. Still delicious, but just not as varied.  The tuna conserva is one if my favourite dishes here and it was highlighted by a brilliant orange coulis and a fennel salad. Beef crudo with egg and salt and vinegar chips did not disappoint, either.  I had the linguine with pickled cherry tomatoes and white anchovy. WOW!! This was the kind if dish that makes you want to belt out some opera!! Beautiful acidity in the tomatoes was balanced perfectly by the oily and salty anchovy. It was like an amp'ed up puttanesca!  My boyfriend's carbonara was a contrasting mild blend of creamy egg, fava beans and rigatoni.   We split a tiramisu and 2 pieces of cheese for dessert. Both were good.  Our server, however, seemed overwhelmed and was rarely present. I wouldn't say the service was bad, just not comparable to the last time we were there. We were happy to bask in each other's company and not be bothered. I just think he was busy and flustered, which can happen.  Ill say that it was a nice dinner, and I would still go back because this place serves up some amazing pasta and I love the wine list."}
{"text":"First time at Enoteca. I heard it had a good reputation and was not disappointed.  Beware of the bread. I almost filled myself with this before the first bite of my meal and I wasn't starving - it is that good!  We had the pears and lonza and sausage to start.  They use pecorino with the pears which is a delicious, strong and crumbly hard cheese.  The sausage was definitely made in-house and was oily but tender.  Tried the bucatini (a favourite according to our server) and tortellini for our mains.  The pasta was cooked perfectly - al dente, which I like.  My only gripe was I found the bucatini on the salty side, likely because of the guanciale.  This may suit other taste buds though.  The tortellini was a meatless option, but cheese inside was soft and tofu-ey in texture, making up for the meat.  We had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  The chocolate budino looked interesting as well, but the toffee was so good I'd order it again.  If you're drinking wine, the valpolicella is an excellent choice and coincidentally the cheapest enomatic option! Highly recommended.    Service was very good.  Our waitress was polite, friendly and talkative.  I actually expected \"stiffer\" service and was pleasantly surprised.  They also have a neat room in the basement that I believe is their wine cellar, which is great for parties.  Definitely one of the better Italian restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday. We'd heard how good the food is, and it did not disappoint. The warm homemade bread that is brought to the table as soon as you arrive is to die for, especially the rosemary one.   We ordered deep fried risotto balls, sous vide tuna and a salad for the appetizers. Everyone had pasta for their main. The gnocchi melts in your mouth and the sauce is amazing. The spiced ricotta is a great touch. One of the best pastas I've ever had. For dessert highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding. It was an instant hit with everyone.  Wines are also very good. Most are not available at the LCBO, so try several. Not a huge restaurant so make sure you make a reservation, and enjoy."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went here for dinner last night and had a great time.  Our waiter, Scott, was very helpful with the menu, was able to explain and tell us about dishes (right down to where the meat came from and the cheese). He also recommended excellent wine choices, we were pleased with every one of them.  We tried the mussels, dandelion and chicory root salad, perch, Spaghetti with clams, and stick toffee pudding for dessert.   The flavours really popped in each dish, even the salad!  The food was simple, fresh and with quality ingredients.  We wanted to eat the whole menu.  We shall definitely be back. I don't know what the 3 star reviewers are complaining about... maybe they should go back to East Side Mario's if that's more their speed."}
{"text":"Many people have told us about Enoteca Sociale and we have determined it is all true after our dinner there.  We loved alll of our meals and in particular the pasta with butternut squash but overal the bread with the dark crusts was the highlight!   The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the table at the entrance where the cold wind came in every time the door opened.  The service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of great reviews about this place, so I made plans to have Sunday dinner at Enotect Sociale.  It' a cute and warm place that is very inviting, not pretencious.  The place was full of people by 7pm. The food was great, and would recomend sharing plates to get the best experience of dinning here.  The service from our server was fantastic, and I must say after dinning out a lot I find it very rare to receive such enthusiastic service.  I'd love to return with a larger group of friends to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I will have to go back to give it a more valid rating (I didn't even sample any cheeses from the famous cheese cave) but I am inclined to say that these Italian dishes, though extremely delicious, were not a revelation for me.  I'm not raving to my friends and adding yet another voice to the toronto food echo chamber about how good this place is.   The atmosphere is pretty casual but still buzzy, and you feel rushed- they clearly have a high turnover rate. The waiter was a helpful food-snob and suggested some good dishes. A standout one was a rich appetizer- \"arancini con mozzarella di bufala & soppressata\"- basically fried risotto rice balls with mozzarella di bufala inside sitting in a tomato-based sauce with soppressata. A slight misstep was that their house-made gnocchi was way too soft. I know that delicate and light texture is to be strived for in gnocchi, but this seemed over-the-top to me. Maybe I'm just an ignorant pleb, though.  The menu items come paired with wine suggestions and we went with them. The dishes are small but this is quite appropriate as they are very rich. I will go back sometime and see if my second experience lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Enoteca Sociale is famous for their fresh pastas, and now I finally know why. Their SOFT gnocchi was simply divine with tomato, chili and smoked ricotta. Who can say no to smoked ricotta?! I always feel like smoked cheese tastes like meat and it worked so well with the gnocchi. I will definitely be back to try more of their pastas!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.  Arancini came piping hot but I couldn't wait. I just couldn't stop myself from diving into that cheesy carby goodness.  The Gnocchi were excellent. Gnocchi is always something I love the idea and want to order but many times am disappointed because that texture and preparation is so hard to achieve. The ones here were so velvety melt in your mouth soft and so tasty.  My favorite pasta of the night was a rigatoni with rabbit. There was no overwhelming gamey flavor but the meaty quality of it added so much to the overall dish. The pasta was also so fresh and delicious.  There were a few things we had that I'm having trouble remembering (the Grilled Romaine  and the Grilled Short Ribs) making me think that Enoteca Sociale's highlights really lie in its pasta."}
{"text":"Salty, pricey and just not good enough for supposedly being one of the best Italian places in Toronto. I want my money back. Go to Terroni's. it's a lot better."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Professional service. Not too in your face. The pastas are amazing. Very fair prices. The salads are very fresh. I always wanna try other stuff but always end up getting the pastas.  Desserts are good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"A very unassuming restaurant that is a hidden treasure. Food is very European - simple, fresh and uncluttered. Nice little patio and friendly staff make this a great restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Over the years I've dine there on occasion, and each time will have me thinking about the meal for days on end. A few days ago I've had the delight to celebrate my birthday in the wine cellar.   The food is top notch, every course was delicious. Each time they bring a course it's like a new act in an opera, feast for your eyes and fireworks in your taste buds, each was amazing and can stand on it's own.   Amazing atmosphere in the wine cellar, and our server is friendly and a delight. Feels right at home at the best possible way, it was a night to remember. Thank you for being a part of my birthday, Enoteca Sociale!"}
{"text":"A++ spot if you're looking for GREAT eats, friendly staff, and nice ambience. Right when we arrived the smiley hostess took our jackets and showed us to a cozy spot perfect for our date night. We could see the great wine selection, and right into the kitchen, which is always fun. We were super hungry so dug right into the bread and olive oil that was provided... the crust was so good and the bread was so chewy and soft! Impressed before our meal even started. Then Gary came and told us all about the wines, and helped us newbs pick one out. He made a great choice. We ordered the cheese plate, and he asked about our preferences, and brought us an amazing selection of three hard cheese, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Our server, Lisa, told us about the special, which I got (Uova da Raviolo with Wild Mushrooms), and recommended the brussels sprouts to share, and said my husband MUST get the Bucatini. We devoured everything that came... the Raviolo was sooooooo good. The perfect combo of egg, cheese and mushrooms. Mmmmm I am having flashbacks now. Also, the brussels sprouts are UNREAL. Like, don't even think about not ordering a batch of those bad boys. We also tried the cannelloni (despite being full at this point), which was top notch. Lisa popped by at the exact right times (to take orders, fill glasses, etc). Food was very reasonably priced for what you get, and although the wine is more expensive than perhaps your average resto, it is a WINE BAR, and all of the wines we tried were delicious and worth it. Overall, we loved everything and would recommend this place to anyone! Go now! K BYE!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!   Everything we ordered was delicious - I can't wait to go back.   The service was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Almost a full restaurant on a Monday? They must be doing something right!  I came in here with the SO for dinner, and it was lively to say the least! We were seated promptly. The ambience is a lovely combination of rustic with modern elements.   We ordered a couple of arancini balls, and the trout crudo to start. And a couple of pasta dishes - amatriciana and turkey tagliatelle.   House bread with olive oil - Just perfect way to start.  Arancini - Crunchy on the outside, soft and cheesy on the inside with a beautiful tomato sauce. Probably one of the best I've had.  Trout Crudo - It's a delicate dish! I should have eaten this before the arancini... and saved some bread. oh well... Amatriciana  and Tagliatelle - Perfectly al dente paired with balanced sauces. If you are craving pasta, you are at the right place.   The cocktails looked great, but I didn't drink this time. I'll have to make a trip down here again - maybe in the summer for the patio!"}
{"text":"Just a week before Christmas my partner and I decided to splurge on a huge, delicious, relaxing Italian dinner together before a week of family outings and events occupied our vacation, and Enoteca Sociale was the best decision we could have made.  Our reservation was for 6pm but we showed up a bit earlier and were given our choice of seating right away. The service from start to finish was attentive, warm, knowledgeable and hospitable, from wine selections to a choice of entree and dessert.  We started with the cheese platter which featured a selection of soft cheese, a goats cheese, blue and a hard cheese, with wine and beer. As we nibbled our octopus arrived and it was really was one of the shiny hits of the evening, with a savoury tomato base, meaty, chewy and nommy. I've never had octopus this delicious in Toronto or anywhere else so far, the bar is raised!  For my entree I had a rutabaga agnolotti with the most delicious chanterelles, in a maple butter sauce which blew my top off. Portions were smaller but the food was so rich I was completely full.  But of course, I HAD to go for the panna cotta which was a nice, light, crisp finale to the evening, with a sweet Noans wine, a blend of Riesling, Gewurz and Sauvignon Blanc, a perfect topper to the evening.   All together, a cheese platter, appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and 4 alcoholic beverages with tax and tip came to about $150, but shave off the cheese platter and wine or dessert and it's more affordable, but we wanted it all :)  I would absolutely go again, I'd love to try some of the other entrees, especially the Pappardelle with Lamb, it's been in my dreams since, I swear."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I wasn't impressed. This could be do to the high expectations I had going into the meal, but I felt I was promised a whole lot, and didn't get the payoff.   Enoteca Sociale prides itself on being Rustic Italian food with heart, or so, this is all I heard before going. The restaurants design and atmosphere is humble and modest, not trying to impress you with any high design, but rather have you focus on the important stuff: food and wine. I was excited to finally find a go-to restaurant for home made pasta, whenever I yearned a taste of Rome. Once seated, I found out I wouldn't be having my fresh home made pasta, since they ran out earlier in the night and all that was left was the 'hard' kind. I'm not discriminating against hard pasta, but hey, I went for the homemade version. It wasn't all that bad. Let's start from the beginning....  I arrived at 8:30P without a reservation, hoping to grab one of those 'first come, first serve' tables. We were greeted unusually. No real friendliness with a hint of a sour attitude. The hostess told us it would be about a 2 hour wait, and asked if we would still want to put our name down. I felt like she was trying to convince me to leave. Did she have a bad day, did I tick her off, or was she just mad at the world? The human psyche...geez. My friend and I decided not to take the 2 hour wait time too seriously and figured we'd stick it out. After 30 minutes of no one checking in on us and squeezing against a wall to avoid being in the way, we decided to take our evening into our own hands. Stopped a waiter passing by and asked him to recommend some wines. We ordered a bottle of  one of the most delicious wine's I've ever tasted from Chianti (THEY HAVE AN AMAZING WINE LIST), and started making friendly with the hostesses. The next thing we knew, we were being ushered to our table, with a basket of sumptuous, addicting bread. Unfortunately it was not the home made kind, but the night was getting better, so I ordered another basket - I'm so naughty. Our waitress ushered over and gave me the bad news about the pasta but suggested some other options.  I ordered:  SPAGHETTI CACIO E PEPE - Lack luster. Since the ingredients were simple I was hoping for them to be bold but the pecorino couldn't hold up and I tasted mostly pepper. The pasta was also not cooked to my preference. ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLES- I did not like these at all. It was more on the bland side. Where were the fresh herbs, the sea salt???.. RICOTTA TIRAMISU- This was good, but I've definitely had better.  SIDE NOTE: To be fair..I have a bit of a bias. I don't eat red meat...The secrets out! Off with her head! Enoteca is heavily a meat menu so there weren't many options. I read from other reviewers that the meat dishes were delectable.  We finished the bottle of wine without any problem and enjoyed our time catching up in the bustling warm ambience. I'd like to give Enoteca Sociale another shot, but it's a bit down in the priority list of restaurants to eat at next. In my opinion, if you're torn between Woodlot and Enoteca one night, go with Woodlot."}
{"text":"Enoteca Sociale is one of those spots that always there for when you want to have a nice dinner out but don't feel like getting done up to the nines.   The service is always wonderful and they have a GREAT private room downstairs for intimate dinner parties. Drinks a good as well.  My only wish is that they'd change up the menu more often. It would great to see more variety. When they do make a stuffed pasta, it's always amazing.   Their Sticky Toffee Pudding has to be the best I've ever had. I always look forward to that after dinner."}
{"text":"I can't think of any aspect of the dinner that want amazing. Their spaghetti makes me cry with joy."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars.  7 years ago I met Ofelia in Beijing. We were in the city during the Paralympic games of 2008 and I had a blast hanging out with her all around the parks; 8 km of the Great Wall (Simatai Area); the Temple of Heaven; the Summer Palace, etc... I felted as if I met her before...  She came to Toronto to be a volunteer at the PanAm games and I couldn't wait to meet her; but the occasion demanded a special spot, so I researched about the best italian restaurants in Toronto, and the name Enoteca Sociale appeared within the first 10 names. After reading some favourable reviews of trusworthy fellow yelpers, I had no doubt that the place was the perfect fit.  I made a reservation for Thusday at 7, and that was a good move because the place got crowded quickly. The staff was really friendly, trendy, good looking, effective, and fast. The ambiance is great. The decoration is modern, eclectic, and I want some of those cool bulbs they display in their lamps.  We ordered a Rosso Cornero (62 dls ) that we all considered was delightful; a most try for every wine enthusiast. The perfect match for that enchanting potion was the trio of the most succulent cheeses I've ever tried. The quality of all the ingredients that accompanied those cheeses from Mars did matched the circumstances; the bread is sinful and I have kinky dreams with those nuts.  While waiting for the pastas I looked inside the kitchen, and it was amazing to see the energy that such a small spot had. More than 4 people running around, moving really quick, looking like in a master chef competition.  From the 3 pastas we ordered, the spaghetti won the more compliments, followed by the gnochi.  We ended up with a perfect expresso with grapa.  When I picked the place, I went inside the web page and I liked a lot the pictures, the concept, and life story of the chef. Everything satisficed the expectations."}
{"text":"Having read about Enoteca placing in the best new restaurants of 2011 and it being my boss's favorite restaurant I was pretty excited to try this place. My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday night for 8:30 dinner reservation. We arrived 10 minutes earlier and was seated immediately. Service was good, waiter was nice and knowledgeable. Food was ok. They didn't have the tasting menu that my boss recommended so we ordered what the server recommended and what also what had good reviews. Grilled octopus, rice balls with cheese inside, and the house made pappardelle. Octopus was good and I can see why everyone raves about it, which is the manner in which it was cooked (\"wok hey\" taste), but in my opinion, you an easily find that cooking style in just about every chinese restaurant. Every time I hear rice balls, I assume it will be good because I see a lot of it on the food network, but these rice balls were bland and so was the sauce. House made pappardelle was the best dish. I liked how it's hand made pasta in house and the lamb was good but that was that. Servings were small so don't go on an empty stomach. I don't think I would ever crave any of these dishes again so I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the negative reviews on here. Most of them are sour grapes due to botched reservations, wait times, etc. The food is excellent. Best italian in the city. The cheeses are exquisite. The pasta marvelous. Go and eat there. Wait if you have to. But go."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and friendly service.  The place feels professional and cozy at the same time - no small feat.  I ordered the Montefalco wine - hard to find and delicious, the PEI Cheddar plate which came with raw honey; crisp, green apples; candied, spiced pecans; and crispy bread.  That cheese plate alone could have been a mini-meal.  The honey is excellent and goes well with the snacks.  For a main, the soft, pillowy gnocchi can't be beat.  So soft, just a hint of spice, fresh tomatoey goodness.  Oh, so good!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience at this \"neighborhood\" restaurant. I had heard good things about it and was not disappointed. Great service, excellent unusual dishes and warm atmosphere. If there were any complaint, it's that this very popular restaurant fills up in a hurry and is not overly spacious (all the better to get to know your fellow diners).  This was my second attempt to eat there; the first time we were turned away given the likelihood of at least a 45 minute wait without a reservation (and that was arriving at about 8:30PM)."}
{"text":"Casual decor belies truly outstanding food made from the freshest of ingredients. In what comes across as your local neighborhood Italian restaurant is anything but...its menu is unique, culinary expertise above par, and wine and cheese selection outstanding. The service was great, friendly, and very knowledgable about the menu. I suggest ending the meal with some dessert wine and one of the cheese plates, and start the meal with the fried buffala mozzarella balls in a homemade tomato and spicy sausage sauce."}
{"text":"Must try: FORMAGGI E SALUMI!  Pasta portion is small but really tasty! (no wonder it is under $19)  Service is good and I wish I can sit beside the window next time, coz it is quite dark."}
{"text":"This review is long over due but i came with a group of people with a craving for carbs.  We all ordered a different type of pasta and and they were all on par and fantastic ie.  Lamb Ragu.   However i ordered the simplest of pasta the Cacio e pepe (cheese and black pepper) not expecting much but hot damm! It was theee best pasta ive ever had! Who knew! This was probably over a year ago people and i STILL remember how good that dish was.  Perfectly cooked al dente pasta and perfectly executed seasoning ive yet to have it as good anywhere else.   Oh their crudos were wonderful too! Ahhh till we meet again Cacio e pepe!"}
{"text":"Although the wait was nearly an hour for a table of 2 on a Friday night (too last minute to make reservations).....the food was decent enough to make the wait worth it!  We were hungry hungry and just wanted to order right away. I ordered the spicy octopus + sausage tomato pasta and my lovely friend ordered the dried pasta? I'm not really sure what her dish was called.   Both pasta dishes had extremely chewy pasta and it was fresh like the way I want it.  I liked that my pasta sauce had a lil added spicy kick to it!  I enjoyed the bread and olive oil that they served at the beginning of our meal. I ordered a second batch of the seasoned/rosemary (?) bread. It was so soft and just delicious with the olive oil.   Loved the dessert: Lemon/blueberry souffle. OMg so AMAZING. perfect for a full belly because of the sweet/tarte flavours of the lemon. It was so fluffy and light !! really delicate and pretty presentation too.   I would go back!!! Minus 1 star for our SUPER SUPER long wait!!!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant on so many levels..  when my friend suggested we go here i wasn't really crazy about the idea.. only because I just got back from Culinary trip to Italy, took some amazing cooking classes.. and ate really amazing food while abroad... but... decided to give it a try when a few restaurants told me there were no last minute seats avail when i called.. and i am so glad i gave enoteca sociale a try..   my bf and i arrived at the restaurant around 6:50pm, we were expecting our friends to arrive at 7, so asked for seat for four and was seated at the communal table... my bf and I ordered a drink and an appetizer.. (deep fried risotto with mozzarela di buffala) was absolutely delicious... well, my friends ended up being an hour late and i felt guilty about taking up the seats,  but not once our server gave us hard time about it, in fact, he was so kind enough to bring us warm bowl of olives so we don't get hungry..! and the bowl of olives was so delicious!!!  Pastas were so fresh, i had the mushroom tortellini and my bf had pork sausage with some twisted pasta, was absolutely delicious!! lots of depth in flavor that only a great cook can create..   everything my bf and i ordered were suggested by my server Chris, if you are lucky enough get him as your server, I say order what he suggests.. from wine to appi to pasta, everything was lip smacking delicious and of course his service really added to our experience.. not too casual yet comfortable and homsey... meticulous yet not too fussed... I loved everything..  this was my last official meal in Toronto as i am moving back to Vancouver tomorrow, and I really enjoyed my evening.... thank you Enoteca Sociale!"}
{"text":"Mildly disappointing given its rave reviews.  The food was yummy and the ambiance was good but the service was terrible! Typical stuck-up \"we are a fancy and trendy restaurant so we don't have to be nice to you\" attitude. I can't handle that and I certainly won't pay to be treated that way.  We had finished our appetizer before we had to waive down our server to have our  order taken. When we asked her if she could take our order, she replied: \"sure\". Sure? How about: sorry I totally forgot about you after I delivered your app.   Nevertheless, 3 stars earned for food. It was pretty fab."}
{"text":"Pasta and starters are very good. I cannot give 4 stars because of the meat. Was very greasy and expensive. The dessert was very good too. I spent 95$ for 1 starter, 1 pasta, 1 serving of meat, 1 pudding and 1 drink. I suggest to go there but don't eat the meat!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for pasta. I've dined here several times and have always enjoyed it. Reservations are recommended, the patio outside is nice and relaxing. The service is great too, the waiters take the time to explain their menu. For the price you pay, the portions could be larger. You're probably looking at around $30-$50 per person. The pastas are fresh and I believe made in house. The sauces are light and well balanced with the ingredients. Nothing stood out in the appetizer section, it's all about the pastas. I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, oh it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places in TO so far.  The place is adorable, just my kind of place.  Small, intimate, dark... staff I want to be friends with.    Went the first time without a reservation and we lucked out and got two seats at the bar.  I personally love the atmosphere of the bar, and I asked the bartender to just take liberties with wine pairings for the things we ordered.  I loved that he was up for it, asked a few questions about what I liked and then just made decisions for me.  Good work, sir.  We started with the risotto balls.  My boyfriend is obsessed with risotto balls in general, so we order them every time they're on the menu.  By far the best we've had in a very long time.  For dinner we shared the cacio e pepe and the gnocchi.  The pastas could NOT have been better.  The gnocchi is like a tiny pillow made of heaven, happiness and carbs.  I firmly believe that this gnocchi could not have been better made if italian angel-chefs flew down from heaven and made them.  Delicious.    Can not WAIT to return."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta, fresh salads, comfort desserts & delicious wine....what else do you need to know?  Real food made, fresh in intimate restaurant environment with superior service = perfection  I ordered the fresh vegetable root salad that was so simple, delicious & healthy, I have to figure out how to replicate this at home.  We had the mozzarella in risotto, the squid ink pasta, the cacio e pepe.  The homemade pastas were delicious.  My husband had the sticky toffee pudding & I had the chocolate terrine.  Both were good but the hot, gooey sticky toffee pudding is what I would order next time  I loved the Italian Cab: 2013 Luigi Righetti, Veneto, though the server said it wasn't his preferred style of cab, it was definitely mine:  oaky, earthy, vanilla..yum!!  We won't be coming back soon, as we're just tourists here, but if I was a Toronto resident, I'd be a  frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night, and we were not disappointed.  We appreciate our date nights and they made it go perfectly. It is officially on my top list of restaurants.  When we got there we were offered seating inside or outside, we decided inside. The ambiance is quite dark and everyone is chatting but not too loud where we can't hear each other. They have a very simple menu and prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you get.  We ordered:  - Arancini (delicious) -Cacio e Pepe (simple) -Beef broth Tortelini (light but flavourful) -Green beans (Flavourful) -Sticky toffee pudding (AH MAZING, that's all)  They gave us complimentary bread with the most delicious Olive Oil I've ever tasted - it was very strong and I really like when I can taste the Olives.  Overall, prices were reasonable, service was great, ambiance romantic, quality and food was delicious!  Will continue to come back"}
{"text":"Pretty good pastas with great wines pretty much sums this place up.  The staff is friendly and pretty knowledgeable about their wines and their food.  They had a special when we went with half off enoteca wines which are their premium red wines.  Delicious.  The appetizers we had were nothing to rave about (bruschetta, and mussels) but werent terrible.  The pastas made up for it.  The gnocchi was one of the best Ive had, the tomato sauce it came in was simple yet perfectly tart, salty, and sweet with a touch of basil.  The gnocchi itself just melted in your mouth.  We also had the Trecce pasta with octopus and sausage.  The pasta itself was al dente, the octopus perfectly cooked, but the sausage was overcooked and a little dry.  Dessert was decent as well.  Would definitely recommend anyone who loves pasta and wine to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Enoteca is located west of Ossington on Dundas St. I came here on a weekday evening. The neighbourhood wasn't too bustling at this time of night but the restaurant itself was pretty busy. I like the look of it, wooden floors and tables, candles, chalkboard menus here and there. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Her knowledge of the menu and wine choices was appreciated. I went with the autumn squash anolini  paired with Tawes reisling. All their menu items have a suggested wine pairing (very cool!) however after discussing the sweetness level of the suggested wine, I went with an alternative reisling. My friend got the lamb rigatoni for main and the grilled raddichio and burrata (type of cheese) for appetizer.  The meal started with bread and olive -nothing too exciting. The appetizer came first, I tried a little, lovely flavours and the cheese was very fresh. Our meals then came; mine was a little on the smal size (like 12-15 quarter sized raviolli) tossed with mushrooms. However the flavour and heartyness of the meal made up for the small serving, it was excellent!!! I tried my friends rigatoni; it was ok, but I'd say my plate was tastier :).  For dessert we shared the hazlenut brittle. I was expecting something similar to peanut brittle paired with chocolate and nuts. Instead we got 2 cookies and an adorable jar filled with a concoction of chocolate base, whip cream and nut toppings. That jar packed so much wonderful flavour (now I want to serve my desserts in little jars!! too cute).  All in all, great dining experience. My meal came to $45 with tip, which is fair considering the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"Just wasn't feeling this restaurant. Maybe it was an off night, but all the food was very salty. The best thing we ordered was the beet salad, which had a really nice cream dressing that was perfect to wipe clean with the bread at the table. As a sidenote, the bread was totally amazing, and the olive oil that was set at the table was delicious. Not sure if it was a special kind of olive oil or what, but it was in the top 10 of the EVOO world IMO...  I got the pescorino pasta(?) and it was tasty, but very salty. The steelhead fish was also quite salty, and at $32, the portion and accompaniments were more than a little lacking. Finally, we got the fried brussels sprouts, and man were those things fried. They were also super salty and had this cheese sauce that looked like queso sauce at a downtown Mexican restaurant. But saltier. Way saltier. I think the brussels sprouts can be kept solo without that cheese fiesta, and the salt levels can be cut down. We also got the toffee putting which was good. People seem to rave about it, didn't blow my mind, but it was good.  Tough to get a two star review, but compared to the dining experiences we've had recently in downtown Toronto, there were just too many things that were doing it for as this night. The restaurant is totally beautiful though, and hats off for nice decor, nice atmosphere, and I'm sure it's a good spot if you want to have conversation over chowchow."}
{"text":"I ended up in the private cellar room with cheese cave view after yet another failure to get in to the Hoof, but lady luck smiled and we were in for a night of great conversation, wine, various local cheese and delicious food.    Anytime I can have well executed octopus en route to a beautifully braised Oxtail, I'm a happy man.  A few glasses of good wine more and I'm telling crazy stories about shark diving or turkey testicles."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to come here?  We had the escarole salad - I won't get into details on that as many have reviewed it - it's nom nom heaven ... but we also shared the arancini balls (aka rice balls in delicious tomato sauce). One per person is really plenty unless you're a pig and must over-indulge but why bother when the bread and olive oil they bring to the table is so good.   I had the agnolotti, when reading the description - Peas, fava beans, mint, preserved lemon & goat butter ... I first thought this is going to be so heavy but trusted the waitress and ordered it anyway ... thank god! Best pasta dish I've ever tasted. The freshness of the lemon, peas, fava and mint is a really nice balance to the stuffed goat cheese and butter.   My husband ordered the smoked spaghetti - Manila clams, fennel sausage, chili & parsley - the smoke factor was incredible. You could really smell and taste it with every bite and don't worry it's not a sausage fest in your dish.   We opted not to order the dessert b/c why ruin the party in your mouth when you're plenty full but I saw people enjoying the sticky toffee pudding. The appetizers I also saw the table next to us enjoying was the fried asparagus with anchovies. Their main was the agnolotti as well but they also enjoyed a fine looking piece of steak.   Atmosphere is great and staff are attentive without being over-bearing.   Must go people!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. First, a little housekeeping before we get to the food: service was excellent and the space was really lovely. Not too crammed, and the decor was modern - rustic (if there ever was a thing). Cheap parking nearby.   My friends and I ordered the arincini and five, yes five, of the pastas to share. The complimentary bread basket was insanely good. I mean, it's bread. But this was GOOD bread.   The arincini was so delectable. I like that they kept it simple. Risotto, cheese, crispy breading. Super sweet tomato sauce to accompany.   Pasta - in order of best to good.   Amertricana- insane. The crispy pancetta was a thing of beauty.   Pesto and walnut something - such a lovely dish. Nutty, light, but filling. I know, a major contradiction but trust me.   Ricotta gnocchi- pillows of heaven. I almost wish they were more tough, but I can't hate on a pillowy gnocchi. I do wish there was more chili as the description promised.   Cacio e pepe- not enough pepper. Delectable but underwhelming in comparison to Terroni.   Lamb tortellini - pasta was perfect. Broth was insanely good. My companions loved this one and while I thought it was delicious, I don't love lamb and probably would prefer beef (personal preference, so not a knock on the dish).   The sticky toffee pudding was a let down. It was too gritty, unfortunately.   With a good amount of wine, our tab for 3 people was a mere $50 + tax and tip. Can't beat that. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I want to make this place a staple of my eating-out diet.  An aside: one can sometimes sum up a restaurant based entirely on the quality of it's bread. This place has great bread. The night we went they served both a dense yet extremely soft loaf and a more porous, crunchy ciabatta-type of bread. I had an intense urge to swipe some into my purse at one point. Dammit for being seated in the middle of the restaurant.   Apart from the bread, this is what we had:  -Albacore tuna crudo (with lemon, celery, rosemary and pepper) - this struck me as more of an asian inspired dish, reminiscent of seared sashimi. Delicious nonetheless, with the celery and lemon adding a refreshing touch. Our neighbours seemed to also be enjoying the octopus and potato appetizer from the \"mmm\"s and \"ahh\"s coming from their table.  -Pappardelle (with lamb ragu) - perfectly al dente wide strips of pasta, tender but slightly chewy, while the lamb ragu had a wonderful depth of flavour to it with very tasty chunks of ground lamb.  -Bucatini all'amantriciana (tubular pasta in a tomato sauce with pork cheek) - this was an amazing dish, simple in the best way possible with each component of the pasta, sauce and meat done perfectly. Could have had bowlfuls of this.  -Gnocchi (with tomato sauce, sausage and a type of mozarella) - pillowy and soft, with a bit of a bite to it from the spiciness of the sausage, and a nice complement with the mildness and soft texture of the cheese.  -Tiramisu (with ricotta and lemon zest) - nicely done... The mains really outshone the dessert. Still, a nice finish to the meal.  The service was quick. At times, a bit too quick... which was my only (minor) quip with the place. Lingering (within reason of course) and soaking up the atmosphere of a restaurant is part of the fun of dining out, personally. The waiters seemed to be constantly monitoring our plates and whisked them away immediately after finishing, even though we were well within our reservation time. Small quibble though.  The ratings on this place are well-deserved."}
{"text":"All I can say: \"Wow, this is really, really good.\"   Arancini with 'nduja was... uuuunf. Perfectly deep fried, rich mozz core offset by dereciious tomato sauce. And ah, you can't go wrong with their pastas - al dente done right!   4.5/5  Recommendation: Arancini with 'nduja"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum yum. The food here is so fresh and so delicious. We took my mom for dinner on Saturday night. Go early - we went a little before 7, no reservation, and got a table on the patio. As we were leaving at 9, people were being told a minimum of an hour wait.   The pasta is amazing. I had the one with the rabbit ragu which was lighter than expected and really delicious. My mom had the ravioli and loved it. Desserts are great too! I was full so just had some of the others' desserts and was glad I tried them.  Great service. Lovely patio. One more yum for good measure."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner Specialty: Italian / Roman Cuisine Menu items: Sea Bream Crudo, Toasted Spaghetti, Mezzaluna & Chocolate Mousse Cake   Enoteca Sociale is a fantastic Romanesque paradise found in the new and upcoming Parkdale district of Toronto.  It seems more and more \"Enoteca\" style restaurants are opening in town. When I told friends I was going to Enoteca, they asked which one? So my mind started to wonder about its meaning. Simply put, Enotecas are wine bars that offer a social cantina-style feel and specialize in selected menus paired with local and regional wines; and in the case of this Enoteca, Roman inspired dishes that are paired with Ontario and Italian wines, as recommended by their sommelier.  But wine is not so much what drove my taste buds to write a post on Enoteca. It was its fantastic atmosphere, service and delightful Italian dishes.  So first things first, the service. I haven't felt such calm, relaxation and assurance on the promise of a meal experience as I felt at Enoteca Sociale, especially on a busy Friday night service. The manager makes sure all his staff and customers are well treated, and the service does not fall short of perfect. I honestly thought it was just luck with my waiter, but as I looked around the entire room and staff, felt just as pleased as I was. So bravo to Enoteca for their spot on service.  Now on to the food. To start off, Enoteca makes some of their bread in house. Upon being seated, we were offered water and bread while we waited for the rest of our party. That night, a lovely rosemary focaccia was flourescing on the basket. The focaccia had a light hard shell with a very foamy-soft centre, the taste of the rosemary came through as I bit on it and became more present as I sipped my wine.  Our appetizer course arrives, and its a very well executed Sea Bream crudo. Crudo means \"raw\" in Italian. Is a raw fish dish dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and citrus juice such as lemon juice and sometimes vinegar. Knowing how tough it is to make fish taste good when raw, I praised the chefs at Enoteca for making a hit out of this dish. Instead of just sticking to the traditional way of serving it, they created a dish that was perfectly seasoned with olive oil, basil, and fennel pollen, which in my mind was the \"pièce de résistance\". Fennel pollen is a new spice to North American cuisine. Discovered and mostly used in Italy, this unique spice has made its way to many kitchens and is quickly becoming a staple in imported Italian cuisine. The process of extracting the fennel powder and seeds, from the plant, by hand, makes this spice hard to get and quite expensive. But its potent and unique flavour will turn any dish from good, to great.  Knowing I needed to leave room for the pasta dishes coming our way, I left some bread on the side to enjoy alla \"dip\" style. That's how one carries through a pasta dish till the end, once the plate is wiped clean.  So, ever heard of Toasted Spaghetti? I hadn't heard of it till I visited Enoteca Sociale. The toastiness comes from the way the pasta is made. Served with clams, the spaghetti is first toasted in olive oil, then slowly cooked with the clam juice, risotto style, until the pasta is al dente. This process gives a nutty flavour to the noodles and darkens it in colour. Though this was a good start to my pasta experience, I have to admit, it was not my personal preference. Don't get me wrong, the dish was great, and some people in my party also thought so too, just was not for me.  Next up, and one that elevated Enoteca's status as a pasta expert, was the Mezzaluna. Mezzaluna is a type of pasta known for the way its cut into a half-moon shape. Which is literally its translation in English. The Mezzaluna was filled with wild leek and bathed in a light a tasty creamy sauce. The pasta was fresh, al dente and light. Topped with breadcrumbs, the whole dish had the perfect balance between texture and flavour.  And as it is tradition with me, desserts are always on the menu and there is always room for dessert. A chocolate mousse cake concoction, felt like heaven and a sweet way to end the meal.  Enoteca Sociale changes their dessert menu often, so I can't really recall the exact name of the dessert, but it read along the lines of a Chocolate Mousse Cake. It was decadent, nutty, spongy, creamy and crunchy all in one bite. Let's just say I had way to many bites, until once again, the plate was wiped clean. Can't wait to go back for more.  Buen Provecho,  Viviana."}
{"text":"Of four of us who ate here, two were happy with our orders and two had dishes that were extremely (unpleasantly) salty. The service was also very slow on a Thursday evening. On the plus side, we did enjoy our cocktails as well as the lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. I think it deserves more than its four stars. Pasta was outstanding. Cooked perfectly al dente. You can tell they make the pasta themselves. Delicious. We had three kinds at our table: caico e pepe, carbonara, and amatriciana. All three were so tasty, but I'd have to say the caico e pepe was the stand out. Yum. We also tried the arancini, which were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. Also a great dish. My father had the branzino. It's probably the best preparation of branzino I've ever tasted, and I only had a small bite. Very well done. Three of us shared the Ontario ribeye with our pasta. So flavorful and cooked nicely. It's why I always try to order steak at an Italian restaurant over a steakhouse. Focus goes into the flavor of the cooking rather than just the quality of the steak. Slow service, but I think it's just because I'm American."}
{"text":"We went to Enoteca with high expectations. Sadly, they remained mostly unfulfilled.   First, the good. The service. It was excellent. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive without being overbearing. While booking, my wife had mentioned that this was our anniversary and when we arrived, so did two glasses of champagne. A friendly, welcoming touch that was much appreciated.   The bread arrived promptly and scored another hit. Really high quality, with nice olive oil for dipping.   My wife ordered the tuna cooked sous vide, I ordered the beef carpaccio with roasted one marrow. The tuna arrived with shaved fennel, dressed with oranges. I was deeply flavored, nicely offset with the freshness if the fennel and citrus.   The carpaccio on the other hand....wasn't. The beef had been cured, so rather than a juicy plate of cow sushi, I was served what amounted to little more than a couple of slices of cold cuts. Really disappointing and a shame. The dish wasn't bad, but it was boring, without life.   My wife then ordered the pork chop, I ordered the bass in a tomato broth. The chop looked beautiful but was perhaps a little on the undercooked side. I get the idea of not cooking pork to death, but the chop in question was chewy. Perhaps a brine could have brought some more juiciness to it. It was ok, but not great.   My fish was a huge disappointment. It was indelible. The second it arrived at the table, it smelled old. The first bite confirmed it, it was fishy and muddy. The waiter reacted extremely graciously to my comment and whipped the dish back to the kitchen. When she returned to the table she told me that the chef was concerned that the entire fish delivery was of similar quality and asked me to pick a different dish.   Here's where the evening switched from 'not great but ok food' to 'I don't think we'll be coming back here'. If a kitchen knows that an ingredient is suspect, and the smell alone should have alerted them, then why send it out? Were they hoping that somehow the diner would not notice, or just politely put up with a sub standard meal?  We finished the meal with two ok but not earth shattering desserts. Oh, and the IPA was great.   Three stars because the service really deserves five stars. Two for the kitchen, evens out of three."}
{"text":"loved the decor here! the patio is small but definitely fits a decent amount of tables, we just had a table by the window. started off with arincinis and the chicken liver mousse, both were delicious! i had their famous spaghetti caco e pepe - and completely devoured it. i couldn't stop eating, it got a little dry by the end but was still great! my friend got the triangoli, very savoury, doesn't look like a big portion but it fills you up! enoteca definitely didn't disappoint, i'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, through and through. Simple recipes of delicious authentic Italian food. I highly recommend the panzanella to start- it's unbelievable. The burratta in that salad is unrivaled. I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and would go back a million times over to get it again. So creamy, so simple, and perfectly al dente. Just delicious. I also tried the Bucatini Al Amatriciana which was great, but just a bit salty for my taste. Loved the spice in it though.   I would definitely recommend the Cacio e Pepe, not only because it is creamy heavenly decadence, but because the restaurant also matches every single order of that dish with a donation to MealShare. So you're ordering one for yourself and one for someone who really needs it. It's a win-win situation.   Side note- the fresh bread is insane. Just believe me."}
{"text":"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.  Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here!   Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.  In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was way too salty. I had the tomato sauce on pasta and while the noodles were cooked right the sauce was way too salty. Wine was good though."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant - possibly restaurant, no adjective - in Toronto. I love this place.  Pasta is delicious, housemade, and reasonably priced. Their cacio e pepe is my fave - but I haven't had a bad one yet. They have a tagliatelle with side stripe shrimps right now that is fantastic. Apps and main dishes are also great, and the whole fish is always solid. And although their focaccia isn't as great as it used to be, it's still very good. Wine list, though pricey, is excellent.   I've been here more times than I can count, and the service is always excellent.   Enoteca has everything I'm looking for in a restaurant: good ambiance, excellent service, reasonable prices, and delicious, comforting, interesting food. I eat here often - solo, on dates, or with friends - and it's good every time. No complaints."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are big fans of italian food so i typed in top 5 italian in toronto and this place was one of them. went in december of 2015 for my girlfriends birthday. we started with some pinot and i think i had some sort of merlot. then we had a appetizer with prosciutto, several local made cheeses with candied pecans and honey, was absolutely delicious! for pasta we had the gnocchi and yellow beat ravioli! delicious, simple and full of flavour! presentation was also very nice. For desert we had their sticky toffee pudding, wow what can i say it was delicious. The service was amazing and the waiter was very informative! $140 for the dinner"}
{"text":"A great restaurant with great service! Im not going to go too much into detail, but the food tasted great! The price was a little high for what you get, but then again the food came out really quick.  Didnt get to sample too much of the food, but I would love to come back again for sure. Wine was great and it paired well with the food.  Definitely should check it out!"}
{"text":"First off, our server was VERY attentive without being annoying about it, which to me is one of the best things. Made our experience a lot more enjoyable.  Food was good, had the chicken liver with grape spread and bread (very delicious). Bacon wrapped Cornish hen was also very tasty, the pickled mushrooms really added a beautifully paired flavor profile to the dish.  My friend had the cavallti  and let me have a taste, good but not to my particular liking but she thoroughly enjoyed it.  Capellatini was also a very good dish would recommend if you want to have a couple dishes but not too heavy of a entree. Overall great food and super great service !"}
{"text":"I've been reading about Enoteca Sociale in a whole bunch of places now, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I almost felt like it had way too much hype to live up to, but I went in with an open mind.  First of all, I was told to get a reservation.  I did hold an event there with 16 people, so ya, we reserved about a month in advance just in case.  However, through the night, we didn't find that it got busy until about 8:00pm.  The table of 6 beside us stayed open while we sat there the whole night.  Maybe it's just the day, but we went on a Sunday.  The first thing about this place you'll notice is the large wine list.  Don't know anything about wine (like me?), the servers know everything about the wines.  I was actually really impressed cause I had no idea... I just had my friend order me wine.  I was responsible for drinking it (I am really good at that).  We wanted to give the whole menu a shot, so we decided to split some apps.  We got the octopus as well as the \"rabbit stew for two\".  The octopus came out on a bed of red pepper puree and some fingerling potatoes.  It was kinda vinegar-ed with a bit of red wine, so it reminded me of squid you find at a salad bar.  The consistancy was very nice and wasn't incredibly chewy (you know... not like when you get octopus that feels like you're chewing a piece of rubber).  I thought this dish was so-so.  The rabbit stew was pretty interesting; I really liked it.  They served the rabbit in a tomato, celery, cumin based stew with fingerling potatoes in it and these little \"pasta pearls\".  I asked the waiter what the pearls were.  He replied (insert italian word here for the word I don't remember).  The little pasta balls were really interesting.  It's like fresh pasta, but, mini.  Kinda like bubble tea.  I liked how homey this stew felt.  Straight from nana's kitchen on the farm.  For the entree, I ordered the sausage pasta with (whatever the word for squid-ink pasta is).  I thought it was alright.  Not really mind blowing, but I have to say that the tomato sauce was pretty spot on.  The sausage was kinda hard and dry, so I didn't really like that part of it.   I also had the opportunity to pick off everyone's plate (it's not weird at all) and got to try some of the other entrees.  Here's what i found.  Gnocchi, awesome!  So incredibly fresh and soft.  Dried italian pasta, also awesome.  I loved the spicyness to it.  Lastly, we tried the toffee desert (forgot the name of it).  It was really good.  Basically it's bread pudding, with toffee, with ice cream on top.  It's win, win, win.  You can't really go wrong with that.  Amazing.  I probably would have ordered the dried italian pasta next time or the gnocchi.  Definitely give those a try.  Oh, and also more wine.  Yes... more wine."}
{"text":"This has been on my Food List for almost 2 years (if you don't have a food list, get your priorities straight). I went after spending a week in the Bahamas and I was really looking forward to some good pasta. Let's get one thing out of the way, service was great - I had at least 3 different servers pouring water, bringing over fresh bread and removing plates.   Moving on to the Pasta, we ordered 2 pasta dishes. The Cacio e Pepe & the Amatriciana. Now I know authentic pasta is supposed to be served Al Dente but this was taken to a whole other level, almost to a pain where I thought they may have undercooked it. That's what I didn't like, if it was cooked a bit more then I would have enjoyed it a bit more. That's just personal preference though.   What I liked was the simplicity of the dishes. The Cacio e Pepe was made with sheep's milk cheese and black pepper. Super simple, not too creamy or cheesy - really good. The Amatriciana has chili, tomato and some sort of bacon. Really simple. I actually combined the 2 of them and the Cacio really balanced out the tomato in the Amatriciana.   We obviously ordered dessert which was a Sticky Toffee Pudding with Ice Cream. It was very rich and sweet. I could only do 1-2 bites, because it was a bit overwhelming for me.   I would love to check out the cheese cave they have downstairs, and the cute little party room.    Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"delicious! I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars but since I would come back I'll round up. omg let me just start off with the free fresh bread. AMAZING. the bread was so soft and delicious. it comes with extra Virgin olive oil and since I'm not a super fan of it by itself we asked for some vinegar on the side. they weren't stingy about getting more too so that's always a plus.   for appetizers we got the chicken liver mousse and the pecorino sausage. omg both were so good. the mousse was just like pate, it came with a bunch of fat I'm assuming to keep it fresh so we scraped that part off and put it on some toasted bread. my only complaint was that I don't really like the burnt taste of bread it came with so I ate it with the free one however I know other people like the taste. the pecorino sausage was def my favorite! it sounds really lame but the flavor was just too good and something I've never tasted before so you MUST TRY.   onto the entrees: I was a little disappointed from hearing all the compliments about the pasta. I got the gnocchi and I actually really liked it however I also tried the lamb ragu pasta (idk what it's called) and that was just okay, there should've been more sauce since it was kind of bland. the pasta kind of looked like maggots (sorry really bad description but they did) and they were more on the tough/harder side. that was the only dish that came with meat so that's why most of my table ordered it. as for the gnocchi, I really enjoyed it. the sauce kind of tasted like a quality tomato bisque sauce and the gnocchi was soft. for the little portion of it was it actually filled me up.   overall, great quality restaurant! for being $$$ on yelp the prices weren't as bad as I expected since most of our dishes were in the $10-15 range. all I wish is thay there was more meat in the pasta dishes and there were more choices for pasta (although not that much more since I like the simplistic menu) DEF GET THE PECORINO SAUSAGE."}
{"text":"This place had fallen off my radar for awhile...shame. I visited a few years ago but I don't remember it being quite this awesome.  Our experience in July 2016 was fabulous...we enjoyed beautiful arancini, well-curated charcuterie, incredible spaghetti and truly excellent branzino.  How's that for congratulatory adjectives?  And even better, when a patio table became available mid-meal, they were more than happy to move our party of 7 outside. Service was lovely.  Add to all of the above an intimate, cool vibe...and friend, you have yourself a winner!"}
{"text":"Grilled Sausage with herbed ricotta and ramps - amazing. wow you have to try this. Arancini - very tasty Bone Marrow and Raw Beef - delicious if slightly underseasoned Agnolotti with Fava Beans and Preserved Lemon - this was my favorite dish. the sauce paired with the agnolotti was velvety and delicious rigatoni with braised rabbit - my fiance's favorite. lovely to share the two chocolate terrine with hazelnuts, olive oil, and sea salt - what a great way to end a delicous meal with a dessert that isn't too sweet.  all capped off by a fantastic bottle of Langhe Nebbiolo. I have never tried this grape before, but our server/sommelier-in-training made an excellent recommendation."}
{"text":"honestly...everything I put in my mouth was delicious. Server was super cool and the patio was pppperrrfect!!!!! there is a reason why this place has such great reviews! it deserves it!"}
{"text":"A nice dinner for two with a bottle of wine, for $200... not bad.  The menu is small, but they make everything as you desire and is spot on. I'd say the food is average good. I'm pretty picky, as I can make pasta -- so how magical will pasta be. But the sauces and methods of preparation show care and distinct methods of preparation.  The scene is busy with a lot of talk amongst people, which gives a good vibe. You'll need reservations, as this place really fills up. The wait staff is professional and very attentive, which is nice to see in a restaurant of this size.  I'd come back, but doubt anytime soon, with so many other restaurants to consider."}
{"text":"Good things about this place:  Amazing wine list, though expensive  Amazing pasta  Really good service  Nice family ambience- I wouldn't go here for an anniversary again  Price point  Things that are not so good:  Cheese and salami plates far too big for 2 people- they should adjust the quantity to group size. It was served 1st and we ended up eating so much we barely ate the rest of our meal.   Pate- very strange altogether- consistency, lamb?    I would go back for a family meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best pasta dish I have had outside of Italy. After reading in Toronto Life that Enoteca's house ravioli with brown butter was one of the best dishes in the city, I had high standards going in. And it delivered.  I admit my dining companions were not as equally impressed with their choices (hello, do more research folks!), but they agreed it was an all around good dining experience.   We started with the fried risotto balls (a must) and paired our meals with the suggested wines. It's a cozy place with hearty Italian offerings - what more could you ask for on a chilly autumn evening?"}
{"text":"Was looking for a moderately priced resto for a special occasion without breaking the bank and found this one. It was definitely worth it.  We ordered one of the deep fried cheese balls and the bone marrow and raw beef appetizer. The cheese ball was tasty with a crispy outside in a tomato sauce. The bone marrow with the raw beef was perfect on the crostini. The right touch of balance, just wish there was an extra crostini.  The mains we got were the rabbit rigatoni, the spaghetti w/ clams and sausage, and one vegetarian dish, the agnolotti. The rigatoni was excellent with the rabbit perfectly cooked and the currants added a nice sweetness to rich sauce. The clams were fresh in the spaghetti albeit a little too buttery (although this is typical of eating out anywhere). The agnolotti was light and refreshing with the herbs.  On top of the food, the service was impeccable. Great prices, good food, top notch service."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Toronto, I've been trying to find a replacement for some of our favorite Italian spots in New York like Malatesta, Morandi, and Babbo - this means quaint, unpretentious, knowledgeable, fantastic food, and a great wine selection.  Well, Enoteca Sociale is almost there, and I'm a big fan!    We walked in without a reservation around 7:30 on a Sunday evening, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  They sat us right away at the bar.  I was immediately impressed with the server/bartender's knowledge of the wine and food, and he was social and welcoming.  To drink we had a glass of the pinot noir and a barbera, which were both good.  For dinner we LOVED the beets with arugula, balsamic reduction, and stracciatella - what a fantastic combination.  For a main I had the tubettone with cauliflower, roasted garlic, and chickpea, which was one of the most unique and tasty dishes I've ever tasted.  For dessert, I was pleasantly surprised that they carry an Italian digestif that I love called Amaro Nonino, and I still day dream about the chocolate budino with sea salt and olive oil!   Pros:  Service, wine selection, food, unpretentious, decor, good vibe Cons:  Lighting is too bright - needs to dim down for atmosphere  It really does feel like a Real Italian Wine Bar, and I'd recommend it to anyone.  Can't wait to get back especially when we can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"\"Wow, that beef tongue is amazing!\" is something I never thought I would say.  Most of my prior lingual-eating experience has been choking down a thick piece of sad, over-boiled tongue at a Jewish deli and regretting my adventurous eating.  Enoteca Sociale, however, blew me away with a thinly-slide and grilled beef tongue served with an accompaniment of sous vide peaches and jalapeno.  The sweetness of the peaches and the slight spiciness of the jalapenos overlaid their flavors nicely with the expertly-cooked beef tongue.  This adventure really paid off.  Our group of 4 had 3 \"piatti sociale\", moderately-sized and priced appetizers and 3 pasta dishes and were very pleasantly filled.  The raw kale salad with wheat berries was nice and refreshing.  The pasta highlight of the night was a fall squash anolini, little pillows of pasta-goodness.  The real highlight were pickled chanterelles that accompanied the anolini and provided a little acidity to cut through the richness of the squash.  As the server put it, the size of the pasta dishes is \"reserved\", but they're priced appropriately for housemade pasta.    The service was attentive without being obsequious or intrusive.  Alas, we didn't make it to the dessert menu.  So far, this is definitely the best Italian that I or my 3 friends have had in Toronto, delivered at a reasonable price for the quality."}
{"text":"Geez. What to say other than I have really loved both meals that I have had here. There will definitely be more.  The pasta dishes are flavourful and perfectly cooked. The rabbit rigatoni is really delicious, as is the tuna appetizer with olives. Their basic green salad is one of the freshest, most tasty salads I have had.  Service here is very good. Things can get a bit hectic, as tables are spaced closely together, but servers seem to navigate well. On both visits everything from the timing of the ordering process, water refills, to receiving the check were spot on.  While the food is definitely the reason to come here and come back, Enoteca also has a warm, casual vibe that is all its own. It doesn't feel like a restaurant that is trying to be something (cool, hip, modern, trendy or whatever). It is simply itself and doing that quite well."}
{"text":"4.5/5.   If this place were *slightly* more affordable, I'd give it a perfect score. My friend and I shared the arancini, chicken liver mousse, rapini, and one of the soft cheeses. As my main I got the squid ink bigoli while she had the tagliatelle. We were impressed with all of the appetizers and side dishes, though if I had to quibble the the arancini could've used more salt. Highlight would have to be the chicken liver mousse (::Homer Simpson drool::) My pasta dish was excellent: the mussels and anchovies were fresh and tasty without being overpoweringly \"fishy\", and the breadcrumbs added a very enjoyable crunch. Preserved tomatoes lent just the right notes of sweetness. Also was a fan of the robust Bierno red of which I had two glasses.   All in all, this is definitely one of the most satisfying dining experiences that you can have in the city without burning a huge hole in your wallet. The servers are friendly and don't hesitate to answer any questions you may have about the menu. The ambiance of the restaurant is also warm and inviting without feeling too staid--probaly the perfect place to bring a date. That exposed brick!"}
{"text":"OMG, I loved this restaurant! Had a lovely starter salad dressed to perfection; the Amatriciana Spaghetti--made with their own house pork--that was out of this world amazing; and the fish special, which was seasoned beautifully, though I didn't end up caring so much for this particular fish. The cocktails were quite good. First tried the shrub (which I usually love, but I wanted more oomph in this one) and then another specialty cocktail that had cucumber and lemon and was super summery refreshing. Dessert: mascarpone panna cotta with strawberry was beyond amazing. It had some shortbread cookie crumble type topping and transported me back to the UK. Felt like I was having a different version of a cream tea--absolutely reminiscent of clotted cream and strawberry jam on a scone. Hands down fave dessert whilst in Toronto--and a generous helping of it, served so charmingly in a jar. Loved the vibe and our waitress (Jody, I believe) was lovely. Fab place!"}
{"text":"What's wrong with Toronto?!?!  I haven't found a place yet that is worthy of more than 3 stars, except for Scaramouche!!!!!   The food at Enoteca Sociale was pretty good. The cheese plates to start with are very nice, with a great selection of fine cheeses that are accompanied with some yummy honey, scrumptous pecans, and a fruit compote...and some crisps.  Very nice.  The deep fried risotto ball was very yum, but nothing extra-ordinary.  Our main course, the rabbit tagliatele was very good...but again, nothing out of this world. It was a small portion, and the rabbit was tender and the pasta tasted very good, but the homemade pasta at the Veranda Osteria in Etobicoke is just as good.   The service on a Friday was SLOOOOWWWWW!  I was actually very unimpressed with the service and we ended up spending more time actually waiting for our food than we wanted to...surprising given that they should have moved faster to turn the tables!  Not sure why Toronto Life has named this one of the best new restaurants...but then again, haven't been too impressed with the fare in Toronto...yet.  Please, Toronto, surprise me!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good vibes and a cute little restaurant in a nice, quiet neighbourhood. We were seated very quickly with a reservation on a weekday evening and the service was excellent. I had the TAGLIATELLE pasta and I enjoyed every bite. One minor complaint I had was that the portion was very small but it's very worth the price. There's an outdoor patio too if you go in the summer."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan here. Had the grilled beef tongue two nights ago. It was delicious. Trece with spicy octopus and sausage was okay, I rathe have the butacini or the fettucine with chicken liver. Kale salad is always my go to but opted to try there carrots bomba with candy almond (wish it was served a bit warmer).   Totally disappointed by their sticky toffee pudding. I love their menu just none of their dessert.   Service was good as usual."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here on her birthday, this was our experience.  We started with the grilled octopus, which had a fantastic charred outside and tender meat within, thought slightly overcooked.  We then had the 6.oz pork shoulder, medium well served over a mushroom emulsion.  The dish was cooked perfectly, we were quite happy with this one.  For my main I had the Spaghetti with Bottarga which I had been very eager to try since its almost impossible to find this dish/buy bottarga alone.  I was quite disappointed, they were very stingy with the Bottarga and my pasta tasted more like your standard alfredo with rapini.  My girlfriend had the Lamba Paparadelle which was hearty, smokey and had tender, well seasoned hunks of lamb: a wholesome dish prepared well.  Overall, Enoteca remains overhyped in my books.  The food was good, but not spectacular.  I probably won't be going back, and definitely not for their Bottarga dish."}
{"text":"I don't think it could have been better. The cheese board was excellent, all the accompaniments made the three cheeses shine and were absolutely delicious on their own/with the awesome bread.   I got the gnocchi with smoked ricotta. Our server warned me that it was spicy, and I was a little disappointed when it wasn't at all spicy. I honestly think they may have forgotten the chillies or something. The smoked ricotta was amazing though and the gnocchi was cooked absolutely perfectly.   Another plus, I'm also not familiar with Italian wines at all, so I described the flavours I was looking for and my server recommended one that was exactly right."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  After years of hearing about how great this place was I was mildly disappointed in the food.  The service and atmosphere was great (though someone may have to explain to me how so many 20-somethings can afford to eat here), but one dish in particular ruined an otherwise good meal.  My wife and I started with arancini and the bread and oil was great.  Then the pasta with beets was my wife's favourite though rather el dente.  Lastly I had the rib eye, perfectly fatty with arugula and vinegar.  My wife had the fish (sea bass I think) and that's what ruined it.  Over cooked and over spiced and poorly filleted this was a huge letdown.  Especially since the online bio spoke of the chef specializing in seafood.  Enough to ruin an entire meal?  I wouldn't have thought so either but here we are."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I want to thank blogTO for suggesting this restaurant. It was on top of the list to go for birthday dinners. And thats just what we did, we went to celebrate my friends bday here.  The place is really cozy and cute. The lighting is soothing and it definitely has the feel of a more private and friendly place. Our waiter Patrick was amazing and even though the menu looks super confusing ( we dint know all the fancy italian names), he was super patient in explaining to us what all the ingredients meant.  I had called before to tell them its my friends bday so they promised me a candle with my dessert to wish her, which was super sweet of them.  Here's what we had: They served us complimentary Foccacia and Rosemary freshly baked bread and honestly it was the softest bread we had. We helped ourselves to two servings ( one of the few restaurants that were more than willing to offer us another serving of complimentary bread without scowling) For starters we all had arancini, so its a ball of risotto and mozarella. Its like a burst of flavour in your mouth especially with the tomato sauce base. For entre, I had the smoked spagetti, the pasta was definitely freshly made and there was homemade freshness and flavor to it.  My friends ordered the Bucatini and rigatoni but I would say that the quantities weren't that great. However everyone was happy with what they ordered and thanks to the bread we were quite satisfied.  Their sticky toffee pudding reminded how delectable this dessert can be when made properly.  The place felt like it belonged in Toronto's Little Italy.  Not for the touristy aspect of it but more for the look and feel of the restaurant as well as the mixture of Italian language   Overall, Enoteca Sociale is a great restaurant. (though difficult to pronounce) Fun fact of the day- Enoteca sociale means a wine bar. Just for people who were wondering :p"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd devour a platter of brussel sprouts and actually crave more, but that's Enoteca Sociale for you. I came here for a birthday dinner and was instantly impressed. The decor is simple yet warm, and our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful. The menu provides a suggested wine pairing with each meal, and the waiter took the time to help us decide exactly what flavours and meals we were going for that evening. I had the steak served medium-rare, and it was cooked to perfection. The cut was just thin enough to still taste all the perfect seasonings, and it was the ideal balance of savoury and spice. The brussel sprouts were carmelized without tasting like a candied vegetable; and roasted at the perfect consistency. I'm eager to return and see how the desserts fare."}
{"text":"Delicious from the house made breads down to dessert. Every bite was perfect. Try the squid ink pasta - they shell the mussels for you, and each bite is delightfully chewy and salty-savory. They also had one of the most perfect arancini I've had, crisp on the outside and delicate in the middle"}
{"text":"The good: I am not a big Italian food fan. But my buddy insisted on coming here (shout out to Sam), and boy was it a good recommendation. This place not only blew my mind, I rank it in my own foodie list as one of the top two places in Toronto to go to. For appetizers, I had the arancini (mozzarella balls), chicken liver mousse (sounds bad but it was my favourite dish because mixing the apple butter with the liver and the grilled bread is like a match make in heaven), and beef crudo. For the pasta I personally had the gnocchi, while the rest of my group had the linguini, bucatini, and I believe the triangoli. Their pastas were all good but that gnocchi was the best I have ever tried. It was soft with great great sauce. And finally, for the dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding... Mind you we were all full already, but we just had to open our stomachs more because that dessert was amazing!  The bad: nothing bad to note imo   The ugly: nothing ugly too :)  Neutral: great for dates, groups. Book in advanced because seating on weekdays can be packed too."}
{"text":"I love that Enoteca Sociale serves up real Italian portions in antipasti, primi, secondi in a casual setting and the food was great. Definitely recommend but my only concern was that their pasta was harder than most fresh made pasta and they were overcooked by 1 minute, cuz I prefer my pasta al dente."}
{"text":"Really wonderful home style Italian comfort food in a trendy Ossington type atmosphere. I've been here a couple of times, and it never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. My wife loves Italian food and specifically Tiramisu. So went here for both. Unfortunately they changed their menu last week and no Tiramisu and the desert we got was pretty bad (salty chocolate with olive oil!). But the food and service were both fantastic."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta is AMAZING. I came with my family - the gnocchi was like the fluffiest most delicious ever, the ravioli was amazing, the sea bass was PERFECTLY cooked, the homemade linguine in the puttanesca was awesome and the 2 appetizers we had (the grilled romaine and the meatballs) were AWESOMEEE  Definitely recommend Although it comes at a bit of a price"}
{"text":"My boyfriend made a reservation a couple weeks in advance for our anniversary there. Waiting for quite some time was worth it. We had a cellar room downstairs which was absolutely gorgeous, and created a very romantic atmosphere. They have a great selection of wines to satisfy even the biggest wine snob.  We ordered 5 cheeses formaggi platter, which was even though on the pricey side, was absolutely delicious.  As a main course I ordered 45 Day Dry-Aged Ontario Ribeye, which is always served medium rare, closer to the rare side, and is perfectly made. Juicy, flavourful, and well complimented by arugula salad.  Their Sticky Toffee Pudding is also worth trying.   Go out and try it for yourself =)"}
{"text":"I've had another amazing meal here. So good it warranted another review. Walking in again without a reservation - 3 for 3 on that! We were seated a lovely table along the wall for two. After ordering my favourite wine from their list - Barbera D'Alba - something...we heard they were out of the two pasta dishes that are most veggie/fish friendly I had to get out of my comfort zone and man was I happy I did!  My friend and I split the always delicious cauliflower appetizer - I don't know how to do it justice as it sounds so unexciting - cauliflower? Yes, it's amazing, just eat it. And the kale is a close second in my books, we shared that too.  We were there quite late so we opted to go for a third selection off the appetizer list as our mains. CF ordered the small but adequate pork shoulder and she said it was amazing. I opted for the albacore tuna crudo, meyer lemon, celery, rosemary & pepper and was blown away. It was simple but perfect - melt in your mouth tuna so lightly but perfectly dressed.   Another great meal at Enoteca! The menu changes and I see the pork shoulder has been replaced but that's just more reason to keep going and see what they have to offer next!"}
{"text":"My new go to Italian restaurant in Toronto.  Went on a Saturday night with a reservation for 6:00. By 6:30 the place was full even with the frigid temperature. Bread came to start. Two kinds, red flaked sourdough and I forget the other. They were both delicious and they refilled the bowl multiple times. The waitress mentioned they sell the bread Saturday afternoons FYI.  We both got a salad to start. Escarole and Apple with Bacon, Old Cheddar, and Pine Nut Dressing. And Pear and Fennel with Blue Cheese, Walnuts, and Celery. The escarole salad is bigger so if you are afraid of not feeling full get that. The dressing was also fabulous. The pear and fennel is more unique. It was fairly acidic to match the richness of the blue cheese. But each bite with the blue cheese was delish.  At this point in the meal I thought the restaurant was a solid 4 stars and I was pretty happy. But then we had our pasta dishes and they were absolutely perfect. They were cooked al dente and had a lot of flavour. What was most surprising was the nice amount of acidity in each dish despite there not being any tomato sauce. My girlfriend had the Agnolitti with Butternut Squash, Brown Butter, Hazelnuts and Parmigiano. I had the Tagliatelle with Shrimp, Treviso and Cream Crumbs. Rarely do I eat pasta at a restaurant and want to come back and try the other pasta dishes, but I felt that way here.  Some of the reviews said the food was too salty or they left feeling hungry. This was not the case for me. I would suggest you share an app, or get your own though. The service was also excellent. It's the kind of place that changes cutlery between courses. Go here if you want a fine Italian meal."}
{"text":"At the sheer mention of the name \"Enoteca Sociale\", my heart explodes with butterflies. Adorable little restaurant, with a no-frills menu and great quality food. Like any good restaurant, their menu changes with the seasons.  I love this place so much that I've tried all their seasonal menus and this review is long over due. My most recent favorite: arancini with 'nduja (you had me at 'nduja...mmm) squash angolotti with pickled wild mushrooms in a hazelnut pesto and their chocolate budino.  The only downfall, this place is packed... All.the.time. Definitely worth planning ahead and making a reservation."}
{"text":"Overall, this Italian resto in Little Portugal was a rustic, cozy, slightly cramped, & quite loud even on a Wednesday night.  Place was packed and probably one of the busiest places on that strip.  Service was unpretentious and timing was good.  Most things came at a good time, but mains did take longer, nothing outrageous.  Highlights: -  Arancini - delicious, sauce was good, but a tad too salty -  one of their cured meats, similar to Proscuitto - beautifully sliced, not too salty -  presentation of the charcuterie -  menu was short and sweet, not overly complicated -  service was good, not super friendly, but pleasant, efficient, unpretentious -  tons of Wine to choose from  Needs Improvement: -  I wished there was some description for the cheeses/meats that they were offering.  Menu just stated the name + where they were from.  We chose 2 cheeses/1 meat based on the servers recommendations and I don't think I would've picked one of the cheeses on its own if there was an actual description.  It was too strong/salty for my taste -  the marinara for the Arancini (see above) -  the texture of the spaghetti was too dense, not in an el dente way, but just a bit too heavy, not chewy -  despite me asking a lot of questions about the wine, no samples of wine were offered.  This is a standard in most restaurants with an extensive wine list.  If you enjoy wine with your meal, just ASK if you can try some before you commit to a $20/glass  Warning:  Restaurant is extremely loud, soo loud that there's really no point in carrying a conversation.  So not recommended for a first date...unless said date isn't very entertaining.  In that case, reserve some money for the vino!"}
{"text":"Big Fan! Had a great birthday dinner here. I've wanted to try here for a long time...I am a big fan of Libretto and an even bigger fan of Skin and Bones so I wanted to give Sociale a shot. Reserved on Open Table. We arrived about 25 mins early as we took transit from Etobicoke so we could both drink, but were seated right away. Great wine list that hits both Italy and Niagara. Lots of Tawse, so that gets a star from me.  We started with the salumi board, which was really good! 4 different types of meat, a smoked prosciutto that was dynamite!  I had the ribeye which was well cooked and thinly sliced. Loved the arugula salad on the side of it too, great steak for the birthday! Patti had the gnocchi, which had a spicy sausage ragu with it that she cleaned up!  The tiramisu was a neat dessert, served in a more pudding format that was also cleaned up!  No dessert for me, but enjoyed the coffee and wiiiiiine.  Happy birthday to me! :)"}
{"text":"I tried the Parmigiano Reggiano menu and I was both, pleased and amazed on how many and diverse ways they came up with to create dishes around this ingredient.  My wife is a pasta lover and she was also pleased with her selection.  I also liked the way the presented the dishes explaining how they used the ingredient.  On the down side, it is very hard to find a table during weekends and the menu is a bit short."}
{"text":"A great dinner from top to bottom. They have what looks to be an excellent wine list. I don't drink wine but that's no problem - they have Birra Moretti on tap. The cheese platter was excellent and similar to what I've had at their sister restaurant, Libretto. The bread in the constantly refilled basket, both the sourdough and the focaccia, was great and I appreciated them leaving an excellent bottle of olive oil at our table for dipping.  Then came the octopus. I've eaten a lot of cephalopods in my time, and this is best I have ever had. The tentacles were thick and meaty yet grilled to tender perfection. The sauce and potatoes matched it perfectly.   My main course was an apple ravioli with black truffle shavings. It was, like everything else, excellent. For those used to monstrous East Side Mario's style portions the pasta dished might seem small, but in the flow of a multi-course meal they were a perfect fit.  When they came to take my plates, every drop of sauce had been mopped clean with bread. I didn't want even a speck of this food to go to waste.  We finished our meal with a perfectly made panna cotta and I had an corretto with a hefty splash of grappa. This was truly an excellent meal."}
{"text":"\"The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls\" - Pablo Picasso  Food has a strong connection to art. Similar to how an artist cannot truly appreciate the extent of Mona Lisa's smile until he is standing in front of the canvas in the Louvre; one cannot appreciate the extent of the artistic value of this restaurant unless one has tasted their gnocchi.   Whether it'd be from your failed aspirations, disappointing child, or short comings... food from this restaurant will definitely wash away the dust off your soul.  Their food is satisfying to the tongue. Sauces on their pasta are fresh and bold, with just the right amount of garlic and butter. Their gnocchi will literally melt in your mouth. Their cured meat collections are forged from nectar of the gods. Service is sublime and prompt. Their breads are soft and fluffy, you could probably use a loaf as a pillow.  The rustic environment that this restaurant provides allows a sense of romance and comfort. You could potentially bring your Tinder date here, but only if you are willing to spend minimum of $150 for dinner (mains only) for two. Perhaps its easier to subscribe to Netflix instead."}
{"text":"Service  Food  Dolce  I went with my girlfriends, we had the raw tuna, mushroom bruschetta, bucatini, caramel dessert and chocolate dessert. Every bite from start to finish was perfect. Even the bread was amazing, light, fluffy and airy, dipped in a soft, smooth, light olive oil, brought feelings of sleeping in my bed, so comfortable and familiar. My girlfriends are not raw anything type of girls, but I pushed them to try it, the looks on their face with their first bites were priceless; you could see their brains working with the taste receptors, \"I know I don't like raw food, but hello, where did you come from?\" The tuna was fresh, meaty, melted in your mouth with the freshness of the mint and taste of the sea, taking me back to my days in Rapallo where I ate copious amount of fresh fish. The mushroom bruschetta, overflowing with mushrooms (yes!). The first bite, toasted bread with beautiful silky butter melted deep inside, coupled with the smooth and strong mushrooms made me put my elbow on the table, close my eyes and just...enjoy. The pasta, fresh, handmade, a perfect al dente, with a simple tomato sauce and pork that tasted like nice thick cut bacon that has been fried to a crispy perfection, was light and made just how Italians actually eat pasta, fresh, simple with minimal ingredients. Lastly, the dessert (sticky toffee pudding and chocolate), you need to share with friends and try both. The explosion in my mouth was something that hasn't existed with a dessert in some time. So rich, so sweet, so creamy, so loving.   Next time I will be trying the Cacio e Pepe. It is a must try from what my foodie friends have told me. It is a typical dish of Rome and we are lucky to have it in our city.   Thank you Enoteca, bravo ragazzi, bravo!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! I came here for a birthday dinner and I was not disappointed. The food and service were great! We started with the beef crudo and thought it was the best I've ever had. I haven't had a lot of  experience eating raw beef but this one was definitely the best one so far. For mains, we had the rigatoni and smoked spaghetti. The rigatoni tasted great (bone marrow was very tasty) and would definitely have that again. For dessert, we had the sticky toffee. That was really good. I also ordered an espresso...they made great espresso!  The waitress we got was super friendly and had great recommendations. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Amazing! Marvellous! Orgasmic! All of those rolled in to one.  We've been on two occasions and loved it both times.  On our last visit we arranged for the \"family feast\" option for a birthday party and were not disappointed in the least.  Service has been great on both visits as well! One of the best dining experiences in Toronto in recent memory."}
{"text":"Excellent food (pasta!!), service and atmosphere. My only wish is that the portion sizes were a bit larger.  There are too many Italian restaurants with mediocre food. This is not one of those places.  This place also has a great side patio.  Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in an Italian household with no shortage of delicious, traditional Italian cuisine it can be a daunting task to be truly taken back by an Italian restaurant. Enoteca certainly didn't blow me away in that regard. The menu choices were fairly limited but we made due with the available choices and opted for the arancini, the beef crudo, spaghetti amatriciana and the branzino. The beef crudo was very tasty, fresh and well-balanced, but I found the arancini fell a little short. They were slightly overcooked and the sauce was overly salty, and relative to the price I thought I'd be getting rice balls that might be a paradigm shift. The pasta was excellent, perfectly cooked and in a wonderful, rich and flavourful sauce. I was a little disappointed in the branzino. It was a small fillet that was covered in a tomato based sauce which really overpowered the flavour of the fish, not to mention I was expecting a whole fish instead of a fillet. Overall this place makes some pretty good Italian food, I would've just liked a little more variety and portion size."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a nice dinner on a Friday night. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great - it's very traditional taverny, with dim lighting and an amazing bar. We had a cheese board to start, which was absolutely phenomenal. It came with 3 cheeses, preserves, meats and delicious bread. We had the steak, which was cooked perfectly, as well as a rabbit pasta dish that was so hearty and satisfying. It was like a very well seasoned italian stew. We also had the tiramisu for dessert, which was unbelievable (seriously - get this!). The whole experience was really great, the wait staff was amazing - great suggestions and attentive without being annoying. The menu is a little small but you won't be disappointed with the traditional Italian fare."}
{"text":"The first time I attended Enoteca Sociale I came in with a bias. I entered the restaurant thinking that it was going to be part of the ever-growing \"Toronto Hipster\" restaurant movement, which usually consists of extremely high priced foods, small portions and flavors that tends to be underwhelming. I had recently adopted this grim position on the Toronto food scene after a couple bad experiences, so I had no reason to believe this was going to be any different. Upon entry through the curtain and in to the restaurant, I was immediately immersed in the smells of Italy. The restaurant was quaint, warm (which was nice because it was winter) and most of all inviting. The ambience was perfect for the occasion which further intrigued me to taste their typically Roman menu. My brother had been here before and so I trusted him to order everything while I just sat back and drank my wine.  We ordered the Gnocchi with tomato sauce, chili and smoked ricotta, the 50-day ribeye with arugula and the Cacio E Pepe. When they arrived at the table I was thrilled to see that these pastas looked just like those I have seen in Italy. Now I am a harsh critic on pasta because it is one of my favorite foods but besides that it is the food I was raised on and the food I have eaten the most in my life, henceforth, I have no patience for bad pasta. THIS WAS NOT THAT! I took my first bite of gnocchi and immediately knew this was of a higher tier than any I have tried in Toronto. Before saying anything to my brother who was awaiting my response, I got up from the table and went right to the kitchen. I asked to speak to the chef and thanked him for what he was doing for this city (Bringing amazing, authentic flavors of Italy to Toronto). Each consecutive bite kept getting better and better, and I mean it when I say that the dressing on top of the arugula that accompanies the steak is unmatched. I would like to say that it was my favorite part of the entire meal, however, each course provided a unique flavor profile that added to the experience of the meal. I cannot wait to return to Enoteca Sociale when I go home for the summer, that is, if I can get a table. Chef Rindinella, thank you for being such an inspiration for chefs who just wish to make good food that reflect their roots, at a reasonable price. I will see you very, very soon."}
{"text":"From the Albacore Tuna Conserva to the 45 day old Rib Steak with 10 year old Balsamic to the Apple Cider Sorbet and everything we shared, I truly enjoyed this experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious Italian place. It was one of my friend's birthday and we had reserved a table downstairs in the winery. I loved how private and unique it was! (Please see pictures below)   I have to say I was impressed by both the place and the food. Every dish was unique and very authentic. At times during the meal, I wished I was raised by an Italian family. Their charcuterie board was quite nice with a variety of cheeses and meats. I thoroughly enjoyed their freshly made pasta and the home made sauce was just unbelievably good. The atmosphere was just simply perfect.   Really enjoyed the experience! A bit expensive, but would definitely recommend people to come if they want to enjoy good and authentic Italian food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Private dining rooming the wine cellar is really cute. The $50 tasting menu family style has more than enough food for everyone. Most memorable dishes include the tuna salad, caramelized pecan and the spicy pasta dish. The toffee cake is good too if you like sweet sweet dessert. The wine list is good too but not all are in stock."}
{"text":"Simple, freshly prepared, and well executed. Basically the experience I've come to expect when dining here. The customer service is always on point, and their knowledge of the menu is fantastic.  I've been here a handful of times now, mostly with clients. Very recently, I decided to take my sisters, and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience.   Pastas are all freshly made in house, with a focus on quality ingredients. Portions are a little on the smaller side, but exceptional nevertheless.   Cheese and charcuterie plates were average, but do appreciate the use of local products throughout the offerings. One small thing I'd like to see is a change up in variety - it's been the same options each time I've ordered.   If dessert is your thing, sticky toffee or Tiramisu is very good!    Pro Tip#981: For larger groups, try booking their private room downstairs in the cellar for a more intimate experience."}
{"text":"Terrible slow service. We had great food but the service was not very good at all. Apps came before drinks, server needed constant reminder to refill water and wine, main course came 30 mins after apps were cleared.   Disappointing experience from what we were expecting"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place since we had hear really great things from a few people.  We got seated very quickly and our server was the loveliest person ever and took time to take us through the menu and help make some recommendations.   We decided on the arancini balls, kale salad, cacio e pepe and the tomato based pasta with chilis.  We had heard some amazing things about the cacio e pep and were quite excited for it. When it arrived, we had our first bite and were shocked.  It was so salty, like putting a spoonful of salt into your mouth.  We weren't sure it that was normal so asked the server, she said the cheese was a saltier one but sometimes it is more salty than usual.  We wanted to love it but couldn't eat it.  Our server took it off for us which we were really grateful for.  It was probably an off day, but we were a little disappointed. They have a beautiful private room below that we'd love to do dinner with pals in the future"}
{"text":"We came to Enoteca Sociale for a friend's birthday dinner.  They had rented out the private room more affectionately known as The Cheese Cave.  It comfortably sat 12 people and had a window view to hanging house meats.  We were tempted by the many bottles of wine also stored in the Cave, just a few feet from our reach.  When we arrived, our hosts had preordered a few bottles of wine and a cheese/meat platter.  This was a great start as we all settled in.  Our waitress took drink orders and then came back around for our main orders.  I went with the salt cod & potato ravioli ($16) and also had a good sampling of the stinging nettle mezzaluna ($16).  The salt cod dish came with 2 jumbo raviolis stuffed with fish and potatoes, coated in a very stinky cheese (taleggio).  Delish.  The stinging nettle pasta was also good, much less stinky than my dish.  For dessert, I went with the sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream ($9).  Seriously, warm heaven in a cup.  Don't skip out on this dessert.  Temperature in the Cave fluctuated.  They had the AC on full blast to keep the wine cool but it was too cold for me.  Once they lowered the AC, it quickly got too warm for some of the gentlemen in our party.  Service was great.  We had a dedicated waitress and she kept wine glasses filled and drink orders coming.  We noticed that the main dining area was pretty busy and loud when we walked in.  The Cheese Cave allowed us to have a great time on our own.  It was a fantastic dining experience to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"I can say that this place serves the best pasta in town!!! Their Seafood Liguine was so out of the world.  Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Pasta here is quite good and the texture is perfect. Get their beef crudo to start off and their Cacio E Pepe cooked in a cheese wheel."}
{"text":"4.5 stars ... great restaurant and wonderful dishes.    Enoteca Sociale is on Canada's 100 best restaurant and so my curiousity about this place was peaked even more than before when that list was announced for 2017.  Enoteca would be my 6th restaurant from the list and after my Saturday early evening dinner, I can safely say it belongs there.  Service was polite and thoughtful to everyone including to a young family sitting nearby, food was delicious and incredibly well priced compared to other options in Toronto for the same level of detail and execution, and I loved the atmosphere.  We arrived early Saturday evening and was offered a choice of sitting inside or outseide.  The patio looked great and eventually was filled with many diners to enjoy the last bit of sun of the day.  We chose inside as we knew it might rain (still!) but we liked how the tables inside were nicely spaced out to not be sitting on your neighbour.  It was charming with a lot of warm natural light with well spaced tables and it was just the right level of music (aka.  you can definitely hear your friend) to not be distracting.  The music was fun and a bit hilarious... old school hip hop wasn't my first thought for Italian food but it made for moment where you had that look of \"OH wow... I heard this when I was in Grade 9!!\"  Loved the service here... between constantly checking in discretely, clearing plates and utensils for new ones between each dish, and filling water, it was clear they were a well polished group as they took care of the room seamless.  I wouldnt say everyone was friendly but definitely they care about how you felt about the meal and the experience.  The hostess and one particular young lady was just doting on the little kid at the next table and making thoughtful chit chat.  It was very nice to see they welcome everyone one ... regardless of how old they were.  Arancini - Something so simple looking and yet deliver a response of \"damn thats good\" after each bite.  Perfectly crispy shell housing tender rice grains with a generous molten core of gooey cheese awaits your every bite... add the nicely spiced tomato sauce that gives your tongue a bit of heat and you got yourself one of the best arancini I've had in Toronto and rivaling some of the best I've had from my travels.  5/5  Cacio e Pepe - I debate going between a 3.5 to 4... the sauce was a gorgeous creamy texture that held its wonderful texture for quite a while but the black pepper taste was a bit subdued.  You can taste it as a lingering note at the end of the bite.  I've had it far more aggressively peppered in Italy but that doesnt mean this version is bad.  Pasta was just a touch past al dente but I dont like it too firm so it was perfect for me.  Though this was a cheese on cheese affair, it never felt too heavy and a nice portion to share as a primi 4/5  Amatriciana - The other primi was the amatriciana pasta and this was just amazing.  It was a bright tomato sauce with a touch of heat from chilis and slices of guanciale (nice pieces of pork neck that reminds you of bacon).  The pasta was a thicker version of spaghetti and so it had a bit more chew but it was cooked wonderfully so it wasn't mushy or firm.  Just right.  A definite winner.  5/5  Roast Chicken - For our secondi, we opted for the chicken and as someone mentioned \"I want more of this chicken skin.  What did they do to this... its like an addiction\".  It looks like they pan seared it before roasting the rest and it resulted in this incredibly crackly and flavourful chip like skin that was addicting.  The meat was tender, flavouful, and juicy so it was so easy to just tear the meat off the bones easily.  The only small note was that some pieces of the chicken was a tad bit oversalted but not all of it.  4/5  Rapini - Generous platter of deep green rapini ... i was pleasantly surprised on the size and thrilled!  I'm used to (unfortunately) receiving only 5 sprigs for $10 (True story... just ask Mark McEwan).  Generous pour of olive oil topped it off... perhaps a bit too generous but I know a lot of Italian nonnas just douse their vegetables this way.  Most of the rapini was fresh and perfectly cooked... once in a while though you come across a tougher and slightly 'woodier' one but its a small item  3.5/5  Green Bean - Another generous side where you have bright greens.  These are well cooked as they still retained their crunch while still just edging towards being tender.  Nicely spiced with salt and chilli flakes.  Great side to the chicken.  4/5   I really liked Enoteca Sociale especially for the price point.  With drinks and tips, it came out to be $45 per person and I know I've paid more for dishes that werent as flavourful or well executed.  I will definitely return especially knowing that the menu rotates seasonally."}
{"text":"Second time here and really enjoyed it again. Ate at the bar... all recommendations were good. Sticky toffee pudding is a must!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Had the Spaghetti with black pepper and pecorino cheese sauce...  and Semifreddo for dessert.... Both DELICIOUS!  Almost as good as what I ate in Italy last fall...  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMING AND PRETENTIOUS.  Overhyped and disappointing.  Service: 1/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 2/5 Quantity: 1/5 (portions are small)  To start, our server was snobby and pretentious. According to this too good for you snob, 75% of his clientèle \"trusts\" him and just asks him to bring food until they are full. Yeah right. Didnt know I stepped into a Michelin restaurant and am waited by the chef. He started out by going into extreme detail of the wine and when i was clearly not that interested, he got all snobby and started to ignore us, taking his sweet time to take our order, clearly believing that we were dining n00bs. I only tipped him 10% because I was pissed at his attitude, and he threw the receipt on the table and walked away without saying thank you or goodbye. Manners, much? You're lucky I didn't tip you a cent.  We got their crustini special for appetizer, with this salami like ham, house-made with pistachio and carrot. It was pretty good so in spite of the bad service, I figured I might be able to handle this place, but it went downhill from there.   For entrees, we ordered the ricotta and asparagus ravioli and the roasted spaghetti with clams. We asked the ravioli to be without parmasan cheese, and this crudely presented tiny portion of ravioli was covered with cheese. OOPS? The pasta itself was extremely thin and not del dente. The taste was mediocre. The spaghetti with clams was made with brown pasta and it was hard and chewy. The dish tasted like parsley and nothing else, quite unpalatable. Four clams and a small portion of noodles. Not filling at all.   The server didnt come to check up on our entree and when the busboy came to clear out table and asked us how it was, we both said it was \"alright\". The guy said, \"Just alright?\" and we said yes, and then he walked away.   Needless to say, despite we were still hungry, we opted out of dessert. Two drinks, one appetizer, and two entrees = $70 before tip. We were hungry. We went elsewhere for dessert. There's no reason for me to drop another $20 on mediocre expensive food with bad service."}
{"text":"Cozy place but crammed for space the apps were good but main dish very plain I won't be back but I wouldn't bash the place. Also they have no tea I was told its the Italian way weird !"}
{"text":"This place honestly deserves 6 stars. The most amazing plate of pasta, their Cacio e Pepe is my favourite comfort Italian food in the city. The place is all about the food, and the price is incredibly affordable. They also have some of my favourite bread!! Better than libretto :)"}
{"text":"blah. my overall feeling after dining here for my birthday dinner last week.  Maybe it was because I heard such good reviews of the place, maybe it was because I had pretty high expectations, and maybe because it was a celebration dinner, but I left the restaurant that night feeling very underwhelmed.  Booked a table for 2 Sunday evening (mentioned in the booking it as for a bday). When we arrived the place was empty minus another couple. We were seated in a corner near a window with a huge draft. In an almost empty restaurant it would have been nice it they placed us in a more cozy area.  Server was meh. Not rude, but didn't seem excited to be there or go out of her way to offer us any suggestions.   I wanted to order some of the dishes I had seen posted on yelp (smoked spaghetti was calling me!) but the menu changed and we had to wing it. We worked with what we had (tbh the current menu is pretty unexciting) and without the help of our unhelpful server, we decided on:  Complimentary - house made bread and olive oil. Both were to die for. Both were the best part of our meal.  Starter - mushroom bruschetta. Essentially a pile of meaty mushrooms on a thin slice of toasted bread, smeared with a very mild ricotta cheese. It was very good, but really it was just a plate of mushrooms.  Pasta - spaghetti with sheeps milk cheese and pepper. The portion small, the pepper super overpowering, and the dish incredibly salty. We were chugging water for the rest of the night. The taste was so overbearing and salty and peppery that we could barely finish the tiny portion.   Whole rainbow trout - fish was super tender, but thats about it. Very very tasteless fish, and since the fish is so mild they could have added some other tastes to the dish. But it doesn't come with sides, so it was just a big slab of tasteless (albeit very moist) fish.  Overall nothing special and definitely not the best choice for a special occasion meal. It says something when the free bread is the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Kind of funny to have an Italian place in little Portugal but I don't have any bad things to say. The arancini was delicious, wild boar and cheese platter was great. A lot of the food items here are very delicious and fresh. I could not get enough of the complimentary bread and olive oil. you must try the sticky toffee pudding. This is the most fair priced Italian restaurant I've been to in a long time."}
{"text":"An all around fantastic dinner service last night where everyone from the wait staff to the chefs actually have a clue about food, wine, and exceptional service. Flown in truffles from Croatia. seriously? no not the olive oil; the actual ugly looking fungus thing that smells like a billion bucks. I didnt know it was truffle season but certainly glad i was able to experience it.   highly recommend the white truffles over the homemade pasta at $42 for 5 grams, it's worth every penny.  Also the tiramisu not made from mascarpone is comparable to the all-mighty libretto tiramisu if not a level up.   This place is small and date friendly. it would be difficult to get that 7pm reservation unless booked in advance. The 9pm however you should be able to score same day."}
{"text":"Great pasta, desserts, wine selection. Always a busy, quality spot."}
{"text":"Toronto has such a plethora of eating establishments I had a hard time just picking one place to go.  I wanted a good meal without the high-end atmosphere and it appeared Enoteca Sociale fit the bill.  The house-made foccacia was a favorite all around - soft, moist, and chewy, not dry as it can be.  We had the sea bream, sausage, and arugula as our starter, and we liked it very much.  Even my mom, who I consider to be the ultimate chef on this planet, was very impressed by how the sea bream was pan-fried (almost like Asian-style) to perfection.  The sausage and arugula salad provided a nice balance to the fish.  Now the pastas are all made in house with a few expections.  I had the spicy octopus and sausage pasta while my brother got the pork and fava beam rigatoni and my mom was adventurous and went with the chicken liver fettuccini (well, given that we eat pork liver time to time, perhaps chicken liver isn't that adventurous to us Asians, hehe...).  The flavors were different for all three of our pastas, and we could definitely taste the quality of the house-made pasta.  My only quibble is that the portions were on the small side, so we had more of the foccacia to fill us up.  Nonetheless, a solid choice to enjoy some delicious Italian food.  On a side note, I made a reservation at 6 pm and there were only a few tables occupied when we arrived.  And when we were done, the place wasn't filled up.  I had asked for a later time, but they said they were all booked.  So it's a little odd, but perhaps that's how most restaurants operate nowadays.  Additionally, the restaurant is easy to get to on the 505 tram from the downtown area."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad and my boyfriend, people kept recommending it to me, everyone seems to love this place. I got the gnocchi, so good. They have lots of different pastas to choose from. Our server was really nice and really attentive and she kept making sure I had wine. The atmosphere is really nice, good lighting, good table spacing, lovely decor. It was bustling in there but not too loud for us to enjoy our conversation at all. It is inexpensive for the quality of food. Think the same prices as Terroni but at a better restaurant with better food."}
{"text":"Definitely the best meal I have had in a long time. Everything was spectacular. The food, wine and service. The arancini and the striploin with marrow is a must! Go here!"}
{"text":"Simple is good in Italian food and by first glimpse I can tell I am in for a treat. An extensive wine list and a choice of two beers, the alcohol is sufficient but I really came for the food.  The bread is perfect altought I'm unsure if it is made in house yet I   The deep fried mozzarella di buffala balls are crispy yet soft and the tomato sauce that accompanies is sweet with all the right favors.  The linguini with chicken livers was fresh, tasty and overall an excellent choice if you like liver. An espresso capped ended the night.  Overall an excellent meal. I would return. $68 for two plus tip"}
{"text":"ok lots of reviews on enoteca, i guess i am just throwing in my 2 cents, but here it goes. First off, Yelp should really either buy or merge with opentable, i downloaded the app on my BB and had rezzos for enoteca in under a minute, without any phone calls. its fucking awesome. yelp's blackberry app sucks (sorry, its true), you guys need to beef that sh*t up, foreal.   Onto the review, i was pretty happy i got the rezzo on my bb through opentable in under a minute, so that was just put me in an awesome mood. Looking over the menu, it looked pretty awesome, but missing a few of my favourite things about italian restaurants being carpaccio, either way i make due. few things here i didnt like to start, olive oil: too damn strong and bitter, im paleo so i barely eat bread but was famished so i did, and that olive oil tasted like ass, if i wanted to taste ass id have given my date a rimjob at the table, i didnt. And the cheese stuff, WTF, ya i like a good cheese but 7 bucks for a plate of 4 slices of cheese and burnt toast, (get the F outta here). give me some meat.   Grilled octopus: ive neve rhad octopus this FN good, it was unbelievable, it must have been braised for hours and then grilled because biting into that tentacle was the happiest time of adult life.   Oxtail: yes everybody says its good, when i had my first bite alongside the creamy polenta its served next to, i thought to myself: That is really, really , really f*n good, i mean thats why i work 80 hours a week, to eat some oxtail that good. holy F, it felt like my mouth was being bitch slapped with amazing flavour, it made it hard to swallow, i wanted it to last forever. kind of like a 3some with 2 girls way out of your league.   The cheese plate was ok, i mean once again nothing special, it was good cheese and slightly burnt toast.  We had these baccala thingies, ive never tried it before, its basically deep fried balls of cod, kinda salty, i dont like cod. looked nice but nothing special, the tripe ragu it came with was delish.  Another comment: im pretty sure my waitress (ya im sexist) was high on some strong blow, because she couldnt stop talking and pacing around the restaurant.  Dessert: apple crossada (i think tha twas the name) also delicious, it was like baked apples with some kind of crust alongside a whipped goat cheese+cream thingie, it was good.  All in all, I would def. come back, great place for a date or just a good ass dinner with your boys. I dont eat carbs so cant comment on the pasta but ive heard its great."}
{"text":"Getting a reservation at Enoteca Sociale is not easy.... even for my Saturday 10 pm table for one reservation had to made more than 2 weeks ahead. I really wondering how good this place is? Why so popular?  The restaurant itself is pretty small and intimate. It does feel like I am eating in a farm house somewhere in Italy. Noise level is deafening, I can hear all these chattering going on around me, at the end of the dinner I can even hear that in my head....  Enoteca Sociale is also one of those restaurants I would have come if I am on a diet. I would also come here if I am dining alone as sharing is not really necessary. The portion here is small.... really small........  House made pappardelle, Ontario lamb ragu, house smoked guanciale & pecorino ($18) was really really good. The freshly made pappardelle has this awesome texture and softness. The lamb ragu was rich and flavored. I was chewing and eating slowly....really slowly.....enjoying my every bite......................  Tiramisu ($8) accented with orange peel and preceso was a light twist to this classical dessert. Light and creamy at the same time.  My waitress is efficient but a little bite cold. My food was served quickly and plate removed right when I finished.... and I was in and out in 45 minute.  Will I come back? Maybe for the tastier menu, but I know what to expect... good food in small portion and pricey................"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, (obviously) great wine list. Get some cheese. Get some arancini. Get some pasta. (Can't vouch for the non-pasta mains.) Finish with sticky toffee pudding. Don't really know what else to say."}
{"text":"Great place for a date. Romantic/rustic decor and a small menu gives room for care in every dish.  The beef crudo was very fresh, soft, and seasoned wonderfully.   Very good arancini, hot gooey cheese inside a fine crisp shell.  The gnocchi was incredibly soft, sauce could use a little more oomph though.  The chicken liver pate alone was bitter but saved with the accompanying sweet jam.  We loved the panna cotta with rhubarb compote. It was very smooth and the cream dissolved in the mouth, followed by a rush of flavour from the compote."}
{"text":"In my humble but correct opinion, enoteca is slightly overhyped. Don't get me wrong - food is fantastic and service is outstanding, but for the price you pay, you could find better a better place. I shared 3 courses with a friend and a bottle of wine. Came to about $150. After dinner my friend asked for more bread (the bottle of wine hit us pretty hard) and the waiter's reaction was a snarky \"wow\". And I can understand being surprised by the request, but I felt that he was being condescending. It's too bad that this stands out in my memory of enoteca sociale. Decent place despite all this."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times since I moved to Toronto last summer.  It's my favourite Italian in the city. The people, the service, the flavours, they cannot be beat.   (The hostess also laughs at my jokes which is a huge plus)  For those trying Enoteca for the first time: HAVE THE CACIO E PEPE"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a Christmas work party with a group of seven at 5:30 in the evening on a Friday (reservations for any size group is probably best, obviously).   Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the wines and dishes, and helped our table pick out a white and a red. Her descriptions of the wines and dishes would make anyone salivate!   For starters we ordered the artisinal cheese and meat platters. At first the platters may seem small but are more than enough for a group of seven to share, including the wonderful rosemary bread they bring to the table.   For mains we each ordered a pasta dish. Oh man you have no idea about these pasta dishes!. The homemade pasta will make you question why you ever ate or thought boxed pasta was good! (says the person who will continue to eat boxed pasta because she still has student loans to pay off).   One of our group had only one criteria, something that was entirely vegan (the restaurant also has vegetarian options). The chef was entirely accommodating and the server came back with a potato gnocchi with mixed vegetables dish. It looked delicious and apparently was! I myself ordered Bucatini all'Amatriciana which was fantastic! The flavour of the cured meat that was cooked until crispy was the best part of every bite, and the tomato sauce had just the right about of spiciness/heat that it didn't overwhelm the dish.  In one word it was perfect.   For dessert they had a selection of sweet wines and coffee. I ordered the eggnog tiramisu, which was the only thing I found disappointing out of the whole evening. The ladyfingers used in the dessert were drenched in coffee (espresso?) so much so that they were mush and  it left a layer of liquid at the bottom of the jar the dessert came with an overpowering taste of coffee. But this is such a minor thing compared to everything else!  Enoteca Sociale is definitely a place with fantastic food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"In-house cheese cave? Go on... Other noteworthy offerings from this trendy Parkdale resto: a commitment to local fare, a Enomatic wine dispenser behind the counter to serve a hefty selection of bottles by the glass, and a totally relaxed atmosphere that will make you feel at home.  All these factors drew me to this West End spot. It's owned by the Pizzeria Libretto crew and is just as popular (that is, very). Walking in sans reso on a Friday night, we were told to expect an hour wait. The mustachioed Italian Food Gods (IFGs) must have been smiling that night as ten minutes later my cellphone was buzzing.  Enoteca is a pastoral kind of place, terra cotta floors, brick walls painted white, dim lighting and wall art by California-based Retrowhale. This is a place to bring a date, or have a relaxed meal with friends. Nothing terribly stuffy or formal about it, which I like.  The menu is large and very Italian (filled with ONOs, ANOs and ELLAs), but (not having an Italian grandmother of my own) I felt obliged to order the $45 prix fixe \"nonna's dinner\" which is features a sample of their menu options. I skipped the optional wine pairing with each course, but instead got stuffed on their fantastic and authentic Italian offerings. I'm not going to bother telling you what I ate: go there and discover it for yourself. This place is just that good.  Obligatory Title Pun: I wENO a TECA-nical school to get a SOCIALE-ogy degree.  Menu Readability: Pretty gorgeous.  Need to mention: Make a reservation.  What this place teaches me about myself: Who's down with IFG? (Yeah, you know: me.)"}
{"text":"I booked a reservation here for a friends birthday. There were 7 of us and we sat up on a high top table. I wasn't overly familiar with their menu other than it was an Italian restaurant.   I was definitely blown away and very impressed with the menu options and the food itself. Every plate that came out was amazing, I don't think I had one item I didn't like.   I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I have had the fortunate luck to have been taken here for 2 birthdays in a row.  Last year i had the pleasure of partaking in the tasting menu, with a wine pairing with each course...sadly to say i don't remember much...except that it was delicious...and that the wines are amazing! Fast forward to this year, my friend and i shared the Grilled Octopus and Potato app -  wow!!!!  Tender, meaty tentacles paired with perfect potatoes...you will not regret this!  For my main, i got the house made spaghetti with prawns, rapini and chili - their pasta here is perfectly made, perfectly el dente, sauce was perfect and the chili was the right amount of kick. My friend got the pappardelle with lamb ragu, another winner.  Tasty and hearty.  A warning to the hungry, these pasta portions are not very big but what they lack in size they make up in quality and taste.  If you are having a hard time making reservations (at a normal time, 10pm is always available!), Enoteca does reserve some spots for walk ins. We gave them our number and had a few drinks at Churchill down the block, took about 45 mins on a Thursday which is not too bad.  Another great thing is their extensive wine list.  I didn't get to try the dessert but i do know that i've got to come back and try more of this menu!   Believe the hype!"}
{"text":"I went for an anniversary. We had no problem getting a table on a Friday night at 7 Actually it was kinda empty when we got there. By the time we left, it was packed!  Decor is simple, not trendy, and seemingly family friendly since we saw more than a few inter-generational families there  Actually really reasonable for the amount of food you get, very generous portions, great for sharing. The meat / deli plate was really good. The spaghetti was also really good. Extensive wine list."}
{"text":"Stick with the appetizers and skip the pasta until they stop oversalting it.  Get the beef tartare, rabbit terrine, and arancini. All prepared perfectly and delicious.   The pasta that we had was all super salty. The pasta is fresh made and the texture is great, but they were very heavy handed on the salt. The garganelli was cooked perfectly and would have been amazing if it weren't so damn salty! The cacio e pepe was so salty we had to send it back. We couldn't even force ourselves to eat it. The squid ink pasta did not stray from the salty pattern.   Maybe let them know that you want low sodium pasta, then it will be amazing."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the Summer Harvest Menu, which was a great value ($35) for a 4 course meal.  The Arugula with Crispy Veal Sweetbreads were good, crispy and slightly heavy but were offset by the bitterness of the arugula and lemony olive oil dressing.  My friend ordered the Marinated Anchovies Ontario Buffalo Mozzarella.  Really yummy, perfectly seasoned and the textures complemented each other well.    Both of us ordered the spaghetti Cacio e Pepe which was good, albeit somewhat plain.  I thought it was nothing to write home about, although the noodles were very fresh.    The Cornish Hen was also quite good, although with an unexpected texture.  Although moist, it had the texture of pork tenderloin rather than the Cornish hen that i'm used to.  Wasn't sure how much I liked this dish, the pepperonata underneath the Cornish hen also didn't seem to do much for the dish - slightly limp but added some much-needed vegetables.    The desserts were also not bad.  The ricotta cheesecake with the Ontario cherries were great (love the stewed cherries!) and the \"cheesecake\" part had the texture of panna cotta, and I love panna cotta, so of course I was a huge fan.    However the flourless chocolate cake had the consistency of a dense and dry brownie, although they tried to offset that with the whipped marscapone and orange rind.  I was expecting something more lava cake-y, like the flourless chocolate cake they have at Terroni.  All in all, good but somewhat underwhelming given all the breathless reviews.  It is a good addition to the neighbourhood, and they have a great wine selection.  And something else - although the staff was nice, I kept suspecting that the restaurant was trying to show how sophisticated/authentic they were by renaming some pasta classics.  For example, ravioli was suddenly raviolo?  Hmmmm.  In any case, great date place, and great patio."}
{"text":"Reco from a friend. Have always been searching for that pasta dish that tastes just like it does in Italy....  I'd say they definately have very good pastas. Homemade and that density that I like, and cooked al dente. We had the bucatini and the capelletti. Both were great tasting. I particularly liked the capelletti because the flavors went well together - jalepenio oil and corn and cheese, and they were not the usual flavors for a pasta dish. The presentation looked pretty but there were about only 8 small pieces spread out on the plate - dont have this if you are super hungry.  The bucatini pasta was good though, I cant say anything in the sauce stood out for me, but was still liked. BUT the added guanciale (like fried cured pork) I think really made the dish, more of it would have been great.  Oh and as mentioned in other reviews: The bread. YUm and soft with great crust.  The strawberry cocktail was sweet and refreshing.   I'd go back again to try the other pastas and maybe the Toffee pudding everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice, and I can say that I will go back there soon. The first time, I got their 3 course set summer menu. My selections must've been pretty good, because I LOVED the food. I got the zuchhini blossoms, bucatini and the cheese platter. The bucatini was beyond excellent. I can still taste it, I liked it so much I asked the server for the recipe (which they readily gave btw).  The second time I went here, I got the gnocchi. It was very good, but not as good as the bucatini (in my humble opinion). Needless to say, you won't be disappointed here. It is slightly on the expensive side, but you're paying for great food, great service and good ambiance!"}
{"text":"You can book a cheese cellar here for private events.  The above statement is enough to garner this place five sexy stars without hesitation.   Enoteca Sociale is some of the best Italian food I've had in Toronto. I went in with a colleague and we started with some whiskey cocktails, red wine and their fabulous house made bread. I had the rigatoni with red-wine braised beef. The meat was soft and exquisite. The portion initially seemed small, and I knew I was going to want more but I was perfectly full at the end. We over serve pasta on this side of the pond, and this place keeps it real.   It's definitely a date night kind of place, and I'll bring my sweetie back here. Not that I didn't have a lovely candlelit meal with Yelp's Biz Outreach manager... I just recommend this joint for couples over colleagues.   You can book a cheese cellar here for private events."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian places in the city. They have great options for salads, cheese, and awesome Italian food. Coffee and deserts are real good as well. To top it off the ambiance is great and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Enoteca Sociale a few days ago for the hubby's bday dinner. I love the inside decor. It has a romantic rustic feel to it. They also have a nice patio area for those beautiful spring/summer days.   Service was good and efficient. My hubby felt our waiter had no personality and was pretty expressionless while taking our orders. There's just something about a waiter or waitress with a sunny disposition that just makes the meal that much greater and this is probably the only reason this place is getting a 4.   Now on to the food! We had the Arancini, Beet Salad, Carbonara and the Ontario Ribeye. The Arancini was delicious, one of the best one's in the city. Only drawback, you get one the size of a golf ball for 4 bucks. You will definitely need to order more than one if you are dining with a group of 2 or more. The beet salad was very simple but because of that, incredibly refreshing and you really got the taste of beet in the salad without it being diluted by too much of other ingredients. The Carbonara was perfect. Not too creamy or over the top rich. I love guanciale so the addition of that to the pasta was just perfection.  We also had the ribeye. It is cooked on the rare side and they don't ask you how you want it, so if you order it make sure to let them know you want it more cooked if rarer pieces of meat are not your jam.  The meat was very nice and quite tasty and is served with a simple kale salad. We skipped out on dessert since we were so full already but all in all, a solid Italian meal without disappointment."}
{"text":"This was simply the best dish of pasta I've ever eaten. Their mezzaluna raviolis had the perfect texture, delicious filling and most amazing sauce (burnt walnut pesto and lemon). Just incredible. I had to finish the sauce with bread and my plate was as clean as it gets.  Other reasons you should go there (if you need any): The service was great, our server was fun and super attentive to us, the ambiance is perfect, with dimmed light and very cute decoration. In good Italian tradition, they brought us bread right away, accompanied by little saucers of olive oil. Be careful there, the more bread you eat, the less space you will have for their amazing pasta.   My husband had the chili gnocchi and also really liked it, but the mezzalunas were definitely the winners of the table. Friends who go regularly also recommend the Aranzini ball as a must for appetizers. The portions are also reasonable, which I really appreciate at a pasta restaurant.  In summary, just go there. It's amazingly good and the prices are very reasonable. You will not regret it!"}
