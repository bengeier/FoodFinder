{"text":"This place is amazing! The location is kind of hidden but it is worth the hunt. We went for the half price bottles on Tuesday and ordered some appetizers to go with it. The hummus is superb and so is the service! We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and so is the service. If you have not tried this restaurant yet, you definitely should. The smoked salmon starter was one of the best dishes I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I sent the wine back for the first time in my life--it was muddy and long past ripe!  Bruschetta was more like garlic toast and soggy --- entree bland and there is a fine line between good service and being intrusive.  Not a good value and constantly interrupted."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for date night. The service was not great at all. There were only 3 tables seated when we arrived and our server disappeared leaving the hostess to take and deliver our drink order and order and deliver our food. The food was nothing special either. Of course our server finally showed up to deliver the bill. There are so many options in the area, not worth giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"The following happened:
- The onion soup was sweet water with onions - Not Hot 
- Cob Salad was not more than a dinner salads with some garnish  
- We requested a sample of $8.00 wine they substituted it with a $22.00 a glass - after we ordered it 
- The restaurant was cold needed a jacket 
- The restaurant was nearly empty and not cheap 
- Other restaurant in the area where full 

The other restaurants  are very good"}
{"text":"Just discovered Grape this past weekend. Had a fantastic meal and the scallops were amazing. Wine and service were equally amazing. Really enjoyed the Jazz band and will be back to Grape very soon."}
{"text":"I just can't rate this place above a 3, both our main dishes were nothing that we would come back for, very bland.  However,  I will say this the Brushetta was amazing. In addition the wine list is overpriced even for scottsdale.  
In regards to the wait staff was very good, it would have been nice if we could say that about our main entrees.."}
{"text":"We tried Grape tonight for the first time. We got there at 5:30 and we had to ask if Happy Hour was in effect. We ordered glasses of wine and then some \"appetizers\" that we assumed were part of happy hour (they were not). It took at least 30 minutes before the two bruschettas and one cheese plate were delivered. As soon as these were served, we ordered dinner explaining we had 7:30 concert tickets. Another 30 minutes before our dinners were served. Didn't leave until 7:25. 

The food was very good - two chicken roulades, one scallops, one Caesar salad with filet mignon (without the anchovies I requested). 

Good food didn't make up for the extended waits."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely assortment of choices for dinner - Three of us ordered different things and we all tasted... lamb shanks, salmon and Dover Sole were all very good.  We had some warm olives to start.  Nice wine selection - prices reasonable too.  I'd go back for sure.  Our server was knowledgeable and fun."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday with my husband and 2 friends.  We have eaten here about 4 times in the past several years (it was previously called \"Rock & Vine).\"  It has always been very good and yesterday was no exception.

We ate inside, although the patio looked lovely.  I probably should have taken some photos as the dishes are plated so beautifully.  I had the salmon salad sandwich, husband had the cobb salad, and friends had the portobello sandwich and the gourmet grilled cheese sandwich.  Everything was excellent.  Great ice tea, too!

No complaints from me except I wish it was a little closer to our home so we could go more often.  The service was great, too!"}
{"text":"Sorry to be late in writing this review -- I hate to think of anybody with any semblance of a palate spending a dime at this place, because it was truly awful when we were there a couple of weeks ago.

We were practically the only people there, and yet we couldn't get service to save our lives!

The wine list is...uninspiring, to say the least -- and this is a \"wine bistro\"!

And the food couldn't be more forgettable. Hubby went with what he thought was a \"safe\" choice with the burger, but it was flavorless and the fries seemed like holdovers from lunch!  I had scallops with risotto and barely made a dent in it...calling this risotto is a stretch -- more like gummy mush -- and the scallops were like nibbling on a soft-serve salt lick. 

Yuck."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Solid offerings but nothing that blew me (or three fellow diners) away.

Fairly limited lunch menu relative to many other restaurants.

Not a place to avoid, but not worth a long drive."}
{"text":"This place is not closed...merely moved to a new location on Scottsdale Road! 

We had our first visit to this place last week and we were so excited to have a new \"wine place\" to go. We used to live 4 doors down from a fabulous wine shop and we missed having our \"place\". Our visit was during Happy Hour, which provides a $3 discount on glasses of wine. Originally we weren't going to stay for dinner, but the charming patio was so comfortable and the staff so friendly, we decided to stay. The pork roast with apples was outstanding. The portion size was perfect as was the pork roast. It was tender and flavorful! My hubby had the linguine bolognese and he raved at how good it was.

We will be back here again and again! While it's not a \"walk\" like we used to have, we are thankful it is easily within Uber-distance! So great!

My only suggestion....to put some greenery around the patio in lieu of having to stare at the large concrete wall just to the north."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! From start to finish!!! Full of flavor.......fulfilled every expectation!!! I tried the Roasted Salmon with dill caper cream sauce and basmati rice, Delicious!!! I have never ordered anything like that and it was fantastic! I'm so glad we tried somewhere new and I tried something new! Half way thru my hubby and I traded dinners, I got to try his Linguini Bolognese, which was a rich meaty delicious bowl of goodness! They even had a few items to choose from for our 6 year old, he had the chicken fingers and fries; looked homemade and fresh!! Really Excellent! We will be back, for sure!!! This is a great addition & compliment to my favorite next door pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Okay, I only write maybe 1 or 2 reviews a year. And only really when I have something good to say.  After such a great experience, I was compelled to post a review.   Simply put: the food was fantastic, great service and they had an impressive wine list.  We had 7 in our party, and everyone was raving about their choices. I really liked the preparation on the filet, and my wife's halibut was perfectly done.  We capped off the evening with a little coconut cake and chocolate mousse cake.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. Terrible service and such a bland feel to the place. Almost too cool for school and just a very unfriendly vibe.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I can't say thank you enough to Jude and Kellie for their assistance in helping me set up the most wonderful surprise party for my mother's 60th birthday.  I had one of every appetizer along with a lovely champagne toast for all my guests.  April was an amazing server who went out of her way to make sure everything ran smoothly.  The inside of the restaurant is chic and classy and was the perfect location for a get together.  Everyone of her guests enjoyed the food and atmosphere so much they said they would make the drive from Phoenix anytime to come back."}
{"text":"This is really a great place for lunch, Sunday brunch, or Happy Hour. This place rocks for excellent food & wine."}
{"text":"We went to the Grape Wine Bistro for a late lunch.  The location is not the best for the establishment as it is in the very back of the strip mall area.  If I did not 'Yelp' for places to eat in the area, I never would have come across this gem!

A nice gastro pub.  Very good wine and cocktail menu if that is your fair.  We came for the food as the word of mouth was strong on this.  We sat outside in the shade with a great breeze in the air.  Very nice and calming.

We started off with some Mollydooker Wine.  It is not the cheapest, but my wife loved it.  This was followed up with a house salad.  Freshly made and made to order per our requests.  Very good.

David our server was charming and very friendly.  Terrific server!  We ordered the Sausage Penne and the Bistro Burger.  The Sausage Penne was terrific.  Great flavor in the sauce, great bell peppers, penne, Sausage in a large portion.  The Bistro Burger with Truffle Fries was to die for!!!!  Soooooo good!!!  The fresh baked pretzel bun was terrific; the 100% Angus beef with the appropriate condiments were spot on!!  :)

One of the freshest tasting burgers my wife and I have tried.  We would highly recommend it.  You could almost share it with a house salad as a starter.

We ended the great lunch with that Chocolate Toffee Cake.  I do not do sweets any longer, however I caved and my wife and I shared this delectable divine desert!  

Plated perfectly and equally as satisfying!

I feel bad for the proprietors as the location is terrible.  They have no visibility.  People need to check this place out!  Great service, fair price, Great food!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I just had a very nice lunch here today.

I was looking for place to eat steak and open for lunch on yelp and this one came up. (not my choice, out of town guest's request).  This one and a few others came up on my search.  

It was such a lovely place, I really loved the decor. Since it was a business lunch and I needed to come back to my office, i didn't get chance to check out their wine menu but since the food was so good, I would like to come back here during dinner.

Steak we were looking for wasn't on the lunch menu but they kindly accommodated and served dinner steak during lunch hour.  Very nice cut filet with side of asparagus and potato. I like the sauce they used for steak, and really enjoyed the way they flavored asparagus.

Service was excellent.  She was so particular about the way she put food and silverware on the table, I enjoyed watching her serve food. It was very proper and shows she cares about what she is doing.

Very nice clean North Scottsdale Bistro, I can't wait to come back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"The cheese plate had a good assortment of St Andre,Rosemary Asiago and fruit
We enjoyed the steak au pouvre 
Nice atmosphere and very good service"}
{"text":"I tried Grape Wine Bistro today for happy hour and was very impressed. We were greeted promptly by a friendly waiter and took a seat at the bar. He immediately took our drink order and I was enjoying a glass of wine within 2 minutes! The wine selection was unique and they also offer a full bar.  Since we were meeting a friend for dinner we just ordered the cheese plate as a snack. They had 10+ cheeses to choose from along with 4 Italian meats. The plate came with marcona almonds, grapes, apple slices, crackers, baguette toasts and tasty apricot preserves. We chose a rosemary asiago which was amazing along with manchengo and sopressata which is always a good idea. I will definitely go back for dinner and recommend it to friends! P.S. They have brunch on Saturdays and Sundays with $1 mimosas and bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were wonderful!  Especially the company from the bartender...Matthew.  Come see them!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding service!  We got the sautéed calamari for an appetizer, shared a Cobb salad and the sole. My new favorite place in the area!"}
{"text":"PLEASE NOTE; THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT CLOSED, IT HAS RELOCATED TO  23335 N SCOTTSDALE ROAD, IN THE SPROUTS PLAZA.

After stopping by Sprouts for groceries, my husband and I were starving and actually stumbled upon this place. We had wanted to go to Blu Burger, but since they've since closed their patio to dogs, we stopped eating there.

Anyway, we were curious, and found a very nicely appointed wine bar with a really neat menu inside. The wine selection is absolutely excellent. I had a Daou Cabernet which was better than I even expected. My husband had the house Chardonnay, and for a moderately priced white wine, it too was excellent. 

Both off us had a hankering for burgers; husband had the classic burger with truffle fries, and I had the Blue Cheeseburger, which far, far exceeded my expectations; in fact, the burger was better than the one I had at Blu Burger. 

Because it was happy hour, drinks were reduced, and we got out of there with a reasonable bill. 

The best part? There is a dog friendly patio, so next time we go there, we'll be bringing Dexter and Molly without hesitation.  

This is our newest favorite place."}
{"text":"This place is beyond awful!! The menu is so over priced and the food was terrible!! No flavor on anything! The wait staff is just as bad. Unless you have an oxygen tank steer clear of this one!!"}
{"text":"I popped in for lunch and was greeting by the most knowledgeable and friendly girl ever. My order was served fast and cooked to perfection. Desert is a must have.  Great drink selection especially wines, however I will have to come back to indulge as I dint have a DD."}
