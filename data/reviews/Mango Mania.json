{"text":"The place is more for takeout.  Not many tables for socialization.  I order bao trio, mango mania, and Hong Kong classic.  The bao was ok, nothing special. Portion is quite small for $4.  Hong Kong classic was disappointing, it didn't taste like it had mango flavour at all.  Mango mania tasted more like canned mango pur√©e.  For $8 each, I expected to at least have fresh mango and not frozen ones."}
{"text":"Gave it a try and ordered Hot Mango Milk Tea + 3 Bao my first time. Bao were average, nothing outstanding but for the price I had higher expectations. The \"hot\" drink was luke warm, borderline room temp and I was disappointed. Second time I ordered another hot drink which again was not even warm... I was pretty bummed as my friends always love coming here for the cold drinks. Expectations were pretty high due to the all the hype on social media but for the prices posted I don't think I will be back anytime soon. Seating is kind of an awkward arrangement, my friend describes it as a bus station or bus stop seating which is accurate."}
{"text":"Came here late night and didn't feel welcomed at all as there was a group of people just staring us down maybe thought they were superior than us because they were friends with the workers oh well.."}
{"text":"Got the hong kong classic with a pork bao. The decor is nice for a bubble tea joint and reminiscent of a hipster coffee shop. Will probably not come back as the drink was underwhelming. There was too much ice in the drink that it masked the mango flavors. Also they just plopped in big chunks of pomelo which was dry and hard to drink with a straw. The tapioca also wasn't mixed well so the first couple of sips I was just drinking straight  tapioca. Ended up consuming the drink with a spoon. Similar to other reviews the bao is small and $4 is overpriced."}
{"text":"Mango juice is in grocery store tasted way better than the mango that they are serving. This place is over priced."}
{"text":"I love mango. It's probably one of my fave fruit flavors, whether it be real or artificial. 

I was actually really wanting to try some of their baos, but having just eaten dim sum and had no room except for dessert, my sister and I shared a mango milk tea (cold and served with pudding).

What I really wanted to try was the M&M&M (mango juice over milk slush & pudding, topped with vanilla ice cream and mango drizzle) but decided that I didn't want to have diabetes yet lol

Our milk tea was really good, not too sweet and the pudding was like a mango custard!

I can't wait to go back, braised pork belly bao & roast duck bao are on my must try list!"}
{"text":"Awesome place if you love bbt! make sure you try the Mango Mania, you have to love mango. Their boba and mochi are pretty good. Does get messy, you will need a spoon. For some drinks you can ask for half sweet. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this place. Baos seem to be the trend these days with everyone jumping on the wagon to put them on their menu. Mango mania's version though is top notch. The different toppings and flavor combinations on the pork belly and roasted duck baos were excellent. The pork belly and duck were flavorful and cooked really well. Melt in your mouth tender with the soft bao. The drinks are on the pricey side but the portion is huge and they use fresh mangoes. The coconut mango one was quite refreshing. The mango panna cotta was nice and not too sweet. The only downfall are the seating options. The tables and benches are the same height so not very comfortable for you to stay a while and chat."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant quality! The food, drink and staff were great. Mango Mania is the place to go for mango and bubble tea lovers."}
{"text":"Bought d hong kong style drink. What a delightful drink. Not ur conventional drink. Its a mix of really fun mangos n mini tapiocas? While many of the drinks are around $8, i still highly recommend this place. Hope they open another branch in d NW area so we don't have to drive down to to get this every time."}
{"text":"Their baos are soft and pillowy.i love the pork belly!!however,the drinks are sooo pricey and its not worth the price! Also the servers did not make us feel welcome. One of the chinese lady that was working there rolled her eyes when i asked for a cup of water.a group of asians (i think the owners kids) were staring us down(mind you it was our first time to be in a bubble tea place). Overall if you want to buy bubble tea,ill just go to teafunny or bubble mania. 0.5/5"}
{"text":"Being of filipino origin, mangoes have always been integral to our culture and history. I tried the baozi with roasted duck which left me happy with its serving size + price. I tried the HK Classic and I was very satisfied with it (minus the pomelo). I wish they would try another form of seating area. Not exactly great if group of people do not want to sit with other people. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is yummy. A bit on the pricier side. Guest service quality is underwhelming at times. The drink called \"Mango Mania\" is very mango-y! The baos are flavourful, unique, and delicious. The consistency of the pearls are great and have just the round amount of bounce."}
{"text":"This is one place I will come back to when I'm in Calgary again. Everything mango and everything fresh. The Mango Mania drink or more like a meal is so flavourful and for $8.00 it's a bargain. I enjoyed some of the snacks and the space is small but cozy. The vibe is really nice, the service is excellent. If you need to get a dessert or snack, definitely visit this place.

Here's my Vlog on Mango Mania. It's at 2:12

https://youtu.be/c7BIYunlnHQ"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert after dinner, i ordered the mango mania signature drink and my partner ordered the M&M, we also ordered the mango panna cotta, Mango pudding and mango sticky rice. The drinks were ok, the signature drink was to full of everything but the juice and the mango sticky rice was just awful, no flavor and bland and the rice was drier then normal, i have had this type of dessert at every Thai restaurant in Calgary and they know how to make this dessert. The price range is quite expensive for bubble drinks. So, it will put a dent in your wallet."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bubble tea places. Our favourite one is the coconut mango and my new favorite is the matcha milkshake special. Lots of different options if you don't like mango, but who doesn't like mango???"}
{"text":"Since it was mid-afternoon and getting to be 30+deg C outside, we decided to stop by Mango Mania for a quick and refreshing drink before carrying on with activities for the rest of the day!  I was curious to try this as I was a fan of Bubblemania for a period of time.

Atmosphere:  4/5  This shop is conveniently located on centre st and close to downtown so it was quick to stop by.  There are just a few tables inside as most guests tend to take out, but there is also some outdoor seating.  Clean and spacious; nice wooden type decor.

Food / drink: 4/5  At first I was curious as to how a shop could be just about mango, but I guess you can make a lot with it!  Lots of options on the menu including summer specials as well as food items (baos).  I decided on a passionfruit, thai basil, mango pulp and soda water combo.  It was really nice and refreshing on this hot day!  I did drink it too quickly though and the mango was kind of hard to get at the bottom.  The thai basil was a nice touch!  I would've preferred something a little less sweet though so maybe would get 1/2 sweet next time.    

Staff: 3/5  Overall efficient and friendly

Price: 3/5 $5 for my drink which was a little $ but to be expected for a specialty drink

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall I would recommend this place for a nice cool treat on a hot summer day!  The drinks are a bit sweet for me but it can definitely be ordered as half sweet.  I have also heard good things about the baos and would love to try one day =)"}
{"text":"I am crazy about mangoes!! You're really getting some quality delicious mangoness here! Friendly staff, clean and welcoming environment. I came here during my visit to the YYC and was I so impressed I arrived on a Sunday afternoon with my cousins for a sweet treat before an early dinner. We ordered 2 of the Mango Coconut, 2 of the Young Coconut, and a Hot Mango Tea special. The order came out pretty quickly! The presentation was lovely, the portions are huge, and the mangoes were fresh. Our group had no complaints. I love the varying textures from smooth and creamy with the coconut milk, to the perfectly made sago, and the large mango chunks. I would highly recommend anyone craving something sweet to come check out this awesome establishment. I can't wait to go back to check out their snack selection."}
{"text":"A surprise change compared to all the BBT shops around town (and by far much much better than places like Quickly).

I've had the M&M..&M as well as the Mango Mania drink - both loaded with mango juices and toppings.  The M&M..&M also has a scoop of vanilla ice cream in it as well.

Both drinks were refreshing and full of sweet mango flavour.  Every sip was delicious and the entire drink on its own was very filling too.

Which leads me to their steamed baos (buns).  I shared the Braised Pork Belly and Spicy Korean Chicken baos with my wife and they were hot and pillowy soft when they came out.  Both baos were delicious and I wish I had ordered more.  They're $4 each, a bit pricey for such a small portion imo but a nice treat every now and then.

Space is small and mainly caters to take out, but there is limited bench seating and side tables for you to enjoy your drink/baos there if you needed to.

Definitely check out this place if you're looking for a refreshing alternative to your standard BBT shop."}
{"text":"I think it's a very cute and simple place to hang out, easy to find and they have unique drinks."}
{"text":"I love mangoes! So when we drove by this place I had to stop. This place has a cute and clean little store front.  Many options for mango drinks and desserts. They also have \"boa. I only tried their mango Panna cotta and Hong Kong Mango drink. I enjoyed the Panna cotta because it was well flavored and smooth but not th mango puree on top. The drink was delicious. The size was generous too! I liked how much of their plastic was compostable. I would go back."}
{"text":"If you don't like mangoes, you definitely should not come here!! I've never seen so many items in a menu containing the word mango anywhere else!! ^_^
I ordered a fresh mango milk tea.  It was 5 Canadian dollars and it only came in one size.  They claim that they use fresh ingredients and not powder.  I took one sip of my drink and absolutely LOVED it.  It contains mango pudding and it was delicious!!! 
The only regret I have is that I didn't have time to get a second drink the next day, but I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mango Mania has a large selection of bubble teas with a variety of fruits and snacks. I am a huge fan of fresh fruit bubble teas and this place never disappoints. Coconut Mango is my go-to, but when the craving for mango is super strong, you can't go wrong with the Mango Mania. Their house-made mango mochi balls are also delightful - they are a little chewy with a subtle mango flavour. Other refreshing fresh fruit combinations are peach & mango and strawberry & mango."}
{"text":"Ordered the mango coconut smoothie, very tasty and refreshing! Would recommend this drink on a hot day. 

They do a $8 lunch special which is a rice bowl with a bubble tea - great value! The rice bowls have been very tasty, pork belly is my favourite."}
{"text":"Found this place by just strolling around.

I wanted an after-dinner beverage, to cleanse my palate.  I came across this place and noticed a few patrons inside. 

Their menu had a lot of dairy products in it, so I was limited to a small section of their options.  I didn't mind, but I can see how this could be off-putting to some one who can not have dairy.

I had ordered their mango mojito.  There was no one in line before I, and all other patrons sitting on benches in the dining area already had their items, so I had assumed it would be a short wait.  My drink took 10 minutes to be ready, longer than should be.  There was a glass canister with mango infused water, nice touch.

Drink was good, but not enough to tempt me for another.  If I do come back to this area, I may try their creative baos."}
{"text":"A little expensive but overall quite good. Their milk green tea is with real 2% milk. It tastes really different from other stores. Their coconut ice shake is also amazing! If you enjoy mangoes, this is 100% the place for you! I somewhat dislike their hot mango drink since it tastes awkward. They also open at 11:00 AM! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Mango Mania is Calgary's answer to all the mango lovers who have an insatiable thirst for the fruit! 

The space is clean and bright but small. It's take out only with only a couple tables to sit at. There are plenty of seats in the waiting area. 

Most drinks are $6 and the most popular drink, the mango mania, was $8. I didn't order it but I snuck a picture of someone's order like a creep (the things I do for Yelp.) It had mango balls on top, mango pearls and mango everything. I got the BC peach mango smoothie ($6) with mini pearl add-on ($0.50). The roast duck bao was soft, warm and delicious but totally over priced at $4. I'm fairly certain staff heard my astonishment when I shouted \"THIS IS FOUR DOLLARS???!\" 

Overall, this is a great addition to Calgary's bubble tea scene. I always said we needed more mango love in this town and us mango lovers finally got our wish."}
{"text":"Honestly the best drinks I have ever had in Calgary. The customer service is quick and super friendly. I'm obessed with mango mania and mango coconut! Thanks to kio for impeccable service far beyond description; she genuinely cared !  (sorry if I misspelled your name)"}
{"text":"Are you a mango maniac? I am. Do you want a drink that has fresh mango juice served with mango jelly, mango jello, mango juicy pearls & house-made mango mochi, topped with mango chunks? I do. I would come back if I were to be in Calgary again. Wish NY had a drink place like this! All we have is Mango Mango and it's not as inventive and creative as this place. Come on, how many different mango-things can you fit into one drink? A LOT."}
{"text":"Mango lovers rejoice!!
My hubster told me only that we had lunch plans today. As we drove across the city I guessed at the neighborhoods we might be headed to all guesses wrong. 17th, Mission, Inglewood, all wrong, and then we veer off to the north end of the city and onto 16th Ave. At this point I'm thinking BBQ, drive-in, my fave Cantonese joint... still wrong. We park and walk past a place that grabs my attention... wait, he was faking me out! We're stopping here!

As we enter Mango Mania, I'm noticing a super inviting space with a chill vibe. It was only his second time, so we were both really curious. As we surveyed the menu, I chose the Mango Mania blended drink and he had the Coconut Mango. My hubs wanted me to try some Boa; 2 of the Braised Pork Belly, Bulgogi Cheese Steak and Roast Duck.  We tried a side of the Kimchi Tots and received a Panacotta free with the first 3 Boa (AKA steam buns; deliciousness shaped like a soft taco. Steam Buns are NOT at all to be confused with those red bean or BBQ pork filled buns)

We planted ourselves on the wooden benches and dove in starting with the Panacotta (whats the point of being adults if you can't eat desert first?)

Next came the Kimchi Tots which were crispy tater tots with kimchi, garlic mayo, spicy drizzle, crispy bits and scallions. Each bite was better than the last, a small was the perfect size with 2 Boa each but I could muck a large no prob.


Lastly came our Boa, which we could not get enough of! I can't wait to try their other kinds, such as the Miso Mushroom and Spicy Lorean Chicken, but I will definitely be ordering the Duck every time!!  I wonder what they would do if I try everything on the menu, but I can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Mango Mania, (half?) sister bubble tea restaurant to Bubblemania Cafe, is all about the mangoes. Mangoes on mangoes on mangoes. It's mango paradise. Mango madness. Should I go on?

The inside is bright, clean and roomy although there's only two main areas to sit at. Counter is cute minimalist style and has all their fresh mangoes out on display.

Loyalty cards to get you coming back for more. Buy 9, get the 10th free! Menu is straightforward but they do offer some food items (boas and mango related desserts).

Hours are great; open till 1:00am on Friday and Saturday. Perfect spot to grab some late night bubble tea.

- M&M...&M ($7.00)
- Mango milkshake ($6.00)
- Mango mania ($8.00)
- Avocado mango ($6.00) - this one was my drink and obviously, had to get my favourite combo. Creamy, smooth but the whipped cream was a little too sweet for my taste. Next time, I'll just get it without.
- Mango lemonade ($3.00) - this was only $3.00 for a limited time. Oks got one to go but I ended up drinking half of it! I'm normally not a huge lemonande drinker but this one was great. Even got it again for my second visit; asked for half sweet this time which was perfect.

I like MM! If they keep on having specials on drinks, I'll keep coming back for more. Don't forget to grab a loyalty card."}
{"text":"After landing in Calgary, I decided to grab a snack and take a walk through downtown. I decided to stop by here because who doesn't like having some snacks and a boba tea??

The hostess was super sweet and she insisted that I try their signature mango maniac drink. And boy oh boy was it delish!!!! It's a real mango smoothie with added tiny mango but size, mango jelly and mango bubbles. This drink kept me energized through my stroll downtown.

Also, a must try item alert!! They have these amazing poutin Korean fusion. It's mixed with some interesting but very well chosen spices and a side mysterious but yummy veggies. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start my review with that I'm not a huge mango fan.  I tried the Hong Kong Classic drink which is fresh mango juice with milk, white tapioca, mango chucks and fresh pomelo pulp. The drink was actually pretty decent and it was not too sweet.  For $8 it was very filling. I also tried the pork bao which was just okay; it reminded me of vietnamese braised pork in a bun and I didn't care for the pickled cabbage that was sprinkled on the bao.  I enjoy the bao at watercress more.  Next time, I will try a drink which has less mango.  If you are a mango fan; this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If you like mango you need to check this place out. Their selection of mango drinks is bigger than you could ever dream! I tried mango with coconut milk, simple but delicious. I also tried their kimchi tots, and even though I'm not a huge fan of spice, I thought they were very good. Finally, I had a couple of their bun pockets with various meets, and they were pretty good as well. I was not the biggest fan of corn with the duck, but otherwise the pairings worked."}
{"text":"A mango lover's dream. Mango Mania reminds me of a mango dessert chain in Hong Kong I visited several years ago. I tried the Mango Mania which was was pretty good with plenty of toppings such as mochi, pearls, pudding, coconut jelly etc.  Although I wish the mangoes used were more ripe so the mango flavour/sweetness could come through. The avocado mango sounded like a weird combination to me initially but turned out delicious. The only topping that came with it was whipped cream and mango drizzle. So be sure to top it up with some pearls or whatever else you like!"}
{"text":"Saturday night craving for grass jelly and pearls with coconut milk and mango has been satisfied!  Love this place....

Love this funky place with the fun music and amazing drink selections either hot and cold.

Our son had a mango mania and I had a coconut flush topped with mango. The mango mania was amazing and very large! It was my son's lunch. My coconut slush had slivers of young coconut and a true delicious flavour that only real coconut could impart. I was lovin every sip 

We also ordered a few bao. Oh, wowza...the bao is hot, superlight in texture and not dense like a steamed dimsum bun.  I had a roasted duck and hubby had 2 bulgogi beef cheesesteak. We both enjoyed it. The best part was a free dessert when you order 3 bao's- hubby decided on a mango panna cotta. It was light, creamy with a solid vanilla undertone. 

There's not much seating but the service is warm and friendly. Please give this place a try! I think it will be particularly busy in the warmer months!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with some delicious mango drinks.   Tried mango mania, hong kong style mango, young coconut and the panna cotta mango dessert.  Not overly sweet and mango doesn't taste artificial.  The drinks are a generous size and quite filling.  Wish there were more places like this around the city"}
{"text":"The place is small but very clean and the staff is friendly. The 2nd time we went one of the staff asked if we have a loyalty card & we said no cuz we weren't given one before. That was the only sad part. The shakes is amazing purely fresh and u can taste the mango and other flavours. We tried the M&M (best one for me) young coconut, mango mania and mango milkshake. It was all worth it & would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Absolutely perfect for mango lovers! The mango pudding was rich and creamy. I also got the Mango Mania drink which was filled with everything mango."}
{"text":"Waited for a while to check this place out. Thought it was good, not great. Had the mango mania smoothie, veggie bao, chicken bao, and pork belly bao. A little over priced for what you get and thought the pictures look better than the taste."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick bite, the baos are really good but a little bit messy. Mango flavoured everything is a unique concept, the mango milk tea was really good. The wait time for the food was relatively short, even at busier hours. However there is limited seating indoors and out."}
{"text":"This place is magic! Their baos (pillowy, soft, steamed bread) are so good. I had the beef and the Korean chicken and both were heaven good. Also had the mango coconut drink which was fantastic. I liked that the drink comes in a large size (bigger than I normally would have chosen but glad I had it. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of mangos so I was a bit apprehensive when I walked in with my friend to see that mangoes were included in everything on the menu. I chose, what I thought, would have the least amount of mango taste, the Honey Lemon Mango and my friend got the Fresh Mango Milk Green Tea. There was the mango taste but it really wasn't that strong. I don't think I'll be going back if you like mangoes I'd recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Mango Mania, however I was quite disappointed with the quality of the food for the price. I spent $20 on 3 small baos and a mango drink which was comprised of mango juice and pearls. The pork bao was mostly a congealed fatty piece of what looked like jello. I think Mango Mania could have a great potential however at this moment I am quite disappointed."}
