{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The fettucini alfredo is off the chain!! Get it with build your posta option ( Mush/broccoli & Chicken my favorite). I  can assure you that they gotta little Maui in the pasta!! The staff was great its Chef driven."}
{"text":"New place. Needs to work out the kinks. $7.95 for 2 medium sized meatballs served luke-warm with garlic bread and a small salad. $2.75 for a 12oz can of Diet Coke.  Not a very good value."}
{"text":"Yummy lunch. They had three complimentary dips to try and all were great. I loved the artichoke. I ordered the lunch express baked ziti and it was delicious. It came with  a salad and homemade focaccia. So good!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried a couple of Italian restaurants in the area, looking for something to reach the standards of my Italian grandmother's cooking, and I've definitely found it here at Maui Pasta! These are some very classic Italian recipes and apparently the chef cooked in Italy for a few years! You can tell they use authentic ingredients too. At a really great price! I'm very pleased with my meal and service and will definitely come back here soon!!!"}
{"text":"They clearly have good intentions and are trying...nevertheless, after visiting Maui Pasta for our 4th dinner experience since opening early in April, we've decided to give up... The Bolognese sauce is pretty good, the Caprese salad is fine, the pastas are OK, a tad bit overdone for my taste; but I'm a bit disappointed in a restaurant that serves Italian pastas and doesn't have fresh ground pepper available for their diners, nor do they offer any ground cheese...and when we asked for some cheese they brought us essentially a teaspoon of grated parmesan...Duh!  And I have a major disagreement with ordering our meal at the front counter and being asked to make a decision on the gratuity before experiencing the food or service... That's just very inconsiderate to the patron....and frankly, it's dumb.  We wish them well, but will not go back."}
{"text":"Mother told me if you cant say something nice don't say anything at all. ................seriously folks, 7 employees trying to look busy, while I, the ONLY CUSTOMER, is waiting for a cold cut sandwich. 20 minutes,,,I looked back in the kitchen cause I thought they were waiting for Jimmy Johns to deliver it. But, there was a cook.  The sandwich was good but 20 minutes?  The manager, I assume he was the manager because he was the only adult, came up to me to ask how I enjoyed my lunch.  I told him if it takes much longer to prepare you can ask me how I enjoyed my dinner.   What I really don't understand is why they serve a sandwich for take out on a nice plate. I included a picture of my sandwich, on a dinner plate, sitting on the front seat of my car."}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous. You can build your dinner by picking your pasta, sauce, and top. I had the spinach fettuccine with bolognese sauce,and eggplant parmesan for the topper. It was delicious! My three companions enjoyed their food as well. Everything is made fresh onsite including three kinds of cheesecake. It's casual but nice- you order at the register, and they bring the food to you. They don't serve wine, but we brought a bottle of wine and paid a five dollar corking fee. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"So far I've only eaten here twice, but I can already tell you how much I love this place. Their pasta is so good- this is no generic Olive Garden type food. The cheesy garlic bread is absolutely amazing, I don't think I'll ever come here without ordering it. I've seen some reviews complaining about time spent waiting for food, but this isn't McDonald's so you need to have some patience. From my experience the wait wasn't even bad at all, it was appropriate for what I had ordered. I often find pasta bland and boring, but theirs is not like that at all. I'm excited to keep exploring the menu as I come here more. I could definitely use an order of that cheesy garlic bread right now!! Keep up the good work guys, you're doing great (especially for a newer place)."}
{"text":"We had high hopes, I had the stromboli lunch express, the meat was cold inside and the bread tasted like it had flour on it, another had the prosciutto panino and the meat was fatty and bread would not hold together, another had cheese ravioli appetizers was greasy, cold, and tasteless. Also the menu says 6 ravioli and we only received 4. The salad was nothing special. I am not sure how Maui has anything to do with the place. Finally the lunch express is promised in 10 minutes, we waited 20."}
{"text":"I work in the same complex and thought I'd give these guys a try.. Pizza was great so went back and had the cheese lasagna which was fabulous.  Make sure to sample their artichoke dip I think ate all of the samples and then bought some to go.."}
{"text":"A great little locally owned restaurant. They make all of their own pastas, sauces, and desserts. Food was delicious and a great value for the price, everyone in our group left full and most entrees were in the  $10 range. They also make a lot of their dishes as quick to go orders, just walk in grab them and go. Sadly we are from out of town or we would be here all the time. We wish we had something similar in our area."}
{"text":"The best take out or eat in authentic casual Italian food in Scottsdale. Everything is made with love of the finest ingredients, our favs are the paninis, chicken parmigiana, and tirimi sue. It is just what our local strip center needed to service residents and the corporate centers down the block. Don't forget to go in the mornings for coffee, cappuccino, and fresh baked goods!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I had been counting down the days for Maui Pasta to open since it is walking distance from my office, and I am happy to report that I've enjoyed my experiences so far! The food is super fresh (they make their pastas fresh in house), the place is quaint and clean, and the staff have been wonderful.  For food I've tried the meatball express lunch, turkey/avocado/provolone panini, and the prosciutto/mozzarella express lunch panini and all have been flavorful and tasty.  As an added bonus, they make their focaccia bread too, so the garlic bread and sandwich bread have this wonderful texture and flavor to them.  I'd definitely order all 3 of these items again!  The one thing to note is that they did just open about 2 weeks ago, so they are still working out some kinks in terms of getting orders out quickly or correctly, but if you point out a mistake they are quick to fix it, and have even offered incentives to come back so they can make it up to you, so that's a nice touch.  I foresee many more lunch trips to Maui Pasta for myself, and I'm glad to have them as a new food neighbor!"}
{"text":"Being of Mediterranean descent, I appreciate food that is flavorful and prepared with care and attention to detail.  Maui Pasta certainly is both.  I ate there April 13th while visiting the Valley.  I ordered the macadamia nut pesto on Cappellini and was very happy with my choice.  I recommend it for its crunchy texture and seasoning.  I like that you can choose your sauce and your pasta.  The bread was delicious.  It makes a difference when a place makes their own pasta, bread, and sauces.  The service was most friendly and courteous.  This makes or breaks a place in my opinion.  If you live in the southwest I find you really can't abide surly, inattentive wait staff.  I personally will not return to a place that has bad service for no apparent reason.  I also was pleased that our food was served hot and without a long wait.  Another plus for Maui Pasta is the atmosphere.  This restaurant is bright, sunny, and fresh and does make you think of landing on a Hawaiian Island.  At the same time, the restaurant has the feel of the family-run trattorias you find throughout Italy.  I look forward to trying other sauces and pasta dishes.  I took home the gouda mac & cheese.  It is a  lovely change from the usual mac & cheese.  I like the young people working amid middle age staff.  Coming from a retirement community, that is always nice to see.  I understand that the restaurant only recently opened.  That surprised me since it seemed to be running so smoothly while I was there.  I visit Scottsdale periodically and I plan to make a point of eating there each time I come. I gave Maui Pasta 5 stars since it offers quality food, with good service and at reasonable prices-- something you don't necessarily find in Scottsdale.  For the reviewer who was unsure of the Hawaiin connection, there is a framed article that tells their story and how they started their business in Maui."}
{"text":"I went on Grubhub tonight to find dinner, and Maui Pasta popped up. I had never heard of it before, so I came on Yelp to check it out. Honestly, between the menu and the classy, respectful responses from the owner to customers, and I had to try it. I had the penne vodka with the focaccia bread, and the pasta was soooo good! I may or may not have licked the bowl clean. The bread was also great. It was warm and soft, and it's a good thing there was only one piece because I would have kept eating it. For dessert, I had the lemon ricotta pound cake, and my son, who is the pickiest eater in the entire world, stole part and ate it, and then tried to steal my half. I feel guilty now trying this place without my husband, so I guess I'll have to take him there this week."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here through Grub Hub.  The make your own pasta is amazing. I also want to commend the owner Debi for excellent customer service. The meatballs ordered were not included in my order and informed grub hub and received my refund. Then unexpectedly received a call from Debi to apologize.   I definitely will be ordering again. Thank you again Maui. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Our family dined at Maui Pasta on March 25th, 2018.  We started with an Appetizer of fried/breaded ravioli which was delicious with creamy cheese inside and excellent sauce.  The Penne Pasta with house-made Macadamia Nut Pesto and Focaccia Bread was amazing.  It was the best Pesto since travelling in Europe and the Macadamia nuts provided a unique flavor.  The  portion was very generous.My wife had the House-made butternut squash ravioli and it was delicious.    All of the pasta, sauces, bread, and deserts that we tried are fresh made in-house (no store bought pasta!).    Most boutique restaurants serving high-end olive oil and house-made pasta varieties would cost $30-$40 per meal.  My pasta was only $12, the value was unbelievable.   Our entire Date meal cost less than $30!  My only recommendation is to treat the restaurants as boutique and have full servers in the evening rather than ordering in the front and delivering the meal to the table.    We will definitely go back again!..."}
{"text":"Breaded Ravioli. Make a point to get it. Everything we tried was amazing! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Have been here for takeout at least 6 times and have loved absolutely everything! We've tried the lasagna, the fettuccine alfredo, fried ravioli, cheese sticks, short rib angliotti - all have been excellent full of flavor and a great value!  Don't forget to get a piece of cheesecake too, it's excellent!!  They also have fresh pasta's and sauces to cook at home which are great too.  Their macadamia nut pesto sauce has become something we grab every time we're in and is now a staple condiment in our house - we put it on everything, bread, grilled veggies etc. very excited to have this addition to the neighborhood.  The family size lasagna was extremely handy when we had unexpected company and was great to not have to cook!"}
