{"text":"Just got back from a lunch at the Walnut Grill. I had been there once before about 3 years ago. I don't remember much other than it was a solid meal and the mushroom soup I got was good.

Anyway, it was fairly empty for lunch. Perhaps it's because it has a darker atmosphere (today was gorgeous out) than other SS places. I had the lunch special which was a Cajun chicken sandwich with mozzarella, basil and roasted red peppers (9$). GF got the veggie sandwich which has portabellos, spinach, feta and onions (9$).

My sandwich was great. The chicken was nicely cooked (not dry). The mozzarella was nice and big. The basil was a nice touch and fresh. The roasted red peppers were from a can, but were good. Served on warm ciabatta. Sandwich wasn't overly salty either. The fries were surprisingly good.

GF's veggie sandwich was equally good. I usually don't like spinach, but the bite I had was nice and feta/mushroom-y. She ate all of it (which rarely happens).

I also got a Proper draft which is an English Pale Ale. It was quite good. Nice and malty with minimal hops."}
{"text":"Good location, quiet restaurant for a quick lunch. The food was really good. Our server was very pleasant. We tries the chicken fingers and french fries for our toddler and had the chicken and brie quesadia and the chicken flat bread each was equally good. I will note that the chicken fingers were a good size not too much breading. Great experience"}
{"text":"I've had pretty good experiences dining here, but maybe that's because other people were paying for my food about half of those times.  The service was fine, and I liked the decor.  I also enjoyed the food, although if I recall correctly, there was entirely too much of it.

As a carless resident of Pittsburgh, I love the great location on Walnut Street.  I don't have to go out of my way to dine here, since there are plenty of stores to visit."}
{"text":"Tried this out for a lunch on Saturday. Wasn't too busy which was nice. I ordered the lettuce wrap appetizer and my friend ordered the walnut chicken salad sandwich. Both were very good!  Lettuce wraps were build your own which is nice. I would def recommend this to others and will come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This place used to be really fantastic and had a delicious cheese platter that was a great alternative to the typical greasy bar food.  They've since ditched the cheese platter and added on variations of pizza and cheese fries.  I miss Walnut GROVE, which had a touch more class to it."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but it was just as disappointing our second time around.  Service was very slow especially when we were only one of four tables.  The food is still bland and overcooked.  The oyster appetizer was gross."}
{"text":"My meal, including wine, appetizer, soup, and the walnut salmon entree were all solid and it came in under $40.  The average entree here costs $15.  In D.C., I couldn't get a sandwich, chips and a drink for that during lunch hour.  But by Pittsburgh standards for good food at low prices, this is pretty typical.    

The service was sharp, if a little slow (Saturday night and they were busy, so you have to cut them a little slack).  As a whole, they are really trying, with specials galore, and lots of fancy cocktails which I didn't  try.  

Seriously, this place is not expensive and you get a good quantity of food, they're not stuck up, and my generous $6 pour of wine was smooth but not awesome.  I will probably go back again."}
{"text":"I've been a solid customer for many years but since a bartender doesn't know know how to handle a busy crowd after a street party on a Saturday night, I will never go there again. She needs to learn how to respect her customers. Busy or not, DO NOT talk to me or treat me like trash. If you can't handle a busy night, find a new profession."}
{"text":"It is an alright grill but it is to fancy to be a grill and the pizza is way to greasy on the bottom and I hate all the seafood there"}
{"text":"Ok, this place must keep people coming by the ridiculous food portions that they have, because the food itself is not so great.  It's just...  ok.  Nothing special.  Some of it is not good or undercooked, such as a fellow diner's raw swordfish or mahi mahi that seemed more like tilapia.  Wine list just ok and very overpriced.  Dessert - WAY too big of portions (the brownie dessert was enough to feed at least 4-5 people and more, the brownie was undercooked).  There is better food on Walnut, I swear.  And even if there isn't, go somewhere else.  Service is good which brings this back to a 3-star review."}
{"text":"I had amazing service from our very attentive server, trevor. My drink was delicious and my food was hot. It came out quickly, and he was so polite and friendly that I will definitely return and request him! Very handsome too, if I might add. Last time I came in my server was a small blonde girl with glasses who seemed to be upset I came in, and the service could not have been better this time around!"}
{"text":"In a word, DON'T. The dying plants at the front entrance were an unheeded sign. The entire space is in a state of neglect. Leaf strewn patio, wicker chairs unraveling, a warning about a swarm of bees buzzing around and employees who made no effort to make their exchanges with one another discreet. Did I mention the strings of decorative lighting with all of the burned out bulbs? The food was better than the setting but so what?  The place needs some diligent management who knows how to keep things looking crisp."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite fish. Thursday is half off martinis.  Service can be a  little sluggish, tho they do have some really good servers."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to spot for any luncheon or dinner as the service and food used to be good. Unfortunately something has changed within the past month. I have been to the restaurant three times since August and today was my last straw. It took more than 50 minutes to receive our food and our waitress didn't bother to refill our drinks once. My friends and I will no longer be patrons of this establishment and will just have to find another spot."}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the Walnut Grill in Shadyside. Nor is it like its more casual downstairs neighbor, Shady Grove. You should know that in advance.  It is pretentious enough to have valet parking outside, but still Pittsburgh-trashy enough to have a sports bar with screaming fans as soon as you walk in. 

I have one gone to this location once, and the service was almost comically bad. I had one of the most inattentive waitresses ever. I think someone must have noticed, because a manager-type guy came by and asked if we needed anything.  I asked for a drink refill because my drink had been sitting empty for a good five minutes. It took him about that long to come back with a new diet soda.  After we finally got our food and had eaten, another manger-type came to clear the table, and spilled salad dressing all over the table.  He then attempted to clean it up with one cocktail napkin. Finally, when the waitress came with the check, her pen leaked all over the place. 

The whole experience was just ridiculous. I barely remember the food, because it was so over-shadowed by the weird service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is in fact good.but the portions are small and the prices are steep considering what you get. The staff is friendly and good but it seems they are trying to be a bit more than they are. Place is good for drinks with friends and seems to draw a good bunch of locals."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Mt Lebanon in 2012. We love having so many good restaurants and bars within easy walking distance of our home. Perhaps most puzzling is how Walnut Grill manages to stay in business. Within weeks of our arrival we watched and experienced the quality going straight downhill. But I cannot say we were surprised by it. We know this often happens when a successful restaurant with one location expands to multiple locations. They can quickly become diluted down to the lowest common denominator, which in the case of Walnut Grill means a 20-plus minute wait for low quality, bland, overcooked and / or poorly prepared, over-priced food, served by unhappy employees who are managed by an equally unhappy GM, or so it appears. And now we're hearing rumors that Walnut Grill plans to add locations in other parts of the United States. Presumably so that they too can experience the splendor of their heinous food and slow service.

We gave up hope a long time ago and would only visit for drinks, appetizers and the occasional burger, saving our more expensive outings for Bistro 19 and other joints. Eventually we stopped going to Walnut Grill altogether, saving our \"bar food\" outings for the always improving Saloon of Mt Lebanon (who by the way just ripped out their entire kitchen for a full upgrade, with upgrades coming to the menu as well). 

But last night, against our better judgment, we returned to an understaffed Walnut Grill for what will be the final meal we will ever eat there. As usual, it took about 20 minutes to get our food. My wife had the Greek Pasta, which was flavorless and dry. I had a cheeseburger cooked medium, which looked as if it had been placed in the middle of Washington Road and set on fire after being run over by numerous vehicles. I managed to detect a slight \"beef\" flavor underneath the layer of charred, burned-beyond-recognition crust of God-knows-what. If a restaurant can't make an $11 cheeseburger correctly, how can I trust them to make a House Cut Filet Mignon correctly? They should rename it the \"Never Again Burger.\" 

We may go back for drinks at the bar but that is it, and only because of the excellent bartender, Kevin, easily one of the best in Mt. Lebanon, and certainly one of the best we've encountered anywhere."}
{"text":"Ambiance is refined, with the dining area comfortably separated from the bar with big-screen TVs. There's also nice outdoor seating on the patio. Service was quick and attentive.

The bread was warm and delicious with a choice of 3 spreads. I didn't care for the chocolate chip butter, but the whipped butter and hummus were good. The calamari appetizer was half fried calamari (a little chewy but tasty) and half fried hot peppers. Of all the many places where I've ordered fried calamari, this was the skimpiest amount of calamari I've gotten. It should have been, at most, 4 hot peppers and the rest calamari. My daughter is vegetarian and she had very limited options. Not even a pasta dish without meat or seafood! I'm sure we could have ordered an entree and had them hold the meat, but we'd be paying the same amount, while the restaurant saves money on the meat or seafood. She ended up with a salad, which she enjoyed. One of our friends had the same salad and she said it was okay. The rest of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals: seafood pesto pasta, fish tacos, lobster mac & cheese, and vegetable flatbread. All in all, the food was very good and we had a nice, pleasant meal. But we probably won't be back until they put more vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give it one star but as you know, Yelp makes you give some sort of rating. 
My fiancé and I just walked out after sitting for 15 minutes at the bar and got no service.
There was one bartender on staff and she could barely keep up to her duties. She kept disappearing and the bar was getting packed with more people and again, no one was getting waited on. 
Don't waste your time, I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service! We tried tonight to use a coupon we received in the mail, but after we were seated in the dining room,  no one ever showed up to offer beverages or acknowledge our presence in anyway.  Waiters would repeatedly walk right by our booth without even looking at us, let alone stopping (they were not busy and there were quite a few empty tables). Finally after 15 minutes of being totally ignored we gave up and walked out. I wish I could give negative stars, this place is really abysmal. I will never return and have tossed the coupons in the trash."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late lunch last Sunday. Very disappointed! We asked for a booth and then was told there were none available- meanwhile all the booths were open but one. Service was incredibly slow. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"When I visited walnut grill in shadyside, the service was very good, however the only problem I had was when I ordered a ribeye steak sandwich and the server informed me that this can only be cooked one way. The sandwich was good, I just don't understand how u can only cook a steak one way. Decent beer selection, but would probably not go back."}
{"text":"The apricot glazed salmon was delicious. The rest of the meal was not. The rice pilaf had little taste and was rather cold. The veggie mix was carrots, snow peas and cabbage so I passed and chose the baked potato. Unfortunately the potato was over baked and came with a very small portion of sour cream. The atmosphere was nice but the wine glasses were very foggy."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very good food, very pleasant and efficient service.  Enjoyed the fruit and cheese plate and the Greek salad."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch. Their selections were decent but there weren't as many options as other places in the area. For the price though, it was well worth it. Prime rib was great; they actually had medium rare. Omlet bar hit the spot as well. Service was good."}
{"text":"Ended up here because we were not waiting 45 minutes for a table at Burgatory.  Glad we decided to give it a try.  The food was pretty good and our waitress was great.  She even bought us dessert!  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very meh overall for this chain type restaurant. Nothing stands out with entrees, cocktails, or atmosphere. Over priced and forgettable. Easy to do better in the area."}
{"text":"The location is great, right in the South Side of Pittsburgh with an Apple store close by. The food is alright but a little bit pricey depending on what you buy there."}
{"text":"I have been coming to walnut grill for years and I am never disappointed! My husband even proposed to me at the Mt. Lebanon restaurant with a custom made dessert. I love tasting the different hummus and butter varieties with the fresh bread at the start of the meal. Some of my favorites on the menu are the sweet chili chicken boneless wings, the beet salad, the Parmesan crusted chicken, and the barbecue chicken flatbread! I recommend this restaurant to families and couples and friends dining out!"}
{"text":"I hosted my wife's 40th... I mean, 29th, birthday party here and the service and food was fantastic.  It was also a surprise party, on a Saturday evening, so the restaurant was packed.  The manager and staff did a phenomenal job hiding my party of ~50 people in the back room, and helping \"pull the wool\" over my wife's eyes upon arrival.  
We had a buffet of apps and smaller plates that were kept plentifully stocked by the attentive waiter/waitress.  And the drinks were delivered even more quickly.  
Went so smoothly...  it was as if we had the entire restaurant to ourselves."}
{"text":"In a typical week, we are usually here at least one time.  I am not sure why it's taken me this long to write a review!  They have great specials and their happy hour app prices are fantastic.    We typically eat the same things because they are our favorites.  I highly recommend their crab cake, pulled pork nachos and fruit and cheese plate.  My husband just discovered their wings and reports that they are great.  He is also partial to their cobb salad and fish sandwich.  They have a nice selection of spirits behind the bar and you can't beat martini night--great prices for excellent drinks!  But, mainly, we go there because we feel extremely comfortable there and it's very convenient to our home.  And, most importantly--we have never had a server who wasn't extremely pleasant and personable.  Jordan (server/now bartender) is really a great guy---he makes the experience even better.  All of these things combined bring us back time and time again."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner Sunday night. Service was friendly but extremely slow. Waited 40 minutes for our meals which were followed by the appetizer which came with the jalapeños we had asked to be omitted. 

I expected the appetizer would be comped since it didn't arrive until after our meals, but it wasn't. 

Our meals were good and the server was very friendly, but overall the experience was lacking."}
{"text":"I don't really get the complaints. The food is, yes, on the pricey side (you're looking at ~$18 per entree), but I've never had poor service or undercooked food myself.

This is a reasonable place to go for a nice steak and -- come on -- they have a well-priced sandwich list if you're feeling stingy. I would suggest the pork in cream sauce... absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I usually get the chicken flatbread. Ceaser salad ..or the salmon or steak. delish!"}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet Sunday night for my first time with some family.  Here's how the meals went...2 pasta dishes, both room temperature, 1 pear salad in which they forgot the pears, one fish and chips which was ok, and the best of all...a children's corn dog served STILL FROZEN!!!  Yep, the corn dog was still ice cold and frozen!  The server said something about problems in the kitchen (really?), but that doesn't help me.

We sent EVERYTHING back.  Second time around everything was better, but by then...

The server was good, and the manager gave us desserts for our aggravation, but I still don't think I'll be going back any time soon. It was a $90.00 meal that was not worth it all.  Rather than giving us desserts, the meals should have been comped, in hopes we would try again.  But I won't."}
{"text":"My only experience with this place was for brunch on a Sunday morning. However....

It was quite fantastic! I was sitting with three other people, and all of our food was delicious! (Not to mention reasonably priced)

Our server was delightful and very efficient as well.

I have read some negative reviews here and kept them in mind before eating there. Must say I didn't agree with them on this particular meal."}
{"text":"I had my rehearsal dinner here for my wedding and it was great! The patio area is awesome with firepits and sometimes live music. If you want to go on the patio in the winter part of it is enclosed w/ heaters which make it more of a private dining area. Happy hour tends to have some good drink specials. We really like the menu and drink selection. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is every once in a while we get a bad server or the food just isn't on point. Overall I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Decided to take my wife (and children) to Walnut Grill (WG) for Mother's Day dinner aanndd as usual, I was not let down. We have eaten at this WG on numerous occasions and have always had good service and a good meal. Now whilst there were one (or THREE) speed bumps, our overall experience was pleasurable. Being the gentleman that I am, let me start with my children. They ordered burgers off of the kiddos menu (that were priced at $5.95)and we'll they got what we paid for. While they were okay the patties were about the size of a flattened out golf ball. They were dwarfed by the size of the bun AND outside of that their meals were fine. My twin T-Rex's devoured them like nobody's business. Now this is were the fun begins. My wife ordered some $19.00 chicken dish (forgive me ladies for not remembering the name) with a baked sweet potato. Well when it arrived the chicken was okay, HOWEVER the baked sweet potato was very cold. So our server (Jason J.) who I want to add was a freakin phenom took it back and brought my wife one that was as hot as Chernobyl in August. Weelll by the time that came back to the table the chicken was so cold it needed a coat. Our waitstaff scooped it up (like the pirates in the World Series trying to hit the cut off man) took it in the back and had the kitchen do their magic. When it returned it appeared to be on life support waiting to have the plug pulled. When my (patient AND good spirited) wife tasted it, it left much to be desired. Again Jason rode in and without a single excuse took the moment from ZERO to HERO!! And did not stop until my wife was sated. And I appreciated that because she was the reason we were there. Did I say Jason J. was a phenom already? Now as for me (the also ran) my meal was great. I had the $18.00 wild mushroom chicken w/the baked sweet potato, a side of cream spinach and water and quite frankly I could not have been happier. By the way did I say that our waiter was a phenom? Everything was hot, moist, succulent, etcetera. I enjoyed it, AND the company of the wife that tolerates me, and the kidZ that love me. To some this up (before it turns into war & peace) we had a great time in a clean establishment with great waitstaff. Oh and lest I forget my kidZ loved the tv in the louvre over the urinals. I had to almost pry them out. In summation I vote with my money and my feet and WG rest assured they will BOTH be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Went to eat dinner with my family. I ordered a salad. As I mixed the greens, there was a long strand of hair in my salad--disgusting. However, the waiter took my salad away--and said \"sorry.\" We ate and finished our dinner. I asked to speak to a manager. I told the manager \"Scott\"  that it as very unusual for a manager to never come to the table and apologize. I thought it would be customary for a manager to approach the table and share that he/she spoke to the kitchen, and maybe say this \"is unusual\" and maybe offer a free appetizer. Nope, \"Scott\" replied I thought \"Brittany\" (the 12 year old waitress) handled it. I am very disappointed-even Wendy's would have handled this better. Customer service is everything-all consumers should be treated as such."}
{"text":"The worst!  Weird decor and atmosphere. Food, blech!"}
{"text":"Everything I personally had was so salty it was hard to eat really . But staff was pretty nice and the environment wasn't too terrible . But good sweet lord the salt..... If you have a heart condition please don't eat here ."}
{"text":"Way over priced!!!!  Had to take my med steak and beat on the bar to tenderize it. Did I mention it was over priced?"}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a rainy and dark Halloween evening. (No, this is not the start of a horror story!)  Given the choice of the patio (which was actually a room inside with large windows) or the dining room, we opted for the quieter dining room.  With 90% of the room empty, we were seated at the booth right next to the kitchen entrance. No big deal and of course we could have asked to be seated somewhere else had it mattered.

She got a vodka mojito which she loved as it was really minty and she's not much of a drinker. The Jamesons I ordered was a generous pour.  We decided on Artichoke and Spinach dip for an appetizer, which came with some tasty sesame seed crackers as well as tortilla chips. The dip was packed with artichokes and we liked it. And it was probably enough for 4 people.

The entrée was potato-crusted cod for her and a filet for me. Both came with veggies. I thought the filet was delicious although a little undercooked for medium. And she gave her cod a thumbs-up. The salad I got was fresh and sized just right. I tried crème brulee for dessert and the crust was a little overdone - had a burnt undertone to it. But still I ate it all. We both enjoyed the coffee after the meal, very robust.

Service was a little slow IMO given the small number of patrons at the time but cheerful and polite. But I should mention that sometimes I've been known to think the service is slow when it's just a restaurant's way of not trying to rush people.  Two drinks, two entrees, an appetizer and dessert with coffee came to just under $100 before tip. Would probably go here next time we're in the area as I'm done with the long waits at that burger joint in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited the Fox Chapel Walnut Grill last night and had Jeremy as a server. Jeremy was extremely polite and very attentive. We had a great experience.  We sat on the patio, there were lights romantically strung above us and beautiful landscaping around to create some privacy from the parking lot. The entire restaurant was clean and tidy.  We ordered Loaded Tater Tots as an appetizer and received them in a timely manner with the jalapenos on the side like I asked.  Our drinks were never less than half full.  My boyfriend ordered the House Cut Filet Mignon rare with asparagus and a sweet potato.  His filet was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing, as well as the sides.  Steaks never come out cooked correctly for him so he was thrilled!  I ordered the new Smoked Pork-Tip Mac N' Cheese it was delicious and the portion was very large. All together our time there was wonderful and we would recommend Walnut Grill to anyone! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Our first visit. I had the fish taco's and fries - they were very tasty.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, not because they were busy, but because the hostess was MIA- service was very average, bordering on subpar."}
{"text":"The only good thing we had here for 3 of us were the beverages.  Food was awful"}
{"text":"While visiting family on a recent trip to Pittsburgh, we decided to have dinner at your restaurant.  We found the food to be very average, but that is not the reason for the low star rating.

It was during happy hour and our waitress (Ariana) pointed out the drink specials and prices.  I was uncertain about ordering the sangria after hearing her description but was assured that if I didn't like it that I could order something else.  When she brought our drinks to the table I took a sip and decided that it really wasn't what I was looking for and asked if I could get a glass of house wine listed on the happy hour menu.  She said sure and came back with the wine.  At the end of the meal my husband picked up the tab so I did not have an opportunity to look over the bill.  After returning back to our hotel room I realized that not only were we charged for the sangria but we were charged full price (not the happy hour price) for my glass of wine.

One mistake, maybe, but two, I think not.  This was an attempt to pad the bill in order to receive a larger tip.  I'm guessing that the establishment did not tell her to do this.  If you decide to eat here, be sure to check your bill before paying.  My suggestion, find a place that is more honest with better food!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Very slow. Food was mediocre.  Crab cakes were awful. Worse than eat park quality.  I called the manager. He offered no help at all. Just said to try back again!  Sure....I will do that!  :("}
{"text":"Modern and upscale decor. The service at the bar was super friendly and excellent.  The fried pickles were good. The drinks, fast, tasty, reasonably priced.

We only spent about 45 minutes there, but I wouldn't hesitate for a second to go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  

My husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  

My husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.

 The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.

The pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \"al dente\" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.

Overall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree."}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of the Duck Tacos but the service was good and the Lobster Mac was VERY good. Add to that a nice Bloody Mary and the coupons they mailed out...we'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again for lunch. Got the worst peice of salmon for lunch today. Food is mediocre quality w/4 star price tag. Damn at least give me what u gouged my pockets for. Total rip off."}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best experiences I've had at a privately owned restaurant in a long time! As far as first time visits go, this was among the top. Everything from to the food, to my waitress Nell was phenomenal! I had a few questions about the menu it being my first visit after all, and she was able to give plenty of suggestions on what was popular, and which beverages paired well with certain meals! If you're looking for a reasonably priced meal, as well as a wide range of foods, matched by a friendly and knowledgeable staff this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The food is okay but nothing special and over priced. I've been going here sporadically for years and seem to have bad service no matter how much turnover there has been. It could be rude personalities one time then forgetting the bacon on an item to giving me chicken in a salad instead of steak the next. I don't see the staff write down any orders which I think could attribute to some of the food errors but in general the drinks aren't refilled and the smiles are missing. The atmosphere is the best part, inside and outside are both very nice. I'd recommend sitting outside and keeping your expectations low if you are going to eat here."}
{"text":"Oh man...this place is worse than an Applebee's and that, in my book, is saying something. The food was absolutely horrendous - I didn't realize a restaurant could mess up a side salad and a chicken wrap (seriously)! They managed to mess it up. Service took a long time but the waitress was super friendly (hence the two stars). I would never recommend this place to a friend though."}
{"text":"Great location, food, service, and drinks!  My only complaint was the hostess.  We got there about 7:45 on a Friday night and did not have reservations.  Never thought we would even need reservations (it was a snowy night) but of course we would not mind waiting for 15-20 minutes.  The hostess asked us if we had reservations when we said no she made us sit for 10 minutes in the lobby. No one else was waiting, the restaurant was not crowded and seats were open. She stood there and 10 minutes later brought us to our table. It was uncomfortable and unnecessary.  Our waitress made up for it though. They had a nice draft list and I went with the Tenacious Traveler Shandy (delicious and perfect for a warm sunny day which I was thinking about!). The bread they bring out is so fresh with a fantastic butter spread (some sort of chocolate raspberry that I could not stop eating). They have a great menu and I went with the turkey club which had bacon and a delicious cranberry sauce.  My date ordered a chicken gnocchi entrée which he raved about.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I called this establishment today to place a takeout order, and was put on hold for close to five minutes after being asked to wait for \"just a minute\".  The individual finally returned to the line to inform me that he wasn't able to take my order due to current food orders in progress, but could possibly call me back in around 20 minutes...to take my order.  I told him there was no point to such a process, and that if he wasn't currently able to take my order over the phone, then I would find another option for dinner.  I would have appreciated being told that there would be a long wait for my order, to which I would have politely declined, and found another option rather than have someone tell me that I needed to wait to be called back...just to place an order on a Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and didn't like the selection (it was mostly breakfast food which I didn't want) so I ordered off the regular menu and got the potstickers which were delicious. I also got the spinach and artichoke dip which was pretty standard. It was a little expensive for what you get, it wasn't amazing, just good. Our waitress was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I both said we would come back. And that is the true test of a restaurant, in my opinion. Snapper was great. Veggie of the day was delicious: (a mix of kale, cabbage, & carrots). Interesting salad dressing: ff tomato basil-yum. Service was prompt and very pleasant. Grilled chicken salad was generous & the Chkn & fries were tasty."}
{"text":"This is place is disgusting. Cold food. Horrible service. Chicken was half cooked. Must be the junkies they have working there. Overall horrible horrible place. People i was with found red hair in the food. Couple mins later walks out a red headed chef. Save your money and your guts. Any other place in or around aspinwall is ten times better"}
{"text":"They accidentally over charged us and Refused to give us our over charged money back.  They sent us a gift card one month later. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Bartender was extremely rude, slamming our silverware down on the table when we asked for some. Our table didn't have any place settings. The brunch buffet was empty. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour, but the vibe was actually pretty somber. The bartender was forgetful and seemed like she could care less about serving drinks. The first wine I ordered on the menu wasn't even in stock. It was an odd experience all around.

The one redeeming quality was the food - we had a hummus and veggie plate that was actually pretty good. Perhaps someone in the kitchen still has a clue? The rest of the evening we basically just drank our wine and tried to limit our interaction with the staff.

Dear Walnut - I used to love the Shadyside location, so please try to shoot for that level of quality when selecting your bartenders and building your menu."}
{"text":"There were 12 of us there last night for my birthday.  The food was good, the drinks yummy and the service fantastic.  Dom, our server was attentive and on point.  Walnut Grove also offers a fabulous Happy Hour, the prices are unrivaled in the Fox Chapel area!!"}
{"text":"while it takes a scant amount of quality service to impress me, it takes a mega butt ton of hard work, determination, zeal, and carelessness to significantly underwhelm me as did this place on new years eve at approximately 930pm-11pm.

friends and i went here for a pre-partying meal.  i went very low maintenance and ordered the Reuben.  one friend ordered steak, medium, and the other ordered something else that escapes me but there was no issue with it and was quite good from what was reported.  as an appetizer we also ordered fried pickles and lobster cheesecake.  wait, i know what you're thinking, lobster cheesecake?  it actually tastes worse that it sounds.  very, very bland.  incredibly airy and light.  probably because it was void of all taste.  the pickles were a mess.  no other way to describe it.

the main food took forever.  too long for a semi empty dining room.  we were the only table in the back section.  we found ourselves asking each other several times where the server was with our food and drink refills (liquor, not soda).

my friends steak came well done.  no pink.  again, she ordered it medium.  it was sent back and she requested no replacement as she didn't want to wait again.  my Reuben came with a fair amount of meat, always a good sign, but apparently this was the great thousand island dressing shortage of 2012.  both pieces of sauerkraut would agree with me.  so i got a toasted sandwich with some reuben on it. for $10.75 for a sandwich, i expect a masterpiece.

drinks and refills took the better part of the meal but that's alright because the server boasted about it when she described her bathroom break while i was trying to eat.  yep.  truth bruv.  but at least the other server who dropped by that was describing his acting (extra work) experience and unimpressively name dropping famous people he didn't meet did not leave me asking the age old question, \"oh, you're an actor?  which restaurant?\"

i've been to the walnut grill in wexford, and while i'm not a fan of the white trash, discount, dollar store mecca that is the north hills, it's been a good experience every time.  can't imagine what happened with this place.  one star because i can't go any lower.  one more for a decent amount of meat on the sandwich."}
{"text":"While I am the farthest thing from a fan of her sister-restaurant (Ip Modern Kitchen) Walnut Grill is great. 

This fun little place has a great menu, with some really great deals. Monday and Tuesdays feature cheap burgers, there are drink specials daily, and the staff is always friendly. We have begun to frequent Walnut Grill, and have yet to be disappointed. 

Oh! Make sure you ask for bread if they don't bring it out to begin with. It is made right there, comes out warm, and always has some interesting things to spread on. 

The buffalo chicken wrap is good too. 

My only complaint here is that the Guinness is served in a tulip shaped glass, but is a significantly lower volume than a real Guinness glass (12 ounces here, vs 16 with an American Pint Glass, or 20 with a European glass). 

We love this place, and recommend that people try it out!"}
{"text":"First off, the staff was very pleasant. The staff gets five stars. 

We got the sangria and buffet for Sunday brunch. Our sangria came with a fly, which the waitress immediately and apologetically took care of. However, I'm still unsure since the fly was originally in the pitcher, why the whole pitcher wasn't replaced, just the glass that the fly was poured into was. We were comp'ed another pitcher. Didn't actually taste like there was wine in it. 

Every single plate on the buffet table was dirty. We looked through the stack of about 30 plates and while the tops were clean, it looked like no one had even bothered to wipe off the backs. We noticed that the smaller plates on the fruit buffet were clean so used those instead. 

We got there right at 10, so the buffet food wasn't even all out when we arrived, yet when the sausage was brought out it was difficult to impale it with a fork. The hash browns were underdone. 

I guess we figured out why the place was so empty..."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a family dinner and was very excited to finally try this place after hearing good things about it. 

It's...ok. On a good day.

The highlights of the Walnut Grill are the fantastic drink menu and interesting menu items - seriously, the ingredients used in some of these dishes showcase that the menu creators were very creative people. 

At the same time, for me, the drawbacks include those interesting menu items and ingredient choices; this is another place I've been to recently that for whatever reason decided to dedicate itself to a few items and feature a short, two-sided menu, which is chock full with some...well, interesting food item choices.

And sure, this is also a good thing, especially for the adventurous eater; the problem with this is that with a two-sided menu that features non-standard menu items - as opposed to simple, classic menu items - you better be in the mood to spend money, eat a lot, and try something new if you're going here. 

This wasn't a major problem for me while I was there, as I happened to be in the right mood for a non-standard dinner item; I also happened to eat here while one of their featured items was crab-stuffed salmon, which I'm partial too. But even this item was just ok; I've had a much tastier version of this same item at another restaurant nearby. Here, I got a lot more salmon than I did crab in my dinner, and the seasoning used was so bland it may as well have not been used. So basically, I paid a lot of money for a fancy dish that didn't even taste like one of its ingredients was really there. My family had no problems with their dinner items, for what it's worth.

I'm sure I will return for a happy hour, as the drink menu really did look enticing, and I do love a good happy hour (who doesn't?). But still: this is also a restaurant, and I don't think it's too much to ask for a chain restaurant to have a menu that's longer than two pages (not to mention making the food taste good enough to be worth the money) - and I truly believe every restaurant should be required to have at least one simple, classic comfort food; sometimes, that's all a person wants."}
{"text":"I hosted a wedding shower here and it was a great experience. The staff was very helpful, the room looked beautiful, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this particular Walnut Grill.  Stopped in for dinner and was treated to slow service and cold inedible food.  Not typical from past experiences with Walnut grill but will be a long time before returning.  Manager was luke warm in response and was \"nice\" enough to not charge for food that was not edible or consumed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the location on Walnut street, but this new chain location was a terrible waste of time and money. 

In short- the water glasses were dirty, my seat was wet and full of crumbs and the table cloth had stains from the previous clients.  Not a great first impression! 

The service was terribly slow, the waitress never brought us bread (which I love with dinner), the bar was out of the wine I ordered and my dinner was the size of a kids meal.  By the way, I am 155 pounds and I don't eat meat, so if it looks like a kids meal to me - then it's truly a tiny portion!

Skip this place and go to a nearby restaurant that will serve you an adult dinner, and for less money."}
{"text":"I like Walnut Grille. The service is good and the food is equally good. 

This location is in the Waterworks complex competing with Chili's and Eat N Park. Honestly, that's no real competition because this place is a notch above that with some of their food creeping over into the very fine dining category. 

My only wish is that they offered more seafood options on the menu. Salads here are pretty solid and lunches are quick if you let them know you need to get in and out. 

Happy hour here with friends is a bunch of fun regardless of whether you want to drink or not. TVs are well placed in the bar area and you can opt to dine at tables around the bar, in the dining room or outside when the weather is nice.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"How to review the Walnut Grill?--a place that served us quality food on a standard menu, but at prices where some imagination would have gone a long way, especially since we paid a lot for it? (Mango salsa, I'm looking at you.) Some of our favorites: the spinach artichoke dip, the pork cheeks, the filet. 

This particular dining experience was also the first time ever a server has ever, with the gravest of grave faces, relayed to us that the kitchen was out of broccoli. Also the first time I giggled at a server. If you're out there: I'm sorry!"}
{"text":"This place has consistently good food and good service. I have been here multiple times with a variety of people and everyone has always left happy. They have a room in the front for large groups. My husband always orders the salmon and says it's very good. I jump around a bit with my menu selections, burger, sandwiches, salad, all yummy. A highlight for me was the brownie sundae dessert. Very good. Also has good options on the children's menu. We will be back."}
{"text":"My mom took me here for lunch one day after she had a great experience there with her sister and mother for some occasion or other. I feel kind of bad because my experience here was very nice, except.. it was the first time in my life I've ever sent food back because I couldn't eat it. 

Service was quick and efficient and we were seated right away. My mom ordered the crab cakes (which I almost ordered, and bet that if I had, this review would be 4 or 5 stars) and a side of fries. I got the fish tacos with a side of fries. Food came out pretty quickly, and my mom and I were both completely in love with our fries -- they had this almost crumbly, crisp coating on them that just made them heavenly, and the right amount of seasoning. My mom raved about her crab cake, but my fish tacos were inedible. :( 

I discovered fish tacos last year when we visited The Goat in Put-in-Bay and have been getting them every time I see them on the menu someplace ever since. I've loved them every time, but this time I got a mouthful of dried cabbage and nothing else for my first bite, and my second bite was filled with VERY fishy, off-tasting fish. I'm known to be kind of picky, so I thought it was just me and tried another bite. Still off. I had my mom taste it, and she was kind of appalled -- so that's when I knew it wasn't just me. 

I explained this to the waitress, and she said she'd talk to the kitchen. When she came back, she said she had taken the fish tacos off the bill and that the kitchen would be happy to make me something quick. Honestly, I was full on those fries, so I said no -- but she must have apologized a hundred times, and was very sweet about the whole thing. So.. being my first experience sending something back, I was nervous, and it couldn't have turned out better. 

I honestly think that I just got a mistake. And it happens. I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to go back and give them a second chance. Given the rest of my experience, though, I definitely would if the opportunity arose."}
{"text":"I swung by here in the middle of a long day of apartment hunting.  It wasn't very crowded.  There appears to be an adjoining bar area - not sure if it's the same restaurant or not - it's quite small, but contains several comfortable-looking booths and TVs.  Anyways, I was there for lunch.  The service was decent, we were tended to by several friendly employees and the manager came out to see how we were doing, complimenting my father on his choice of Malt Vinegar to accompany his fish and chips.

The food was good, but probably not worth as much as we paid.   For the life of me I can't remember if they had any good beer on tap, I think I drank like forty glasses of water instead.  But I'm sure they've got something acceptable.   I can see myself coming back but probably not as a mid-afternoon pit stop like I did.  It's probably more lively at night ."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really casual and a nice place for dinner or happy hour. Their entrees are decent sized for a meal and their sweet potato fries are really good."}
{"text":"We were here for celebration of my Grandma's life. We had a large group so things ran a bit slow but the 2 servers were very courteous and never slowed down. The salads were fantastic and I had the walnut salad. I ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was very crunchy from being overcooked and the banana peppers were scorched. The sandwich was very dry which I'm guessing was due to overcooking. My girlfriend has the turkey club and the crust was hard and the taste was mediocre. I'd have to say it's a very nice restaurant but on this particular occasion the chef failed. Therefore the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ended up with an awesome Martini special. Surprise! We all ordered salads. All were fresh and dressed properly. Not too much dressing. 
Our service was awesome! I love when a restaurant trains well and hires great staff. It definitely makes the experience worth it."}
{"text":"Half decent food but overpriced.. Have been here a couple of times but my favorite memory is when my friend who was in the middle of a 4 day blackout binge started to hit on a 50 year old woman and told her I want to fuck you!! That was enough to get us kicked out.. I guess they don't appreciate a good straight forward flirting lol mind you we were 25 lol"}
{"text":"Remember how the manager the second time said he'd give me a call back about \"whether there is anything he could do for me\" after the whole stir? (insert sarcastic exclamation here): I never heard back! Well, at least they are consistent..."}
{"text":"Had brunch there yesterday. It was great & reasonably priced. I was worried at first that the food was looking a little dried out, but I mentioned it to the waiter and the manager came out and had it replaced. Very friendly, helpful staff & manager.  Fantastic. Prime rib & ravioli & made to order omelets. Yum!"}
{"text":"I will review this establishment only once because I will never go back there.  My husband and I and another couple stopped to have something to eat after a movie.  Because the dining room was soon closing, we were seated in the bar area at a booth.  We waited at least 10 minutes for someone to come and speak to us at which time we told the server we needed two more place settings of flatware.  When our food came, the waitress placed it on the table and rushed off so fast, we didn't have time to remind her that we still needed two place settings.  We had to sit there letting the food get cold until we could flag down another waiter.  Never during our time there did she offer us drink refills.  Finally one of our party left the table and asked the manager if we could have more drinks.  Several times while we were eating both the waitress and the manager spent time at the table adjacent to ours chatting with the younger people there.  It never occurred to them to turn around and ask, \"Do you need anything?\"  I will never go back there.  Horrible experience.  Oh, and we had to ask for our check too.  Smallest tip I ever gave anyone."}
{"text":"It's fine.  Nice diversity in the menu, good service, tasty food.  It just didn't leave any impression on me whatsoever.  If I never ate there again, it wouldn't be missed, if I did eat there again, I would enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch upstairs and I was very pleased with the quality and quantity of the dishes and the service. Lots better than most."}
{"text":"During the three or four times I've been here, I've had friendly service, some decent drinks, and mixed luck with the food. On my last visit, I tried the fish tacos and was sorely disappointed-the tortillas appeared to have been recently revived from the freezer, and the quality of the fish seemed subpar. Still, this is Pittsburgh, so I don't really expect to get decent fish tacos here but like to try occasionally on the off chance that I will succeed. Another failure in my opinion: the fish tacos came with french fries. Who serves fish tacos with french fries?! Maybe if the fries had actually been decent I wouldn't have minded so much, but they were overly salty and soggy.

I've had better luck here with the salads and would recommend those."}
{"text":"I'm still working this one out.  There is some good potential here, though.

The food is pretty good, if a bit predictable.  I like the Pittsburgh Salad, for example - traditional greens, plus grilled chicken an some crispy fries.

Service has been spotty.  Some servers seem to have half the restaurant.  You'll get one shot at a drink. Run out and you're out of luck till the check comes!  A disappointment.  Sitting at the bar results in much better service.

But in an area without many traditional, sit-down restaurants, this one is worth a try.  See how your experience goes and post a review of your own."}
{"text":"For all who are unaware, if you go to Walnut Grill's website and sign up for their mailing list you will receive a coupon for a free dinner or lunch entrée for your birthday.  It's a pretty sweet deal so of course I wanted to take advantage of this offer on my birthday.  We went here for a late lunch after seeing a matinee movie at the nearby cinema.

The restaurant has a lovely outdoor seating area, and it was a nice afternoon to eat and drink outside.  For lunch I opted for the Salmon Balsamico.  It came with marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction.  I kind of think goat cheese, or any cheese on a piece of fish is let's say fishy to me so I scraped it off.  My husband got the same thing adding some sweet potato fries and myself a side salad.  

Service was pretty good, our waitress was attentive, and we didn't wait long for refills.  Our food came out with a normal wait.  I think my husband liked his salmon more than I liked it.  It was cooked well, just thought it could have been seasoned a little better, and the goat cheese, though scraped off lingered on the fish.  I love goat cheese, just not on expensive fish.  If it has cheese on it, it should only be served at a fast food restaurant where you may make claims that it's not real fish.  Speaking of expensive, I thought their prices were a little high verses their portions.  I hate to kick a gift horse in the mouth, but kind of true.


Nevertheless, we had a very nice afternoon at Walnut Grill and was even given free desert a walnut ice cream ball.  This was much more of a treat for my husband than myself since I believe I had a bite or two and he gobbled the rest of it down.  Very nice touch to end my epic birthday weekend."}
{"text":"I love Walnut Grill! I have been here (and the location in Wexford) many of times with both my boyfriend, girlfriends and my family for brunch, lunch, dinner or just wine after work during their Wine Wednesdays (1/2 price bottles HELLO) and have had great service and food every single time!

My first time was for my birthday when I was a freshman in college and their half-baked-gooey-hot-brownie dessert (not sure if they still have it) has left an everlasting imprint in my brain.

This particular location has never been overly packed when I've been here and  that makes it a great place to stop in and grab a bite at any time.  My service has always been excellent and my food has always been great.  Some of my favorites are:

ahi tuna app, spinach and artichoke app, chopped cobb salad, fish tacos, buffalo chicken wrap, and the Sunday buffet (not every item on the buffet is amazing but they do have some pretty good options, IMO)

It's a good place for date night, dinner with a friend or group of friends, brunch with your family or even to stop in and have a drink and dinner alone at the bar!  Interior is modern and always clean.  I really like this place"}
{"text":"I really like the atmophere- they did a great job remodeling! The appetizers were really good, but the rice in my main dish was so uncooked that it was crunchy. The waiter was super nice and I'm going to give this place another try, but the uncooked rice is a rookie mistake and completely ruined my chicken dish. They have happy hour here with 1/2 priced martinis and some other specials."}
{"text":"Walnut Grill is consistently good in both food and service. Brunch is my favorite. I love the outdoor seating in the summer. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a step up from a big chain place and it is fresh and good.  I had the smoked salmon salad and it is always good.  Good drink specials as well.  I haven't had a bad meal yet and always wonder if I will because the place is pretty big.  Usually big places don't pull it off very well, but this place is well run.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to walnut grille for lunch this past Sunday. I know they were busy due to the brunch crowd, but it should not take the server 20 minutes to take your food order. I ordered the lemon caper fish and it was a disgusting pile of mush drowned in butter. I have never seen fresh fish get that mushy before so it had to have been breaded frozen fish. I got a sweet potato as well that was completely black from being burnt and my snow peas were in a pool of butter. For 17.00 I expected a lot more. Our server did not even acknowledge my remark that my meal was gross. I will never patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"I heard great reviews about the Walnut Grill and was excited to try the new restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. I have been to the one in Shadyside a few times and always had a pleasant experience.  Today was not a pleasurable experience. Although the staff was friendly, the food was quite disappointing.  The decor was clean, bright and joyous, with a great flow between different dining sections.  Loved the look of the bar. It was trendy and a central point of the room, but did not overwhelm the space.

The blonde hostess working the lunch shift made my experience.  She was nice, professional, and extremely service oriented. Our server was knowledgeable and accommodating throughout lunch service, but left us waiting for the check, nowhere to be found for a good 10 or so minutes.  

The ahi tuna appetizer was a great light appetizer.  Although it didn't taste like fresh ahi (definitely frozen), it was seared nicely.  The bed of slaw could be a smaller portion.  It was unevenly mixed, meaning large full pepper slices among, small bite-size slivers of cabbage and carrots.  The Spinach and Artichoke dip was oily. I mean a pool of oil in it.  It definitely tasted like they microwaved an old batch.  Although I love large artichoke pieces in my dip, the chips were smaller than more of the pieces. Maybe pita bread would be better suited for this dish. There were too many tortilla chips and crackers for the portion of dip you received.  The tortilla chips were also stale.  The side of sweet potato fries were undercooked and unflavored.  My mother said they usually have a bit of sugar on them, but unfortunately not today.

The 2 women next to us were both upset about their meals. One sent her sandwich back because it was burnt and the other's crab cake was overcooked.


Maybe they have a new daytime chef? Maybe just a bad day? Either way, not for me."}
{"text":"If I could just give zero stars I would. We enjoy Walnut Grill, but not the one in Mt Lebanon. We won't go back until they make major changes. I ordered gluten free cod and baked  potato and the vegetables of the day. Fish, cold and partially raw. Potato was brown inside as it had been cooking probably all day. Vegetables were a pile of mush. Hubby ordered chicken, which was so dried out like leather. His potato was all brown inside but stone cold and wouldn't melt the soft butter they brought. His vegetables were mush. I sent my plate back for a redo.  They took his vegetables back only to replace them with another plate of vegetable mush and another brown potato. He sent all of it away this time as he had tried the chicken and had discovered it was horribly dried out.  The waitress was pleasant enough but very scarce. There was only one other table in the restaurant and two people at the bar.  With food like we were served we now know why there were so few people in there. The manager finally appeared and apologized.  Ha, he offered to comp our meals and we laughed and stated that we had not eaten anything.  He should have given is a gift certificate to try them again,  he did not. And we will not go back to the Mt Lebanon Walnut Grill."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals for drinks and appetizers, but overpriced entrees that keep us from having a full meal here. Outdoor patio is right in the Waterworks Mall, but on a nice day feels like you're not in a parking lot. Could use some attention to detail, like sweeping before the happy hour rush, but generally a good atmosphere for what I describe as an upscale (for Pittsburgh) chain-restaurant-like setting."}
{"text":"I recently had a party here and it was fabulous.  The service was wonderful from start to finish and the food was wonderful
.  The drinks were great, salads superb, and no matter the choice, everyone loved their meals. We were not rushed at all and the servers, came by religiously to refill water and check to see if anything more was needed. I highly recommend this restaurant whether it be for a drink, a meal or a party."}
{"text":"The food was not at all fresh here. Tater tots were clearly frozen. I am confident most of the food had been frozen. The grain bowls were decent. I had a Cobb salad which was decent but mushy and not worth it. We came here with a group of 8 and 6 of us disliked our meal. Corporate crap. We should've eaten at Chili's. Nevertheless the food gets the job done but I would never choose to eat here again."}
{"text":"Good if not great place to get a meal at.  Mom and I were having a girls day out and we decided to stop in here for brunch before heading over to the Phipps. 

The chicken 'n waffles (organic fried chicken in gravy plus waffles) caught my eye as did the eggs benedict.  But I was in the mood for some sweetness.  The  cinnamon swirl French Toast with sausage links was pretty good.  Mmmm, French Toast!  Pump that insulin, Susan.  Pump!  Whoo-hoo!  The cinnamon did give it a nice bite too.  Good thing Rick and I hit the bike trails the day beore.  Mom went for the roasted tomato and bacon frittata, which looked good too.

Many of the negative comments here seem to be about the prices.  The dinner prices look high for what you get, but the brunch prices run about $8.00-$10.00 per entree.  Service here is good though."}
{"text":"The Mt. Lebo Walnut Grill makes me miss the Shadyside version. The shadyside WG was sophisticated and inviting. I was always impressed with the menu and wine selections. I was expecting the same when I walked into the Mt. Lebo WG for the first time. It seems the owners have decided to make WG more appealing to the masses thus loosing it's charm. The bar area was very large and noisy. The restaurant section was much more mellow. For a Friday night, I was expecting it to be busier. only about half the restaurant was full. I decided on a glass of wine from the wine list (averaged 7-12 dollars a glass). After receiving our wine, I ordered the chicken dish with balsamic, tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with my two side choices being the rice and veggie of the day (a broc, caul, bean mix). Our server brought us out a bread basket with a sweet butter with what I believe were cherries in it and a jalapeno hummus. The cherry butter was very tasty. Our meals arrived shorty and I dug in. The chicken breasts were tender and juicy. The sides were flavorful as well. My only criticism of the dish was that the fresh mozzarella was a little difficult to find hidden under the plethora of tomatoes. Service was good. Prices were reasonable. For me, WG's major downfall is the atmosphere. The staff seems to give off a classy and slightly pompous attitude. The menu and decor attempts to appeal to everyone with bar type food as well as more select entrees. It's seems like WG can't make up it's mind. What are you Mt. Lebo WG? A casual, family restaurant or a sophisticated, upscale establishment?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner. The service was great and so was the food. They had chocolate cherry butter and it was delicious. My salad was different but very tasty. It had poached pears in it i would certainly order that again. I had lamb chops and they were devine!  Loved the $4 Long Island iced tea special too."}
{"text":"Walnut Grill is one of my favorite spots for an afterwork drink or a quick, fresh meal. Their menu is American fare with a twist, their wine list is excellent, and the atmosphere is always fun. They recently expanded the bar area to have more seating and comfy booths. The servers remember you if you're a frequent flyer and are always efficient. They have great live music some nights, too! I'll pretty much always be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I think this place is good. The space itself is nice, they have outdoor seating, both covered and uncovered. Went here recently with a large group and our service was really good and our food was also brought out very fast. The food I've had here has ranged from average to good. They have a pretty good happy hour and I believe they do an all-day daily drink special. Overall a solid choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Strawberrry Balsamico Salad is very good. Want something healthy and tasty...This is a great choice as well as the Carmelized Walnut Salad...Nice menu, great lemonade and a variety of healthy and tasty choice. Yes yes yes the burgers are good too"}
{"text":"The food was really awful.  Best part was the drink I had.  Service, bad.  Location great so no excuse!"}
{"text":"This place is alright.  I've never gone for dinner - only for lunch as I worked in the neighborhood.  They don't really have any lunch specials per se and the place seemed completely empty.  The service was friendly, the food was just okay.  Nothing really memorable and the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Nice setting and service, or the quality of the food it was expensive, 2 children, my wife and I was 50.00 including tip, no wines or alcohol on the tab. Service was really good. Would have been 5 stars but food was average my wife had a charbroiled chicken and it was full of gristle, I had a turkey Rachel which was a turkey sandwich with Cole slaw and Russian dressing on rye, the turkey it self was good the rest was not so good. My oldest daughter wanted spaghetti she got buttered noodles. My youngest got chicken strips, who can screw up chicken strips? The kids fries was the shape of a smile face that was cute."}
{"text":"Want good bloody mary's to kick off your Saturday or Sunday morning? Come to Walnut Grill. They throw a jumbo shrimp in it which is awesome. The eggs benedict is terrific!"}
{"text":"While WG has a great patio to enjoy a summer evening, the service is HORRENDOUS!  We waited 10 minutes to be seating, even though there were four empty tables. When we finally sat, we sat and sat and sat. For 15 minutes, we sat even trying to flag down a waiter, to no avail. We stood up and walked out, on our way a waitress approached us and asked if everything was ok...  um yeah!  Done."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Walnut Grill to give their breakfast a try.  I should have taken a few photos to prove that there is truly a place that serves worse food than Applebee's. I have never had lunch or dinner here, and based on my breakfast, I won't be anytime soon.  If you're into snotty eggs, cold fatty bacon, and burnt toast, come on down.  If you're looking for something good, give Eat N Park a go. I do not recommend this place. God, I'm still gagging just writing this review."}
{"text":"A staple of the Walnut Street experience, Walnut Grill has been around forever. The menu changes regularly, which is great because you can always try something new, but is difficult if you are really digging a specific dish. They always have great sandwiches and soups, and the salads are always good. Their balsamic vinaigrette is sweet and delish. 

Went with Rachel C. recently and had one of the regular menu items and one of my fav apps they have ever had-spinach artichoke dip! Large chunks of artichoke and a strong garlic flavor makes this the best spinach artichoke dip in town! A must have when you visit. 

Nice atmosphere, good service at my last visit. Stop hating on Walnut Grill!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here. First time I cane here is when it opened and had the cheese plate which was good as expected for a new restaurant.

We decided to give this place a try and went for the spinach and artichoke appetizer which was delicious but there were huge chunks of artichoke which were yummy but I like then chopped a little finer.
Now what impressed me was the tuna tacos. It actually had slices of raw seared tuna with an Asian slaw and a sweet soy sauce to compliment the tacos nicely. You get three to an order for 12 bucks which was an awesome price. They were just yummy.
My boyfriend got the beef tacos which I did not taste but he said they were perfect and topped with a heaping amount of cheese and mixed veggies. 
I would recommend giving this place a try and can't wait to go again.

As for the staff everyone was friendly it did take a while to get a cocktail but it wasn't absurdly long. They do take reservations which is nice"}
{"text":"We brought some visiting friends here recently, and they were as impressed as I was.  My friend's hubby's Reuben was ruby read in terms of the corned beef, and I'm glad he cut me a piece because it was delish. 

Our app was the fried pickles and they were huge and excellent. We almost couldn't finish them. They came with ranch and marnina.

My entree was the Greek Pasta that had a beautifully green rigatoni (spinach was what made it green) stuffed with feta and dressed with tomato, garlic, olive oil, and baby spinach. Excelente! 

Dessert was the Brownie Works, which is a typical hot fudge brownie sundae, but it was monstrous and it took all four of us to finish! Great service too! Cool interior design as well, very modern."}
{"text":"We just went for lunch, and the strawberry balsamico salad with salmon added was really REALLY good.  I got the smaller portion - wish I had gotten a larger one.  The strawberries were plentiful, and the goat cheese was creamy.  The balsamic dressing was really great.  Overall, a very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have decided to finally take this restaurant off our list since our last 2 visits have been less than positive. Most recently, we made reservations for New Year's Eve for 3 people for 7PM. We arrived about 10 minutes early and still had to wait till about 7:15 before we were seated. During our wait, we sat at an open table near the bar where we proceeded to order a couple drinks. However, the beers listed on the chalkboard menu on the wall weren't up to date. So the server had to keep running back and forth to the bar to verify the available drafts. We finally got to our table and ordered. Although our food showed up in a timely manner, the \"fresh\" veggies were mush and the food was accompanied by gnats. They were flying all over the place, landing on the table, on the wall, my boyfriend spent half the time swatting them away...but it was tough to gain the attention of our server as she was immersed in what must have been a very interesting conversation with a customer nearby. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager reduced our bill. They couldn't move us due to the fact that all the tables had scheduled reservations. Finally, when we had our food boxed up since we didn't want to eat with the gnats, they boxed up and gave us some of the wrong food....it was just comical at that point.

Our visit prior to New Year's Eve happened on a late afternoon on a weekend. We seated ourselves at a booth near the bar. It took almost 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us! Even though there were servers in the area and walking past us multiple times, there was not acknowledgment. When our server finally appeared, she reeked of cigarette smoke...to the point that it was just offensive! We ordered our food and I had the Ahi Tuna, which I wouldn't recommend ordering again because it didn't seem fresh at all. It tasted frozen actually."}
{"text":"They undercooked the steaks for every person in our group.  Service was fine but the kitchen was a joke."}
{"text":"One word...Amazing, the lobster Mac and Cheese, was outstanding. It was my first time, and their will be a second."}
{"text":"We went here for Xmas Eve dinner. We faced something of a challenge because our family consists of 5 adults & 3 children (a 2-year-old & twin 7 1/2-month-olds) & we only had an hour & a half to squeeze in dinner between church & feeding time for the babies. The folks at Walnut Grill couldn't have been more accommodating--high chairs & car seat racks for the babies + candy canes for the toddler. We made it through dinner on time & had a lovely dining experience. My filet mignon was excellent, as was my husband's ravioli. I heard good reports from the other family members on the stuffed flounder, flatbread & gyro. The 2-year-old enjoyed his buttered noodles, too!"}
{"text":"News flash - this restaurant was previously down the road and moved to this location a few years ago, so it's now in the Waterworks plaza area.  I didn't realize this and went to the old location on 1141 Freeport Rd - and saw a Mexican restaurant.  

Not being familiar with the area, I'll admit I was slightly panicked as I had a baby shower to get to at this venue.  Luckily, I was able to call a friend and he told me that they moved and it was down the road close to Chili's.  

It was a great venue to have an intimate gathering such as a baby shower.  It was co-ed baby shower so it was very relaxed and they were serving alcohol - awesome.  I decided not to partake in the alcohol consumption but enjoyed the spread of food they had.  The quesadillas were tasty and so was the hummus.  The spinach-artichoke dip seemed popular but I didn't try it.  

The place is real classy and seemed to be popular for dinner on a Sunday evening.  Although we were in a private room - I took a peek at the restaurant side and saw that it was bumpin.  

Overall the space/decor was great and the food was decent.  Although, I'm not sure that I'd make the trip all the way out here just to go to this place."}
{"text":"The salads were ok. The boneless wings were the worst chicken nuggets I've ever had. And my daughter's mac n cheese was disgusting. I don't understand why restaurants think they can feed crap to kids. Parents taste what their kids order and we judge restaurants on all the food served. I am even more critical of a place that thinks they can cut corners with my children. I wish the food was good, because the service was good."}
{"text":"Meh. A not too dreadful happy hour. Extremely loud with a crowd. Could be located anywhere.  But hey, they sell alcohol."}
{"text":"This place has cockroaches.
People throw up in the booths.
Pretty good white russian."}
{"text":"Always a favorite place food is good staff is great and you can always have Fun. Although they reprinted the menu (it looks like a photo album for a cocktail table) there really aren't that many changes although much to the chagrin of Elyssa they dropped the Tuna Melt. They should add buffalo burgers back on the menu to pick up the overflow from nearby Burgatory, not too many people are willing to wait 2 hours for a burger. It amazes me how they offer $3 draft specials during happy hour you can tell the beer here is alway fresh unlike beer nutz  which seems to never clean their taps. To add bar revenue they should offer the full mixologist specials year round and create a menu just for them. 

I consider this my local place to frequent at least 2-3 times per week!"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour yesterday, surprised by their great specials. The strawberry mojito was so refreshing and the turkey burger was absolutely amazing the simple toppings complimented it so well. Rebecca was our server and she was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. If you go to the Fox Chapel location, request her! We had such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Warrendale (Cranberry, Wexford?) Walnut Grill by literally driving up 19 until I found a restaurant I wanted to eat at.   If I needed a quick blurb to describe the Walnut Grill it would be solid but not spectacular.  If I were to take my parents, who are not adventurous when it comes to food, the Walnut Grill would be a place I would take them. 

Everything I had was good and I had no complaints.  I had the Corn Chowder followed by the a marinated Sirloin, then the Funnel Cake a la mode.  All were nice, but that's about what one should expect.  The menu is not really inventive, and nothing really jumps out as 'must try'. 

I will say that our service wasn't horrible, but a little sub par.  I would've liked our waitress to stop by a couple more times as there were pretty big gaps in her visits, the restaurant was not busy enough to justify the frequency

In summary, if you want safe and solid, the Walnut Grill isn't a bad choice at all."}
{"text":"Do not rent a room for an event. We choose the list of food but when we arrived not only did they \"have to make copies,\" of the paper menu, but there was an item we choose completely missing from it. We also had a sand which on the menu that when ordered was given to our guests on the wrong bread, a basic hoagie roll vs chabata bread.  The prime rib sandwich turned into a pizza shop hoagie; embarrassing.
We brought bakery cookies as they said we could, and an entire box went missing in their back room!  As they repeatedly argued with us that all of the cookies were put out for our guests. The head manager was very rude about it. I will never give them my business again. These were very basic tasks; serve the food exactly as on the menu, have all the food listed, be ready when we arrive and dont loose our desert we bring in! How ridiculous! Finally they put us in a room we did not choose, it was very tight for our guests. A wake for our beloved turned aggravation because this place could not accommodate 25 people."}
{"text":"Came here with a whole bunch of girls on a Wednesday night due to their half-priced wine situation.  Actually, we meant to go to Shady Grove but it was PACKED, so upstairs we trekked to Walnut Grill.

It's dim up there, and has a more formal vibe than shady grove.  The half-priced wine was pretty good, we tried several of the bottles and they were all perfectly decent.  I loved their spinach and artichoke dip, scraping the bottom of the ramekin as best I could to get all the tasty bits.  Our server, who was very friendly and cheerful despite having to deal with such a huge group, recommended the California Pretzel Club.  I have to say, it was pretty good.  Dense, and filling, but I enjoyed it.  The avocado spread was a nice touch.  I couldn't finish it, though I made a good effort on the fries, but my boyfriend polished it off later. 

As the evening progressed, they turned the music up - WAY up - I'd say by 9 pm we had to shout to hear each other.  That wasn't very cool - it's Wednesday and you're serving dinner.  People are here to have conversation, it's not a dance club.  Sorry, but I'm old and crochety (at age 26) and I like to hear what my dinner companions are saying.

The entrees looked pricey, but apps and sandwiches are reasonable.  I'd come back for more half-priced wine and a snack sometime."}
{"text":"Food, blah.  Pierogi with chipotle butter app was terrible- frozen Mrs. T's pierogi in PITTSBURGH is just lazy, and they were drowning in greasy, room temp aforementioned butter which carried heat with absolutely no flavor.  Everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality. Main courses were a cuban sandwich and something I don't recall (bad sign) and were extremely disappointing.

Service, argh.  It was late, but if you're open you're open, right?  Slow, inattentive, wrong sides (which we couldn't correct given the service) an they basically vacuumed around our feet."}
{"text":"I'm not always a chain person, but I love me some Walnut Grill! I used to go to the one in Shadyside, but now that i'm closer to Mt Lebanon I thought I'd check this out.  Say it with me Happy. Hour. Everyday.  YES. $5 small plates and $3 adult bevies win me over.
Service is always fast and friendly.  
I've tried many different things on the menu and have never been disappointed.  My personal favorite is the BBQ Pork Sliders. Delicious.  
I love Walnut Grill and can't say enough good things. It's a definitely a happy hour staple for me!"}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of this place until recently. Management seems to have made an effort to improve service and food quality. I'm not sure what the struggles were in the past, but I'm very happy to see that they have turned it around. I visit about once a week and each time I am happy...this was not the case a year or so ago. If you had a bad experience at WG, give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great location, ambiance, and service. Unfortunately food is the weak link.

Went for Sunday brunch yesterday and ordered the chicken and waffles. Took quite a while to get it to the table.  Waffle batter very plain and not of the Belgian variety that I prefer with sugar granules. If not for the little bit of syrup, it would be incredibly bland. Trader Joes pumpkin and off the shelf Krusteaz waffle batter much better than this. Fried chicken was not bad, but I couldn't but think that it was in the fryer just a tad bit long...

Street parking can be challenging at times."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" The yelp caption already said it all. It looks upscale and nice from the outside but inside, it is just another typical bar with too many empty tables and slow service."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for Mt. Lebanon's WG location.  Highlights were the Strawberry Balsamico Salad and the Caramelized Walnut Ball for dessert.  

The decor is comfortable.  The atmosphere is casual.  The service was good.  

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were great. Menu is full of light, fresh items that are reasonably priced for a slightly more upscale joint. I'm trying hard to not let my experience with a 20 minute wait at lunch time for our check from our often AWOL server to effect my review. I would try again. If I had another disappearing server, I'd be done. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Outdoor deck is excellent for cocktails, good beer, and even Susie b's!  Excellent bar food within a late night menu.  One of the best hang outs in the doc chapel area!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our son's college graduation. From start to finish our experience was great. We all ordered diff dishes and everything was amazing. I had heard good things about the restaurant and our experience lived up to that.  It's a great place for a casual lunch or a celebration."}
{"text":"Great bar and staff.  This place is certainly well run and the service speaks for that.  Service can be a little slow at times, but thats generally when they are damn busy.  The menu doesn't excite me much, but the ambience and weekday happy hour is great.  Largest selection of craft drafts in the area.  They also have a nice outdoor bar and seating to enjoy during the summer months.  Nice place to take a date."}
{"text":"Yummy. I really liked this particular location of Walnut Grill. I visited for the first time a few weeks ago and really enjoyed myself. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.

My boyfriend and I dropped by prior to a networking charity event that we were attending. Neither one of us was particularly hungry so we just ordered apps. I ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which was a rather large dish for an app. It could easily be split between two people. It was so super deliciously yummy. Or yummily delicious, whichever you prefer. :D There was an ample amount of chicken lightly covered in a really great sweet chili sauce along with walnuts, onions, and other things that I forget. You had to put the wrap together yourself, which sort of annoyed me, but they were so good!

Another plus: they randomly had Pumpking! Thank God we got it there that visit because by that weekend it was all gone.

I would chose this location over the others that I have visited because the food was really steps above. Service at all locations has been tremendously pleasant, very good."}
{"text":"Walnut Grill has a nice happy hour and environment. I have not been to the Wexford one but used to frequent the Fox Chapel location. It is a little overpriced for the food. The food isn't bad but for what your whole bill ends up being, you could probably go somewhere nicer. They have a great cocktail I love called a St. Germain Champagne. It's delicious but case in point, it is a $12 cocktail that a suburban restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been to this location. We came dor lunch on a sarurday afternoon.  The service and food was as good as I remember.  I ordered the turkey burger with a side salad.  Our waiter was perfect! I will return!"}
{"text":"This is a lunch time favorite for me and my friends.  I love the salads and the service is always friendly.  I have only been to dinner there once and it was very loud and the service was slower than at lunch.  Overall a place worth trying in Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don't think we will return for a dinner meal again.

I ordered the steak mid-rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side... the salad was terrible, bland, the dressing was barely there and i really question if it was actually a caesar dressing. The parmesan cheese tasted old and well, sorta like it had been shaved off the block of cheese ages ago - it was sort of rubbery and bland as well. My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it. The broccoli served on the side was barely steamed and seasoned with some surprising and awful seasoning. Completely disappointing.  

My husband's salad looked much more appetizing... baby field greens and ranch dressing - he was happy. He asked for a shrimp alfredo which they did make special for him (they have it as chicken alfredo on the menu). I tasted the sauce and it was ok but very thin and could have used more cheese to add more flavor as well as thicken it. He was happy with the meal but admitted to me that Girasole's alfredo was much much better. 

So no, I don't see us heading back anytime soon for anything other than perhaps a bunch meal. I will say that the service was excellent - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and they did a great job but the food is overpriced for the quality of preparation."}
{"text":"I used to love this place; not so much any more.  The food and service has definitely gone down hill over the past year or so."}
{"text":"I've spent many an afternoon/evening at the Walnut Grove in Waterworks - mostly for happy hour, but sometimes for dinner as well.

The happy hour is pretty decent.  Although the prices have gone up since I last visited.  About a year ago, the ahi tuna was included on the half priced apps for happy hour menu.  For $5 you could get a nice sized piece of tuna - but it seems they caught on to the fact that they probably weren't making much money.  

The service is usually OK - nothing special, but not awful either.  The one issue I have is that I just don't love their menu.  Some overpriced salads, a couple of pizzas - 2 are pretty much identical except for the addition of fries (it is Pittsburgh people, fries come on everything!).  A small sandwich selection and some seemingly overpriced entrees.  

I'll give them 3 stars for happy hour, but maybe 2 for the menu and pricing.  But it's a convenient location and an alternative to heading downtown or to Lawrenceville when I'm in town and staying at Bakery Square."}
{"text":"Was there recently for a bridal shower and was not impressed by the service. Granted I know serving a large party can be difficult, plus one of the servers said she was very new (maybe don't put a new server in a large party?). We kept trying to order drinks, cocktails, coffee, water - it didn't matter - you had to ask at least twice if you really wanted it and even then it would take over 20 minutes to get things. We had a pre-selected menu to choose from and everything from it was fine - the walnut salad was the best thing on the menu, really good. The buffalo chicken wrap was okay. But it all would have been lovely if the service would have been better/faster, especially since it was just a lot of drinks and there were only a few choices for food!"}
{"text":"While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu, don't be fooled. We ordered the calamari, mexican pizza, ahi tuna, and french onion soup. While the onion soup was actually good, the rest was awful.

The mexican pizza was greasy, and looks like it was reheated in a microwave, it tasted like cardboard, and looked even worse. The calamari was awful, came with a gross looking/tasting dip. The ahi tuna was actually just mediocre, which was a nice improvement from the rest of the meal. 

If i was a bigger jerk I would have demanded they take the food back, but I just had a bite of everything and asked the waitress to take it back.

I would never eat here again"}
{"text":"So our experience starts with filthy menus. Really Walnut overpriced Grill??? Do you know the median salary of the people you are serving in Fox Chapel with your nasty food stained menus? Anyway, our waiter was very nice Brian. Very attentive. He got our order and special requests correct. The music sucks, the age of your clientele does not fit the genre you are playing. Seriously pay attention to the clientele you are serving. And clean your menus. Food quality, ok. Still small for the price. Better off going to Chilis. Amazing service and great food. Always consistent. Chilis that's is, not Walnut Grill."}
{"text":"Here's the thing that peeves me a little about this restaurant chain.  Why can't they open a restaurant closer to me?  I know that I only have to cross one river to get to the nearest Walnut Grill, but can't they open one up the street from me? :-)!

Me, my family and friends have been to this restaurant many, many times and I can't believe that I have never written a review since it's one of my favorite go-to places.  I think that I have had every single appetizer on the menu, with the exception of the stuffed banana peppers or Seared Tuna Tacos(I just don't like stuffed banana peppers or seared tuna) .  My favorite appetizers are the Pork Dumplings, Fried Pickles and Cheese and Fruit Plate.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices and if you go during their \"Happier Hour\", the prices are reduced to $5 or half.  What's not to like about that?

 My favorite go-to dish is the Wild Mushroom Chicken.  Is it a cutting edge dish?  No, but I still love it and I usually add one of their delicious scrumptious crabcakes to go with it. (I hate crabcakes with a lot of fillers and vegegies.  Theirs has neither and \"I die\" for both dishes.  Also not to be missed, if they have any kind of meat shank in season, just order it , eat it, pay for it and go home to recover from a meat coma.  They're just that good.

My daughter usually orders the Buffalo Chicken Wrap or Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich.  Both are delcious and very filling with your choice of a side dish.

For the desserts, you can't go wrong with the Brownie Works or Walnut Turtle Meltaway.  The devil is a liar if you don't think either of these desserts are yummy!"}
{"text":"I've  been to Walnut Grove several times for every meal (not so much since Burgatory opened across the parking lot, but that's another story).  Each time I've gone, I've had a pretty decent experience, but nothing too amazing.  The food is ok, but depending on who you have waiting on you, the service can be a little spotty (which I suppose is true for any restaurant).

The decor of the restaurant is tastefully done, but to be honest, I preferred the old location further down.  It felt more comfortable and intimate.  The one nice thing this location has to offer is very nice outdoor seating.  There's nothing better than having a couple of beers and making a meal of $5 appetizers on a beautiful evening.  It's just a shame there's nothing really to look at except the parking lot.

I'd say that if you're looking to go, go during happy hour for the drink and appetizer specials or for the Sunday brunch buffet.  It's not worth it so go for the regular menu because I don't think the prices are in line with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I somehow ended up with 2 $15 gift cards for Walnut Grill, but there was a catch: I couldn't use them both during one visit, AND they were only good for the Mount Lebanon location. 

So, on back-to-back nights, we used those gift cards, splurging on meals that had few gaffes. 

Dinner #1 began with fresh bread accompanied by a smoky, piquant roasted pepper hummus, and a sinfully sweet cherry brown butter that was custom-made for pancakes. 

The exquisite Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich came on an elegant baguette and contained candied walnuts, tomatoes, field greens, bacon bits, and pepperjack cheese for for some bite. Flanked by one of their impressive baked spuds and a dijonnaise-smeared, no-filler jumbo lump crab cake that would make Chef Michael Lomonaco grin...

http://www.greatchefs.com/chefs-and-recipes/21-crab-cake/

Dessert was a Funnel Cake A la Mode that was a state-fair treat gone upscale. Topped with chocolate sauce, pureed raspberry, and a gob of vanilla ice cream, it flooded my head with visions of ferris wheels, games of chance, and warm summer nights. 

Dinner #2 started with a fine ranch-dressed garden salad and ended with a mildly delectable Caramelized Walnut Ball that was a twist on the pecan version. Garnished with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, melted caramel, and a fanned strawberry, it served as a pleasant end. The middle, however, proved to be a battle. The Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich, also served on a baguette, was filled with magnanimous levels of protein as well as hot pepper rings, mushrooms, and provolone and couldn't be eaten by hand. In such posh surroundings, one doesn't tackle such a grinder without the use of silverware. The fact that a greasy, guilt-ridden pleasure can be had at Walnut Grill is somewhat mystifying, the crispy edges of each flap of prime rib taking me to the streets of Philly with a chip on my shoulder. 

The service during our first meal was stellar all 'round, but the second time, there was a noticeable decline. We were not given the complimentary bread. Refills and our check required a bit of a wait despite the house not being very busy, and a number of the listed menu items I was interested in (the Chocolate Cobbler, for example) were no longer available according to the server. 

Nonetheless, Walnut Grill still exceeds expectations. I only wish those gift cards were good at the Bridgeville satellite so I could hit up that one. Hell, at least the parking's free over there."}
{"text":"Nice inviting atmosphere for a casual restaurant and bar.  Walk into the relatively large bar with mucho TV's.  A small dining area in front and a large dining area behind the bar.  About a dozen drafts on tap and more wines by the glass.  This is part of the Walnut Grove group.  The menu is similar (I think), but have not been to any of the others. The menu for lunch had many choices and it looks like you can create your own salad but my server was new, was not sure and did go and check on that.   Many different topping and dressings are available for you salad.

Ordered the WG\"s Crab Cake which seemed to need a little seasoning.   The crab cake was a good size with plenty of crab meat.  My associate had the Roasted Beet Salad.   Was able to get a bite because it was huge.  Tasty roasted beets with caramelized walnuts, gorgonzola with a herb balsamic vinaigrette,  The beets were good with the gorgonzola, but the caramelized walnuts  were a little to sweet and stuck to my teeth."}
{"text":"The walnut Grille definitely has a nice atmosphere and ambiance about it. I do think it's a little pricey for what the food is composed of. I got a watermelon feta salad ($7 lighter portion). It was good but it was lettuce with a couple chucks of watermelon and feta. Next time, I would not get a small salad for $7, I'd spend a couple dollars more and buy a sandwich with fries. I also ordered the hibiscus martini ($11). It wasn't very good tasting and it was strong, so it probably would be good for people who like a stronger exotic drink! We waited a really long time for our food, about 30 minutes, which was frustrating because we had another event to go to afterwards. I was also given the walnut salad instead of the watermelon feta that I ordered, in which I had to wait another 5-7 minutes to get. I did like that there were wine bottles filled with water at our table, so I never had to ask for a refill. Also, I talked to the server and manager about my 15% off discount through yelp if I check in and they not only never saw it, but said that I should show them it when I get my bill and they will try and figure it out. It always bothers me when companies aren't aware of current promotions and deals going on within their business. They did honor the coupon when I got my receipt. I would try this place again for lunch but over all wasnt impressed with my first visit."}
{"text":"Happy hour Monday thru Sunday? Count me in! We were pleased to find not only the last two seats at the bar on a Saturday evening during a pens game, but that there was also happy hour going on. $3 drafts, $4 long islands, $5 house wine and a variety of apps on special. Easily the best news all week!

I ordered a brand new menu item, a harvest bowl with flavorful sauteed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, Roma tomatoes, carrots, almonds and full grain rice. Everything tasted like it was picked minutes before and prepared naturally. This review doesn't do the meal justice. I'm thinking about going back as I'm writing this now!

Service was quick and friendly and everything came exactly as we requested. I can't say enough about my experience. Head in and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Came to walnut grill for dinner and ordered to start two appetizers and a martini. For our appetizers we had the Brussels sprouts and the calamari. Both were good. The Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and drizzled with balsamic and cheese crumbles. The dipping sauce is a good match as well that comes with it. I highly recommend them. The calamari was good, not the best I have had but good. They could have been a little more crispy and seasoned, but I would order them again. The Bellini strawtini drink was so good. It was made with champagne and came with a fresh strawberry on the side. Not too sweet which made it perfect. For my main meal I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon. I like food with a little kick to it so I requested the salmon to be cooked blackened which they did with no problem. It was definitely a good Caesar. I would next time get the dressing on the side. Was a little too much dressing for me. Overall it was a great food experience."}
{"text":"I attended the Walnut Grill, Fox Chapel location for the first time today for a special event. The event was hosted in a private room that was large enough to hold about 30 guests. We had our own wait staff and a menu that was catered to the event. 

We were greeted by friendly waiters who took drink orders from us immediately. When it was time to select from our lunch menu, I decided to choose the Parmesan Crusted Chicken & Gnocchi (see photo attached) with a Caesar Salad - both of which are on the restaurants regular menu. The meal was brought out promptly by our servers and was delicious!

I will definitely be back to try the full menu at some point, but for now-I can recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to host a small-medium sized private event as we had a great experience! The worst part about it was having to get in & out of the Waterworks parking lot :)!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the our waitress was wonderful. She was attentive and personable and kind.

However, the food was not good at all. I ordered my filet mignon rare to medium rare and it was overcooked. Not pink/red in the center but mostly brown with a little pink. One of my companions ordered the sea bass and from bite #1, she was picking bones out of her mouth. She tried to eat it in a few different places and every area was filled with bones. She sent it back, the waitress apologized profusely and the chef came out to tell her he was making her another piece, this time from the tail. Apparently that's the area of the fish with no bones. However, this is also the flat, unappealing area of the fish. The new piece came out about 4 inches thinner than the original piece and was tasteless. We both chose sides that we didn't like either. The vegetable medley was cold and the mashed potatoes were bland. Her spinach was so garlicky, there was no spinach taste to be found.

Our other companion ordered the fish tacos and lobster mac & cheese and both of those dishes was delicious, though!"}
{"text":"What an awful experience - My husband and I rarely go out to eat, but we decided to make a special trip out for our anniversary and let me tell you, I wish we would've just stayed in. Where do I even start...?

We got to the restaurant at around 8PM Our waitress name was Kim (I think??) - She started off by telling us that she is super tired because she's been working all day.... Oh..  Jeeze. Way to make me feel  bad for being here, I apologized to her and began ordering. 

The food came out a full 40 minutes after we ordered (there was literally 8 other people in the whole restaurant, so it's not like it was packed) My husband ordered a steak medium well - The meat should be light pink with gray-brown surrounding the center -  it was so extremely obvious that the cook forgot the steak on the grill due to the color of it being completely black - We both kind of laughed when she set the plate down because it felt like a joke. How could someone send this out of the kitchen? It was charred! Like a marshmallow that was on fire. Completely unacceptable. He let the waitress know that it was entirely too overdone and would like them to try again - She talked about how it was \"getting late\" and said \"yeah, the chef here tonight isn't very good\" - What?! Who would say that to people paying money to eat there! The next came out still overdone, but not quite as bad and we didnt even want to say anything about it - I just wanted to leave... The waitress brought the bill to us before asking if we wanted anything else - Trying to redeem the night, my husband said \"actually, may we see a dessert menu? - She seemed so aggravated that we wanted dessert and started talking about how the section we were sitting in shouldnt really have anyone sitting there at this time because she had to prepare for the next mornings buffet and hinted to us that if we were going to stay for dessert that we should move to another section? When I said \"did you want us to move??\" she said \"well.. It would be unprofessional for me to ask you to move... but...\" and just stood there... I was so confused and felt very weird and uncomfortable - She then changed her mind and told us to stay where we were. ok...? We got a chocolate cake to split, which we both hurried through because we felt like she didn't want us there anymore (even though there was still 2 hours until they closed...) We let her know that we were ready for the bill - She set the bill down in front of my husband and as he was getting his card out we started talking about something that happened at work to him that day, he didn't put his card down right away since we were talking she came right back and looked at the bill still on the table and said \"oh, I thought you were ready to leave??\" Both my husband and I just sat there shocked she would say that, I apologized, and I told her that we got into a conversation and she didnt even acknowledge that I spoke, my husband gave her his card and she walked away. I wanted to run out of there crying because we wasted a night out (let alone an anniversary dinner) on this place.
I will never go here again, and I have told everyone I know about this since then - It really bothered me and I wanted others to know about is so that they don't waste their hard earned money and precious time."}
{"text":"Overall: poor service, overpriced, nice atmosphere, food was blah to average. I won't go back and would not recommend to others. 

We attended the Fox Chapel Walnut Grill for brunch on Father's Day. The hostess took our party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child) to our booth which was near enough to the buffet area for easy access but secluded enough not to be bothered by the traffic. None of us had been to this restaurant before and we were unfamiliar with the setup, especially for the brunch buffet. I asked the hostess if we needed to wait to place drink orders and where the buffet was located. She waved in the direction of another dining area where the buffet was setup and said everything is in there and walked away. We sat for a few minutes and the waitress came to the table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We asked what the choices were, as we didn't have menus, and she seemed confused by this question. She asked if we wanted menus and I said we're here for the brunch buffet but can you tell us the drink options. She then said they had Coke products. My husband asked for sweetened tea - they didn't have it. She ended up bringing menus and said we could order from the menu or get the buffet - we didn't know this was a choice as most restaurants serving a special brunch buffet do not also have kitchen service (except for special orders). We took a look at both the buffet and the menu and decided to go for the buffet since that's why we actually came. It's important to note that online the buffet is $17.95 for adults and $6.95 for kids and includes a made to order omelette bar; however, for Father's Day (and possibly other special occasion holidays) it's $23.95 for everybody and there is no omelette bar. Soft drinks and coffee are also extra by the way. I felt the buffet offerings were very limited compared to other brunch buffets, and the area where it's setup was very crowded and cramped. Minimal vegetarian options -fruit tray, garden salad, seafood salad, pasta salad, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, pancakes and French toast sticks. There was also prime rib, some chicken dish, pork bacon and sausage, and a pastry/dessert section. There were no turkey or vegetarian breakfast meat substitutes. I ended up with pancakes (very dry), fruit, and potatoes. We found out after noticing the made to order omelette bar was missing (which our waitress didn't mention) that we could get omelettes made in the kitchen. They had 3 choices: Denver, Veggie and Seafood. The waitress was clearly unknowledgeable about the items being served, I asked what came in the veggie omelette and she said bell peppers, onions and cheese. I said perfect I'll take that with cheddar cheese. She told my dad the same thing but actually told him it came with cheddar cheese standard. My daughter ordered the seafood (crab, shrimp and tomatoes), hold the tomatoes add cheddar. None of our omelettes had cheddar cheese but came with mozzarella (which I personally can't stand with eggs) and the \"crab\" was actually imitation crab (something important for the server to note I think). Furthermore, the veggie omelettes actually came with red and green peppers (no onions) but also spinach and mushrooms. This was not the combo I'd ordered. Anyway, the server was nice but not a very good waitress in my opinion. For $140 I expect both good service and good food, if you feel the same I would not recommend the Walnut Grill brunch."}
{"text":"I keep going back to Walnut, hoping things will change, but they don't. I wish I could give them no stars, but I can't. 

We went in for happy hour Friday. The drink specials are great, with $3 glasses of house wine and $3 drafts. BUT that's where it ends. We sat at a bar table for 2 hours and only received three rounds. The service was that bad. And to top it off, we were charged full price for our last round. We had been searching for the server for at least 30 minutes, but she doesn't show up until happy hour was over. 

We had the chicken and cheese quesadilla that night too. Wasn't good, wasn't bad. Just your average grilled chicken and bagged shredded cheese. 

The next night we had reservations for Il Pizzaiolo and showed up a bit early, so we ran over to walnut for a quick drink. There was only ONE other table occupied in the bar, and no one sitting at the bar. It took 5 minutes for a server to give us menus. I ordered a Sauvignon blanc, but informed they were out of it. The server then read off a list of every alcohol they were out of; there were about 10 things listed. If you ask me, that's not good business and not a good sign. 

Anyways, we order our drinks. Scott's father orders a negroni. The server writes it down, only to show up 5 minutes later confessing she has no idea what the drink is. Why not just look it up on your cell phone?  Oh well. We continue to wait another 15 min with no drinks. The one bartender was flipping through a magazine and the other was organizing straws. Sitting there with no drinks, watching this, is very frustrating. 

After about 20 minutes got up to leave since our reservation was close. We informed them that they should cancel our order. We received dirty looks from both bartenders and the manager who was sitting at the bar drinking a cocktail. The one bartender yelled out, \"here's the Guinness!\" As if that would get us to stay. We ordered a beer and three glasses of wine (Scott's dad took back the negroni order after they admitted they couldn't make it).  That should take 3 minutes to get together. 

Overall we were very disappointed. We give this place second chances over and over. But this was it. The service gets no stars and the food gets maybe 1 star. Previous visits for dinner resulted in inedible meals. It's too bad because who wants to pass up $3 glasses of wine?!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on my wife's birthday.  When we first parked outside of the restaurant we saw that they had outdoor sitting and an outdoor bar.  It looked nice.  Luckily it was sunny out and a nice day so we decided to sit outside.    The inside looked nice and it was big but you can't beat sitting outside in the warm weather for lunch.


     They let us sit wherever we wanted outside.  You could either sit at the outside bar, you could sit on their high table tops, or they had regular sized tables to sit at as well.  At first we sat on a high top but the table was a little too small for us so we settled for a regular sized table.  The outside area that we were in was covered but they had an uncovered area too in the back.  It was really nice and relaxing outside.  The Sam Adams Oktoberfest was out early so we both ordered the Oktoberfest.  


     They gave us a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  We were hungry but it was lunch time so we decided to go for the lunch menu.  The lunch menu is basically the dinner menu just with smaller portions.  I ordered the Salmon Balsamico with a side of sweet potatoes fries and my wife got the same thing but she got a side of vegetables and a side salad.  I really liked my salmon.  It had marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction in it.  The sweet potatoes fries look great and some of the fries tasted really good.  The problem was most of them weren't cooked long enough so they were a little hard in the middle.  The fires that were done were excellent.  I decided to take them home and I warmed them up to make them softer and that worked!  


     My wife had a coupon for her birthday so it was a buy one meal get one free.  You really have to sign up for things like this for your birthday if you don't already.  It really saved us a lot of money for her birthday weekend.  Since she had this coupon they knew it was her birthday so the waitress asked if she would like a free Caramelized Walnut Ball.  My eyes got really big because I knew my wife doesn't eat dessert so this would really be for me!  It was a nice gesture from them to give us a free dessert for her birthday.  I did give my wife a bite or two of the walnut ball but I inhaled the rest of that dessert!


     Overall we had a really nice lunch date for my wife's birthday.  We sat around after lunch and had a few more beers to enjoy the weather and each other.  It was great.  If I could go back I would have probably just ordered from the dinner menu to get more food but I was still happy with the portion of my salmon."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for brunch on the weekend. I went here expecting to order off the menu, but was informed they have a brunch buffet. After looking at the menu, there was nothing that I appealed to me. Most of the items did not sound appetizing or were too expensive, so that left me with brunch.The service was good. The waiter came and and cleaned the plates and refilled our drinks throughout the meal. 

The brunch was better than I expected, but not great. They had a carving station with prime rib. The prime rib was very fatty and cooked to a medium rare. Their Greek salad was very fresh. The rice pilaf was hit or miss. One batch was great, very flavorful while another batch was tasteless. Finally the cookies were great while I did not care for the apple cobbler or the brownies. Other items for brunch included - fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, home fries, Eggs Benedict, bass in a curry sauce and chicken parmesan.

Overall it was an okay place for brunch. The items for brunch were either good or okay, nothing was amazing. I feel for $18.00 I could have gone elsewhere for a better meal. I don't think I will come back here."}
{"text":"I was here with family tonight! I'm always thrilled and excited to be here at the walnut grill. Food was good as the usual. Service, was awesome. It was a little quieter than the normal noise but I like quiet. It was easier to here the people. Cnt wait to go back. Even l, the manager came out to our table and asked how we are wow! Also, they redeemed the yelp coupon. Definitely dine in hopefully soon"}
{"text":"I'm seriously confused at why people hate on this place so much.  Maybe the service/food can be iffy at times, but today it was great!  I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I felt like I had to try the food again to write a proper review.  

We got the \"best seat in the house\" according to the host.  That actually means the seat by the window so you can people watch.  Everything looks good on the menu, so I opted for a little bit of everything.  I started with the cauliflower soup.  I didn't know what to expect, but it came as pureed with a cheesy taste to it.  It was amazing!  I asked the server what was in it and she said it was cream cheese.  Mystery solved, cream cheese makes everything better!  

I also tried the beat salad.  I loved the fact that there was golden and red beets in it.  I just wish there were more, although I always feel that way about beet salads at restaurants it seems.  The main course was the Walnut Crusted Salmon with Bread Pudding and Apple Buerre Blanc.  It was really tasty.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, which meant not over cooked at all, and the bread pudding/apple buerre was really delish!  

Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and I really couldn't ask for a better meal.  I've been won over and I'd definitely go back...and try ten things again:)"}
{"text":"I have never experienced slower service than I did at Walnut Grill in Waterworks. My family and I went at 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't get out of there until after 2:30. That's ridiculous! All we ordered was the lunch combo of soup and salad. How hard is that to make? The area where we sat had multiple empty tables around us, so it's not like the place was packed. Also, the French Onion soup was awful. Super sweet and I could tell it sat around forever before it was served to us because the cheese on top was one big solid mass that was basically inedible. So, in short, my family and I were there for two hours and all we got was half of a caesar salad and some yucky soup. Do yourself a favor and drive to the next plaza and eat at Zoup! That place is awesome, cheaper, and much much faster."}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  I would call it a \"finer diner\" in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees we have all had before.
The food is good though; however you're paying for the location and decor (which, in our opinion, was kind of out-dated).  We started with the mushroom flatbread that was a bit on the sweet side; however it was loaded with mushrooms which is a huge plus.
I had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and Jordan had the reuben.  The salmon was very light and tasty and Jordan's corned beef was sliced real thick.  French fries are pretty standard.
All in all, I guess this is where the rich people of ShadySide get their diner food: same kind of food, just a fancier ambiance than Denny's.  
We will be back when we want something comforting but dont want to be surrounded by teenagers and want something better than Eat 'N Park."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends of mine last night and had a great time. Our server was attentive and friendly. I had their classic burger with sweet potato fries and the burger was cooked the way I like it and tasted great. 
They also have a great craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"I didn't find the food all that flavorable, the service isn't great, and it's definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"The late night 9-11p menu is well worth the trip - 1/2 off flatbreads + boneless wings. If you time it just right and down a couple $4 Long Island Iced Teas...you, too, might become part of the off-shift entertainment."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by and sampled some of the appetizers. BBQ chicken pizza was large and was very tasty. The charcuterie plate was very well put together with ample amounts to taste. Smoked blue cheese was the best . Chicken lettuce wraps were nice sized and really tasty as well. Last sample was the Brussel sprouts and they were pretty good. Lots of balsamic glaze on them and it covered up a lot of the dish. Service was very nice, everyone was helpful and cordial."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here, but you know what, that was 100% because of the awesome, drunk conversation, all we had was draft beers.  We had 4 for 14$, that doesn't seem too expensive to me.  It was also happy hour when I went there:  half price appetizers (which I didn't eat any of, but were still very exciting).  I have no comments on service, food. or cocktails, and somehow I still really liked it in there!  The bathrooms were CLEAN.  Actually when I went to the bathroom I thought \"these bathrooms are CLEAN!\""}
{"text":"The fiancée and I hit this place up for a light lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  They apparently were short-staffed but the bartender/waitress we had managed to take care of us quickly as well as 5 additional tables.  All this while making drinks for the rest of the waitstaff...good job!  She said she just got back from vacation and a little out of it but she was still on the ball.

We both had Cucumber Mules and the bartender did a great job on those as well.  They had a nice bite to them and I guess that was the ginger beer.

She had a Carmelized Walnut Salad and a California Turkey Wrap from the Pick a Pair promotion.  The salad was *very* fresh and tasty she said with slightly too much balsamic: 4/5.  The California Turkey Wrap was too dry for her taste.  It would have been better with more honey mustard sauce or guac: 3/5.   I had the Blackened Salmon BLT with fries.  The sandwich was great...perfectly cooked to my liking.  The fries were the battered style and were also delicious:  5/5.

We will definitely be going back.  Total bill was $47.03"}
