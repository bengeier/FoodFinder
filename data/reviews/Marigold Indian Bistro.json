{"text":"Went in for dinner with the family, quaint restaurant with amazing food, make sure you try the lamb it's a ten. Desserts were a hit with the kids and we will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"I order often and it is very good ! Only ever had takeout but tasty lamb korma and butter chicken."}
{"text":"Wow! The search is over!  I have now found my 'go to' Indian delivery in midtown Toronto. I had pretty much given up finding great Indian food in the central area , thinking that we had to go to the outer suburbs to find it. I'm glad to say, that this isn't the case!  The lamb korma was delish, everything was good but the butter chicken was a tad sweet for me, that said, I'll probably it again. The 'meal deal' a great value and tons of food! Excited for my next order."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here with a Groupon and were so impressed. We agreed it was definitely the best Indian food we've had in the city and would strongly recommend it to anyone. The servings were so generous, I couldn't wait to eat my leftovers the next day!! The service was also excellent and the atmosphere was comfortable. Will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"when I read the positive comments, I thought I was in for a real  treat. 

The restaurant small, but nice, good staff, but the food - very disappointing. Had the stir fried veggies which mentioned tofu in the menu, there was none in our dish. I have never tasted such incredibly bland and totally flavorless vegetables. The shrimp dish must have had like 4 or 5 shrimp and just lots of sauce - I would say the sauce would take up at least half the dish. Even though the waiter kept stressing certain dishes were very spicy, I found the opposite - no spiciness at all. I guess I understand maybe some people are more sensitive to even a tiny bit of chilli. The way he kept stressing how spicy certain dishes were - we thought should we even order these? I would have never guessed there was any chili pepper, .. at all in those dishes.

I must admit the lamb dish was very good (thus the extra star), beautifully flavored and it did have very tender lamb chunks and wasn't just half a bowl of sauce. There are many great Indian restaurants in this city, I just wouldn't consider this one of them."}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight! 
Highly recommended. Great price point for the quality and presentation. A true neighbourhood gem. The butter chicken, eggplant dish and naan bread are some of the best I have tried.  My date was very impressed- and she knows how to cook! 
Impressive thoughtful wine list also."}
{"text":"The butter chicken was to die for! It was so amazing, the lamb masala was good too but I'm a bigger fan of butter chicken. Naan was hot and fresh, and service was amazing, I've never been so happy to tip! The decor was also very classy, and the food was not over priced at all! The best part was I dined with a groupon, so for $15 I got 2 dishes and naan bread, which is really great. I would be happy to return and I would not mind paying regular price at all, because even the regular price is quite reasonable."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place as I've been eyeing it for a long time and I was blown away! It was really amazing, the food was so flavourful, the meats were very well cooked, everything was delicious. We got takeout and I was also very happy to see that the containers were filled to the top, we had enough dinner for at least 2 nights! Definitely my new go-to for Indian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Marigold last night, and we were very impressed. From the get-go, we were promptly greeted, seated, and offered beverages. When we ordered, our server actually suggested that we may have ordered too much for two, but we still decided to go with everything we chose, and we did not regret it!

Here's what we had:

Naan - plain and garlic - crispy, soft, warm, and amazing. I recommend the garlic one, as it's not overpowering, but just spiced enough.

Vegetable Samosa - 2 samosas. Fried, but not heavy. Delicate flavours and great dipping sauces.

Pakoras - Also fried, but so yummy. Quite a large serving, so great for sharing.

Butter Chicken - On the mild side, and quite sweet, but still very flavourful. Was great with naan.

Kofta - A spinach vegetarian dish. Very mild, but tasty. My husband really enjoyed it.

We opted to skip rice this time, but will come back to try the biryani. 

Overall, the service was superb, the renovated space is elegant and very welcoming, and the food is very well-presented and just delicious. It's a great neighbourhood spot, and we'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm an expert when it comes to Indian cuisine and sadly Marigold missed the mark   
While the Tikka tofu  and Palak paneer was good, it was nothing special. The briyani, mushroom curry and eggplant tasted way too heavy with masala which frankly overpowered the entire meal. Very disappointed, definitely won't be going back. There are many other restaurants that satisfy my palette when I'm craving excellent Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken, beef vindaloo, garlic naan and basmati rice. Best dinner I have had in a while. It was orgasmic."}
{"text":"Given all the positive reviews online I was excited to give this restaurant a try! Went for dinner a few days ago and found it disappointing. After being seated with menus we waited a good 15 minutes before the waiter even acknowledged us. When we finally got around to ordering and asked the waiter questions about the menu, he did not seem knowledgable - we wanted to know if we could order the chili paneer as a main course rather than appetizer because they had that option on the website. He brushed it off and said their menu had changed and that it was only available as an appetizer. He later returned to tell us differently (that it was still available as a main course). This was a minor ordeal but it was too late to change our order.  The service was impeccably slow. Despite the restaurant not being busy it took over 30 minutes for our appetizers to come. The appetizers were mediocre at best - dry and bland. Our main course took about another 30 minutes. Without appetizers we would have been starving! The main courses were also disappointing. I've had much better indian food at other restaurants and this was far from the best. Our glasses were not refilled with water throughout the entire meal. The waiter did not come to see if the food was ok or if we needed anything. However we did note the waiters and other staff socializing behind te counter. Unacceptable service. The waiter also did not bring us our bill or clear our table until we asked for the bill. They did not offer a dessert menu or coffee or tea. Bottom line - I've had much better indian food for cheaper at other restaurants with much much better service. If you're looking for fine dining with good service don't  bother going to marigold. For the price I would've expected much better."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The food is fresh and delicious! We shared plates and I enjoyed it all. The Naan bread was great along with the saffron rice. Everything was beautifully served. The chana masala was so yummy and of course, the butter chicken was excellent. My only complaints were that the restaurant is very small and the service is quite slow. However, the staff are extremely polite, welcoming and accommodating. The price is in line with other Indian restaurants. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week and it was just a lovely experience. The food was very good - light and even the dishes that were sauced up tasted fresh. It was served quickly and presented well. The service was attentive without being intrusive. Like the best family-owned restaurants there are one or two people there who must be relatives because they weren't hired for their experience :-). But even they were charming. And the ultimate test of customer service: we used a groupon and still felt we got VIP service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Toronto!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My family loves Indian food and we have been eating it around the city for years. Now that we have found Marigold we won't go anywhere else. We travel from far downtown for the outstanding saag paneer, naan, butter chicken, chat and the fabulous service! We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Well, this USED to be my go-to neighborhood Indian restaurant. Until last night. When I found an insect that I think was a dead baby fly in our take-out saffron rice. No thank you."}
{"text":"Fantastic little neighbourhood resto. Great food and service, very nice ambiance. Will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out. All food is totally delicious. I ordered Chicken Biriyani which is excellent, lentils and the vegetables in cashew sauce."}
{"text":"Great place. We ordered delivery for two and paid about $50.00. You can also dine in the restaurant but I do not like to dress up (I am from a small town and feel out of place in a collared shirt, tie, and black pants). They have done a nice job making the restaurant interior look trendy and urban-elegant so there is an implied semi-formal dress code. 

We ate the onion bhaji, saffron rice, garlic naan, chicken madras, and beef rogan josh. The portions were large and worth the price.

No problems with the rice or the naan, if you are a fan of Indian food you'll like them. 

The chicken madras was not as spicy as I had thought it would be, but they had used a bit of yoghurt to tone down the heat which was fine because it tasted amazing even without the anticipated spiciness. I would usually order the lamb rogan josh, but decided to try the beef rogan josh. This was a mild dish rich in flavour. The dried kashmiri chilies gave the dish a nice fire-like colour and it was my favourite part of the meal.

We also had two cans of Diet Coke which were chilled nicely."}
{"text":"We 2 just returned from this restaurant and were very pleased with the food and service. The room is modern and attractive with comfortable seating. The servings were very generous and enough to even take home an extra helping. I had the lamb and my partner had chicken.  Both were delicious.  The appetizer and dessert were ample enough to share for 2.  The wine glass was 250 ml.. Prices were more than reasonable. This is a place I  will definitely return to.  Excellent in every way!"}
{"text":"I LOVED eating at this place, I'd do take out every week and it was consistently delicious.

However today I ordered my usual. The naan was black in some parts and in others very much raw dough. One of the papadam pieces had a hair baked into it. And finally, the sauce that was normally a beautiful consistency was watery. Unfortunately I ate the better portion of it before realizing I nearly ate a hair, and for that reason I will no longer be coming back. I'm a little worried that there may have been something wrong with it and I really hope I don't end up sick as a result of eating it."}
{"text":"Indian food in a mid-upscale setting, I was introduced to Marigold by a friend who lives nearby.  If not for her recommendation, I might have missed this place - so thanks K, cause Marigold is delicious. 

Had no problems finding a table for 4 on a Wednesday night, and the staff was incredibly helpful in describing menu items.  Granted with the responsibility to order plates for the entire table (heavy is the crown...), I was going to add king prawn xacutti to the list of dishes I had already chosen.  The gentleman suggested that since the xacutti is very similar in taste to the seafood curry, that he might be able to ask the kitchen to do a prawn masala instead to switch up the taste. 

It ended up being our favourite dish of the night.  The prawns were really big; much bigger than those \"jumbo\" shrimp you get at other places sometimes.  Full of flavour, succulent shrimp, creamy consistency...yum, I totally want some right now.  I love butter chicken, but this one easily trumped it that night. 

Actually, the butter chicken is what originally brought me here as my friend said it's the most delicious she's ever had.  I think it's made up of chunks of chicken breasts, in a reddish brown butter chicken sauce that's a little less on the creamy side and heavier on the spices and chicken flavour.  

Other hits with us that night were the garlic naan and the free round of pre-dinner pappadums. 

The naan is the size of a small plate, so if you opt to forego rice, order at least one naan per person.  You might find yourself wanting even more to devour every last tasty drop!"}
{"text":"I think people are over rating this place based on atmosphere. The food here is mediocre at best. My bf and I ordered the deal for two, choosing butter chicken, chicken tikka, and bhaingan bharta. Too much sweet and fruitiness in all the food and not enough of the flavor and spice that caters to an Indian food craving. The butter chicken was standard, tikka wasn't anything special, and the bhaingan bharta had way too many peas. I also highly disagree that the portions are \"generous\". I've gotten much better indian food and much larger portions for the same price at Banjara."}
{"text":"We have found our new Indian.  In the neighbourhood for five years and didn't know about it.  Food was delicious, a little pricey and the wait staff were lovely.  Great meal and ambience!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to find this place!  Order for the first time two weeks ago and order again this week. Both times were great. Large portions at a reasonable price, especially if you order the meal for 2, which includes an app, 2 meat dishes, one veggie dish, 2 naans and rice. A ton of food!  Great quality, meat was very fresh and tender. Lamb especially was good which can be hit or miss at some places.  Chicken Biriyani and Lamb Korma are our two favourites. Website is fantastic and allows easy delivery.  A new staple in our order-in repertoire!"}
{"text":"Oh my god amazing food with best service ....this restaurant gonna leave all other indian restaurant behind who r claiming to be best"}
{"text":"Ordered Rogan Josh and Naan takeout. Container was half-filled with curry which had been thinned with tomato puree; our $13.50 curry had five small nuggets of meat in it. Naan was smallish and overcooked. 

Overpriced by a sight. Will not order again."}
{"text":"Take-out experience
Overall: 3.5/5
Taste: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Value: 3/5

Garlic naan: $3.25. Not worth the price. Soggy, paper-thin, tasteless. 
Beef vindaloo: $16.95. Very spicy. 
Coconut prawn curry: $18.95. Mild and tangy. 

Overall, tasty dishes with small portions."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian delivery! I always order on UberEATS, and it's ALWAYS so good! 

My go-to favs are the samosa's, butter chicken, tikka masala, and the cumin rice! 

I can't comment anything about the restaurant or service, as I've only ever had the delivery, but based on my experience with the food, I would definitely go, and will continue to order from here and explore the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout from this restaurant for the first time recently. It was absolutely delicious! However, we were told it would take no more than 60 minutes to arrive and it ended up taking one hour and 20 minutes, which we found very disappointing, given that we live one block over. We had given them a call at the hour and ten minute mark to ask when it might be arriving and there was no apology. We also found the value for money to be a little disappointing, especially in the meat dishes. Next time we may try either picking up or eating in the restaurant to compare experiences, but we will continue to try out other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Upon entering Marigold  we were promptly greeted and seated.  It was a Saturday night, around 6:00 pm.  There were many seats still available. The place filled up at 6:15.  They have a groupon going on (we didn't go that route) and most customers were taking advantage of it.   We chose the meal for 2, which was $39.00 and included 2 appies, 3 mains, rice or naan and dessert.  The service was very good, the waiters were very helpful and professional. I would give the service 5 stars! We also ordered a bottle of wine, which was really tastey and very well priced.  They only mark their bottles up by $10, which is very rare these days.  The food wasn't as tastey as we hoped, mainly lacking in flavour, and salt.  The ingredients were fresh and nice quailty,  it just needed more flavouring.  I'm glad we tried it, and the exprience was nice.  Probably wouldn't return though.  My preference would be the Copper Chimney or Amaya."}
{"text":"I really really really feel like a horrible person for doing this, but my three star review will ruin their perfect score. I'm not proud of this, but I have to be honest.

The service is 5 stars alone and the servers were especially patient when we couldn't decide what to order or how to choose from our Groupon menu or the price fixe menu. We had purchased a Groupon for 4 ppl, but only 3 were present, so they wouldn't let us use it. I don't see what difference it makes as they're still making the same money whether or not we take some of the food to go, but they claimed this was policy.

We decided on the Chicken Tikka, Vegetable Samosa and the Chaat to begin, followed by the Saag Paneer, Lamb Rhogan Josht, Chicken Chettinandu, and the Beef Vindaloo. This ended up being the price fixe for 2 but we added a person for $17.95.

The wine is a fabulous deal, although a bit misleading. Their sign on the window says $10 bottles of wine. But underneath that, there is small print reading 'Bottles of wine at cost + $10' I think I prefer this to a $10 bottle of wine, because I'm sure the quality of said wine would not be very good. We settled on the Strewn Reisling-Gewurtstraminer, which is a local favourite of mine from Niagara on the Lake and I was pleased to see it at $22/bottle on the list.

The decor is very nice and modern and the size of the restaurant is quaint, allowing for very attentive service.

We were greeted with a complimentary appetizer of some sort of a spinach and potato croquette. It's always nice to get an amuse bouche and this was as tasty as they come.

The Chaat was okay, but it had pomegranate seeds on it and our friend is allergic. More for us. The samosa had been thoughtfully cut into three by the kitchen so that we could all share. The Chicken Tikka, cubes of marinated chicken breast were very tender and flavourful, but not as crunchy on the outside as I normally like.

What I found lacking in all of the curries was a distinctiveness in flavour. They were all pureed without any of the lovely brown bits of smoky onion and bright ginger. There was a homogenous quality to all of them that left me a little cold. Saag Paneer was bland, Beef Vindaloo didn't have any of the vinegared heat which is typical of the dish, Lamb was not exceedingly tender and was missing any trace of a yogurt tang. The Chicken was probably my favourite as it had a wonderfully refreshing coconut aroma that helped it to stand out from the other dishes. But the last time I had Chicken Chettinandu, it was very spicy with chili, clove, corriander seed and much more aromatic than creamy. Regardless, it was the stand out entree.
I had Rasamalai for dessert and it was very small (just a little half ramekin) but delicious and I was pretty stuffed and couldn't have eaten much more.

I felt that the curries here were very dumbed-down for the North American palate. Perhaps this has something to do with their very white, uptown location on Mt. Pleasant, but I've definitely had much better Indian food.

Most of the stars go to the excellent staff who were patient, informative, kind and provided us with a wonderful dining experience.

Would I go back again? Yes. The wine is a great deal and I'd like to see if they can make a good go of some of the other items on the menu. With all these five star reviews, maybe we were there on an off night. My friend also still has the Groupon she purchased, so maybe I will be her dining partner for the next time."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and menu. Quaint, accommodating and just the right amount of variety means this is my new favourite Indian in the area. Tried the chicken chettinad - 
subtle ginger coriander blend with a smooth gravy. Delicious garlic naan. Stand out was the eggplant bharta. Smoky and delightful. What a perfect neighbourhood restaurant 
."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid Indian restaurant with a modern interior and vibe, marigold is the place to go! I went with my friend last night and both of our dishes were amazing. The staff was attentive and friendly and came to check on me several times while I was waiting for my friend to arrive. 

I ordered the vegetable biryani and it was great! I wish it had a bit more kick, but it was filled with veggies and tofu which I appreciated. The waiter told us that that particular dish took a longer time to make and gave us a snack on the house while we waited. When the meal finally came i was so surprised!! Not only was the presentation very interesting, they give you quite a large portion! 

My friend ordered the lamb from the appetizer menu and she was able have that as her entree and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not small per say, but if you have a large appetite I wouldn't rely on it as your main. 

I also got the butter/garlic naan which was incredible. I'll definitely be back again next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Different flavours!

Ambience and location are amazing. Service was well. Small place. Small Staff.

Now to the important part. The food. After a week off travelling; I was craving some Indian food- mostly Biryani. I work in Markham- so I find a lot of biryani there but they tend to be Sri lankan style and I wanted more of an Indian flavour. I saw the pictures and reviews and was sold.

It was definitely a unique experience taste-wise. The food is not overwhelmingly spicy but there seems to be some fusion integrated into it in order to get a more indian flavor. The presentation of the Biryani was amazing- the taste was great as well.

The beef vindaloo was not thick and oily. It was more so a paste like gravy. Heavily induced in turmeric so that you can taste the sourness after. 

Overall- I can see the popularity of this place as the flavours are a bit toned down with the spiciness.However I LIKE SPICY. So for the price. $19 for biryani. $14 for Beef vindaloo,. I could have got a lot more flavour elsewhere.

It was worth the try- good setting and service. Flavour was new to the palette. However it did not match mine when it comes to Indian food. I think they are trying to cater to those who are not used to overwhelming spiciness that comes hand in hand with Indian dishes.

So they have a niche market."}
{"text":"Crabcake is awesome, one of the best i jave ever had. The indian spice make it very delicious. Chicken tikka was very juicy and good falveroud. I didnot like the samuse since it has raisins in it. Totally, i liked the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Loved the interior decor when I walked into this small restaurant. It was modern yet still cultural - a perfect mix. It was empty 7pm on a Tuesday night. 

Appetizer: 
Road Side Chaat was so incredibly well-presented. It looked appetizing and it tasted even better than it looked. This is a big portion for an appetizer so I'd recommend you eat it as a shareable. 

Entree: 
Wild Mushroom Something Something Curry. Unfortunately I can't remember the name but even worse - the website doesn't have the same menu we were looking at last night so thumbs down for not keeping it updated. I asked that this curry be spicy and it gave me the right amount of spice - they didn't over due it. The mushrooms were bigger sliced pieces than I imagined. This was tasty! 

Have this with the Garlic Naan (the server told us to get the Garlic Naan since it was Buttered and Garlic as opposed to the Butter Naan which no Garlic)."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout with UberEats and thought it was excellent and the food arrived hot. 

We ordered beef madras, palaak paneer and butter chicken with rice, naan and the daily appetizer. All dishes were very delicious. I found the portion sizes very fair and we had lots of leftovers. One of the better takeout places I've had. 

Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"We went to Marigold Bistro for the first time last weekend and we really enjoyed it. The restaurant is quite small, which I like, and the decor was modern. It was a Friday night so it did get busy and I would recommend making a reservation if you're going on a weekend night. We ordered one of the specials, beef tenderloin with a yummy green sauce (not sure what it was exactly... looked like of like a mint pesto yoghurt or something) and the butter chicken with garlic naan and saffron rice. All very delicious!! The butter chicken especially, really good flavours, and the naan was baked perfectly, and the saffron in the rice was special. The service was attentive but still gave us enough space to enjoy our conversation. Who we think is the owner came over and checked on us which was unexpected but very nice, and I think that is always a good sign of someone who cares about their customers and the quality of the experience. I believe he made a point of going to all of the patrons at some point during their meal or afterwards. We will certainly be going back when we next are in the mood for Indian food! The menu isn't overly large but I think that quality over quantity is probably a good tactic and they seem to have specials to change things up for the regulars."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service. The staff are rude and unwilling to accommodate. We found hair in our food and this was dealt with in an extremely unprofessional manner. The staff accused of it being our own hair...

The food is subpar as well. I will not be returning to this horrendous place. I can't believe they are part of the winterlicious line up...save your money and go somewhere else! See other reviews about hair and insects in the food, it seems this is a recurring problem with this place. Disgusting."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in the area, from service quality to food freshness and yummyness (only way to describe it), everything was great. Price was spot on, wine deal can't be beat. Definitely worth a try if you remotely enjoy Indian food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better restaurants I've tried on Mount Pleasant Road.

We had the Chicken Chettinad, Palak Paneer, rice, and some naan. 
Although I wish things were spicier (the chicken dish did specify \"spicy curry\"), with some additional hot sauce the 2 of us left stuffed and satisfied with our meal.

They have their own house beers on tap, an Amber and an IPA. I had the IPA and thought it was pretty good and I applaud them for taking that extra effort into customizing both their food and drinks."}
{"text":"Marigold: Delivery for two people worked out as $48, just mains, poppadoms and naan. A tiny bit pricey I thought...until it arrived and i realized that that one main+rice would EASILY fill two people. In fact, I ate half of mine and I feel physically ill. So much food. At least it means a good hearty lunch tomorrow! 

The butter chicken dish was v heavy on the tomatoes and a little sweet for my taste, but the lamb rogan josh was near perfect. Some fresh tomatoes in there would have made it even better, over purely sauce but it tasted fantastic and the meat was juicy and tender. The garlic naan was thin and light too. It's the first Indian I've tried in midtown and I was pleasantly surprised as I'd heard good Indian is hard to find anywhere south of the suburbs. It wasn't quite perfect but I'm full and I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a groupon as a party of four.  Making reservations was easy and the place had nice decor.  Unfortunately that's where the positive ends.  Our appetizers were brought out one by one with a 12 minute wait in between.  The place was busy when we got there but not at capacity as most people were finishing when we got there.  I would expect both apps to come out together.  When the mains came out a hair was noticed in one dish (saag).  This was a short hair from a male and I was the first person to touch the dish, so this was definitely not a hair from our party.  After inspecting the other dishes a hair was also found in the chana masala.  Both were hair from a male as they were short.  Brought both hairs to the attention of the employee, he apologized and offered to have the dishes remade.  We had already waited over an hour to get the mains, so this was disturbing.  We should have walked out at that point but decided to finish the dinner.  The new dishes were brought out pretty quickly, and there was only one apology at the beginning.  After finishing the employee never returned to offer desert or see if we needed anything.  Eventually asked for the bill and the employee presented us with a bill in full. He never offered to remove anything from the bill for the negative experience.  Asked him what he could do as the service was unsatisfactory and he said he would see.  He sent another employee who claimed to be the shift manager and he said he would not do anything.  He said accidents happen and he was sorry but he could not offer anything.  We were considering this place for a group event and told him his unwillingness to fix the situation resulted in poor reviews and a loss of business.  He said we could leave without paying and he would pay out of his pocket but he could not offer anything.  Common sense when running a business and you mess up, do whatever it takes to get the customers back.  Having customers create a scene in front of other guests should be an embarrassment to this place.  The point of groupon is to acquire new customers, but when you do nothing to ensure customers come back what's the point."}
{"text":"really delicious indian food, not greasy and original.. well.. the service is a bit on the lousy side but for me the food more than makes up for it"}
{"text":"First visit to marigold left me quite satisfied..nice atmosphere, good service and great meal. Look forward to returning to try some different dishes."}
{"text":"Your review

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and naan bread for delivery. The chicken was in huge chunks, but came apart like stringy pulled chicken. The sauce so thick, and muddled with strings of chicken, that it was more the texture of a hummus or a thick spread. Flavour was good, but the sauce needed to be velvety-smooth and creamy! Also, could have used some fresh cilantro. The chicken was stringy, not juicy, and the peppers were enormous and raw. A big portion for $12.95 though. Also disappointed they didnt include any pappadaums, or any cutlery or napkins. The big plus was that it came in 30 minutes, much sooner than the advertised 45-60 minutes, but i wouldn't order here again. A good sauce is just too important.  The search for good Indian delivery continues..."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night with friends (another couple).
FYI --- the dishes are good sized (but the dish size is deceptive) so keep in mind.

They started us out with complimentary papadums with some dipping sauce (although not the usual tamarind sauce).  
We shared 2 apps for the table.
Then we ordered the Lamb Josh and 2 Butter Chicken and a Bread Basket (with 3 kinds of Naan).

Food was great and not too spicy although the potato patties in the apps were a bit.
You can get the usual mango lassi drinks and raita to cool the heat off!

Good quality food -- butter chicken was a little more tomato-y than I am used to but good.

Suggest you reserve as there is not a lot of tables, and during the winter time, might want to ask for one not close to the door!  Parking is pretty plentiful at night on the street.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were feeling lazy and I'd had a taste for Indian food for a while, so we decided to order in using one of the many food-delivery apps. Marigold seemed to have a strong assortment of dishes, so it didn't take long for us to settle on this joint.

For my meal, I decided to go with the Beef Vindaloo (\"A fiery hot goan curry with chilli, vinegar and potatoes\"). At first, I was super impressed with the spice level of the dish. I mean, this thing is not kidding around. Was it too spicy? Probably, but that wasn't my biggest issue.

When they list vinegar in the list of ingredients, they're not talking about a touch of vinegar. They *drowned* this thing in vinegar. The first few bites weren't too bad - I was more distracted by the immense heat - but as I ate more and more, the sourness of the vinegar become increasingly prevalent. There basically reached a point at which the dish became inedible, and I found myself mixing it with my dining companion's food.

Speaking of, the other item we ordered was the Saag Chicken (\"Chicken cooked with rich spinach curry\"). This was a vast improvement (ie it was edible). It was a fairly decent spin on Saag Paneer, and although it was a little on the bland side, we gobbled it up out of necessity.

I doubt I'd ever order from Marigold again."}
{"text":"PSA: If you do not want to deliver to certain areas, do not take delivery orders in the first place only to take out your frustrations on unsuspecting customers! This creature processed my delivery order and 1 hour later, wanted me to come and meet him to get it. Imagine that. When I reminded him that I paid for delivery, first words out of his mouth when he came to my door were that he won't deliver again because I didn't want to come out and meet him etc etc and then added \"I am the owner\" before storming off, LOL. Well, hello to you too, Mr Rude-Arrogant. To make matters worse, the food was mediocre at best and very cold! He should have just kept the food and given me a refund. No, little man, there won't be another order from me. Thank you."}
{"text":"I was excited to find Marigold and after ordering from this place a few times, we wanted to love this place given its location to home but we found the butter chicken too sweet and the korma and some other curries too bland.  Anything in the Chettinad curry is definitely worth ordering.  Lamb parties (stuffed) and chicken tikka masala were good too."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this restaurant but I have to say I was beyond let down.

We drove all the way from downtown to pick up food since they don't deliver and we called ahead and placed the order to avoid waiting.

When we called, we gave specific instructions on how we wanted a specific dish to be prepared and the person that answered agreed.

Upon arrival, I asked again if the dish had been prepared as requested and he reassured us that it had.

We drive all the way back downtown only to find that this was not the case at all! The completely forgot to add the key ingredient which completes the dish!

I called the restaurant back and gave them a piece of my mind to which he responded that he would send another dish all the way downtown..I'm not heartless enough to have them drive down when they clearly don't go that far.

The conversation ended there with an apology.

Somebody then called me back within 5 minutes saying that they would give us a \"free\" appetizer next time we chose to come.

How they're going to remember that and whether we're ever going back, I don't know.

Thanks but no thanks!!!"}
{"text":"The Chapli Kebab was amazing. Freshly cooked and stuffed warm goat cheese, the minced meat texture was smooth and satisfying. This was the highlight of the meal.

The rice comes in very large portions. We ordered two mains, the platter of bread/na'an, a rice and the kebabs and this was far too much for two people (noted for next time!). I would still go for the kebabs next time, so in my opinion I'd do rice and 1 main + kebabs.

I had the Khurchan Chicken Curry. It was very good, but the medium was much spicier than I'm used to (though this was expected). I wish there was a spiciness level between medium (which is actually hot) and mild (which is not).

Service was great. The staff are very patient and willing to explain to you anything you want and also offer recommendations.

{"text":"Delicate, fresh, delicious Indian food. A real treat and great service too.  We had the patak paneer and aloo gobi which are typically afterthoughts, but this place made them spectacular.  The saffron rice was beautifully served and cooked.  Our waiter was attentive and soft spoken; perfect after a busy day."}
{"text":"Oh my. Where does one start. SERVICE. S-E-R-V-I-C-E. Repeat after me, please: SERVICE.

The people who work at Marigold have not had a day's worth of training in good customer service it seems. It is very unfortunate, as I do know for a fact that their food is delicious. We had eaten there once prior and loved the food. Why a 1 then, you wonder?

A Tuesday night. 7pm. Reservation. We are in at 7:02pm. Get our orders in by 7:10 and get a bottle of wine while we wait. 10 minutes pass. 20 minutes pass. 30 minutes pass. No starters yet. It is 7:45 now and we have not seen a single piece of food. We ask the waiter what is going on and he apologises - some problem in the kitchen, brings us complimentary snack. Ok. Starters show up at 7:55. 5-6 people come and get pickup. UberEats drivers show up 3 times. It is 8:30 and we have not received our food. 
We call the waiter again - sorry, problems with the order system something-something. We thank them for the starters but request our receipt, pay and leave without eating.

Mind you, had they acknowledged the fact they were delayed, had someone come over and apologised 15 minutes in and not waited for 40 minutes until we complained, it'd be a different story. It is all about COMMUNICATION. And there was none. We sat there as at least 9 people got their food before we did, and they either ordered that food online or via delivery. And sure, if you want to cater to both in-house clientele and outside clientele (pickup / delivery), by all means do so. BUT, have the capacity to do it. Have enough staff in the kitchen so that everyone gets their food on time. And, of course, train your staff how to deal with these situations. 

Absolutely disappointed and will, sadly, not be going back. After over an hour and a half of waiting, I think that's the nicest I can do."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today and we were pleasantly surprised.  First the place is not called Bombay something where the cook does not know North Indian cooking. The chef is from New Delhi. So it's real indian food. We tried Khurchan chicken curry which is like similar to karahi chicken and onion kulcha. It was fresh chicken ... not dry or smelly kind. The roadside chaat app was not really chaat but bhelpuri. A little on the sweet side but we still liked it. We have eaten at a bunch of places, even Brampton,  but this is true north indian cosmopolitan food.. A++. Didn't have a gastric burn or need soda afterwards for digestion."}
{"text":"Take out order. 

Not the best. The order took 90 minutes to arrive, I was told because of rain and traffic. This was slightly difficult to let slide as I live 600m away (yes, maybe I should have just picked it up myself, but rain...)

I ordered khurchan chicken curry and vegetable korma, naan and rice. The chicken tasty but wasn't made up of very good cuts (ie. some inedible pieces). The vegetable korma wasn't very flavourful and was really green bean intensive. The beans were chewy and it just wasn't really pleasant to eat. I've had much better naan - it's quite thin. 

I was craving indian food, and this didn't satisfy that craving at all. I won't order here again."}
{"text":"Thought the tikka masala was one of the better ones I've had in the city, save for the fact the chicken pieces were so huge that they must have been for a dinosaur.  The kuchuran curry was also solid, nice oniony flavour though it could have been a spicier.  The curry veggies in spicy tomato sauce was a let down, however - too much coconut milk, not enough tomato, and the ration of scallions to other veg was maybe 6:1.  But awful naan.  Another meh Indian resto."}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken, saffron rice, garlic naan, samosa duo. Ordered 2 samosa duo's that are 1 chicken and 1 beef and we got 3 beef and 1 chicken that were basically a disgusting paste. The garlic naan was borderline soggy and the rice was basically white rice with some sauce poured on top. Butter chicken was ok but that's hard to get wrong.  Used to rave about this place but something happened either new management or they stopped caring about quality, will never order from this place again. Save your money and order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night with a Groupon. We ordered garlic naan, rice, beef vindaloo and aloo ghobi.  Everything was fresh and flavourful.  Their wine list is very reasonably priced. Nice ambiance and good service too.  I recommend."}
