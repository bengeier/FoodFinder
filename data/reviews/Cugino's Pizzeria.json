{"text":"There was something weird about this place. My cousins and I came here cause we hella wanted pizza. We where looking at the menu for a long time cause it was our first time and the cashier wasn't very helpful. They didn't have thick crust because they where out of it. And the whole time the cashiers where just so annoyed! It didn't bother me until the girl brought me my garlic roll things and I said thank you and the girl didn't even smile or say you're welcome . There's just something unprofessional about this place. Ya feel me? 

The pizza was okay. The ranch was okay. We're very picky about our ranch. The garlic things where okay. Maybe We'll come back. Probably not."}
{"text":"Tried it for lunch.  We both got the special, 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and a drink for $5.99.  The pizza was good but it was literally the greasiest pizza we have ever eaten!  It was just dripping off the pizza.  My hubby used 6 napkins just to try to soak up his grease and it wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.  Loved it.  Locally owned and operated.  Rick the owner is great and makes a great pizza!"}
{"text":"An east-coast pizza joint is finally up here in Utah!  Hooray!

While not the best pizza I've ever had, it is certainly a much better option than the chain restaurants that flood this area of town.  It's a thinner crust pizza, slightly greasy (think NY style), and topped with fresh ingredients. 

My problem is that I had two completely different experiences here ordering the same exact thing.  Both times we ordered the Tomato Basil pizza.  The first time the crust was cooked perfectly- not soggy and not burnt- and they were generous with the toppings.  This included tons of garlic which I was very happy about.  

The next week, we ordered the same thing since our previous experience was so good.  But this time they were stingy with ingredients (no garlic boo) and the crust was soggy in the middle.  If this would have been my first go at the place, I wouldn't have been impressed and I probably would have never bothered going back.  Luckily for them I know Cugino's has potential.

I've also ordered a slice of Sicilian style (thicker, doughier crust- good) and the garlic knots (fluffy dough with lots of garlic- yum).

I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and rate them four stars based off our first experience and hoping that our second time was a fluke.  

Oh, and a suggestion: please put the basil on the pizza after it comes out of the oven so that it keeps its flavor.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but I don't know how you expect to survive in this market when your delivery schedule is not reliable.
I tried Cuginos Pizza last week and liked it a lot.  I called today at 2:30P and was told that they will not be delivering until 4P. Decided to order Rosatti's 294-1212... The pizza is just as good (if not better) and the delivery is always on time and consistent. 
Would like to give this place 4/5stars however they need to get their act together and shell out for a daytime delivery driver.  Not a good idea to get between a fat man and his pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Just like I would get when I lived back east. I eat here a couple of times per month now. They just added pasta to their menu. I tried it this week and it is just as good as the pizza."}
{"text":"Cons: as soon as I made my order the guy making the pizza asked why I want certain toppings and then when I picked up the pizza everything I asked for was on the side- not on the pizza. The pizza I took home was not good and it's pricey.

Overall- I would not come back."}
{"text":"Best pizza!!! Just like NY pizza. Best pizza in town. I ordered  2 reg slices and went back for a third. This pizza joint beats out the competition. I hope they deliver to my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza oven you could use in Vegas for a pizza! Pizza is excellent! The owners are great guys, the Italian sub is also my favorite! Cant say no to anything, small menu but they cook it perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday. I ordered the 2 slices of cheese special and he got the pepperoni. While the pizza was extremely greasy like other people mentioned, it was delicious. Big, floppy fold-in-half slices like you would get in NY. We also had a cannoli which was really good as well. I thought it was much better than any chain restaurant around here, and I liked the feel of the restaurant. Customer service was spot-on. We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I've had better pizza elsewhere. The artisanal ones with thin crust and organic toppings. The Cuginos is not it. But kids love it.  And staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, right at opening, place was empty and nice. I assume the person working was either the manager or the owner. After placing my order I was told he would give me the slice for free. I tried to insist on paying and was rudely told that because of bank fees I would be getting the slice free anyway. Which didn't make sense, because I would have paid for the slice, I don't control his debit/credit transactions fees. I don't normally carry cash and I didn't appreciate the worker basically telling me I was stealing from his business. The pizza was good, but will be taking my business other places. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I'm rarely on this side of town, but a root canal brought me over. I needed a bite before my appointment and Cugino's came up when I did a search. I ordered the two pepperoni slices + drink lunch special for $5.99. The slices were up in a hurry. They were heated until crisp which I always appreciate. I expect pizza, especially with pepperoni to be greasy, but this was dripping grease. I sopped up as much as good with napkins but it was still really greasy! Good, but GREASY.

I found it odd that I was dining at 12:30 and I was the only customer until I was nearly done with my slices. Then, it was only a couple that came in. I expected a strong lunch crowd. It worked out for me, I was in and out in no time."}
{"text":"Great, great food!  The service, however, needs improvement.  But- lucky for them the pizza and strmboli is so good that it is worth overlooking the poor service."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that I have never really liked pizza but occasionally I agree to order some since my husband likes it.  So I called them for the first time and ordered 2 garden salads and the Cugino special with added basil.  I LOVED this pizza.  It tasted like all fresh ingredients. Like another reviewer, I thought it was a little pricey. Until I tasted it. Then I realized that there was something wrong with all of the other pizzas I have tried. I am guessing inferior ingredients.  SO you get what you pay for. It was also more filling than other pizzas I have tried, so we had some left over and are eating it for breakfast this morning. DELICIOUS!
 Also, I ordered small garden salads and when I have ordered from other places they WERE small.  One of those little Styrofoam boxes.  But at Cugino's, they put it in the large Styrofoam container and it was filled up.  And they gave me TWO containers of salad dressing. 
If they keep doing it the way they are doing it, I will never go anywhere else for pizza.
And FYI, I am not an employee or an owner, but a real customer. lol"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza by the slice or whole pie - very good all around place. I usually just get a slice of cheese, but yesterday, we got a whole pizza, and it was even good this morning. If you're there, try the Italian ices that they have. Really decent tiramisu as well. Especially for a fast-food place."}
{"text":"This is brilliance! Here is how it works... It is a small little shop in a strip mall. The owner is a huge New York fan, but don't hold that against him! You have to order the lunch specials, because it is a great deal. He makes the pizzas plain cheese and you pay for any topping you want added to it. The flavor of the pizza is great and price is just as good. I have to recommend this place to anyone in the area during lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service, great food, great prices; and the cannoli's... Well, you'll  just have to try the cannoli's for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food itself is fine, decent prices.  But I had ordered online and requested a cheese pizza with a ham topping for my son. I received the delivery, signed for everything then took our pizzas inside.  When we sat down for dinner and opened the box we realized they had made a mistake and put pepperoni on it instead (which my kiddo won't eat because it's too spicy for him).  I double checked my online receipt and it clearly stated ham so I called the store.  When speaking with the manager I was asked if I was sure I ordered correctly...yes I am sure otherwise I would have dealt with my mistake and not called.  I was then told \"well I guess we will have to send you a new one\"...


Thankfully the new pizza arrived quickly!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there two days in a row authentic New York style
If it's the crust that makes the pizza for then this is your place
If it's the sauce that makes the pizza for you then this is your place"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and the first thing I have to say is WOW! When I walked in it was so clean and smelled so good! It's open you can see the fire in the stove and the works were smiling. They actually have Italian ice that's not pre made. They were petty quick with my order and brung it to me! I enjoy that. A company that is attentive to you. Your not just a number or a name they come to you with your order. I will be going back they have an interesting menu and their are some things I would like to try."}
{"text":"They are stealing money from customers.  I called them many times often weekly, when family and friends would arrive to a visit 2 to 3 pizza's and a couple different salads were ordered.  Many times I couldn't figure out the bill, I tried to figure out how they would come up with the amount I was being charged.  Finally last Friday night I called in an order and we picked it up. Later that evening my husband said isn't $25 a bit hight for a medium pizza and small anipasta salad?  I checked the menu pricing and again it didn't add up.  It was late so the next day I went in and spoke with the owner, he basically called me a liar and said there was nothing he could do about it.  I said you're willing to lose a customer over this and he said yes.  Check your receipts there is a reason he has an old fashioned cash register and refuses to upgrade.  that way he can steal from you and hope you won't notice.  THIEVES, THIEVES, THIEVES!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I can't comment on the pizza since we did not have it but we are coming back tomorrow as it was that good! I had the broccoli rabe, chicken and provolone sandwich. One of the best sandwiches ever for me. We also tried the homemade Italian sausage. Excellent. 
My husband had the veal parm. So good and large that we had to take half of it home. They make their own mozzarella cheese and sauce( gravy) as well. Great experience and run by a nice family. Can't wait to return tomorrow. Need to study the menu to make my plan. I'm trying to save room for one of their homemade Italian desserts! A must try.

Okay we went back the next day. Had a couple of slices of cheese pizza. Nice thin crust. Very good. We also had an Italian sub. Lots of meat and cheese on very good bread. . Had a side of meatballs- yum!We will miss you Cuginos. Until next time ."}
{"text":"Maybe Three and a half, I only got a classic slice so I can't really tell if it's as good as the original Cuginos. But cash only under $5 and the older guy at the register was kind of a d*ck. But food was good, gf got a great calzone, a few visits (a sicilian slice and a sandwhich) will determine if it's as good as the other. But that dude is enough to make me not want to return. Always worth a try if you live in the area though."}
{"text":"We have been to their other location and had a good experience, so we were glad to find out there was a location near us.  

We ordered a medium half White Special and half Cugino's Special, paid and sat down.  Then another worker comes out to tell us they can't make a half white and half red sauce pizza.  When I asked why... she shrugged her shoulders and pointed to the man at the pizza oven.  So I went over for an explanation and he said because the sauce would run unto the white side.  I assured him it was fine as neither of us were allergic to sauce we just wanted to try two different styles on one pie. OMG how difficult are we huh.   He made a gesture like okay have your way and continued.  

We received our pie and the White Special was good with just the right garlic seasoning and chunks of ricotta, while the Cugino's Special which consisted of pre-cooked green bell peppers and pepperoni was not that great but the crust itself was delicious.  We also shared an Antipasto Salad with their house vinaigrette which was delicious and big enough for two. 

Overall I've experienced better pizza and service.    Although they closed at 9pm and it was only 8pm the staff was more preoccupied with getting the place closed down than anything else."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good. Thin or Sicilian it's good. Specials don't run from certain times during lunch it's actually all day which I like. Sicilian pizza is thick and the size of the slices are big enough to not leave you hungry at all. One thing I wasn't that crazy about it the garlic knots. The knots were kind of tough and appeared to have a lot of seasoning on them yet I really didn't taste any garlic at all. The meat sauce that came with the knots though tasted very good. I have stopped by on my lunch break and seen different types of pizza out so even though they have a daily special board it doesn't mean you can actually get any of that. If it's the younger guy he will only sell you what's out but if it's the older guy he will make any pizza or sandwich you want if you are willing to wait for it."}
{"text":"Just got done ordering a large pepperoni and the tomato basil. Absolutely loved them both. This is my new pizza place. Great taste. Fast delivery. Good price. I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and probably our last. We went in for lunch and there's no one in there. I stood at the counter reading the menu for almost 5 minutes and when I realized they must of not heard the door I called out and nothing. I peaked my head around the corner and the gentleman was sitting on the counter watching a movie or something on his phone. He came out and made our pizza the cheese  pizza sitting on the counter looked like it was sitting for a while. He put some pepperoni on it and reheated it. It was definitely not the greatest pizza I've had. I'm not a grease dabber but it was more grease than pizza!  So I blotted it and ate it anyway. The Caesar salad was also nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! We have a new neighborhood pizza parlor! My wife and I stopped in for lunch. Ordered a chef salad to share and a med pizza to have a slice and take the rest home. We finished the pizza at the restaurant!!!!!!  I love restaurants with open kitchens so you can watch your food being prepared and the ingredients used."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Great staff. Ranch is the best in town. Always a go to when I'm craving pizza. I love that there's always the perfect amount of sauce and cheese, not too much not too little. Overall awesome!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today for the first time.  I did the 2 Sicilian slices and a drink.  My fiance did the regular 2 slices and drink.  We both had pepperoni.  The Pizza was good.  We each swapped a slice so we could try both styles.  We both decided we like the Sicilian (deep dish) style better. Overall though it was good and we will be going back."}
{"text":"Wow.  I ask for a mushroom slice of pizza. The dude throws cold, raw mushrooms on a slice and puts it right at the front of the oven. No extra cheese or sauce to, you know, cook the mushrooms. Nope! Just slight heat. Amazing. But the pizza didn't taste bad, so there's that."}
{"text":"One slice of greasy goodness. Thank you.!!!
 I will recommend to my peoples."}
{"text":"This is an authentic NY style pizza place.  The Pizza is delicious and the customer service is great.  The very tall young man is very helpful and   Sweet.  The garlic knots are addicting and their RANCH is homemade and super yummy!!!!  It's a very cozy, cute place close to home.  It's a must weekly visit!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots were the only good thing there. The pizza was bland, the salads were even  horrible. the staff was rude. And they are way way over prices. It was not a good experience at all. Never again"}
{"text":"Been back many times since and must add that the Eggplant Parm is clearly the best in town. The breaded cutlets are sliced thin and are just true perfection. Also the salad that comes with the meal has some muscle and includes big tomatoes, olives and pepperchini's too with homemade dressing. Rice Balls are also great too."}
{"text":"I Love Cuginos, especially the Maryland Pkwy location, but this Decatur location has always done a great job.  I called a few moments ago to order a large pie and to throw in a few slices of Sicilian.  The girl on the phone said they were out of Sicilian pizza.  How in God's green Earth does a pizza place \"run out\" of any kind of pizza?  That is a bad job of resource management and disappoints me greatly."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in Las Vegas. Thin crust topped with excellent cheese and sauce. Service is great and the luncheon special cannot be beat. Two slices of pizza and a soft drink for $4.99."}
{"text":"Love the Maryland location and I love this location. Although there doesn't seem much to making a great thin-sliced east-coast style pizza it sure is tough to find. These guys (Rick and Frank) get it right every time. Thanks fellas see you soon!"}
{"text":"Our go-to pizza place. My husband and I are from New York City and it reminds us being home. The cheese and crust is so tasty. I love this pizza. It's a true New York slice."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Pizza. They've been in business for over 20 years and we were thrilled they moved into our neighborhood. Simple family dinning atmosphere with several tv's to be entertained while you dine. They recently expanded into pasta dishes to compliment there vast pizza menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here and didn't realize they opened at 11. The guy/maybe owner opened the door at 1040 for us and said it was no problem, and he let us in. The pizza was really good and it was fresh! We love finding new pizza places."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, my experience at this fast food pizza place was horrible to say the least, the man who was making pizza's behind the counter was very angry for no apparent reason and was also very snappy with me with I was ordering my food, (my guess the owner) I ordered two slices of pepperoni and garlic knots, the garlic knots were pleasant (I'm a garlic type person it isn't that hard to please me in that category) back on topic. I watched this man cut two slices of the pie that was sitting in the window, throw some pepperoni's on it and slide it in the brick oven. Just disgusting overly greasy pizza when it didn't have to be. As a person who eats pizza often I know pizza for one isn't healthy and is gonna be greasy from time to time but these slices were grease sponges to say the least. 
Very very bad experience, I hope the owner doesn't call this place a pizzeria."}
{"text":"Yey this pizza is quite good! The fact that its premade and is ready to be heated sent me some red flags but they have a recipe for greatness because this pizza gets a total of five stars from me. I love great food that's hot and not overly priced. I also like a kitchen where you can see the food being cooked. Its a nice little cuddle spot to grab hot food and its yummy!  Yes when I wrote cuddle spot I meant its date friendly or family friendly and yes I did provide pictures."}
{"text":"Didn't realize you had to order up at the counter for a few minutes. Sat at the table waiting for someone to come over but the employee just kept looking at us and doing their own thing. We were the only customers for about half our dining experience. Food came out quick, about 15-20 minutes total. The food was pretty good but I have had better. Prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Just like new york. I love the pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. I always get the 2 slices w/ a drink. But pass on the garlic knots, they're dry."}
{"text":"I got a salad,  cheese pizza, cheesy garlic bread and the potato gnocchi in my order. My kids loved the pizza. I thought the potato gnocchi were fantastic. I will definitely recommend that dish to others. I'll order from Cugino's again and again."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by since this was one of the closest \"non-chain\" pizza places in our area. I was skeptical based on the bad reviews but I'm so glad we tried it. We asked for the crust to be extra crispy but not burned. It was amazing! The only down side was the pepperoni were pretty gross, but taking them off did the trick. $12 for a medium one topping, so great price for the taste. We loved it so much we went back less than a week later for a large cheese & still amazing. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and have not lost their consistency since there move. Love to go here and eat with the family. Great New York style pizza. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok so the pizza didn't taste bad. Wasn't great either. Why 2 stars? The pizza jacked up my stomach, not cool. Also, BEWARE if you haven't been here before, like me when I ordered. The menu online has wrong pricing. Ordered a meat lovers medium. Online it said $11.99. Get there and it's $13.99. Really? Yeah, it's only $2 but that's not cool. If you change the price. Update your online menu. Most people who order to go, look online for price. Not cool."}
{"text":"Best NY Pizza in town. We have been eating it since 1995 when I first moved to Vegas . The location has changed and is closer to me now. I love a large Cheese Pizza and a Cheeze Calzone .. Family owned and operated  and friendly service."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Real New York Style and flavor!!! Food was fantastic and prices were just right!! I'll be back again and again!! Thank you Cuginos!!"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and this is the closest To NY pizza that I have found out here. It's delicious. Only complaint is I wish they had a bigger menu. My whole family loves this place and we definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Best place for a quick lunch and cheesy,greasy true NY style pizza. Rick,the owner, is always genuine and friendly. Their lunch specials are decent priced.I order two slices of one topping with a drink for 6.99. Their crust is thin and not too sugary, not too much sauce, the cheese is rich, and its greasy. Honestly people, I don't understand why you complain about greasy pizza ESPECIALLY NY style pizza.  I will always choose their pizza over any pizza place in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the Cugino's on Maryland parkway so when I heard there's one at North Decatur and 215 I was excited. THE NAME IS IN THE TITLE \"Pizzeria\"
  First this is not a deli like the Maryland one, don't come here to buy your sauces, noodles, and fresh meats. No Donnie special here :(
We ordered a meat lovers and a meatball parm. Both delicious. This Cugino's only deals with the pizzas, calzones, and a few sandwiches. No appetizers, pasta dishes or full dinner /lunch meals (no lasagna, ziti etc).
Food= delish
Service=above and beyond
Prices=great
Selection=I wanted the Donnie Special Sandwich but hey what can you do. 
I will come here again an again.. I think I bleed marinara"}
{"text":"I don't know if there's pizza in Heaven. But if there is, they make it here. This is the tastiest pizza in Vegas. 
And their cheesy garlic bread? Amazing! 
And their spaghetti? Stupefacente!
Their prices are super reasonable.
There's ample seating.
And the ambience is chill.
Also, the staff here is always friendly every time I go here.
Check it out. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Pizza specials are fantastic! We will often order a whole pizza with meatballs (the flat kind) and pineapple. Good amount of toppings and pizza is delicious. My husband has also had a Stromboli which he really enjoyed and will order again. We have dined in and ordered to go and have always been happy with the quality and taste. It seems pretty steady when we've eaten inside the restaurant as people come in to order and eat in or take food to go.

My husband is from New York and he likes the pizza here so that is true testament to the pizza!"}
{"text":"Notice everyone talks about there pizza and not the sandwiches that's because they suck. Chicken parm is the precooked chicken breast you buy at Walmart thrown in a crockpot of sauce. Just not good. Will eat the pizza it's ok but nothing to drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. They only had some regular slices available on this last visit. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, since i was hoping for some of their delicious Sicilian, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. On previous visits I've also had their \"Meatball Parm\" and really enjoyed it as well. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try."}
{"text":"The best pizza place in northern Las Vegas. I go here for lunch and it's so good. I get the lunch special for $5. You get two cheese slices and a drink. How great is that?! Also it's a plus they sell Coke!! The setting of the place is clean, roomy, and comfortable. The owner is dope. Come eat here now!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before Haleamano's Hawaii Send-Off Performance...
Pretty good pizza, they have other Italian specialities, and also Italian Ices.
Cugino's is definitely better pizza-wise than Chicago Brewing Company...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(298/365) \"Cugino's 2.0\"

Don't know if this is the same peeps as the location on Maryland but we decided to check it out. We got a medium pizza, but I wanted a White Pizza, and Wifey wanted a combination style pizza, so  we ordered half white, and half Cugino's Special, their version of a combination. To start, we also shared an Antipasto Salad which was decent.

Upon delivering our salad, our waitress returns to tell us that the pizza maker cannot make the pizza. We already knew that the red and white sauces may mix and run into each other (it really didn't though), and we didn't mind, so our waitress relayed that message to the pizza maker , and sure enough, the pizza came out how we wanted.

I liked the white Pizza half, but the combination side was not my favorite due to the onions and peppers being pre-cooked and put on after the pizza came out.. not bad for our first visit, and it's conveniently in our neck of the woods.  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I was kinda disappointed. Was our first time eating here. Although we tried to eat here a week or so ago, but they apparently closed early and weren't taking any more orders at 7:30pm. 

We ordered a pizza, salad, and a sausage sandwich.  

We tried to order their Sicilian pizza but they said they were out. So we had to eat a regular pizza. 

The pizza and sandwich were ok, the sauce was very lacking, like a plain tomato Sauce. I will admit I am picky with pizza sauce. 

The sandwich had the same sauce I believe as the pizza, which kinda made it not so enjoyable. But it was pretty good size and filling. 

The salad was actually pretty decent, we just got the regular house salad and added cheese. The ingredients were all fresh and crisp. I would consider ordering just a salad from here in the future if they were still open at the time we wanted to eat. 

All in all I wish we had ordered dominoes instead, but they don't have salads."}
{"text":"So..... here's the deal.  I found this place on accident about a month ago.  I stopped in and had a couple of slices and was pleasantly surprised.  I am an ex New Yorker and there pizza was the closest I have found to traditional thin crust New York style pizza.   I live pretty far from Cuginos so when I decided to go out of my way to grab a pie and a chicken parm hero today I was quite disappointed to find the quality had diminished.  I was hoping for a nice breaded chicken parm hero, but what I got was the same bland non-breaded chicken pieces they use as a topping on there pizza stuffed minimally in a small hoagie roll from a local supermarket.  Also, there sause tasted much sweeter this time around.  I will drive out of my way to pop up pizza in the Plaza down next time.  Best pizza in town by far!!!!  Step it up Cugino's."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza on North Decatur!

We've had both the tomato and basil pizza as well as the red clam. Both are very good with a nice crust. The garlic knots are good and garlicky, and the antipasto salad has cucumbers included.

Make sure if you order for delivery that you have enough cash to cover the tip when using a credit or debit card."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Hand-tossed, fire oven baked, fresh ingredients. Tasty.

Just need a little better service to earn the 5 stars. The kid up is doing a good job but the others need to smile a little more :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a white pizza and garlic knots! Fantastic service and food! Best knots I've had in town!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I have been around the world twice and tried everything at least once. My iron armored gut was destroyed by the flaming trebuchet entree at this place. First of all, for a pizza place, as in their main purpose is making pizza, you'd think they'd make a better pizza. The reason the food is so cheap is quite clear; it tastes like the quality of a piece of cardboard lathered with crappy ketchup (not even Heinz) and then dipped in egregious amounts of secondhand grease. However, being the food trooper that I am I charged on and plowed through my two slice pepperoni special, and washed it down with a double dose of carbonated lemon-lime refreshment. 

Away I went, dissatisfied and underwhelmed, but not as perturbed as to write a bad Yelp review. I believe in second chances, unless hours later the first chance gives me the most bowel shattering bubble guts I've ever had in my adult life. I'm quite literally in moderate pain as I write this, and will be shortly on my way to pick up a bottle of chalky pink goop to aid me in my agony. 

If I were you I would bypass this establishment, for you'd have a better dining experience at Robertos or Dicky's BBQ next door, even if you are if off the floor. You would also save yourself of hours of despair, and frequent worship to the porcelain God (from both ends). 

The most disappointing thing about this entire event is that my iron core has been shattered. Broken is the belief that I could eat anything without fear. The only silver lining is that they do not stock and hot sauces, and for that I am grateful. I can only imagine the savage category 5 storm that would be raging in my abdominal cavity."}
{"text":"Ive had pizza at bistro pizza, metro pizza, boston pizza and now cuginos pizza. I have to say cuginos is by far the closest ive gotten to having new york pizza here in las vegas. I Will definitly come back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to rate them. As I ordered (8:30pm) he asked if was for here or to go? I said it's for here. \"Can you finish in 30 minutes because we close at 9?\" At first I thought why would you rush a person 30 minutes before you close, then I filled up my drink and waited................15 minutes later my pizza comes out, looking all yummy and then the comment comes \"remember...only 15 minutes until we close..\" I acknowledged politely but inside of course I say, \"JERK!\"
Now the pizza was good, hard to mess up a ham and pineapple. I DID IT!!! I finished a medium pizza all by myself in 14 minutes!!! BAM! (I'm a pig, I know) anyway, I throw away my trash and hand him the pizza pan. Say thank you as he escorts me to the door to lock it behind me. I proceed to my car when it dawns on me....I don't remember paying. Usually you pay at the time you order. So I turn around walk to the door, knock....no one, knock again...same guy doesn't come to the door, he just says we're closed. I say \"I know, but I forgot to..\" WE'RE CLOSED! Perhaps he couldn't really see me through the the glass, perhaps he didn't remember what his last customer in his restaurant looked like. I could \"perhaps\" all night but the biggest perhaps is this....I just saved $16.00 and got a free meal PERHAPS he should have listened to me at the door.... I felt pretty full and good as I drove home. Thanks pizza man!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say that this location is now closed. Thank you Cuginos for the great lunches we enjoyed as a family at your restaurant."}
{"text":"For a way off the strip place, the prices do not reflect that, it is way to expensive. The specials are not that special. 2 Cold pizza slices heated up with a topping, if you choose and a drink for 5.99. Yeah, won't make the trip here again."}
{"text":"Review for deliver only. We had friends over and went with the \"it's too damn hot to cook\" option. Ordered 3 pies and the Garlic Knots using Eat24. Food was delivered in 40 minutes, they said 45-60. The pizzas, a Meat Lovers and 2 White Pizzas were actually very good. Overall, we would order their pizza again."}
{"text":"I've been eating there pizza since they had the location in the old boomerangs on rainbow, his place over on Decatur and 215 in the northwest is cozy. I like the old school this crust pizza that he makes, also do his stomboli to once in awhile. My daughter likes his calzones, they also have canolis!!! They make a lot of other Italian pastas and sandwiches but I'm a creature on habit."}
{"text":"my dad ordered a calzone which was good, a cannoli, and tiramisu. My cannoli didn't have much filling in it and when I got towards the end I realized there was something weird in my mouth, it was a huge piece of plastic. the tiramisu also had frostbite on it and was pretty much frozen."}
{"text":"Living in Japan, and finally getting a chance to have American pizza, I was anticipating something fierce and wonderful. Alas, no. The pizza was okay. It was certainly your average American pizza that could be described as a small step above Dominoes or Pizza Hut. The pizza was hot, greasy and had some toppings on top. The topping is charged for one dollar per each item, though the amount given (except for the pepperoni) was not quite $1. Not a bad place. It certainly hits all the notes of what a typical pizza has."}
{"text":"I came in got greeted with great customer service.  Got the medium-sized to go.  Really good fresh pizza! Nice crust too"}
{"text":"The first clue I should have had was walking in the door and not one customer was in the restaurant.  Second, a pizza lace without beer is pretty bad.  But we were there so ordered pizza and spaghetti.  The spaghetti was not bad, but the pizza was terrible.  For $22 the size was ok, but the toppings were horrible.  The bell peppers were out of a can instead of fresh, the sausage was an odd color.  The dough tasted vaguely of veggies.  I couldn't finish a slice.  My husband stated we would never return, and I agree."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, garlic knots good. But 3 stars is because chicken parm sandwich was disappointing. Chicken was grilled, not breaded as is normal, and was kind of meh. Prices were ok, and service quick. Would give 3.5 stars if I could. Will try again and may bump review up if next non pizza item is good"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place for years when it was still called Villa Pizza.  I spoke with the owner, and learned that he broke from the franchise because he would not conform to their cookie-cutter pizza recipe, thus had to change the name.  Thank god he did because this pizza is superb.

Authentic New York Style pizza-- what more is there to say?  The crust is thin, but not too thin; both crunchy and doughy; and the perfect  balance between cheesy and saucy.

Best pizza in Vegas, hands down."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn, so I know good pizza. Never disappointed when we come here, the pizza is great. I only give it 5 stars cause its not Brooklyn pizza but it is really good pizza.One of best that I have had outside of Brooklyn. Customer service is good enough."}
{"text":"Mi' Amor!

Superb authentic Italian. 
Not cheap but worth every penny!
The portions are very big and there is something magical about their ranch dressing, like I could drink it. 

Must haves: 
Ranch with a kick
Rigatoni Bolognese
Cannoli (small or large) 

Excellent service...Especially when we ordered for pick up 20mins before they closed and showed up when they closed (I hate doing that to people).
I really enjoyed how they packaged our to-go order too!"}
{"text":"It's always fun to try different pizza shops around the USA and see how they stack up.  Tried two slices here that were just fine."}
{"text":"How this place has 4stars is beyond me! Came to visit family and wanted food before the trip home.... something quick. My brother in law was on crutches and went to a place across the lot. We came here. We ordered 2 slices (1 cheese 1 pepperoni) w/a drink combo and garlic knotts. Before we could pay an older couple walks up with their HALF ATE EFFIN PIZZA and complained that it was too spicy and wanted a new 1 made.... The WHOLE staff stopped what they were doing INCLUDING the girl who was helping us to figure out why it was all of a sudden spicy. I actually had to shout over to them \"Hey do you mind finishing up helping us so we can get out of here... we're in a hurry to get on the road to drive 17hrs.!\" We were then told our total was 16.99.... um no. The girl said \"Oops your right\". We paid and I kid you not waited 12min for 2 slices of pizza and some garlic knotts to be.... REHEATED!! After 8min I had to walk out while kindly letting them know we have a family member on crutches waiting for us.... remember we were in a hurry? Before I left the couple who ordered after us looked at me and whispered \" a little unorganized huh?\". When my boyfriend walked out he looked really mad. Got In car and asked \" Can you believe that made that couple a BRAND NEW pizza before even HEATING up our slices?\" Never again.  Pulled across street to Costco gas to fill up and we each took 1 bite of the greasy,  soggy, mushy NASTY Pizza and spit it out and threw in garbage. The knotts were ok. I don't see how they get business. Never ever again.... should have got robertos or subs. Run run run from this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is great and I always enjoy it. I think they're devaluing their food by the type of service ware they use. Thin flimsy 1 ply napkins with super thin paper plates. I think if they upgrade that it will give more value to their food."}
{"text":"My family ate here for the first (and last) time about a week ago. We were expecting great pizza based on another review here on Yelp. Instead we discovered that the pizza was very bland and the prices were ridiculous. My wife had the thin crust pizza and I had the thick crust Sicilian pizza. We were charged $4 to add pepperoni and olives to two slices of pizza! Almost as much as the slices themselves cost. My wife asked about the garlic knot bread and was told she could have a sample with our lunch, but the sample was not there when our food arrived. To top it all off, the pizza was mediocre with very bland sauce that tasted like it came out of a can. If you are a fan of terrible pizza, such as Domino's or Little Caesar's, this place might be right up your alley. If you are a fan of good pizza, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious 5 stars... the only down side is that they have a limited menu compared to the location by UNLV. Hopefully they will have the same options in the near future, cause I love the reuben sandwich."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great people, stepping into the store takes you to little Italy, or maybe Italy itself.   Best thing of all the food. AMAZING pie! (pizza pie that is).  If you know New York pizza then you know what we mean.  If you like NY pizza then you will Love Cugino's.  If you re looking for a great Italian deli, these folks do way more than pizza and everything I have tried has been spectacular."}
{"text":"Today I came in with my wife, a friend and 5 kids. The young man who helped us did awesome by us. The pizza was fast and delicious,  he was right there if we needed anything.  He even hooked the kids up with a small toy. I didn't catch his name but he was super nice and helpful.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  the Pizza Lunch special is great at a great rice, all the ingredients are always fresh, I'd take this place over any of the chain restaurants 10 times out of 10!"}
{"text":"This pizza has a great bite. Crispy out and chewy in. I like how they slice there sausage like pepperoni. Took 37 years on west coast to find a pizza that had a perfect east coast slice. Not only is the pizza great so is the staff,delivery is spot on."}
{"text":"Craving a GOOD pizza the other day, and while searching for the original/other store in the middle of town, I saw I had a Cugino's in my neck of the woods this WHOLE time!

Whenever I see a WHITE pizza available,it's almost a guarantee I'll order it!  

So of course, I ordered the Large White Pizza ($17.99): Ricotta, Romano & Mozzarella Cheese, Pepperoni and Italian Sausage. They have an excellent white pizza here! Although I enjoyed both toppings, the Pepperoni was winner today.  I felt like the portion size, toppings, and taste were all worth the entry price.

And there was just the RIGHT amount of cheese, grease and fat on this bad boy.   If your pizza isn't oily, greasy and fatty...I don't wanna eat it!

Also ordered the Garlic Knots ($2.99). These were VERY good...a bit more crispy than most, but very tender breading on the inside and LOTS of garlic flavor!  Yum :)

If a pizza place can't make a good garlic knot, chances are they can't make a good pie either!  Rest assured, Cugino's can do both well...in my book :)"}
{"text":"In my opinion, it's just pizza. Nothing special to write home about."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once and it's been several months since then but was a regular at the Maryland location. They don't have all the offerings at this one, but pizza was still great. Awesome crust and chewy cheese, just how I like it. Reminded me of my late nights studying at UNLV with my friends with our \"coochi's pizza.\" Love it."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty darn good. Sauce is excellent and the crust is even better. The pizza is cooked in a brick oven and gives the crust a real Italian taste to it. Had just the right amount of cheese and meats. I ordered over the phone and was told about 15-20 minutes. Got there and the pizzas were sitting there ready to go. I love things to be on time and they were nice and hot. I ordered a pepperoni and a meat lovers. The meat lovers was loaded and the meats were very very tasteful. They definitely didn't skimp on either pizza.

The only thing I could even complain even a little bit about was the price. The pizza's I got were 2 medium's and the price came out to just over $28 but that is the only thing I could complain about even just a little bit. I feel 2 medium pizza's shouldn't be more than $25 at the most.

Other than that, if you are looking for great tasting pizza and a friendly staff then I would definitely give Cugino's Pizzeria a whirl."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this place..although the customer service was good. The food was not:(  Pizza tasted old, knots had no flavor..super bummed out.."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Cugino's (formerly Villa Pizza) for as long as it has been in Vegas.  As a kid I remember walking in to what I would call a typical dive pizza joint.  The owner/manager was an avid Jeopardy watcher, a trait for which my family has coined him \"Jeopardy man.\"  

Although the ambience leaves something to be desired, the pizza is remarkable.  Thin crunchy crust topped with a smooth, understated pizza sauce and just the right amount of salty, gooey cheese makes for the best  texture, flavor & craving satisfaction.  Without a doubt the absolute best pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I love the pizza! We always order for pickup and it's always a 15 minute wait which is understandable! Sadly, every time we arrive 15-20 minutes after ordering, the pizza is never ready to be picked up. we always end up waiting another 5 minutes. The dough has great flavor and their crust rises nicely. The amount of crunch is good and it's not too floppy or soft like other pizza places. Obviously you'll easily spend $40 on 2 large pizzas but the quality is great."}
{"text":"Arrived here 30 min before they were closing. The girl at the front answered the phone while we waited to order. So the rude man who was cooking came up to take our order. My daughter really wanted pasta. They refused and said no more pasta for the night since they were closing in 20 minutes...  Apparently their clock is fast and at the end of the night service becomes crappy. My husband decided that we should order anyway and get her a side of meatballs instead. I ordered a drink with my food. I didn't get it. When my husband asked to get a drink the guy at the back came up again and acted like this was our fault. I left to sit in the car.  My husband brought out the food. It was nothing special. They should can the old grumpy guy"}
{"text":"I LIVE FOR THEIR PIZZA! plain ol'.pepperoni to the meat lover's special, they perform witch magic, that's how addicting it is"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special which included 2 pieces of pizza and a drink for $7.99. Overall it was good and crispy.  It was just a little too greasy for my liking but I was able to get most of it off with a napkin. Great place for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"It's not bad but not great either.  

Basically, if the crust doesn't wooo me I am just gonna call a place \"ok.\"

I had the white pizza with clams.  The pizza did have a very generous portion of clams on it and the flavor was good.  The crust is an average crust... it's just okay.

This place is worth while for a slice of pie... but not on my top ten list."}
{"text":"Just clearing the reviews saying that the peppers and apparently onions are \"pre-cooked\" and put on after, this isnt true... They obviously put all the ingredients on the pizza and put it in the oven.. You can watch them.. Dont write review if you dont know what your talking about. This place has great food and really good salads and everything is fresh and cooked right in front of your face! With real cheese and real everything 100x better than your average pizza hut. I've eaten every item on the menu and have no complaints. (:"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, they used to be on rainbow n vegas at Boomerangs back in the da under Villa Pizza the chain. Their formula hasnt changed. Really good flavor, reminds me of NYC."}
{"text":"Only these kinds of shops have the best pizza, by far better then dominos, Pizza Hut and papa johns.. Delivery was fast, only took 25 min, pizza was cooked perfectly and garlic knots were awesome.. A little pricey but very very much worth it, only bad thing is about the tips, they can't put it on credit cards which kinda sucks because I never carry cash on me, but besides that I would definitely recommend this place, plus its very close to us so a bigger plus!"}
{"text":"So i went home to help my folks tile the hallway. My mom knows that i love to try new places and she couldn't keep talking about this place. So on my first night home, we just had to try it.

We walked into an empty restaurant, but that didn't stop us form trying it out. The brick oven was blazing and my stomach was needing food. We ordered the everything pizza and a dozen garlic knots.

The chef went right away to warming up our knots and then creating out pizza. Nothing like watching them make your pizza on the spot. Our garlic knots arrived at our table soon after we finished filling our drinks. I have had better garlic knots, but these were not drenched in butter or oil like most places so i was happy with that. The sauce was cold, sorry but I'm a warm marinara guy.

Our pizza came straight out of the oven, Thank goodness we still had knots to nibble on or else i would of burnt my mouth, it looked that fantastic! The dough reminded me of a boston style, and i love my boston crust. The topping were fresh and delicious, not to much cheese and the proper amount of everything. Just all around a perfect pizza.

On our way out we did see a sign about $5 specials for a coke and 2 slices. I'm sure they get more business during lunch time based on that sign."}
{"text":"Love Cuginos been growing here for several years.

Our pizzas are fresh and made to order.  I also love the Stromboli.  We always order one of each.

We have used home delivery, which is always within the promised time.  On weekends we usually pick up our order as they are very busy, and promised delivery takes longer."}
