{"text":"walton needed a new food spot and they finally have it. simple, delicious food with great service. Well priced, big portions. Love what the owners did with the place! We had a great reuben, caesar salad, fish/shrimp basket, and waffle fries. Yum! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a DO NOT MISS cafe! The new owners are so nice, the food is great, portions unreal and the price is right! You may have seen it.. and passed by.. NEXT TIME  BE SURE TO STOP!"}
{"text":"Best of the best old Oregon style eatery. Good food, good service, good price. Any native Oregonian would be proud to call this one of their favorite restaurants. Thomas Finney."}
{"text":"We flew up to Eugene last week and stopped here enroute to our destination of Florence. The lunch special that day was a pasta dish with multiple types of peppers and Italian sausage. This plate was absolutely delicious. All of the ingredients were quite fresh and tasty. The pomodoro sauce was the perfect consistency for this dish, and was made with fresh tomatoes, not canned sauce like many restaurants do. My wife had a turkey sandwich that she loved. We stopped here again on our way back to the Eugene airport and shared a triple meat sandwich. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! Wish I had more room in my belly so that I could eat another one. Yes, this place is that good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast extra filling
And good hamburgers too. The staff here are very nice and good is fast."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised!  What a delight.
Poached eggs were perfect as was everything else from my wonderful
latte to the muffins to the bacon.
Wonderful food and service.  Great stopping point between Eugene and
the beach."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner and all 4 of us were impressed with the food and service. The outside seating for summer will be perfect as there are only 5 booths inside. Can't wait to go for breakfast and for prime rib. A real treat all the way around."}
{"text":"Best customer service!  The food was perfect and the portions were huge!!! Coffee was excellent!  The only thing that would make this place better would be mimosas!!! Worth the drive! You got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"We come through every year for the Oregon Country Fair and saw this place empty for a long time. This year, we were surprised to see it open with a cute outside dining/lounge area. I stopped in to check out the place and saw a quaint cafe, with a full espresso set up and a few booths. We decided to get dinner and left full, happy and satisfied. I had a loaded baked potato with a cup of chili and my father had the special, which was meatloaf with mashed potatoes, veggies and gravy. FIRST: everything was DELICIOUS. The skin on my potato was crisp and it was actual bakers potato. My fathers meatloaf was slathered in gravy (which we agree is the RIGHT way to eat gravy on anything). Everything was so good and the woman working was an absolute sweetheart. We can't wait to stop in next year!"}
{"text":"Recently, well within about 6 or so months, opened Restuarant.  Love their coffee.  I always get what the call, A Cowboy.  It's basically their version of an Americano.  Breakfast is from 8-11AM.  They have a very popular prime rib on Fridays.  Only 5 booths and I've seen them turn people away since it's so popular.   Prices are very reasonable. Today, I had a good Chicago Dog with Cesar Salad.  Service is exceptional. Great midpoint break place between Eugene and the Coast. 

A bonus, LPG canisters are .40 cents cheaper per gal too."}
{"text":"OMG for a small cafe in the middle of nowhere in Walton, Oregon it has great large portions at an affordable price. I had the chicken cordon blue dinner for $14. Their dinners come with drink, bread, salad, main meal, and dessert. My mom had their pulled pork sandwich that's she said was juicy smoky and favorable bbq sauce. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"No pets allowed... Grass area has no animals on grass signs. 
I come prepared to pick up after my dog.
$5 minimum to use their bathroom.
No hospitality... No business from me.
Good bye"}
{"text":"We drove in from Florence to the Halfway Cafe, located right next to the Walton store midway between Florence and Eugene on Hwy. 126. The restaurant was recently re-opened by owners who have created a down home style vibe with food to match.  We went for breakfast. I had a wonderful housemade corned beef hash with two eggs and hash browns. My friends ordered French toast and a half order of biscuits and gravy, also made in house. 
Everything was tasty. Big portions. I took half of mine home. I am looking forward to returning to try lunch and dinner offerings, including the prime rib dinner special on Friday nights!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Cute little cafe and store. The owner couldn't be nicer! All homemade food...I had the ham and cheese breakfast sandwich with hash browns and a pancake. (The pancake was about an inch thick!) My dad had the Logger Special and man, it was a lot of food!  My step-mom had eggs Benedict and the eggs were beautifully round and tasted amazing! Definitely will return anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"You won't want to miss stopping here to or from the coast, as it is the best dining experience there is in this 50-mile radius!  The charm of the owners, the friendly warm atmosphere, the superb service, and outstanding homemade food cannot be beat.  Bar none!  The portions are generous, hot, and delicious.  It has a small diner feel with limited seating.  There's no way you will be disappointed eating here!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place with nice diner style food. Great service too. Super friendly. We had some breakfast food and coffee. Stop here for sure!"}
