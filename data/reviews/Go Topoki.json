{"text":"We have a new challenger in the Finch corridor! After having to stomach (no pun intended) the opening of one Asian noodle bar after another, we finally get something new - a Korean style dokbokki snack bar.

We attended Topoki's soft opening weekend November 4th (30% off!). We were greeted by very friendly and attentive servers and a brightly lit space. There are stairs that lead up to a couple tables on the second floor and that also houses the kitchen - the servers must get quite a workout over their shift going up and down!

Prices are very reasonable, I suggest coming in pairs or more in order to share dishes in true Korean style. We ordered the spicy red Topoki ($8), much to the servers' surprise. \"Are you sure?\" \"Be careful!\" It turned out to be Korean spicy. Spicy but not unmanageable. 

We also got the vegetable fries / fried vegetables ($8), which is a mix of gimmari (glass noodles wrapped in deep fried seaweed), mandu (dumplings with glass noodles), and battered vegetables (onion and sweet potato seemed most common). 

The reason why it's best to share plates is that by themselves, the plates are looking for something to complement themselves. The Topoki plates are mostly rice cake with a couple odeng (fish cakes) topped with green onion in a red spicy sauce. Good, but it really benefits from the fried-ness of the other snacks. And the snacks are really good when mixed with the red Topoki sauce!

We were pleased with the overall experience and will definitely come again. I know the area will benefit from its uniqueness and hopefully will encourage other businesses to branch out too!"}
{"text":"Boldly serving authentic Seoul street food, in an upscale bar vibe, without wallet cleansing.

Just enough service, this crew knows how to be attentive without being intrusive for parties of any size.  Even one.

Sapporo off their tap are six bucks a pint. If you order their popcorn chicken with it, you save a buck.  At ten dollars in Dec 2017.

The  popcorn chicken, five dollars, has just enough batter and crunchy goodness that you can actually satisfy your Korean chicken craving. Without spending twenty and taking home half.

Then there is the fishcake. Exactly the way you remembered it from Seoul street vendors, in jumbo skewers and with a huge bowl of clear broth (yes, it has MSG and it is super cheap everywhere in Seoul) to bring back all those memories of home.  Always served piping hot (3 times out of 3).   No Hmart frozen sticks (like others joints around) here for sure. Two skewers, enough for a light meal, five bucks!

Now onto the tobokki.  If you are into Seoul street tobokki, there are two elements that you are likely to be craving for... after all it really is just a sort of pasta, flour product..... the sauce and the texture.

You have choices for sauces. But take my word for it, try their signature Rose Sauce. Their is just enough fusion in this creamy mix to satisfy both the North American and expat Asian palette. If spiciness isn't your thing, make sure to ask for regular, non spicey. The Rose with Bacon is a perfect starter intro if it is your first visit. Forgive the deep fried hot dog on top. It is just a boomerang motif from the North Americanization of Seoul food. 

As for the texture? No word coming to mind describes it except \"perfect\".  It is that certain piping hot so al-dente chewy bite after bite feeling that drives some to travel around the world to seek. It is a treasure.  Hope they can maintain it through time.

Without doubt a great add to the Toronto uptown food scene!"}
{"text":"I was omw to soon tofu and this shop stopped me. I love raboekki (doekbokki + ramen) after watching korean soaps. And this place rice cakes are really soft and chewy.. The texture is great. I had the original red sauce and added cheese and ramen. Fatty I know. But i downed this in 10mins by myself. A bit on the sweet side. I think I would have liked it a bit more salty. But the flavour was great. Regular spice is enough for me. I could probs go spicier if I wanted to. Im Chinese and  love Korean food though."}
{"text":"Went here today around 7:30pm. This place was packed already! Their menu was easy to understand and kinda cute. I wanted to try the autentic flavor so we ordered Red topoki, Bulgogi Kimchi rice with cheese, popcorn chicken and Sapporo beer. The Red topoki was  savory and had decent amount of spicy flavor. (I don't mind even if it's little sweeter.) Although i prefer a little softer and pillowy rice cake, this rice cake wasn't bad. It had a very similar texture as tapioca from bubble tea. What I really thought so delicious was Bulgogi Kimchi Rice with cheese!. This was a gem. Sweet, savory and cheesy. Mmm i will come back to eat this again. They had Popcorn chicken and Sapporo beer for $10 i'm which i think its a great deal. All dishes were very filling. We wanted to try bingsoo but we were too full. Im going to come back and try it next time! Oh i think they should be on Uber Eat so when i feel lazy i can just order lol"}
{"text":"Got the red extra spicy seafood topoki with extra ramen. It was pretty good, squid and mussels were cooked well. Shrimp was definitely overcooked. Popcorn chicken was well seasoned and crispy. Water was served luke warm.

Well taken care of by the servers and the washroom had a cool flashing light strips."}
{"text":"Stopped by Go Topoki for their soft opening. Had the brown topoki, popcorn chicken, and green tea bingsu. The topoki was a bit salty for my taste but overall delicious. The popcorn chicken was my favourite. The batter is very thin and soft which highlighted and complimented the tenderness of chicken. The bingsu size was smaller in size that bingsu from other places. However, their ice has an underlying flavour that makes it very unique. Would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"Good and interesting food! Very tasty. We order the  sea food choice with mussels, very creamy! Cute spoon and fork sets. The only thing is that the restaurant must have issues with ventilation it smokes so much."}
{"text":"Spicy ricecake spot that just opened up... was excited to see it finally open. They serve 3 different types of ricecakes (red, white and brown) and I tried 2 of them. Red (spicy) one was alright and the White (carbonara) was decent. Everything tasted fine and the service was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. Decent but probably won't be going back. So unfortunate :("}
{"text":"I feel like I'm ALWAYS in the mood for rice cakes, and Go Topoki has so many flavors and toppings to choose from. This isn't your traditional Korean restaurant, it's more of a fusion...? 

You're able to pick from the traditional spicy sauce, creamy white sauce, rose sauce..etc. You choose from toppings like seafood, cheese, and add ramen if you'd like. 

Aside from rice cakes, they also sell bingsu - Korean shaved ice. I haven't tried it yet, but will report back once I have! They look like yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Sauces are tasty. But rice cake is super heavy. Cooking time was rather long. Cutlery is cute. We had a spicy rose seafood and bacon white sauce. Added ramen to the white for our kids. Added glass noodles to the rose. The fried platter was super greasy. Couldn't really stomach it. 

There are no vegetables on the menu (save a few fried potatoes and sweet potatoes on the fried platter). 

It was a good adventure but not sure we will be back. Perhaps to try dessert. But the topoki was just too heavy for us."}
{"text":"Takeout orders aren't usually worth mentioning, but I picked up a takeout order from Go Topoki last week and was pleasantly surprised to find a tiny plastic serrated utensil that came in the bag to pierce and cut open the TV-dinner style sealed plastic packaging.  Even the spoons and forks came nearly folded and tucked into each napkin.  Such minor details, but it makes me feel like they put care and attention into their their products.

While I enjoyed the Red Regular Topoki with cheese, which came with fish cakes and a hard-boiled egg in the thick, mild gochujang sauce, the Brown Bulgogi Topoki topped with glass noodles was ultimately the winner of our night.  The sauce is on the sweeter side, but mixed together with the glass noodles, it somehow just felt more satisfying.

I liked the ginmari / deep fried seaweed spring roll and my partner polished off an entire order of soondae blood sausage, which came accompanied by a side of salt, sesame seeds, and chilli powder.  While the popcorn chicken gives you a really fair portion at $6, they weren't very crispy and were a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the dishes we had ordered."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack and ordered the regular ddukboki with cheese and ramen. It was pretty good, but definitely not the best that I've had. Interior was nice and clean!"}
{"text":"Read a friend's review on this restaurant and wanted to come for a try. I was curious about the meaning of the name of the restaurant. According to Goggle, \"topoki\" means street food. I arrived at the restaurant a bit earlier than its opening hours. The waitress is kind enough to let me come into the restaurant and sit down. 

The restaurant is bright with a cheerful theme colour of bright yellow. It makes me feel happy. The use of colours for the decoration is a wise choice, white, yellow and gray. I feel relaxed and comfortably free sitting down and waiting.

Ordered the restaurant's signature rose sauce with seafood and ramen and another order of Gimmari, fried seaweed with rice. My order came shortly after.

Signature Rose Sauce with Seafood and Ramen (score 5/5)
The sauce is fantastic!! Creamy, smooth, slightly sweet and spicy. I believe I will be content just to have the sauce with plain rice. The rice cake is chewy. There are quite a lot of seafood on the plate, squid, mussels, and shrimps. Yum Yum!!

Dried Seaweed with Glass Noodles (score: 5/5)
What more can you ask for?! The seaweed on the outside is crispy and crunchy while the glass noodles inside is soft. It's just perfect!

This is another Korean restaurant I highly recommend to my friends and Yelpers. 

ps: visit the washroom, you will be amused to see the lighting effects!"}
{"text":"This little place hit my craving right on the spot. I may be biased because of how much I like spicy rice cakes, but I am pretty picky when it comes to it. 

I ordered the original red topoki and my girlfriend ordered the cream one with sausage. We also got the fried chicken to share. The fried chicken was nothing special. Not bad but nothing amazing either. But the rice cakes were one of the better ones that I've had in the GTA. It was a little spicy, which is expected, but not overwhelming. 

I think the price is fair given how much other places charge in that area. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wow - who would've thought rice cakes and fish cakes could look so aesthetically pleasing. This modern, minimalistic Korean street food joint is where it's at when you're looking to take some photos. 

We ordered a few different things: \"Kloud\" beer - Korean beer that tasted very smooth, a bit sweet, and light. For food we got spicy rice cake with 'red' sauce aka gochujang (they also offer bulgogi, cream, and rosé sauce - how fancy!!!) You can also add extras for $2 each - cheese, ramen, etc. 

We also got soondae (blood sausage), fish cakes that come with a yummy broth that's a staple combination with the spicy rice cake, and the fries platter which consists of Korean style veggie fries, gimmari (fried glass noodles wrapped with seaweed), and mandu (dumplings). 

Although we ordered the spicy rice cake, it wasn't as spicy as we thought it would be. Rather, it was a little bland and the consistency was a bit too watery. Each rice cake dish is the perfect portion to eat for one person, or to share if you're ordering other things as well. 

I'm hoping to try the different sauces for the rice cakes - especially when I'm feeling bougie with that rosé."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time with just a take-out order. The server was incredibly kind and pleasant. 

I ordered the red Topoki in *extra spicy*, not even thinking twice about the heat level. HOLY CRAP: extra spicy here is REALLY FREAKIN' SPICY, to the point where I could only eat a little bit of the meal, then had to chug an entire bottle of water before I could attempt a bit more food. \"Extra spicy\" at Go Topoki is HARD CORE! But despite my apparent wimpy-ness with the heat level, the dish was really good, and I look forward to going back and trying it again -- with muuuuuch less spice ;) 

Nice touch: plastic utensils are neatly wrapped in a cute serviette 'pocket'."}
{"text":"Everyone knows i LOVE ricecakes. When i found out of this restaurant, i knew i must check this place out.

This restaurant is nice and bright- you can't really miss it when you are walking down on Yonge street.
When i arrived the restaurant it wasn't too busy, we were greeted by the staff very quickly. Restaurant is very clean with lots of comfortable seating.

Their menu is fairly simple.. you get to choose the sauce and each sauce has 2 options of ricecakes. You can choose the spicy levels and add additional toppings as well.

We ended up with their signature rosé sauce with bacon & the bulgogi kimchi rice with cheese. 
These are both $10 only - decently sized portion and super tasty!! 

I would love to come back and try the other stuff on their menu as well."}
{"text":"Rice cakes, rice cakes, rice cakes! One of my many new found loves!!! The chewy yummy-ness makes this place a wonderful choice when you want them rice cakes ONLY!

I have been here twice now because I was not fully satisfied the first time I tried this new restaurant. It's an ok sized place with some seating on the second floor as well. Not meant for big groups and their table set up are mostly for 2 to 4 people. That being said, by all means come with more people (if you love dem rice cakes and wanna share the joyous experience with your friends)! I'm sure they can shimmy the tables over.

Moving on! The RICE CAKES! The first time I came here, I had the brown sauce with bulgogi, ramen and cheese with spicy level 1. Everything tasted great at first...until the flavor just became overwhelming...luckily that was near the end but I just couldn't handle the strong flavor for some reason. Aside from that, everything else was delish! Rice cakes were on point chewy! Second time I came, I had the white sauce with seafood, ramen and cheese, no spicy. THIS was what I was looking for! It was a tad heavy but if I could keep eating more I would have! The flavors went very well together and it was just sooooo good! Rice cakes were perfect again!

So what more can I say? If I want rice cakes, I have my official go to now! I definitely want to try their rosé sauce next time and I am looking forward to it! So far my all time favourite is the white sauce with seafood!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Along Yonge St, north of Church St. It's within one of the places underneath a series of apartment complexes
- Mostly street parking available
- Restaurant sign is a little small, so had a small difficulty finding it. But inside decor is very bright and spacious. They have cute utensils that are heavy and sturdy to use
- Staff were nice and friendly

Food
- Tried an appetizer and a main (only have a pic of the main)
- Appetizer was a series of fried goods like dumplings and zucchini. Typical Korean-style fried goods. They're tasty, and not overly battered.
- Main was a seafood rice cake with rose sauce. Portion wise was okay (considered shareable). Like the original kind of Topoki, it is very saucy - and it was surprisingly tasty. The rice cake were chewy and filling. But the seafood mussels were a little disappointing (small meat portion), and only had 1 shrimp.


Overall this place is a-okay! I would probably swing by with a few friends to try their other fusion topoki sauces. I like how they have a little variety to make it interesting."}
{"text":"I love topokki!! Came here very excited for some authentic Korean food and was not let down. Our masseuse recommended the spot. The topokki was very authentic, we also grabbed the dumplings! The service was great, there wasn't a time we were waiting for anything. My only disappointment was that they didn't bring out the traditional Korean appetizers like cabbage and bean sprouts! I've never gone to a place for topokki and had no appetizers come out. Besides this i loved the place."}
{"text":"I have never had Topoki before, but Go Topoki has me keen for more!

My girlfriend and I came here on a whim since the bakery we had originally planned to visit was closed. 

The two floor restaurant has a clean and modern decor. Their white and yellow theme is cute! 

Since we've never had Topoki before, we asked the server what the portion sizes were like. He said that Topoki dishes were for one person, but we shared one dish because we already had something to eat. I think that their Topoki is a good size for one person if you're running on empty.

Their lunch special was $10 with an included drink. We ordered their bacon and sausage Topoki with the rosé sauce base and a hot apple cidar. The sauce was slightly spicy, which made the flavour profile much more interesting. Topoki is similar to Shanghai style Nian Gao--since I've never had it before, I cannot comment on its authenticity. I will say that the sauce was creamy and not overly oily. That being said, it was absolutely delicious! 

The food came quickly and the server was delightful. We paid at the front when we were ready and were never pressured to leave. 

Go Topoki has a café-like ambiance with serious kitchen chops--don't miss it if you're in the area! 

I can't wait to return and try their regular spicy gojuchang sauce base Topoki!"}
{"text":"This is a cute snack place with a variety of rice cake dishes and korean snacks. 

I would recommend ordering a few dishes and sharing amongst your group.

We ordered the cream based topoki (with bacon) $10, fish cakes in a broth (2 for $5)  popcorn chicken ($6). 

The creamy topoki is delicious and very different than the traditional topoki in gojujang sauce. The fish cakes were good - perfect for a cold day and the popcorn chicken was decent. 

The service is very attentive and they are super polite. 

They also offer desserts as well. I will def. come back and try the rest of the menu items."}
{"text":"Brightly lit restaurant, with a second floor with more seating.

The washrooms have this lighting that flashes red, green, and blue, which provides excellent ambiance...but for what purpose exactly...? Curious.

If you ask for water, they will give you a glass filled with pieces of ice and water on the side. You are free to then pour the water into your glass.

Ordered the rose topoki with bacon. The dish is a bit smaller than I would have liked, in that there were probably a dozen pieces of rice cakes, and like 3 or 4 pieces of the other stuff that comes with it. But it's $10 I guess. The sauce was enjoyable though.

I went with regular spicy. There was some kick to it. A few others at the table ordered the spicy and extra spicy and they were just wiping sweat off, so keep in mind that it's a korean restaurant and their spice levels might be a bit different.

Clothes smelled like the restaurant afterwards. Not too pleasant."}
{"text":"I came here after a feature on @blogto. I was not disappointed! This place was SO good. Firstly, the place is pretty small, can hold about 30 people at once and table are fairly close. But the insides are RIDICULOUSLY asthetic. I'm talking White Walls, high ceilings, minimalistic decorations. 

The people working are very friendly and super nice. They were able to rearrange a bunch of our orders. 

Lastly the food was absolutely yummy. The toppoki was super chewy but yet very flavourful. Basically it's like thick noodles that soak up flavours really nicely. I customized it so I got white sauce and veggies with some ramen noodles at the bottom.

All our dishes was super filling and worth the cost. They used very unique flavourful that makes my mouth just want more! I definitely recommend getting the whole package, with the ramen and sides."}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving good rice cake. I saw it online and had to make rounds to go there one day.

I got the white sauce rice cake with cheese and sausage. Think of it like a western pasta but with rice cake instead. Chewy well cooked and flavourful.

I next got the traditional spicy ricecake. Accompanied by sliced fish cake which was plentiful. It was not too spicy but strong enough to keep one eating. The ricecake and porttions for both dishes were very satisfying.

Lastly I got the fried platter. Again it was quite big surprisingly since its a appetizer. Well fried not over fried and crispy but not too heavy or thick in batter. It's a small little place with a few choices specializing in the few dishes."}
{"text":"Cute utensils and great service however food was just mediocre. Got the rose seafood and majority of the clams had sand in it...also ordered some sides including the veggie fritters and that was a let down. Overall decent but nothing so good that will make me come back."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often but I loved everything about this place. First of all, Korean rice cakes is one of the best stuff ever and it was cooked so well here. I loved it! While usually I can't handle how spicy it is at typical Korean restaurants, this place wins my favour due to the customization options. You can choose your spice level, sauce type, and topping. Second of all, the place is freaking adorable - clean and cute aesthetic with sunny yellow and bright greens. I also love that they have a coat rack and umbrella bucket. Considerate of their customers, yes. Also, they have a clean and spacious bathroom. I really dislike restaurants with dirty or cramped bathrooms as a slight germiphobe, and this one was quite nice. Get the rose sauce at spicy for a mild kick but nothing too hot. I got the seafood spicy rose toppoki with cheese... No regrets. It was so tasty. Service is also very fast, friendly, and accommodating."}
{"text":"Go Topoki is a restaurant featuring Korean rice cakes (tteokbokki).  It's located on Yonge Street 15 minutes south of Finch Station.  It's a relatively new restaurant (opened just in November 2017) and is very modern inside with bright yellow walls and chairs and a gorilla as a mascot.

The menu at Go Topoki is predominantly all about the Korean stir-fried rice cakes and it comes in four different sauces (Red, White, Brown, and Rosé) with various ingredients tossed into it.

Korean stir-fried rice cakes can be a hit or miss.  We ordered the Rosé Topokki which was their signature red sauce with cream.  We chose the bacon option which consisted of bacon, broccoli, onion, and red peppers.

I liked that their utensils had cute faces on them!

The order came out quickly by one of the two servers that was working there in the restaurant that night.  I felt bad for the two servers who had to constantly climb and walk down the single flight of stairs all night long to get the food.  Apparently their kitchen was on the second floor so every time they had to deliver the cooked food, they had to walk up and down the stairs to get the food to us.

The topokki thankfully was quite good.  It was the right consistency of chewiness and tenderness.  The rice cakes' texture wasn't hard at all which can always be a deterrent when it comes to rice cakes.  There was an abundance of the rosé sauce so that all of the rice cakes were drenched in it.  This was a good thing though because when rice cakes are dry, they taste terrible.

The rosé sauce sauce was thick and quite spicy (and quite salty by itself).  While there were a lot of bacon in the dish, there were fewer onions, and even fewer broccoli and red peppers in the dish.  I would say that the broccoli and red peppers were practically non-existent.

The dish was topped with a meticulously scored plain hot dog sausage.

It'll be interesting to see how Go Topoki fares in the upcoming months and years.  Their menu also includes snacks like popcorn chicken and fish cake skewers, rice and noodle options, and dessert like bingsu too.  It seemed like a good place to order a variety of topokki dishes and snacks to share over chitchatting.

The servers were prompt with serving us since it wasn't very busy there on a Saturday night.  Their washrooms were very clean and interesting with flashing lights installed around the mirror."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere ( friendly and spacious) and the decor (cute and contemporary, and yellow) of this restaurant. 

As soon as you walk in, you notice the restaurant is spacious and brightly lit. Yellow and white color chairs alternate around the tables and not to mention the high ceiling!! This is what set Go Topoki apart from all the other little 300 square feet boxed restaurants on yonge street in north york. 

This is great place for date night, girls night, gossip nights...you name it! You can sit down for a nice meal without worrying spending a fortune here. Service is friendly and good! 

The food is not fancy. But comfort food at its best. Carbs carbs. Sauce sauce. Yummmmm. 

I would save yourself some money and avoid the popcorn chicken. The seaweed spring roll, on the contrary, is the best I've had! Get it!! 

I think they also have beer or some alcoholic drinks. So yeah...sit down, chat away, and when you are done eating dinner and you want some desserts, you don't even have to get up and move!! They offer shaved ice which are very good as well. 

All I have to say is: Go To Go To poki."}
{"text":"I was supposed to go home to cook tonight as it was cold and Monday, until I walked by Go Topoki. I've walked by here multiple times and finally they opened.

This is an extremely interesting place, where you can order fish cake soup and fish cake stick. Korean Street food, but with beer!!!! A pint of Sapporo is only $6. I really enjoyed the pop corn chicken as it was not greasy and good size. Will definitely return!!

Service was very friendly and attentive!

Solid 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant pops up in the Yonge/Finch area and it doesn't disappoint. Go Topoki's game are rice cakes and is worth a visit if you're in the area.

Food ****
We ordered the red sauce topoki and the seafood white sauce topoki along with the fried food platter. All of the food was good and the rice cakes are heavy and filling. Ordering the fries platter is a good combo with topoki sauce you use to dip it in. While the food was good, it is a bit pricey for korean street food. Drinks here fairly priced.

Service ***
Service was ok, decently attentive.

Ambiance *****
Recently opened and renovated, it is vibrant, new, and a fun place to take a date on.

Tips/Closing comments
- Order their fries platter and use the topoki sauce as dipping sauce"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and ordered the rosé seafood topoki and the bulgogi kimchi cheese rice. It all tasted pretty good and we liked that we could choose the spice level of the topoki. The kimchi in the rice dish was a bit more spicy than we expected but other than that it was great! We would come back!"}
{"text":"My partner LOVES tteok. He makes it at home when he could. We decided to go with the classic red sauce with cheese and got a white sauce. We really liked the white sauce as it's something new to us. I think this will be our only visit."}
{"text":"For the name of the restaurant to have their main dish in the name, I expect them to excel in topoki. Needless to say, staff were friendly and polite, place is clean and comfortable but minimal seating. Prices are decent as well.

There are three main sauces with the Topoki: brown (soy sauce base), white (cream) or regular (spicy gojuchang). Overall I enjoyed the regular one and the regular spicy was already spicy for me, but I don't normally stand spicy that well. That being said, the topoki was soft and chewy and well cooked, and the accompaniments (fish cakes etc) were well seasoned and cooked. 

The soy base one was a tad bit sweeter than I would like but it did balance out the spiciness from the other. The topoki in this one was a bit under, hence the 3 star rating.

I also ordered their fried app, with seaweed roll, fried yams, and dumplings. All were flavourful but nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall satisfying the taste bud if you crave topoki. They also serve shaved ice (bingsu) but we didn't try it."}
{"text":"Got the red spicy seafood topoki rice cakes with cheese. It was SOoOooOOoooOOO good. Rice cakes were super chewy and the spicy sauce was very authentic. I probably wouldn't get the seafood again just cause it's hard to eat and can get a bit messy.

The owners also gave us free deep fried kimbap and fritters. Was pretty bland but nice of them to show us the other items on their menu.

Portions were normal, not particularly small or big. 10/10 would come back! The decor is awesome too - simple and clean. And they have cool neon lights in the bathroom lol"}
{"text":"4 stars for the seafood white topoki!  The sauce was rich and creamy.  The topoki was chewy.  It's like a crossover between Korean street food and Western pasta.  

3 stars for the regular red topoki.  It's similar to the one you can get at any Korean supermarket. Nothing special.

3 stars for the fried platter.  The mandu was nice - not too garlicky.  The other 2 items were so-so.

3.5 stars overall.  A bit pricey for Korean street food but the atmosphere made up for it.  Service was kind of slow.  Will probably come back for the white topoki."}
{"text":"This place was a bit hard to find but just note it's technically facing Yonge street. The line was so long at Konjiki, we decided to check out options in the areas. I've  driven past this several times with the distinctive gorilla logo which looked awesome. It's a nice open space.  The heater once you enter is so satisfying.

I noticed that there was a special on the door for karrage so we ordered Sapporo on tap along with karrage ($2 off the regular price). We also ordered the bulgolgi brown sauce, the regular red and the sea food white. We added a rice dish as well to top it all off. It was a good quantity for four people. Maybe a little too much..... The karrage was decent. The regular red was pretty good overall. I'd caution against going too spicy as it is actually spicy. The most intriguing dish was the seafood in the white sauce. It was like a fusion dish of Italian meets traditional. I'm not much of a fan of pasta but this was awesome. Would highly recommend ordering this one if you are here. The bulgolgi brown was alright. Everyone opted to finish the other dishes more. Side note: this place has cute looking utensils. Overall would return if I'm feeling rice cakes. This was pretty good along with attentive service."}
{"text":"Standard stuff....Yeup duk better in my opinion...I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place but if you're in the area and craving it...This is a quick way to satisfy your craving"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for dinner. I enjoy tteokbokki but don't often get to eat it because when my friends order it, it is often served in spicy preparations. So when I saw a place that sells non-spicy rice cakes, I knew my friends and I had to come here.

Options for rice cake dishes include Red (gochujang or spicy) sauce, Brown (soy and bulgogi sauce) and White (cream based) sauce. I appreciated having options that are not spicy. The rice cakes were satisfyingly chewy. I enjoyed the soy/bulgogi rice cakes which had a pleasant sweetness to the dish and a decent amount of thinly sliced beef. The cream based dish had bacon and a hot dog on top. I would have appreciated a bit more sauce.The red sauce was not as spicy as other places I've tried, and unlike other places, it lacked substance (as in additional toppings like fish cakes or kimchi) and sauciness that I've come to associate with other tteokbokki preparations. 

Other snacks include popcorn chicken ($6), gimmari (envision fried sushi hand rolls with glass noodles instead of rice)($5), mandu (dumplings)($5), soondae (blood sausage) ($7), and fish cake skewers or fish cake soup. We ordered a fries platter that included mandu, gimmari, and veggie fries. The mandu wrapper was a bit hard for my liking. The veggie fries were more like a veggie fritter and were great for dipping into the different rice cakes sauces. The gimmari was a pleasant surprise as the flavour of crispy seaweed and texture of chewy glass noodles was an unexpectedly tasty combination.

For dessert, they have chocolate, green tea and injeolmi flavoured bingsoo ($8 each). We got the green tea, chocolate and injeolmi bingsu. They were very generous with the roasted soybean powder for the injeolmi bingsu and cocoa powder for the chocolate bingsu but less so when it came to the matcha powder for the green tea bingsu. The bingsu was yummy nonetheless but I would have to say I prefer the overall flavour profile of bingsu I had at the Cups.

Sapporo beer is on tap. There is a second floor but seating is mostly on the main floor. Seating is limited for larger groups, especially during peak hours. Did I mention they have super cute utensils with emotive faces on them? If you enjoy rice cakes, you should try Go Topoki."}
{"text":"Came to try out this new restaurant on a weekend and it did not disappoint :)!

Restaurant is bright and spacious. Walked in a got a table right away.

We ordered one cream toboki and one spicy toboki plus popcorn chicken. Both tastes amazing. However, if ur not a spice lover, I strongly suggest you to not get the spicy toboki because it's way too spicy. I looked at other people and they were all dying from spice at the end.

Definitely will visit again :D"}
{"text":"This is a nice brightly lit restaurant. My friends and I have been eyeing this place for awhile. We ordered a brown bulgogi, red seafood regular spicy, fries platter, 5 fish skewers and the white combo (white bacon, green grape soju, and popcorn chicken). The bulgogi was my favorite, it was sweet and salty. Although my friends said they found it a little salty when they ate too much. The white bacon was creamy and the bacon complimented the sauce well, wasn't too salty. Can't say much about the red seafood because I didn't try it. The popcorn chicken came with 2 sauces, wasabi mayo and Thai chili. In the fries platter, I loved the friend veggies, the dumplings were forgettable, and didn't try the seaweed roll. The fish cake skewers were pretty big for the price. Soup complimented the rice cakes well.

Overall, great staff, pretty delicious food, would come back when I'm craving rice cakes."}
{"text":"Very clean and brightly lit place. Service was somewhat negligent but friendly - I had two girls helping me. One was texting on her phone for 5 minutes before she noticed I had no menu or wafer. I actually had to ask for water as I wasn't given any. Service did get better when her colleague stepped in. The second server was the opposite of the first server - very attentive and filled up my water every time it was half full. The first server came back around again by the time I was ready to pay. It actually took another customer to let her know that I was ready to pay. So...all in all, not terrible service but service as a whole needs to be more attentive. 

The food was pretty good. I got the seafood base rice cakes with rosé sauce and ramen noodles. It was very filling! I also ended up getting the veggie fritters and they were good as well. Since I was starving when I came in, I ended up finishing everything! 

The restaurant also serves shaved ice, which is interesting, considering how it is usually dessert-type restaurants that serve shaved ice. Then again, Go Topoki specializes in serving customized rice cakes so the shaved ice for dessert shouldn't be something that is super surprising. 

Overall, clean, unique place andI really liked the Korean/Italian fusion concept of serving customized rice cakes with pasta sauces."}
{"text":"Amazing Tteok-bokkii ever had so far is my entire life. The service is nice and very kind to you. It is a great place to have a small snack to share with friends. Would recommend this place for sure. Plus it's super cheap to purchase."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant! They have a twigim platter (called the fried platter) here which was my favourite part of tteokbokki as a kid when my grandma made it. Interesting spin on the flavours, something for everyone. 

If you can't handle heat, don't get spicy. If you think you can handle heat, get spicy. Extra spicy is very spicy, I like it, but no one I've ever went with has been able to eat it.

Bingsu is also good! Ice isn't shaved as thin as other places, but flavour and size and toppings are awesome. 

Service is spectacular, not once did we have to ask for our water to be filled. Were not rushed out after we finished our meal. Free odeng soup because the weather was bad (not pictured)! Greeted upon entry and when we left the staff also said thanks!

Great place to go with friends! Highly suggest splitting the twigim if you go with others. Big portions, fairly cheap, always leave full and satisfied (with a charged phone too! They have charging stations, just bring your own cable!)"}
{"text":"Tried this new restaurant just yesterday and it put a smile to my face! Decorated with my favorite color yellow? Check. Tasty food? I am not a cook, don't ask!. Friendly staff? Check. Clean restroom? Double check. Lighting that dims at night? Check. Cute engraved cuttery? Check. Affordable? Check!

The place's MO is effectively serving Topoki in an Italian pasta sauce like Rose Sauce. They also served it with forks and knives instead of chopsticks which adds a bit for sophistication. :)

All in all, I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your rice cake fix! I like that it sticks out from the other korean restos in the area (where it's mostly just spicy rice cake). The portions are pretty good and given that the mains all feature rice cakes, it fills you up fast.

We ordered the seafood option with rose sauce and sausage in white sauce. Also added instant noodles (which was good but not necessary given how fast things get cold). The tricky part was not taking too long to eat, since the rice cake starts to harden and the cream sauce gets less appealing. 

Will have to come back again to try their different sides."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time.  I enjoyed it very much.  The menu wasn't huge so you would have to have this specifically in mind to eat here.  The fast of everything was on point and the prices were reasonable.  Between 4 and 5 o'clock pm not many people, we did not have to wait for a seat.  The veggie prices could have used a mayo sort of dip but that was extra $1 charge.  All in all everything was good and well presented."}
{"text":"I went here alone on a sunday afternoon. (It's kinda awkward for me since I couldn't finished my ordered food)

I got the spicy topoki. I was expecting runny nose/buzzing ears spicy but it was alright. Its a bit sweet and with a hint of spicy. The rice cake is well cooked, the fish cake i find a bit thin and overcooked for my liking.    It's a 3/5 

I ordered the popcorn chicken to go. Its tasty and crunchy. Not dry at all. I don't have much complain for that. 4/5

It's just newly open so the staffs are still getting to get used to run the place.. they're getting a nice work out too because the kitchen is upstairs."}
{"text":"I went with my Korean friend but we were all disappointed with the taste. The rice cake is too soft and the taste of rice cake is not authentic. The side menues we had were too oily and blend. The male server looked new to the job and the female who I think was the manager looked like she doesn't enjoy her job at all. The new side plates they gave us were dirty with oil, and the table had stains. Yes the place and the food look aesthetic, but if you are looking for a place with good food, this is not the place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love tteokbokki and I was so excited when I found out this restaurant opened up in North York!

The atmosphere is casual and they have two floors. It has a modern design with bright furniture. I came here for lunch on a weekend and it was really empty. Other than my table, there was only one other table occupied. 

Service: The service was friendly. The waiters were very attentive and refilled our water frequently. 

Food: The menu had other items in addition to just rice cakes. They have side items that compliment the rice cake sauce. For the rice cakes, you can choose between several types of sauces. Then you can order additional side items to dip into the rice cake sauce. 
 
I opted for the rose sauce since it is a blend of both a cream sauce and the red sauce. I ordered the rose rice cakes with bacon and I added ramen noodles to it. I also wanted some additional items to dip into the rice cakes so I ordered a platter of the fried stuff. The platter of fried stuff came with gimmari, dumplings, and potatoes. The rose rice cakes was nice. The sauce was thick and flavorful. The rice cakes were chewy. There were a lot more sauce compared to the amount of rice cakes given. I think this is their strategy to encourage customers to order side items to dip into the sauce. The fried platter was typical. I was actually very surprised that the fried stuff went well with the rose sauce. Originally I thought it might be weird since I am so used to dipping fried foods in the traditional spicy red sauce. I didn't expect the fried foods to go well with a creamy sauce. 

I absolutely love rice cakes so I will most likely return whenever I want a snack."}
{"text":"I got fried platter, fish cake skewer and popcorn chicken. 

The popcorn chicken does not come with any sauce, it tastes awful and greasy, nothing else. (The same is also true for the deep fried crystal noodle thing included in fried platter). Fish case skewer is soaked a salty soup base and doesn't taste good neither. 

The only thing I enjoyed is the vegetable in the platter, which is crispy and spiced to the right extent."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the early evening for a quick snack before seeing a movie down the street. The restaurant has a cute minimalist interior and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. Ordered the bulgogi topoki with an egg. The portion was quite large with lots of meat and was a nice mix of sweet and savory."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Came here with friends, and the place was decently populated already. First off, I love how customizable everything is, including the spice level options. If you want a kick but not have your tteokbokki uncomfortably hot and spicy, order it with the Rose base sauce. The place is well lit with a nice modern vibe, and the staff were nice, accommodating and friendly. The tteokbokki itself was nice and chewy, just how it should be. The portions are big, so come hungry! I wasn't totally prepared so unfortunately, I couldn't fully finish mine. You won't have much trouble finding the place, it's easy to spot from Yonge Street - a bright yellow sign. Overall, great place to take a friend, date or small group (not large groups). Go Go Topoki! :3"}
{"text":"The Yonge and Finch area is a gold mine when it comes to food! Great restaurants are abundant in this area ,and if you're  craving some Korean food, especially tteokbokki/rice cakes this is one of my favorite places to go.

The place is clean and the interior design is adorable. Oh! The utensils are soooooo cute (they got lil faces on them). 

The staff and service was great even though there was only 1 server on the floor and about 8 people including myself ,and the person I came with were ordering and needing service .

For the food, I got Red Regular Gochujang rice cakes and ordered cheese and ramen (which you have to pay for ) and for drinks we got an Affogato ,which I believe the espresso used to drown the gelato was a Nespresso pod (so if you're a fan of Nespresso there ya go)

Finding a parking spot close by is a bit of a hassle ,especially on hot days but hey a little exercise won't hurt, right? 

Overall, the food and service was great! The flavours hit the spot and the nice atmosphere makes the whole  experience pleasant! 

If you need a charge there's a USB port to connect and juice up your phone behind the seats by the wall :) enjoy the food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"New Korean restaurant in north York neighbourhood. They offers topokki (rice cake) in three kinds sauces, red (spicy), white (creamy), and brown (Korean BBQ sauce). They also have few appetizers, and bingsoo (shaved ice).

We order brown topokki in brown sauce with bulgolgi, with added cheese (for additional $2). The taste is not too spectacular but decent, like other Korean restaurants nearby. But I like the innovation of the restaurant, a good combination of traditional Korean food, snacks, and bingsoo. It has something for everyone. The decoration is very modern and bright, lots of seats. Service is very attentive, and they give you a feedback form to fill out after meal.

I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I love carbs and Korean rice cakes are one of my favourite ways to consume my feel happy carbs! This little restaurant is newly opened and specializes in just that. They dress their toppoki three ways: spicy red sauce with egg, teriyaki sauce with bulgolgi, and creamy white sauce with seafood. I opted for the teriyaki sauce with bulgolgi beef. When my order came, I dived into the rice cakes right away. It was so good, though just a tad bit tough and chewy not the soft and chewy texture. It probably could have used another 30 seconds to make it easier to chew. Beef was good, a bit too sweet and drowning in sauce but flavourful. Overall enjoyed my meal. For $10 plus hat I get my rice cake cravings solved and it tastes better than what I make so that's going to be what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"this place is pretty nice. very clean and minimalistic furniture and atmosphere. The service is very friendly. the thing I absolutely love about this place is the menu. 

LET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. 
I'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. 

Recommendations: 

Popcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.

Bulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. 

Topoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in."}
{"text":"Small selection in food options but glad we shared our plates as one rice cake plate was a bit too heavy for one person. Definitely loved the shaved ice the most with the soy powder and red bean paste! If you end up getting the popcorn chicken, the sauce for $1 extra was worth it. Service was attentive and they let us overstay without any hassle. Cute decor and cutlery and was very clean"}
{"text":"First time I went was to try tteokbokki for the first time. Now I can say it is one of my favourite korean dishes, and I crave it all the time. 

I got the regular red-base sauce tteokbokki the first time with seafood. I chose to make it spicy, but their spice is no joke. I enjoyed it, but if you can't handle spice well, I'd opt for the regular. The second time I came here was on a snowy Friday, and they had a \"snow day special\" where they gave each customer a free skewer of odeng (fish cakes). I ordered the rose base this time and I prefer it over the traditional red base. I added ramen to my dish this time, and although the additional $2 seems to be too much for how much they actually add into the dish, it made the dish even better."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Yonge and Finch! I am a big fan of Korean rice cake dishes, and they serve a variety here. We decided to try: Rose Bacon Rice Cakes ($10), Gimmari ($5 for 6 pieces), and Bulgogi Kimchi Rice with Cheese ($10). The prices are fair, and service was friendly and quick as well. Reviews for each are below. 

Starting with the rice cake... the rose sauce is basically a blend of the red spicy and the cream sauce, which was creamy and just a tiny kick. The rice cakes itself were chewy, and doesn't taste frozen at all. The gimmari is fried japchae wrapped in seaweed. This had a good crunch, and you could dip it into the rice cake sauce. Lastly, the bulgogi rice was amazing - the beef was sweet and tender, and it tasted good when mixed all together.
 
All in all, would I come back? Definitely - love the prices and love the food! I really want to try their brown rice cakes (pretty unique) and fried platter."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars for the food but took off half a star because the ventilation in the restaurant is pretty bad. I am not sure if it's just a temporary issue, but all our clothes smell like grease afterwards. My clothes don't even smell this bad after hot pot or Korean bbq! Our eyes also got really uncomfortable from the smoke.

Now onto the food...I got the Red Regular Topoki with ramen added, in regular spice. My friends got the Red Regular Topoki with cheese and ramen, Spicy, and the Rose Topoki. All the dishes have the right amount of flavours we were looking for. The Rose one sort of reminded me of pasta sauce since it's red sauce with cream. The rice cakes were tender, which was a plus.
The only thing I would recommend is to have more options to add ingredients to the topoki. For example, fried dumplings, sausage, more fish cake...etc. There was only 3 pieces of small fish cake in the topoki I got. I know topoki is supposed to be a snack or street eat in Korea and honestly there's not much else they add to it. But if you are going to serve it in a restaurant as the main dish, that's something to consider.

Overall this did satisfy my cravings and the food was decent. Hope they will have more variations and additional ingredients in the future! Oh, and fixed that ventilation!"}
{"text":"Pretty good topoki and other offerings. My wife and I stopped by and got:
- Gimmari: The seaweed spring roll wrapping was nice and crispy, and the glass noodles inside were really tasty. The side soy sauce was also really good.
- Seafood topoki with rose sauce: The topoki texture was nice (chewy and filling), but the seafood was a bit small (especially the mussels) and the rose sauce tasted fine but wasn't really memorable. Serving size was ok, although they charge $2 for extra cheese and I was hoping for more cheese at that additional cost. 
- Bulgogi kimchi rice with cheese: Not very tasty bulgogi (pretty bland). Kimchi was ok but not a lot. Mainly the dish was a lot of rice.

Overall, would try Gotopoki maybe once if you like topoki. Otherwise, it's fine to pass as it's ok but nothing great."}
{"text":"This place is good place to meet friends because the atmosphere and workers!! When I went there, there were two female workers! They are very polite and their explanation about menus are so simple and good! 

We tried Seafood Topoki with Rose sauce. It was very good. I'm not good at eating spicy food, so I was afraid of that but it was not very spicy! 

It was creamy and a little bit spicy! Also it has a lot of mussels, squids and shrimps so I was really happy! 

After finish to eat Topoki, we ordered desert! It is called BINGSOO&ICE CREAM? I'm not sure but there are 6 tastes! We tried INJEOLMI! I think it's a regular flavor! It's too sweet for me because I'm terrible at eating sweets! Even if I don't like sweets, it was very tasty!!! 

I thought here is a cozy place and all meals are reasonable. I wanna come back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are craving some ddukbokki and wanna share food with a group of friends. The food here is okay but not amazing and worth travelling here in my option. Also their bingsoo is a little too Icy. Definitely don't get the matcha one, the injeolmi one is ok"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

Located on yonge street just outside of the Northtown plaza, this is a cute new restaurant with some cool takes on Korean snack foods.

We were warmly greeted at the door and seated. The place is really bright and cute but the booths aren't too comfortable, I probably wouldn't want to spend more than an hour or so sitting around. They can maybe invest in some cushions for the chairs, but no big deal! 

We ordered the rosé topoki  with bacon and it was definitely the highlight of the meal. The rice cakes were chewy and satisfying and the sauce was really good, I wasn't sure whether to expect an Italian inspired sauce or something more Korean and surprisingly, it was both. This sauce is a mix of their original sauce and some cream so it was a bit tangy but also creamy. I really liked this and thought it was clever to incorporate these flavours together. We also ordered the popcorn chicken and the fried platter. Both were good but not as memorable. I'd maybe stick to the topoki or try one of the rice or noodle bowls. Looking around, the seafood options looked amazing so I'd opt for one of those next time.

The portion sizes were good for the price, $10-13 for the topoki, depending on the toppings and these things are filling. We shared one and had two appetizers and had a good amount of food. For dessert they also have a few options of bingsoo, we tried the chocolate which was amazing, this was my first time trying this dessert and I loved it, I can imagine myself eating these all the time in the summertime, they're refreshing rather than rich or heavy which was great! 

The service was really genuine and nice. Our food arrived quickly and water was refilled regularly without having to ask for it. No complaints for service, I just feel bad that their kitchen is upstairs and they have to run up and down to get food, etc... but they seem to be in good spirits.

Overall, I'd definitely come back here to get my topoki fix. I'm already thinking about the seafood topoki and which sauce I'd like to try next!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few months back and only got to reviewing it now. 
It has very cute utensil set. The topoki tasted pretty good, and the fried platter was okay. The rice cakes tasted on par with other Korean restaurants. We got the cheese topoki. 
This place is good for a casual hangout."}
{"text":"Love the vibe on this place! The waiters are really nice and friendly too and the food is delish. You get just the right portion which is worth the $$ you pay for. We had the bulgogi topoki and seafood cream sauce base topoki and popcorn chicken. White topoki is hands down the best dish for me but if you like something sweet go for the bulgogi. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Yet another reason for me to come back to the Yonge and Finch area... I LOVE korean food - especially rice cakes so when I saw this on blogto I knew I had to go! 

I came on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy (probably due to the horrible weather that night) so the wait for a table wasn't long at all. There are two floors, but the place is still pretty small so I can imagine that there'd be a bit of a wait when it does get busy. The decor is really simple yet modern - perfect place for a casual bite with your friends. 

I ordered the bacon and sausage rose sauce rice cakes with cheese and ramen noodles. I wish I didn't order the cheese add-on though because it was way too cheesy and over powered the sauce. It was still good though, next time I'll just pass on the cheese. It doesn't look like they're very big portions but it is very filling! I believe mine came up to $14 after the add-ons which is ehh average price! 

My friend got the bulgogi brown sauce rose sauce. It is sooo watery .. and a bit salty for our taste! But despite that my friend still enjoyed it. I believe hers was only $10..   She also asked for spicy and had a bit of a hard time finishing it because of the spice LOL so if you can't handle your spices too well be careful when ordering spicy! 

My boyfriend got the kimchi rice for $10. I didn't get to try it but he said it was really good and devoured it within minutes. Again, the portion doesn't look huge nor worth the price but it still filled him up. 

We also tried the fish skewers! It was huge and this is definitely the one dish where I say the portion is so much more than the price! $5 for 3 huge skewers is a steal. It was good but I wish it was in a spicier sauce or something other than just clear broth because it was a little plain. I just dipped it in my rice cake sauce so it was an easy fix! 

Oh, lastly we also ordered the dumplings which .. weren't the very best! It was ok but we had better else where and that fact was super evident. It was crispy, I'll give it that but something about the filling we didn't really enjoy. 

Service was also very good - our server was very bright, cheerful and adorable! She checked up on us often - not to the point where we were annoyed but enough where we were comfortable and had everything we needed. 

I definitely recommend trying Go Topoki if you're in the area or even if you're craving rice cakes! I'll be returning very soon to try out the other sauces. This place is super unique with the customization options for rice cakes, and with superb service - I have really high hopes for this place :)"}
{"text":"Modern and casual place serving yummy topoki!

We had a craving for Korean food and wanted to try something a bit different from the usual BBQ and noodles. Topoki is a traditional Korean dish of thick rice noodles served in sauce and toppings. We popped in on Sunday morning and ended up being their first customers at noon.

Inside, the restaurant has two floors and it sports a bright and airy feel with modern decor. The servers were very nice and gave us some feedback on the different sauces. We ordered the veggie fritters and the rose sauce - one with seafood and one with bacon.

The food didn't take too long to come out and we were pleasantly surprised by the big bowls of rose sauce with lots of rice noodles swimming in it. My bacon one also had a hotdog on top of it. As I scooped up some noodles, bacon and onions, it tasted great - nice creamy taste combined with a kick of heat at the end. Bacon and onion were nice touches to it. But, I think the winner here is the seafood one - lots of mussels, shrimp and squid! The sauce went quite well with seafood - definitely worth the extra 3 dollars! The only medicore item was the veggie fritters - we we're hoping for more veggie tempura - we got a generous portion but it could have used a bit more salt. I ended up dipping them in to the rose sauce - that kinda tells you how much I liked the sauce. Overall, the topoki was great and we'll be back to try the others!"}
{"text":"There was enough seating available for us. Very clean and a nice atmosphere. We got an order of Rose topoki with cheese, and kimchi bulgogi. The food tasted great. The prices seemed to be reasonable. I forgot to ask for a higher spice amount, so it would have been nice if the waiter  confirmed what spicy level I wanted."}
{"text":"As an avid fan of Korean food, I was thrilled to see what this Korean street food joint had to offer. Go Topoki is located in the heart of Yonge and Finch, a very accessible place that is surrounded by variety of other restaurants you can head too if you are feeling something else.

The menu has a good amount of dishes that are rice/fish cake based. The serving for each dish is also a lot so you can get multiple things and share them amongst your friends. We ordered the seafood topoki, the regular red topoki and fish cakes in broth, all of them were super yummy and the topoki was deliciously chewy. 

The service was very attentive and polite, and the restaurant itself is very clean and neatly set up. I also like the aesthetic of the place itself (specially the cute faces they have on their spoons and forks)."}
{"text":"Came here for soft opening special.   

ordered the bulgogi dish and original rice cakes (red sauce with fishcake).   Although we ordered mild original flavor (gochujang)..  it was sooooo damn spicy.  i can handle spice but that was definitely not mild sauce.  It was comparable with suicide wings.  also, picture had green onions but mine didnt have any.  Just came out red.  

anyways, in terms of the food.  It may not look like a lot but it can fill you.  Pure Carb Gluttony!

The setting is modern but definitely did not feel like a warm and welcoming restaurant to me.  Felt very art gallerish  if that makes sense.  Food is prepared upstairs and brought down the stairs which seemed like potential hazard in the future (Murphys Law).

the dishes did not come with enough meat.  Which i found myself having guilt for eating so much chewy rice cakes. (Texture was very nice though)

I do give them points for packaging up the food very nicely in sealed microwave dinner looking packs.  Packaging and everything is nice.  But IMO, it needs work.   probably wont return.   

But one of the staff did ask for my feed back at the end of my meal which was very nice of him to do.  He was very polite and seemed to want the restaurant to succeed.  Hope they do.  Good luck."}
{"text":"We ordered the rose rice cakes with seafood and the cream sauce with bacon and sausage. We also got a side order of fried chicken.
Our favourite was the rose sauce, we got it slightly spicy and it was perfect- enjoyable yet it had a slight kick. We loved the sauce so much we dipped our fried chicken into it! 
For the cream sauce, we found the rice cake a little over cooked, not as chewy as the rose sauce ones. We also added ramen to the cream sauce which was really nice."}
{"text":"Disclosure: never has topoki before. Didn't even know it was a thing 

Came here on a whim, because the bakery that I wanted to go to was closed. 

The restaurant has two floors and the decor is really cute. They have little characters in the utensils! 

The staff was really nice and didn't rush us at all when we were settling in and warming ourselves up. 

My SO and I shared one plate of Topoki, since we weren't very hungry (we went to One Ten café and Mr. Chu before this. See other reviews). Their topoki comes with a free drink during lunch. 

We got the mildly spicy rosé sauce with bacon and hot apple cider. The cider was delicious. Very good choice! 

The topoki came quickly and the waiter also brought two plates so that we could share. I've never had it before, so I don't know if it tastes authentic, but wow. I thought it was incredible! The sauce was to die for! So creamy, but not oily and so flavourful. The little cylinders has a kind of sticky texture. Very good! 

The plate was more than enough for two. 

All the other customers that came in while we were eating were all Korean people, so maybe it's a sign that it tastes authentic? 

We sat there for the longest time after we finished eating. Our plates were already taken away and we were just chatting, but we were never pressured to leave. They didn't even bring the bill! They just let us enjoy the place and talk. I got a great vibe from this place! 

10/10 would return!"}
{"text":"Spicy ALERT! If you have a low tolerance for spiciness (like me), consider yourself warned! Best make your order mild spicy!

Go Topoki is a unique cafe/restaurant hybrid that offers lattes and bingsu desserts as well as the signature topoki dishes and alcohol (beer and soju). 

I'd highly recommend ordering the rose topoki with fresh mussels. It's a delicious balance of spicy and creamy sauce with the soft chewiness of the topoki. However, if you're ordering the red topoki, then have it mild! It was already super spicy for me. So if you're feeling dangerous, there's two higher spiciness levels to choose from."}
{"text":"A downside to this location is parking. Either street parking or there's several spots in the midst of the condos. However, I must warn you that parking there is much more expensive than street parking. I can't remember if it was $1 or $2 per 15 minutes, yikes! 

I had gone after the lunch rush and it wasn't too busy. We ordered spicy tteokbokki, bulgogi kimchi rice, and udon noodle in soup. I regret ordering spicy, I should've gone with regular. My tongue was on fire. The bulgogi kimchi rice was delicious but the portion seemed a bit small."}
{"text":"This place is good for a one-time only restaurant if you just want to try something relatively new. Came here for its rice cakes and it was decent but nothing too special. We got the bacon topoki with rosé sauce and added glass noodles as an extra. We also tried the fish cakes and bulgogi kimchi rice with cheese. I thought the rice was pretty good but the fish cake could've been softer as I found it to be a bit hard. The prices of these are not bad either, but to be honest I'd rather get similar items at the food truck stand in front of Shoppers for a fraction of the price instead. The decor of the place is really nice though and the servers were attentive. It has a cute yellow/grey colour scheme and the utensils have little smiley faces on them! :)"}
