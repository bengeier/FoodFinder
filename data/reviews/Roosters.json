{"text":"We used to eat their every week till the service went south.

Really bad service, slow and not polite.

Wings became smaller, price went up, it sucks.

I still love their nachos, but with the bad service, I will rather not eat their anymore."}

To whom it may concern:

This was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in over a decade! We ordered food to go on mother's day. Excited that we could provide my wife's parents with Rooster, we order from the Biddulph Rd. location. 

First, the food was the worst Roosters I have ever had, tasted, or even looked at! The wings were bone dry, looked extremely strange, and tasted nothing like Roosters wings. Being from Columbus, Ohio we eat at Roosters at least once a week, and know what good wings taste like. 

Excited about Roosters wings the in-laws were so happy. Much to their and our dismay the food was as mentioned above awful. We contacted the location to discuss the complete disaster we paid $37 for. Upon asking for a manager we were told they were busy and they would call us back. After the food had sat uneaten on the table for hours we never received a call. Finally we called back and spoke to another girl on the phone, again the manager was \"busy\" and the girl was authorized to issue us a gift card. 

Although the gift card was a good gesture, the food and services had already left an extremely bad taste in our mouths. Now they are going to mail us a gift card the next day Monday. One week goes by, no card. The next week goes by, no card. We call and ask, guess what, the manager is \"busy\". Finally after several attempts a women informed us that our gift card was on the back desk and had not been mailed; weeks after the promised Monday mailing. Oh and guess what that was not the manager we spoke to, that manager was again \"busy\".

If you would like Roosters stick to the Columbus Locations!"}

{"text":"The best time to hit up Roosters for wings is during the day. If you go during an event like a Cavs or Browns game, the service may be kind of slow. Otherwise, the service is great. 

I have only had one bad experience at Roosters with bad service and the manager corrected the situation and made it better for my family. 

I like my wings hot, but try the garlic wings too. They're great."}
