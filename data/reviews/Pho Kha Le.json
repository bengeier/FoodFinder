{"text":"We shared a great tasty order of salad rolls and my wife and daughter had outstanding Bun. I had the sate seafood soup that was excellent. Lots of seafood ,outstanding broth and great portions.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"It's on the pricy side given how much meat was in the bowl (definitely not much). The soup base is on the sweet side. Service is slow. I would much rather drive down to the one on 17th ave and 37st"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now and it's a little gem in a corner of a small strip mall you'd never know was there if you weren't told.  Even the residents of the area don't always know this place exists but it is worth hunting down.  We go there a lot now because a lot of their tastiest dishes can be done without any wheat in them and we can stuff ourselves silly within the 1hr time limit D has for lunch breaks.  D discovered this place some time ago but only recently did I have a chance to try it with him.   I've gone as often as possible just because it's so good.  My favourite so far is the #33 Beef (or chicken) with Mixed Veg & Vermicelli in Spicy Curry Soup.  The flavours remind me of a favourite thai curry that I used to have back in Vancouver, with coconut milk and lemongrass, just nice rich broth so full of flavour you can't stop eating it.  The bits of broccoli holds the broth really well and i always get it with beef which is so tender there it's amazing.  The noodles are easy to manage and it's just super delicious.  I've also had the #34 Kha Le's Special Vermicelli which has really tender pork, the juicy strips of beef I like so much, chicken that was just right, delicious seasoned tiger prawns, and of course my favourite spring rolls.  If you're not sure what to have this one is a good one because it lets you try a little of everything.  I like my orders with a side of their gluten free spring rolls made with rice paper (technically they're actually the traditional version but they serve the westernized/chinese style with the standard wrapper as their regular version and you have to ask for the gluten free ones specifically).  Those spring rolls are so good I always get one or two as an add-on if they don't automatically come with a dish.  One of these days I need to try their deep fried bananas and bubble tea but I'll get around to that maybe on another trip when I don't stuff myself so much with tasty food that it hurts.  The restaurant is always clean when we're there and it's run by a husband/wife duo where he runs the shop with a chatty and pleasant demeanour, and she cooks the crazy-good food.  If you're in the Signal Hill area, or live nearby and haven't tried this place it's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Am so happy that  I've found this little gem in my own neighbourhood. Service is always great and the food is awesome (#34 or 33 are favs of ours!). Went there for supper with a small group of friends and ended up staying for almost 3 hours and made to feel welcome the whole time. I must remember to ask about the \"special\" menu next time  I'm in... :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Still steaming hot when I got it home. Fresh rolls are smaller than other places, but very fresh and great tasting. Minor adjustments to my order were well accommodated."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch,  this is the best one in the aria. I stared work over in west hills and need a good place for lunch. I have gone to the 3 pho places in the aria and I like this one the best for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"I've been to this little Vietnamese place a couple times now.  I've purchased their Vietnamese subs a couple times .  The first time we enjoyed them but the second time, I ordered several subs to go ...  I was very disappointed when our family ate them for dinner .  Not sure if they were running low on their chicken portions, but we found the subs consisted of hardly any meat and very little filling and tasted mostly of toasted bun.    I would have changed my order to beef if chicken was not available ... I try to support small family business but will only return if the food is good. The bubble tea I have had several times was icy and not smooth as some places... Sorry, but I was really disappointed and won't come back..."}
