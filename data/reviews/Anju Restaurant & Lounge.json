{"text":"Amazing food and service. Had the tasting menu, everything came FAST! And it came tasty. First dish came out in minutes, the sauce on the wings was immaculate. 

Server was cute bubbly and on point. Even had to let her know the great job she did. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting more from Anju. I was seated upstairs and didn't feel like the room was comfortable and decorated completely (just felt incomplete somehow) The bathroom was 2 large flights of stairs away, I had to order 50% of my drinks at the bar from the bar tender because our waitress wasn't around. Don't get me wrong the waitresses seemed very nice but it was often hard to find one.
The food on the other hand was amazing, loved everything. Whether or not I would go back I am kind of conflicted. If you went in with the expectations (for service/ambiance etc) that you have for a nice-ish pub you would be pleasantly surprised. But for the price and quality (!) of the food they are serving I feel like a little better than \"pub expectations\" are warranted."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Anju after reading all the positive reviews. We ordered the sardines, beet salad, kimchi, brussel sprouts, chicken wings and sliders. Both the chicken wings and brussel sprouts dishes were so overly sweet and one note. The beet sald was bland and not memorable. The sliders were tasty but nothing that I would rave about. Cute atmosphere but the food was sub par."}
{"text":"Yummy yammy fries !   People were right. How do they get them so crunchy??  I love yam fries, but these are definitely the best that I have ever had.  Mmmm...  and the dipping sauce was yummy too.  I have to say that I was a skeptic about fusion... fusion anything is not my favorite type of cuisine.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed all our dishes.  Tapas style is always fun, as I love sampling many dishes.  My hubby is a much tough critic than I, and he wants to go back already!"}
{"text":"This house-cum-storefront has been home to several restaurants, but I think Anju is finally the right fit.  The menu is comprised mostly of smallish plates of highly seasoned morsels for sharing with close friends or a date, which matches the cozy yet modern atmosphere.  I say close friends because you'll inevitably want to order several rounds of dishes, and poach more or less from any given one, which makes splitting the bill evenly pretty much the only fair option (or getting someone else to pay :)).  This is not the spot to have a one-main dish dinner.

With regards to the food, there is definitely some Korean influence to the palate used, but I would not characterize this as an Asian restaurant per se.  In fact, the only disappointing dish was the thoroughly Korean bibimbap (hot stone rice bowl), which wasn't hot enough to give a crispy texture to the rice in contact with the bowl, and was also a bit underwhelming flavour-wise.  I don't meant to sound as if I didn't like Anju, on the contrary I'm pretty miserly with my stars and this is a solid four!  Now that we've got the limitations out of the way, on to the good stuff:

- The yam fries are super crispy and accompanied by a nicely spicy sauce.  The portion is sizeable, so this is a good item to order right away and graze on as the other dishes come out haphazardly.

- Pork belly is available as the \"protein\" in several dishes....mmmmm.  We did this for the lettuce wraps, which were fun to assemble.  We also added pork belly to the excellent panko-crusted fried tofu dish, for good measure.

- The ox tail tortellini packs a good punch, especially with the very pungent accompanying soy sauce

- The calamari was decent (this was someone else's choice).  

There were definitely others I'll have to come back and try, like the \"chicken and waffles\".  The menu was recently updated, but is not yet on the Web site...I'm not sure how often they switch things up. Regardless, this is the kind of place where you could keep going back for favorites, but throw in some variety each time as well.

On the drink front, they do have a half dozen or so original cocktails, and a page devoted to Sochu (a strong rice wine) which can be plain or herbaceous, and flavoured with various fruit juices.  The service was very attentive, yet unobtrusive, while the small venue makes the place lively (I'd recommend reservations on the weekend) but dinner-conversation quiet at the same time. With 2-3 dishes each, drinks, tax and tip, you're probably looking at about $50 per person for a very enjoyable three hour soiree."}
{"text":"Wow. This. Was. An. Amazing. Dinner
My sister and I actually tried to go here on Family Day (along with about 4 other restaurants that were closed) and it was closed. I happened to be looking at apartments in the area one Saturday and saw the building and decided that would be the night we tried it.
There were three of us for dinner and we were all starved. 
Our server, Keigen (sorry if I am totally butchering the spelling) greeted us with some waters and then introduced the specials; Asparagus and Winnipeg Lake Pickerel. Both sounding amazing. He also introduced us to Soju.
Now let me tell you, for all of those who have never had Soju, this is some strong stuff. But so so tasty. They have a bunch of choices of flavors, we went for the recommendation from Kiegen, Aloe. Essentially this is Korean moonshine. At 19 or so % it has a kick to it, but you don't taste it. There is a slight after taste of vodka, but you can sip it like soda. Dangerous. The three of us easily polished off one jug.
The first thing we tried was the edamame, which tied us over and was delicious! The next thing we ordered was the yam fries. Proclaimed as the best in Calgary, we had to try them, and they were fabulous. Covered in rice flour and truffle oil - so yummy! 
We also shared the chicken wraps and asked him to surprise us with a dish. As my sister and I don't eat pork he brought us the Kimchi rice which was just soooo good.
I would go into more detail on the food, but we just ate it so quickly that I can't even tell you specifics, except that we were all very very very impressed.
During our dinner, the table next to us had a dessert and it looked so good we asked for one as well. It was pear wrapped in deep friend pastry with ice cream. It was literally gone in a few minutes.
I loved this restaurant. The service was just impeccable. We all agreed it was some of the best treatment we had received in a very very long time. He was friendly, helpful, funny, had amazing personality and just made our experience at Anju that much better.  
I would HIGHLY recommend Anju to anyone who wants to try something a little different. I didn't go upstairs, but I think it caters to larger groups and this is something that I would want to take advantage of in the near future.
My only last comment is, Be careful when pouring the soju, the hole where the ice is leaks! (go figure) my iPhone discovered that on accident!"}
{"text":"Have been to Anju a couple times and the food is consistently good. The food is a surprisingly well though out and tasty. Usually I get sick at the thought of fusion. I have just seen it butchered too many times. Not at Anju, the chef has both talent and the creativity sufficient to make fusion more than a buzz work for expensive ethnic food. 

If you are booking in advance for 4-6 people, get the bo ssam party order, it is amazing. It is a pork shoulder, oyster & kimchi lettuce wrap. The pork is slow roasted and its unbelievable. 

Other than that, the sweet potato fries are really good and the roasted asian pear pie is different and delicious. 

If it is more of a party night, try the yogurt soju (korean sake highball mix). It is easy to drink, carries a punch and comes in a very neat holder that keeps the ice from diluting the drink. My personal favorites are the aloe and orange juice mixes. 

Have a great time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I tried this place thanks to my friend's recommendation (she used to be a server there) and we - me and three of my coworkers - loved everything we tried.  Grilled cheese sammies with pulled pork and kimchi, ox tail pasta, steaks, etc etc. I took my boyfriend there 3 months later and I almost cried when they said they didn't make grilled cheese sammie anymore. Even my boyfriend, who was still on the fence about Korean food, loved the food at Anju. The place was packed on Friday @ 10pm - so the service wasn't the \"best,\" but overall, we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Just visiting in town, but I ordered the pork \"fajitas\" which were excellent with seaweed instead of a tortilla, I also ordered the yam fries which are pretty amazing, the sauce that comes with them is delicious.  If I ever come back to the Great North I will definitely make a visit to this place"}
{"text":"Anju Restaurant & Lounge - Korean Fusion

Reservation: Yes

It opened in January, so not too long ago.  This place use to be Rouge, but the owner sold it to a Chinese couple I believe.  David and I went for a Valentine's Day Dinner, so it was set, we have yet to try the regular menu they offer.  That night, the set dinner was $60 per person and then if you would like to add wine pairing onto the food, it's $60 per person.  So its $120 per person that night (I thought it was pretty expensive).  But I guess it's reasonable cause it's holiday and it was a 5 course meal.

The decor in the restaurant was really calm and relaxing, it's really dark, I liked it.  The food was amazing, it was really good.  The wine pairing was all really similar for each course.  For appetizer, David had a Kim chi marinated salmon, and I had a bean sprout soup.  Paired with 2 white wine.  I can't remember what was the other thing we had, but for the main course, David had the steak and I had a stuffed crab.  The size of the steak was reasonable, but I prefer the crab over the steak.  The crab had portobelle mushrooms and cheese on top of it.  Mmmm mmm goooood!!  We then had cheese and crackers, i love cheese...paired with red wine.  Lately, we had dessert, one of them was champagne with ice cream I believe, I didn't like that too much...
As for the other, it was something similar to apple dumpling with ice cream on top.  It tastes really good, the apples aren't sour or too sweet, the puff pastry wasn't soggy.  David and I didn't finish the dessert cause we were too full. 

Dinner that night was so good!  I would definitely go back to it!!  We can't wait to try the regular menu at Anju.  However, the parking is pretty hectic.

{"text":"Went for the Valentines pre-set menu. 

The atmosphere is really romantic! and the service was perfection.

The meals were really good - delicious Oysters and pork rolls - but the Chicken and Waffles dish was disappointing dish as it was too spicy, not good cuts of meat, and had an overall strange flavour mix.

The dessert was a spicy chocolate mousse and we loved it but couldn't eat it all as it was a tad too spicy as well. And we are not usually shy to spicy foods!

We will be coming back to try other food items!! Great overall experience :)"}
{"text":"Funky place, nice people, good food. A Fun unique fusion of Asian/ North American Cuisine."}
{"text":"Have been here once before a while ago and can't remember what I had but I was quite impressed with the food, so I headed back this week with my partner to use our WagJag coupon.

The decor of the place is very modern and sleek.  Music was pumping from upstairs when we walked in the front door and we were given the option of any table on the lower floor.  After choosing a table by the wall, my partner commented that the music was a little loud (speaker is mounted on the wall) and wondered if we could ask for it to be turned down.  We didn't and he forgot about it after awhile but a group of 4 who came in after and sat next to us eventually changed tables because they thought the music was too loud.  Just a note.

We ordered the grilled eggplant and beef tataki to start.  Both dishes were delicious although the tataki was really small for it's price.  For our mains, we ordered the lettuce wrap with pork belly, crispy tofu and kimchi ramen.  I enjoyed all three mains as well.  The lettuce wrap was a little small and we had to order the crispy tofu to supplement what was a 'big plate' but it was tasty and I enjoyed putting my wrap together.  The kimchi ramen is highly recommended.  It was not too spicy, comes with a bowl of rice and the noodles are unique (not something I have had before).  My partner particularly enjoyed the crispy tofu which came with citrus aioli that balanced out the spiciness of the kimchi.

If you're a fan of kimchi, I also recommend their kimchi caesar cocktail which comes with soju instead of vodka.  The clamato and kimchi complements each other and I liked the bits of cabbage in the drink.  Kinda replaces a pickled asparagus/bean!

Service was excellent.  Our server was really courteous and friendly, something that seems to be rare in Calgary nowadays.  Food can take a little while to reach your table from their fairly small kitchen.

I do think a meal here can get quite pricey if you order a few items that are smaller in portions and I wouldn't recommend this place for a big group but I would definitely head back when I'm in the mood for some Korean fusion food."}
{"text":"First of it's kind in Calgary - Korean Fusion

Luckily Anju is within a 5 minute walking distance for me. 

I've tried many traditional korean cuisine but Roy's is traditional with a twist. Even my korean fiance loves the food.

The menu has changed many times since its opened and i love that about Roy, He is constantly improving his menu based on his customers' suggestions and feedback. 

I introduced my co-workers to Anju and they loveee it! They go back for drinks and tapas after work (without me LOL)

There are many tapas that you can try out with your friends, Crispy Tofu with Sauteed Kimchi, Truffled Yam Fries with Garlic Aioli sauce, Chicken Wings(Gochujang and Spicy Serrano Sauce is my fave) and Asian Pear salad. And then throw in some sides like rice, tofu, kim chi, daikon. Sometimes they have drink specials which goes great with the tapas. AWESOMENESS!

I have to admit i don't go there often but when i do it's special. 

As well nice atmosphere and good music. The music isn't too loud which is good because i'm not there to dance, but rather enjoy the atmosphere, have a nice conversation with friends over delicious food. 

I'm sure it's family friendly but i would recommend for couples, small parties and special occasions."}
{"text":"There was a group of us that had went there for a party. Now the the food was good, but unfortunately that is if you get it. Many of the items ordered were not available, but most of the time we only found out they ran out much later. 

Drink orders took a good 20-30 minutes to come, and some dishes just did not arrive period.

I think they definitely not somewhere I would go back to. At least not for awhile till they fix their slow service, and kitchen issues."}
{"text":"Arrived late, taster menu was outstanding! Service rocked! Kimchi Ceaser was to die for. In fact best Kimchi I 've eve eaten. Try the tofu with citrus ailioli!"}
{"text":"Anju is a tucked-away little hole-in-the-wall-but-cleaner type place that has a chef that I believe fell from heaven (or someplace close). 

The owners of Anju long ago learned that going out for dinner is just as much about discovering as it is about eating. The food here is wonderful, but the overall experience of eating at this restaurant is really where Anju shines. 

My experience is thus: I was part of a party of 12 recently at Anju. Upon arrival I learned that Anju sets menus for parties of that size and that we were not going to know what we were getting until it came out. Our dinner felt like an event rather than just, well, dinner. Everything was well planned and nicely executed; appetizers, mains, dessert; even drinks were pre-set by the chef for us. They took only food preferences or allergies on reservation, the rest was up to them.

We were treated to a wide variety of Korean-meets-amazing dishes, giving us an excellent feel for the overall style of the menu. I was impressed by the attention to detail Anju put into it's menu planning for our party, everything was well-balanced; something I expect from Asian cuisine but was delighted to find in fusion food. We had one vegan in our group and her meal was as considered as the rest, which was a refreshing change from the \"oh just eat this I guess\" approach of some establishments.

A restaurant that understands the importance of the experience for the guests as well as the flavor of it's menu gets an A+ in my food diary. So if you are looking for a fun and slightly adventurous food opportunity for a large party; seriously consider Anju because they will be seriously considerate of you.

T."}
{"text":"A last minute dinner and a movie date was a great opportunity to visit Anju again. I attended a Yelp event there a while back & have wanted to go back ever since. 

Since we weren't terribly hungry, we tried a few appetizers. We ordered kimchi, the sable fish and the tofu. All were delicious but the tofu was the stand out. You MUST order it. It is divine! The sablefish was also delicious though a late warning about bones (after we had cut it up) left us eating carefully and hoping for the best.

Anju is definitely on my \"must return\" list. I just wish they were open for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Calgary!

My favorite way to enjoy Anju is to get a couple of people together and order a lot of the small plates. Crispy tofu, lettuce wraps etc. The kimchi ramen is also amazing..it's hard to find good ramen in YYC. Whenever I have friends visiting from out of town we head to Anju to share some good food and work our way through the cocktail menu. 

Favorites on the menu:
crispy tofu 
Korean chicken wings
Pork belly steamed buns (so good I once ordered them for dessert after we were done eating)
black sesame creme brulee"}
{"text":"Anju is EXCEPTIONAL. The ambiance, the food and the service are absolutely top notch.

I was initially intrigued by Anju because it is a restaurant located in a converted house downtown Calgary. The restaurant itself is divided into two sections: a downstairs Korean dining room and an upstairs lounge.

Considering I am ridiculously particular about what I ingest, I went in thinking I wouldn't have a whole lot of 'healthy' options to choose from. I was VERY pleasantly surprised to find that pretty much EVERYTHING on their menu is extremely healthy and fresh. This place is definitely food friendly for anyone on a specific health regiment. This place makes my heart happy because it gives people who have dietary restrictions a place to go to eat out! 

The prices were extremely reasonable and the staff couldn't have been more professional and accommodating. I was VERY impressed.

One note however: this place can be VERY hard to actually get in to. I tried 3 times before I was able to make reservations. The first couple of times they were closed to the public as they were hosting special functions, and the third time they were packed until close. I wish it wasn't so hard to make reservations here... I honestly had almost given up trying! I'm glad I didn't, but this place needs to find a better system of getting everyone who wants in, in!"}
{"text":"A huge group of us recently came back to Anju for a going-away dinner for a fellow Yelper. From the very first line of communication, the staff at Anju has been SUPERSTARS.

Allow me to explain. When we called to reserve for a group of 17 people, I spoke to a waitress and tentatively booked with her. Then the next day when things were confirmed, I tweeted to Anju (that's right, they are very active on social media!) asking when I can call them about my reservation, since they only opened at 5pm, and it was noon then. A few hours later, Roy calls me directly and informs me about the $35 per person tasting menu for groups of this size. That's fine by me, I thought, and then proceeded to tell him that 2 of us diners will be vegan. And I don't really eat pork. Roy fumbled a little, which made me feel guilty for being so demanding, but then he said \"Okay, I will put together a menu for your group\". I was quite impressed with this entire exchange. From him caring enough to give me a call back, to him deciding to put together a menu just for us and our dietary restrictions.

Anyway, we arrived that night, and our server was Keegan (I apologize if I spelled this incorrectly!). Keegan was lively, helpful and incredibly engaging! He never let our soju glasses go empty, and never allowed a dull moment. Seriously one of the best waiters I have had the chance to encounter in Calgary!

On to the food: the chicken wings were delicious, thick and juicy, (in fact, a few of us thought we should make Anju our regular wing night place!), the truffle fries were phenomenal, the oysters were FRESH, the crispy tofu was OUT of this WORLD. Oh my... I was in foodie heaven. In between us downing our shots of delightful soju (we had the aloe, mango, lychee and passionfruit flavours), and the delicious food being brought to our tables, course after course, I felt SPOILED! Yes Anju, that is how you made me feel. For our main course, we had lettuce wraps with rice and 3 kinds of meat: beef, pork and chicken. Once again, scrumptious. While all this was happening, my vegan dining partner on my right was being brought her OWN little vegan menu too, so she was also being taken care of. And I was so happy to see that there was only one pork item on the menu, Roy actually took my preferences to heart! For dessert, we were brought cute little flavoured popsicles - also delicious. By then, we were all so full!

Honestly, I cannot find one flaw with this place. High quality creative cuisine, generous portions, AMAZING service, soju (ohh the soju!)... Anju is PHENOMENAL. Chef Roy is a genius, plain and simple. If you have not been yet, you are seriously missing out.

I am so happy a place like Anju exists in Calgary. In fact, it might just be my new favourite restaurant. I would give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Recently, I traveled far, far away to... Calgary, Canada and found a Korean \"tapas\" restaurant called Anju.  Okay, fine... I didn't find it... my boyfriend did, but who's keeping score!  Anyways, we ventured over here because my boyfriend had heard good things about this place from his coworkers.  To be honest, I was somewhat skeptical because the food there (in Calgary) wasn't that great.  However, I have to admit that this was the first place I've eaten there that made me happy and satisfied. 

Since this place is a \"tapas\" place, we ordered a few items.  First off, we had the AAA Short Ribs with Sweet Soy Marinade and Potato.  This dish was DELISH!  The short ribs were marinaded in this heavenly sauce and it was very flavorful.  The potatoes that came with this dish was cooked perfectly as well.  

However, the potatoes that came with the short ribs were in no comparison to their Truffle Yam Fries with Gochugaru Sauce Aioli.  OMG!  The sauce was AMAZING! (and spicy).  The fried sweet potatoes were simply the best I'd ever had!  This place was not kidding when they say they have the best sweet potato fries!  ::sigh:: yes... I'm craving for them now....

We also ordered their Chicken Stone Bowl.  Basically this is a rice dish topped with diced chicken, red bell peppers, soy beans, zucchini, and a lightly poached egg.  The bowl was really made of stone and I believe the rice was cooked in it.  The stone bowl was crazy hot (so be careful!). I didn't like the fact that the server failed to mention how hot the dish was, so it was a joy when I tried to move the bowl.  The idea of this dish... you mix together all the toppings with the egg and the egg gets cooked while its being mixed.  It also comes with a side of chili paste.  We used more than half that container (and it was a BIG container) and the dish still wasn't spicy.  I'd have to say that this isn't a dish you'd want to try here  because it wasn't that great.  My boyfriend wasn't impressed with it (and he LOVES rice).  Honestly, I've had better rice stone bowls from the Korean market in Houston (and its way cheaper there as well- I'll yelp about it soon, no worries!). 

We also ordered their Seasonal Vegetable, which was bok choy.  It was cooked with kimchi and fermented tofu paste (I know it doesn't sound good, but it was).  I'd have to say I enjoyed the veggie more than the rice bowl. 

Now, when you go to Canada, you must try their Caesar!  It's basically a Bloody Mary but made with clamata juice instead of V8.  Now, I don't know what the deal was, but the drink is AMAZING.  The glass is also rimmed with salt and pepper and super SPICY!  For those of you who know how much I drink (please sense sarcasm)... I can down these baby faster than my boyfriend and can have at least 2 within an hour.  It was just THAT good!  Anyways... we tried Anju's Kimchi Caesar and it was pretty good.  I prefer a \"regular\" Caesar, but this wasn't bad either.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, hated it.  He didn't like the kimchi mixed with it (and you do get pieces of kimchi in the drink). 

Overall, I liked this place.  The restaurant is located in a two story house.  You could walk right past it if you're not looking for it.  The place was also very small.  There weren't a lot of tables/seating.  The upstairs had a bar and what looks to be a lounge area.  This place is definitely worth trying out if you're ever in Calgary, Canada."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Chef Roy Oh's take on Korean cuisine and recently, I finally had the opportunity to see what his restaurant Anju was all about. Tucked away in a cozy corner of downtown Calgary in a renovated 2-story house, this unassuming building was about to yield its secrets to this anxious diner. Eat to drink, Drink to live, Live to eat. This simple mantra which is the first thing you see upon visiting their website speaks of the minimalist grace and style that Anju pulls off so wonderfully, from the design of the space to the flavours of the dishes.

Korean food is known for its use of spicy chili, fermented kimchi, and the plethora of those curious little sides, called banchan. It's an orchestrated composition of umami with high notes and low, balancing the spice with savoury and sweet. Colours and textures all play an important role as the dishes come alive before your eyes and on your palate. The 7 course tasting menu was about to show me what Anju was all about.

We started off with a spicy salmon taco with a sesame slaw on crispy wonton taco shells. The dressing of the slaw was a delicate balance of that roasted sesame flavour with a touch of acidity. Of course, you can't go wrong with raw salmon. Cool and meaty, it was a great start to an evening.

What followed was probably one of my favourite dishes of the night. A beautiful braised oxtail tortellini with soy topped with shaved grana padano. That oxtail was simple yet sublime with a solid savoury, slightly sweet base complemented by the sharp hit from the grana padano for the ultimate punch of umami in a single bite. Unreal.

Next was panko breaded crispy tofu with sautéed kimchi and citrus aioli. The crispy panko was seasoned to make it slightly spicy, but not overwhelming. It's textural contrast with the silky tofu underneath was well executed and the kimchi underneath was clean tasting, yet faithful to the essence of what you expect from kimchi. Top that with the citrus aioli bringing its hint of sweetness and you have one delicious starter. 

The housemade kimchi here is a brand all its own, I might add. It doesn't have a heavy, super fermented flavour, but the fermentation flavour does shine through, giving this kimchi a taste that's unique. It's almost reminiscent of a sparkling white. Seriously. I think that this is important as the kimchi plays a huge role as an element to a lot of the dishes here.

What arrived next was the wings I have always been hearing about. Korean fried chicken, or KFC as it's affectionately known as, has a signature style. It's a super-crispy double-fried chicken, in this case, the wings which are then coated with a spicy/sweet gochujang sauce. These wings, in my opinion, can drop the other hot wings like a bag of dirt. Anju's tasting sampler came with 3 flavours - salt and szechuan pepper, teriyaki, and gochuajng. 

First off, these wings are enormous and when they arrive at the table, they almost tell you that they mean business. The crunch factor is equally as impressive and the meat inside is tender and juicy. Sauces are well balanced and flavourful. What I did appreciate was the salt and pepper wings. The aroma of the salt and szechuan pepper was enticing while the flavour was what you'd expect from a well-seasoned piece of meat. A subtle yet effective way to highlight the quality of the chicken itself.

The kalbi that arrived next was tender and tasty. Silver Sage produces some good beef and these short ribs were perfectly grilled and marinated. To accompany this was a simple plate of roasted Brussels sprouts with lop cheong and a lemongrass dressing that was delicious. The lemongrass provided balance to the richness of the thinly sliced lop cheong, all brought together with these roasted Brussels sprouts which have you hunting around the plate for the charred bits.

Finally, the pork shoulder bo ssam. In this mini-version of bo ssam, you still get the fresh lettuce wraps and mint with all the toppings and condiments, just in a smaller presentation. The pork shoulder is pulled and dressed with sauce and roasted peppers and includes the delicious bits of crispy ends you get with a full roast, so you're not missing a thing. The richness of the meat comes through as you bite into the fresh, crisp lettuce wrap with the herbaceous hint of mint leaf and whatever else you choose to top your perfect handful of goodness.

To finish, ice cream bars were the perfect way to end the meal. With flavours like mango and honeydew, I was brought back to the grocer's freezer at T&T for the first time, thinking to myself how Asian ice cream makers could make such awesome confections.

Great job, Anju! I love your work and I will be back."}
{"text":"November Challenge -  2/30

The last couple of birthdays I've had were thrown together haphazardly at the last minute. This year, since I was turning the age I always introduced myself as when I was pretending to be a teacher at six years old, I decided a little more effort was necessary. So a month prior, I was on the phone with Anju and their awesome manager, Diane. At first I was hesitant; Anju has a policy that large groups must do the tasting menu and now, since one of the tasting menu items requires 24 hours of prep, a credit card number has to be given so that they don't eat the cost of the food in case you decide to bail for whatever reason. While I am more than sympathetic to that plight, all I could think was:

FUUUUUU. I need to treat this reservation like I'm organizing a wedding dinner!

So I was on the phone for three weeks; yelling at friends, sewing voodoo dolls together, making sure that everyone who said, \"yeah, sure\" was saying a definite, \"fuck, yeah!\" Especially because not only were they creating a feast that required 24 hours of prep, they were creating unique tofu dishes especially for me. And not many places in the city - unless they are catering specifically to vegetarians - will do that for you, so every time I thought about it, a smile crept along my face.

Anju only has one area that was large enough to accomodate my party of 20: A long table in their room that faces the open kitchen. This meant that some of my friends that didn't really know each other were going to have to get better acquainted, and that some of us weren't going to be able to talk to each other unless I went up and down the table and hugged everyone (which I did!). 

Service was first-class from start to finish, with Diane and her army of adorable servers making sure everyone was well accommodated and looked after, especially this vegan and my friend that has a gluten allergy. She was way more vigilant than I was (especially after a couple of Matchatinis) and quickly whisked away a plate that I had absentmindedly put a sauce on, that contained seafood ingredients. Thanks!

Appetizers were their famous tofu puffs (made vegan and gluten-free for my friend and I), edamame and oysters. I eat edamame at home all day long, but Anju's were easily the best edamame I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, there was a lot of that sentiment going around at the table:

\"This is the best edamame I have ever put in my mouth.\"

\"These are the best oysters I have ever had.\"

\"Oh my God, what is this... it's TOFU?! I HATE TOFU! OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS TOFU.\"

When I checked in with the Yelp app, I was given the opportunity to purchase a round of Soju shots for the entire table and a complimentary appetizer. The Soju comes in different flavors, and my choice, the Passionfruit, I would definitely recommend getting again. Like slaking back a shotglass of sunshine! Since I had read many amazing things about Anju's truffled sweet potato fries, I went ahead and asked for those, and was not disappointed. Fries are my favorite food, especially sweet potato fries, and now Anju has probably spoiled me from eating them anywhere else. 

Next came the Gochujang Wings (and a tofu version for me). I grew up on Korean food (it's how my parents met - my Mom was a waitress at a Korean restaurant and my Dad owned the bar above it), so my standards for Korean fare are high. The Gochujang Tofu wings tasted just how my Mom might make them, although definitely with more kick. In fact, I think I might like them better than my Mom's? Don't tell her. 

The main course: Braised Pork Shoulder Lettuce Wraps (and Tofu Steak Lettuce Wraps for me!). There is never a delicate way to eat Romaine lettuce wraps. Sauce and food will get all over your arms all the way to your elbows. Anju had posted a photo on Instagram earlier that day, showing us the pork shoulder being prepared, so I was surrounded by friends drooling in anticipa----------



-----tion. It was quickly devoured and inhaled, sauce was all over our arms and zero fucks were given because you were happy to lick that sauce off your arms! Happy! Sad that some could not lick it off their own elbows!

I can ;).

I was already rubbing my belly and ready for a couple of winks, before dancing later that night, when dessert finally came. No overly ostentatious plates of chocolate something, that was thawed out from a box and drowning in sauce and whipped cream: dessert was simply Melona ice cream bars (and a bowl of fruit for me). Sure, my bowl of fruit was probably cocktail garnishes, but cocktail garnishes are delicious! Seriously, the perfect end to a decadent meal that two weeks later, my friends are still talking about. 

Later on that night, I saw Anju tweet hi-fives to their staff for seamlessly serving our large group. They were well-deserved hi-fives. This was the best birthday dinner I have ever had. Thanks, Anju! And thanks, Diane! You are a lady and a scholar.

300th REVIEW! :D"}
{"text":"Oh.. My... God... I am full!
I arrived home from this restaurant tonight and did not even want to brush my teeth - but I did! I wanted this taste to linger in my mouth for-ever!!!!!!!!!!!
13 of us gathered to share some Asian Fusion Tapas, kind of a new thing for me, and I personally had never been to this place before. MMMMM. What a gem!
We found this eatery easily in a house converted to a restaurant with free parking after 6pm in a lot across the road. What ambiance this place has! Low lighting, up to the minute decor - a perfect date place. The hostess was great! The server was pure awesomeness, one of the best out there. No water glass ever stayed empty complete with a little cranberry for decoration! Nor did our little Soju shot glasses ever go empty !  :)
As we waited for everyone to arrive, a few of partook in some Kimchee and flavoured Soju. WOW, why have I not had this sweet, juicy, alcoholic drink before? The first one we tried was lychee. Then came the aloe vera (huh? I know, I said that too but it worked!) then the mango, then the passion fruit. I would have to say the mango won out. I will be back here for this drink alone!
We went through hours of eating, doing a tasting getting more and more stuffed until of course we all ended the evening with the best popsicle I have ever had.

Food:
Spicy chicken wings (my fave) I did not know Korean food could be so spicy - my own cayenne pepper never needed to make an appearance! :) 
Fish, head on
Yam fries with a truffle dip (my fave #2)
Crispy tofu
Clams in a black bean sauce
Oysters on the half shell, raw
Lettuce wrapped grilled pork shoulder, steak (loved), lemon grass chicken with allllll kinds of garnishes and sauces

The creamy popsicles came in banana (my choice), strawberry, melon and mango.

Everything at this place was perfect, even the music was varied and had a good vibe. Of course good food has to be shared with good people and we had that going for us tonight! Washrooms, spotless. I heard that this place is NOT open for lunch and that they are closed on Sundays.

A must try when you can go and remember the Korean rule (#6 maybe?) Never let a friend's glass go empty!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Given the mainly positive reviews of Anju here on Yelp, I came in with high expectations and was excited to try it.

Hits: chicken and pa-ffles, salmon tacos, kimchi fried rice, pork belly lettuce wraps, chicken wings. These were outstanding, offering great textures and flavour combinations. These guys know how to cook an egg--which is sourced locally as well. The chicken is apparently from Okotoks and comes out in the meatiness and quality. The chicken and pa-ffles comes with their signature hot sauce--so keep this in mind if you plan on also ordering their perfectly cooked chicken wings. We ended up getting the same sauce by accident (which was fine--it was delicious).

Misses: mussels, prawns, anchovies, beet salad, beef rice bowl -- they weren't necessarily bad, just overpriced in my opinion for protein content and such, especially compared to the items I listed above.

For six people with a few drinks, it came to $300 before tip, but we were full. Next time, I'll be trying the Wagyu beef and probably having more kimchi rice and salmon tacos.  Service was very friendly. It started a bit slow but the pace quickly ramped up to a frenzy once plates arrived. Like any tapas place, you have to manually pace yourself. NOT easy with so many great dishes on the table."}
{"text":"Well I was super excited after reading the reviews and I must say I was disappointed. The waitress started out great explaining everything to us but I couldn't tell you who she was since 2 people ran our food and another topped our water. The we had short ribs that were really good, but that's where it ended. We had chicken wings that were big but dry and overcooked. The house sauce was ok but it tasted like it could be hot and BBQ from any chain. We also had the teriyaki chicken wraps. The sauce was just dropped on the chicken, not authentic and it was maybe half a breast. There was not enough food to fill the 5 lettuce. There wasn't even 5 pieces of Thai basil or garlic. They gave us a coupon when we checked in and the layout was nice but going down the steep steps in heels after a few drinks is a law suit waiting to happen. Overall it wasn't terrible but I won't be back"}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming. Anju, you're the nice guy, the Kevin Arnold of great restaurant dining experiences. Compared to other places that stomp with gusto and strain themselves with overwhelming decor and overdone menus to justify the high dollars, your charm is easily overlooked. I'm glad that within the last two months, we reunited.

I remembered the first time I visited you years ago, I ordered your stone bowl and resolved that this was the next big thing in Calgary, but since I haven't found any restaurants the served it the way you did.

The second time was for an elite event, where I met you humble and shy chef and had a chance to converse with your pretty waitresses and learned that this was a great place to work at

The third time. Wow, was I won over. I feel like that lofty headed Winnie who finally decided to give Kevin what the poor guy was chasing after all those years.

Anyways, my last visit was for a farewell party. I didn't deal with them directly, but Sabz found that they were very engaging and accommodating to our groups large demand. We came to an agreement that a $35 per person tasting meal would suffice. I was a bit skeptical (I wasn't, I'm saying this to add dramatic effect to this review) but come dinner time, we had the most amazing experiences ever! Our server was very friendly and ensured our shot glasses were full of Soju and was the most natural conversationalist, it was as if we were over his house for a dinner party. The kitchen didn't disappoint with our meal and brought out the most delicious dishes, tasty and adventurous enough to liven up the conversation of the table. They were also great enough to arrange a special experience for our vegan diners. 

Overall Anju is one of those places I couldn't' stop raving about not just because of their food, but for the overall experience they provide."}
{"text":"Wow! I invited 18 guests for dinner for a party. Everyone was blown away by the generous portions of food, service and timing of food. We had a big mix of people - some had never tried Korean food and most have not tried Korean fusion. It's not easy to get 18 people to rave about the food but Roy did it!
Roy made a special menu for us: We ate Korean fried chicken wings w/ gochujang - the wings were massive and the coating was so crunchy , saucy and spicy. The tofu w/ sautéed kimchi and citrus aioli was another winner. Crispy morsels packed full of flavour. We turned one tofu hater guest into a lover - not an easy feat. The
Norway mackerel w/ wasabi soy and grilled lemon was grilled to perfection. I devoured everything but the eyeballs. I loved oysters on the half shell w/ kimchi mignonette - fresh and cold and just lovely. It's really such a treat to have excellent seafood in Calgary. The boys loved the whole roasted pork shoulder w/ lettuce, rice, condiments and sides. There was so much of it, the pork was tender and just beautifully done. After last night - this is my go to place for entertaining. Thanks again Roy for all your hard work, talent, and for reserving a whole room for us and letting us bring in our photographer to make the celebration even more memorable.

On another visit, six of us enjoyed $35 fixe price menu - which entailed plate after plate of mouth-watering food. Our favourites included: salmon tacos, oxtail pasta, shrimp with lettuce, agadashi tofu and kimchi and rice bowl with egg, and beef shortribs. I heard that the price has gone up to $40, but in my opinion, that's still the best deal in Calgary."}
{"text":"I know this place is \"all the rage\" right now so I figured I had to find out what all the hype was about. I loved this place so much, I ended up going back two nights in a row!! The interior design done by Amanda Hamilton is so funky, I just love the atmosphere. I'm so glad someone finally turned this gold mine location into a sweet spot. 

I had seafood salad and guacamole here (trying to be healthy) and it was SOO good!! The guac is fresh made at your table, COOL! And my favorite thing about this place....They take reservations! 

Highly recommend this for a trendy night out!"}
{"text":"As a Korean person, when I hear the word \"Korean-fusion\" in the aspect of culinary arts, I cannot help but feel a bit skeptical. While I do not let myself be tied down by my traditional tastes when it comes to judging food, I have never quite liked the sweetened and less spicier version of Korean dishes commonly found in many \"Korean\" restaurants these days. While it is essential to do a good business, I am the type of person who believes that people deserve to get what they naturally expect to get. Therefore, I was never a big fan of eating \"Korean\" food that were modified to be safe for business, rather than authentic.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the restaurant I visited tonight called \"Anju\" met this standard that too many \"Korean\" restaurants have failed to meet. My friend and I ordered calamari, AAA short ribs and sirloin strip steak. While calamari - or deep-fried squid - was not prepared the way I was used to seeing back in South Korea, the sauce that it came with really brought out the Oriental flavor AND stayed true to its Western influence. As for the short ribs, other than the fries that came as its side, it tasted and looked just like the short ribs you would order from a genuine Korean restaurant and lacked any western influence. Sirloin strip steak was prepared like any sirloin strip steak that you would order from a steakhouse, except that it was marinated with a Korean barbecue sauce. 

It was a fascinatingly delightful experience to try their menu and find out how true they were to the main intent of their restaurant. The chefs and the original inventor of these dishes clearly knew what they were making - their integration of flavors and preparation from Western and Korean cultures seemed almost effortless and as natural as it could be. While the meat for both the steak and rib dishes were a bit too chewy for our liking, they both had some remarkably unique flavors, and eating them was a simply delicious experience. Calimari had all the textures and flavors you could possibly desire from it - perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, but still firm enough to have that fun chewiness you get from a flawlessly roasted squid. The dipping sauce for calimari was bizarre in all the best ways possible; it had flavors commonly found in Korean food market, but, as a whole, it was not something completely non-Western that it would overwhelm non-Korean customers. 

My friend and I were lucky enough again to have been there when the restaurant was not busy - in fact, the waitress told us that they were suppose to close due to the day being mostly slow. However, despite our offers of leaving, they decided  to keep the restaurant open a little longer to accommodate us. As was the case for the review for Julio's Barrio, I do not know what the quality of service would be like when the restaurant is busy; nonetheless, the waitress' honest attitude, unique to those who simply try too hard to please you, was rather refreshing and worthy of noting. 

Like any other decent waitresses, she came by our table often to check our cups and see if we needed a refill, and to ask how we were doing with our meal. What set her apart from other waiters and waitresses I have encountered was that she actually observed us and made sure we were doing okay. At one point during the dinner, she must have seen us gnawing on our ribs/short-rib with difficulty, as she came by shortly after and asked if the meat was too chewy. We said yes - though, so as not to be jerks, we added quickly that both the dishes were very tasty nonetheless - and she went around to fetch us knives and told us that she would inform the chefs to ensure the same mistake is not made. 

In my past years of dining experience, I have never been approached by a server when I was visibly not satisfied or having difficulty with what I ordered. The usual case is that I would have to call them over and tell them what is wrong with the meal, regardless of how many times the server walked by to observe me or to ask me how I am doing. Thus, I found it important to point out this part of our overall dining experience at Anju, no matter how trivial it may seem to others. It was truly a great privilege to have been with such a considerate waitress. 

Overall, \"Anju\" will surprise you by living up to its purpose of serving dishes that are a fusion of Korean and Western culinary themes. Despite its sleek interior and a rather high-end look, the prices in the menu are not expensive (appetizers ranging from around $8~10 and main courses ranging from $15~20+) and were also fair based on the quality and the quantity of the dishes. The food there was just amazing and would have been perfect, had the meat not been a tad too chewy. The service was beyond satisfactory - it truly reminded me of why something like a robot can never replace people in service industries. 

Last but not least, would I come back to this place? Definitely."}
{"text":"My visit to Anju was nothing short of amazing.

I'd been previously for a Yelp event and, while I found the space a little small for the number of people that were milling around, the drinks and food were excellent (as was the company!) so I knew I had to go back for a full meal.

We tried on Family Day this year, but it was closed :( I tweeted Anju's Twitter account, as they hadn't mentioned it at all. I understand that they wanted to spend the day with family, but they also agreed that in the future it would be prudent to let people know via social media so we don't show up on the doorstep to a dark restaurant.

Anyhow, I went to Anju with my sister and her boyfriend. We got a bottle of soju as none of us had ever tried it and we were all curious. This stuff is dangerous!! Beware - it goes down smooth and hits you like a truck. 

The food was all delicious. We had the edemame, asparagus, lettuce wraps, truffle fries (they're like crack!!), kimchi and a few other things I can't remember, including an amazing dessert. 

The server was beyond exceptional. He came back to fill glasses (even water) constantly (there was never an empty glass), gave us advice on the menu (and condos in the area), conversed, and we even let him pick a couple of our menu items (and he did well). 

Not only that, but the final price was less than we expected - very, very respectable for what we received.

Would I recommend Anju? In a heartbeat! Would I go back? Even faster! :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely not the first time we have come here and today there were 10 of us. We order our usual chicken wings and tofu, both very delicious. And, of course we ordered the bossum pork shoulder, which has to be ordered 24hrs in advance. When we got our pork shoulder it didn't fall off the bone like it normally does and man does that ruin the experience and flavor of it! We were seriously carving it with a fork, knife and elbow grease. 

We came here to show our friend who we hyped up for the pork. He unfortunately wasn't blown away as we were the other times we've come here. But he truly enjoyed the appies!

I'm sad to give this place a 3, if they cooked the pork shoulder right it would have gotten a 5."}
{"text":"Anju restaurant is extremely memorable for me for it is where I had a successful blind date that soon transformed into my present heart relationship (SIGH).  Anju which in Korean means \"Korean small plates, sent as soon as they are prepared, shared among friends and eaten with alcohol in a comfortable atmosphere\".

Only one year and going strong, Roy Oh, Owner and Executive Chef felt that North America in general had an outdated notion of Korean food and wanted to bring to Calgary a more fun and upscale slant on Korean dishes.  

Menu at Anju is broken down in numerical values of 5, 7, 10 and 15 with many eclectic food options.  Taro root chips, kimchi, organik greens, stone bowls... to name just a few.  Anju also has a nice variety of original cocktails too: my Awesome Johnny was AWESOME made with Hennessey and green tea.  

Anju sits in a two storey modern renovated house on 10th Street SW and 5th Avenue.  The interior is classic and contemporary encased in romantic window views of the Elbow River and Calgary's upper scale condominiums.  The staff and service is pleasant and prices are moderate for such a classy environment.  And the food ... oh the food! They were like heavenly art on small plates.  Definitely worth the visit. I will let the photos speak for themselves.

Accordingly to Roy Oh, the finest ingredient his mom ever used was love...... 5 Stars Roy!"}
{"text":"Went here for my besties birthday after she had been talking it up for months. It did not disappoint, Anju was absolutely amazing. The chicken wings were to die for, and the service was wonderful, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in YYC - one of the few places in the city that I'd heartily recommend picking random items off the menu and loving it.  We always try new items and each time we discover something new to rave about.  Go to this place!"}
{"text":"Oh Anju, how you whirl me about and keep me guessing with this affair.

On frequent visits you woo me with your dark decor, dim sensual lighting. And on other visits you scorn me with your over heating and crabby waitress.

But alas I keep coming back, for those truffled yam fries, and crave your short rib stone pot rice bowl. On late night visits, you lull me with your tapas menu, with those yummy drinks, and you even impress my friends with your tender and juicy roasted pork shoulder in party size. 

You sit there, with those big lustful windows, in your dark mysterious ways. Sigh, will I find another? I think not...."}
{"text":"There's a little place tucked away downtown, over on 10th St between 4th and 5th Ave. It's a little place you may not have been to yet and so they don't know your name... but it's the kind of place that you'll step foot into once. You'll love. And you'll be back... again and again and again. 

Anju's a Korean-fusion joint. Chef Roy Oh hails from the great white north land of Edmonton. And he cheers for the Oilers. For that, we get along already! But besides that, Anju's alive with his heart and soul. And he's got a dedicated staff on board with him all the way.

Most recently, we popped in here for a going away dinner for our dearest yelper Vishnu. With a party of more than 10 people, they do a lovely tasting menu. Tons of food and super reasonable. Only $43! Yeah, you read that right. Our shared dishes consisted of truffled yam rights, the best chicken wings in the world, deep-fried tofu, mackerel, and enough food to pack our lettuce wraps so full, we couldn't even finish them. Oh, and do I dare mention the flavoured soju? Our incredibly sweet, smiley and attentive server Keagan was right, that stuff's dangerous!

If you're ever looking for a spot to host your birthday party, office function, group of friends, people from out of town, whatever it is. You'll be wanting to call Anju first. Regular or not, they'll take care of you...and after that, well, you'll eat happily ever after."}
{"text":"Anju really impressed me right from the get go! As soon as I walked in I recieved a lovely greeting by the hostess who instantly made us feel welcome. I went to sit down at a massive table and my glass was already filled with soju! Truly a great start to an awesome dining experience.

I came here with a big group for my pal Vishnu. We had a surprise going away party for him and boy am I glad we had it at anju, it was truly a perfect setting for this bittersweet special occasion.

The food? we tried a lot of it! Let me list everything we had for apps. Korean chicken wings, grilled mackerel, deep fried tofu with candied Kim chee, clams, oysters, Anju's famous sweet potato fries, all of it was on par, I had no complaints just really tasty well prepared food, I can't even choose a favorite but I will say the sweet potato fries lived up to their reputation! And I must add that the soju kept on coming out glasses were never empty. So on to the main coarse..
  
 Classic korean with a little twist. Meat (roasted pork shoulder, marinated beef and lemon grass chicken) SO Good, all brought with a massive bowl of lettuce leaves , rice and a pile of condiments like hoisin sauce and kim chee. Pure classic! This is my kind of food! 

At the end of the night I was also very pleased that the whole meal and all drinks and dessert came to only 43 dollars each person! Not exactly cheap for a lot of us BUT considering all that we ate, the high quality of food, exceptional wait staff who treated us like valued customers it was well worth every penny and more. I will be back one day! I really really like this place, why can't more restaurants be like anju?"}
{"text":"I went to Anju with a group of 12 people. We had a set menu that was the Chef's selection, family style. I worry about family style sometimes with restaurants because from previous experience you may not get enough to eat, not here. We were served everything from Edamame, Tofu, Chicken Wings (holy shit were they good), Mussels, Pickerel, Short Rib rice dish and Sashimi (plus more) .

 Also, for $10 each from those who wished to participate we had, what seemed like unlimited Soju (I am hooked on the yogurt flavor, trust me). 

The service was great, price was fair and the food was all incredible. I had high expectation's as I have heard a lot of good things about Anju, and they did not disapoint. I will be going back for sure and can't wait to try other items.

P.S. Don't drive if you are pounding back the Soju, train is just down the street. Be safe."}
{"text":"After missing out on the Elite party last month, I was very happy to meet up with a dozen fellow Yelpers for dinner here last weekend. 
I have to thank Sabz for informing the delightful folk at Anju in advance that there would be a veeeeegan (me) in attendance. Chef Roy prepared a special tasting menu for our party, and took care of my lifestyle preferences very specifically as well. While everyone else was gorging themselves on all sorts of omnivorous things, I was treated to my own eats including...
Wakame Salad
Seawead w/Sesame Oil 
Asian Pear Salad 
Grilled eggplant w/soya
Truffled Yam Fries
Tofu lettuce wraps

And when Anju didn't have any vegan friendly desserts, our amazing server decided to make me one of his signature cocktails, the Daisy Cutter, with ingredients I will not disclose as you should just go try it for yourself. 
The service was exceptional and very friendly, with said server making sure our glasses were constantly full of water, and soju (in three different flavours; lychee, aloe, and mango). 
I left full and happy, and was thrilled to be so well taken care of in a city where vegan options are sometimes hard to come by without feeling like you are totally inconveniencing an establishment. The tasting menu was priced very reasonably, especially when considering the wide array of options brought to our table. I would definitely like to visit Anju again! Thanks for the lovely experience guys."}
{"text":"I love Anju!

It has an intimate set up, which is lovely in smaller groups. 
The cocktails were simple and delicious, and the food was divine!
I have always been a little wary of fusion dishes, but Anju made it come together seamlessly. The flavours were rich and the servings were perfect.
Our server was knowledgeable and attentive, and there were also gluten free options available."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for some late night drinks, my friend and I had a quick glance at the menu and decided we wanted to come back for some eats. The food was nothing short of amazing. We shared the asian pear salad, grilled egg plant in spicy soy sauce, lettuce wrap with tofu, crispy tofu w/ sauteed kimchi, citrus aioli, everything was so flavorful and for 2 people this amount was more than enough. I paired my meal with the ginger beer with a shot of gin in it. DELICIOUS! 

I'll definitely be back here in a couple of weeks when I come back to town."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. Anju, you were not my first choice. Post work, feeling the call of some good Korean fried chicken, we headed over to Olive's, our mouths watering and thoughts of the crunchy, juicy drumsticks we were about to devour but lo and behold, Olive's is closed on Mondays. FYI everyone, lest you suffer the same immediate downward spiral of chicken disappointment. 
But then I took a scroll through yelp for some other Korean food options and came across my friend Angelo's review of Anju. Five stars, and rave words. Good enough for me. After finding this non-descript house style restaurant, I am so glad I can now be part of the positive rant.
Because we came at happy hour time, early for dinner, we got a great seat by the window, though we were tempted to eat sideways on the leather couches around another table. Our server was friendly and recommended the gochuang ( I definitely fibbed that spelling, it's fermented chili paste, for the translation) chicken wings if we wanted something spicy, and the stone bowl for something different. We ended up with the asian sesame salad, a pound of half gochuang, half salt & szechwan wings, and the stone bowl with egg and tofu. I had never had gochuang anything before, but the wings were crispy, flavourful, juicy, with just enough kick so that the spice didn't attack you or make you cry. So good. Crack wings. I could have eaten another pound. 
The salad was a nice way to start and the stone bowl was also great, kept everything crackling warm, and cooked the egg well. We tried the special for dessert, banana and nutella goyzas with vanilla bean ice cream. The server was apologetic when it took a little too long to get to the table (they make the nutella themselves, it's all fresh) but yes, the wait was worth it. Even the ice cream had a little kick to it. 
Thank you Anju for spicing the hell out of everything you made so well, and for fulfilling my deepest chicken desires. Oh yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves up \"Korean Fusion\" that is creative, beautiful, and ultimately, DELICIOUS!

A chic little \"nook\" of a restaurant, almost every seat has the ability to look RIGHT into the kitchen and see the chef hard at work. 

The truffled yam fries are a perfect way to start. Perfectly crispy, with that tasty truffled \"funk.\" Because Anju is so certain that they offer \"the best yam fries in Calgary,\" if you're not completely satisfied, they will take them off the bill! I have to say, it is really hard to argue this claim, and I would never dream of even suggesting they take them off the bill.

The pork belly tacos are pretty good, the pomegranate iced tea is refreshing, but the item not to be missed, in my opinion, is the oxtail tortelleni.
For me, this was the be-all, end-all. 
Perfectly balanced, supple little pillows of flavour. Amazing. I often hate it when people describe food in this way, but it is a very \"sexy\" dish!

Given the price, Anju is not a place I think I will be coming to TOO often, but boy, is it ever a treat!"}
{"text":"Wow. Both times I have been to Anju my meal has just been outstanding. When Tiffany N. notified the Yelp world that Anju will be closing its current location at the end of the month since they have outgrown their space, and it may be a few months before a new location is sourced, I jumped at the chance to revisit Anju again with my fellow yelpers.

I was so excited to drink soju, and had to convince my fiance it was the right decision, when he just wanted to get a beer. I knew I couldn't do a whole flagon by myself, but apparently Tiffany N can! We went for the mango aloe soju, which was refreshing and went down so easy. 

Then our plates started to arrive!

Everything Chef Roy touches is pure magic. The spicy salmon tacos, crispy tofu and yam fries were delicious and packed with flavour and perfect for sharing between me and my fiance. We also shared the fried chicken and pa-ffles and holy mother clucker was it ever good. Fried egg on top, 3 huge coated pieces of a sriracha sauce concoction resting on green onion waffles, with a cream pitcher of maple/spicy sauce to drizzle over.
We knew we had to get a piece of everything in every bite, so spent 5 mins deconstructing the plate in easy to chopstick pieces. Sabahat N and her fiance who basically ordred all the same dishes we did (cause they are awesome) were able to eat their chicken and pa-ffles much more gracefully then us.
Seriously, don't even bother getting chicken and waffles at the Waffle and Chix food truck, you will be so disappointed knowing that this homerun of a plate lives at Anju.

As you can tell, I still can't get this meal out of my mind. I wanted to eat dessert so badly, but I was going to burst. I also now want to eat at Anju everyday until it closes, but it might not be a financially responsible decision.

I will miss you in Anju, I promise to come back and visit all the time when you re-open in your fancy new digs. In the meantime, I will be dreaming of my meal for weeks to come."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Anju.   It is a Korean-tapas place that serves up some delicious share plates with portions that are not tiny.

I tried the anchovies, chicken wings, chicken and paffles, kimchi, salmon sashimi tacos, and all were extremely well flavored and unique.

They also had unique drinks, first time I've ever had a \"ramen\" caesar.  A caesar with ramen soup flavouring in the drink and on the rim!

My only gripe was their dessert popsicles were not handmade.

Otherwise, delicious night out."}
