{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I ever ate! WOW did this place blow my socks off. We went out for dinner here the other night under the impression I was going to eat the best ginger beef ever and you know what? It was sensational!

Not only was this ginger beef tender and full of flavour I could actually bite properly into it. The sauce was light and not to thick and there was just enough on the beef. I really hate when my food is swimming in sauce. What a treat.

We ordered the dinner for two. I thought it was reasonably priced around $28 for Spring Rolls, Won Ton soup, Chicken Fried Rice, Ginger beef and mixed veg. I found every dish to be made very well and the Won Tons were amazing. I'm pretty sure I could have eaten them all to myself. We also ordered a side of Salt and pepper squid which was also very tender and cooked perfectly. Lightly battered not over cooked and just the right amount of salt and pepper on top.

If I lived in this area I would probably be here all the time chowing down on different dishes from the menu. I can say my quest for satisfying Chinese food has been filled.

I felt full but not heavy like I sometimes feel after I eat a meal from certain places. The portions were fair not too big and not too small. We still ended up with leftovers even though we went on empty stomachs. I will have to go again!

We reheated the rice yesterday and I still tasted just as good and the rice didn't get dry and hard like it sometimes does from other places.

Also for you yelpers this place is a bit hidden. We got a bit lost trying to find it. It is tucked at the back of a building in a sort of strip mall type building. A good fair amount of parking at this location as well. Fast service was also a huge plus for me nothing worse then being very hungry and watching everyone around you eat while you are waiting for your meal. My stomach gives the rating of 5 stars! I hope this place never changes I'm a lifer from here on."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had. Ingredients weren't fresh, recipes were substandard and delivery was late."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went on Friday night. Two other tables had patrons. Asked for no MSG and got the plainest food ever cooked in bad tasting oil. Service was mediocre and lackluster. Avoid."}
{"text":"Glad we live so close as many Chinese food restaurants are serving double fried and old stale items. Have tried take out twice, ginger chicken, dry ribs and beef and broccoli. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese resturant in this neighborhood hands down, so much better than Billy's. Love their weekday lunch buffet, $10.95 great value."}
{"text":"Bonavista Peking House never disappoints. We were a party of 6 , and all of us loved the 6 dishes ordered. Ginger beef, Peking style pork chops, Malaysian chicken and veggies, prawns in lobster sauce,fried rice,chow fun and beef ( wide flat noodles ,beef, in black bean sauce.....not on the menu ) all rated 5 stars. The sechuan eggplant was not up to par but would rate 3.5 stars. Service was terrific, bringing 2 dishes at a time as opposed to dumping all the dishes on the table at one time. One of the best stops for Chinese food I have found in west Canada .  Try it , you'll-----------"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time but the food isn't really that good I like pang pang better it's a bit pricy but you do get a lot. It's quite place and I like the location but the ginger beef wasn't as good just felt like the flavour was off. The dumplings were not good either just bland and the sauce was sour. I did how ever love the rice and noodles as they were fresh and came out hot. But the price is just to much for me."}
{"text":"I use to really like the lunch buffet here It's still the same buffet, not a huge selection. I believe 8 items in total, plus wonton soup.
The prices are reasonable, 11.95 for adults. 
Here's where I think they could improve upon.  It's the price for my 7 year old that eats like a bird. I asked the lady working there, and she said it was 10.95 for him. 

What???? Only a dollar cheaper for a 7 yr old.
That alone discourages me from wanting to come back.

Oh well. I'm a dad on a budget lol."}
{"text":"The food is pretty average for Chinese food but in Calgary South where authentic Chinese restaurants are very sparse, Bonavista Peking House is....aiiiiite. My family has been eating here for a while now and my favorite dishes are the shrimp with broccoli and also the fried chicken with garlic (ask for extra garlic if you like garlic). The garlic is also fried with the chicken and super crunchy. As with all authentic Chinese food, this is eaten best with lots of people as the portions are meant to be shared."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time last night. The food was good!  Fresh and hot!
Prices are reasonable and the portion sizes were good. Used to order from Bills...but Bonavista is a bit less expensive and much bigger portions...Bonavista Peking will be my new go to place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"It was a good dinner for 2 combo for $33. Very friendly and attentive staff. The food tastes good enough. The ambiance is peaceful and very calm."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, beef with black bean and veg 4 out of five, chicken with canton (thin ) noodles 2 out of five 

Portion size huge, side bowl of white rice and tea all for $ 26, 2 dishes was enough food for 4 people. 

On the north side you need to enter through the drug store entrance as no door on that side for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well been told by a friend at work about this local community Chinese restaurant and was impressed the first few visits. 

Small restaurant with a few traditional Chinese round tables and bunch of 4 seat tables.

Service is good and friendly. Families are welcome and menu has combos and single items to order. 

Have to order Egg Roll as they are delicious and something not served anymore as spring rolls are the rage. 

Portions are decent not large by any means. Not as consistent in terms of  taste since my first visit last October 2014. 

It is westernize Chinese but one of SE better choices."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We've been looking for a new favorite Chinese food restaurant since our previous favorite closed.  This was a first time ordering take-out from this restaurant.  It's not convenient to our home but we are willing to travel for good food.  Reviews seemed to indicate this would be good.  We had family over and we also look forward to some leftovers,  When I called the ordering process was very poor.  Three or four times during ordering people picked up the line and started talking.  It was very confusing.  The order was ready in a reasonalbe time but when it arrived at home it was a mess.  Several of the dishes had leaked.  Sauces from the dumplings had leaked and they needed to be towelled off.  On the menu each order of spring rolls is 2.  We ordered 4 orders of spring rolls (8 spring rolls) and were charged for 4 orders but only got 4 spring rolls(2 orders) so basically were over charged by $6.  The cashew chicken in yellow bean sauce was mostly celery.  We also ordered a dish that wasn't on the menu, chicken and broccoli in garlic sauce.  I was assured they could make this.  What we got had carrots, onions and bok choy and have no idea what the sauce was so it was probably chicken and mixed vegetables from their menu.  Won't likely return."}
