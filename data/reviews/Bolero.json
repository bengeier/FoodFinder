{"text":"Just to put it out there, I absolutely love Bolero and the reason I'm giving it a 3 star rating is because of the Manager/Customer Service aspect of it. I've been here several times for meals and enjoyed it every time, however, there are a few times that I have wanted to go there just to have some of the 'tres leche' cake (which is ABSOLUTELY amazing, I must say) and a couple glasses of wine. Each time, the manager is SO rude to us about doing so and there has also been a few times where I've wanted to take an extra slice home for my parents (as they don't eat meat) and he has absolutely refused to let us do so even when we sat down and ate. I understand that the cake is delicious, but come on?"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with Bolero and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes BBQ meat. If you are a vegetarian this is not the place for you but luckily I am not and love all you can eat BBQ. Thanks and ill be back."}
{"text":"For me personally, Bolero is definitely a restaurant exuding style over substance with an over-priced menu for mediocre food.
Of course, you are probably wondering why the hell a vegetarian was at a bbq house that predominantly caters to meat-lovers.  Well the reason why I went was because I was dragged along for a family dinner.  So right from the get-go, readers, you can skip over my review if you like as i have no idea how the meat tastes.  However based on what my dad and boyfriend report, the meat apparently has lack of flavour, except for having a very smoky flavour????

For first-timers, I do suggest that you either book a reservation a week in advance regardless of how big the party is.  The restaurant at this moment is among the most popular to dine at where getting a table at a decent time can be quite a challenge.  The other option is to either go very early or very late to miss the busy rush.  With the restaurant located just off of Macleod Trail, it is upstairs and directly above another busy eatery, Open Sesame.  If you have already added the two together, it equals a crazy busy parking lot so ensure a few extra minutes of some frustration and stress trying to get a decent spot.

Bolero itself is beautiful, complete with large wooden tables, spacey booths, and dark undertones throughout the restaurant creating a nice and relaxing atmosphere.  Served with two bottles of wine, that was about as good as the dinner got....for me that is.
The concept of Bolero is definitely a MYOM (make-your-own-meal) type of thing which immediately turned me off as I have a strong pet-peeve for food venues like this.  The dinner itself can be quite expensive because it depends on how many meats diners want to try.  The first and most expensive pick off the menu is the Full Rodizio where diners have access to the salad bar and 17 (effing 17!) choices of meats.  The teaser platter is priced at $30 dollars, where you have access to the the salad bar but only two choices of meats, and lastly, those who don't enjoy meat can just dine from the salad bar at $20.  Me being the boring vegetarian stuck to making friends with salad (woot, representing!!!!).  

Although Bolero is a beautiful restuarant, the salad bar didn't cut it for me. Despite the fact that they offered a variety of seafood, roasted vegetables, pasta salads, both a meat and vegetarian stew, and an array of salads, I found the quality and taste was mediocre.  Even if the salad bar was all gourmet, I found most of the vegetables and pasta salads kind of saucy which strangely resembled the taste of Kraft salad dressings.   Not trying to be a snot, I also found the vegetables over-cooked....but who really wants to eat stringy asparagus and zucchini?  The one thing both my boyfriend and I enjoyed during the dinner was the beans and the coconut rice where I actually would go back to Bolero for if I didn't have to pay $20.

Throughout the meal, I got to enjoy the AWESOME....just awesome view of my family gorging themselves on the skewers of meat where I was frankly horrified in how much the human body is capable of digesting.  One thing for sure, I was not nursing a stomach ache on the way home like they were ;) haha.  So despite a beautiful atmosphere and interesting concept of a dinner, Bolero just didn't cut it for me.  Obviously they don't really cater to vegetarians, so the salad bar was a bit of a disappointment for me where it definitely is not a bang for your buck.  I do definitely suggest that people should at least try it once, however, if you are a picky eater in terms of flavour and food quality, you may or may not be faced with disappointment."}
{"text":"Love love love Bolero! This is a once a year, special occasion dinner for us. Usually for a birthday or special night out with friends. I've been here multiple times and the food never ceases to amaze me! 

Make sure to wear your stretchy pants! Skewers of meat come by as often as 3-15 minutes. Sometimes it's nice to get that break in between so you get a chance to digest otherwise you leave feeling like you are going to explode! Make sure to save room for the pineapple. We usually have to skip a few rounds but well worth the wait. Ask for extra pineapple. You will thank me later. Also, skip the carbs at the side buffet. Or just skip the sides altogether. I usually just get a small salad to start so I don't feel like I only ate 3 lbs of meat. 

The ambiance is fun, romantic, and energetic. It's dimly lit and a great place for parties or a date! I once even made an ex take me here on a break up date! It's a fun place to dress up and for $40, come hungry! Not a place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"April,2016, went there with my wife for dinner, the restaurant decor and services is fine, but
the main item is the meat is low quality. I tasted all 13 of their QQB meats and pineapple, I only
have second on pineapple and bacon wrapped chicken. the bacon wrapped Filet Mignon 
is poorly done, most of the meal doesn't have enought sauce and the meat should be better quality, and the lamb is done poorly as well. For the $43 full rodizio ,I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a meat-lover's heaven! They have 17 different types of swords that the gauchos bring around and carve at your table. There many kinds of beef such as pichana, garlic parmesan pichana, alcatra, filet mignon, rib-eye, bacon-wrapped filet, and garlic parmesan striploin. They also have pork sausage, pork tenderloin, garlic parmesan pork loin, bacon wrapped chicken, chicken drumsticks, pork ribs, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, grilled vegetables and even grilled pineapple.

My favourite is definitely most of the beef and the grilled pineapple. If you like you beef still \"mooing\", I definitely would suggest you get a seating earlier in the evening as the meat tends to be more and more cooked as the evening goes on. Tonight was my second time there. When I went first time, I noticed most of the meat being overcooked for my liking because I went later on in the evening. Tonight we had a early seating so everything was still juicy and fresh when we got there.

You definitely need to make reservations, especially for weekends. I have heard that you need to book almost a month in advance if you want a weekend seating."}
{"text":"Been there done that. For the cost it was not worth it for me. Good experience to try once but cant see going back. It was during Christmas week so Im not sure if staff was just tired but the lack of enthusiasm showed. We were also a big group with an assured tip so the service was lacking. As for the food very average it was bbqed meat on skewers meat temps varied everytime it came around as well, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Bolero is a carnivore's paradise. For around $35 a person, you'll be seduced into a world of grilled meat fantasy where gauchos roam from table to table with swords full of every kind of beef, from rump roast to filet mignon. Then there's pork, bacon wrapped chicken, sausage and even grilled pineapple.
As long as your table marker has the green side up, the waiters will continue to stop and ask if you'd like them to cut off more meat for you. It's the best buffet-style steak house in town and the service is always impeccable. If the meat you want hasn't been brought by for a while, the waiter will find it for you.
I have a tendency to overdo it at buffet-style places and I left Bolero with a belly packed full of meat. I couldn't eat beef for a few days after.
The vegetable and side selection buffet could offer more variety, but that is more than made up for with the variety of swords full of perfectly flame-grilled meat. The price makes the place even more attractive. It would still be a deal at a lot more.
If you want to eat there on any day other than Monday or Tuesday though, call ahead a few days before for reservations."}
{"text":"3 Stars

1 for the decor
2 for the service
3 for the grilled pineapple

just ok all you can eat meat + salad bar (the portobello is pretty good)

most of the meat are overcooked...  the rib eye is the meat that i had more than one piece... everything else is really really average...

not recommended...

i came to Calgary for Alberta beef not this..."}
{"text":"An amazing place to just let loose, relax, and eat your body weight in meat.

Seriously, you need to have a plan or you'll slip into a meat coma.

Very beautiful decor; extremely affable servers, and despite the fact that's it's not exactly cheap to eat there, all things considered, it's an excellent value for the quality and the sheer amount of food which comes your way.

My advice to the uninitiated? Come hungry. Pace yourself. Don't make the newbie mistake by helping yourself to too many side dishes. And don't feel obligated to say \"yes\" to every server who comes by with a skewer -- it's totally OK to \"pass\". In fact, you *need* to say \"no\" to some of it if you hope to avert the meat sweats at least until you get to the parking lot.

A perfect place to bring out-of-towners, clients, or anyone you know who's in a \"Roman Gladiator\" cuisine mood."}
{"text":"Brazilian BBQ, with its endless stream of fire roasted meat, is pretty darn good by any standard if you're a carnivore like me. Since there are only really two in town, I'll use this space to compare them.  Bolero has a somewhat larger selection of meats than Gaucho, but I'd have to give the edge to Gaucho on the quality of the meat preparation.  The buffet of side dishes at Bolero is considerably larger than at Gaucho, but Gaucho's has more traditional accompaniments if you're looking for authenticity (e.g. a dearth of vegetables :-)).  Gaucho's has a mean caipirinha (the national cocktail of Brazil), and a relatively sterile and bright decor compared to the dark wooden steakhouse feel of Bolero.  In sum, Gaucho's takes it on quality and authenticity, whereas Bolero takes it on variety and atmosphere...bom apetite!"}
{"text":"Mmmm... Roasted pineapple, you make the world go round. 

As noted in all reviews below, there are 17 different roasted items available. After consuming all 17 in one sitting, I can safely say they are all good or better. Caveat: the lamb is gamey, so if you prefer the taste of your lamb to be hidden under a tonne of seasoning and spices, please avoid. 

Other than that, prepare for meat-sweats. Also, book ahead as it can get quite busy and the restaurant has set times to start dinner. I am guessing this is to ensure that each time get a full rotation of all 17 items."}
{"text":"Had been suggested that we go here for a family dinner. So with great anticipation we arrived on May the 19th, 2016. We were seated and surprised that the servers were all female. We had expected Brazilian Cowboys dressed in traditional garb.  Our servers appeared to actually be the hostesses.  The food was alright, however the service was lacking - very poor.  Because we have had so many people recommend this restaurant to us, we would like to try it again at some point, however were so disappointed I just don't know if we will give them another chance."}
{"text":"I love meat - but even for me, this is a bit overboard.

As a caveat, with most things, I try to aim for moderation. I've never really been able to appreciate buffets, and I find the concept of all-you-can-eat sushi horrifying. I like to have a satisfying meal, but this is the epitome of excess.

I came here with a group on short notice on a Thursday, so the only seating available was right at opening time at 5:00 p.m. No problem, as I heard that the meat gets progressively more cooked throughout the night. I really enjoyed the lamb and the filet mignon. However, I still found that some cuts were overdone even this early on. The grilled pineapple provided a nice contrast.

The salad bar has a reasonable variety to choose from and some tasty cocktail shrimp but obviously the focus here is on the meat parade.

Come hungry, leave too-full-for-comfort. Overall, I rate the food as OK. I think it's a decent value if you \"strategize\" your eating - but is that what eating out is really about?

Three options: $37.50 for meat parade + salad bar, $30 for teaser platter + salad bar, $20 for salad bar only."}
{"text":"At this Brazilian style meat parade, glorious gluttony reigns supreme as each table uses a cue to control the pace of the meal in a red light/green light fashion. The green side signals the gaucho chefs to bring out skewers of sizzling fire-roasted meats to carve at the table. The red side indicates that you are either taking a break or are finished. Turning back to green will cue the Gaucho chefs to resume their beefy blitz.

Garlic parmesan striploin, filet mignon, lamb chops, slow-roasted pork ribs, sirloin; the seemingly endless list of delicacies can all be had by ordering the Full Rodizio all access pass for $37.50. This passport to culinary paradise also gives you entry to the fresco bar of sumptuous gourmet salads, fresh cut and grilled vegetables, sliced cold cuts and various worldwide cheeses. But wait, that's not all! You can't leave without sampling the hot bar of dishes including coconut rice, creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed collard greens and a classic hearty Brazilian black bean stew. My god; it's magnificent.

For the faint of heart, or those who value coronary consistency, a $30 Teaser Platter is available and offers your choice of two skewered items delivered entrée style. This option also includes access to the fresco and hot bars. You can also access only the fresco bar and hot bar for $20, although I can't fathom why you would. Another plus is that the meats are prepared gluten free, as are most of the fresco bar and salad bar items.

The atmosphere is retro chic, loud, friendly and hot enough to singe your fringe. Service is consistently good and fabulously informal; the witty gauchos always ready to share a laugh with patrons and deliver the skewers you want. A wide range of exotic cocktails and beers are available and wine starts at about $7 per glass.

My advice is: don't stuff yourself at the buffet otherwise you'll never get to truly enjoy the magnificent meaty mains. Bolero is overall accommodating with its offers of bar dining, fireplace, personal wines with a corkage fee and wheelchair access. This is a great place to celebrate or just have a spectacular meal. A couple of great friends, a few drinks and a metric ton of meat will have even the grumpiest gringo satiated and smiling.

The restaurant is located at 6920 MacLeod Trail South Calgary, in the same building as Smuggler's Inn. Enter through the north entrance and head upstairs to a play pen of Brazilian barbecue. I recommend dinner reservations, particularly on weekends...GREEN LIGHT!

{"text":"We're big fans of Bolero.  A great variety of roasts done on rotisserie with great variety of meats and flavors.  The salad bar is very good and has a good variety.  All you can eat and they keep bringing the food to your table until you're stuffed.  The baked cheese is a real favorite.  Great value considering the fact it's all you can eat meat and includes everything but drinks.  Always a great place to bring out of town visitors who have never been to a Brazilian restaurant with skewer after skewer of beef, pork, chicken, sausage, lamb coming by.

Several highlights apart from the meatarian experience is the roasted Halloumi cheese that is somewhere between mozzarella in texture and feta in taste with a browned top, and the glazed pineapple that with the brown sugar glaze sliced off the skewer served hot is all the dessert we want."}
{"text":"I went to Bolero for a friend's birthday party. Really well decor and food service from friendly staff. 
I went for their Alacarte, which is the one you should go with to try all their vast range of meat.
Good selection of drinks and great place to bring a date or friends and family.
It is a little pricey, but for the food offerings it is well justified."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO.  If you like ribs that are like chewing on shoe leather, Brazilian cheese balls are like chewing on an indian rubber ball, filet mignon is raw and EXTREMELY tough.  I have eaten at brazilian steak houses all over North America and Caribbean, and this was the worst one I have been to.

Sorry to say that McDonalds has a better gourmet meal.  With the plastic fries and saw dust filled burger meat.

If I could give this review a negative 5 star, I would."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was the bomb. The atmosphere is like a dark ski lodge with a big fire going.  About $40 each will get you an all you can eat pass as long as you keep the green side up.  All of the meat was perfectly cooked and they definitely take advantage of the local AAA beef because all of the highend cuts tasted just like they should.  I thought they might overspice some of the meat because this is a brazilian joint but that wasn't a problem at all.  It's basically a high quality meat buffet but you don't have to get up....the servers bring everything on swords to your table.  I warn you to stay away from the salad bar because it's full of tasty treats that are meant to fill you up.  The wine list is extensive and decently priced and they also make a mean Caesar.  I'll definitely be bringing guests and clients here whenever were really hungry and have some time to kill."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to go to Bolero for a meal as part of an office Christmas party, and it was an all round good time!  Friendly attentive service, and the variety of skewers of meat that kept coming around beat me into a near carnivorous stupor.

A parade of very tasty and flavourful beef (filet mignon, ribeye, top sirloin), seafood, pineapple, a couple of amazing pork skewers... VERY good.

I will definitely be returning, and would recommend Bolero in a heartbeat for anything from a small intimate date to a large party.  And bring an appetite. A *big* appetite."}
{"text":"Im a big fan. Go here often. Its a nice change of pace from your typical dining experience. The trick is to try everything the first time, then be selective to the specific meat you enjoyed."}
{"text":"Meat heaven.  If you're a meatatarian, this is your destination.  And the pineapple is good to reset your taste buds for the next skewer of meat."}
{"text":"What a great experience! The room is gorgeous, the food is fantastic and the staff are friendly and helpful. On Sunday my family met at Bolero's for dinner. I have never experienced Brazilian BBQ before but knew what to expect...a lot of meat! I myself is more of a veggie lover so I was happy to see the salad bar. We thought the cost would be about $60/person and were delighted to see it only cost $45. I totally will recommend this restaurant to all meat eaters out there. The only reason I knocked a star off is because the chicken was quite overcooked but no big deal :)"}
{"text":"Eat all the meat! Eat all the meat!

This is not a place a vegetarian would want to be. But if you like meat in many ways, this is the place for you. If you are selective about meat, well then go elsewhere.

I am not and I loved trying all the different options they had. The ribs and sausage were great as was one of the steak options. I was indifferent about the chicken wings but that meant I had more room to focus on some of the pork options! Oh my. So many options.

The \"salad bar\" was decent - nothing to write home about although I loved the bean dish they had there. I get the ficus is the meat but a little more options for vegetables as sides would be great. 

Service was good - very good actually. 

My one beef (ha) was that a couple of times when the chefs brought items around, they weren't at their best anymore. For example, my friend raved about how great the grilled pineapple was when he had had it before. When it came to use, we were getting one of the last slices of it. It was mushy and \"meh\". But a new one came around later and it was the greatest thing I've ever tasted. Had I not had a second chance to try it, I wouldn't have known that. Some of the meat was also near its end and it felt like we were getting the dregs so to speak. Still tasty but didn't look as good.

Neat spot, and a good experience."}
{"text":"The entire experience was so dissaponting.  Especially when I have been looking forward to eating here for years now. We made a reservation for our anniversary and you never would have known from the service. Not even friendly greetings from the staff, it implies they are entitled to your tip and business. We waited for 20 min before we were even served and when we were I felt like we were an inconvenience.  The food was the most disgusting part. Fillet Mignon was served rare, the lamb, sausage and other meat was totally overcooked and rubbery. The salad bar was horrendous! Everything was cold, if even there at all. No hot potato or veggie at dinner time?! Everything we tried was seasoned poorly and had zero love or passion put into it. The only good part of the experience was leaving. I would have been even more angry if we had stayed and paid the $42 per person(which is price without a beverage). With so many fantastic and inspiring restaurants in Calgary, I would never recommend this place, let alone give it a second chance. Such a shame. Apparently it used to be good."}
{"text":"All you can eat good food is the selling point. It is different from buffet which is usually deep fried oily food or filling starch food which is not good food. Even the concept to sample all big variety of great meat is worth to give it a try. They have at least four to five different kind of steak (tenderloin, rib eye, ...), rack of lamb, chicken, must try for veg is the honey pineapple. I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to Bolero for my birthday last year. And I can tell you, the meat is amazing! I don't like pork but, I love Bolero's! Atmosphere is great. Service is very, very quick."}
{"text":"Take it easy on the excellent salad bar, the meat makes its way to the table slowly on large skewers and directly from the rack.  The first time we went we were thinking will we ever get full, but yes the variety of meats and grilled pineapple coming around fills you right up.  The building it located in is opening another restaurant,  smugglers, open sesame,  it only gets better here."}
{"text":"I was hopeful to be impressed, was not.
Firstly they served the cheaper cuts like chicken, sausage & pork. 
After waiting for an hour finally some beef was served. 
Our waiter was a very nice fellow, unfortunately the establishment was lacking. 
The restaurant advertisers 17 cuts of meat for dinner, we never saw 17 cuts served, after  1 3/4 hrs in the restaurant we cut our losses and left.
The salad and hot sides were ok, nothing outstanding.
I have been fortunate to eat in many Brazilian restaurants around the world, so I write this with experience on my side. 
Won't waste my time at Bolero again."}
{"text":"Well since Edmonton is missing one of these Brazilian rodizios, I was so tempted on finding one of these joints.  So it's a very hard place to get to if you're from the north as Macleod Trail is separated by a median and you have to make a U-turn one block south or turn on the next 2 streets to get here. 

So after finally arriving, this place is almost as dark as a steak house but still a pretty good atmosphere.  We were seated in a u-shaped booth which made it kind of difficult to maneuver, but we managed.  First came our drinks.  We first ordered caipirinhas.  Too much ice for a small serving.  It was $7 a drink.  At the other rodizios I'd been to, they were $10 but served a lot more liquor.  

The buffet bar was pretty good with salad, fish, cold cuts, veggies, etc.  But at these places you have to make sure you don't stuff yourself at the buffet otherwise you'll never get to really enjoy the main course.  THE MEAT!  Well I can't list off all the variations of beef, lamb, chicken, and fish but they were delicious to say the least.  I was a little disappointed by thethe flavouring of some of the meats and pineapple.  I found there was more seasoning at other places I've visited and the pineapple wasn't as caramel-ly as I've normally had.

So overall with the atmosphere and dining experience in comparison to Malagueta (Pasadena), Brasa (Niagara Falls), Red Violin and Copacabana (Toronto), this place is in the middle of the pack.   But I would definitely go back just because I love Brazilian food."}
{"text":"I have to admit that if you're going to there to eat be prepared not to eat for a day cause wow as the food is top notch and serving as much as you want..  the service from the gauchos where a 10/10 and they know how to serve you. You will not regret going there.. the pineapple omg to die for lol... by the way the marketing on Facebook and Instagram is always wanting to go there and the other restaurants.."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when my husband said he was taking me to a Brazilian bbq. 

The host that greeted us was great! First impression was excellent. 

We were seated quickly with our reservation. 

Our server explained the flow of the evening. Each table had a tri coloured pillar. GREEN to keep the BBQ choices coming. RED to stop the food and give us time to catch up. YELLOW we are done. 

The salads and side dishes were served buffet style. Every salad and side dish I had was delicious! Marinated Mushroom, tomato and olive salad was one of my faves!

Once we filled our plates with the sides and flipped our pillar to green the BBQ choices started arriving! Sirloin, lamb, sausage, chicken wings, bacon wrapped chicken, bacon wrapped filet. I think there were at least 15 different BBQ choices. The highlight for me was the BBQ cheese!!!!! Absolutely delicious. 

The servers slice off a nice small piece table side and you use your tongs provided to take your portion. It is a fun way to eat. 

Every BBQ item was perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. 

I love this place. It was fairly busy but the servers were great. No wait!

It was recommended reservations are made a month in advance during the Christmas season, November and December."}
{"text":"Worst service and staff . Very racist and unprofessional.
They were rude and treating as we are getting the food for free ."}
{"text":"Better than Goucho but...

Service was average, one of the staff knocked over a glass of water while carving meat.  She did not seem to care....just wanted the rest of the table to take meat.  We asked for napkins to clean the mess up and had to ask three times.  We had a late reservation and that made the meat supply low.  I think the cook was in the deep end....meat came out raw or burnt.  The pineapple was burnt on one side and not cooked on the other...so I suspect it was not getting the correct level of attention.  The Tres Lecche cake was excellent.  While I still prefer this over other Brazilian BBQ's in the city....they need to step up their game in order to keep that up."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience . We sat in the perfect booth and the staff was friendly and fast .. Great food and would highly recommend . Buffett was full of variety and the meat was incredible . Love this place . Thank you ."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Though their price did go up, it's nice to go and enjoy a meal served at your pace. Save room for dessert:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for brunch on sundays. Great service especially the server from turkey is very friendly and makes sure you're well served during your stay. Food is incredible the only thing that really missing for brunch is baguette or even bread or roast. There's nothing to put your cheese on. But everything else is top"}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times, maybe three times in the past two years, and ive enjoyed the meal and service each time. They do have some room for improvement though.

My favourite meat items were the rack of lamb, tenderloin and grilled fruit (grapefruit / pineapple). I think they try to fill you up with the 'cheaper' meats though, and rarely bring over the expensive stuff. 

You are kind of at the mercy of their staff walking around with the meats, in regards to what they bring and how often. We've requested certain items but it takes a LONG time for them to come around with them. 

The salad bar is mediocre.

The fun thing about desserts is they bring over a platter of \"plastic versions\" so you can get a visual of them. It's a little too big of a dessert menu though if that could be a criticism... there were like 6-7 choices and when the waiter runs down the list verbally, its a little over whelming and difficult to remember what they just said. 

Overall it's a pricey meal, like $35-45 a person if you have a drink too."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Worth the price because they will come around multiple times with the meat."}
{"text":"Our first time to Bolero did not disappoint! All four in our party did the \"full rodizio\" and we left extremely satisfied! The salad bar was fresh and very appetizing. Our waiter was nice but myself and another one of our party were left with empty drinks for quite awhile, definitely a negative! The meat served by the Gauchos was excellent however, a little inconsistently cooked. I commend the lone female Gaucho on duty who quickly caught an undercooked pork and whisked it away promptly. Kudos to her, not so much, the chef. All in all it was a nice experience in a romantically set restaurant. The prices were reasonable and the positives outweighed the negatives so we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"i took my husband here for his birthday, since he can pretty much instill terror in any all-you-can-eat restaurant managers heart I figured it would be a no brainer. But oh i was wrong, the lamb was as gamey as gamey gets, the other meats were good but nothing over the top fantastic. I will admit the bbq pineapple was fan-freaking-tastic, but that was it. the \"salad bar\" if you could call it that was disgusting, no real options and most of it looked like something from a dumpster. We kept asking for the bbq veggies, but alas never got any. all in all it was a bust. And, while i did leave full, it was a mediocre uncomfortable full that just wasnt worth it."}
{"text":"Imagine if you will a place where you can get an endless supply of succulent, mouthwatering meat, slow roasted over hot glowing coals to juicy perfection. Prime rib, pork tenderloin, chicken legs, even pineapple, lovingly prepared and brought to your table. As long as you got the \"green light\" on, the passadores (meat waiters) with the giant skewers full of meat keep on coming til you can't take anymore. Bolero is a meat lover's paradise. This type of cooking style, reminiscent of the gaucho fireside cookout is called churrasco and is becoming a popular restaurant trend.

Though Bolero has been around for years, I had never had the opportunity to visit until recently. I had always heard that Bolero is the premiere destination for this type of dining, so it was inevitable that I would be sampling their rodizio (full service) menu. Basically, dinner works like this: You have a little wooden token at your table with one end painted green and one end painted red. As long as the green end is up, the passadores will come bearing meat gifts on giant skewers until you've had enough and turn over your token to red. 

In addition to the glorious trademark South American style barbecue (which they do very well) which includes such signature selections as picanha (beef top sirloin cap), filet mignon and a simple, but sublime grilled pineapple, Bolero also has an incredible buffet of sides and salads. Though they're all delicious, don't forget to save room for the meat! Dessert is done just as well and when you're just about ready to tap out, make sure you try the tres leches, a delicious cake made with 3 types of milk. Unbelievable.

To sum up the experience, it was a nice and quiet evening out. Great spot for a date or a small get together, though I'm sure big groups will have fun as well. Hail to the burning beast!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent tried several types of meats was amazing loved the grilled pineapple. I ate myself into a food coma. Excellent coconut rice as well."}
{"text":"I have been to Bolero twice and both times it was a great experience. I was there this past thursday on a girls date with my bff and it was her first time experience the experience. Yes I just said that... 

I will start off by saying if you are going to do the whole wabam for 37.50 you better be hungry!!! This place is great for men because they can really get their money's worth whereas two small women? Not so much.

The place isn't huge but it has a modern romantic feel. There were a lot of couples there along with big groups. This place is great for a big group because it is a very interactive experience. 

The food was delicious. There are 17 skewers that they come around with and each of them is amazing. I won't go through everything, just favourites otherwise this review will be crazy long.I will say that after a bunch of steak and meat, it starts to taste the same after awhile. However, if you take small breaks in between every couple of meats, it's fine. My favourite is the linguica. Best sausage ever. I also really enjoy the rack of lamb. It's not strong in taste; it's a very mild lamb flavour for those who don't really like lamb. 

My bestie and I adored the pineapple. The first time I had it I didn't like it and I can't understand why because it is so delicious. I wish i could eat pineapple like that all the time. There is a smoky sweet flavour that we enjoyed so much that our waiter brought it by twice for us. Soo soo good.

We surprisngly ordered dessert. They have an array of desserts that all sounded delicious but we decided on the creme brulee trio. They were all different, and to be honest they all tasted the same which was fine because I personally love creme brulee. Another quick thing, I don't rememeber what it was like the first time I went, but I found this time alot of the meats were cooked rare. I always have my meat rare but for those who don't like it, that's just a small heads up.

Bolero is awesome and I really recommend it to those who love meat. It's creates a meat coma!"}
{"text":"The grilled pineapple at Sunday Bruch is to die for. I'm graving it night and day ever since I tried them last Sunday. I love how they walk around with different dishes to the tables. You flip up the green side of the pillar if you want them to come by, and red if you want them to stop coming by with BBQ- ed choices. So fresh and yummy. The only thing I really think they lacked was bread. They have croissants and some kind of sweet bread from the grill, but there's no selection of buns and bread, which would go really well with the ham, salmon, sausages, and cheese etc. 
It was such a luxury to start of the day with a long Brunch, Mimosas and finish off with mouthwatering desserts and cakes. One of my new favorite places. I would have given 5 stars if there would be more bread. Service was fantastic from the entire crew"}
{"text":"Filet Mignon, Ribeye, more kinds of meat than I can remember and lots wrapped in bacon! $42 is very well priced when you do it all you can eat style. I would have paid the same to get some little 4oz piece of steak at any of Calgary's so called finer steak houses. The service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I love Bolero. Usually only reserved for special occasions, but if we haven't been in awhile we'll just go for fun. It is pricey, but worth it if you love meat. 

The most shocking thing I see when I'm reading reviews of here is how people are complaining that they aren't very accommodating to children. This is not a family-style restaurant. They accommodate children, but it's not a place I'd recommend taking a kid. It's all you can eat meat and the meal usually takes upwards of two and a half hours. That's not fair to your kid or to the other patrons of the restaurant. I'm sure I'm going to get hater comments on this, but it's true.  

The food is all spit roasted and served gaucho style at your table. The Pineapple is amazing and when you pair it with the haloomi cheese they have it's like a taste explosion of sweet and salty in your mouth. 

If you're fortunate enough to have room for dessert, I recommend them all. Haha. The Key lime cheesecake with brule topping is SO GOOD. And the tres leches cake is WAY too sweet for me but it's delicious. The pineapple and ice cream is another favorite of ours , but it's big enough to share between 2 or 3 people for sure.  

The Gauchos are accommodating to requests. Every time I've been, if there's something we wanted that they hadn't brought around yet or if we wanted more of something, they always brought it right away. (Or as soon as possible.)"}
{"text":"We decided to try this gem the week following the Calgary Stampede.  Some might think that after 10 days of Stampede there should be a beef moratorium.  I do not subscribe to that theory.
If you have never experienced \"a Brazilian Style of Steak house\" you should.  Its a fun evening for a group or even a few friends.  The Fresco Bar  has all the sides you would expect.  Salads, potatoes, vegetables and such, but the real winner it the coconut rice.  At least three helpings should be in your future.  The servers continuously bring skewers of roast meats and they are endless.  It was a great opportunity to try the typical meats but have them prepared in the unique Brazilian way.  The best was the Ribeye Steak was clearly the best but many of the others were very good. However, as a full fledged carnivore it is with some embarrassment that I admit that the grilled pineapple was my second favourite.
I couldn't come here weekly because the fire roasted preparation kind of makes everything taste similar but monthly sounds wonderful."}
{"text":"I've been to Bolero about 5-8 times now and it is a nice place to go about one or two times a year. The food is always delicious and given it's all you can eat, most big eaters will get their money's worth.

The reason I'm giving it 3/5 is for a few reasons:
1) They changed their menu over the past year and no longer include some of the best items that are difficult to find elsewhere (garlic parmesan picahna, for example). This was one of the items that I would think about before going and when I realized it was no longer on the menu (and there was nothing to replace it), I was very disappointed.

2) The meat is usually done medium-rare. For someone who likes their food to not be alive by the time they eat it, it can be a little offputting to have raw meat oozing blood on your plate. They usually have portions that are a little bit more well-done, but they are either a) charred or b) medium at best c) very small.

3) Overpriced. As I said before, if you're a big eater, you'll get your money's worth. However, if you're a regular, healthy-sized meal eater who doesn't starve themselves before they go, you will most certainly not get your money's worth. Their prices have also gone up now and are about $39 for the whole she-bang (meat+hot and cold bar). It used to be $32. This is why I only go twice a year at most.

4) They always seem to come with the same meats which you don't like and never serve the really good stuff you want. Can't tell you how many times all I want is a piece of filet mignon and all that comes around is ribs. Seriously. However, the waiters are pretty good and if they notice that you keep saying no, they'll ask you if there is something you want specifically and will bring it to you.

Overall, if you love meat and plan on having an absolutely huge meal, this could be a good place to go once a year. If you are a vegetarian, small eater, or anyone who doesn't make over 60K a year, it's not worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Incredible food, service, and atmosphere. 
For $35 you get all the amazing meat you can eat. Make sure you prepare a game plan and don't waste too much time on the filling Buffett.  Once the meat starts coming it doesn't stop. 

Amazing place."}
{"text":"Had a Sunday brunch here, meal was fantastic, service was great, price was good.
I will definitely be returning to this great place.
Every piece of this meal was mouth watering."}
{"text":"I've been to Bolero several times and, assuming you enjoy grilled meat, I recommend it.  The meats consistently taste very good and having a meal with a variety of different meats is enjoyable.  The salad bar offers much more variety than just \"Caesar or garden\" so you can choose some nice side dishes.
There are some downsides in my experience.  The size of the restaurant and the way they prepare and cut the meats takes away the true Brazilian feel.  If you want a second serving of a specific item it tends to take a long time for it to come to your table.  There are other options if you are looking for more authentic, family-style rodizio.
Also, the items that are prepared (both meats and salad bar) are always the same - this is a plus as far as consistency but a negative if you're looking for creativity in your meal.
I've always found the service to be friendly and overall find going to Bolero to be a good experience."}
{"text":"Good for brunch but a bit pricey for dinner. We have been several times and would recommend it to anyone celebrating something special. 

It is a lively atmosphere and the selection of meats is good. If the item you want isn't coming around, simply ask the waitress/waiter to bring it over and if it is available they will. 

Disclaimer: not suitable for vegetarians"}
{"text":"All you can eat meat. That statement alone receives all the stars in the world. 
Put that meat on skewers that is carved right at your table? Awesome-sauce wrapped in bacon.

I made a point of completing the list at my table, painstakingly ticking off each item of delicious morsel of animal flesh BBQ'd to perfection that came to my table. I opted to only have a small plate of cheese from the salad bar before the meal began in order to indulge my carnivorous cravings. Meat sweats and salts had me satiate my thirst with a delicious red wine. The grilled pineapple and grapefruit were fun surprises for my taste buds (and helped to keep the meal balanced).

If you're vegetarian? Probably not the place for you. We all have our demons to face though, right? The staff was polite but were all business -- they would carve and move on, no time for witty banter. 

The atmosphere is as heavy as the meal you consume. Dark woods, dark colours, dim lights -- I felt as though I were in my cave about to dive into the carcass I spent the day hunting. The fireplace was a nice touch to this imagery.

Go hungry."}
{"text":"MMMMMEAT!!!! Do not bring your veggie friends here. They will hate it lol   Make sure you book a table weeks in advance if you want to eat there on the weekend. I eat there during the week. Sad to see the leg of lamb off the menu. BRING IT BACK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my Husband and his Brothers birthday - the staff were amazing and let me set up the table beforehand and even bring balloons and sprinkle confetti (sorry!). The food was even better - a huge selection and oh so tasty! I was having meat sweats at the table but I just couldn't find it in myself to tell them to stop feeding me haha!
I would definitely go back and hope to do so soon!!"}
{"text":"Have always had a great experience, great restaurant to take the family. I love the selection of the salad bar, and the BBQ is delicious. They are fast at arriving and serving you, who can resist all you can eat meat and salad bar. The deserts are yummy, especially the Tres Leche(a traditional cake) so good, and don't forget the grilled pineapple is something I never get tired of. Enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"We went there on this past Mother's Day. I've been there twice before and the food is very good although very expensive. It was more the service that was the problem. We sat in the far right corner of the restaurant and were pretty much forgotten. I had to complain twice for us and the other table there. Once I did that the service improved and the manager assisted in serving. They tried to make it right by comping two desserts but at the end of the day the overall experience was not very good."}
{"text":"Outstanding - total food coma
great food
great service"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had a great birthday dinner here in August, tons of meat so bring an appetite!! Our server was great about bringing cocktail refills around, and all the servers were friendly and professional."}
{"text":"It really depends on if you are a big meat lover or not. This place is not cheap, you will end up paying 50-60$ per person, but you will be stuffed !
They have a good selection of wine, and some of the meat varieties they will bring is really nice and unique to this place."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever and it was just amazing from the service to the food it was top notch.  I will be back for sure.  I am surprised the place is not packed every night.  Thank you for everything and I will be back again."}
{"text":"So according to my previous review, my last visit to Bolero was about 3 years ago....and I didn't seem to enjoy it.

Michelle's birthday was coming and she wanted MEAT, so Bolero seemed like a place that would suit her needs and we decided to head there.  We had reservations made for 4:30PM on a Saturday for a party of 8.  We were quickly greeted and our drink orders were taken.  We then had a refresher on how Bolero worked.  There is an unlimited buffet of Brazilian food items: coconut rice (MMMM), beef stew, vegetables, salads, mussels, cheese...etc and then you have a cue (red, green) at one end of your table, red signifying you are stuffed and you do not want meat/pineapple to come by, green signifying you want your belly to be stuffed with meat and you want the table side service to continue.

With Bolero, its not nonstop meat coming by.  The meat comes in cycles....they come by, cut your meat and then I find that you're waiting a bit before the next skewer comes by.  I mean with a group of 8, we were chatting so we weren't bored but we did stop a few times wondering where the meat was!  My favorite meat was the bacon wrapped filet mignon as well as the parmesan crusted pork, super tasty.  The meats were all nice and tender and of course the grilled pineapple hits home run all the time.  It's super sweet but I enjoy that.  The service was good, always alert and filling our drinks.  And it was a sweet surprise that they brought out a tres leche cake for the birthday girl...traditional sponge cake soaked in condensed milk, whipping cream and evaporated milk it was super tasty!  The whipping cream and evaporated milk was kind of an ice cream texture...yum!

Bolero is a once a year or once every two year type of deal.  I'd say, come super hungry and patient to get your moneys worth but I don't seem to feel I get my moneys worth.  The lighting is super dark too."}
{"text":"Not authentic in any way whatsoever. Nothing, not a thing, about this place resembles anything you would consume at a brazilian churrascaria. What an insult! The meat (and most of the rest of the food) is bland and nasty. Definitely a ripoff for what you get. You want unlimited meat? Sure, give it a try. You want good-tasting meat? Go to any other steakhouse in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great experience. Loved the salad bar but not enough for gluten free. 
Meats were delicious but some were underdone for our liking- even though I usually like medium rare. 
The best bits were the pineapple and the goats cheese - so delicious. 
Coconut rice was fabulous too and the black beans were fantastic. 
Brought two kiddos who were really well looked after and really enjoyed themselves. 
Definitely recommend to try this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Bolero twice and as a picky meat eater, I only had to try the full skewer selection/Rodizio once.  The second time I just had the Teaser Platter, being the Fresco Bar, Hot Bar with a choice of two meats.  I nearly fell off of my chair when the two meat portions (I chose chicken legs and Linguica, my favorite) arrived.  It is an insane amount of meat and I had leftovers for days.  I had to share it because I'm sure I would have had the meat sweats and been turned off.  There are some pretty good Hot Bar dishes but the Fresco bar is just okay.  The vegetable skewer is good too.

I do think it's a cool experience that everyone should try once, but I'd only go back if I was invited by someone.  If you are a hardcore meat eater, you likely would give Bolero more stars."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch- the meat tasted like it was cooked over a sterno can at a hobo camp.  Most desserts were disappointing, with the exception of the cheesecake and chocolate mouse cake.   Coffee and OJ were good.   -2 stars
The music was turned up so loud that we could barely chew.    Wait staff didn't add much to the experience.   A credit card fiasco at the end of the meal knocked off another star.   -1 star

When asking one of our friends which part she enjoyed about the experience, she said \"leaving\".     That pretty much sums it up.   

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Was tasty, make it an event though as it will take some time to get your dollar value. Meat is pretty red which is fine by me. The pineapple will change your life and as 6 guys out for the eve it was a great way to spend 4 hours. Keep the green up!"}
{"text":"We dined at Bolero this past weekend.  We have been to Brazilian BBQ before, both in South America (the authentic kind) and to Gaucho's.

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Bolero!  The vast array of meats was incredible, and the hot/cold buffet was average.  Our favorite was bacon-wrapped anything (especially the filet), and the caramelized BBQ pineapple (a MUST HAVE).

Our server was fantastic... cleared the plates as the night went on, and ensured that our wine glasses were always filled."}
{"text":"I've been here three times so far, twice for dinner and once for brunch.  In all honesty, the best deal is the Sunday Brunch, though you do have to book well in advance.

Churrascaria, the brazillian steakhouse where as it's all you can eat meat from skewers of all sorts, and a cute little red for stop and green for go symbolic idol on the table to tell the servers when to stop with the protein feast.

From what I can tell between the dinner and brunch, the side buffet is definately different with eggs and pancakes and the like substituted for salad and stews.  But the meats are more or less the same, just with no filet mignon and higher beef cuts, but then, the number of meats are still outstanding when just off the fire pit.

I've enjoyed my meals, but I agree with fellow diners that the side salad/breakfast/dinner side buffet really isn't anything to write home about.  Also, the reason why I'm listing this as a 3 instead of a 3.5 to 4 star is that I find the $40/person dinner price just outrageously too much.

Still, I tend to feast when the lamb comes around, and my partner loves the roasted pineapple.  Great place to be for a celebratory special dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Very good! ... I enjoyed the salad bar and the wine was really good! The service was also very friendly and the meat was great! Nothing to complain!"}
{"text":"It's always a great time to eat here with friends. Yes it's expensive, but I think with the quality of food and the excellent salad bar, that's expected. They generally have about 10-12 different skewered meats that come around, which are all very tasty. I think my favorite has to be the hot wings, but the tenderloin comes a close second."}
{"text":"There's been a big craze for a while now on this Brazilian barbecue thing. There's a few different places that do it there's this place there's Gauchos Brazilian barbecue and there's a place downtown as well..  I went here cuz I thought okay I might as well give it a try and I had heard good things about this place. I am a fan of the whole concept of it I like the fact you can help yourself to Soup Salad side dishes in between the meat dishes but really you have to be careful you don't fill yourself up on the because the meat is where it's at.
The way they have it set you just sit at your table and they bring out various cuts of meats and you take what you want and say no to what you don't want and it will just keep coming until you are full is a great concept. It would be nice if sometimes they changed up their menu and had different cuts of meat but it's usually the same Fair. All in all the food is great amazing there's some things that I'm not a fan of but that's just a personal preference like the lamb and the sausage. But other than that it's a great place to take your significant other or on a date or even just for something new. I would definitely be going here again I've already been a couple times so it's definitely not an all-the-time thing more of a special occasion place.
The one thing I would definitely suggest Saving Room for and it's great in mid-course or as an afterthought is the barbecued pineapple it is so sweet and so yummy it is definitely great for cleaning your palate between a bunch of meat before you decide to start again it is just so yummy"}
{"text":"Bad experience the worst food i eat ever i been in Brazilian steak house before was nothing like that meat was raw uneatable the price was to much and the salad bar was really limited the only good thing about this restaurant is the staff really friendly thats all i do not recommend this restaurant to any one"}
{"text":"MEEEAAATTTTTTTT..*nom nom nom nom* 

..fast forward 2 hours....cold seats, hot sweats, MEAT SWEATS...face in hands..dyin..

Yup - welcome to my first experience at Bolero and a massive lesson in OVER INDULGENCE. I knew it would happen and I had others warn me - but once that juicy BBQ meat starts rolling by the tables...YOU.CANNOT.SAY.NO. It almost feels forbidden to say no.

Prior to jumping over to Chinook for a 10:30pm movie, 10 of us decided to try Bolero as it has tempted us for ages. We enter the cool, dark atmosphere to be seated quickly by a lovely host, followed by drink orders and an \"explanation\" of how this place works.

You can buy the 40$ \"all you can eat meat\", and a couple other items built for sissys and vegetarians..clearly we're here for the AYCE. We start with the \"salad bar\" which wasn't the most amazing looking bar. Scarce vegetables, weird vegetables, and a couple pots of \"cafeteria stews\". I barely picked anything to avoid spoiling the meat fiesta to begin.

The meat begins to arrive (we're told that there are 17 different skewers *gasp* \"17\" we all say), and the fun begins. Tenderloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon - seriously folks, wrapped in bacon, sirloin, fish, chicken, the kitchen sink, blueberry sugared grapefruit and of course the beloved PINEAPPLE. The pineapple was warm and cinnamoned (not a word), and a nice cleanser between too much meat. There were also ribs, sausage and lamb. Even taking a small portion of each, we couldn't try them all...stuffed to the top like a Christmas turkey. All of it was juicy, tender, bbqed, and delicious. One complaint is that a couple items came by 2, then 3 times before others even came once for us to try.

I believe they offered dessert, but seriously - ridiculous after the 18 cows the 10 of us ate in one sitting. 

Service was quite good and attentive, restaurant was very cool and casual, and pricing was awesome - 40$ for AYCE tenderloin..seriously deadly.

..off to the movie...*sweats begin*..regret sets in...how do I get out of the center row seat? - I'm stuck...suffer it out...eff."}
{"text":"Ever since I've disclosed my Argentinean past, people keep on advising me to check out different steak houses - claiming unheard of meat quality.

My first try in Calgary was \"Gaucho - Brazilian BBQ\". It made me laugh from the very beginning, as neither gauchos nor BBQ have anything to do with Brazil (well, except for its very southern part - but even there you'll be hard pressed to find a Gaucho, let alone the one who knows how to do pork ribs with some Texan sauce).

But I deviated.

Bolero was not claiming anything really silly, they were just using a rodizio model and cooking some fine meats. Once again I didn't understand why all you can eat BBQ was expensive as hell - but oh well. That's North America, not South.

So meat was very nicely cooked, sides were not that impressive, though ok, but... hey, they barely had a couple of different styles! In an actual Rodizio a challenge is in that there are so many different types of meat that you literally keep on trying until you are too full and can't move and have to quit - that's what it is about!

In Bolero I was bored way before I was full, and price tag was not making things any funnier. So well, at least I fill myself ok, but otherwise it was quite a disappointment. And those sternly looking servers, totally understanding their entitlement, were not even funny. Seriously, guys, even expensive, that's not Courchevel with a small Coke bottle worth $170, so no need to look so important - you can relax and smile for a change...

Between Bolero and Gaucho I would say that they both are not at all a Holy Grail for a serious meat eater. Growing from \"bbq\" to \"bife\" is not easy and they are well in the very beginning of that road.

But, if someone pays for you and you like good meat - just good, not exceptionally impossibly best in the world - you should not hesitate to visit the place."}
