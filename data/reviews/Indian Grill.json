{"text":"I'm so glad we tried this place. Some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted. Ever. The pakora I've ever tasted, so light and fluffy and packed with fresh veggies. Everything is seasoned so well and affordable to boot. I can't believe we haven't tried it sooner. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wandered in here after everywhere else on the strip was full. I will definitely be coming back! Our waiter was attentive and when we asked for a surprise dish he gave us tandoori chicken which ended up being everyone's favourite. Everything else was delicious as well and they even gave us free mango ice cream at the end! They deliver for free as well. More people need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, the service was great, and the price was reasonable.  Sit by the window so you can people watch. This place has a lot of traffic coming through with an ice cream place across the street (which has a mile long wait) that brings all kinds of people."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see that the overpriced, underwhelming Amaya branch on Ossington, near my home, had been replaced by an independent Indian restaurant. Even more excited to report that the staff are friendly and the food is great! My partner and I had the Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken and Onion  Bhaji. All were delicious, and refreshingly less rich than our Indian standby Banjara. We both give Indian Grill five stars and hope it's here to stay!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! Lovely staff! Nice environment! Had a lovely collection of dishes and appetizers that we shared as a group of four in the window table. Lovely evening."}
{"text":"We've been talking about this place for a while, and finally got delivery tonight - it was delicious! We had butter chicken, beef vindaloo, eggplant and one called chicken curry - they were all great - really like that you can order \"extra spicy\" as an option, even when ordering online. We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The saag paneer and the chicken korma were incredible! Went there for lunch today and I'm craving it already."}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian food I've had in Toronto! Their take out is very fast and reasonably priced. So tasty!!"}
{"text":"Génial. Nous avions un appartement dans mes environs et y sommes allés plus d'une fois (en salle et pour apporter). Le service était correcte et la nourriture était indescriptible. Nous avons pris végétarien: - Dalh curry (extra épicé); - Saag paneer. - Roti - Naan  Les quantités sont très généreuse. Un Dahl à deux peut être suffisant.  Total de 60$ pour deux, incluant pourboire, taxes et un demi-litre de vin.  Vous pouvez aussi commander en ligne et aller le chercher. Le système fonctionne très bien et vous sauver 10%."}
{"text":"The chicken in Madras Chicken was very dry. Dal Makhani was very watery and not flavourful at all.  The delivery time said 50 minutes, but it took additional 25 minutes for the food to show up. My stomach was upset for a day after having eaten the food from this place. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here and it was delicious. A pretty standard Order of butter chicken, biryani, aloo gobi and naan but it was fantastic. Best  we've had in a really long time. Got a side of hot pickle and it was bang on. My hubbie commented that if we put the food from the containers into serving dishes, it would pass as authentic homemade. Well done!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the neighbourhood, I was hoping to find a nice Indian-style restaurant. I tried Banjara and found it to be lacking, so I was glad when I noticed Indian Grill on Ossington.  Indian Grill is a smaller and modestly-decorated Indian-style restaurant, with good service, good food, and a relaxed atmosphere. Our server was very accommodating, offering to separate tables so we could sit by the front where the floor-to-ceiling window opens--fully being able to enjoy the evening breeze while watching everyone go by. He was always very quick to refill our water, brought our dishes in good time, and was very friendly.  The wine and drinks menu is generous, and the dinner menu had just enough selection so as not to be overwhelming. My only request about the menus is that portion sizes be added. We ended up ordering much more food than we had intended; we could have done with one order of samosas which comes with two, but the menu said \"samosa\" so we ordered one each, and we asked for an order of rice each, while one would probably feed about three people. Of course, what we did order was delicious (the samosas had great flavour, but were salted too much on the outside). I highly recommend the chicken bhoona and Kashmiri naan!  Overall, I will definitely be going back to Indian Grill. The sign outside says they offer free delivery, so I'll be sure to take advantage of that as well. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food you'll find in the GTA. For what's it's worth, I am a second generation Indian person who has lived here her entire life. I've eaten my fair share of Indian food all over the city and this place by far has the most delicious food you can find ...it is however second to my mother :p.   Their quality of customer service here is also exceptional. Before ordering, our server was kind enough to inform us that we would be waiting for our food longer then most places.  But rest assured, it's well worth the wait because everything is  so delicious and freshly prepared for you. You can also order their food online and get it delivered if you are not in the mood to sit down in this lovely quant restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited with my partner and we had an exceptional meal for a very reasonable price. We started with the appetizer platter which feature the best chicken pakoras I have ever had. The tandoori chicken is cooked fresh to order for every customer so it takes about 20 minute shut well worth it for the quality. We also tried the Chana masala which was top notch.  Food incredible   Service excellent and friendly  Atmosphere so-so but go for the food!"}
{"text":"Quickly found one night on yelp - Great food, amazing garlic naan and saag paneer. Lassi's were delicious too."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves the 5 star rating it has. I came here for the first time last week and I plan to come back many times. The service was great and the food was so delicious; and a great price as well :) The garlic naan is delicious and the Chana masala is the best I've had :)"}
{"text":"Great food here. Extremely flavourful without being sickly salty. The curries are delicious and rich, but not super-oily like some places.  We had the platter (everything here was top notch, chicken pakora, veg pakora, onion bhajia), Chicken Vindaloo (well-spiced, strong pickle flavour, SO good), and mutter paneer (equally as good as everything else). The naan was fresh and tasty as well.  Prompt and friendly service and very reasonable prices made this a perfect indian dining experience, would highly recommend. I'm already planning to go back for a group birthday dinner in a week."}
{"text":"We received a free plate of pappadums (lentil crisps) as soon as sat down which were very nice and crispy.   We ordered onion bhaji (onion pieces dipped in a chickpea flour batter and Indian spices and deep fried) as our starter. They were bland and dry (salt was missing). The two chutneys that came with were flavourful and helped the dish tremendously.   For mains, we shared three dishes family-style between 5 people and there was enough food. We ordered Paneer Tawa Masala, Eggplant Bharta and Daal curry.   Paneer Tawa Masala Dish is paneer (Indian cheese) cooked with vegetables in a tomato-y and slightly sweet and spicy gravy. I thought it was very tasty.   Eggplant Bharta is roasted and mashed eggplant with spices. I found the eggplant flavourful but a little too (chilli) hot for me.  We had asked for all dishes to be prepared medium-hot but this one was the only one that was hot, and too hot at that.   Daal curry is a thick yellow lentil \"soup\" that we eat with bread and rice. It was way too salty in my opinion.   The garlic naan was very good, buttery and garlicky and the onion kulcha was bland.    Overall, some hits and some misses. I will be back when I want Indian food in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We reserved for a party of 6, including 2 kids, for a Saturday dinner. Attentive and quick service; great food. Ordered a variety of dishes and left feeling satisfied, for a very reasonable price. Small, no frills place; we felt comfortable and enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Hankering for some Indian, we of course checked Yelp for some local recommendations and found Indian Grill. We weren't disappointed! Everything was delicious. Ordered the lamb madras (three stars spicy) and the tandoori chicken. Pleasantly surprised at how moist the chicken was. We thought the lamb would be more spicy, so we may try four stars spicy (the max) next time. Definitely will come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Very authentic Indian food and incredible service. The space probably could fit 20-25 people. Servers were super helpful and friendly. You can adjust the spiciness of your food and I would suggest (if you come with friends) it is the best to shard dishes. We tried their mutton (lamb), fish masala, butter chicken, butter paneer, and palak paneer... All of them are amazing! For the price, we had 10 people and it turns out to be around 20 bucks per person. So glad we found this place! Will definitely love to return and recommend to more friends"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic and consistent!    My favs include onion bhaji, lamb saag and chicken kadai -  I was also impressed that it wasn't greasy like some of the other places I have been.    As someone who grew up on Indian cuisine - I recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Went with 3 friends.  We all agreed 5/5.  Finally getting the bill took a while but the food was really good."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and was very impressed with the food. We ordered the butter chicken, vegetarian daal, roti and rice. Everything was hot, flavourful and served in good portions. Good butter chicken here. Our roti was a little over cooked, so they replaced it right away with no questions asked.   The restaurant itself is quaint with not a ton of seating. It was busy! But not too busy that we couldn't get a table. Seemed to be very busy with takeout orders as well.  It's probably not going to be my #1 favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto, but it's gotta be a top contender and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, something has changed and the food in recent weeks has drastically declined. Both butter chicken & samosas were off.  Butter chicken was of watery consistency, not creamy, and tasteless...chicken also appeared to be cooked differently.  The samosas did not taste fresh and had to abort eating them to avoid getting sick later.  Also, found a thick hair in the butter chicken."}
{"text":"Come for lunch for exceptional prices! This place serves up really good Indian food. My boyfriend who lived in India definitely approves. The naan is perfect, and the meal itself is not oily like other restaurants we've been too, and does not overkill on the masala.  The restaurant is quite nice with black and red decor, and candles on the table for a romantic dinner.  They also do take-out and delivery!"}
{"text":"Best butter chicken and tandori chicken ive tried in the city. It takes a little longer than usual to cook but its worth every minute for the quality."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on New Year's Day with my family. The good was great and the staff is friendly.   We enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered. Everything was served hot and tasty.   Vegetable korma Saag Paneer  Butter chicken Lamb vindaloo Eggplant Bharta Nann and rice"}
{"text":"Not much experience with Indian cuisine and went in for lunch just to try Indian foods. Overall food tasted great, recommend this place for any Indian food first timer. I gave a 3 star because the lunch menu was very misleading. We were billed for twice as much than what we should've been charged for lunch special because we ordered some foods a la carte instead of a part of lunch specials. I mean, the owner lady who took the order obviously knew it was our first time trying Indian food and we were tourists (because we told her), she could have simply guided us to order more efficiently and economically but she did not say a thing. We felt a little cheated when we picked up the bill. Food was great tho."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place bc of the great reviews.  The butter chicken my Bf got was gross. but he liked it, it was ketchupy.  the Lamb Saag was... meh. Runny. and there was plastic in it.  The Naan was soggy AND burnt... annoying.  The Peas Paloa was lovely! And the appetizer platter was good - too many greasy options, which there had been more fresh items in the platter.  Took 2 hrs to arrive. Will not be ordering from here for a good while, though it is the best Indian I have had in the Parkdale area SO far. However the price is great for the value. Wonderful phone manners btw!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, Authentic North Indian cuisine.  It was truly a party in my mouth!"}
{"text":"First off, the menu was complete but not overwhelming.  The online order application seamless and intuitive, even for this Luddite.  Food arrived on time, hot and in sturdy, drip proof containers.  I ordered dishes spiced 'medium'  which turned out to be precisely to personal taste, though I would not fear a step higher in the sense of adventure next time out.  Butter Chicken and Beef Vindalo were served in ample sauces that held bound completely together, even after sitting for a while. none of the tell-tale grease slicks left behind by inferior sauciers. Meats were tender, substantial,  and obviously the good bits, no gristle or fat. Overall well prepared and presented, friendly and polite service (we called to set the order back an hour, \"No problem sir\") and a cheerful driver at the door. Will recommend and return. Just lovely."}
{"text":"Indian Grill is a solid option for home cooked Indian food amidst the Ossington restaurant strip. They opened recently, but the food clearly has years of development and passion that's been poured into it.  The chef's appetizer platter was huge and a great value.  Great service and vibe all around."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place on Ossington for a Friday night and walked past this place and did not regret this decision at all. First glance it wasn't super busy like the rest of the block. We ordered butter chicken, saffron rice, naan bread, chicken mirch tikka, mixed max tarkari. Everything was delicious! The butter chicken we got it extra spicy and it was fantastic. The service was great too. Highly recommended to anyone looking for something less busy and not your typical restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Great Food!  Ordered Dahl, Paneer, Rice & Garlic Naan and you couldn't ask for more. Some of the best Indian food I've had at a restaurant. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We tried butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, saag paneer (palak paneer), naan and rice. All of them taste just excellent and portions are enough for four people. Specifically, its garlic naan is very impressive - crispy and savoury. Food is served on time and the price is reasonable. Our server was very polite and friendly as well. I'll definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while, and finally did a delivery order with a friend. My biggest disappointment in the experience, is in my friend for not wanting to order anything spicy. My personal highlights included the deep fried veggie pakoras and the Rogan Josh lamb.  Prices seemed competitive, delivery was pretty quick, and I'm willing to order from here again (with spicier food chosen), so 4 stars seems about right."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch here on a weekday, ordered Saag Paneer & Eggplant Bharta both are really good. 7.95$ each was lunch special deal. Portion serves 1 person. Quite filling though. Garlic Naan was good too. Curries are rich and flavourful. Friendly service and clean restaurant. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"For 27$, we shared a chicken korma, rice and had a naan bread each! You could hardly cook a meal for two for that price in Toronto! I am about to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Such amazing food! Definitely worth a try if you love Indian cuisine . The portions and prices were  great for two people!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Loads of vegetarian options, obviously, plus the Tandoori meats were very good. Meat is a tad expensive, but the ambience and service are much better than average so I don't mind."}
{"text":"My regular Indian spot!  They always have consistently good food.  The naan bread is amazing here!  The prices and portions are great - I usually have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Nice atmosphere inside as well, always clean and the staff is courteous. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! Easily one of the best in the west end. I've tried the saag paneer, lamb korma, and butter chicken. All are excellent, and portions are quite large. The restaurant is quite new, so they still have a few kinks to iron out, but they seem to be improving and adding new things daily. There's now a lunch menu, for instance, which will probably keep me coming back quite regularly. The people are very nice too!  All in all, it's a massive improvement from Amaya express that was in the space before!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Great food, great service.  I ordered the lamb vindaloo. Nice spice to it. Lamb didn't have that funny aftertaste, which made it feel like I was eating beef. It was good! (Some people like lamb for that after taste but I personally don't give two shits). Protein.   Friend ordered the saag paneer (the green mushy spinach curry dip kind of thing) - which I loved and the chicken Tika ...uhh forgot the name.  Loved it.  Wife ordered the buttered chicken - was good. On the sweeter side.  Garlic naan.  Delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Indian food at a restaurant and I loved it. We were there for lunch. The portions seemed small at first but were just enough to fill you up because of the fact that the sauces were heavy and we ordered rice and naan. We ordered Chicken Korma and one more meal but I forgot the name of it. Both were delicious. Customer service level was really good. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We had the chicken vindaloo, matar paneer, and the lamb biryani. All fantastic!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  I always pass by and have been wanting to check it out and let me tell you I'm beyond happy I did.  I was impressed by all aspects of the place.  From the politeness and delicateness of the waiters (who I believe are the owners), the presentation of the dishes and quality of food!  The food was probably some of the best Indian I have had at a restaurant.  You can really tell everything is authentic, fresh and hand prepared.    I have gone back multiple times and have had the same pleasant experience each time!"}
{"text":"Great Indian place if you're in the area! Food is fairly priced and very tasty! I usually get the lamb vindaloo and eggplant bharta. So rich and savory. The naan is very good as well. Lots of places around to roam afterwards."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend afternoon. The place wasn't too packed.   We ordered the Chicken Mirch Tikka , naan and butter chicken. During our wait, they offered us some papadum and two dips while we were waited. The dips are tasty and a good starter before we start our meal.  Our favourite is the chicken Mirch TIkka. It is so juicy and moist.  The butter chicken is a bit too dry. But the curry itself is good.  So we kind of combing the meat from mirch tikka dish with our naan together.  We will come back as It is our second/ third favourite Indian restaurant in GTA."}
{"text":"The vegetable samosas came out still frozen inside. The service was terribly slow. We waited for 25 minutes to get our appetizers. When the food did come, it was good. We ordered 4 dishes and they were all decent but the whole experience was poor. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"If you have hours to spare and are not hungry this is the place for you! Food here is great. We had butter chicken and lamb korma  along with samosas as well as rice and breads. Tastes fresh and authentic. First time we ordered delivery it was slow but this time was outrageous. We had to wait 2 HOURS for the food to arrive. Eating at 10 pm at night is not ideal! Upon ringing the restaurant I was told the delay was due to them only having one card machine (insane in any restaurant let alone on a busy Saturday night). I was told during that call the food would be another 15 minutes.  Had to wait another 45 minutes from there. When it FINALLY arrived the delivery man had the nerve to put an automatic tip on the machine even after I said I wouldn't be giving one..he then ignored me and did it anyway. I then had to tell him again. Fancy expecting a tip..how about after making your customer wait 2 hours you offer some compensation but no. Nothing. Such a shame as the food is good. Will not be returning again!"}
{"text":"If you are walking down Ossington Avenue trying to find this place, just close your eyes and follow your nose. You can smell delicious spices from a city block away. Like many Indian restaurants, the portions are huge. We ordered an extra spicy chicken tikka marsala with rice and garlic naan. The service was very friendly, and even though a very large party was keeping our server busy, she still made time for our little table."}
{"text":"5 star service and food. Ordered delivery and u like other \"ethnic\" restaurants the person answering understood me perfectly and got the order done promptly. In exactly 1 hour my food was delivered by a very friendly and polite person. Food was hot, fresh, and delicately flavoured. Had butter chicken, the okra, starter platter, and saffron rice. All were amazing. Def one of the best Indian places in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't busy at all. After our meal, I couldn't imagine why. Maybe it was an off night? But the meals were excellent. Had the chicken jalfrezee and the lamb saag and both were excellent. Portions looked small, but two dishes were more than enough to share with one other person. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I would say the best in Toronto. I have only got delivery but I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"As a brown man, I am very picky when it comes to Indian food having been spoiled by my mum's authentic cooking. I have not come across a restaurant in the 6ix that met my high standards until one day I discovered Indian Grill on the Foodora app. Hands down the most flavourful and authentic Indian in the city. The ingredients seem to be of higher quality than most Indian restaurants and I have been ordering on a weekly basis. The chicken pakoras, seekh kabab and tandoori chicken are my faves. My only complaint would be that the onion bhaji/vegetable pakora platter is somewhat greasy and underwhelming compared to the rest of the menu. If Indian Grill could improve these dishes I would rate this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had the chefs appetizer platter which was great value - included 4 different appies which was great because i love variety. Also had the goat biryani and lamb curry. Both were super tasty - especially the lamb curry! Also - best garlic naan in the city. Definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"So cheap! So good! So fast! Ordered lunch for three via Uber Eats and $36 dollars and 30 mins later we were chowing down on Indian Grill's perfectly spiced eats. Everything we ordered (butter chicken, mutter paneer, dahl makhni, rice, and naan) was tasty and filling. I was particularly happy with the dahl because it does not come with cilantro! As one of those people whose genetics have cursed them to taste cilantro as a metallic soapy nightmare, dahl can be rife with uncertainty. Will my otherwise delicious time be ruined by the *other* devil's lettuce? Not today satan, this dahl is not for you. Its for me to scarf till its gone, and with lots of naan because yum this place makes the good kind."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Indian Grill never having tried it before because our usual go to Indian place wasn't taking any calls. We liked the menu because had enough options to satisfy all our cravings. We ordered some bhajis, garlic naan, the beef with spinach and a fish curry. While it took awhile for delivery we were pleased with the quality of the food when it arrived. Everything was tasty giving us a new go to place for Indian food on those nights when you just don't want to venture out"}
{"text":"Did I just have a five star lunch? I did, I did! Go me, go me...  It's pretty rare that I give a delivery lunch a full five stars, but Indian Grill is incredible. Well balanced flavours, true to their listed spice levels, and most importantly, very reasonably priced!   We had lunch for three and it came to $36 including UberEats fees, taxes and tip. Seriously, I can't get over how good of a deal this is, normally Indian delivery topples $60 pretty quickly. We had naan, rice, mutter paneer, butter chicken and dahl makhani. Everything was really on point, but the butter chicken was the star. Creamy yet spicy. Get it, get it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The samosas in particular are fantastic, and so is the saag paneer.  The place is small, but friendly staff. I usually order takeout, and definitely recommend this place for those who want delicious Indian food in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while as the reviews are really good, and I've mostly been underwhelmed by my Indian food dining experiences in Toronto. Granted, I have not made the effort to eat out much in Little India, so maybe I've missed out on some gems, but most of the places I've been too elsewhere in the city have been okay - not horrible but nothing for me to get excited over.  So, today I decided to try out Indian Grill, and finally I have found an Indian restaurant that is close to home AND that I would very happily go back to. I got take out - samosas, chicken korma, steamed basmati rice and laccha paratha. Everything was delicious!  The chicken korma particularly got my attention as it was rich and creamy while still having a delicate flavour. I am very judgemental about samosas and this one passed my test. I can only imagine how wonderful they are straight out of the fryer. The long walk home reduced the crispiness of the shell a little bit, but not too much.    The ONLY reason I've knocked off a star was because I'm pretty sure the lachha paratha I ordered turned out to be whole wheat naan, which I only discovered after I got home."}
