{"text":"Club Espagnol is great. Especially in the summer because their terrace is enormous and sunny (or parasols for the shade-lovers). The service is great and friendly, the atmosphere is comfortable and animated. The beer and sangria are reasonably priced and the food is also very very tasty. They serve spanish tapas which are all very reasonably portioned for the price. Try their paella or the chorizo. Or the snails soaking in garlic butter. Or the squid in ink. This restaurant is all about the bread-sauce-absorption. The eggplant gratin is also fantastic and the cod accras are crispy and light, served with lemon. You do need a 25$/year membership to be allowed to purchase alcohol (government licensing regulations), but are allowed bringing up to five guests with your membership so it's not such a big deal."}
{"text":"My paella was burnt and soupy. When I informed the manager she told me and my party to Google it because that is how it is supposed to be. I have had paella before and I know that is not how it is supposed to be! My friend also had paella and none of her rice was sticking to the pan, which I pointed out. My other friend never got her food, the waiter said he dropped it on the floor and it would be 15 minutes. Fast forward 40 minutes later and still no food. They didn't even offer her an appetizer while she waited. Our whole experience took two hours. We cancelled the missing order and left. The manager seemed preoccupied sitting and talking with what we think were regulars while her one waiter worked frantically. Also there were five kids that ran around screaming/playing while we we were eating. I believe they were family members of the staff. We paid for the burnt paella, they never offered to fix it. Please do not go here."}
{"text":"Went to try it out since missed out on the last visit to the area ( had ended up at another place down the street which was good but more expensive) we had 2x 1/2 ltrs of sangria very good and had omelette, chorizo, fried calmar, garlic shrimp, and pork with peppers and all were so tasty. service is very friendly and the prices are great! if you want alcohol you do need to get a membership card for $25 and good for 1 yr. so will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Hardly anyone knows about this place but it's one of the best Spanish tapas place around.  It's the Spanish Social Club of Quebec.  Located on the second floor of a non-descript building on the busy streets of St. Laurent; the decor is very, shall we say, practical.  The place is huge so it can host a really large group; or several of them; and they have the largest outdoor patio around.

The menu is wonderful.  I imagine that if I had a Spanish mum, I would eat like that all the time.  They have wonderful mussels and calamari and their potato salad is the best potato salad I've ever eaten.  I don't even want to talk to you about the price because you can eat like a king and not have to crack into your royal treasury to pay for desert.  I don't want to talk about their sangria because it makes me want to cry.

Bear in mind that you'll feel like you're in a community centre but if you happen upon this place in the summer, go to their outdoor patio!  Try their sangria and eat like a Spanish king at a community centre!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, food was burnt!!!! While I NEVER received my food after being told that it would take another 15 min(after waiting 45min) because the waiter dropped my order. My friend informed the manager that her paella was burnt and was told that is how it's suppose to be. The manager went on to state that she must've never been to Spain and that she should check the internet cause that's how its suppose to be. We found this to be very rude and for experienced travelers as ourselves we've been to Spain several times and know how paella should look and burnt isn't it. Which neither here nor there relevant when a customer is unhappy. To top it off while we were waiting for dinner there was 5-6 kids running around the restaurant playing and screaming knocking over chairs. Clearly the kids were members of the staffs family and making the evening even worse.  DON'T GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere..sangrilla is ok not too strong though..terrace is nice and fast service.. Live music is cool"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé deux fois pendant la Coupe du monde 2010 et l'ambiance y était électrique. Le lieu en tant que tel n'est pas très invitant (cela fait grande cafétéria en haut et cuisine communautaire en bas), mais le service est cordial et on peut goûter à des plats typiquement espagnols. Ma seule déception côté bouffe aura été d'avoir commis l'erreur de prendre un plat dont je me souvenais du nom pour y avoir goûté en Espagne, mais que j'avais alors détesté (comme quoi, parfois, des noms nous restent en tête pour de mauvaises raisons). Mais cela ne m'a pas empêché d'essayer d'autres plats qui, eux, étaient délicieux. Ma suggestion est d'y aller cet été quand les Espagnols participeront à l'EURO 2012. Ambiance garantie."}
{"text":"To be honest, we weren't able to order anything. I was on the look on google for the best sangria in town and found this place. ACtually, it was another restaurant but i opted for this one. We came in and we were seated. The first thing the guy said was, ifyou're going to order we are having problems in the kitchen right now, so it will take some time. I said, oh no worries we'll start with the alcohol. 

Seated we are. WE waited probably 15-20 mins before the lady came and gave her service and to our demise, we are not allowed to order unless we are members. We all left. One, they lost money. Second, they lost a probable comeback from a happy customer. 

It was our first time to hear about membership ballony. Why would we register if we aren't even sure if food and service is that great. 25$ of membership fee. HAHAHA! the best joke i ever heard."}
{"text":"La place est fort agréable pour sa terrasse l'été, la sangria et les calmars frits sont délicieux. Je dois avouer que la salle à manger à l'intérieur ressemble à une vieille salle de Bingo, très étroit."}
{"text":"Une des terrasses les moins connues de montréal et elles sont rares!!

La bouffe est correcte. Certains plats style gros tapas sont bien d'autre moyens... Mais la terrasse est top, la sangrilla est bonne et il n'y a pas de taxes! Puisque c'est un club social.

Ne vous fiez pas a la salle intérieure communautaire. Il faut aller jusqu'a l'arriere ou la terrasse se situe. Par beau temps seulement."}
{"text":"On m'avait recommandé l'endroit pour la paella et nous avons vraiment été déçus. Petite portion et assez fade.  Par contre, j'ai adoré les calmars frits.

C'est un club social et le permis d'alcool est pour les membres uniquement. À 25$ la carte annuelle, pour une visite unique, on laisse tomber alors pas de sangria pour nous sur la terrasse. 

Personnel très sympa mais ça reste une grosse déception. Il nous faudra retourner en Espagne pour la vraie affaire!"}
{"text":"Partir en Espagne sans quitter Montréal ? C'est possible !

Ambiance :
Mon chum voulait un endroit pour voir la finale de Champions League avec l'animation qui va bien, et moi je voulais bien manger et profiter du soleil... Done !
Une immense salle avec des longues tables (et des écrans), une petites terrasse avec plein de petites tables, qui donne sur une cour calme. Et tout ça avec des gens de tous les âges qui parlent Espagnol haut et fort (comme là-bas quoi !).

Repas :
Une sangria... vraiment bonne ! Et bien fraiche !! 
Plein de petits plats tous excellents ! Avec une préférence pour les calamars à l'encre et l'assiette charcuteries&fromages.

Conclusion :
On a trouvé l'endroit où aller voir les matchs de l'Espagne pendant la Copa do Mundo !"}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of restaurant that you wouldn't know it exists unless you are a Spanish expat or a review reader. This restaurant is in a community center. When you go through the door on St-Laurent Street, you have to go your right, climb the stairs and take the door to your left. 

The decoration is very average, but it does not really matter. What is really cool about this place is that you have a mix of Montrealers and Spanish expats. I was also super excited to speak Spanish to the waiters since I hadn't spoken the language in months.

We arrived at the restaurant around 6PM and asked for a table on the terrace. The restaurant was quite empty. We ordered 2 paellas (seafood and valenciana), boquerones and 1 litre of their sangria. 

The good: The seafood paella was okay. Although, it was not like the ones I ate in Spain (where I lived for 2 months) - because they don't have access to the same products - I still liked it. It was saltier than I expected. 

The boquerones were delicious. I could have eaten more. The sangria is also very good. It does not have too much sugar. They have a great selection of tapas to choose from. Actually, next time I go, I might just order tapas and sangria. 

The bad: The service was particularly slow until the rush hour came (around 7PM). I think until then there was only one waiter. 

Also: CASH ONLY. They have an ATM in the restaurant, but we all know how much they charge ridiculous fees. 

Total: $71 without the tip (20-something for both paella, $10 for the boquerones and the rest for the Sangria)

Conclusion: I will definitely go back whenever I crave Spanish food and boquerones. It will be THE place to go to for World Cup games next year. Vamos Espana!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The paella was delicious and so was the chorizo. The atmosphere wasn't the best. It's in a member's club so we ate at folding tables. Big thing to keep in mind is that you cannot be served alcohol unless you are a member, which is $25/year."}
{"text":"La terasse est un bon dépaysement,  on s'y croirait. Tout y est très bon et sans prétention qu ce soit la sangria, les calamars, les gambas pil pil.... Mmm!! Partir en Espagne sans quitter Montréal: c'est vraiment ça. Les prix sont plus que corrects et le service impeccable. Par contre quand il fait plus froid et que la terasse est fermée,  l'endroit perd tout son charme.  Dommage qu'ils ne servent pas de la pata negra"}
{"text":"This is so retro real , almost a surreal feel.Excellent authentic  Spanish cuisine :.fish stew, grilled sardines,gambas,all delivered.Sangria failed the test of memoried time. Slower friendly service."}
{"text":"Very authentic restaurant, if you feel like experiencing something different, you should definitely go! It's like you're actually in another country... Who knew a little staircase could change the whole vibe? 
The people there are probably usuals, but it gives you this cozy feeling; like you're in a family, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic paella for half the price you'll get anywhere else! Cozy atmosphere & nice terrace."}
{"text":"Great place for tapas. Had the chorizo and potato tapas. It was really good and the price was right. Had the paella de mariscos  that comes with lobster, shrimps and more sea food. Really good stuff.

Must go for the price!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurent n'en est pas un. C'est en fait un club social (25$ la carte de membre annuelle et fiche à remplir) qui ne peut servir de l'alcool qu'à ses membres alors prévoyez une certaine attente avant de savourez votre premier verre de la soirée!!. La terrasse est superbe au coucher du soleil. La nourriture excellente. L'ambiance aussi mais le service....on aimerais sentir qu'on ne vous dérange pas!

Je vais quand même y retourner pour ressayer."}
{"text":"Very decent tapas with a lively atmosphere on a 2nd floor deck overlooking a parking lot and apartments. Good selection of tapas. Good size servings. Pass the hat entertainment.
This is a great place for big or small groups. None of the food disappointed and the bill was very reasonable.
Easy to fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"L'été, leur terrasse est un «must» à Montréal avec des tapas et de la sangria. L'hiver, on mange dans la salle principale, menu abordable et traditionnelle (paella, bacalao, rib steak,  ...)  service courtois mais un peu lent par contre, parfait pour les groupes, ils ont des spectacles de flamenco certains jours."}
{"text":"Juste 5 étoiles, avec plaisir. Une terrasse magnifique et sans prétention à quelques lieues du Centre-ville ! 

Vraiment y'a rien de plus à dire. Ah ben la pieuvre est délicieuse! Mais bon faites juste y aller."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially in summer when you can enjoy their lovely terrace. 
The food: great!
The service: lovely!
The location: nice!
I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends, it's a great place to spend a nice Sunday afternoon drinking sangria and enjoying tapas in good company."}
{"text":"If you hate garlic, then don't come here.
However if you don't, then come here as often as you can, plus this is the place to go for the best sangria in Montreal, hands down!

I love Club Espagnol for a variety of reasons, the sangria is one, the live flamenco shows are another, the gentle family atmosphere, the great terrasse out back and lively crowd all make this place work. 

Oh yes, then there is the food. Tapas of all sorts: shrimp, calamari, octopus, chorizo sausage, all of it served in garlicky,  bread-moppable glory. Spanish ham, cheeses, salads, garlic potatoes and mushrooms, soups, and salads. Mains here include rabbit and many variations of paella. While walking by some tables, the paella plates were positively delicious looking, all the saffron-colored rice, huge shrimp, mussels and chunks of sausage and ham all in full view. Prices are also very reasonable.

I love the way families are usually here as well as younger couples, and groups of friends, all sharing the same space. I was here last week with a friend for dinner and some small girls were playing behind us when one of their balloons deflated and flew around before landing right in the middle of our table (not on any food) we both burst out laughing and so did the girls, it's the kind of place where stuff like that happens and it's fine.

Try to come here at least once in the summer, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I had read on Yelp that this was THE place for authentic paella in Montreal. We skipped all the fancy Montreal restaurants and walked up the stairs of this local Spanish club. Unbeknownst to us, it's not a public restaurant, but rather a fraternity-type organization, where members pay dues, etc. We were allowed to eat dinner, but not order alcoholic beverages, which meant I had a glass of water with my lovely paella. It was not the best I've ever had, it was a dingy location (imagine your sadder Elks lodges), and the waiter ignored us, probably because we're not regulars.

First time a Yelp search steered me so wrong."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try Spanish cuisine in a very tipica fashion.  The decor is very laid back, this is a social club, which by definition at least on the plateau, means a place where Spanish family and friends get together to have home cooked meals.

I have been a few times and have always gone with parties of 4 or more, which is the best way in my opinion because you can order several different choices and try new things each time.  

This prices are very inexpensive and the atmosphere is lively, we have tried almost everything on their menu, and have often taken their specials (which is always recommended in this type of place), the only thing we did not like was the Paella which was a little to dry and not as tasty as we hoped, but other than that you will hardly ever go wrong, and who know maybe we just got a bad batch.  

Everything else has always met and surpassed our expectations, and the wait staff is friendly and laid back, so go there in the spirit of a leisurely meal with friends to be social  (it is a social club after all), and you too will be charmed.


By the way on one occasion we discovered their amazing outdoor terrace, (it was kinda raining so we only stayed for one drink), but I can see this being a summer place to eat AL fresco in the future."}
