{"text":"Sometime aftter I started working downtown, the stars aligned and I stumbled upon Mio. This cute little coffee/breakfast/lunch express spot is worth the trip to Scotiaplaza, even if you've got to explore the PATH a little to get there.

I'm more of a latte girl, but I am in love with their drip coffee (which says a lot). It's IIly coffee - huge win for coffee lovers out there who can't bring themselves to drink the office \"coffee\". They also offer 'stamp cards' for frequent buyers - Buy 6 coffees, get one free!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Visited with a friend and enjoyed quick, friendly service in an upscale, yet comfortably casual environment. Calamari or 'fritto misto' was well worth the price because the portion was ample and came with a few shrimp as well. I guess that's where misto comes in. The sauce was advertised as spicy but I did not find it so (damn SE Asian genes!) Tasty nevertheless.

We were offered sparkling or still, to which we promptly responded 'tap is good'. The negroni was delicious and not too bitter. A bit reddish and garnished with an orange peel. My friend had the classic 3 oz martini which he didn't complain about (but then again, he's easily pleased). They also had a $5 special on Beau's for those who care to know. 

In looking at some of the other reviews, it is important to note that the breakfast place next door appears to have different staff so I hope this helps to clear up any 'should I shouldn't I' concerns. We also probably received good service because we were having an extremely late lunch so there weren't a ton of other tables to be waited on. 

Candies on the way out were a nice, standard touch. A major plus about this place is its location in the path, meaning no coats required if you're having lunch in the winter. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Simple lunch spot in the PATH. I went for a business lunch and it was decent. There were certainly nice options that appeared on the menu. I chose the simple margherita pizza. I like to choose that style of pizza at Italian restaurants with thin crust pizza to compare them. The crust on this one was too big and it wasn't served hot enough. The pieces of mozzarella were a little too thick and there wasn't enough basil. The sauce was very tasty though. And the chili oil they gave on the side was also tasty. My lunch colleague got the lunch special and she enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings here. My dinner - the mushroom pizza was delicious, worthy of 4 stars. Service was slow despite the place being empty on a Wednesday evening. The beer was terrible, really tasted watered down or bottom of the keg. I tried two different brands and both were the same. Food great, everything else poor."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times for breakfast and never been disappointed. Their breakfast sandwiches are amazing. Also the breakfast quesadilla is unique and excellent tasting (hint of basil and garlic). They serve illy coffee (fresh, hot and done right), with which you can never go wrong!

Last but not the least the staff there is very pleasant and consistently so. Having visited this place for breakfast a few hundred times over the years, i have never had a bad experience, so i was quite surprised when i saw a couple of customers posting on yelp with burnt sandwhich pictures and complaining about the staff.  Heads up to such people though that this is not a Tim Hortons that will supply you with everything bagel type crap. It is an authentic italian place serving real food."}
{"text":"Came in to redeem my coupon today as PathDeals.com had a deal for $10 for 5 Small Lattés.  Mio RistoBar is located in the Scotia Bank Plaza on King Street.  There is a sit down restaurant as well as an express café that sells sandwiches, coffees, fruit cups, etc.  It should be noted that they use Illy coffee, which is a personal favourite of mine.  

My coupon was for the Express Café.  I walked up to the counter and redeemed my coupon, and unlike other businesses who are featured and doing promotions on these \"Deal of the Day\" websites, mine was accepted with a smile.  I have no complaints about my latté but have had better elsewhere.  Next time I'll have to go back and try their food items."}
{"text":"I always have a great meal at Mio. The decor is a touch dated but the food is good, simple Italian and I've never had a bad experience there. Attentive service and reasonably priced wine list. Mio is a highly underrated restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited with a co-worker on a Friday morning around 9:30 AM for convenience sake, as we work just steps away. I've admittedly normally dismissed this place thinking it was nothing special, but I'm so glad we gave it a chance. I treated my co-worker to breakfast and we ordered: a) a breakfast sandwich and a medium coffee for him, and b) a banana muffin and a small cafe au lait for myself. For two people, I paid $11.99 total, taxes in.

This muffin - wow. I wasn't expecting much, but I was actually surprised at how positively wonderful my muffin was. It was moist, fresh, and full of flavour - the banana muffin actually tasted like real bananas, none of that artificial flavouring stuff, imagine that. This was the kind of light breakfast, together with my cafe au lait, that epitomized comfort. While the cafe au lait may taste a little straight and boring at first, give it a second, and you'll start to realize that the smoothness and consistency is part of its calming, wonderful, tasty appeal. I'll definitely be back (to try their other types of muffins, of course)!"}
{"text":"Went to mio to grab breakfast with a coworker this morning to witness terrible service. This is not how I want to start off my day at all.

I think i was being served by a manager or owner because they did not care at all about customer service and looked like they didnt want to be there. I asked for a croissant breakfast sandwich and she took a glimpse around the counter and said there was none and when I asked for whole wheat, she found a burnt piece of toast/croissant. I ordered eggs,ham, arugula,and tomato, and she had to keep asking me as if she didn't know what was on the menu. She forgot the ham. I expressed that I don't eat parsley and the egg was precooked with it (it doesn't matter if you don't see parsley in it, as long as its cooked with it the taste will linger. )

Every time I expressed concern or questioned the menu. Her response was \"this is how we do it here\"

 If they weren't serving illy coffee, I would never come back again. Definitely do not recommend this resto for breakfast"}
{"text":"Have always had decent food at MIO, last week they started a new menu so our lunch too longer than we expected. Staff acknowledged the issue, apologized and compensated appropriately. 
I would say fairly reasonably priced for a prime real estate local. I think you could easily have poorer qualify food and pay more. I've eaten here a few times, It's always busy, so they must be doing something well."}
{"text":"BEST muffins in the PATH.

Mio uses real fruit and they bake 'em fresh daily! Five flavours to choose from: apple (#1), banana (#2), carrot, blueberry and cranberry, and every one of them delectable. The muffin is crunchy on the outside, soft and moist and fluffy on the inside. So full of flavour. A delightful treat.

Eyeing those loaves too? Try 'em! They're also delicious.

Note: This review only pertains to their baked goods (muffins, loaves). Having read the Yelp reviews on their regular food, I've skipped that entirely."}
{"text":"I come to Mio Express regularly for my morning drink to get my day started.

My favourite breakfast item is the english muffin breakfast. It is filling, delicious and non greasy. Their scrambled egg is well cooked, and topped with spinach, melting cheese and bacon, it becomes a lovely delicacy to start the day right.

What I find very amusing is their rotating cast of cashier girls, and boys. The current cast is a bit devoid of personality but they are friendly.

What can become irritating is the obnoxious suit who somehow pushes in front of you.  But Mio has no control of the crowd right?"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about Mio Express - first time there this morning.  Food looks delish but it got weird when I wanted to order a sandwich. When I asked if I could get an 'everything' bagel, the server pointed (with the knife in her hand) to a basket in the window that had nothing near what I wanted - they were mostly plain.  I found this odd since she was already cutting a sesame bagel which I assumed was for someone else.  I also found her uncomfortable and rigid and she kept turning round to talk to a coworker and looking strange at me like she was talking dis about me.  Since it was my first time there, I didn't know if I had to order breakfast items only or could have something else - when I asked, she looked at me like I was strange with a forced smile on her face.
Fake-tanned, blonde cashier needs to be a little more genuine as well - it's like they're Stepford dolls just going through the motions.  The only girl I found genuinely friendly and professional was the young dark-skinned girl who made my cafe au lait - and an excellent one at that!  I love Illy coffee which made a good start to my day.  
Despite the awdwardness of today, I do plan on returning for another one of those cafe au lait's."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich. Compared to
Some of the other places around Scotia plaza, mio had much better quality. A bit on the price side. Breakfast sandwich is just shy of $5. Line up goes by quick, however, sometimes a bit of a wait in the morning."}
{"text":"This is my third time to Mio Risto Bar and my first review.  Mio is a hidden gem.  It's located in the path in the Scotia Plaza.  Its conveniently located in the path of the financial district so you can get to this restaurant without stepping a foot outside.  Perfect for the wintertime!  It's hidden in the corner and they're known for their cafe section of the restaurant where you get coffee and breakfast.  I came for lunch. The ambiance is casual / business casual.  They're known for their Italian food. Their menu consisted of salads, pizzas, pastas and meat/fish dishes.  A lot of varieties.  I had the rigatoni with veal ragu and my friend has a salad.  My rigatoni tasted very fresh and the portion was just perfect not too huge that I need a big nap after lunch.  I really enjoyed my pasta and my friend loved her salad.  We were too full otherwise we would of ordered desserts. I tried the tiramisu in the past and it was delicious!  Service was also excellent! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch today, as it's conveniently located halfway between our respective offices. We arrived at around 1:00pm, no reservation, and there were plenty of tables available. Once we were seated, our server (Ken, I believe) came over to fill our water glasses and inform us of the daily lunch specials. 

I've been a bit under the weather lately, so I ordered the minestrone soup, and my friend chose the crab and ricotta ravioli. Ken disappeared, then we waited...and waited...and waited. When our food finally arrived, we both enjoyed our dishes, although I found the presentation of the soup to be a little thoughtless - it was served in a huge bowl which was noticeably dirty around the outside, and the bowl was so big that at one point my entire spoon fell into the soup (*embarrassing*). 

I would give the food three stars, but I found the service and overall experience to be quite poor. I had to ask to have my water refilled after it sat empty for a lengthy period of time, and I'm pretty sure I saw Ken drinking a glass of wine as I sat with an empty bowl in front of me. Eventually someone else came to clear our plates away, as Ken was standing around with a group of employees and seemed blissfully unaware of the fact that we had finished our meals. Given that we were some of the only people in the restaurant, I don't understand why the service was so shoddy. 

If you want to eat decent food somewhere other than a food court in the PATH, Mio might be a good choice...but make sure nobody will notice if you take an extended lunch break, first."}
{"text":"I was not happy with the inconsistency. I go to this restaurant every week and order the same thing. quinoa and fish. Half the container is filled with quinoa and the other with 2 big pieces of fish. Today they placed 1 fish with a bit of quinoa and they are trying to convince me that this is the right portion. ITS NOT. its no longer worth 10.50+TAX.  I walked out and not going back. there goes my weekly Mio visit. 

Cheap Idiots."}
