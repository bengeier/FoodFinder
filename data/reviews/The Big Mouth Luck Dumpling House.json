{"text":"Dumplings were really well made. I had the chicken-mushroom boiled dumplings and Hagao. Better that other places I've been to in Toronto. Not a lot of space though, and doesn't have the chinatown atmosphere a lot of dim sum places tend to have. Way more professional and cleaner than most dumpling houses."}
{"text":"Great little place a bit slow but for the price and if you aren't in a hurry its a great little place. Food is decent and tasty"}
{"text":"Went there at lunch today (friday) with a colleague. As you may know, yonge/st. clair is quite a busy office spot during the day. Sat down and ordered. 45 min (!?) later, my colleague's food came (without the extra spring roll he asked for). 10min later i am forced to flag the waiter down to tell him i have to go back to work so i need my lunch to go and the bill. Other folks got served some of their meals before us, but only 1 of 3 diners at a table for example. Place was half empty. When i finally scarfed my food back at the office it was meh. Quite greasy-- chinese food truck quality, not worth the $9. Avoid this place and let it die its rightful natural death."}
{"text":"I'm in this neighborhood from time to time to visit a friend, we come here quite often for some nice dumplings and great view. The place's clean and nice, I love those big windows, although they makes the place a bit chilly, there's no much quiet places in the city you can just sit back and watch Yonge st. from the second floor. As for the food, boiled dumplings are my favorite, especially the pork cilantro, shrimp and chive ones. My friend's from northern part of China, she mumbled after her first bite that those dumplings are definitely hand made.   Pan fried dumplings are also great, it's just it's pretty slow when they are busy and the quality was kinda inconsistence.  Other than those, I recommend their hot and sour soup (yum), green onion pan cake and seafood stirfry. I like the amount of oil they put into food, very light and tasty, it's like oil's free in some Chinese restaurants, you can almost drink them. In general, despite of their occasionally slowness and only have one waitress at all time, this is a nice place to chill and satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I go here every now and then and the food is pretty good. But don't go when you have any sort of time constraint for the next 1.5-2 hours.  With 3 of us, it's slow but bearable. Any more and the service is incredibly slow.  Once with a group of 10 of us, the waitress (who was the only one working apparently) was in mid-order taking when she walked off to greet people who walked in, and then didn't come back to finish the orders until we called for her.  Today, a colleague and I decided to try the take out since we were in a rush and couldn't stay. I ordered 2 items (dumplings and sticky rice), and colleague ordered the same. After sitting there for nearly 20 minutes (!!), the waitress brings out one bag. We asked if both orders were in there, split up for each of us. She hands us one back with the dumplings, one with the sticky rice. Turns out she hadn't put our 2nd order in. Waited ANOTHER 20 minutes before finally getting our food. Our entire lunch break where we were in a rush took 40-45 minutes sitting and waiting. I didn't even know what to say anymore after the constant \"sorrys\" that don't really mean anything at this point.  Almost an hour for 6 dumplings and sticky rice is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great and there's good peoplewatching to be had from the window tables. But the dumplings themselves could be better. More filling used? Less doughy? I don't know. I can't put my finger on why, but I left feeling a little disappointed.  Also, you can only order in dozens, so you really have to commit to one or two kinds, which is something I'm not used to doing with dumplings. Could just be me and my unhealthy love of dumplings, though.  It's a new place, so it could improve. I hope it does!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Chinese restaurant with the literal translation of the Chinese name!  My club is near here, and after a club meeting I found myself staring with bewilderment at the ridiculously named restaurant with great curiosity.  This space used to occupy an Indian restaurant, and from what I gathered, the d√©cor of Big Mouth retained much of the glory of it's predecessor.  The neighbourhood is Toronto's prestigious deer park, but I just don't see the owners investing on the kind of money to design this restaurant to it's current ambiance.  Either way, it's a good thing because it's a rather comfortable environment with a stunning view of Yonge Street.  I should have picked this up as a indicator of the prices.  The waitress and the kitchen staff here are Mandarin, but spoke to each other in English, I think it might be the official language on the dining floor.  This made it seem kind of tacky...I mean, really?  The place is called 'big mouth luck!'  I expect some energetic shouting. The biggest table here sits six, I wouldn't come here with more than that.  The menu was just a piece of paper on the table, but I had to wait for my table to be cleaned before reading it, as the only good seat by the window I've chosen was left unattended to.  The waitress apologised and I forgave her, she was polite and pretty cute, I guess.  But as many overly polite waitresses are, she had the bad habit of saying the word 'sorry' a bit too much.  Because I ordered a total of six dishes, I had to tell her \"it's okay\" almost twice as many times.   Seriously!  I am NOT offended by you bringing me the food which I've ordered..!!  Promise.  I didn't bring any reading material and my phone was out of batteries, so naturally I took out my pocket calculator and started doing math.  I did 16 minutes of math until my first dish arrived.  In a Chinese restaurant, this is considered a long wait, but then I guess I can rest assured that even at 9pm, I can trust big mouth to freshly prepare my dumpling from scratch.    By the way, this place is hella expensive for a dumpling restaurant!  Most dishes cost $8+, and that's a considerable amount as the dumplings are rather small in size, and not mind-blowingly delicious.  Look, I'm from the North, meaning that I take dumplings as serious business.  Size, portion, and yumminess are integral to us Northerners.  At those prices, I should at least be eating like the Emperor's favourite courtesan.   As I have said before, if you're charging me champagne room prices for Chinese food, I expect to be loved a long time afterwards.  I wasn't feeling the love here..  Sorry, these were A-Okay food in a nice environment, but it just wasn't good enough to satisfy my own big mouth."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place at first glance, but the ambiance is nice and the view of Yonge St is expansive and picturesque. However the two giant bird turds on the window were not so nice.  It was Saturday night around 9 pm and the place was very quiet. It took 25 minutes for some pork and cilantro dumplings, green onion pancakes beef noodle soup and wonton soup.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but most Chinese places have that shit ready for you in 5 minutes tops.  Service was sweet and polite but certainly not speedy.  Food was just ok. Wonton soup was super small and the dumplings were not te best but had some decent flavour.beef soup had a beef heart in it. Not a problem for me but  my friend was grossed out by this. Also a really weird small size for a cow's heart. Perhaps something smaller? A goat?  Not a great spot."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery. We ordered some steamed dumplings and some fried dumplings they were okay. I got shrimp fried rice and it was dry and didn't have much flavor. My boyfriend got the General Tsao chicken and he said it was just okay. Overall i'm not impressed and wouldn't order here again."}
{"text":"I just came back from lunch w/ my 2 coworkers w/ all of our lunches in takeout containers because we didn't get a chance to eat it!  Granted, we've been here a few times since it's opened up in 2012, and in the past, the food has always been alright (not bad or else I wouldn't be a repeat customer) and it's one of the cheaper places to eat around here (yes, I know it's expensive for chinese food compared to chinatown or scarb. or markham, but it's not bad for the area), and service was ok.    Never quick service - always slow, but today really took the cake.  We waited (i kid you not) AN HOUR and none of us were able to eat a proper meal!!  I ordered a hot and sour small size soup, and just a trio of fried shrimp dumplings.  I'm sure they make their soup ahead of time and it's just in a big pot being warm - how this took 40 minutes to bring out to me, is mind boggling!!  FORTY MINUTES to bring out one small bowl of soup while my coworkers are starving (one of them is pregnant mind you)!!  I understand we came at the lunch rush, and yes, I ALSO understand that there was only ONE waitress there and that it's not her fault.  However, this is not the first time I'M SURE that they've had to deal with a lunch rush - HOW ARE THEY NOT PREPARED FOR THIS AFTER BEING HERE FOR 2 YEARS??!!  Over 5 minute later, my 3 fried shrimp dumplings finally arrived, but still no food for my 2 friends, whom both ordered a lunch combo special, so it' was just stir fry meat and veggies and rice.  As soon as the waitress put the dumplings on the table, I had to tell her to wrap it up right away, along with the 2 other dishes that were suppose to come long ago.  I told her we have no more time to eat and that we have to go.  She apologized, and took it away.  Another 5-10 min later, came back w/ all the food to go.    We finally got our bills, and it was charged wrong for an item.  The waitress is now panicking trying to correct the bills while I ask for the manager.  We complained to the manager, and all he did was apologize.  I told him we like the food, but the service was just wayyyy too slow today and that he needs to hire more people.  He said he's looking for someone to hire right now, but didn't offer any discounts off our bills, or anything.  My friend had to ask for compensation, and the manager replied \"what do you want?\"  She said maybe free dumplings next time or something.  And he agreed - she asked for him to write that down for us, and he said he'll remember us.    It'll be a lonnnnng time before we come back there, that is, if they last till then.  My suggestion for this place - until they better their service, they oughta change their name to \"Good Luck Eating Dumpling House\" !!"}
{"text":"First try at this nearby dumpling house. They have a small menu of non-dumpling, non-dim sum items that are nothing special. But their boiled dumplings are excellent, nicely packed, very tasty. Their fried dumplings are equally good. Definitely worth a try for a dumpling feast."}
{"text":"Some dishes were hit and miss. Our best experience was with the pork shumai and the dumplings. General Tsao's chicken tasted like sweet and sour pork sauce added to chicken."}
{"text":"In another post, I crowned the dumpling house downtown as the king of dumplings. If they are the king, Big mouth luck is the prince who lives uptown. This place has fantastic dumplings and a very friendly staff. The only problem is a lack of people. But that is not their fault. SO get down there ASAP and eat some dumplings."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch despite seeing so many negative reviews. This place,  being one of two choices of Chinese food within walking distance to St. Clair Station, didn't give me much leverage to make harsh criticism considering the other choice is a food court option. I got BBQ duck on rice to go. It's 6.99 on menu and 7.90 with tax. This is a typical lunch order for $5-6 (including tax) elsewhere in Toronto. Seeing this is an expensive neighborhood, I suppose the extra dollar or two of charge is a-ok.  Since I read so many HORRIBLE reviews of this place, I honestly didn't expect much. So when I took my first bite into the duck and realized that it is standard quality as elsewhere I've eaten at, I was overjoyed. Of course, I meant elsewhere TAKEOUT food, not restaurant. And having looked around the restaurant, I think the duck was outsourced at a Chinese BBQ shop and/or Chinese grocery store BBQ department. It's not bad - just not all that fresh and crispy as other RESTAURANT quality duck. I will probably come back when I have sudden craving for duck again. Probably will avoid their dumplings since it's harshly criticized (and I can be a rather harsh person when it comes home-style dumplings)."}
{"text":"I work in the Yonge-Davisville area so I sometimes stroll up to St Clair. I was looking for somewhere quick because I was melting in the heat.  WHEN we are having weather like this, don't be cheap and have your A/C on!  I was sat by the window (which had a lovely view on Yonge Street), however I was looking for some cooling relief and I didn't get it here.  People were melting in this place - come on buddy give me break.  I saw him at one point going to the control panel to change the controls but by this time I was almost on my way out.   I sat there for nearly 15 minutes before getting served and a couple were served before me who were seated AFTER I had arrived - so I was losing patience and not happy at this point. I'm not one to get up and leave but I was getting to that point.   I ordered from the Business menu - Black pepper stirfry with veggies and tofu and rice. It took awhile to come which is odd for a chinese restaurant, but I can assume it's made fresh so I was happy about that. I meal came first and my friend had to wait for his meal another 5 mintues.  I don't like meals being served like that - bring it together.  It's rude for me to start my meal and your company is still waiting for theirs.  I was half done eating by the time he got his.   The food itself was great and I really enjoyed it.  However the wait staff need to get it together.  Make your patrons confortable, acknowledge your customers and check back to make everything is okie and if there is anything else that they need.  In the end I had to flag him for the bill because God knows when he would've come back to clear our dishes away."}
{"text":"Floors were covered in the winter-y salty grime and it didn't seem like anyone was interested in cleaning it up.  The lunch specials were small in portion size for typical 'fake' Chinese food (eg. sweet and sour pork, general tsao chicken, etc). The meat had too much batter and there was too much celery and onions acting as fillers on the meat side. The vegetable side of the lunch special had the same celery and onions this time with trace amounts of baby corn and broccoli. Rice was generous.  The dumplings were ok. At $4 for 6, I thought they were pricey especially since they didn't taste particularly special.  The view from the window is spectacular. The waitress was friendly, but the restaurant was empty when I went in for lunch (?). They play Cantonese and Mandarin music in the background but the waitress doesn't speak Cantonese (?). Free wifi from the pub across the street (FnF). They recommend using debit/cash if the bill is under $15 according to a sticker on the bill sleeve but not sure if any extra charge exists."}
{"text":"I went here after reading someone's positive review on the internet. To be honest, their dumplings are NOTHING SPECIAL. I've experienced better dumplings in Markham. I have no reason to go back and try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is very cute!  I really like the atmosphere and its a nice view if you sit near the window.  I didn't have any of the dumplings which is their specialty so i cant comment on that.  Instead we had spring rolls, wonton soup, general tso chicken, rice, and vegetable stir-fry.  The spring rolls were mediocre, not as good as most spring rolls I've had in the past.  The wonton soup was actually really bad, it tasted like chemicals, we couldn't finish the bowl.  The general chicken again was very average, just some breaded chicken tossed in a very generic sauce.  The portion size was kind of small too considering it was $9.99.  The veggies were average, very plain.  Overall a VERY average dinner, I probably wont order the same things again and maybe try out the dumplings next time."}
{"text":"We were stuck for some GF options in Deer Park, and thought we'd give it a try. We had the hargow, sticky rice, cuttlefish, beancurd, wonton soup and hot/sour soup.  We found the technical cooking to be proficient, but thought many of the dishes were bland in our opinion. The cuttlefish is a perfect example of this: they were perfectly cooked, but the accompanying curry sauce was forgettable. They didn't even have tripe! It's a cardinal sin in my book.  Is it because it's in an unadventurous neighbourhood? I don't get it - dim sum is popular everywhere in this city, so I'm confused as to why it was just 'meh'.  I don't think it would survive if it were in Chinatown, that's for sure."}
