{"text":"The #22 Dinner Combo (String Bean in Black Bean Sauce w/ Shrimp) was the best black bean sauce I've had since leaving NY. Now, if they only had Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce  ;-), Looking forward to going back and trying their Singapore Style Mei Fun and other specialities."}
{"text":"I had the spicy garlic chicken combination with low mein. It was tasty and not overly spicy. The wontons were filled with filling and very delicious. My husband had the shrimp egg foo young. It was light flavorful and not overly greasy.  I appreciated the servers suggestions for accompaniment sides with our meals. This is the third time I've eaten here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have gotten food from here a couple of times in the past and it was ok maybe 2 stars at best, too bad because they are very close to me. But I got chicken chow mein last night and it was a gelatinous mess. Barely edible and I'm throwing the rest of it away since the amount of noodles they give aren't even enough for one serving and I can't imagine eating it without disguising it in some way. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was craving hot and spicy soup at 9:30pm the sign said they closed at 10pm. I walked in and was greeted very warmly by three people. I asked if they were closed and they said \"oh no!! Order what we you like!\" All I wanted was soup. Skeptical to order soup this late at night, I did anyway. I waited about ten minutes and my soup came out wrapped up enough for two, with wontons and two fortune cookies. The soup was piping hot and totally hit the spot. I will definitely be back!!! The service was the icing on the cake"}
{"text":"Just ordered food from this place and deeply disappointed. My family picked out the  1) Chicken Fried Rice ($6.75), 2) Sizzling Soup ($6.50), and 3) Orange Chicken ($8.50). Our expected total was somewhere around $21.75 given the listed prices. However,  after getting our food delivered, we were hit with a bill of $30.95. 

After calling to see why there was such a big discrepancy, the lady on the phone informed us that there was a delivery charge added to the order ($3.00). Nowhere on the menu is there anything that notes a delivery charge. Rather, the \"We Deliver\" notice on the menu simply states \"Min. Order $20.00, Not Including Tax.\" Usually, at most places I've eaten at, where there is a minimum delivery amount, no delivery charge is added. Here, they just shove a charge onto your bill without telling you.

Without any satisfaction with respect to the bill, we decided to eat our $30 rice, chicken, and soup... Try should be more appropriate for what was attempted. The sizzling soup contained a single shrimp (no exaggeration) and was cold. The chicken fried rice had roughly three pieces of chicken with the remainder being mostly eggs. As for the orange chicken; well, I am not sure it was chicken. It was the equivalent of attempting to eat the connective tissue found between the joints of chicken bones (if that description helps). 

All-in-all: I won't be ordering from this place again. The amount of food and bogus charges aren't worth the hassle."}
{"text":"If you really want to experience the worse case of food poisoning in your life..try this place. I use to be a fan and ate there previously. I placed a family order one Sunday night and 2 out of the 3 of us ended up in the Banner ER with severe food poisoning. I would give them \"0\" stars but Yelp wont allow me...EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good and delivery is quick. Eat from here often and have never had a bad experience. Try the Singapore Rice Noodles if you eat here."}
{"text":"This place is in an industrial area and is easy to miss but keep looking it's there. We have found this place to be the best chinese food in AZ. And not a single item is over $10. There are only about 6 tables but it is rarely busy when we go. Delicious, great portions, my friend is a New York Jew and he loves it. Lol. Go support your local mom and pop restaurant and have some fantastic chinese food. They do carryout and they are right by the 101 so pick some up on your way home."}
{"text":"I did not think it was possible to have Chinese delivery this bad. Every last offering was just the worst it could be. The rice was old and dry. The chicken greasy and... off (I will not go so far as to say spoiled, but I would like to). The beef dishes couldn't be eaten because they were tough, dry, and... um. leathery, yea - that's it. beef flavored leather. 
I only ordered from this restaurant because they pinned a flyer to my door advertising the establishment as \"New York Style Chinese Take Out\", and if the meal that I received is what people in New York get for Chinese take out I really feel bad for them."}
{"text":"I've had the General Tso's, the lemon chicken, the honey chicken and the crab puff appetizers. All of it is delicious and the service us amazing."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I live in an apartment and we've received several fliers for this place so we decided to give it a try because they deliver and we didn't feel like driving anywhere. 

I called at 6:53 and placed 2 dinner entree meals. She told me it would be 45 min to an hour (which is long considering I live 7 min away). At 8:15 way longer then what I was quoted I decide to start calling. I called them 7 times and received no answer!! The phone kept ringing off the hook!! I then decided to drive there because I still didn't receive my food and they weren't answering. We pull up and literally 1 car was in the parking lot and it looked so dead. I seriously thought the door was going to be locked. I walk in and there is NO ONE. Not one employee and not one customer so I ring the bell and some lady comes from the back and says \"hi, to go order\". I said no I placed an order over an hour and a half ago for
Delivery and still haven't received it. This lady has the audacity to tell me they're really busy so it took longer. I looked her dead in her face and said how are you busy! There is NO ONE here. She said the delivery guy was on his way, mind you it's 8:30 at this point. I said cancel my order, this is ridiculous and horrible service for my first time.     
Oh and when I told the lady I ordered at 6:53 she pointed to her receipt where she wrote down the order and said no you ordered at 7! Omg
Lady just because you wrote that down is That supposed to mean something? It's 8:30!! 

I then asked for a refund which I got with no problem but that's not the point. I NEVER got my food and I waited over an hour and a half and I live up the street!!!
WORST SERVICE EVER and I will not be trying again."}
{"text":"Food here is not good. Servings are small and the Orange chicken was old and tasted like it was fried in old oil. Also had some wontons that were very old."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I have to say that this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Peoria."}
{"text":"We live nearby & get J&M takeout a lot.
We enjoy their NY recipes.  
Lovely couple that own/run it."}
{"text":"Date: Dec 2011 

Ordered: 
1- Orange Chicken 
1 - Beef Chow Fun 

Total: Less than $19.00

Once was enough. 

Orange Chicken - I could feel the corn starch used in the sauce... yes the sauce was gritty, and not flavorful. 

Beef Chow Fun - The edges of the noodles were hard, like they had dried out. This dish was missing that key chow fun flavor. 

*************

Atmosphere: Dirty Dive

When you walk in, there is stickiness about the whole place. 
This is a serious hole in the wall; whole restaurant seating is about 20, if that. 

*************

This place is really close to where I live, and I pass by there often; I had wanted to try it. 
Now, that I have, I'm over it. 

I still pass by, and I never see any customers there - ever!!!
I think this place is a front for something else."}
{"text":"They have been canvassing our neighborhood with their flyers. The first time we called at 7pm and they said they couldn't deliver too busy.  I decided that they probably received a better response to their flyers than they were expecting.  Ok. They did another round of flyers so we  decided to give them a try again. This was 2 days post receiving a second flyer. Again, we were told take out only. No delivery. They don't seem to speak English as a first language, but it didn't seem to impair our conversation.  I can't review the food because we have never been able to try it, based on other reviews I may have been saved!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Extremely clean.  Small but not tiny.  Perfect for me since i dont like crowds or noise.  You must try this place.  I dont think you will be disappointed at all.  The prices are great too.  I had orange chicken and it was great.  I know we all have different tastes but i loved it.  I got so much that i had to bring the rest home."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I expected this place to be hit or miss, some say terrible, some say the best there is. When I stopped in, this was far from the best, but not the worst either. This is a complete hole in the wall restaurant in an industrial area as stated in another review. If you aren't looking, you probably wouldn't see it. 

I walked into the place and was immediately glad I was getting my food to go. Its a small dining room in need of some TLC (didn't appear dirty, but decoration wise). Drab and dingy is the best way to describe it. I ordered a lunch special Garlic Chicken, which was a good price. Got my order and it smelled great, went to eat it and was sad I stopped there. You can give food all the aroma you want, but when it lacks flavor it makes you sad inside. Bland food, and on top of it a rather small portion as well. The \"spring rolls\" are unbelievably tiny, thickness and length of your pinky would be a good comparison. 

So if you need food, stop there and try it, just don't expect the 5 stars some have given it. I hope I hit them on an off day, but seeing as I was the only person in there I cant imagine that being the case. As for going back, I am extremely reluctant, but I will check back here in hopes for a good review from others."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for about 3 years and we love there food. My daughter age 6 loves there beef lo main I always get the house lo main and my husbands favorite is the spicy fried rice. We have no complaints ever and been going there going on 4 years. The staff is friendly,the place itself is a little small but all in all its a great place with great food. If you want good chinese food at a good price this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"OMG finally Chinese restaurant that delivers!!  Makes me soooo happy!!  Food lets just say we order alot that they know what we want how we want it and where we live.   Always getting Dinner J special   beef w/ broccoli   or   orange beef  and steak in Vietnam sauce with egg drop soup!   4 stars cuz its wierd they are closed on a Tuesday very random..."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim.  Looks can be deceiving as this place was great.   Service was excellent.  Ordered the orange chicken and hot tea.  Meal came with a fried spring roll and a couple other fried app and soup.  Everything was hot, and delicious.  Chicken wasn't the usual weird ball shape meat but actual cuts off a breast.   I would t drive all the way out to Peoria to eat here but if I was in the area and hungry I'd stop."}
{"text":"Great delivery service - fast, and accurate. The person who answered the phone repeated everything back perfectly and with excellent annunciation. Food was still hot upon delivery (rice steaming). Sadly, any hope for overcoming the poor reviews ends there.

Our order: J&M Sampler, Fried rice (I think Thai based on the turmeric/curry), Kung Pao chicken, twice cooked pork, string bean beef, and Singapore style rice noodle. Out of everything I tried, I only enjoyed the spring roll. 

The spring roll, inaccurately described in another post as being the size of that individual's pink finger, resembled how I imagine either Hagrid's or Andre the Giant's pinky fingers may appear. I estimate the spring roll's size between that of a roll of quarters and a roll of nickles. I like super skinny spring rolls - especially those with multiple dipping sauces such as the wasabi mustard provided on the side here (not the just the mustard in the little packet). The rest of the sampler lacked flavor and stuff. For instance, why eat plain fried wontons? To taste the cooking oil? The sweet crab puff lacked filling and crab. The fried shrimp appeared jumbo sized, but the puffed out breading misled me. It tasted overcooked with a rubbery texture. 

The box of fried rice says T - so, yup, we ordered Thai style. Three pieces of shrimp, chewy chunks of chicken, bean shoots, egg, tiny pieces of pea pod, carrot, BBQ beef, no pineapple. The dish tasted bitter and lacked flavor. The textural issues applied to the rice (felt powdery in my mouth) and chicken. I spit a few pieces out. 

The Singapore Style Rice Noodle became my husband's leftover lunch and was the only' other item (spring roll) I could swallow. It too felt powdery in my mouth and very similar to Thai style rice - same sauce and same meats. Hey - same dish different base (rice vs noodle). Well cooked noodles, not greasy, not crunchy, not sticky...not tasty either. Same issues as fried rice.

Onto the three dishes...1) String bean beef contained edible and chewable beef but the thick sauce tasted of reduced and salted soy sauce. 2) Twice cooked pork's sauce tasted the best, kinda sweet, kinda salty, not too thick...but the inedible meat turned me off. The meat contained large chunks of chewy fat, grizzle, and even bone shards. 3) Kung Pao chicken - oh my what few and large chunks of chicken you have, oh my how many teeny tiny chopped veggies do you have, oh my a total lack of spice. Come to think of it, everything was bland and nothing was even remotely spicy.

I cannot recommend this restaurant and am disappointed that such good customer service and delivery is wasted on terrible food."}
{"text":"Just went 12/10/12. It was terrible. Rice smelled and tasted like smoke and was very greasy. I literally had to take all the chicken pieces in the rice out because it was terrible unflavored boiled chicken. Lo mein was very greasy and had an off flavor. I can say the sweet and sour rice was good. The hot and sour soup is a 5/10 compared to other places. The dining room is very dirty. the area outside is a dark empty parking lot and honestly it made me nervous since that area isn't that good. Overall I won't be going back and I wish I never went."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered plain Lomein noodles to go, and they gave me chow mein noodles. I asked them if they could fix my order and they immediately started yelling at me and were refusing to fix my order \"because they would have to pay for it\" I have never had such horrible customer service or have been yelled at like that at a restaurant. Worst experience ever, and I paid. They can happily keep my money I am just baffled."}
{"text":"Sorry J&M not good......My family of five ordered from here over this past weekend.  Sat. 7/27 to be exact.  We have enjoyed the food here in the past, but this time it was NOT good, in fact it was really bad.  Disappointing...we called just to let them know how disappointed we were  Not in a nasty way, in a concerned way like hey.. did you change cooks kinda way.  Unfortunately the language barrier was to great....we just wanted to let them know that it was not good and all five of us were amazed at how different the food was from previous years.  They called our number back, apparently from caller ID to confirm our order...Going to miss this place..."}
{"text":"This restaurant says that they have a large area that they deliver to but after waiting 45 minutes I got a phone call that they do not deliver 15 minutes away from where they are located, and I ordered $40 worth of food and now it is 7:00 pm. I ask if they deliver to the area when I first called, not a problem. I'm not happy at all."}
