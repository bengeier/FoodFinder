{"text":"Food quality is not great, not the absolute worst.  If you're not there at the early morning special when prices are $2.30/dish, it's not worth it.    We ordered extra dishes (pork buns), which never came, even though we asked 4 times over the course of 40 minutes.  Each time the server assured us that it was just  about to leave the kitchen.  The dishes they have were clearly purchased and heated to order, which lots of other restaurants don't do."}
{"text":"I'm quite generous with my opinions on restaurants but this place is the most chaotic and worst service on the face of the planet! Worse than the Seinfeld episode!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for a wedding with your standard 10 course Chinese wedding menu.  Food was BELOW PAR and absolutely disgusting.  Why the one star??? for the decor, nice for a Chinese restaurant.  The best part of the dinner was the coke, that came in a can!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for dim sum. The place is old school like its patrons- atmosphere big dining hall noisy but no push carts. The place was once shut down due to health inspection. The food was shiet. only saving grace was it was cheap - that's cos i didn't  dare to order anymore of their shiet food. You know when you put something in your mouth and it just doesn't feel right - and you want to spit it out. That sums up my experience."}
{"text":"Being a weekday was not the main reason Regal Chinese Restaurant was completely empty, when we arrived.  Our table of 4 was seated immediately on a late Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant is large. Obviously, hosting many weddings/events here.  After selecting our choices on the menu, we waited an eternity for a server to take our order. They were just too busy gossiping by the bar. Finally, our sheet was taken and when asked if a Senior Discount applied, the waitress snapped \"yes.\"  Perhaps, she is asked this often?  Food arrival was terrible. We waited almost 45 minutes for any sign of a dumpling or rice roll. At that point, we swallowed the bland, overly greasy, and sloppy food.  As mentioned by Jennifer K, even with the Senior Discount, prices were still very high for a week day. Our bill was shocking for a weekday afternoon.  Combined with the rude service, poor quality and high prices, I won't be returning. Agreed with other Yelpers that there are too many other good dim sum places."}
{"text":"2.5/3. The dim sum here is decent, nothing special but not noticeably well done either."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the old Ruby Restaurant when it occupied the same space (too crowded and chaotic, so so food, too far to drive too). When it re-opened as Regal, with all the buzz and anticipation, I couldn't resist giving it a try and really wanted to like it more.   Regal tries to be everything to everyone, but ends up being neither here nor there and lost in a sea of decent Cantonese restaurants in GTA.   Regal wants to give you good tasting and \"healthy\" dim sum, well adding mushrooms to chicken feet doesn't make it healthier but it ruins the chicken feet scene for a traditionalist who doesn't care for little mushrooms sticking to the feet!   Regal wants to be, well, Regal, but it's still a noisy and chaotic place, in particular at dim sum time. The prices have gone up, the food tastes about the same perhaps with slightly better presentation, new uniforms and new process (i.e. menu-ordering replaced the old push carts), but no substantive changes to make this place wow you.   With plenty of other choices in GTA, I wouldn't have an urge to go back."}
{"text":"I think this is the place where people got sick. LOL. Then they cleaned it up and rename the place. It use to be call RUBY.  The wait was pretty bad. I don't know why I go to dim sum when the service sucks. I guess I always get fished in because of cheap food. may be I got start learning Cantonese to get serve at one of these places.  The Food was not bad. There we 7 of us total. The bill was even better. It was around 80 bucks with taxes and tips. With that price I am pretty sure they got their grocery from one of the coupon deals. May be Groupon or Dealfind. hahaha  The place just like most dim sum place is a mess. Pretty crowded during rush hour. Which will be around 11am - 1 pm. I also notice they don't have lady with the cart coming around with food. What's wrong with dim sum places these days. I use to like that especially if you don't speak Cantonese. You just have to point and smile. \"Yes, Mam, That funny look food is what I like, and NOT those chicken feet\" :-)  Will I go back? Nah, Unless someone is picking up the tab and I am around the neighborhood. Will I recommend this  place to anyone. Sure why not. The food is Cheap and FUNKY :-)"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is decent. I prefer the old style tea house with carts of steaming food that come around. 5 well fed adults at Sunday AM Dim Sum for less than 50$ is good though."}
{"text":"Total WITHDRAWAL symptoms while I take every bite of Dim Sum here.  I grew up on this food category and as I eat I start to miss the OLD-SCHOOL Dim Sum more and more.  This is of course MY personal preference according to MY background.  Maybe the SENIORS who get 20% discount here like this cleaner flavour, but my folks only A-OK it as well.  This whole health trend is great and all but when applied to Dim Sum in this method it no longer brings back my memories of Dim Sum of my past.  Chicken Feet here came with Enoki Mushrooms which doesn't add or take-away anything to this dish, however the sauce was WEAKER than usual without that finger-licking good feel.  Do I feel healthier?  Good question!  Plain Congee was good and came with Deep-Fried Dough Sticks but after investigation I noticed that it was RE-FRIED and not fresh.  It was cut into smaller sticks and re-fried so the whole thing was over-crisp unlike traditional sticks that come in PAIRS as long sticks and soft on the inside.  Regal Group prides itself on health consciousness, fairness to workers, and modernization of operations which is a nice change to move it forward to the 21st Century.  Yeah Yeah! It does lose a sense of Dim Sum TRADITION and CULTURE which I'm a huge fan of but the only constant is change after-all.  The FRESH prepared food and taken out individually method is something that probably isn't preferred here.  Ruby restaurant did CARTS method before and for the majority of the demographics which are ELDERS, they would preferred to have it that way so when the carts come they can CHAT with the push-cart staff instead of seeing someone jump in and out.  Secondly, even if they change over to the push-cart method it will not work here as the staff are RELATIVELY young and might not have the stories and experience to share with the majority of the patrons that frequent here.  Aside from the other reviews of this location which are informative, you can also see the sister locations review that I find very similar(http://www.yelp.ca/biz/regal-palace-richmond-hill)"}
{"text":"I just returned from Regal for dinner.  We have gone there twice for dim sum and found it enjoyable.  Quality of dim sum, variety and especially the 20% seniors discount.  It was thus a big surprise just how BAD dinner was.  Yeah, a wedding banquet was going on, but I have been to other Chinese restaurants when there were banquets and their service and food quality did not suffer.  The green bean soup was very unique but was the only highlight of the dinner.  The duck was good. We were a bit upset that the waiter said they had run out of fresh fish, and asked if we wanted to replace it with a fried fish.  We asked if we could replace it with some other dishes.  Replaced it with a thousand island shrimp.  It tasted awful.  In all my years going to Chinese restaurant, I have never sent back a dish to the kitchen until today.   The smell of it was also making one of my kids nauseous.  DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH!  It was after most of our dishes had arrived that the service also vanished!  Sat waiting for half a hour and finally had to tell them to bring us the rice + noodles.  Even though the set menu had dessert, they gave us the red bean soup which they gave all the tables.  Also, they must use a lot of MSG.  Everyone felt incredibly thirsty after the meal.  I don't usually drink cold water but drank 2 cups after this meal.  My wife and I decided to not bother asking for a discount on the bill (given the awful shrimp dish we had sent back) since we feared it would take them another 1/2 hour to sort this out.  I was going to tip them only 10% of the pretax price given the poor service.  When the maitre'd saw the amount we were tipping, he hinted (i.e. repeated to us the final amount on the bill) that it was not enough.  Gave another 5$.  Boy, did I ever feel that we overpaid on this dinner.  I have had better service at Congee Queen/Wong or Asian Legend.  Definitely will not return here for dinner.  You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Went here because Congee Town next door was not open yet. Food is decent but service is inattentive and the prices are steep (which aren't even listed on the menu--I found them on another yelp review). Senior discount makes it a bit better but doesn't make up for the bad service. No one at the door to greet or seat guests which I hate. It takes forever to flag down a server and overall the staff seem lackadaisical. The place looks nicer than the previous Ruby Restaurant but the place is half empty. Only seems to attract seniors.  NOTE: Senior discount only applies to seniors 65 and over, so we didn't even get the discount because my MIL is too young!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the complaints are about on here.  This is the best dim sum I've ever had! And I'm Chinese so I know good dim sum from bad dim sum. All these other reviews are from a while back, so maybe it was different back then.  So why not give it another try?"}
{"text":"This is for a dinner review  Chicken & shark fin soup - this tasted good but not really worth the price; not a lot of shark fin Chinese style beef steak - yummy, the beef steak is so tender XO sauce mushroom & fish fillet - the XO sauce is just right Gogi & veggie - not impressed, not a lot of taste Hand oiled  chicken - a fancy name for deep fried chicken.. the chicken was very dry...  Service on the slow side.  The most interesting thing is the restaurant doesn't give changes back....we waited for awhile and didn't asked, later just give up  and left"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: DO NOT GO.  So this used to be Ruby Chinese, they were great! We walked in this place and saw an upgraded dining area so we hoped it would be more upscale and better than before.  The service is horrible, the waitresses were rude.  The waiter lied to us about a dish having scallops in it, this one steamed rice dish.  It was the only reason we went here in the first place!  And it did not then he lied and said the chef must have forgotten and would not replace the dish.  They also screwed up our appetizer and the manager took the order list with him and finally fixed it then didn't bring the list back and another waitress though we hid the list on them and was accusing us of hiding it.  We gave them 0 dollars for tip, I have only done that twice in my entire life!  The other thing is the dishes were really small, really expensive, and not good at all!  I will never go back to this place again, we ended up having to eat somewhere else that night after we spent $200 WITH 20% discount!  What in the world?"}
{"text":"The main draw of this place is the cheap Dim Sum that gets even more discounted for seniors (10% if I remember correctly). And you can tell what the demographic is if you come on a weekday during the daytime. It's mostly all Chinese seniors. Not to be mean or anything, but I think they come because A) it's very cheap and B) maybe their taste buds have slightly declined over the years so they don't mind the sub-par dim sum. I know I sound like a snob, but I've eaten tons of Dim Sum around, including the Michelin-starred one in HK which is as cheap as some of the Dim Sum in Toronto.  When I came here we ordered tons of food. The best dim sum they have (not saying much) is their steamed baos (buns), where the buns are moist. For example, their Cha Siu Baos (BBQ pork buns) were the best things there. Their cheung fans (wrapped rice noodle rolls) were okay. The pastries (ie. BBQ pork pastries) are overly sweet. Siu Mai/Har Gow were not bad, but you have to get them fresh and eat them while they're hot otherwise they are rubbery.   If you're only considering value and not taste, this is the place to go, otherwise try the tons of other places in the area (ie. Casa Imperial, Dragon Dynasty, Crown Prince)"}
{"text":"I used to like going to Regal because of the good food and the ease we could get a table, maybe due to the large size of the restaurant and the high price of the food. If you're with a senior citizen, you will get 20% off, which brings down the price. I do enjoy their sticky rice as well - very tasty.  However, after my last experience, I will never return again. It has fallen into the trap of many a chinese dim sum restaurant before it - once it's popular, it's impossible to get a seat, unless you know someone. Really, it's like going to a night club, lining up for no reason while you watch group after group skip the line and go in front of you. Seriously, on a weekend morning, when I'm hungry, there are just way too many other nice, good dim sum restaurants out there, especially in Scarborough, for me to waste my time here. I would suggest you do the same, unless you can arrive there before 10:30am."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant has such terrible ratings--but holy moley, this place is the real deal! The service was fast/efficient and the food was AMAZING. It's been four hours since my meal at Regal, and I'm still basking in the after-glow of truly satisfying dim sum.  I usually get my dim sum fix at Rol San (downtown Toronto); so using Rol San as a means of comparison, Regal had exceptionally better food when it came to quality and the price was about the same if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Food is very well done.  Prices steep.  Dining room is very nice.  Waitstaff is overall very professional and attentive.  Went here twice last week."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the place is super crowded.  It felt like I was in more of a battlefield then a  restaurant with all the people running around and the noise level was out of this world.  Half of our table's order never arrived and we had to ask for the stuff with a bunch of us sitting around waiting.  The decoration was decent which is why it gets a one star however the price is not which is why i'll never go back.  Seriously there are better places in the city for Chinese Dim Sum so I'm just going to have to keep looking.  And yes they did take the change and never came back gees so much for leaving nothing."}
{"text":"If my father is the one that is writing this review for Regal Chinese Restaurant, he would have give this place a 5 star.  He felt so at home when we having dim sum this weekday afternoon, as this place was packed with seniors!!   He felt special because we got 20% senior discount and free tea just because of his presence.  He enjoyed the dim sum, but he didn't know that they were quite pricey even with the 20% off when compared to the other ones he been to...  He really like the huge dinner room, the high ceiling, the nice table cloths and all the polite waitstaff...  But he didn't know the cost of dim sum as he was searching the menu where I ticked off our order.  Small ($2.80)/ Medium ($3.80)/ Large ($4.80)  The dim sum was all really good, not too oily or salty or full of MSG.  He enjoyed walking around Woodside Square after having dim sum at Regal Chinese Restaurant and seeing all these seniors all hanging around the mall...  I think Regal Chinese Restaurant becomes one of his favourite dim sum place in Toronto...  Too bad for me Regal is a 3 star...."}
{"text":"Dim sum was ok I didn't care much for their siu mai.  Good service.  Typical Chinese style restaurant."}
{"text":"Regal Palace Chinese Cuisine has taken over the Health Inspected and troubled Ruby restaurant that's been at Woodside Square for a number of years. The inside has been redesigned and the decor looks to be more modern than my last visit to Ruby. I have to say, I do like the middle ceiling section of the restaurant. It's not crazy, but to me I have always liked a nice and simple design and decor.  We tried out Regal Palace for one of those big Chinese-style family meal gatherings. There was a fair amount of people at the restaurant and on this occasion, if you didn't make reservations... then you'll be waiting for a while. We started ordering a ton of food and your typical suspects were covered. From congee to egg tarts, from \"ha gau\" shrimp dumplings to \"sew mai\" (steamed wrapped.... beef, I'm struggling on the translation I know, =P). But whatever you expected from dim sum, trust me we got it all. And for me, whenever I go for dim sum I order one of my favourites - fried dough wrapped in rice noodle (bad translation?). How was it you might ask at this restaurant? It was actually, average or even slightly below average. The food overall, was pretty average across the board. Nothing was particularly great... I mean the egg tarts were good, but I don't feel like it warranted the price. The blackbean pork rib rice was pretty disappointing. The rice was over cooked and if you know the dish, they oven it for a fair amount of time before serving. So with the method of preparing the dish, the rice cooked for a longer period before it finally came to our table.   Overall, I would have to say for the price, I didn't like Regal Palace. There are a number of Dim Sum places in the GTA. So competition is pretty high. Like most people, I'm unwilling to spend a lot on food when the quality simply isn't there. I don't mind paying the price if it was good. You might say with the restaurant being a packed house... maybe that's what caused the quality to drop. But as we all know, first impressions are important and with my experience, I don't think I'll be back for dim sum. Maybe their dinner menu is better, maybe."}
