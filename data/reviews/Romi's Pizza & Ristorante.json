{"text":"I ordered the lasagna for take it and it was soooooo good. It was clearly freshly made as it was piping hot to a ooey gooey perfection. The sauce, the noodles, everything was delicious. I will defenitely be back to try all the other items!"}
{"text":"My husband stopped in this place for a beer one night and brought their menu home since we order takeout once a week.  we figured we'd give them a try.  When I went to pick up my order, the man behind the counter seemed very intense and not happy.  Then, like a ray of sunshine in the darkness came a smiling, pleasant lady who made me feel very welcome and at ease.   We ordered their pizza pickup special..  unfortunately their sauce tasted like it had gone bad and it tasted sour which set the tone for the entire meal., and they were verrrrry cheap on the bacon.  It was more like a faint essence of bacon, but it really couldn't be seen on the pizza..  The pepperoni had a nice crisp to it and the crust was nice too.  it has potential to say the least. We also ordered a Veal sandwich.. sour sauce taste again and very skimpy on the veal too, but the bread was nice and fresh. Ha!  Overall, Not my idea of a yummy place to eat.  sorry."}
{"text":"I ordered classico pizza, wings and a veal sandwich for take out.   Everything taste bland felt cheaply, quickly made, very disappointing, will not visit or order anything from this place again.   I felt so regret and that I should have ordered from Milano's - way better."}
{"text":"The best Pizza and Veal Sandwich outside of Italy        You have to eat here.  The Staff is Family and everything is fresh made"}
{"text":"Food was good, not mind blowing but good. I don't typically write reviews but today was an exception.  Our waiter, Danielle, was very helpful and she showed above average customer service which is hard to find these days.  She would look over to see if we needed any refilling pretty often which I really appreciate. Overall great experience this Valentine's Day here, and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relatively quiet place to have a meal with friends or family.   Food: 4/5 Portion Size: 5/5 Customer Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5  Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. Definitely my go to when I'm in the delivery boundaries. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I always order from here, never eat in - though they're in a nice location on Bloor in the Kingsway area.  The order is always pretty much the same - a large pizza with 3-4 ingredients including ham and sliced tomatoes, and one large Italian salad. The pizza is in a style I like. As with most pizza, it's all about the crust. I like their food, and I like their style (low key, always there for ya). Hopefully you'll find the same.  Their menu says \"Since 1966\". It's easy to see why."}
{"text":"Within the last 2 weeks, we ate there twice.  Once we sat in for dinner. The other we did take out with their pizza. So first - Dinner.  Our table had the lamb, chicken parm and grilled chicken with pasta. They gave us a basket of breads/butter and slices of focaccia.  The lamb was cooked well and the rosemary mash potatoes were delicious.  Good portion size.  We didn't even need to finish our bread.  Like the fact that the parmesan and chill flakes is on our table. (no freshly grated parmesan though.  Small place. Staff was friendly and quick.  We had originally wanted to go to Mama Martinos but there's always a line up at that place.  Here we were seated right away.  The prices were only a tad higher but the quality of food is also better.  And it's nice to feel like you're not pressured to eat fast and get out.  To not have to wait for a table is also a bonus! The Take out Pizza.  It was just ok.  I have had better pizza elsewhere.  So that being said, I'd prob go back to Romi's for the other entrees other than pizza.  You have to pay for parking if you want to park near Romi's however, if you go around the corner and down a block or so, there is free parking on the street."}
{"text":"i'll give them this: they're quick. but that's all i'll give them.   the food was okay, better than fast food pizza (pizza hut, domino's, etc.). salad was small, oily, and lack-luster (iceberg, tomato slices, and a teaspoon of shredded mozz). pizza was crammed into a too-small box and not evenly cut.   what bothered me the most was the conversation with the owner when i phoned to order. first of all, i ordered one pizza with one topping on it: $3 per topping. fine. sausage on half and tomatoes on the other. he wanted to charge me for two toppings. how does that make sense? sure it's two different toppings, but if you're putting half the quantity of each one, .5 + .5, in my books, equals, and will always equal, 1. when i challenged this, he said he's been doing it like that for 47 years. i would have just picked one topping but in my relationship, one of us is a vegetarian and so, i was at his mercy. then i thought, well, i'll just put the sausage on half. but then why should i pay $3 for half of what i'm entitled?   second, he couldn't properly add up the items on my bill. he kept coming up with $3 more than my addition (after agreeing to his first-and-last-time, double topping charge). after breaking the items down, one at a time, i realized apart from not using a cash register, computer, or calculator of any kind (relying on basic addition) that he was charging me 15% tax. when i challenged his sum, he challenged back. i held my ground. adding 3 amounts together and applying 13% HST is not rocket science. at this point, i'm guessing he was using some yellowed, old-school document that applies a tax percentage to an amount.   now it's easy to dismiss this as some older guy, not from around here, not able to figure out a total. but you know what? f that. he's running a business. and i'm pretty sure that being located in an incredibly affluent part of the city, he's filed his business taxes every year. and is 100% certain that HST is 13%. i'm also pretty sure he's using the same (non-existent) system to calculate tax on every order. and with an extra 2% on every. single. order., he's figured out a great way to absorb his credit card fees, all wrapped up in some adorably ignorant, old school, grandpa persona.  well done, romi. well done."}
{"text":"Romi's does the best pizza delivery in this part of town. I would know because I survive mainly off of pizza and have ordered from everyone around. Taste wise, Milano, Paesano, Wize Guys, and all the chains fall short. While FBI and Dino's also have decent pies, Romi's delivers faster."}
{"text":"I really like this place - great pizza, timely delivery and super, super friendly service (especially from Jerry).  I ordered about 20 or so large pizzas (various toppings) for an office lunch and, as I said, they were delivered right on time with NO ERRORS whatsoever.  The pizzas were hot, fresh and very tasty - highly recommended.  Everyone loved them and we would definitely order from them again.  Try and support local Etobicoke businesses if you can."}
{"text":"Very Italian with particularly good sauces.. I often just come in to order sauces.The best service. And a selection you can't beat."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with a really tasty crust.  Fast and friendly delivery service.  Good prices.  What more could you want??  I haven't eaten in the restaurant itself, so can't comment on that, but have had a couple of great experiences with the delivery."}
{"text":"So I was hungry at noontime when I stumbled upon Romi's lunch special sign: $8.99 for starters and choice of pasta or pizza. Not a bad deal, I thought. I love small and intimate Italian restaurants with old-fashioned home-style cooking, and was hoping this would be another new discovery for me. The minute I saw my Caesar salad though, I knew I was in the wrong place. Fake bacon bits? Come on... that's not the way to do it. And my dressing was something out of a bottle as well rather than traditionally made. That would be fine at a fast-food joint, but unacceptable at an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant. There was free focaccia bread all right, but it was obviously stale-- maybe at least a day old. Anyway I let that go and was thinking maybe the pizza would be good because people seem to be raving about it. I was expecting it would be Italian style with a nice thin crust, rich tomatoes, and olive oil.. but what I got was just some glorified version of pizza pizza. There wasn't even enough veggies in it, just a few slivers of mushroom and slices of bell pepper. Didn't bother to eat the crusts-- they were too hard and flavourless. Would have just given this place 1 star, but the service is at least pleasant so will be giving them 2. But overall, I might as well have gone to Pizza Iolo."}
