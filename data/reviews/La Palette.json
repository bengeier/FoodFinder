{"text":"Was expecting to be better than what zagat rated it for. Nothing special but not over priced.  It is what it is. Not exceptional."}
{"text":"I have been there on several trips to Toronto, always wonderful .  I was there last weekend with friends who had not been, they liked lunch there so well that they insisted that we do brunch there the next day."}
{"text":"A group of about 10 of us made a reservation for a late Saturday night rendez vous. For most of us, it was our first time there, upon the recommendation of two of our friends who have been visiting the restaurant on regular intervals over the last few years. We (my fiancee and I) were only planning on having a few drinks and then heading home, but we decided to try some of the food since it was raved about so much.   Well, the portions are small. Which, in reality, isn't an issue for me if the quality is there. I had \"Le Végéterién,\" ($26) consisting of bland, tasteless lentils, a forgettable celeriac purée, and tasty (but very few) roasted mushrooms. I am not one to leave food (especially when there is so little to begin with), but I did not finish the lentils, and I have to say that I made better while in the height of my undergraduate degree when I literally had no time for cooking.  The service was mediocre for the type of restaurant they claim to be. We ordered a 1/2 litre of red for $40. The waiter brought us one clean, polished glass and one wet glass that had just come out of the dishwasher. We quickly grabbed it to wipe the water out of the inside before he poured the wine... he then proceeded to make a comment about how WE almost ruined the wine by leaving some paper napkin in the cup (YES... they only us PAPER napkins... so cheap). We then told him that we didn't want to ruin the wine with the water from the cup and he began lecturing us about how he was actually doing us a favour because the glass was too hot and he cooled it down for us. Maybe so... but you still polish the glass. I've had better wine service in a sports bar.   All of that was topped off with a horrible conversation with the owner, Shamez. We disagreed with how he treated one of our friends at the table and politely told him so on our way out (we left before the rest of the group). He showed no sign of concern and basically told me that his restaurant is too high class for people like us and that he is amazing.  Sorry, Shamez, but you have nothing special to offer. Customer service goes a long way, especially when your food and service are subpar."}
{"text":"Good french food . Good place for a date. My boyfriend and I like the foie gras, the magret de canard (when they offer it), and the steak frites. I have yet to try the quack n track. Overall, a yummy french restaurant and good for a casual date night."}
{"text":"i have of late despaired of finding a toronto restaurant on Queen with a friendly bar and a nice atmosphere. Thankfully I wandered into La Palette randomly a few weeks ago. Nice bistro setup, and fantastic owner working the bar. Old fashioned friendliness and good service is vastly underrated in this city. I'll be back very soon to try the food because of my positive drinking experience."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and vibe of this place! Great service team and tantalizing menus. I've been a few times, each time the service has been exceptional and just reading the food menu makes my mouth orgasm (the food itself is mind-blowing). Not to mention the drinks list, which is worth the 5 stars alone!  Having lived in Vancouver, Montreal, Germany, and Peru, and having always been a foodie, I can definitely tell you this place is worth checking out.  Try this place out. Bring a friend. It's a must."}
{"text":"I loved this place, had the quake and track. The cheval was perfectly cooked, man it was tasty. My stomach is likely to rumble next time I see a beautiful horse prance in the field.  The vanilla brandy ice cream was good and the whole dinner is priced right at the upper level of reasonable.  Constructive criticism include:  Slight improvement in decorum to  parallel the excellent food, this was my wife's suggestion, I didn't mind it since I only go to taste the art not look at the walls or furniture.  The creme brule  could have a thicker crust but that's just a personal preference.  But most importantly the oysters must, must, must be on ice, not so much  to cool the meat but to cool the brine juice. Many Toronto restaurants are guiltily of serving their oysters warm and if elected  Mayor I will impose a civil law to have this practice made a criminal offence.  I will definitely go back to this place though.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"La Palette is a small unpretentious restaurant on Queen St. It's dimly lit and gives off a very cozy and romantic feeling. Great atmosphere with service staffs that are very friendly and informative about daily specials and recommendations.  I initially came to this restaurant for a birthday dinner with some close friends and was not disappointed. The food was amazing. Simple yet rich in flavour and extremely tasty! The escargots were DELICIOUS, baked in mushrooms and garlic sauce - it was a great way to start the meal. For my entrée I tried the 'Cheval' and it was orgasmic - very juicy/tender inside while maintaining a crisp outside without being overly cooked, I just wish the piece of meat wasn't so small :'(  Overall it was a great dinner and an amazing night. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that would like to try French cuisine or is looking for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Great staff, delicious food. I brought my wife here to introduce her to French cuisine and they did not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and great service. The soup of the day was to die for and the main courses were scrumptious. My girlfriend got a Confit de Canard and I got a Poulet. The food was quite heavy and we had a hard time finishing it but it was delicious till the last bite. We got a lemon tart for dessert which was average, but hey the food was the main reason we were there. The servers were also really relaxed and did not pressure us to order and showed the right etiquette.   All in all- we ended up paying ~$100 for the two of us with a couple of glasses of wine. I would recommend anyone especially if you are going on a date or an anniversary. Its not just a couples spot- the atmosphere is great to meet with a few close friends or a small group."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the downtown core. Went there for an engagement celebration, and had the chance to try a number of dishes. Everything I had was amazing. You really can't go wrong. Some dishes you have to be adventurous for (horse meat) but why go to a restaurant if you don't want to experiment?  The atmosphere is very unpretentious, something rare in Toronto these days. Great place for a date or just a night out for good food."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!  I came here for a Christmas get together with a great friend and we both really liked it.  It has a very comfy, boho kind of feel with really good, well cooked, food.  There's a real mix of customers too - all ages, all types of people.    I had the chicken dinner that came with some sort of bread pudding which was fantastic and then some brussel sprouts.  I didn't have an appetizer or dessert but they all looked really good and judging from what other people around us ordered, it looked like everything was great.  What I liked the most is that it was quite busy and yet, we didn't feel rushed at all.  We spent a fair bit of time there and the waiter didn't push us out at all.  Great place to spend an evening!"}
{"text":"This place was a great yelp find!   My Mom just arrived in town and she was thinking of just going to the Keg. I, however, was looking to try something new and decided on a cute French place close to the hotel. This place was a winner!  I thought I would be disappointed with the brunch/lunch menu, but everything was perfect.   We started with the foie gras and a bottle of the Malbec (Mi Terruño, I think?). Then we each decided to take the 2/3 prix fixe (with the plan to share everything). We ended up getting the escargots, the burger, and the Quack of Dawn (ducks egg served inside a duck sausage contraption. Delicious!  The only bad comment that we both had (which, to be honest, is mostly our fault) was that the food is super rich. Never the less, we ate every bit of the brandy icecream. :D"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, bloody expensive though. Service was great, live music, friendly cosy atmosphere. I got the vegetarian option which was heavenly, hands down some of the best meat free fare I've ever had, my boyfriend had the lamb stew which he said was equally fantastic. Good wine and beer list, creme brule was delicious but minuscule (2 bites?) as it was on a prix fixe option.  Expect to spend $140 for two with booze, but it was well worth the expense."}
{"text":"What a cozy little spot!!! I just loved this place from the decor, the music, the lighting, and the staff. I celebrated my 5th wedding anniversary here and couldn't have been happier. Everyone was so friendly and the food was absolutely delicious! My husband and I got the prix-fixe which was definitely worth the price as most everything on the menu seemed to be included which was nice (Definitely try the escargot for the appetizer, yum!) We also ordered a bottle of house wine for $35 which is as reasonable as you're going to get in most restaurants.  My only complaint was that the tables were a bit too close together which is fine, I suppose, depending on who you're sitting beside. It made me feel like I had to keep my voice down the entire night though. I also ended up feeling really sorry for the guy sitting next to me with another couple who would not stop talking about their wedding and honeymoon for the entire evening! ;)  Overall it was a wonderful atmosphere and a great restaurant. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A co-worker of my wife's told us about this French restaurant, and having had great French back in Vancouver at Les Faux Bourgois we were looking for a Toronto equivalent, and we think we succeeded.  We managed to have an early dinner on a Sunday before there was a single person there to eat, so we sat down immediately and were watched over by the very friendly staff all night. My wife and I both went with the fixed menu and enjoyed every course, from appetizer to dessert. We walked away very happy people, ready to go back whenever the desire for French food strikes us."}
{"text":"Party of four on a Tuesday night, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Toronto has a lot of fancy and expensive restaurants, many of which, I feel, don't deliver either a unique experience or good value. La Palette gets it right, beginning with the atmosphere. Good bistro feel, with a laid back but attentive approach to service. We were presented with the wine list, and our server was obviously an enthusiast...she not only was able to describe the different offerings, we were welcome to try anything on the list before making a final selection. Turns out our initial choice was not as good as our second, so we were able to hone in on a winner. The menu is varied, and carries such real bistro fare as chevalier, hare and duck. The appetizers, Brie in a crust and snails, were a touch over done, with the brie running out and the snails a bit dry, however when we brought the snails to the server's attention, apparently it is a style of cooking you either love or you don't. The mains, however, were fantastic. A rack of lamb you could cut with a knife, a pressed chicken dish that made our toes curl, and black cod that was the best ever tasted. Presentation was simple but attractive, and the service the the right level of care. We finished off with two desserts shared; the clear winner a lemon tarte that was just right in its tartness and flakiness of crust. Dinner for two with a glass of wine each, around $100 not including tip. Definitely on the \"\"go back\" list, if only to see if they can knock it out of the park again with different selections. Parking tip...just east of the restaurant, north of Queen is a municipal lot. Parking on Queen is not easy to find."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner with my hubby and parents on a Sunday night. The service was excellent from the very start, the food was incredible. I got the steak which was cooked as requested (something that happens so rarely), my husband got a sablefish which was also cooked perfectly. Overall - it's a great place with excellent food."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant. The  first night I was there seemed to be packed with regulars who all knew each other. Recommendation flowed between customers at different tables with a big push for the game meats. While I wasn't 'racing' to try the horse, several other customers were recommending it.  Other great thing is they are a BYOW restaurant. They have a $25 corkage fee which is the same as their markup, as far as I can tell, on wines and they are very happy to see people bring in their own wines.  In closing, great spot and I wish it was in my neighbourhood because it place you could keeping going back to..."}
{"text":"Excellent food in an atmosphere very much like a little french bistro in Paris - that is, loud and crowded.  A great choice for a fine bistro meal and bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant!  Discovered them yesterday for a late lunch on recommendation from a friend and went back for dinner today. We all had different items, and we all lived then so I can't imagine anything on the menu not being terrific!  Service was great too :-)  Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for reveling at the top of the food chain. Delicious meats such as braised bison cheeks, cheval tenderloin, elk, and caribou. No worries though there are options for the vegetarian in your party too! Phenomenal attention to detail and the open kitchen let's you observe the highly skilled chefs in action."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at la palette. I called the restaurant weeks in advance for a large party reservation and the manager and I hit it off! When I told him of my large party, request for a set menu and separate billing all he asked for was a call a few days before to confirm numbers. I thought wow, this is great service and I haven't even sat down to eat yet. The evening arrived and my party was warmly welcomed and the service was great. Did I mention the food was amazing?  As you read earlier I requested for a set menu but when reviewing the menu online and reading other yelp reviews I had to try the horse which wasn't on the set menu...thankfully our server had no issue with me ordering off of the regular menu and the horse was delicious, tender and not at all gamy.  I love this place and will definitely be back. Thanks for a successful evening la palette!"}
{"text":"Living in Kensington Market, La Palette was a little slice of Europe in my backyard.  Now it's moved to Queen St W, the quality of the food has suffered.   Admittedly, it was an extremely busy Sunday night of a long weekend.  The tables were full so my husband and I sat at the bar.  Service was super friendly, and as quick as can be expected when the restaurant is maxed out.   We ordered the green salad to share.  It was lackluster and skimpy.  The two pieces of bread that came to the table were burnt on both sides.   My husband ordered the duck confit (his favourite dish).  He said it was okay but a little dry.  The spaetzel was watery and not very flavourful. I ordered the wild boar dish.  The smoked pork belly roll was amazing.  However, the striploin of boar was dry and tasteless and required too much bland chewing to enjoy.  Also, the potato salad was just ok.   When speaking with the bar man (owner?) he said the weekends were super busy now that they had moved but that during the week they had time to really spoilt their guests.  That may be, but when I'm spending over $100 on a meal for two, I don't want excuses, and my experience of your restaurant is based on right now, not a promise for next time.   Overall, this was a disappointment and we won't be going back or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"I went because I wanted to eat horse (which was delicious). Everything else ended up being very good as well."}
{"text":"If today is Sunday, it must be time for brunch... so I picked my sweety up after choir and surprised her with a visit to La Palette.  Somehow I had managed to not even know about this place until I walked by it for the 100th or so time... and today we went.  The table across from us was empty, and then a sharply-dressed woman sat, ordered and began to read Walrus (taking notes, I might add). Coffee and desert were brought to her table which she finished, then paid her bill and left. I don't know why this was significant, but it struck me as perfect. One of my best memories of Paris is of watching a woman eat a sandwich on a bench in a park, and today was as pleasurable as that long-ago event.  Oh sure, the map of Paris on the wall across form us was a pretty big cue, but without the cast there is no play, correct? Props and scenery are great, but you need actors to bring it to life (unless it's Ed & Nancy... ). I had the Omelette Espagnole with Frites and K had a Benedict with Bacon.  Ordinarily I am a hot sauce junkie, but today I ate breakfast as it was delivered. Good decision, let me tell you. Though the egg was cooked more than I prefer, the subtlety of the chorizo and the herbs in the eggs were wonderful... the frites were perfectly done and, even rarer, perfectly salted. I only realized as I write this that there was no toast or other bready goodness (not supposed to be, I simply did not miss it), so that makes a good breakfast.  The place is very nicely laid out, long bar along one side and open kitchen across from it. There is seating up front and again at the back, close but not crowded. the staff were very friendly, and even though it was quite crowded service was attentive and the food was prompt.  Okay, I do not make it a habit of watching women eat in public, I swear. In fact, I cannot think of any other times I have done so. I promise.... but for some reason both of these people were compelling and I am fortunate to have noticed them.  We have already decided that we will be returning for dinner at some point, and that alone is making me hungry."}
{"text":"walking by this restaurant, always curious, my friend and I decided to go have a glass wine. we started to drink two glasses wine then ordered escargot, and foie gras. escargot was good, different way cooked. however foie gras was cold inside, made us  have no more than bit. Wine lists had good choices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The small space and eclectic artwork give it a unique ambiance and a French feel. The spacing is tight, but I've never been bothered by the proximity to other diners. The owner is always there interacting with you and he is definitely proud of and attentive to his establishment. His chef is skilled enough to deliver consistently great culinary experiences year after year.  Their french onion soup is one of the best I've ever had because they don't make the cheese the focus and use bison stock to give it a uniquely rich flavour. They also do game meat very well. I recently tried their venison and horse, with the latter being surprisingly tender. Their wine selection is not large but is well composed.  I could go on and on about the little things I enjoy about La Palette, but I'd rather leave it to you to explore it for yourself knowing that you won't be let down.  PS: If you're into it, try the strawberry wheat beer."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Shamez and his head chef Brook. They've recently opened this new location on Queen St. W. in order to expand the market they can reach with their flair for French Bistro cuisine.  For those who know the brand as well as the new comers: you'll love the new joint. Open and airy with high ceilings, a skylight, and an original full-length brick wall to one side, you simply can't deny the charm of this eclectic space. The building served as a barn and was built in 1880 and a lot of that vintage design has been carried over. The art and posters are as quirky as ever, and the atmosphere is open yet intimate. This is helped by the small two-seater tables and completely mismatching chairs dotting the back of the restaurant (where you have seated meals).  That area is roughly similar in size as the original restaurant, but the new space has an amazing entrance that houses a long curved bar around which you'd mingle, and a totally open kitchen that showcases the gastronomic magic of this restaurant.  Of course, in the end, that's why you're there. The food is delicious. The menu is similar to the old establishment but there are some new items too. Expect to see your favorite game meats.  Thus far, I've only tried one item off of the brunch menu: eggs benedict on crispy bacon combined with horseradish sitting on rye bread with a mixed green salad. This is a must eat dish. The open kitchen design is brilliant in the fact that it lets you sense the aromas of your dish and build up mouth watering anticipation before being able to dig in.  Mimosas with fresh orange juice helped wash down the delectable meal and we walked away not feeling overly stuffed or light in the pocket. $50 (ex. tip) for 2.  I highly recommend La Palette (South) along with its sister restaurant in Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. If my cholesterol weren't already borderline, I'd probably never stop eating here. My wife and I went - she had a prix fixe, I ordered a la carte. I had the venison tartare, which I'm absolutely going back for - with an egg yolk sorbet on top, it was a huge rush of raw fatty amazingness. I also had the sea bream, which was cooked textbook-perfect, light, flaky with the perfect crunchy crust outside. My wife had escargot, duck confit, and goat cheese for dessert - I nibbled off her plate, and everything she had was just as perfect. Our waiter (I wish I'd caught his name, olive-complected dude with an odd haircut) was charming, endlessly helpful, and very accommodating, especially when it came to my wife's egg allergy, which can be a stumbling point at a French restaurant. We had wine with our dinner (the waiter gave us a deal on an open bottle), but I noted the beer list as another reason to return - it looked great."}
{"text":"From the solitary table with a fluttering tablecloth sitting outside the restaurant displaying the menu, to the dim and cozy ambiance, this place is on my list of fave restaurants in the city.  Uh-Mazing.  My hubby and I decided to try this place out as we were looking for a new dining experience in the city. We were able to get same-day reservations and when making them, were told exactly where we would be sitting. It meant nothing to us at the time as we'd never been there before, but if we had, it would have been useful to know where we'd be sat.  I love the creative use of old Moulin Rouge books which hold the wine lists. Not sure what wine you'd like to order. Tasting is encouraged :) Not sure what to order off the food menu, the staff will break it down for you and explain it all. We started with the Escargots La Palette - Marinated escargots sauteed with morels, leeks, baby spinach, spinach, torn croutons, & lemon-dill beurre blanc. For my main, I had the Sanglier - Ouraboaros (Manitoba) - Pan roasted wild boar tenderloin, mine was medium, boar belly stuffed duck neck and confit head (which initially kind of turned me off from ordering it, but I was so curious I had to do it), roasted chestnut, celery root, apple, parsnip and red cabbage w/ maple mustard jus. I seriously had to close my eyes and allow the flavour, texture and awesomeness of the boar belly stuffed duck neck to really be experienced. It was a foodgasm.   My hubby had one of the specials; Mixed Grill - Wild Boar and Venison with truffled chanterelle oat risotto, winter vegetables and a blueberry-juniper demi 3-piece add Musk-ox. Also incredible. For dessert we had the3-combo Crême Brulée - Vanilla, Absinthe and Cinnamon Espresso. Surprisingly, my favourite was the good ol' vanilla. All three were amazing though - let's be honest, it's creme brulee!  Only reason I didn't give it five stars, was because I would have given it 4.5 if I could. It was the washrooms. With so much effort put into the decor, menu and quality of food, I totally expected a washroom that was nice, updated - or at least in line with the rest of the decor. They're clean, but I felt dirty going down into the basement and into the shady stalls.  All in all - The menu is intriguing and encourages you to try something new. The staff is superb. The owner is incredibly warm and welcoming. The music, authentic. If you see the rickshaw out on the street, make sure you step inside to be whisked away to Paris for a few hours.  La Pallette, nous reviendrons."}
{"text":"The best brunch in Kensington Market.  Most romantic spot for dinner."}
{"text":"I am going to have to go against the grain.  I tried to like it, I really did. Especially since my friend was already busting my chops for choosing La Palette instead of another establishment in the area.   To begin, we ordered the Pinot Noir. The wine was acceptable, but not very good said my accompanying wine aficionado. I thought it was okay. Next came the bread basket. TWO slivers of toasted old baguette. Not warm, and with a texture reminiscent of crackers. The real kicker was when I asked for more...the server returned with exactly two more shavings of the same stale bread! It could only get better from there.   First were the appetizers. I had the Salade Verte which was pretty good, I liked the vinaigrette and the salad was in proper order. My friend had the Escargots La Palette which was rather blah. Not to mention the escargot was too dry and tough.    For the entree I had the Mixed Grill with horse and venison, whilst my amiga had the canard de confit. Now, the bright spots of the evening WERE the horse and venison. Both were moist, cooked to medium rare and very tasty! It is too bad they were not warm when they reached the table. The Canard de Confit was another story. I know plenty of yelpers have raved about the duck, but when compared with the equivalent dish at Le Sélect it left a lot to be desired. The skin was not crisp, a touch too much fat was present on the leg and the accompanying noodles were bland and corny.   Dessert time! We shared the Tarte au Citrons. Who am I kidding? My friend was not enthused about eating anymore La Palette fare (but she did take my wine), so I was forced to put on a brave face and eat the tart. I did not even finish it. The crust was too doughy and very marginal for the price being paid.   That said, the atmosphere was okay and our server tried to be as helpful as possible. Though the owner could use some PR training."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, niece, friend and I had the pleasure of eating here for the first time last Saturday.  I fell in love the minute I walked through the door as Edith Piaf was playing on the stereo and the tables were decked out with tablecloths from Provence.  I felt like I was back in France.  The evening was perfect from beginning to end.  The food was absolutely spectacular, as was the service that we received.   For anyone wanting a little piece of France, this is the perfect place to go and a lot less expensive than flying across the ocean!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were entertaining a friend last night and we were conflicted about where to take him for dinner.  We could have done the ubiquitous corporate dining experience and have been satisfied with mediocrity but chose instead to walk over from the office.  We dined earlier than we normally do - the restaurant was nearly empty - which meant some of the eclectic buzz we are used to was missing.  As usual the food was very good and the service outstanding.  A highlight as usual was the journey through the wine and spirits with the expert guidance of the bar staff.  And the \"pop up\" music was appreciated.  A great experience ....again"}
{"text":"Incredible! The Parisian ambiance, service, visible kitchen, and most importantly food were phenomenal. It was a perfect dining experience. The dishes were so flavorful and the meats were perfectly cooked. The prix fixe option was a nice choice. The dishes are rich so pace yourself but more importantly enjoy. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, lovely service and wonderful wine selection. Like being in France, except at a restaurant with a bar."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here for New Years pre-fixe brunch. I'm glad that there's a place that is open on actual New Years.   The food was good. Wasn't mind blowing, but I did enjoy the food.   For appetizer I had the Paté de campagne. I'm not a paté connoisseur but it tasted like it should.   For main I had the Steak Haché, which is really just a steak burger. It was very big and filling, and tasted good.  For dessert I had the Green Tea Crême Brulée which was bit small, but just the right size after being super full from the burger.   The servers were good. The atmosphere was lovely and I enjoyed that they played French music. The decor was very exquisite. The only thing was that it was bit pricey, but that's expected if you go to a nice French place.   All in all, recommend it and would come here again."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows how to order french service should try eating here. If you're not familiar, stay away because you'll complain about the price, not knowing that what you're being charged for is true excellence."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, disappointing food. There are better places to go for French food at the same price, or cheaper."}
{"text":"Let me just clarify that this review is almost entirely centered around this restaurant's customer service, as I unfortunately didn't even get the opportunity to eat there. I'm not one to go and write reviews for many places I go to, so it should really say something that I still feel it necessary to share some kind words about this restaurant and the people who work there.  To make a long story short as to how I ended up here without even eating, I was in Toronto very briefly - only a Sunday and Monday night - for work. I had eaten at a restaurant near my hotel but wanted to find somewhere to try some Cuban rum. (I'm from the US, and we can't import Cuban products because then the Soviets would win, obviously. Psh...)  Anyhow, I was told to try the Queen Street West area, and I stumbled upon La Palette after a few other failed attempts. My first impression when walking in there was \"Awesome decor!\" The place has a very relaxed, vintage French vibe going on. If I lived in Toronto, this would definitely be a spot I'd take a date.  Then I got to talking with some of the employees (one of whom may have been the owner), and asked if they had any Cuban rum. They didn't, but they would find some place that did for me.  ...are you kidding?! I don't know if this is just a Canadian thing (you guys are exceptionally polite and friendly, by the way), but that was such a nice gesture. While the (suspected) owner was ringing his restaurant posse to score me some commie booze, a waitress showed me the menu, and I was really impressed. They've got some awesome game meat (horse, rabbit, etc.) on there and other French plates that looked amazing.  I then got word that my rum was about a 5 minute walk away, at which point I was given a makeshift map drawn on a napkin or something to help get me there. Toronto, as soon as I can come back to you, I will celebrate my arrival at La Palette."}
{"text":"We walked into this place by chance, and we'll surely be back.  The amazing food is distinctively French, the service is excellent in all respects, and the decor is lovely."}
{"text":"We went there with my husband's parents for early Mother's day dinner. Before going, we checked their web and menu, and looked very good. However, I didn't really realize that they were not Non-meat eater friendly restaurant. I don't eat meat, period... And my only choice for main was Bouillabaisse or Roasted Vegetable which I ordered Bouillabaisse. It was very good, lots of different kinds of seafood were in it. I loved it. Then, from next time, what can I order???!!!  If they can create one or two more non-meat dishes, I'd love to try them!!!  My husband and his parents seemed to enjoy their dishes. Mom, the wine lover loved their wine lists and was appreciated  to  be offered  a tasting before ordering.  Anyway, their dessert  dishes need to be improved. Overall, we had a very nice time."}
{"text":"A cozy smallish restaurant, where I found myself eavesdropping on the table next to us from time to time. For our appetizers we ordered foie gras and escargots. While I did enjoy the foie gras i thought the escargots were a bit too greasy, but then again it does say on the menu it's baked in garlic butter.   After much deliberation, I finally agreed to be adventurous and ordered the horse tenderloin, I was glad I did. One of the best piece of steaks I've ever had. The meat was rare, tender, juicy and lean. There is a subtle difference in taste from beef and from horse meat, but after the first few bites I started to enjoy it. My date ordered a duck confit. That dish was disappointing, the dish was a soggy mess.   For dessert we ordered a lemon tart and a vanilla creme brulee. Both desserts were disappointing. The lemon tart did not have that lemon zing to it, and the crust was mushy. The creme brulee was OK, nothing mind blowingly good. I would come back for their horse tenderloin, and maybe try other items on their menu before I write this restaurant off."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. Food is always amazing and the staff is always friendly and attentive. I recommend the horse tartar and their steak frites."}
{"text":"La Palette great food and chic atmosphere.   I have probably been to La Palette 4 or 5 times now and it has yet to disappoint. The food and service have always been excellent. La Palette is the type of place where you can easily spend the entire night chatting, sipping wine, laughing, and just purely enjoying the act of eating with others.   I have seen others comparing La Palette and Le Select. Yes they are both french restaurants, but I think beyond that the comparisons pretty much stop. The style of food at La Palette is much more country/rustic french, while Le Select is much more akin to Parisian cuisine (or at least my experience of Parisian cuisine), which is much more refined. Both offer highly accomplished food, but by no means could dishes from one be confused with dishes from the other.  Furthermore, the atmospheres of these two restaurants could not be more different. La Palette is small, dark, and eclectic (in a very charming, comforting sort of way). Le Select is open, bright, and while not formal, it certainly can't be mistaken for a casual restaurant.  So while both restaurants are french and in the same neighbourhood they offer very different experiences. Both are certainly worth checking out, but currently given the choice, I would choose La Palette."}
{"text":"Simply excellent, both food choice and wine selection!  Friendly staff and cozy decor. Well worth the visit and price, which is actually quite reasonable for this neighborhood and caliber. My compliments to the chef and management!"}
{"text":"I am shocked this place has such great reviews. Sure, it's cute and the service is good, but the food didn't blow me away. I had better food at Le Select though the service was atrocious!   Still on the hunt for a go to French restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and decorations. Lots of interesting paintings, drink menu in old book, and nice staff. I went straight for the horse tenderloin with duck thigh. the duck was extremely tender and rich. I had never had horse before and it tasted like a good cut of beef to me. They serve it rare without asking which is how it should be done. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  I really like this place and have walked by many times and always wanted to give it a try.  The staff here were super accommodating and really nice. I had the poulet - cooked perfectly and paired w the most delicious bread pudding I've ever had. I crave just that side dish.  I would have preferred the chicken to be all white meat, (it came w/ a thigh - I don't eat dark meat but did try some of it). My fiance had the steak frites.  We started w/ the fried cheese which was rich and creamy and really good. All in all, I'm not sure we'd come back as there are a lot of adventurous items on the menu that we do not eat. But I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a yummy french restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"My visit was on a cold, crisp wintery night where I was searching for a warm, cozy, comfort-food filled restaurant - La Palette hit the mark.  The ambiance is wonderful, very charming, warm and French.  The tables I found a titch on the smaller side (particularly for 2).  Service was wonderful, we were warmly welcomed and invited to sample some beers.  One great feature is the fact that all wines are available by the glass and sampling of both wine and beer is encouraged.  Unfortunately, one of the only downsides was that we were a bit disappointed to find they were out of the beers we had requested - particularly if you have a favourite type which they carry and its not in.  The bread was a sourdough rye and delicious - BUT, as a suggestion, it would be that much more amazing if served warm.  I started with the fromage fondant - fried triple creme camembert with pecans, cherries, apples etc.  The dish was a treat for the taste buds!  Absolutely delicious pairings with the crispy covered and oozing cheese.    Next I indulged further with the foie gras - pairing it with the suggested muscat.  The foie gras was delicious and buttery and a generous portion!  The toast and wild leek supplemented wonderfully although I found one of the sauce (perhaps the pan jus) to be a bit strong for my liking.  I worked around it however and the meal was absolutely delectable.  Overall, it was a great night and though there was no room for dessert I will return!"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant needs a lesson in customer service. We wanted to make reservations for a group of 15 people for my cousin's 30th birthday.  Incidentally maybe we shouldn't have said we were interested in the prix fixe.  However their response was that they would not be able to accept our reservation due to the fact that they would like to reserve their tables for patrons that were going to buy $90 bottle wines.  I am appalled that a restaurant would so blatantly be disrespectful of clientele that they have not even encountered.  Especially to a group of 15 professional adults and be that dismissive. Personally I would have opted out of the prix fixe to choose one of their more interesting dishes. I would have gladly shared a bottle of wine or two with a couple friends.  Understandably a prix fixe is not a huge money maker, so then don't put that on your menu! Or at least advise that a group over 8 (etc etc) would not be entitled to the prix fixe but we would be welcome to the regular menu if we choose."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and staff. Order meat. And please go for the more exotic types (bison, venison, boar) instead of a plain old cow steak. You might as well go to The Keg otherwise."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! Every ingredient is so carefully picked and thought out...the flavours are amazing, service is exceptional and the place is charming. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for great French fare."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.   Food: amazing  Beer menu: awesome   I ventured here after a hard night out with a large group, and they were accommodating and friendly. Staff really know their stuff.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great french style food, I had some nice snails very aromatic and a great piece of steack with real fresh fries. Smart service, thanks for that dinner experience!"}
{"text":"We walked by this place so many times andd ecided to give it a try for brunch. The food is AMAZING . The chef was a young man cooked alone and so talented. Ordered the Bacon and spinach eggs benedict, and the mushroom and spinach one.  One came with fries and the other with their house salad. Everything was perfect. The mushrooms were a different kind and so crisp and tasty. The bacon was also thick and crisp. But the hollandaise sauce was so delicious and light at the sam time. Will definitely go again. Service was great, and the wait was not very long for food"}
{"text":"My friends and I are in a bookclub and chose this as our meeting place since our book was based in France. YUMMY!! The food here is incredible. Also the ambiance makes you feel like you're in Paris.  I started off with the foie gras. It was incredible! So flavourful and melted in my mouth with each bite. It's also a fairly generous portion - I got 3 pieces.  For the main I had the Quack n' Track. It comes with duck and horse. I was a little bit nervous about trying the horse but it was delicious. Really juicy and tender. The duck wasn't as intimidating but equally good. I loved the crispy skin mmm  For dessert I had the creme brulee and it was very well done. I had the pecan (one of the daily specials)."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4 and a half stars because the several times we have been there we have always left very satisfied, almost a 5 star experience. After the first time we had dinner there we decided to return twice, the last time with a friend. We love the mussels they serve. Delicious, and with the home fries and that homemade mayonnaise... really good. The cheese try they served wasn't too bad, but one of the cheeses just looked too unappealing to us. We had a really good wine and enjoyed the night. To end, the crème brûlé tasted good but there was a little bit of gelatin in it that we can easily see. The deep dish serving didn't allow for it to warm up when the sugar was being caramelized (a small misshape). Still would recommend returning."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. Great food, great ambiance, great wine and spirit selection, great service. Shamez the owner is doing a 5 star job and is always welcoming when we arrive. It's nice to have a local spot we can enjoy and always be satisfied when we leave."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner, got the vegetarian quiche which I admit I played it a little safe considering the menu offers bison, and horse tongue. The environment is tres chic, with an eclectic vibe. Their Caesar came with quite a lot of garnishes which I am always a fan of! Definitely a must go to if you love exotic foods!"}
{"text":"Two things every customer/foodie expects: service and food quality. Both equally important in any restaurant experience. I have eaten at La Palette four times. Each time the food has been fabulous- some of my favourites are the horse tartare, escargot and bone marrow, fois gras, and duck confit. I can't promise this, but each time I've been there, the owner has stopped by our table to make sure we're happy, feeling welcome, and enjoying the meal. This place is definitely worth a visit - it hasn't disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"The hubs and I stumbled upon La Palette while walking around the neighborhood where we were staying. As we passed it, I decided I wanted to eat there for our anniversary dinner the next night. It was definitely bustling but not overly crowded, and I loved the open air set-up they have.  The next evening, we were able to be seated right away without reservations.  We ordered drinks and the guy (who we assumed was a manager) brought them over with some playful commentary (to say the least). It was entertaining. I savored the house red wine which suited me just fine.   I ordered the steak and frites, and he ordered the mussels special (right before they ran out -- great timing again!). Both were absolutely delicious. I will say my steak was a tad too salty, but it was cooked so perfectly that I almost didn't care. I just downed extra wine and water to make up for it :) The mussels were seasoned so deliciously, and they provided bread to soak up the extra juices....just divine.  We couldn't decide between desserts, so we got two (naturally). The creme brûlée and Gâteau au Chocolat (basically flourless chocolate cake). The creme brûlée was fantastic - perfectly crunchy topping with creamy insides. The chocolat was just as bitter as it was sweet -- clearly they used quality chocolate.   Overall, it was a lovely experience and very romantic dinner for our anniversary. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a classy place to dine!"}
{"text":"A wonderful, wonderful restaurant.  I will often get a prix fixe (steak, any appetizer, any dessert) for $36.  Last meal I had here was duck neck sausage served in a duck neck & head (beak attached). It was delicious and hilarious."}
{"text":"Great bar/restaurant we sat at the bar on a sunny afternoon drinking pale ale from Quebec and talking to the friendly barman Tom (from Dublin). This place has a very chilled atmosphere serving locals (a guy named trout) and tourists , it made the afternoon a great experience!  Give it a try....,"}
{"text":"Was not really impressed with the food. Had the duck leg with beans. Peasant food. However, if you are looking for authentic French food, this is the place to go. The food they serve is actually typical French. But, not all the French food should belong in a restaurant. Maybe it's just because I'm not too impressed with the French kitchen. I just think it was overpriced to pat $46 for 2 plates of simple white beans + a duck leg. Yes, it's French, is it worth it? Don't think so, it's actually a traditional peasant meal. They also served horse tenderloin. From retired race horses. Now I don't think it's necessary the best choice to eat from an old and retired race horse which they most likely used lots of drugs and antibiotics for."}
{"text":"I spied La Palette early one Sunday morning while wandering around Queen West before anything had opened. It looked so beautiful and inviting, and as a French bistro, like exactly that which I love the most. I knew I would have no time to enjoy a meal there as my partner and I only had one non-work dinner night free -- we already had reservations for that night. But, after one long day at work and an unsatisfying dinner my partner and I decided to wander over and see if we could stop in for a dinner and a drink -- and what a lovely time we had. Our bartender, a soft-spoken and lovely man, must have been the owner as he had such joy in talking with us about La Palette's fabulous array of spirits and cordials -- I love unique spirits and after dinnder drinks and La Palette's selection was truly special, less for the volume of selections, but more for their uniqueness and the obvious care with which they were all chosen. My partner started off with an aged Calvados, of which there were several from which to choose, and I started with an apricot eau-de-vie (Apricot!), and followed it with a quite remarkable chamomile grappa, mellow, pollen-y, and yellow like a late summer sun. We also ordered some desserts, Tarte au Citron, and the trio of creme brulee. Both were excellent, though the greatest joy was the pleasant atmosphere and great conversation we had with the staff and other patrons who all seemed to having as pleasant an evening as we were. It was a refuge that we greatly enjoyed,"}
{"text":"Food: 5 Service: 4 a bit slow Ambiance: 4 a bit too warm  We had the cooked foie gras, mussels and the horse/duck. All were perfectly cooked, the presentation and taste were great. Unfortunately the wine list is a bit small.  Summary: expensive but you get what you pay for. Good food selection expertly crafted, little bit light on the wine. Overall a great meal!"}
{"text":"Service was very attentive.  The frites with garlic mayo is crave inducing. Accompanied by the mussels makes this gem a great find. For out of towners this is a diamond to be discovered."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for our sixth anniversary. I ended up trying a duo of tartare dishes - the horse tartare (which was pretty good although a little bland) and the venison tartare (a bit too much spice for my tastes). My wife had the seared fois (OK) and a the horse steak (surprisingly good although the standard preparation is served very raw). Overall a decent meal with a nice, trendy atmosphere. Our waiter was also very good."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch: Lovely and casual atmosphere, Excellent food (really yummy), one of the best coffees I have ever had with brunch, very friendly server...    Note that the menu in their website is outdated and the real menu is completely different and kind of pricier!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the food here.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because they can do with some upgrading in the furniture, since the little rickety tables and chairs do not complement the divine food they serve.  This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city, hands down.  While it is not featured in Winterlicious/Summerlicious, it has plenty of fans and does not need that form of advertising.  The food is french fare at its best - I usually like getting the prix fixe meal which comes with appetizer, main course and dessert.  I like the escargot for the appetizer and then move on to ordering the steak frites for my main, but I also opt to add foie gras on top of my steak. I recommend this to anyone looking to add an extra bit of indulgence to their delicious meal because their foie gras is mouthwatering.  Service here is pleasant and professional, no complaints.  The wine is also great, as they have pages and pages devoted to wine.  The desserts here however, are above average at best - I haven't found any particular dessert to recommend, however the main courses are so good that it makes up for this."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until a friend took me there for dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. The wine selection is great, I had the wild boar, and it was absolutely amazing. Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"My dad was in town and willing to take me out to a nice dinner so I thought- La Palette! It was the perfect place to take my far from trendy father, given that is classic french food in a relatively relaxed, cute environment. He entered and immediately started speaking French with the chef. I need not interview anyone because now I know such intimate details like how the chef only serves fish on the day he receives a fresh haul.     With that, we felt confident to order \"Saucisson de Mer\", a shrimp chorizo stuffed in calamari, breaded and fried with squid ink bread crumbs, over a tampenade of green olives and tomato caper ragout. First of all, the shrimp chorizo must be tasted. It has the smokiness of chorizo sausage but with the delicate succulence of shrimp instead of meat. The calamari held the package together well while the bread crumbs were a little looser. They were a nice crunch, still inviting despite their black colouring. Add in the stewed tomato ragout, with a hint of green olive and the bite was incredible. There was smoke, sourness from the caper, luscious seafood contrasted by the earthy coating.     Next came our mains, and I must say, I outdid myself with my ordering skills. I got the \"Quack 'n' Track\", a cleaver play on the surf and turf. But instead of traditional steak and lobster, it was duck and horse. It was my first time trying horse and I'm hooked. It tasted liked a richer, more tender version of steak. There was wonderful sear on the meat and it was cooked to a medium rare, closer to the edge of rare. I've had duck before but have never been this impressed by the bird. The meat was perfection, almost falling apart and moist with a crispy yet juicy skin. I was in heaven and filling up fast. The sides cannot be ignored, a grain risotto with chanterelle mushrooms strewn throughout. The texture of the various grains against the smooth broth that oozed around the plate was ridiculously good. Perfectly cooked seasonal vegetables accompanied for a welcome freshness among the heaps of hearty meat and flavours that were already piled.     Apparently it all wasn't enough because dessert was ordered, a very beautiful chocolate torte. It was dense and reminded me of a brownie but a nutty, expensive, dark chocolate one.  The little sliced fruits on the side were as cute as they were helpful for a sweetness break. With the fresh whipped cream, with the raspberry and mango sauces, it was a well worth it end to the meal. With a cappuccino on the side, I might as well have been in France."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The service, ambiance and food were fantastic. The portion sizes are huge. We did the price fixe menu and it worked out perfectly."}
{"text":"Had one of my most favourite dining experiences of the year and possibly my life. Was entertaining a friend who was visiting out of town and we stopped at La Palette. So there was four of us and it was busy on a Saturday evening in October. However, the owner gave us a glass of champagne to wait with while he figured something out. Once he found us a seat, we were able to sit and enjoy the amazing food. Everything from duck, to my appetizer of Indian/French infused mussels for the big seafood fan I am, to the main of my rare steak, was so deliciously decadent. It was fine dining at a very reasonable price and portions. We then were treated again, I might add, to shots with the owner and bartender to finish off a lovely evening. There was nothing more to say. La Palette is simply the best!!!"}
{"text":"I am French.  I was raised in France and this restaurant brings back all the comfort of my culinary experiences while growing up.  Unlike most restaurants, la palette understands how to use fresh herbs and spices, while not over salting the dishes.   I recommend any soup they offer. The best tartare is elk (elk is delicious and savory whether cooked or raw). Wild boar is a satisfying comfort food.  The hot chocolate cake is good but maybe a little too sweet. Excellent palette cleansers: house made 'not too sweet' sorbets: pear, lemongrass, Clementine, etc..."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a friend for brunch. I had the eggs benedict with bacon. Surprisingly, it was served with spinach as well as bacon. I like spinach, I was just surprised and I don't think spinach and bacon are the best pairing. The bacon was delicious.  I asked for a soft poach on my eggs and one egg was perfect, but the other had a not quite set white, which is kind of icky. Also, my eggs were pretty cool. I think they poached my eggs too soon before the rest of the food was done so that's why they were so cool in temp. The fries and salad on the side were fine.   Service wasn't the best. The guy forgot milk for my friend's tea and had to be reminded a couple times."}
{"text":"Cute little French place. Lots of selection for tartare, my favorite! I even had a horse tartare which I've never seen or eaten before. The service was average and the decor wasn't the greatest either. Would recommend for fans of French food since choices are slim in Toronto."}
{"text":"Le Prix Fixe, s'il vous plaît!  On Queen West, this is a nice casual spot to grab a French Bistro dinner. The service is friendly and we were seated at a small table at the back.  I liked the poster artwork on the walls, but the tablecloths and decor was very outdated and borderline unappealing.  Also, I did find the tables a bit close together, but at least I can check out what's on my neighbor's plate.  The service was okay, but nothing notable.  They had a list of specials but we were there for the Prix Fixe ($33) that included an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  There were several options for appetizer including mussels and escargot. They escargot was surprisingly good.  There were bits of spinach and crispy croutons in a butter sauce that wasn't saucy.  The entree I ordered was the steak frites. My 6oz steak was perfectly cooked.  The garlic butter and shallots were just awesome with the steak!  Completely enjoyable!  The dessert wasn't all that fantastic. I ordered the chocolate almond flourless torte. Fresh from the fridge, it was chocolately but had a strange aftertaste I didn't quite like.  Also, I wished that they had more of a selection of French wines, for a French bistro.  Overall, I didn't have a bad meal here but there's not enough \"ooh-la-la\" to bring me back."}
{"text":"Meh.I don't understand the hype of some of the reviews here. I felt that it was mediochre, nothing spectacular. Maybe it was an off night. I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Really like the vibe here and was surprised their main vegetarian lentil dish was delicious too! Also the lemon tarte was yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while shopping the eclectic area known as Queen St West in Toronto. Was not disappointed! Awesome ambiance. Great drinks - I had the Elvis Juice and St. Ambroise and neither disappointed. My partner recommends the Radeberger Pilsner, it's like a fancy Coors Light. We wanted to share a light lunch or app, so we ordered the sandwich of the day: grilled croissant with goat cheese, bacon, and spinach. It was delicious, like a French BLT Croque Monsieur. The fries were crispy and were served with a yummy aioli. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the horse! I went to eat dinner here a while ago while visiting Toronto, and despite my love for the beautiful animal- the horse was amazing!!  Everything else was delicious too. It is a lovely restaurant, but it can be pricy if you aren't careful. If you're in the area and you love great French cuisine, make a night of it and head to Queen Street. Those of you from my home town of Louisville, KY- don't plan on watching the KY Derby again with out thinking of this place!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this authentic french restaurant literally by accident.  Here's what I ended up ordering:  - Fromage Fondant to start - Steak/Frites for the main - Creme Brulee as a desert.  I had a couple pints of Cheval Bleu as well.   All in all, fantastic! Food was deliciously prepared. The chefs cook out in the open in the main dining room so you can literally watch your food get made. Everything is fresh. The quality is really up there.   The service was 5/5. Quick, helpful and friendly.   So glad I found this place. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cute French restaurant in a neat area. The service was very friendly and passionate, and even did an impromptu wine testing for us when we weren't sure which bottle to order.   We ordered the steak, Poisson fish, and Horse steak, and all were excellent. The Tomato jam with the steak was a perfect blend.   For dessert we had the creme brûlée trio, and lemon tart and both were great and well accompanied by the port."}
{"text":"Their new location is certainly more apt for this perfectly pleasant french bistro. The old spot, at the outskirts of Kensington felt strange for a place which boasts such a traditional french menu. The open concept kitchen is great, and gives the place an exciting and intimate feel. The tables and chairs seem kind of cheap, as if they were going for rustic but ended up ghetto instead. But the reason you go is for the food.  We had the pheasant to start which was succulent and full flavored. We then both had steak frites, and this is where the place shines. I'm not sure if it's grilled or pan seared in cast iron (the more traditional method) but it's damn fine and the shoestring fries are delish.   It was a fun night, and apart from some gentleman who seemed to want to play romantic guitar (read: my absolute nightmare) it was perfectly pleasant experience. The only 'but' to all this is that for the price - it could be better."}
{"text":"La Palette is an unassuming, dimly lit French restaurant known for its horse tenderloin (hello, what?!)  The restaurant has character inside; it really is the definition of my kind of restaurant. It's dimly lit, cozy and pretty romantic. A red brick interior wall, high ceilings and an array of interesting things on the walls like a horses head, some interesting pictures, and variety of odd knick knacks. The servers are all dressed quite casually but most of the clientele are dressed up.   The food was to die for.  Before every meal comes warm soft fresh bread served with olive oil for dipping.  The French onion soup was flavourful without being too salty with a sharp rich cheese.   The Fromage Fondant (fried Camembert) is an absolute MUST. This stuff is sinful and delicious to the max and the maple-glazed pumpkin seeds that come with it are beautifully presented and surprisingly great.  Horse tenderloin. I was a bit nervous about this one, but if you can wrap your head around the fact you're eating horse, it's like the most tender steaks you have ever eaten (not gamey at all). Truly, we ordered this medium rare and once you got through the charred outer crust your knife cuts through the meat like butter. YUM! (You HAVE to order this when you come here...)  We also ordered the Confit de Canard, the safe option, which was equally delicious.   The Bottle of Organic Pinot Noir we had was perfect. We were offered the option of tasting the wines before we purchases a bottle since they serve everything by the glass,  1/2 bottle and bottle.   The service was quick, a bit casual and friendly as can be. There are two main seating's 6:00-6:30 and 8:30-9. (There were also people coming in around 11:30, this place is open late!)  Honestly, I couldn't have asked for more from this restaurant. As we say in French:  C'est Incroyable!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Don't usually order steak as can make it at home but the pesto on top was an amazing addition. Escargot was prepared in a way I've never had- the best way! And husband's duck dish was divine- though what it sat on top of could be improved including shelling the large Fava / Butter Beans. Great ambiance- relaxed, french country side, intimate."}
{"text":"On Friday night, I saw. On Sunday morning I went. I waited til Tuesday to review and missed my FTR!  Alas, I have been to La Palette for brunch and will return for dinner this week. I've only been to the old location for dinner because who needs to walk more than a block for weekend brunch? Now with the new location, I get to experience the exquisite brunch that was put together in the old Taro Grill locale.  With the same open kitchen and long bar with seating at the front and a group of small tables at the back, La Palette will be an even more entertaining experience. To watch the chefs strut their stuff out in the open will be so exciting!  The staff remain super friendly and the beer selection is coming together nicely with McAuslan on tap.   We're going back for the bison and Talouti. Any surprises and I'll let you know."}
{"text":"La Palette serves what Top Chef folks aspire to make. Yet, they are able to keep local food on the menu and not rely on French/American imports.   For dinner on a Friday night, La Palette was cozy, so full the room was hot despite the freezing weather outside. The Staff were super friendly. They obviously know a lot of the regulars.  The wine list is extensive, but the beers on tap are more extensive and offer a more unique selection than any bar I know.   On the menu tonight was a new vegetarian entree, but too similar to what I eat at home.  So, I got the house-smoked Lake Huron Trout with panko-encrusted egg and this lucious leek and potato thing all together this was 10 star-worthy.  On the other side of the table was the meat-lover's dream, with no cow in sight.  Bison-cheeks with bacon as an appetizer, and Wild Boar (Manitoba) and Caribou (Nunavit).  The boar won rave reviews, but the caribou was still 5 stars.   The only down side was the dessert. As most good chefs don't love to do desserts, La Palette was no different. The Tarte au citron was too tart, but I was full anyway.   With plenty to drink, bill was about $60 per person plus tax and tip.  Prix Fixe is just $32, but no boar on that menu."}
{"text":"We dropped in for dessert with high hopes that we're not really fulfilled. Overall the ok rating is driven by the reasonable prices, quick service and average desserts (taste and selection)"}
{"text":"In planning our trip to Toronto, I asked my husband if he had any requests. In this case, he did have one: he wanted to try horse meat, since it's available in Canada and not the United States. So I found this spot which (as far as I could tell) is one of two places in Toronto that serves horse. And it's even on the brunch menu, which worked well with our plans.  We walked in here one Sunday morning before a baseball game (that ended up being great for Blue Jays fans, but not for me, as my precious Astros lost 9-2), settled into a table near the back, and ordered mimosas. The ones here are a little pricey but definitely worth it because they use wonderful fresh juice (which seems to be rare these days). Then we both got the benedict with horse tenderloin. Maybe one of us should have gotten something else to contrast and compare, but it was time for ADVENTURE!  What a delicious adventure it was. It is true that hollandaise makes everything better, the horse meat was delicious and tender like butta. I probably could have eaten two servings because it was so amazing. I'd like to have some for brunch this week, but I'm almost 2,000 miles away now, so that's not going to work.  Maybe I'm just going to have to come back to Toronto so I can have it again. Can we make that happen?"}
{"text":"Went to this place on the basis of Yelp reviews and the fact that I wanted great food but not necessarily the Canoe or other super-fine dining experience.  Also, I love the buzz of Kensington market.  I certainly got buzz.  Upon entering, my server told me that they were expecting an anti-horsemeat protest in 30 minutes and that they wanted to warn customers who might want to reconsider.  \"Neigh,\" said I.  \"Feed me.\"  (Okay, I didn't say neigh but it's a better story that way).  Small place - main floor of a house.  Kinda like Grandma's, if Grandma lives in the south of France.  Dining alone, I sat beside the bookshelf and browsed through a book on sausage-making while watching the show unfold outside.  Staff was young and friendly.  The owners were also bouncing around putting up counter-protest signs talking about their commitment to sustainable food and opposition to speciesism (why horse and not other critters?) in the planters in front of the restaurant.  Naturally,  the complimentary  amuse bouche was a horsemeat tartar canape -  it was very nice, lean, tender, and a bit sweet. I had the prix fixe menu (about $30) for appetizer, main and dessert (about 4 choices for each).  Appetizer was a sunchoke soup.  It was lovely and creamy -  best thing I had eaten on a long, cold, drizzly day.  Topped with crunchy ground up hazelnuts (toasted? sauteed?) and fresh parsley.  Main was the duck confit.  What I Ioved about the food in this place - evident in all the dishes but especially in the duck - was the effort to provide a balance of contrasting flavours and textures in everything.  The duck was rich and tender, contrasted with slightly al dente lentils and maple roasted root vegetables. It was excellent.  Dessert was creme brulee - part of my hunt for the perfect brulee.  This one was mostly excellent.  Creamy, nice flavour and texture.  Perfectly caramelized topping.  The one criticism I have (and this may just be a personal quirk) is that the creme was fridge-cold in places not heated when the sugar gets torched. Do they teach this in culinary school?  Keep the brulee in  the the fridge until the last moment?  Imagine how much nicer the creme would be if it was a warmish, unjarring, uniform temperature all the way through.  Aside from my extremist views on the dessert, this was a wonderful meal.  Highly recommended.  In the end, the horse protest provided some interesting street theatre (horse head costumes and ketchup -- you figure it out), but was pretty feeble all in all. Staff was vigilant to make sure customers came and went unmolested."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favourite restaurant's in toronto. It feels like you've walked into your favourite neighbourhood bistro in paris, where the food is serious, people are warm, and the atmosphere bustling. The owner shamaz is always nearby to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves and the service is always very attentive. My favourite dish here is the steak and frites - amazing steak cooked to whatever perfection means to you and the most perfect french fries. The fried camembert is also stellar. This place has had a mayor following since it's early days in kensington market and It's easy to see why."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Had one of the best meals in a long while. I had the horsemeat tenderloin, which was cooked to perfection. Great side of asparagus with hollandaise. My companion had confit du canard. Great."}
{"text":"After a typical long Monday (hey everyone feels down after the first Monday when the Daylight Saving has ended!) I decided to try this place as they have the Delirium Tremens Beer on tap. I really wanted to try this beer and this place had decent reviews so I decided to give it a try. I went for the Prixe Fix menu which has 3 courses for 32$. I went the escargots, Steak and Creme Brulee'. Escargots were excellent. Nicely Balanced with crisp croutons and just right spinach. Steak was ok and I think the portion was tiny but the fries made the dish better. The Dessert was tiny made with real vanilla beans and topped with Pineapple bits (I think they were too chewy) The beer selection was great so I tried out a bottle in addition to my Delirium Tremens. The place is laid back and I had a nice chat with the couple next too me. We ended up sharing a drink together which is great as the place is not stuffy. 3.5 Stars IMO. Good bistro food if you are looking for one."}
{"text":"The chefs at La Palette craft each meal with great attention to detail. The Poisson was cooked to perfection and the flavor radiated ever so decadently from the dish. The waiters were friendly, provided great direction, and our water glasses were always full. I suggest finishing your meal with an americano with dessert. Both the mousse and the zesty lemon tart are good options.   The portions are small and the plates a bit expensive, but you're paying for the TLC that goes into both the food and service. It's obvious those at La Palette know about quality food service. It's definitely a dinner worth your $$."}
{"text":"I continue to return to La Palette because of the food, the atmosphere and the people. A few weeks ago, I really wanted to take my BF's mother to La Palette as I knew she would love the whole experience. Problem though... she is a vegetarian. With the restaurant having a dominantly meat loving  menu, I called ahead to see if there was anything they could do for us.   Although they only have 1 Vegetarian option on the menu, they were willing to offer up suggestions of items that they could make vegetarian. they were helpful and it made the dining experience amazing once again.  Friday night, I went back yet again... To my surprise, they are now serving Thirty Bench wine on the menu.. Bravo La Palette. You have made this Torontonian VERY happy."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm disappointed in myself. How can I call my self a Yelper formally known as Elite and not have written a review on my absolute favourite place in this city. I mean I wrote about it when it was in Kensington but haven't bothered to put ink to paper (or keys to computer) and write about the new-ish location.  I have been going to La Palette since it's Kensington Market Glory Days as I mentioned above and I had severe apprehensions when I saw they were moving to Queen Street West. I mean, half the elegance of La Palette was the quaint and coziness of their Kensington location. But alas, I bit the bullet and went and I have to say, I'm still thoroughly impressed.  Because most recently I went there for Valentine's day, let me discuss the greatness of their menu on this day. They do two sittings and 7 courses. The found this year was outstanding. I had lobster, Steak Frites, salad, Crème brûlée, A Camabert dish and then two amuse bouch. Delish. The thing I also love about here is that you can get a liter of wine that won't break the bank and is still quite drinkable.  On none special nights, I still love to come for the prix fixe and I always tend to try something different. It's so incredible how the kitchen has NEVER made a bad dish. There has never been a meh meal and I have always left wanting more (for the taste, not the portion!)  If nothing else, go there for some french wine and soak in a little bit of paris. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was one of my odd experiences at a restaurant. My visit was for Mother's day, so it was a few months ago, but it was somewhat strange that the experience stayed with me. Overall, the restaurant is really adorable. Love the cozy decor, the liveliness of the cooks working hard and the plating. I think it would be great date night kind of a place. The food was good and enjoyable, but not particularly mind blowing. Would recommend for the vibe.  The strange part of the night was how the server was rushing us to finish. The server was oddly over enthusiastic about clearing our tables even when it was very obvious that we were still working on things. I know that the restaurant changes into a lounge kind of a thing on weekend nights, so I especially booked the reservation a little earlier, keeping this in mind. I'm not sure if the servers felt like they were under a time pressure (the restaurant wasn't even full when we got there though) or perhaps they needed to seem busy since the manager was there, but by the time i got my dessert, I had given up telling the server that I'm still working on my plate (for each course) and just let him take my plate away with my spoon mid-air, with still some bites left. Perhaps, some folks would label this as great service, but it was disappointing that I couldn't fully enjoy my food. Felt like I had to protect my food from having it grabbed away."}
{"text":"A great taste of France located in Toronto's downtown.  I've heard only good things about this place and decided to take the gf here for a surprise birthday dinner!    The staff and chiefs were very attentive and the food came out sizzling hot and warm to the touch.  I ordered the duck confit, along with the steamed mussles and a nice house dessert to end things off.  Overall a very romantic vibe and great for a date.  The food was top notch and you'd better be sure it will go down in the DM after you take that special someone here for the night!"}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly attentive service. Well thought out menu, featuring local, seasonal items. Fiddle heads, asparagus & lentils as a base for duck breast... yum!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for La Palette. I had been before when they were in their Kensington Location and I remember liking it a lot. We went last night for my boyfriend's birthday, and we were a little disappointed. We had a nice time, but on the way home we both mused that we wouldn't be able to give them 4 stars as there were highs and lows.  Since it was his birthday, we were sparing no expense and looking to have a fabulous meal. They get points for having a great menu and a lot of wonderful daily specials that feature game meat, which we both love. The girl who sat us explained these in detail.  In order to better decide, we asked our server to recommend a few things. We asked him about the Frog's Legs and he replied that he had not tried them because of a gluten allergy. Well, ok, but are they regarded as being good? What is the feedback from other diners? Could you ask another server? The service wasn't bad, it was quite good, but I'm always stumped at why servers think that diners need to hear about allergies or eating habits. Even if you're a vegetarian, it's your job to sell the food on the menu, so you should be able to describe the steak.  We had a glass of Pinot Noir to begin and then ordered a glass of Muscat with our foie gras, as per he suggestion on the menu. However, they were out of Muscat and the bartender suggested a Sweet Hungarian Wine, that she would give us for the same price?? I'm thinking that a sweet Hungarian wine that isn't even on your wine list, should be LESS or even free in place of not having the advertised pairing,   The foie gras helping was of a decent size, but we both felt that it was under seasoned and the texture was not that great. I don't think I've ever had that complaint about foie gras before. Frog's Legs were good -- like less meaty chicken wings with a nice flavour. The escargot were nothing special and we found them to be more of a garnish on a salad, which was underwhelming.   i wouldn't recommend the Prix Fixe as the portions seemed to be much smaller than those on the A La Carte menu.  I had the quack and track and the Horse Tenderloin was exceptionally tender and flavourful. The barley risotto was nice, and the duck confit, while flavourful, lacked the nice crispy duck skin that I enjoyed the last time I was at La Palette.  The Wild Boar Rib that my boyfriend had was nice and smoky and came with a warm cabbage slaw that was really good, but only the half of the rib that was still on the bone was tender. The rest was a bit dry.  The lemon tart was delicious and I had three cheeses that were very nice.  Our bill came to $230 and I couldn't help but feel that we could have had a better dinner elsewhere for  far less. I might go back for the atmosphere and to have a few nibbles off the appetizer menu and a glass of wine, but we were not very impressed with La Palette. I wish we'd gone to Le Paradis, where almost everything is half the price and twice as delicious."}
{"text":"Expensive, but really nice. I would recommend the salmon."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal and service The service really stood out. Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and wine list and based on choices gave a great wine recommendation.   I had the salad, followed duck breast on cabbage and beats . Absolutely wonderful combination of flavors."}
{"text":"Good food  The fondant and calamari were delicious. Bread and oil was very tasty. fiancé had the escargot and duck leg. I had the risotto with duck leg. Both were good though the king oyester mushrooms were myeast favorite part. For dessert we had the sorbet (awful) ice cream,  flourless torte which was delish and the tiny creme bulee  Service was good and attentive   Points lost for freezing cold corner for seating and small dessert portions."}
{"text":"Had one of my best meals in Toronto so far...and it revolved around the horse tenderloin  We started with the foie gras, which was perfectly seared, silky, rich and flavorful.   I had the horse tenderloin, which I've been dying to try since I read about it. I didn't know what to expect...but i'll say this- it's better than any filet mignon i've ever had.  Juicy, tender, buttery and so flavorful.  I savored every single bite of it.  The risotto that accompanied it was delicious...but the tenderloin was definitely the star. It was quite a hefty piece of meat too; they definitely were not cheap with it.   The ambience is great; cozy, unpretentious and just like a French bistro. We had a great wine that went with our meal...french...can't remember the grape...something i've never heard of (fer...?)  My carnivore friend had the bison which was good, but not as amazing as my horse. He enjoyed his meal too  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Since I heard this place is one of the best french place in town, i decided to give it a try.  Environment /Service --Restaurant looks amazing from the outside. However, inside decroation is kind of disappointing. It is very old country style like you are eating at your grandma's old house. The table cloth colour theme and the chair made the resturant looks very cheap and sketchy. You would not expect the menu is this expensive when you look inside the restaurant. I think that's why most people walk by and look at the menu and then just walk away. -Service is nice. Waitress does know their food and menu and provide some valuable suggestion  Food: --mussules (3/5) .  The sauce of the day is coconut curry.It is a very unique sauce and i do think it's worthy of trying. However, the mussuls and sauce was not hot enough. The dish was warm, which made it less enjoyable. If it were hot enough, i believe you could smell and taste the sauce better.   --Escargot (2/5).  Escargot is very different than other french restaurant. It was not baked. It is more like fried escargot with mushroom. Again, the dish was warm and didnt look like freshly cooked at all. I was very upset about this dish since i LOVE escargot  --Grilled horse meat and venison (4/5) The meat were cooked perfectly. When waitress informed me they cooked them rare, I were a little bit worried. However, it turned out to be perfect. You can feel that the meat is melting into your mouse. If you want to try something different, definitely order this dish. I have nothing to complain about it.   --duck neck sausage (3.5/5) The meat and testure were great. Howeve, I don't like the puree because  It was sweet. It was a light dish and suitable for summer. I just disliked the sweet flavour in the dish in general.  We didnt order any alcohol and the bills is around $120.  The price is okay in terms of the french food. However, i dont think i would go back again if i get to choose the resturant."}
{"text":"What an amazing brunch! I tried the eggs Benedict with wild boar, it was perfect. Wife went with the croissant with halibut, she says she could eat another one so good it was. They also have the amazing Dieu du Ciel! beer, only those are worth the visit. A gem in Toronto fashion district."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience last night, lovely atmosphere, food and staff! The bone marrow escargot was our absolute favourite and cheeses were out of this world. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"for a Humpday night treat with a three year old it was a pleasant place to eat.. if you are a Bison fan, which mean you eat meat, this place has some great treats.. we all ordered from the Prix Fixe menu i had, Joues de Bison - Slow-braised, bacon-crusted bison cheeks w/ maple braising jus, heirloom tomato salad & corn fritters, this went well with the bison barley soup with big chunks of beefy barley in a well rendered stock that had  the sweetness of a rich red wine. my wifey partial to quail eggs had Perche Jaune - Potato-crusted Lake Huron yellow perch filet with haricots verts, heirloom tomatos, nicoice olives, capers, soft-boiled quail egg and an anchovy-dijon vinaigrette, her appitizer of pate was a little too smooth as she prefers a firmer pate, however with the bread and extra crisps that were supplied i made a meal of it.  their desserts were wonderfully classic, creme brulee with the custard still warm, and the sugar caramalized and crispy, my chocolate flouorless cake with vanilla icecream and pralines was eaten by my three year old. and he loved it..   for my 3 year old we ordered him a chicken breast a la carte and they charged us $20 for it was basically, Poulet Bonne Maman - Juicy free-range & organic chicken breast w/ roast fingerlings, vegetables, zesty onion-red peppercorn compôte & black currant-raspberry jus ,without the roast fingerlings, vegetables, zesty onion-red peppercorn compôte & black currant-raspberry jus.  we should have asked the price first.  the new waitress was pleasant, and there were only two people staffing the restaurant. it seemed like there were a lot of repeat clients there that night, as it has a lovely street front patio in front of a car filled with dirt and plants.  over all a charming bohemian experience complete with absinthe.  other than the $20 chicken breast it was a great hump day restaurant"}
{"text":"If you want to drink really good wines at reasonable prices then this is one of the places to come. The owner is extremely knowledgeable, willing to discuss your tastes and allow you to try some alternatives before choosing a bottle. He has a comprehensive and eclectic collection that for the most part cannot be found elsewhere.  On top of that the food is also good! We started with a pâté which was a large piece of coarse pâté and fairly standard, the bread that came with it was a disappointment. The salad we chose was also fine but nothing to write home about. We had the chicken which came as two pieces, one crispy and tasty the other was also good with mushrooms although the mushrooms were cold. Our steak was perfectly done, quite big enough to share between two and accompanied by very good fries.  We drank two excellent Burgundies well priced."}
{"text":"The FAMED La Palette! It was okay. It's supposed to be one of the best in Toronto.  If I had not tried a lot of other French places in Toronto I would have given it a 4 star.  To tell you the truth: IT's good.  But it's not THAT good. You know what IS 'THAT' good?  Le Select Bistro http://www.yelp.ca/biz/le-s%C3%A9lect-bistro-toronto-3#hrid:hzm9zEzwmr44QfIR-k3JHA  The food is good- not going to be counter to any other review on here.   However I'm not too crazy about the setup of this restaurant.  I always loved the way this looked from the outside but on the inside I felt the general restaurant a little.... grotty or like I'm sitting on my grandma's really old-never-cleaned upholstered armchair.  It's not like my grandma is dirty..it's just that it's not the \"freshest\" restaurant.  I much prefer Le Select, it's classic without being musty. Oh, and the food at Le Select is a star above."}
{"text":"Unique options for dinner. Had duck dish and their service is great. Prices on the higher side."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here. The food, wine and service were excellent, and the place is comfy. Four of us shared starters: Foie gras, oysters, escargot and fromage fondant. The foie gras was the standout. For main plates, we chose the moules frites, the duck confit and the  Quack n Track, which is filet of horse and duck confit. Hard to choose a favorite as all three were delicious. We shared a yummy tarte au citron for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here to try the duck confit and it did not disappoint! The duck was not overly salty like most places, and had a nice char on the skin. The duck leg was on a bed of wild rice which sat in some broth. The wild rice was also cooked really well, a balance between retaining a bit of the chewy texture but so much that it would be hard on the stomach. The only thing I didn't quite like in the dish was the pesto like herb sauce. It was on the sour side which masked the flavours of the herbs/greens.  I also had the escargot for appetizer. The garlic oil  went really well with the complimentary bread."}
{"text":"I am always looks for restaurants that are walking distance with character. I found this gem on Yelp while looking for a french bistro. They have a great price fix for steak + an app + dessert. The front bar area would be a great place to people watch and grab a drink in the summer. And, the dining area bustles like an authentic Parisian restaurant. The escargot app with bone marrow was delicious. And, the mussels came with a generous portion. Both our steaks were done to our liking. Though, there was nothing particularly stand out about the meal here, the ambiance is what would take me back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are always in search of good French restaurants. Specially the ones that may open till late so that we may go there after theaters, and movies. This is a really impossible desire in Toronto. We are so fortunate to discover La Palette. Just to add the context, we have previously been to Scaramouche, Didier, Tati, Bistro 990, Loire, and some others. We travel to these establishments from Mississauga. When I called La Palette, to seek a table for 2 at 10 PM. The call was eagerly and most amicably attended, and I was told that we can certainly come at 10. It seems that La Palette is happy to receive customers till late. Upon arrival the reception was amicable and warm. One minor discomfort was that we were offered seats near the coat room, in an area which is very chilly due to some kind of persistent draft from some door.  Had to change tables twice, and were lucky that at that  time the restaurant did have some available. Everything after that was outstanding.  The server gave us the specials menu, and we did not find it as impressive as their main menu. We ordered Escargo La Palette, and Riz de Veau to share as appetizers. Pre appetizer bread and olive oil was delicious, we enjoyed the toasted crust very much. For the main my wife chose the Norwegian Macakarel, and I chose the Duck n Buck. Every single one of the above orders was fantastic.  For the desert, despite being too full, we ordered the Cloufati which was very light and  great  to end our meal. Even the Cafe Americano was quite perfect. Service was very friendly and non intrusive. I would say that we will place La Palette just after Scaramouche and Bistro 990 and equal or very close to Loire. It is only because the first two are in a different class due to their locations and market segment.  One thing is certain: We will go to La Palette again and again till they get fed up with us."}
{"text":"La Palette is not as it used to be. My sister snd I decided to treat our relatives in HK out for dinner - French food - not something different.  Although I enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant with the open kitchen taking centre stage, I can't help but raise an eyebrow to their tacky tablecloths and chairs.    The servers are all relatively young. The nice thing is that La Palette is not too hard on your wallet with its Prix Fixe menu ringing in at $33.  All items on the menu marked with a star are available on the PF menu.  We ordered the Escargot, Roasted Red Pepper Soup and Pàté de Compagne to start. The escargot was not prepared in it's traditional drenched in butter fashion and was served atop a bed of spinach topped with croutons. It was disappointing and rather bland. The pâté was quite yummy though it came with no crackers or even a slice of bread until we asked for our bread basket to be replenished.   For mains we ordered duck confit, soufflé and steak frites. The duck confit was rather tender and flavourful though the skin was lacking crispness. It was served atop a bed of a corn & peas spaëtzle mixture.    The soufflé was a ricotta soufflé served with ratatouille and a side salad. The soufflé was creamy but the outer layer wS too sponge-y for me. The ratatouille was rather flavorless and the side salad was nothing special.   The steak was rather disappointing as it was 1) cold 2) tough and 3) a tiny piece of steak. I will vouch though that it was seared to a perfect medium rare and I will also vouch for their yummy yummy frites!  One of the best frites I've had!  Desserts consisted of crême brûlée, clafouti, flourless almond and chocolate cake, and a lemon tart.  The crême brûlée was so small the spoon barely fit. The lemon tart was too sour. The flourless cake was dry as a dessert and the clafouti was meh.   All in all, the place was a miss for me. If you're looking for good French food. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here on a not busy Thursday evening.  Ordered the pate and escargots to start - fine, but nothing to write home about.  Duck confit and steak frites for our mains.  Duck confit sat on a bed of tepid vegetables, and was extremely fatty in places, and very dry.  My dining partner's steak was also mediocre.    Service was stilted and awkward - get some servers with personality.   We ordered the prix fixe - but dessert was taking too long to come and we had movie plans, so we had to get it to go.   Over $100 for a very sub-par dining experience.  As much as chain restaurants get a bad rap, when we walked by Milestone's later that evening - we both wished we had eaten there."}
{"text":"Oh wow, yum.   We came for a Valentine's date last night. I had asked AT to book it weeks in advance, they called at least twice to confirm. I guess it was that much in demand.   It was a set menu priced at $60 per person. Wine was extra.  The atmosphere in here is definitely Bohemian. It's not the posh bistro that you would find on champ elysses, nor does the food in the menu reflect that.   Tons of appetizers to choose from - escargot, salad, lobster bisque, pan sear foie gras for an extra $10. I got the roasted sweetbread that came with a bunch of side fixings. It was the best part of the meal.  AT got the doie liver pate. Good, but not as worth the money as my sweetbread.   For the entree, he ordered the Wild Boar that came with some sweet potato veggie concoction. It tasted a lot like chicken breast. We confirmed it with her, but I guess that's how boar tastes. Not flavourful except for the outside. (I don't like chicken's breasts...)  My bison rib eye was delicious. Cooked medium rare, thinly, with the burnt edges that  I like. It was gamey and flavourful and came with fries and a dip made out of bone marrow and something else. Delicious.   For dessert, they had creme brulee (vanilla, darjeeling, and absinthe). Absinthe!? I had to get it. It tasted like a regular creme brulee, but with a definite kick. I was also mighty happy after this. AT got the Clafouti, and he loved it. It was a basically a custard baked pie.  The service was great, and after about 2 hours, they gracefully kicked us out by giving us the bill. And everyone got homemade chocolate truffles to take home. Yum.   Would come back especially for a special occasion. It's dim in here, and super romantic (not sure why romantic = dim)"}
{"text":"The bone marrow butter is life changing.   Came here and all four of us did the prix fixed menu and it did not disappoint. The restaurant was decorated with antiques and the atmosphere was quaint. For appetizers we tried the soup du jour (don't recall what it was), salad verte, and pate grand mere. The soup was delicious as was the salad. The late was good but a bit much for an appetizer and not enough crostinis were served with it. For the mains we got the steak/frites, pocket,  duck confit, and le vegeterien. All the mains were good, but the best was the steak/frites. That bone marrow butter was amazing. It added great flavour to the steak what was seared perfectly, crisp skin and medium rare inside. I'd eat more than one serving of the steak/frites. For dessert we got, the brownie (no longer on the menu), gateau at chocolat, tarte au citron, and an apple dessert (no longer in the menu). Of the desserts our favourite was the apple dessert. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend and his parents here for brunch because it seemed like the most decent option available for New Year's Day. (most everything was closed) I was excited about the menu when I looked online, from escargot to tartare to eggs benedict. We ordered the snails and it was...okay? I mean it wasn't excellent but it wasn't bad, I would say mediocre. I have had better because the flavors just didnt' stand out for me. My eggs benedict was burnt and the egg wasn't very poached. My biggest complaint about this place was the service. There were 2 waitresses, it was clearly not busy.  I had to flag the waitress multiple times before I gave up and physically went straight to her (TWICE)to ask for more water and the bill. When I went to the waitress to ask for the bill, she irritably explained to me that she was coming to our table. I didn't appreciate her tone and excuse and I didn't appreciate that she was not attentive to our table at all when it was seriously not busy.  Horrible experience, and mediocre to below average food. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"I feel like I am giving a good amount of 5 star reviews lately, however, I have been so impressed with the food in Toronto and this place is A MUST.  It was one of the better experiences I have had in a long time. Sure, I had great company with me, but in addition, the ambiance and the cuisine was fantastic.  We started with the escargot. I can't say I loved the way it was served, meaning, the escargot was still inside the shell and you simply had to pull it out. Regardless, the taste and garlic butter sauce was perfect.  So here is the thing. I spent time in Buenos Aires, Argentina where you would never put a sauce on a steak so I understand if some people don't believe this is the way a steak should be served. That being said, the steak I had at \"La Palette\" with its sweet  (not to sweet) and perfectly detailed sauce, was one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life.  I have joked with my friend that I will fly back to Toronto, just for that steak.   I LOVED this place!"}
{"text":"Stop 2 of AlzCon 2k16.  This place just gets me, which is evident as soon as you start walking down the center of the restaurant to locate the main seating area, only to be greeted by an open kitchen to your right where everything from frying pans to ancient washing boards to the giant vents are decorations, and a self-titled Wall of Booze to your left that apparently boasts over 150 different types of alcohol to drown your sad adult sorrows in. But I couldn't tell you about that.  (There are flies, but I like to think they make the restaurant look alive.) If you look up, the ceiling is metal, with several lights hanging down - the seating area, to contrast, has a skylight. The tables are covered in colorful cloths, and you'll spot two or three chairs that don't match the red of the others, and that's perfectly fine. The walls are covered in paintings and drawings and other cool things - generally, this place is just very old-timey, and it instantly grabs you with its charm. As for food: Fromage Fondant, Foie Gras, Carrot Cake. It all shares a general theme of exuding this earthly, smoky feel to it, which I find hard to describe - in general, strong flavors that remind you of meat grilled over a charcoal fire (but without actually being meat grilled over a charcoal fire). Nuts, like pecans, are common. Sour and sweet where it doesn't feel necessary also is. It's a nice variety, and each dish tastes and looks distinctly different, but they all feel like they belong together.  Man, what a nice atmosphere.  I love it.  4/5"}
{"text":"Je reviendrai jamais! La Palette is a disgrace to French service and cuisine. We were rushed through our dining experience in 25 minutes flat (not very French at all). Service was clueless; floor staff had zero sense of timing and no understanding of how to create an experience for diners. Starters were delivered before drinks, starter course was cleared before we finished, dinner was served in record time, while we sat with empty wine glasses. Plates were cleared late, we were not offered further refreshments. Food was bland, greasy and not even remotely skillfully prepared. During the table check (which was performed far too late) when I informed the waiter that the meal was underwhelming, he literally shrugged and walked away. For French dining of the highest calibre, go to Le Select Bistro instead, only a short walk away."}
{"text":"I had a friend with me this time when I made a visit to Canada to see my friend . He threw down the gauntlet and said he wanted something \"exotic\". Well thanks to fellow yelpers, you can't get more exotic than eating horse, bison, and caribou.  We made reservations for 7:30 and arrived with plenty of tables to spare and a wet paint sign that caused the door to stick and the molding of it to tear off. The server recognized us from our phone call and sat us at 2 round tables put side by side.  The two servers that were on duty tonight were hopping from table to table and in a place this small I suppose it isn't a thing of 1 server being the only one you deal with. One of them got us wine, the other gave us the specials, then the guy who brought the wine took our order, and the guy who gave the specials brought the bread and soups, etcetcetc.   My friend was really in the mood for their mussel dish, however upon arriving and looking for it on the menu, it was nowhere to be found. One of the servers informed us they were out of season for them and they just hadn't updated the web page. She settled on the fried cheese appetizer and the soup of the day. My friend for a meat combo dish of Horse and Caribou. And for me there was a special they were running called the \"Quack & Track\" Horse and Duck.  Everything that came out was fantastic and cooked just about perfectly. The horse I was not expecting to have a fish undertone to it, but I suppose, what do you expect when you are about to eat Mr.Ed? Candy?? The caribou did taste more gamy but with the herbs they use, still excellent. My duck was moist, tender and full of flavor, I only wish there was more of it. My friend really enjoyed her two orders as well and everyone cleared their entire plates.   A fantastic date place, or a spot you want to impress a client or two."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a nightcap with a couple of friends. Beautiful mellow atmosphere. Had some great Quebecois gin and a few rounds of this vanilla tequila that blew everyone away. Didn't make it for dinner this go, but will definitely be back on my next trip to Toronto. Best service we had all week, and that's saying something. Toronto has some stupendous service workers."}
{"text":"This was a great bistro experience! Meats were perfectly cooked, venison tartar was well seasoned. Veggies were perfect. And atmosphere was lively. The seating was a little tight.- a drunk group on the corner in combination with being so close to other tables just made it hard to have  a private conversation. The service felt rushed- pleasant enough but our server  kept trying to clear our table and  fill our wine glasses too  often- she could have slowed it down a bit. Very sold with a menu that had several daily specials so you could return often and never get bored with it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto. If you're a fan of Parisian/French food, you need to try La Palette! Start with oysters, fromage fondant and charcuterie. Their mussels and fois gras are always incredible. Their tartare is the best I've ever had! They have an eclectic selection of spirits and a GIANT wine by the glass menu. They've been operational for 18 years and are open 7 days a week. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The staff are friendly and the service is outstanding! They go above and beyond - always! It's a very comfortable place to dine solo, on a date or with a large group! I recommend making a  reservation (2+ people)  because they are always busy! I hope they stay open for another 20 years. I almost forgot - The Creme Brulee is a must have. They have 3 flavors daily, but I highly recommend trying the trio! Happy times all around at La Palette!"}
{"text":"my bf and i came here a while back but i recall the service staff to be very friendly and kind as well the drinks were excellent.  e tremely professional and love the atnosphere  would love to have dinner here sometime."}
{"text":"Looking for an authentic French restaurant with a cool and casual vibe. Love the duck confit and the frogs legs were awesome. Plus my 4 friends really enjoyed their steak frites. Their meals were so big that they left some of each behind. All the desserts were also yummy. And a prix fixe 3 course dinner was only $35. Two dinners and a brunch over the course of the year - all excellent with great service each time. Definitely on the list for more meals in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely classically deliciously French.  La Palette, despite moving a few years back, is a fixture. French comfort food at cozy tables well prepared and served by friendly, knowledgeable staff. It's like eating at your friend's place, if your friend is a French chef. It puts you at ease. Fat, happy ease.  Things not to miss: their mussels are great, as is their charcuterie (much of it cured in house). They have tame mains, but I would find whatever exciting meat they're making and steer directly towards it. I've had my first musk ox at la palette and, years ago, when I was a youngster, maybe even my first wild boar. Their bison steak is lovely, as is their venison. Their tartars are a personal favourite.  Their wine list is hand written, changed regularly, delicious and affordable. Because you're really just over at your friend's place, of course you can taste any wine before ordering, and of course everything's available by the glass. Their beers are local and well chosen, too.   You will eat and drink well here. You should come today. You should save room for the crème brûlée trio, whose flavours change regularly, but are always exquisite.  Pro tip (pay attention here, because this tip is important): eat the horse. Either on its own as a 6oz tenderloin, or as part of their sometimes-on-the-menu, sometimes-secret \"quack and track\" combination horse and duck confit plate. Served with oat risotto at the moment, it is a tender and savoury cut, without being at all gamy or gross. Get over the taboo, and give it a try. It won't disappoint. Have I steered you wrong before?"}
{"text":"Cozy hole in the wall my friends and I stumbled across while walking down Queen street in Toronto.  Our mission was to find an authentic French restaurant (or close).  We had an expert in the group who had lived in France for several years, and she was pleased. It's a small place with only a few tables, has a bar and cooks are in the open cooking amongst the guests so the place smells amazing and makes your mouth water. I tried the chicken sausage with bread pudding and brussel sprouts...amazing!! My friends had the duck with homemade pasta.  I preferred my chicken.  The duck dish was lacking something...and didn't \"wow\" me. They are known mainly for their horse meat which I didn't try. Ambiance was nice...very mellow and service was excellent. Loves the hand written wine list and dinner specials."}
{"text":"Had to go back!  My wife wouldn't let me have \"Quack and Track\" again.  Too bad I really enjoyed it, but one has to move on.  Great neighborhood bistro."}
{"text":"Terrible.  The arrogant and over opinionated bar staff were more keen on sharing personal cultural and political views than they were customer service.  Although we enjoyed the wine served and the atmosphere of the venue, we felt uncomfortable and unwelcome due to the openly shared views of the bar staff.  It is inappropriate for barstaff to share personal political opinions particularly when those opinions can be considered insulting to their diverse clientele, or any member of the general public.  I have no intention of recommending this venue."}
{"text":"Sadly, the waitress brought me the wrong dinner, I ordered a medium rare steak and she brought me a well done steak.  I didn't want to eat alone, so I tried to eat it, as I watched my friend at the end of the table eat my medium rare steak, he seemed to like it anyways."}
{"text":"Update:  Went to La Palette for brunch and fell in love with the Challah bread french toast topped with fruit.  Decadent and delicous!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for the dinner and looked at the menu before going so I knew in advance that I want the fois gras for entree. It never fails. I ordered the quack and track (duck and horse) for main course - very interesting. He horse tasted like steak. Over all, loved it. The service was wonderful - very friendly. The price is fair, a little on the higher side but worthy for the great adventure. Decor gives me a very warn and cozy feeling. Seems like the only thing missing was a nice warm fireplace."}
{"text":"This was an impulsive choice but so yummy. The missing star was only due to a glitch causes by a temporary lack of debit/credit beyond their control but they should have told us when we came. How ever a quick run up the street solved that. The food was amazing the escargot and bone marrow dish was great. Loved the horse tartar and found that portion huge. Significantly accessible wine list and fabulous cocktails.  For a main we did the duck confit and subbed in some vegetables for the standard side. Great creme brulee as well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a Friday night date night and went to La Palette for a wonderful dinner.  La Palette serves high quality French cuisine and provides a great atmosphere to eat.  The restaurant is not too large and they decorate it with drapes and curtains at the entrance and use dim lighting to create a cozy, romantic ambiance.  La Palette offered a prix fixe combo with an appetizer, a main and a dessert so after debating on various adventurous options (many reviews kindly point out they serve horse meat and other interesting items) on their menu, we decided to go with the combo to try more varieties.  My love she ordered the 'Moules du jour' (mussels), chicken main course and creme brule.  I ordered escargot (snails), duck main course and chocolate mousse.  After a short wait, our appetizers came, along with some bread on the house.  I liked the escargot but found it slightly slimy (yeah snails are slimy).  I really like the mussels (moules du jour) they were delicious and the sauce was excellent.  The duck main dish was was also very good.  I got a nice large piece and it came in a thick, savoury sauce.  I also tried some chicken and it was also tasty.    Finally.  The desserts came and they were both amazing.  I liked the creme brule a little bit more but both the creme brule and chocolate mousse were excellent.  Overall.  Excellent food, great atmosphere and very good service.  La Palette is a high end restaurant that delivers on quality.  4.7 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Horse tenderloin is very unique and the fries are delicious. The duck leg looks pretty good, I will definitely have a try next time."}
{"text":"I had brunch here on a sunday.  I started with the fried camembert, which was great.  The exterior was crunchy, the inside ranged from liquid to gooey.  The berry coulis was neither too sweet nor too sour, and complemented the camembert very nicely.  Despite the fat content, overall it didn't feel too \"heavy.\"  Next I had a boar crepinette, which was a little dry, but only slightly so.  It came with a fried egg, and when I ate them together it was just fine.  The green beans on the side were nice and crisp.  The duck confit omlette was satisfactory, but nothing special.  The duck was mostly lost in the omlette, neither the texture nor the flavor were sufficiently prominent.  For dessert, I had the trio of creme brulees.   The vanilla was a well-executed classic, with a rich full-bodied flavor. I was quite happy with the lime (I'm generally a fan of lime) which had sweet and sour flavors well balanced. The chocolate-chili (which they warned me was still in an experimental stage) was okay, but I had to use my imagination a bit to taste the chili.  The service was prompt, accurate, and friendly.  While some of the food was not awesome, I decided to award 4 stars on the strength of the fried camembert and the creme brulees, and also on account of the great service."}
{"text":"So I popped my French cuisine cherry and what better way than to eat at La Palette.  I expected a very fancy, uptight place but once I walked in it felt very comfortable and casual, just the way I like things.  We ordered: Mussels with lardon - the broth was buttery and delicious! Trio of meats: Boar, Horse, Venison -melt in your mouth meats accompanied by risotto oh baby! Foie Gras - like solidified butter amazing Horse Tartare - fantastic and smooth i would get this again Homemadei Ice Cream - SOOOOO GOOOOD  Even the espresso I ordered after my meal was one of the best I have ever had and I have had the best made by Nonna :)  This is a must go if you haven't been or haven't tried French cuisine like me.  The flavours were rich and creamy but not overly powering.  I see why my sister tells me French cuisine is her favourite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with dinner at La Palette for our anniversary. Though I'd walked by the restaurant many times, I'd never been there before. I could see where he was going with his choice - the décor is quaint, the atmosphere is cozy, romantic, and not pretentious. Unfortunately, we didn't luck out with a table on the patio, which was completely packed, but the dining area was fairly empty when we arrived and we got a table near the front. An hour later, the whole place was packed (including a party of ten who were taking up literally one third of the small restaurant). Tight seating doesn't usually bother me, but the volume level was so high, we practically had to shout across the table to hear each other. I guess those are the perils of Friday night at a popular dinner place.  Though the evening started out with extremely attentive service, by the time La Palette was at capacity, the three servers on duty could barely keep their heads above water. I've waited tables, and I can sympathize, but waiting 20 minutes for a server to take your credit card is annoying (to be perfectly blunt).  Anyway, on to the food. We started with a plate of charcuterie which had delicious smoked meats, pate, and foie gras. My boyfriend played it safe with steak frites (with delightful, crispy, thin fries) for his main, but I decided to get experimental and I ordered the horse steak. I can honestly say I've never eaten such tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat. It's incredibly lean, too. We were both wowed by the horse.  We ordered the crème brulee sampler for dessert. The texture seemed a bit runny (though this is a French restaurant, so perhaps this is more authentic than the standard crème brulee?) and I tend to prefer firmer, more custard-like crème brulee - though it's difficult to really go wrong with this creamy, sugary goodness. The amaretto flavored one was good, though the standard vanilla one was the best. The third crème brulee was flavored with some liqueur that I can't remember, but I found it bitter and only had one bite.  Overall, this is a great date spot, dinner was delicious, and I'd love to come back (perhaps on a weekday evening)."}
{"text":"We ordered croissant nicoise, crepe lamb, clafoutis, and peach sorbet. They are all delicious. The croissant is rich with Brie cheese and grilled vegetables and the desserts are sweet at the right amount. The patio is great too."}
{"text":"We did not anticipate to make a visit to La Palette but I am sure glad we did.  This awesome French restaurant is all that we needed for a nice place to hang out and grab some drinks with our out of town guests. It was perfect and such a cute place. Super laid back and comfortable atmosphere. We were there for some munchies, drinks and desserts. I had one of their daily creme brulee flavours (earl grey and sea salt caramel)- I opted for the earl grey creme brulee and it was yummy and just the right size. For $4, it was a mini size but it was just right to satisfy my late night sweet tooth!  My friends and ordered drinks and they definitely had a wide selection of cocktails, beers and wines. They really enjoyed this interesting flaming cocktail (I think it is the Sazerac)- it was prepared/mixed at the table by the waiter and he would light up the cup before pouring in the mixed drink. It was fun to watch the preparation and the drink was good as per my friends and husband. My husband also enjoyed the Dark and Stormy and my friend also liked his Negroni. My other friend had a few rounds of this Australian beer so I am sure it was good..unfortunately I don't have the name of it! Along with the drink, we ordered a few sides of fries- they looked quite good but I was too full from dinner. Service was excellent and loved how welcoming and quick it was. They have a open kitchen set up which is nice to see all the action.  We also found out the restaurant reopened after renovating and I am so glad it did- what a nice surprise to stumble in such a cute restaurant. I am loving this cozy, romantic restaurant and cannot wait to come back for some brunch!"}
{"text":"This place's atmosphere is really great for a fancy, cozy and intimate meal. Their wine selection is really special, and they have all their wine's by the glass, which is super nice. The duck was good and we decided to go with the horse...it was really nicely done - the outer layer was crispy and so well seasoned. Overall, a really special place when you're willing to pay for upscale french cuisine."}
{"text":"Food - 5 Service - 5 Atmosphere - 5 Price - 4  I'm greedy! There, I said it. I always want more that I can handle but I straight up devour everything that is on my plate. That being said, I would have liked a little more food for the price so they get 4 stars instead of 5. The service here is second to none. I had the duck and it was amazing.   My GF had: Poulet - Pan roasted chicken breast supreme, fried thigh, savory sweet potato bread pudding, strawberry-sage brown butter and rapini. For someone who doesn't like to try anything without knowing what it is, she devoured the bread pudding without hesitation and questioning what she was eating. In addition; she usually only eats chicken breasts but this time around she ate the thigh too. Words such as moist, flavorful and utterly delicious were muttered throughout the entire course. For dessert she had the flourless chocolate cake, it was rich, moist, and great ending to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Having walked by this place numerous times I was excited to try it out!  The restaurant has a old French vibe, like sitting in the old country in grandma's home..lol  The food is good but not superb.  I had the mussels and the 6oz steak, along with the beef and horse tartare.   I will say they have a price-fix menu for $36 (app/main/dessert) and there are lots of choices for this option- I would definitely recommend this option- the steak is one of them!  The mussels came in a nice broth, perhaps a bit flat but overall good.  I enjoyed my medium rare steak - it was done to perfect and the frites were nice, thin, and crisp!  I've tried beef tartare before but never horse.  The horse one had a leaner taste than the beef.  I'm glad I tried it but don't think I'd try it again.  Just not my thing   Dessert I chose the creme brûlée and it was your standard fare.  Since it was my birthday dinner they brought it out with a candle and a balloon!    Service here is great - friendly and they provide recommendations if wanted."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Everything on the menu was delicious but beef tartare definitely was my favourite. They also have horse tartare if you're feeling adventurous:) Steaks were great too.  They have a pretty good wine and liquor selection as well, and you can sit at the bar,if you just popped in for a drink.  My only complaint would be that some tables are uncomfortably close to each other, so it makes it less intimate. However I understand that they were trying to do what they could as the place is pretty small."}
{"text":"A wonderful nook for a romantic date. Great house wines and beers on tap. Mussels were so amazing I finished the broth with a spoon. Chicken was crispy on the outside but melted in your mouth. Delicious savory bread pudding. Charcuterie was a variety of deliciousness. Chocolate cake was a perfect finish, not too rich."}
{"text":"knowing that i've been wanting to try la palette for the longest time, my bf took me here for our anniversary . now that i have been, i have mixed feelings towards it . i went in, wanting to fall in love with it so maybe i went with too much of a high expectation .   i absolutely loved the atmosphere . with the cozy decor & the dimmed lights .. but not at ALL pretentious ! even my bf felt comfortable here . i really wish i had the chance to try them out when they were at the kensington location . i heard it was even cozier ! servers were very attentive & everything came out timely . extra star just for the atmosphere & the service .  now the food .  for app: we ordered the escargot & foie gras (we always order foie gras whenever we can after trying them for the first time at hoof cafe!) . it was my very first time trying escargot and for such exotic food such as this, i expected it would be much more flavorful . foie gras was wonderful but we still prefer hoof cafe's . just a little . for entrees: my bf got the bison steak . it was good but some part of the steak was wayy too salty . perfectly cooked med rare tho . i had the game meat (elk that evening) and it was just okay . the bf liked it a lot more than i did . i LOVE french food so this was a bit of a disappointment . :( dessert: we just ordered what looked like a chocolate brownie . sounded amazing on menu, but nothing spectacular ."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate with my girlfriend, it was Valentines Day. It was very cozy inside as tables are very close together. It was dimly lit with lots of candles. This place reminded me of eating at a friends house as it looks like a home converted into a small restaurant.   This small little Kensington Market french restaurant is surprisingly delicious. The food is fresh and there are many different meats on the everchanging menu like elk and warthog. The prix fixe menu is affordable and has a lot to offer. Service is fast, friendly, and very knowledgeable. French food here is done very well and is full of flavor and they have a large list of beers to go with your meal.  Overall the food was very good and the atmosphere was very intimate with close tables, candle light, small kitchen, and friendly service. Good place for a date. It's a little pricey but it's expected especially since you can order meats you can't get anywhere else. With great French food to boost, it's hard not to like this little hidden restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant to have a celebratory meal.  Impromptu gathering last night of 5 people, and we had great food and fantastic wait staff.  The host is charismatic, charming and super nice!  He offered to give us a taste of any wine from the wine list before committing to a bottle.  When I was making a reservation for the impromptu birthday celebration I asked about bringing in my own cake and they said that was perfectly fine, but that there would be a cake plating fee, which I agreed to.  After paying the bill and coming home, I realized they did not apply the cake service fee -- I call that AMAZING customer service here in Toronto!  The food was spot on -- my steak frites were cooked to medium rare perfection.  Crispy little fries.  What a gem of a place - two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time going to this restaurant. Im in love.  Decor/Setting: - First thing I noticed was the open kitchen. It's a plus because it adds a sort of aura around the restaurant, hearing the pans, sizzling, etc. It's great.  - The inside of the restaurant is pretty sexy I must say. Lots of great french posters, beautiful bar, nice dim lights with candles (it's not that dark! just perfect). - Seats are a little crammed  Food: - Food was very good. I had the duck liver pate and the Steak frites done medium. Pate was very good, it was served with some veg and mustard, and just enough bread. The steak frites was excellent as well. The portion size was very good as well (I had the prix fix menu and I was expecting a tiny potion but it was pretty generous). Steak done perfectly, very very good. Fries were nice as well, but there were a couple that I didnt bother to eat because they were hard as rock.   Wine list was good as well.   Service: Seem like cool people, pushy when it came to wine. And didn't fill water often   Overall: Great restaurant. Do want to come back here  And just so you guys know: The menu in the restaurant is a little bit bigger, and they have specials in stuff. So dont think the menu on the website is all that they have"}
{"text":"Frequent this place for Brunch on Sundays as it has some of the best food and value in the city!   If you're a fan of soup, this is the place to go! Its rich, creamy and has the perfect about of favor combinations.   Other fav's are Eggs Benny served on a fresh croissant and croissant niciose which is a croissant with cheese and roasted veggies inside.   Fritters are also perfect, shoestring and cooked to a perfect crisp accompanied with a delicious garlic mayo dip."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere and service at La Palette!  The seafood terrine was very refreshing, it was light and was cooked differently from what I thought it would be - pleasantly surprised :) We've ordered the more exotic foods at the restaurant as well - definitely worth a try for the adventurous ones!"}
{"text":"As far as a French restaurant goes, have to say this hits all the important points.  From start to finish this place had that quaint French bistro feel. Best part was saying, I'm sure our server as French. He was France.    Their knowledge of the food and wine was on point even when we had a friend from a region in France the server was so good in talking to him about its nuisances versus the other choices available. We were all floored.  Classic French dishes. We had a variety of dishes - fish, chicken, steak, soup. We loved everything.  They even offer a great price fixe menu. Take advantage of it! I had the steak frites. Damn!!!!! Best one.   For dessert, of course creme brûlée. Tried the classic as well as the kahlua. Perfect! We also tried the chocolate mousse and the carrot cake dessert. Again, both delicious. However all of us were floored by the carrot cake. Fluffy, light but so flavourful.  Cocktails were on the strong side but.... still tasty.  I hear the brunch is just as solid. Just as a note, reservations at this place are 2 hours.   My new favourite go to place!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING, the atmosphere is PERFECT, and the service is IMPECCABLE! We had a table of four, all eating a prefix menu, plus the foie gras and bone marrow - and we couldn't be happier. I can not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Vivurlafrance. Had the Prix fix, starting with Escargot (beautiful),  Steak/Frites(VG), Flourless Choc cake (VG). My friend had chicken which was completely pink on the inside, but the server was very good about the error and cooked a new one from scratch.  I would give them the benefit of the doubt. Ambiance is intimate, music is fabulous at a nice low volume.  Bonne chance mes amies!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, thought it about time I write a proper review.  I go here for one reason: only place I know that does a great job with game meats. This is not a spot for vegetarians. Their mixed grill will offer things like wild boar, muskox, etc and is spectacular.   Also, Sunday brunch is a favorite of mine here; only place in the city that has eggs benny with wild game (venison, cheval, etc). The escargot is excellent as well.  So what else? Wine list = great. Service = great. This is just a reliable spot for great food and vibe.   Only complaint I have is the bread. For a place where every dish is generally great, the bread is almost always stale or just plain bad."}
{"text":"After searching and researching for a French restaurant open on a Tuesday in the city, which happened to be my birthday two weeks ago, I decided to make a reservation with La Palette. I wanted some typically French menu options at reasonable prices and was not interested in any type of Nouveau or Fusion creations, and I was certainly pleased with everything La Palette had to offer. The place was packed when we arrived so I was glad to have a reservation. We were greeted and taken to our table swiftly and our drink orders were taken very shortly after. Their website lists all sorts of beers, so I went to the bar to see what they had in stock and ordered a Barbar - fantastic! My boyfriend is a basic lager kind of guy and they had something for him too. We didn't look at the wine list because we don't tend to drink vino when we dine out, and I personally love to sample any different imported brew I can get my juicy little paws on... of which they had a surplus! For our apps we ordered the fromage fondant and charcuterie platter. The camembert was sublime! The moment you cut into it, it oozed all over the plate which was adorned with braised cabbage and candied walnuts, with crostinis on the side. Heaven! Each bite of the charcuterie was all equally as mouth watering as the last. It had an array of wild boar and duck cured meats, rillettes and pâté. Spectacular. For our mains my boyfriend ordered the duck breast and I had the duck & buck. I can't remember what his was accompanied with but mine was served overtop of a bed of barley risotto with juniper berries and veg. Honestly and truthfully, after each bite of food we took we both uttered 'mmmmmm'. I kid you not. It was impossible not to savour and enjoy every morsel!  Dessert of course was crême brulée, which was delectable but truth be told it wasn't best I've ever had. My only criticism of the evening would be about the brulée, which as others have mentioned should be served at room temperature. But if that's the biggest oversight of the evening, really, who cares? The overall experience was fantastic! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves typical French cuisine sans stuffy attitude."}
{"text":"A birthday celebration night in a nice French restaurant in Downtown core. Good service, Great wine selections and very good quality meat!! Quite expensive but it is worth the price..I'm lovin' it!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and french atmosphere! The place is a little small but very cozy and very European. We had the pâté, while boar and the venison tartare. Definitely will come back here again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is the main attraction for me at La Palette. You step into the space and suddenly you are in a cozy bistro in France. Complete with red checkered tablecloths, french posters on the walls, candles on the table and all the romantic mood that comes with it. The food is consistent with the atmosphere, with escargots, duck confit and other french classics on the menu. They have a special dish where they make a sausage out of a duck neck. It's not something I've ever seen anywhere else, so it's worth a try. For something less adventurous, the duck confit is a classic that is well executed here. The size of the mains are deceptively filling, so no worries about leaving hungry!"}
{"text":"Possibly the greatest date restaurant anywhere that I have seen.  Too bad that I was there alone, but I still enjoyed a great meal and a very pleasant experience.    We are talking about a hybrid decor of French \"country\" and retro arty; a small shelf of books with titles such as French Country Cooking, Home Sausage Making, and Lautrec by Lautrec; that absolutely perfect light level and lamp-lit color; fun but casual music at just the right volume; and warm, friendly service to top it off.  I also enjoyed the front doors standing open onto the warm night, but I would bet that even in winter this place has charm coming out of its ears.  Oh, and the food was great too!  In addition to the regular menu, they had about half again as many specials; so if what you see online doesn't tickle your fancy, go anyway.  I started with the soup du jour and the escargots.  I had never had the latter before, not because of any bias, just never feeling the desire in the right place and time.  But theirs were good--or good enough for my first time.  (How would I know?)  They are served in mushroom caps and garlic butter, with a few chopped red peppers.  I can't compare it to other escargots, but on its own I give it a thumbs up.  The soup was pureed red pepper with chorizo, cilantro, and creme fraiche.  It perhaps was not as lively or flavorful as I would have liked, but overall pretty good.  The crowning glory of my meal was the entree:  I chose the mixed grill (your choice of two or three meats from wild boar, horse, caribou, and bison) which felt a little like cheating because other than the cheval, none of those are traditionally French.  But I couldn't pass up the opportunity to add another \"exotic\" meat (caribou) to my scorecard.  Both meats were amazing.  Truly cooked to perfection, somewhere between rare and medium rare.  I've had wild boar a few times, but never like this.  Imagine a cross between a great pork tenderloin and a really really good New York strip.  And the caribou--if you've ever had elk, imagine that, but more tender and somewhat more savory.  I'm not sure if they seasoned these meats at all; if so, you couldn't tell, and if not, they didn't need it.  Wonderful, wonderful flavor.  Both were all-time 99th-percentile pieces of meat.  I got a little adventurous for dessert and chose the special creme brulee:  pink peppercorn and Drambuie.  It's an intriguing idea, and I can see how those flavors would complement, but I simply didn't like it.  The peppercorn left a bitter aftertaste with each bite, and I was still tasting it several hours later.  I will say this though:  whoever was wielding the torch back there is an expert at putting a crust on a creme brulee.  Somehow this humble little place has three beer taps, as well as several bottles, not to mention a respectable wine selection.  I could easily see spending several hours here soaking up the ambiance and the great food and drink (and, if you're lucky, the company).  It's tough for me to give five stars after one experience, but if I were local this would definitely be a regular spot and get the precious fifth star."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic.  We went a little crazy here and ate: - Oysters (5/5): a little trio of various types of oysters how cute - Foie gras (5/5):...its foie gras... - Duck confit (4/5): a beautifully prepared duck leg with a little corn and bean stew. Pretty hearty. - Trio of meats (5/5)..not sure what my friend got here, I believe it was horse, bison and duck. He seemed pretty happy! - Flourless chocolate cake: I am pretty sure it was good.. but I was too full to enjoy it =/  The ambiance, service and food are to point. I will be back."}
{"text":"La palette was a restaurant we stumbled on accidentally. It was a little restaurant on the side of the street with a quaint and cozy atmosphere. When we started eating we realized it was the best mistake we'd ever made.. the food was incredible. The wine selection was off the charts! And if I had to place it, I'd say this was in the top five best restaurants I've ever eaten at.. a must go in Toronto."}
{"text":"A beautiful gem on Queen West! Great French style food, selection of good wine and beer and the staff is super friendly!Great vibe every night!Ask to Casey for a delicious Genever Manhattan!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Excellent waiter, delicious food."}
{"text":"CLEARLY as you can tell... I'M a Foodie. I swear if i wasn't a veggie i would be a good 200 lbs lol but luckily for my metabolism i am not.   This place has been around for years and we all know why.   The man that runs this ship knows what he is doing and loves what he is doing.  French cuisine can definitely be an acquired taste. For those that are picky with their pallets i say ride on the wild side of your taste buds and give this place a try.   Everything is fresh and homemade which doesn't get any better than that.   With knowledgable and attentive staff this place make for a great group get together or a romantic evening."}
{"text":"**4.5 stars**  If you know me, you'd know that when I hear game meats, high ratings, and cozy atmosphere, I am there!  So I can't quite justify why it took me so long to finally check out La Palette. But I am glad I finally did... better late than never!  They offer a very good sized menu to satisfy a wide range of guests, from the tradition to the bit more adventurous, and from surf and turfers to vegetarians.  I absolutely loved the decor and the book of paintings!!  Escargots La Palette: $8 (4/5 stars) I LOVE snails! I love snails even more when its served with stuff, rather than just in an escargot dish with garlic butter and cheese (although there's nothing wrong with that).  By \"stuff\" I mean cool mushrooms and spinach and drenched in a LEMONY DILL BUERRE BLANC.  Never thought the memory of some snails would make me drool...  Moules aux Lardon : $12 (5/5 stars) There were so much stuff i wanted to get that \"mussels in broth of the day\" didn't quite seem exciting enough at first... until the server described it.  Then it was sold like King Cole! I think her magic words were \"lardon\" and \"butter\".  She even advised that the lardon were chunks of fat and bacon... even better!  Everything was delicious!  Quack and Track: $35 (4.5/ stars) 4oz horse tenderloin served juicy and rare with a leg of duck confit.  Sides of oats risotto and seasonal vegetables.  One of the better duck confits I've had.  Everything was cooked perfect.  I just prefer regular rice risotto over oats.  Bison Ribs: $?? (4/5 stars) Very good portion of meat!  Super flavourful and fall-off-the-bone tender, but edges were slight dried.  Service: (4 stars) Very nice, quite knowledgeable, and attentive.  Not bad, not amazing.  I promised myself I will come back.  It's a very nice space for a casual comfortable dinner with a date or a small group of friends.  The overall bill was slightly pricey, but food was great and Perhaps I will come back for brunch next time, assuming I will wake up early enough.... no, won't happen. Ok, dinner it is then!"}
{"text":"- Ambiance (4/5) La Palette seems like it's going for the casual French vibe, as you're using paper napkins and checkered table cloth, but then some of the design elements make you think it might be upscale.  Added all together, and you have a restaurant with a bit of an identity crisis; nonetheless, it's still warm and cozy-- certainly a great place to bring a date or have a quiet business discussion.  - Service (3/5) Service needed to be both faster and slower.  It took almost 20 minutes to place our order, water refills were slow, and by the time we got our entrees, we were more than an hour into the meal.  At the same time, the servers' movements needed to be more deliberate.  I was whacked in the head and shoulder a couple times by a flailing arm, and wine pouring turned into a noisy affair.  Our waitress was also a little reluctant to give us seconds on the bread basket-- not sure why.  - Bread (4/5) Homemade sourdough is soft and dense.  Great bread.  I just wish we had some truffle butter or something creamy to go with it other than plain olive oil.  - Prix Fixe, $35 (see rated elements below)  - Escargot (3/5) The escargots should have been the star of the plate, but instead, the wilted baby spinach was.  The hints of hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were great, but the escargot were kind of lost in the plate.  Visually too-- the escargot came hiding under the spinach.  The lemon dill beurre blanc tied everything together nicely, but I wasn't really sure what I was eating since the escargot were somewhat lost.  Also, I thought the menu said it had asparagus, but there was none on my plate.    - Duck Cassoulet (4/5) The duck leg meat was cooked perfectly, though I think more flavor could have been imparted.  The lardons were also a nice touch-- the chef was able to use it as a complementary ingredient, yet mute it enough that it didn't take over.  The rest of the veggies were great as well, but the duck broth it what elevates the dish.  Rich and delicious.    - Clafoutis (3/5) There wasn't anything terribly wrong with this dessert, though there was an overabundance of whipped cream.  It just tasted... very ordinary.  - Value (5/5) A $35 prix fixe meal is really good.  Although the meal wasn't the most spectacular meal I've had, it was good, and at $35, I'd consider it a steal.  At any other restaurant, this combination could have easily costed $45.    - Final Word Service mistakes were noticeable but didn't really cost La Palette.  They did however contribute to the overall lackluster feel.  While the place is a great deal and offers more than adequate ambiance, there's something missing in the food that just doesn't make it very memorable."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for dinner. We didn't have a reservation (highly recommended as his place gets busy quickly) but we were seated almost immediately. The restaurant was very romantic and cozy with a Parisian feel to it. The food and oysters were exceptional and the service phenomenal.  Our server was amazing she really took her time to make us feel welcome and explained everything with passion- some of the very best heartfelt service I've ever received in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We salvaged this mediocre experience by laughing together at the absurd service and offensively bad dessert.  Let's talk service: 1. We made a reservation weeks in advance and told them it was a special occasion.  Despite this, we were sat at the absolute worst table in the house rather than any of the other open, more appealing tables.  We were in the middle of the room, right next to foot traffic, and almost on top of the patrons at the next table.  It's extremely amateur for a restaurant not to take note of a reservation and special occasion.  This lack of attention was so disappointing.  2. We were escorted to a table where two patrons were still gathering their belongings.  Our host muttered under his breath \"I didn't think they would still be there.\" We shot apologetic looks to the poor couple frantically trying to get out of our way.  It was embarrassing for all of us EXCEPT for the one person who should have been embarrassed: the unprofessional host.  3. When explaining the specials, our waitress suddenly stopped in what seemed to be mid-sentence and just walked away.  We looked at each other and said \"wait, was she done?\"  4. The restaurant has an open kitchen so not only will you leave smelling like food (not in a good way), you are watching the cooks.  One of the cooks was wearing a tshirt and on the back was the backside of a half-naked woman wearing a thong.  This complaint makes me sound like an old lady, I realize, but when I go out to a nice restaurant (especially one claiming to be French), I expect a certain level of professionalism.  These are small details that can really add up.  Let's talk food: 1. We both ordered from fixed price.  $35.  Good price for the selections and the portions were what I would expect.  I started with soup which was delicious and then went with the duck confit.  It was okay but nothing special.  My date's entree was much better (white fish with pickled cauliflower) and I had serious food envy.  2. I almost want to give this place 1 star based on the absolutely terrible dessert.  This is a \"French\" restaurant - the dessert should be one of the highlights! I ordered a chocolate almond tort.  After trying a bite, my date accurately said: \"this tastes like it came out of an easy-bake oven.\" How does a dessert lack ANY flavor???? I was so disappointed and frankly insulted that they would even consider serving this.  We have no plans to return.  There are too many good restaurants in Toronto.  This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Almost missed this place. Glad I didn't. Menu was amazing, service was friendly while not over bearing, and the atmosphere was not at all pretentious."}
{"text":"I've only gone here for drinks a couple times and I'm meaning to eat there one of these days. I need to eat horse sometime.  They have a decent beer selection. Not a huge selection, but some different options from your average bar. The thing that really wins me about this place is the vibe. It has the kind of bar where you actually sit at the bar and maybe can even talk to the person sitting next to you. Some of the bartenders there are pretty cool too and are more than happy to explain anything on the menu to you and get into a conversation.  Last time I went they had some hungarian gypsy band playing. Pretty nice stuff."}
{"text":"My first experience at La Palette was the Rogue double IPA, great beer. The friend i was drinking with highly recommended the Burger (Lunch only). When i tried a bite i could see why. I returned a few days later to fully enjoy the experience. A perfectly prepared Burger, the bun is like no other i've tried before, the meat cooked to perfection, the Dijon mustard and caramelised onions add the flavour. I've tried burgers around the world and few match up to this one."}
{"text":"I went to La Palette recently with my favourite guy for a late dinner. We asked to be seated in the row of seats facing out the front window. I like the vibe here - it's cozy.  For appetizers, we ordered the fried camembert and the escargots - both were good.  For the main course, I ordered the horse tenderloin and my date ordered the chicken. The horse was flavourful and more tender than I expected horse meat to be. The chicken was interesting because the breast and the thigh were cooked differently - the (exceptionally moist) breast was roasted while the thigh was deep-fried and both were seasoned differently.   For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse and the creme brûlée. The chocolate mousse was very light but not chocolatey enough for my tastes. The creme brûlée came as three mini creme brûlées: vanilla, chocolate and lavender & honey. I like the lavender one the best.  I would go back for the chicken dish and the lavender & honey-flavoured creme brûlée.  Note to management: please don't pile the garbage on the sidewalk right in front of the restaurant. For those of us who were sitting at your window seats, looking out at garbage wasn't the most pleasant view."}
{"text":"A cute, quiet and romantic restaurant hidden away in the busy streets of queens ave....this is my first time eating French food and toronto and I have to say it was a interesting experience...they have a prix menu of 3 courses so I got the escargot as appetizer, duck leg confit and finishing up with a vanilla Creme Brûlée, the girlfriend ordered the salmon which was deliciousss, very exquisite taste and ingredients that they use, definitely will come back to this place to try the other entrees"}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to say enough about this place.  Brilliant!  Delicious!  Quirky!  I honestly felt like I was in Paris from the experience and the flavors.  I have to point out that there were some funny moments at the beginning of the meal, but some people may not find them very funny.  This was back in November 2009 and they had just that day painted the edges of the front door.  The paint was fresh and the insulating layer for the front entrance kept coming unglued and smacking people with wet white paint.  I saw a few ruined jackets that night, but it was almost comical as the waiters would run to the door as quickly as a patron had arrived, attempting to stop them from getting a splash.  In any case, I was sitting near the door and had an incident where I spilled water on my girlfriend - all because I was trying to protect a couple from getting a nice white stripe on their coats.  On to the food.  They had a very custom handwritten menu with specials.  It was very involved.  I stuck with some basics though.  Started with a seasonal butternut squash soup.  What I really wanted was the french onion, but they were out that night.  I'm not disappointed though because the butternut squash was more than a suitable replacement, it made me forget that it was a replacement at all!  Next was the Duck Confit (Confit de Canard) - mouth watering overpowering flavor - seasoned perfectly.  Made me forget about how cold and rainy it was outside.  I felt like I was in a comfortable Parisian cafe in the summer.  Service was excellent, friendly, conversational, yet prompt.  I guess if I was on the receiving end of the paint though, I might have dropped them a star, so consider yourself lucky, La Palette!  Haha.  One of the top-10 meals of my life.  Period."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the positive reviews. Our waitress was a remarkably awkward person. She is painfully inexperienced and I don't mean to be rude but she ruined the experience. We did the prix fixe menu and ordered a bottle of red which was fine, the steak was quite nice for the decent price but she was AWFUL. She doesn't have a clue how to do wine service, she gave us a messed up label, broke the cork because I could tell she didn't know how to use a crank, grabbed our glasses off the table to pour, walked away from taking our payment so we used the machines ourselves while she stood around doing literally shit-all, she took away napkins yet never gives them new ones. She also doesn't check up on us and there was only ONE other table for half the time we were there. I frankly think she needs to be retrained. Without washing her hands, she was cutting bread on the side, never once topped up our wines or water and was just so cringeworthy. Kitchen staff were enjoying a pint of beer out right in the open and left the frothy mug in visible sight.  This place blows. I will never come back."}
{"text":"This place was perfect.  Service was excellent, friendly, classy, and made great recommendations.  I took my mom here when she was in town and it was exactly right for what we needed, but it's a great place to stop for a cocktail later in the evening as well.  Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Nice old-fashioned place in French style. I I liked the atmosphere, this place is ideal for romantic dates (what you can't say about every bistro/restaurant!). The food is delicious but it's mouthwatering desserts what's really worth trying!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I am still astonished by the experience I've just had there - and I needed it.   It's been a while I've been looking for new experiences in food, and La Palette provided me exactly what I was looking for. I shared from the appetizer to the dessert, including the wine with my husband and everything was perfect for the two of us.   We started with the venison tartar, you shouldn't miss it! Delicious! Then, came the main dish: the three-way musk ox - now, this is THE THING, YOU WANT THAT. It's a musk-ox sausage, musk-ox tenderloin and musk-ox ragu served with magic sauce and everything delicious. The tenderloin is SOOO TENDER you can't believe it's not butter (ha).  It's one of those things you have to try before you die. I'm glad I did.   For dessert, we ordered the creme brulée trio. I've had, about eight years ago (yeah, man) an AMAZING CRÈME BRULÉE EXPERIENCE that I'll never forget (for those curious, the place is called Bar D'Hotel, in Rio de Janeiro). Finally, I've had a similar experience! And, I LOVE CRÈME BRULÉE!   Service was impeccable, fast, friendly, perfect. I have no words to describe.   If there's something I don't like there? Although I think the idea of having the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant seems super cool and modern, you end up smelling like food. I don't want that after spending lots of money in a restaurant. The stairs to the washroom are greasy for obvious reasons.   Still, I loved it and plan to come back really soon. I am in love."}
{"text":"One of my very favourite restaurants in the city right now. Consistently spectacular food - very nice french based wine list, knowledgeable staff and did I mention the spectacular food? The menu is very meat heavy and I'm a vegetarian but I do eat fish and they always have a lovely local fish special that is delicious. All of my meat eating friends agree its delicious, well cooked and decent portions. I highly recommend getting the creme brulee trio for dessert!  I've also had the risotto, tuna, escargot, oysters, and my friend can't stop talking about the wild boar. Everything is here top notch.  They also do a beautiful breakfast/brunch. Coffee is delicious and decor is warm and welcoming.  While i haven't stayed for this I have seen the transformation from dinner to live band which looks fun for a Friday/Saturday night outing."}
{"text":"Bordering 2.5-3*.  Just no 'wow' factor for me.  Not great, but not rotten either.  I was really looking forward to dining at La Palette for my bday.  However, reading a coupla trusted Yelper reviews, I had the suspicion that this place was BETTER before.  Restaurant was only a little over 1/4 full on a Sunday night for dinner service, so I think you're safe without reservations.  Don't quote me though!  Highlights: -  fried Camembert app - $10 -  Dark & Stormy drink with Thomas Lavers ginger beer...but it was like $12 -  there is a prixe fixe for $35 (on select apps/mains/desserts), but the portions are smaller - still fair size though!  Lowlights: -  staff wasn't busy enough/too many waitresses.  As per another review, they were too present.  For example:  were asked for our order many times without enough time in between, waitresses tried to take away my bf's salad TWICE, was asked what I thought of the food less than a minute after it was put on table -  décor is dated, tres '90s/French grandmere's masion, blech -  prices are on the higher-end (at least $25-40 for a main), but staff/decor does not match the price.  Dined at l'Express last Spring in Montreal and experience was waaay more upscale, white table cloths, garcons in uniforms, with lower prices -  Darjeeling Creme Brulee - ok, but just tasted like custard.  No darjeeling taste.  Maybe pick something more distinct like Earl Grey?  Maybe I'm just not meant to dine at these \"fancier\" places, but I thought the food was waaay too rich and not balanced.  I ordered the cou de Canard - basically a duck sausage - and waitress warned me that it came with the head.  (I'm Chinese, that's fine.)  However, when it arrived, she said that the entire head was edible 'cept for one bone (don't remember)...which it wasn't 'cause I was spitting out the skull and felt like puking after I ripped the jaw off to see what meat was there.  I just left it 'cause it was just unappetising for me.  Dish was not balanced and it was literally like eating an entire dish of sliced sausages.  The same type of sausage.  Wild rice was IN the actually sausage, but dish needed something else aside from a few French string beans and 2-3 pieces of artichoke.    Dish was also different temps.  Sausage was room temp while duck head was just out of the deep fryer.  Not enjoyable.  Dish also smelt a bit 'off' when it first arrived, but I'm not sure if that was the cheese (parmesan?) or not as I'm not a reg cheese eater.  Maybe if they revamped their menu, made it more casual, and lowered their prices they would find more success."}
{"text":"I would come here all the time if I lived in Toronto. I've been to tons of restaurants all over the U.S. and France, and this is up there with the top of them.  - Great atmosphere. Small and comfortable, without feeling as pretentious as some French places can sometimes be. - Wonderful service. Prompt, friendly, and really helpful with making food choices or selecting the right wine pairing. - Fantastic food. Everything we got from the appetizer and entree menu was delicious. I had the horse tenderloin -- and if you like beef and just want something a tiny bit gamier -- I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate and couldn't be happier! The atmosphere was quite cozy and intimate. Our server was patient and knowledgeable! I had the prix fixe which was a great value ($37 for pâté, duck confit, and a dessert). Servings were large and everything was of good quality. Can't wait to try the mussels next time!"}
{"text":"Want an amazing gluten-free meal after 10 in Toronto? Want a trip to France for about $130, for two? Do you want impeccable service and beverage recommendations with samples? Do you want your food to elevate your taste buds and take you on a ride to flavor-town? Eat here. Please! I can't say enough good things about this place. My bf and I were desperate for a bite to eat after traveling all day to Toronto for the first time. Unfortunately, I have Celiac's and I can't just eat anywhere we walk by. This was a little piece of heaven in a sea of fried bar foods. You will not forget your experience here! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"La Palette is one of my favourite special occasion dinner places. Great food, awesome servers, and a friendly, laid back vibe.  To start we had Mussels in Thai Curry Sauce ($12 for 1/2 lb) from the daily specials, Escargot ($7), and the Charcuterie Board ($15 for a small). The Thai curry sauce wasn't very authentic, but the mussels were awesome nonetheless. The escargot are served in mushroom caps and they don't go overboard with butter or garlic so you can actually taste them.  As for the charcuterie, all I ever hear people talking about these days is fucking charcuterie. So, I figure it was about time I try it for myself. Call me a philistine, but I don't see what all the hype is about. There were maybe 8 different meats - most made in house - and two tiny pieces of each. Although I have nothing to compare to I'd say it was good and it probably took a lot of skill and effort to make. Still there's a lot of other things I'd rather eat for $15.  They usually have a variety of interesting meats on offer. I've seen horse, bison, boar, elk, venison, and caribou. On my most recent visit, though, I went for straight up Steak Frites ($27). The frites are shoestring style  and were served with a tarragon mayo; perfectly cooked and season, they kicked ass. My only complaint about the whole meal is that I asked for my steak rare and it came overcooked. I rarely eat steak, but when I do I like to taste the blood. It was still damn good though.  Highly recommended. I'd give La Palette 5 stars if it wasn't for the steak being overcooked."}
{"text":"Authentic French!  I'd give it 5 Stars if it wasn't because of 1. their kind of condescending waiters 2. slower service 3. price If you are looking to eat some really authentic french appetizers, you'd have to make a trip to this place. Oh and their wine selections are just fantastic. Definitely try their Steak Tartar and/or Pate with your RED wine.  If there is a couple of you and your are ordering a bottle of wine, expect your bill to be somewhere around $150-200."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food and service is always on point. I recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"We had a fun time here last night but unfortunately it was mostly due to our laughing at poor service and awkward observations. The ambiance is intimate and cozy but the service and food leave something to be desired.   I called weeks ago to make a reservation for two and the voice on the other end of the line was surprised to have me making a reservation so far in advance. I let him know this was a special occasion. When we arrived, our table wasn't quite ready which was totally fine but then we were led to the very center of the restaurant and instructed to have a seat at a table where two people were still sitting and gathering their things. I kid you not; we literally had to watch other patrons get up, try to resist giggling at the awkwardness, and apologize for rushing them. Despite making reservations and explaining the special occasion, we were given the worst table in the house.   After we sat, our server came by and started to speak to us and then out of nowhere, she stopped mid sentence and walked away to another table. These were just a couple of the bizarre experiences with staff.   We ordered a martini and negroni and they were quite good. We both chose prix fixe selections: My date had a good soup to start and then duck confit. The duck was tasty but the bed of beans it sat on top of lacked flavor. I had moules to start which were excellent and then the poisson dish. The poisson was the hit of the night for us. It consisted of a perfectly prepared piece of smoked white fish and potatoes with pickled cauliflower. I highly recommend it. The desserts were quite disappointing. I had a lemon tart that was uninspired and my date had an awful almond and chocolate torte.   It wasn't a cheap meal to say the least and our clothes and hair still wreak of food from the open air kitchen and mediocre ventilation."}
{"text":"Found this place wandering around on our first day in Toronto. Started our day drinking here. Very chill place. The owner and staff were very friendly and chatted with us while we enjoyed our drinks. Had a Canadian cider. It was pretty good. This is a great place to hang out during the day or even for nightlife. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Honestly thought this place would've been way better than it was. Not having often been around the area, I -naively- made reservations for a Friday night; we had our choice of tables. Even so, service was cordial.   However, we were subtly rushed out. (Maybe because we were occupying the prime table?)  service was professional, but also felt a bit condescending for some reason.   For me, the food tasted microwave-reheated. I had the fish. I'm not sure what was on the side, but It was like a hard-as-a-rock hash brown topped with sardines and olives, and I couldn't cut into it, and didn't want to try it.  My partner had the steak and loved it. So I guess it depends on what you like/order.   The whole theme is kitschy-French bistro. (On the menu: let us know if you're on some kind of weird cleanse) !"}
{"text":"La Palette is a pretty interesting place. If you want to go out for a very non-kosher meal, this is a decent spot. Lots of exciting meats like horse and musk ox. I tried at least 3 meats that night, including horse, musk ox and bison. I liked the horse and the bison but could've passed on the musk ox. It tasted kind of like organ meat (liver maybe) and I can't stand that taste.  The decor is relaxed. The atmosphere is cozy (read: stuffy). Service is friendly.  The wine was mediocre, actually, somewhat disappointing for the price-point.  This location is closing down. A new one opened on Queen West.  Overall, meat was cooked properly and served with some decent sides, none of which I can retain in my memory (that good huh?)  Definitely worth a try, but I doubt I'd be going back. I'd say 3.5 stars if I could.  To put in my 2¢ about protesting horse meat: I think all animals should have equal treatment regardless of how cute and cuddly they are or how much they remind you of My Little Pony, and that fair treatment is to be raised humanely and then cooked to delicious perfection and served alongside some equally tasty carbs."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this place, I really do. Some really good memories here. A great intimate spot for those who want to share a bottle of wine, snack on some food, and want to actually have a conversation.   Some pretty controversial items on the menu, as they do serve several horse options. I'm indifferent as I dive into my horse tartare, but many other options for the less adventurous folk. Cheese and Charcuterie are always safe bets, and I really like their beverage program. That said, I do have to mention that the quality of food, and choice of options the past couple years have slightly been disappointing. Hopefully this changes quick because I do like coming here every now and then."}
{"text":"Very pricey but yummy.  I had horse and a number of game items off of their menu. All delicious.  Best surprise was the deep fried camembert that  exploded molten cheese all over my plate .....Mmmmmmmm.   Ambiance is pretty chill for an expensive french place."}
{"text":"me and my boyfriend popped in here for a drink because it looked really warm and inviting. the bartender was really friendly and tried his best to work with my picky requests (something with tequila but nothing too girly or sweet)- he gave me a tequila sunrise which was alright and then made me another drink using  shot of tequila and gingerbeer. it was something ive never tasted before so i liked that he was able to surprise me  i would come back to try the food and for a romantic night out -the atmosphere is so nice."}
{"text":"Had brunch here recently.   Service was good, although, the restaurant was near empty (only 3 tables occupied) so it was hard to be slow. The brunch menu was a bit uninspiring, although I was tempted by the eggs Benedict variations with horse meat. I opted for a daily omelette with bacon and red peppers. It arrived and it was soooo BACONY. Yum!   My friend ordered an eggs benny though, and unfortunately the eggs were WAY overcooked - yolk completely hard. She returned it and was brought a second plate, this time with the eggs a bit undercooked. Not acceptable really - when your brunch menu has 6-7 eggs benny options, ideally the chef should know how to poach an egg. God."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the absinthe. They have three varieties. But unfortunately they were very rude to myself and my friend afterwards. While I don't live here, my friend is a regular here, and neither of us shall be returning."}
{"text":"When it comes to French food and restaurants, I am difficult and demanding.  During my visit there, several mistakes occurred that made this experience not the best.  The charcuterie platter is OK, although  pieces of terrine and pate are very small (this is pate, not caviar!). Duck confit was not juicy enough (in a nutshell, too dry) and for me the major error is to serve it warm (well, lukewarm) on a cold just-out-of-the-fridge lentil salad! Put the salad aside! or even better, serve the lentils warm! in a good light sauce... or a greasier one, with duck fat...  Creme brûlée is too thick and powdery (do they add maizena in it?).  The service was much too present. After asking twice for each dishes if everything is OK, you just want to start asking for some privacy!"}
{"text":"There are few places when you go on vacation you rave about to people later. This is a kitschy hole in the wall I would urge ANYONE to go visit on a trip to Toronto. Bartender was very friendly and had me sample a number of wines to make sure I was happy with my selection. You can see the chef cook your food with a open concept space, I love this idea because the space has to be very organized and clean. Food was prepared perfectly and they have a great fresh menu. I had the Creme Brule for dessert and I almost died it was so good!"}
{"text":"Let's even call it 3.5 .... OK call me simple in a restaurant with a solid menu full of exquisite meats ... i am still craving my standard sirloin :) I tasted my friend's bison ribs, which were literally fall off the bone juicy and tender.  I know that is an expression, but I'm talkin those bones were clean as a whistle cuz all meat just slid right off.   Back to my steak.  Meeei ... I opted for the 6oz version on the prix fixe menu in order to enjoy the sweet potatoe soup and cafe creme brule for dessert ($32) over the 8oz at $28 plus $7 for soup + dessert. The steak was tender.  The sauce was great.  The fries were fresh and hot hot hot.  Still that steak only rates a 8.75/10 ... a bit more tender and a hair above (the never to be knocked and only marveled) Keg quality. Its a shame I notice I'm more interested in the one bite of the bison rib. Cremebrule cup could barely fit my spoon inside.  Damn French. 3 different guys served our table.  1 stunk of cigarette smoke.  Authentic French. I'd walked by this place enough times to finally drop in for a late night meal and glass of red.  It surely didn't disappoint.  I am very pleased to see Queen street toward the Spadina end get some better quality restaurants.  All in favour.  \" I \" ... There, the \" I's \" have it.  In summary:  - food  8/10 - style and decor:  7.5/10 - ambiance and vibe: 7.5/10  - cleanliness & presentation: 8/10 - service & timing: 8/10 - value for money: 8/10"}
{"text":"Yes. Great authentic French feel, Queen St classic. You cannot go wrong. N'est pas possible. Best and most dynamic charcuterie board in Nouvelle Monde."}
{"text":"Ordered the bison and got a much bigger portion than anticipated. Quite yummy, but being that it was my first time trying bison outside of a burger, I don't have much to compare.  Got the pate to start, but was not what I expected...I thought I was getting that soft, mushy, spreadable kind of pate with a lot of flavour. This one reminded me a bit of softened ham. Meh! S'alright!  The winner was my friend's dish, which he let me try. Steak Frites topped with Fois Gras (an extra $25 but worth every penny). Simply amazing. The kind you close your eyes and chew slowly and wonder how you've gone so long without. Next time, I'll be wise and get that one!"}
{"text":"Best bar and bartenders in toronto...especially david.   There is cache to a restairant that tells rude or entitled customers to go fuck themselves. This is one of those places.   As an asshole...i love it"}
{"text":"Landed here after reading a few reviews for a French restaurant that served foie gras. In summary...I am definitely impressed. I have had my fair share of French cuisine around the world and I'm happy to have found this gem in Toronto.  * Ambiance = very homey and felt like I was sitting in a restaurant in Paris. For an expensive menu, it was definitely not pretentious. This restaurant used to be in Kensington market and though I have not eaten at the previous location, you can kind of visualize the vibe in the restaurant.    * Full bar with lots of alcohol choices.  noticed people on laptops enjoying a drink after work... or while working...   * Corkage is $25.   * Server / hostess was very friendly and will let you eat in peace, with the occasional visits.   * Food was definitely the highlight. Foie Gras & Chacuterie as appetizers. 3 huge pieces of Foie Gras for $25?  And maple glazed with blueberry? Can't go wrong. We underestimated the portion sizes. Was expecting just one piece but it came with three and it was one of the most delicious ones I've had. Chacuterie was delicious too, with duck prosciutto and pulled duck - which were exceptional. For entree we had Horse tenderloin & Wild boar special, and the confit de canard. Confit de canard was very tasty, with very very crispy skin which is a plus. Would have been excellent with foie gras on top of the confit but that's how I would have served mine. Not new to horse, but definitely never had the tenderloin before, and it reminded me very much of beef and it was very tender and juicy. Wild Boar was good too. Would definitely order this again.   * This is a place I'd recommend anyone interested in French food. Don't be fooled by the price on the menu because the portion sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"Service is OK but the food is really good. Try the foie gras, escargots and steak frites. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Drop by La Palette for brunch on a Sunny Sunday afternoon. If you love and enjoy the warm sunshine, make sure you sit at the front of the restaurant... I have to wear my sunglasses while enjoying my brunch!  Eggs Benedict  with hollondaise on ricotta herb biscuits with Wild boar belly shank crepinette ($14) was A-OK. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the wild boar belly was tender..... The only thing I can complain was my salad was drowned in the really sour dressing...  Services was hit and miss...I wouldn't say I was neglected, but not overly attentive...  I might come back for the Prix Fixe menu and give La Palette another try!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I returned to La Palette because it is a special place to us. We celebrated our anniversary, and I cannot express how amazing La Palette was with helping to accommodate one of the most memorable nights we've had. They helped receive flowers from the flower shop, and it was setup nicely on the table when we arrived. The service was absolutely stellar... this is no exaggeration, and it's the reason why we keep coming back. Thanks so much guys!!!"}
{"text":"Environment: 5/5 Employees: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Drinks: 5/5 Cost: 4/5 Accessibility: 2/5 Total: 26/30  Story Time:  The Toronto Crew (Steven, Nick, Austin, Tom and me) decided on a whim to just go to Toronto and stay there one night.  And..they were all straight, except for me of course.  And if you know me, you would know that I don't go with just straight guys to anywhere.  I had to take this opportunity and wave my gay wand around.  Before arriving here, we went to a place called Bar Chef, which was full of shit, but from that shit they suggested we come to La Pallette for French food.  We took the advice with a grain of salt, but it turned to the best thing that touched our tongues.  What is this magical place with magical food and magical music.  I felt like the queen I am being serenaded and indulging in utterly awesome food.  Synopsis:  I did the course meal as my friends did the horse meat and duck leg.  Everything that I tried was amazing, even the ciders they had.  Just ugh...on-point with everything, even the service.  Are we still in Toronto, or heaven?  Environment: A rectangular restaurant that was dimly lit for a more intimate setting and to keep the ugly peope pretty. Hahahha.  We were sat all the way in the back, because you know they like to put baby in the corner. Hahhaa. No, but seriously it was very nice restaurant, which apparently the bar turns into a stage and a bunch of gypsies just play music.  Employees:  This was the cherry on top!  So very awesome.  When I left, I had my muscle bowl still on the table, but wasn't finished with it.   I was told the busser took it and then the waitresses retracted that execution and brought it back because she knew I wasn't finished drinking the broth.  Food: Where to even begin on the journey of awesomeness!  Bread: What?  This condensed homemade bread as amazing.  The best bread, from a restaurant, that I have ever tasted.  I swear we had thirds of this.  Thank goodness I am not diabetic! 5/5    Escargot: Not the best I have ever tasted, but not the worst.  I loved how it was displaced and it gave you a nice mouthful, especially with their amazing bread!  4/5   Muscles: Holy mother of Jesus!  This was out of this world good.  I don't know what the broth was made out of, but I'm sure my blood pressure sky-rocketed as I started drinking it like soup.  I even used the bread to soak up all the salty-goodness.  5/5  Horse Meat: I have horse meat before and it was gamey.  Some how with their magical powers, they made the meat tender and \"melt\" in your mouth like BUTTTAAHHH.  After sampling a taste, I was ban from getting seconds. Aww...how can you be so mean?  5/5  Duck: Although this was the least of my favorite meats in comparison, it was still good.  I mean, it's duck.  It wasn't dry at all, and the crispy skin!  I'm so glad my friend couldn't finish it all because I DEVOURED it as if it was my last suppah! 5/5  Fruit Custard:  This was actually my least favorite out of the entire course.  I was kind of disappointed that the follow-up of all the delicious food didn't come with a wonderful tasting dessert.  It was meh... I could have honestly done without.  Perhaps more sugar in the crust?  A more of a twist to it?  Cream cheese? I have no idea.  3/5  Drinks:  Thomas Lavers Ginger Beer:  This thing...omg, was the best ginger beer I had in my life.  It was the elixir of life and every one of us wanted more of it.  We loved it so much that we made it a point to TRY TO FIND IT THE NEXT DAY and bought every single bottle a small shop had.  This was with the Dark and Stormy drink.  Very delicious! 5/5  St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout: With coffee and chocolate flavors, it really seemed like it was a Guinness but even better.  I love my beers dark like my men ;) 5/5  Apple Cider with Bourbon:  Definitely best with bourbon, secondary vodka. It was sweet, but beautifully made.  With the bourbon, it was a nice smooth spiral down your throat. 5/5  Apple Cider with Vodka: Definitely a no, no.  This was more of a bumpy ride down your throat.  2/5  Cost: Definitely on the pricey side, but because the dollar is stronger it was a \"little\" cheaper.  IT WAS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY worth it though.  So delicious.  I want seconds.  Accessibility:  Well the public transportation isn't great....and you need either a car or the cab."}
{"text":"Superb. The braised bison short ribs with bay scallops, toasted barley, cherry tomatoes, shallots -  a masterpiece of comfort food. The horse tartar and oysters - fantastic start.   Some of the best service in the city - great attention to making you feel like a very welcome guest. From ownership to host to waiter - they make the difference.   Live music after sealed the deal - our favourite French in the city. The band Rambunctious play from time to time - unmissable experience!"}
{"text":"We love it here. The service is so exceptional I thought our waiter owned the restaurant. It's so unpretentious and the food is amazing. It's really cozy and romantic. We come here everytime we're in Toronto. I highly recommend it.  BTW, they have horse! My husband loved it but it's not my thing. That is legal in Canada. It's also in a nice area to walk around after dinner. Feels like you're in Paris, not North American.  I hope you enjoy it."}
{"text":"Horse meat. They say you should try it at least once. I had the platter with my colleague there. He took me there as it is his favorite French spot. Wild boar, venison, and cheval.  My favorite was wild boar. Cheval was perfectly tender. My colleague also ordered the escargot. Delicious. I also loved walking to and from the restaurant. Queen street was amazing. Somehow it reminded me of the 1990s south Philly, but clearly more hip, and has a lot of great restaurants along the way. We got lucky, the evening was warm and many were sitting outside as the rain came down. Also reminded me of summer in Paris. I am now a bit of a Toronto fan, having just spent 6 days there for work and for play. I would go back in a heart beat and I will definitely be going back. And I will have to go back to the same restaurant. How come they don't serve cheval in San Francisco? What about wild boar? I already miss it."}
{"text":"This small boutique restaurant is an amazing find and can't believe I've never been here before!   Staff, food, and atmosphere are equally amazing! The camembert with pear is one of my favourite dishes.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I recently went to La Palette for a family birthday dinner and I was pleasantly surprised at how accommodating the server was of my dietary preferences - I am vegetarian and I thought there would be NO way that a meat-centric restaurant known for its unusual offerings would have anything vegetarian, but the server pointed out several items that could be modified and even offered to specially make a pasta dish customized to my request. I ordered an outstanding creamy pasta dish with fresh peas, green beans, mint and broccoli."}
{"text":"La Palette was more than a restaurant, it was a fun evening: - The owner was behind the bar and talked to us before we sat down, even showing us some of the dishes as the headed from the kitchen to the customers. - Stephanie, our waitress, was super nice. - The food was very good.  My colleague had venison ribs.  I had  two small steaks -- one horse, the other elk.  Both came accompanied by assorted vegetables appropriate for the season. - Except for me, the crowd was pretty cool.  Lots of funky clothes.  That said, three well-heeled couples in suits and ties and stylish dresses came and fit right in.  A couple of things to watch out for: - Noise.  This is a noisy locale. - Personal space.  The tables are pretty darn close together. - Smokey.  The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant.  The advantage is that you can watch the chefs cook.  The downside if that the smoke overwhelmed the exhaust fan the night we were there and the restaurant smelled a bit smokey.  I had a great time at La Palette.  Unusual but good  food in an unpretentious, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great location. Great venue. Great staff.  Great cocktails.  Great vibe.  Good food (to be fair only tried one item)  Home runs 5 outta 6 not bad!!"}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time on my way to Loblaw's to get groceries, and I'd always wanted to try their prix fixe.  I finally came here one night for a celebratory evening with a friend.  Pros: *Our first server was very good.  He helped us choose a great wine, and he took good care of us. *The escargot was very nice - it's super lightly breaded and fried, which is unusual, but it tasted great and the tangy sauces + wild mushrooms went great with it. *The house made sourdough was very nice, if a little dense, and the infused olive oil was very tasty. *My friend ordered the steak frites and the fries were AWESOME. Super crispy. *The prix fixe is a great deal. *The decor is very lovely. *I loved how their wine list is placed in an art book! And the selection, while small, is great. *The dishes are presented beautifully.  Cons: *The food wasn't that great, which is what I came for. *The duck confit was dry, and I came here because I was craving the awesomely juicy one I had at Cafe St. Malo in Quebec City!  I also didn't like the wild rice and sauce it came with. *My friend's steak was overcooked and tough. *Our second server wasn't very good - she was very conspicuous in checking on us, which made me feel rushed.  She also tried to take away plates as we were still eating, and she brought out the wrong dessert for one of us.  She was polite, but just not very good at her job - but maybe she was new. *The flourless chocolate cake wasn't as cocoa-y as I imagined it'd be and it was kind of dry. *We ordered a vanilla creme brulee but we were brough a salted chocolate.  We didn't want to bother with waiting for the order to be corrected so we just went with it.  I did not like this at all!  There was a lot of salt in it and didn't taste like a dessert.  Not tasty.  So all in all, my curiosity about this place has been satisfied, and I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, had a three course meal. Disappointed with their vegetarian options i had limited choose and everything tasted so bland & lacked flavour. Concerned since the cook was wearing shorts and didn't look clean at all. Overall it was a disappointment wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"My baby daddy and I love a good French date night. Unfortunately, the realities of work, a toddler and the daily grind have made this luxury an impossibility lately. I spotted a hole in both of our calendars this week, so I jumped at the chance for us to have a childless lunch date.   We wandered down Queen W and La Palette popped out at both of us. We snuggled up at one of their cute, colourful tables and got down to delicious business: Sparkling water, (a little) rosé, fromage fondante (deep fried cheese, yes) and steak frites. It was all perfection.   Oui will be back. Often."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this French restaurant! The food is very authentic to French cuisine and the ambience of the restaurant is very cozy and fun. I recommend getting the pix fixe, it's totally worth it and there are lots of choices. We had the pate to start, mussels and fries, the chicken, and creme brûlée and sorbet. This is a great spot if you want to impress someone or go for a nice evening out."}
