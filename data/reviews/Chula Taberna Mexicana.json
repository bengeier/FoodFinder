{"text":"The neighbourhood definitely needed a Mexican restaurant and Chula does not disappoint! We got the guacamole to start (awesome), chicken enchilada and a bunch of different tacos. All the tacos were amazing but the beer battered fish ones were our favourite. Had churro sundae and fudge duo for dessert and both were phenomenal. We tried almost all of the margaritas and they were all great! The vibe here is great and the service was top notch. We had a very fun evening!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Chula to check it out the other night, and here's our general assessment: the food, drinks, and atmosphere (read: patio) were quite good; the service was not. Pricey, but not outrageous.  Food: We shared the pico de gallo, and I had a shrimp taco (although I'd ordered fish - see 'Service', below) and the mushroom burrito.   We also shared the churro sundae and the fudge plate. Everything was very good - fresh, flavourful, satisfying, good portions, and not too heavy (except dessert, but hey, when you order a churro sundae you know what you're in for).  Drink: I had a cocktail, which was very nicely constructed; a good balance of sweet/dry. The beer selection looked good as well.  Atmosphere: we were outside on a sunny day on comfortable furniture - can't ask for more than that!  Service: Some of the issue can be chalked up to inexperience and understaffing, but a lot was a simple lack of polish and organization. I think the layout may also have contributed - pathways are a smidge tight and the bar seems to be a specific area of difficulty (although I usually expect to wait longer for a cocktail, the beer took even longer).  I want to be clear- everyone was very friendly, energetic and kind, which is the most important thing. However, all the staff seemed to lack important service basics - empty plates/glasses were left on the table throughout our meal; dishes went to the wrong table, or werethe wrong order; it took our neighbours 15 minutes to get water; servers were having what should have been private conversations about restaurant issues in front of diners, etc. etc.  I'm rooting for Chula, and I do recommend it! I just hope that the service issues can be sorted out before too long, and I can update this review :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the butterflied shrimp tacos to go... I don't recommend.. They tasted burnt and the shrimp were rubbery, they lacked flavor, well, maybe they had flavor but was masked by the overly charred flavor.. Not to mention they need way better take out containers, what a mess when I got back to the office. I really wanted to like these guys, might try again but def not the shrimp."}
{"text":"First time here a few days ago. Had the tortilla chips with all 3 dips and pork burrito bowl. I love burritos but don't particularly like it being in the wrap. The burrito bowls were an excellent and tasty alternative. Everything was delicious and the customer service was on par. I'll definitely be back again! L"}
{"text":"We went here tonight to celebrate my moms birthday. It was a nice night and we had a reservation so we were able to score a seat on the patio. Me and my husband ordered mixed drinks, a margarita and a \"Mexican sunrise\". Both were delicious, came cold and refreshing, the bar tender gave us a solid pour. We decided to order a bunch of different things just to try. We tried: the carnita tacos (3), the zucchini fritters, the chorizo corndogs, the brisket burrito, the shrimp ceviche and the chicken lollipops. There were no complaints  by anyone. Everything was very fresh, service was frequently and efficient. Dishes came out as they were ready (as indicated on the menu). The corndogs are a bit heavy, and fritters my favourite item, was a wee bit oily but nothing you can't get over. I ordered a sangria towards the middle of the meal and I didn't get it until we were almost finished. This meant I had to chug it before we could leave. It would not deter me from coming back however. The patio was quite congested, I think they have one too many chairs out there, but it's a good vibe so again no complaints. The tiki hut on the back patio is so cute, a very nice touch. Overall, a great new addition to the neighbour, any Mexican food lover will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Busy little spot, make reservations for the weekend.  Boozy margaritas, quick service.  Good selection of tacos, but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"A beautiful and cozy little place! Randomly found it while walking around. The interiors are very nice, and clean. They have two patios and excellent custom service. The server was friendly, quick and had great suggestions. This is a great place for families with small kids to visit.  They have a great menu and tons of vegetarian items. We tried the corn, zucchini tacos and fried avocado.   The corn was excellent, their version of elotes. Definitely a must try. The zucchini tacos were yummy as it was crispy and has a good amount of salsa. The fried avocado was ok, was not a huge fan and was one small avocado for the price of $9. The prices were okay, but portion sizes were small. The chula beer was excellent and another must try. Also got a margarita with black salt! It was tasty and pretty.   Would come back here and try other items on their menu but mostly the corn and chula beer again!"}
{"text":"I actually expected more out of this restaurant, not saying they're bad or anything but I had higher expectations. We ordered the guacamole and a bunch of tacos but nothing really stuck. I was comparing their food to Seven Lives in Kensington and I must say, Chula's fish tacos was lacking. The batter was thick and heavy and not enough flavour. Their carnitas was a disappointment because it was dry and flavourless.   The ambiance was nice and cozy though but they kept opening the back door when we were there so it definitely got cold (we went on one of the colder days in January). Service was adequate and prices were very fair but overall, I would not return because I rather pay a little more for better quality."}
{"text":"Food (smoked brisket plate and pork burrito bowl) had lots of flavour, but both my husband and I agreed that they were a bit *too* salty, especially the pork dish.  Atmosphere was *very* loud.  Service was just okay.  Overall, passable, but lots of other good Mexican restos in the city."}
{"text":"Meh. The flavours are good but the quality of the food is not much better than what you'd get at a Mexican fast food place.   That said, the decor is quite hip, the rooftop patio is killer, and the staff are lovely."}
{"text":"Went in here with a group of 6 friends and had a lovely time. The staff were very friendly and our orders came promptly. The only thing I have to say is that the food tends to be on the spicier side. If you can't handle heat that well, please let your server know so they can give our recommendations or accommodate!   The beer battered fish was delicious but the butterflied shrimp taco was too spicy for me and my friends. Definitely recommend the fish tacos and cactus dip."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good overall - we sampled pretty much everything: tacos, burritos, wings, dips, churros, etc. Some dishes were better than others (the fish was okay but the chicken was better). What was a standout was the service - we were a big group ordering lots of things but our server kept her cool and managed to keep everything straight. I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday.  Pros:  - Nice backyard patio - Fairly quick service (only 5 tables were seated though)  Cons: - Drinks were pricey for 150ml cups - Everything had wayyy too much salt in it. I assume the food was close to going bad so they salted it. We got food poisoning that night and we assume it was from the food."}
{"text":"Taco's were da bomb as expected. If they weren't they wouldn't last. Romantic and social setting."}
{"text":"A really fun and cozy place. I love the decor and the mural in the back is awesome! It really does feel like an authentic Mexican experience. Our server was so kind and came by many times to check up on us, and see if we needed anything. The food is decently priced and you get a fair amount. The waiting time wasn't long at all. I ordered the vegan option, so the mushroom tacos. It was satiating and delicious. At first glace, I was underwhelmed with the portion I got, expecting more, but prior to finishing, I was definitely full! So all in all, this is a great place to come with friends for an affordable dinner with a lovely setting! Thank you, Chula!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm, weather was sunny, hot, patio weather like.  Made no appointments as it was not busy when we arrived.  Called just in case to see if we needed to make an reservation but they said no need as it generally gets busy later in the evening, and they were right.  Once we sat there for a good 10 mins, we noticed people started to come in, one by one.    Server were alright, it would be nice if  they described which taco was which, as we ordered 3 different tacos and could barely tell the difference.    We got the churrizo corn dog as the appetizers, it was alright, kind of blend, the hint of spice was good.  The tomatoe/corn sauce on top was a good touch to compensate the blend taste.    We got 3 tacos, pulled pork, chicken, brisket.  I would say i was dissapointed,  tasted a bit blend as well.  I had high hopes for the taco wrap as the pictures on yelp made it look delicious, but tasted kind of like card board and tasted tough.  And I've had my fair share of real good tasting tacos.  Compared to when i went to dominican/cuba before.  I had high hopes itll somewhat taste the same or more or less at least a different twist.  And finally for drinks we got the carribana and the sunrise cocktail, did not end up finishing it but they were pretty good if you like the super boozy taste.  The carribana cocktail you can taste the hint of coconut and was a good level of sweetness, same goes with the sunrise.  It had a good puch taste and nice touch of slush ice for a hot sunny day.  Would i go back, probably not for a while."}
{"text":"It's been a while since a good Mexican restaurant opened near me, so when I heard about the positive buzz surrounding Chula I got pretty excited. (Meanwhile I'm still mourning the closure of The Willow near Broadview and Danforth...)  The back patio is super cute and worth the trip alone, but their food is delicious to boot! Prices are very reasonable, and both the tacos and corn were just bursting with flavour (seriously, try the corn - you won't regret it). My only critiques are that the tortillas are quite thin and delicate, so it broke while eating and turned into a hot mess (a tasty hot mess), and that the menu is a bit small (no mole dishes, sadly). But I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience I have had in Toronto in a very long time and I would attribute that to the horrible service from our waitress. It is mind-boggling that they would let this person work at this restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter. Sloppy all around. The tacos were pretty good at 3/5 and the cocktails were amateur. I feel this restaurant has a lot of potential but I surely won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome drinks! Patio is tres cute and the staff was very nice! Would go back for their ceviche and steak!"}
{"text":"The food I had was great. I wanted more, and I expected to come back. I'm surprised to read that some people were less enthused by their food.  It wasn't the best tacos I've ever head, but it was definitely above average, and I basically didn't have any complaints with the food.  The place was busy, noisy (because it was busy), there were a few mixups with the order and a server dropped a tray of drinks nearby, so it was a bit too chaotic. I hope that it will calm down a little and that the food consistency will settle in (since my food was great, and other people seem less enthused), and everyone will agree this is a nice place to go for drinks and food.  Give it a bit of time to find its rhythm, then give it a try."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and the restaurant was quite busy. I thought it was a bit odd that nobody greeted us at the door. Even the bartender who was about a metre away from the front door didn't make an effort of acknowledgement...   Finally, I walked up to the waitress who decided to help a party with a reservation before anybody else in line. She didn't seem pleased that I approached her in that way but how else would I know what the waiting time is until we could be seated? I was hungry, OK!  When I finally sat down, I could really appreciate the decor. Like others have noted, it's beautiful and cozy inside. The ambiance is great for date night.   Since I'm a vegetarian, my options are a bit limited. We got the tortilla chips and guacamole, which I found a bit too salty and too tart with lime juice. I really enjoyed the crispy zucchini tacos, but likewise found them a bit too salty. I was a bit surprised to find tacos are $5/6 a pop, even for vegetarian ones made of humble ingredients like zucchini or mushrooms.  Overall, a decent meal. I definitely agree with previous reviews that the service could be better and friendlier. Hopefully, they improve because I selfishly want a good Mexican place (with a good patio) in the east end!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  Went here thinking it's Mexican food so I should have a lot of options. Yeah, not so much. The items on their menu are not labelled with any gluten info so the waiter's suggestions were really helpful.   All of the seemingly gluten-free options that are fried, such as tortilla chips and the cornmeal crusted calamari, are contaminated as they are fried in the same vat as the wheat flour fried items. The tortillas for the tacos are made from corn while the burrito ones are made with wheat. About half of the tacos offered are not gluten-free (3 are wheat flour battered), including the chirizo (normally a gluten-free standard) because it is marinated in beer. Noooo! I ended up going with the pollo tacos and they were delicious. For reference, I have a gluten sensitivity and minor cross contamination (few crumbs) doesn't bother me severely. I had no reactions with this place, but I also actively avoided eating the fried items that I knew would be cross contaminated.   The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of less for the minimal gluten-free options is because the wait staff are super helpful and try their best to work with your allergies. Also the ambiance of the place is fantastic, especially their back patio, which is a must for summer days.   TL ;DR minimal GF options, great ambiance"}
{"text":"Beautiful heated patio. Underwhelming food. I came with some girlfriends on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was perfect to celebrate a birthday with great music and good energy on the patio. The food left much to be desired. I did appreciate that they were willing to make modifications to menu items. Overall, I didn't feel any items I tried were amazing or worth making a trip out to the east end. The biggest disappointment was that they didn't have churros (they have a churro sundae bowl but we just wanted regular churros and that dessert couldn't be modified)."}
{"text":"I am glad I went once but I don't necessarily need to go again.   PROS 1) Service was VERY attentive and friendly.  2) The ambiance was great - excellent vibe and could have hung out on the patio all day! 3) This is a great place to come for a fun night out.   CONS 1) It is overpriced for what it is. I felt I was paying for ambiance more than anything else.  2) Of the bunch of different tacos I tried (4 in total); they were similar in taste and not particularly distinct in flavour  3) Lacked authenticity and the menu items are a classic case of the gentrification of 'Mexican' food"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10 people and I really enjoyed the food.  However, what I didn't enjoy was the fact that even though I was 3rd to give my order,  I was last to be served, and had to flag the waiter down a few times to point out that I didn't get my Enchiladas yet.  I think somehow they forgot, but some people were finished their meal before I got mine.   Their Guacamole is excellent,  and so was the chicken enchilada.  I'd go again.  Friendly waiter & staff."}
{"text":"Loved the patio. Location is far from downtown but worth it. Reasonably priced drinks and food. The ceviche was differnt but really good. Chips and dip were all great.   Skip the crab taco, fried and you couldn't taste the crab much. Everything else was good. Service was slow but they had just opened a month before I went and they were VERY busy for a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"Chula is such a great addition to the east end! My husband and I came here for an early dinner, however it was so early that the place was dead, so we ended up getting the food to go. We'd definitely eat-in next time though, as the restaurant decor is awesome.   We got the Perro de Maiz (Chorizo Corn dogs), the Carnita taco, the Cangrejo de Concha Blanda taco (Soft shell crab), the Seta Picante taco (Grilled spicy mushroom), and the Cola de Langosta taco (Whole rock lobster tail). The food surpassed my expectations! The soft shell crab seemed to be a bit over-breaded, and that is probably the only one I wouldn't get again. My favourites were the Chorizo Corn dogs and the Lobster taco.   Even though we only got take out, everyone working there was super nice and friendly when we were waiting for our food at the bar.   I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is a place that deserves between 3.5 and 4 stars overall. The service is quick and friendly and the food that we tried can stand on it's own.   Formerly known as McGugan's, this place traded the whiskey for tequila, haggis balls for guacamole, and bangers & mash for tacos.  I met up with a friend at Chula on a Tuesday and there wasn't a big dinner rush which was fine by me.  While waiting for my friend, the server ever so smoothly offered me some guac and chips. The fresh home-style chips was nice and held up against the tart and creamy guac.  Their drink menu is quite expansive and we decided to start our night off with a margarita. They have some interesting margarita mixes and we chose one the humo grande (tequila and whiskey) and I recommended the mami chula (tequila and champagne) to my friend. They offer a pretty expansive beer and cocktail menu as well.  She really loved the bubbly champagne surprise in her margarita and I found the blend of tequila and whiskey was appropriate which did not lead to any bad decisions later in the night haha.  I was only feeling peckish so I ordered the Mexican street corn and the smoked Mexican wings. I found that the corn didn't live up to my expectations so probably recommend you have this during the height of corn season when the produce itself is better. I really enjoyed the smokey Mexican wings. It was a good portion of 5 whole wings (drumstick, wing, and tip) that were not breaded. Half of them came sauced with chipotle glaze while the other was a habanero citrus dry rub. Both offered toned down levels of heat from the normally fiery peppers. It really hit the spot.  My friend was pleasantly surprized by her chicken enchilada and didn't leave a single crumb on her plate.  We stayed to chat whilst enjoying our food and rink. The room buzz wasn't too loud and there isn't a need to shout or scream across the table to be heard on a weekday.  I think that Chula is a welcome addition to this Gerrard St. neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It's a nice addition to the neighbourhood. This location used to be a local pub that kind of lost its way, now Chula moved in. The food is good, I had the pork, rice, corn and bean dish. My partner had beef brisket burrito.  His dish was good, he loved it, mine na not so much, it was hearty but missing something and I think it was sour cream. They may want to offer that as a side or add it entirely. We also had drinks, I had 2 beer and my partner had a beer and a mojito. When we received the bill we were a bit taken back, $67.00  before tip. Considering the portion size and two drinks each that's pricey. I wish them well because I think they're on to something in the neighbourhood however I think their prices may eventually hurt their business. Give them a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and beautiful/heated back patio that is surprisingly spacious for the neighbourhood.   Cheap drinks (try the $5 Chula Lager brewed by Wellington) and great apps - we had the chips & dips, zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, chorizo and crispy avocado and all were very tasty with terrifically flavourful sauces.   Tacos were top notch - tortillas could have been a bit fresher but still kept together. Tried chicken, shrimp, beef and lobster. All great.   And the dessert - churo sundae - amazing A+ service as well"}
{"text":"I've this place! The food was excellent (tacos, rice bowls) and service was good. Atmosphere was great. Love the 2 level outdoor patio! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant kept popping up on BlogTO so I decided that I should check it out.  A new Mexican place with a 2 tier outdoor patio?  Sounds pretty good to me!     Definitey make reservations b/c as the new \"it\" place it gets PACKED.  We got a table for 2 outside on the first level patio.  The tables are tiny and squished together so you get to know your neighbours well.  In our case this was a good thing as we talked about the food with the couple beside us (who were just about to leave).  We ordered several tacos - a few each of the spicy mushroom, the shrimp and the chicken to share.  All in all they were ok but I felt they were lacking some acidity/zing to them.  They got a little soggy as well so a bit difficult to eat.  Nothing spectacular.  We also ordered the churros/ice cream on the advice of our table neighbours.  You can never go wrong with churros!  They were delicious but honestly it isn't hard to screw them up  I think the draw of this place is the outdoor patios.  On the first level, the middle of the restaurant has those lounge-y outdoor garden patio sets where you can sink back and relax with your drink.  Very nice place to chill - right by the tiki bar.  Yes they have a tiki bar.  It's all things kitsch with the décor.  The service is really friendly if a bit slow, but understandable as it was slammed that particular Saturday.    I might come back for some drinks but I think I'll pass on the food unless I'm super hungry."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance...disappointing meal.  Went there for a date-night with my boyfriend.  Atmosphere was vibrant and fun.  I would give this place 5-stars for décor, lighting, and music.  The dinner was just okay.  Presentation was very nice, however, the quality of the ingredients and texture of the food was lacking.  Enchiladas looked great, but they skimped on the chicken.  The calamari tasted very fishy.  The big disappointment was the churro sundae, which was raw inside.  I'd say to stick to this place for drinks, before heading somewhere else for your main meal."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Interior StreetArt in the city. Well done. One of the biggest reasons I went. The other is a new spot on the east side of town which seemed kinda fun.  I have to say after reading what everyone else has said. I can't say I disagree. I had high hopes for the food. It fell short on flavour.  We didn't even finish our ceviche which  I always do because  it's a go to fave for me.  We were seated in the second floor dining area. Same level as the patio so I had to check it out. It looks amazing. Maybe in the summer.   The service was sporadic. Present in the beginning but absent after the food was served. We waited forever for someone to come by to the point where we just flagged down another server to get our bill.  It's not a bad spot. It just had no standouts in terms of food. we ordered a variety of tacos to share too. The drinks - cocktails and beer - were okay. I'd say if they bumped up their food flavour game and worked a bit more on customer service this would be a solid spot.   It has a ton of potential. The interior design is incredibly inviting so I'm crossing my fingers."}
{"text":"Food was flavorful, I really liked the ceviche appetizer. I got the pork burrito bowl and it was pretty good. Cocktails are on the pricier side. I'd come back for drinks, especially during the summertime.  Service is a tad odd.. Didn't feel as warm nor welcoming. There were times where I felt like the waitress was giving off a bit of attitude. I'd recommend this spot if you're in the area and want to catch up or hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm so glad they're here. My father inlaw is not a salad person but he loved the kale salad, he even had second helpings. We ordered the zucchini, pollo, and spicy shrimp tacos,  calamari, and corn. Everything we had is excellent. The staff are friendly and attentive. The atmosphere inside and outside is great. Definitely 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went to this new Mexican place in the neighbourhood. I think it's a nice bit of diversity. Good choices of tacos and drinks to choose from."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I've had. All 4 of us loved the pork taco the best. The beef brisket and shrimp are decent too. I took 1 star off because the stale chips were guacamole dips. I'm also surprise they don't give free chips."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and amazing service. Was there for the Valentine's Day special and the tacos were great. Tried the chicken, pork, fish and zucchini. I'd definitely come back! Service was prompt and good. Churro dessert was also delicious."}
{"text":"Great patio seating! Located in...I think its called East York.  They have 2 upper floors for patio seating.  Cool spot if you're not looking to go downtown.  Loved their variety on the menu.  We had a business luncheon and ordered a few different types if tacos, a salad, chips, pico de gallo and guac.  I really liked the guac.  Tacos were soggy and falling apart tho with the liquid sitting on the platter.  Unfortunately I didn't have any drinks as it was a work meeting.  Maybe next time! Definitely gonna check out the dinner scene before i decide on my final 3 star rating of the place. Street parking (not really my liking)"}
{"text":"Husband I I attended on a Sunday Evening. We sat at the bar area, bartender served us I had a great Caribana Margerita it was super yummy. We had guac as a appitizer it was good as well.  We ordered an assortment of tacos , all were yummy but we ordered too many to finish and they were spicy .  Overall zucchini taco was our favourite.  Good quick service, cool atmosphere, great drinks, and yummy food.  Cant complain ....will return..."}
{"text":"So I checked out one of the new hot spots in Toronto.  Very cool little place with an inspiring new menu.  Some of the items are true winners.  The guacamole is first class, with the Cremoso Jalapeño cheese dip.  The tacos are also mostly good.  I could use a little more fish in the fish taco but all very tasty. I had the Rock Lobster, Fish, Beef, Chicken were all excellent.  Fried Avocado was not a winner for me.  The sweets are also very good.  Citrus Margarita bars was my favorite, and the Churros were good but the dough is to soft and is hard to dip into the sauces without breaking apart.  Great local gem.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends a couple of weeks back and we all fell in love with it.  Double rooftop patios is a HUGE plus.  Tequila bar equals double plus.  The food was delicious and appropriately priced.  The service was awesome (Gisele was our waitstaff's name).....very observant and quick.  If you are looking for a great night out this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Super disappointed to have had a bad experience during my first visit to Chula. I had seen the hype video on BlogTO, but it did not deliver. The patio was full when we arrived, so we took a seat near the front of the restaurant (not a problem). The server we were assigned was also the bartender so it took forever to get our orders. I had to get up from my seat and walk over to the bar to ask for cutlery and plates because the staff were too busy standing around and chatting with one another. Our 'server' didn't stop by once to ask how our meal was and we had to get up to request our bill. Food was pretty decent, but never again."}
{"text":"Food was filling despite small portions.  Staff was friendly, music was loud, parking on Gerrard was free after 4pm.  Was a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Service: friendly and attentive, no complain  Food: we got the Guacamole and chips, Camaron Picante (spicy shrimp) tacos, and Pescado Borracho (beer battered fish) tacos  Guacamole - I found it a bit off that the guacamole came in a darker green colour, and tasted a bit more sour than most guac I've had (too much lemon juice?), could it be the leftover of the day? Chips were nice and crispy tho!  Spicy Shrimp Tacos - I asked for the tacos without avocado crema because of lactose, and it still tasted great! The shrimps were well seasoned with a hint of spicy, but not too spicy to burn (somehow burned my ass the next day tho...). Also, every taco was filled with a generous amount of shrimps too, I definitely recommend!  Beer Battered Fish Tacos - the waitress recommended this to us and told us she had them for lunch, and they tasted great too! My friend also said these tacos had a very \"clean\" taste... not sure what that means, but sounds positive lol  Overall: They have indoor seatings and 2 patios (ground level and 2nd floor), definitely a great spot for some drinks and good food!"}
{"text":"Six of us came here for dinner the other night after seeing BlogTO's post about the cute new patio spot. Unfortunately, the lineup was out the door and so we did not get to sit on the patio (even after having made reservations prior).   Appetizers were yum but small, so we wish we had ordered 2 of everything. We ordered the zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, and chorizo corn dog. Ceviche has quite the kick so those who are afraid of spice, beware.  Tacos were small and lacked flavour. We had ordered the spicy butterflied shrimp, pork shoulder, beer battered fish, and soft shell crab. To be honest, they all tasted the same - nothing made them unique or independently flavoured. We actually had to ask ourselves which one we ate after finishing. Also, not sure if we were just unlucky but the soft shell crab one was really fishy and smelled like the ocean.  Desserts, we tried all 3. Churros sundae was probably my favourite of the night!! Other 2 were nothing to rave about.   Overall I'm glad I tried this place but I'd say it's overrated. I find the menu to be way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. For $5-$7 a taco, La Carnita is a way better taco joint. I probably will not return."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the vibes are bangin'! Good music and perfect ambiance for a Saturday night date or friendly taco eating session. My favourite thing here is the \"Tres Salsas\"- all of their dipping options are 10/10 - so good! I always order extra tortilla chips because they are very generous with their salsa portions. The tacos are solid - not exceptional but definitely very good. The Mexican corn was surprisingly tiny, and not worth it to me (however the plating was great and it makes for a good photo). Make sure to get a seat downstairs - the upstairs area is smaller and more private, but the air flow sucks and it feels very hot and stuffy."}
{"text":"1. I'm pretty sure the bartender forgot to put alcohol in my cocktail, it tasted like juice.  2. We asked to be moved several times because the AC was blowing so hard and switching tables didn't help. Our waitress also told us that they need to keep the temperature down because they get hot running around serving customers... umm what? The place wasn't busy, she wasn't running around, and also how do other places keep a comfortable temperature?"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday eve. A cute spot but was quite dead. Service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the red pepper bowl which was quite tasty. Full of guac, rice, beans, peppers, tortilla chips and more. My friend had the brisket and shrimp tacos and said both were quite meh, small and simple. I'm not sure I would go back because it's out of the way and there are much better Mexican spots in the city."}
{"text":"Pros -- The food was reasonably good. Their beef taco was well seasoned, butterfly shrimp, and pork shoulder were all decent. We also had the corn as an appetizer and that was good too. The guacamole is the kind you'd make at home.  Cons -- The service and cocktails left much to be desired. Let's start with the cocktails. The bartender was sniffing the drinks rather than tasting them while making them. This resulted in a very limey cocktail (the El Rey and the Humo Grande).   The service was patchy at best. We had to ask for hot sauce with our tacos (they were on some of the other tables) and even when the server brought them over, there was only one.   Will I go again? Probably not."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican restaurant I've been to in a long time. My boyfriend and I came to Chula a while ago, and it was not a good meal, atmosphere or service.   1. Turn the music down, your waitress should not have to ask your customer 4 times what they want.  2. Your portions are small, over priced, and over rated.  3. Your staff is rude, not helpful, and cannot take orders properly.  P.s. Bad mojitos."}
{"text":"I'm often skeptical of places that get so much hype, but Chula really delivered. We went in last night and were seated immediately. The server was really friendly, quick and professional. We wanted to try a few things, so we ended up with some fried cod tacos, tortillas and guac and the chorizo corndogs.   Everything was frankly way better than I expected (remember that aforementioned skepticism?). The guac was fresh, chunky and really dynamic, not to mention clearly made in house. The accompanying chips were tasty and grease free, which was nice. The fish tacos were really good, a bit busier than I usually like. I found the fish to be slightly overcooked; but seeing as I tend to prefer my proteins slightly under I assume this is me being picky, and not an actual reflection of the kitchen. But the best thing was the chorizo corn dog. I'm almost tempted to go back tonight and get another one! We even got the churro sundae and it was delicious! But I'm glad I shared; it was very sweet and rich!  The room was nice, the bar was cool and the mural was really pretty. The only thing that underwhelmed was the bathroom -waaay too small and cramped! But if that's the worst thing I can say, there's really no complaints."}
{"text":"And presto... the medium to crappy pub becomes a fun, happening Mexican place with great food and and good service.  Tacos, sangria, enchiladas... all Met or exceeded expectations, and came out lightening fast!  The patio is the place to be if you can get a seat.  Eat local, eat often and enjoy!"}
