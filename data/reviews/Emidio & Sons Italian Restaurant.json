{"text":"This pains me to write this since my family and I have enjoyed their pizza for years...... But it all started about 3 years ago. They started making changes. I always ordered a sheet pepperoni, small fett Alfredo and a calamari.  Their food has always been inconsistent. Sometimes it was fabulous-- other times not. Being a cook myself..... One must suggest-- a little seasoning goes A LONG WAY!!! Salting the Calamri as soon as they come out of the fryer..... Salt and pepper in the Alfredo sauce.  Easy breezy.  I've called a couple times to let them know I wasn't happy-- but they never seemed sincere about hearing it. It always sounded like I was bothering them.  Then the change happened. I dunno if it changed hands or family members--- but the food isn't the same. They completely changed the calamari. I don't know if they've bought prebreaded now but it's horrible.  The sauce on the pizza also tastes like it changed.  We regularly ordered pizzas from them too. At least once a week. But now we never do. Just a suggestion. LISTEN to the feedback your customers are giving!!!!! I actually am the head cook for a small restaurant and I take the good with the bad. Yes-- everyone is not always going to love your food no matter what---- but being consistently 'blah' is terrible for business.  Its such a shame too because I believe that every cook has a choice to care or not to care.  Evidently and sadly Emidios is more interested in the outside appearance-- rather than the heartbeat of the operation..... Meaning the food. Sorry :("}
{"text":"Emidio's is a sad, sad representation of Italian food, take-out or otherwise.  I ordered a medium pizza with several toppings, and somehow the crust was undercooked.  At the time, several other individuals ordered pizza and their pizzas were also undercooked and looked unappetizing.  Cheese and sauce leave A LOT to be desired.  I've had pizza from coast to coast, with some bad ones along the way, by Emidio's takes the cake.  I would've rather eaten a burrito from Chipotle infected with the norovirus.  It was THAT BAD.  They were also out of calamari and did not state that they were out of calamari until after I arrived after placing a take-out order.  Their substitute...garlic bread, that was almost as bad as the pizza.  Horrific food, terrible service.  I would rather starve to death then have to eat at Emidio's again.  If I could give no stars, I would."}
{"text":"Emidio's was great! My family and I recently moved to Akron and we've tried a few Italian restaurants in the area, Emidio's was/is the best so far. LOVED their gnocchi alfredo and their chicken alfredo pizza. The owner (forgot his name) was awesome. Very friendly and welcoming guy. The employees I've come in contact with so far, have been very nice as well. I wouldn't think twice about bringing my family back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday evening, with visiting out-of-town relatives.  Place was small but clean, food was good with large portions.  I had the lasagna w/ meat sauce, would definitely get it again, after i try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Easily best pizza in Akron and would compete in Northeast, OH as top tier. Have had my share from Angelo's to Momma Santas and this place stacks up."}
{"text":"Tonite was the last straw. I'm going to cut/paste an email I was going  to send the owner. It will explain all.  I chose to not send it, but to publish it instead. Just because as stated in a few other ppls reviews --- he gets so offensive over any sort of complaint. I didn't see how an email would change anything.   I just cannot believe what I've experienced at this local, \"supposed\" still family owned restaurant.  But here goes ..............  Hi I am writing in response to the horrible, unprofessionalism from you-- the manager that I received tonite after receiving an order that I didn't order.  If you are out of something -- first of all; don't play the blame game. I have owned 2 businesses-- one of which was a cafe/bakery. First off I apologize to you-- that this upset me so much--- something like this really shouldn't make me this mad, but I feel obligated to write and tell you how you made me feel. Not because I'm a woman-- lol---but because I have been a loyal customer up until fairly recently.   Allow me to elaborate. I come to Emidios because in my opinion-- you guys have THE BEST fettuccine Alfredo in the greater Akron area. I love the noodles. I love the sauce. The combination of the two are like heaven in your mouth. The way the cream separates from the butter is unforgettable. Yummo  ---it's absolutely delightful.   I would have totally been fine with an explanation (or phone call because the kid asked for my #).... To be told that you were out of the noodles.  I would have waited until another day and just Come back. No biggie. Your fettuccine alfredo is worth the wait.   What did in fact happen , was spaghetti was substituted, without any apology or admittance to the fact (or an offer to comp the next visit there)...  Which was what I would have done at my own business.  I bent over backwards for my clients and because of that I was very very busy.  That's all you would have had done.  Instead , when I call to address the fact I didn't get Fettucine---I get a kid telling me to bring the food back (who does that )???...and the manager telling me that he didn't know what the kids did. (But the kid apologized and said they were in fact OUT of the sheets of pasta tonite)... And then I will in turn get my money back.  Oh ok. So-- you made the error and then didn't want to admit it. And then I have to make the trip all over again to bring the wrong order that you so sneakily gave me??  I'm sorry but I feel like your establishment just isn't the same.   Back when my family was still all together we made your place a weekly trip... Sometimes twice a week. Something has happened over these past few years and I'm sorry to say that youve lost a customer.  You need a lesson in etiquette sir and how to treat your customers .... Who essentially ARE paying your bills.  Tracy   PS.... Oh and upon looking further into my meal... It appears that the Alfredo sauce was changed too??  Were you out of that as well?? Or have we changed ownership and completely redone the recipes?? What happened to the wonderful delishishness of the homemade Alfredo sauce???It appears it's jarred sauce now.  I promise I won't return now. I simply cannot believe that someone has the privilege to own and extensively renovate a business and then, to turn out food such as that?? It's a shame. Such a shame.  Well, I wish you the best. But I honestly don't see how you're going to survive. Unless we have a gold mine underneath that building of yours."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. First off they forgot my salad, then the Eggplant parmesan looked like it was from a frozen dinner box. The noodles tasted like over cooked watery noodles. The sauce was watery, and the eggplant looked like it was frozen. Tasted horrible, had to throw $30 in food away. I got 5 little jojos with cheese on them for $7. This place is really bad."}
{"text":"Husband: This is the place for pasta! Everything is homemade for real. Pasta is perfect AlDente. Alfredo sauce is very cheesy and dosent separate half way through the meal. I personally suggest asking for some of the spread they put on the bread for a lil kick of garlic! I special request everywhere. The Chef came to my table and helped me engineer just what I was after, and genuinely cared that I was satisfied with our compromise. You can't pay enough for service like that.  Wife: Skip Olive Garden...this place is the real deal! Outstanding service!! Spectacular homemade food! Yes HOMEMADE/HANDMADE!! I had the Chicken Parm. Chicken was tender, rigatoni noodles were cooked perfectly, meat sauce was the bomb!! Food is filling and actually have enough for another meal tomorrow. It takes a lot to impress us...they have exceeded our expectations!! Kudos!! My belly is so full I'm gonna sleep good tonight!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gold mine. They're open super late, so it's convenient for those who work late, go out for some fun or have the late night munchies. I usually order the chicken and jojo's and/or the antipasto salad. Their homemade dressing really sets this salad off. The same guy is usually there working in the evenings. He's always hustling and consistent with the food/service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner... very sad meal.  Cheese Sticks... metalic tasting triangles with no herbs  Beef and Cheddar Pizza... velveeta and tasteless meatballs so thick the center half was gummy and under cooked... even though the underside was brown.  Customer walked in to place a take out order... asked if the crab in the seafood anti pasta was real or fake...waitress had no idea... went a step further... said no one had ever asked before.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I really hoped for good pizza outta this place. I pass it a few times daily and yesterday decided to try it. Sadly I can't remember eating a pizza that tasted like nothing, as this did. Zero taste,  zilch... I don't think a spice was used in the sauce...bland tomato sauce at best, crust was soggy and undercooked, also tasteless dough, canned mushrooms with no taste , minimal pepperoni,  maybe they were getting low. It wasn't inedible just couldn't believe how devoid of flavor in anything.   For dessert , ordered a large 5 buck chocolate chip cookie. To my surprise,  also devoid of any taste,  how is that even possible?   To summarize,  nice little mom n pop place recently remodeled,  hoped to be a repeat customer, but any of the regular fast food pizza places are 100% better than the food I experienced here, and that is saying something because I would only eat at a papa Johns or pizza Hut if I was out of options."}
{"text":"Shout out to Emidios....my dad is in a nearby nursing home and loves fried chicken and jojos....he is unable to tear ketchup packets that normally comes with their dinners...so I've arranged for them to deliver him a chicken dinner every Tuesday for dinner...complete with ketchup in a cup!  Thank you for being so accommodating! !"}
{"text":"This was the first time we have eaten here.  The food was great and the service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Good food, great service!!! Great, homemade food and quaint dining.  Server was a sweetheart!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the lack of customer service here and the pricing structure ! $8.50 to deliver 2.7 miles ! Also I was informed that a half and half pizza is charged as two toppings ? Is that the new math half +half = 2 ? Employee on phone was very rude when explaining the prices . I got a simple \"fine\" when I canceled my sheet pizza order ."}
{"text":"We've had their pizza, carry out only but I have been wanting to try the sit down restaurant ever since they remodeled. I have lived in the area my whole life and I know that Emidios family has been in business for many years but after my recent visit I have no idea how. Everything we ate was obviously frozen, food service food and the saddest part of all was the sauce. How does an Itlalian family justify serving crappy canned sauce in a building with their name on it? All these years and no family recipe? The food was edible but NOTHING memorable here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Akron area and it is consistently good every time we visit. The drive through is very convenient.  They are also very supportive of schools in the area (ex. IHM) which says something about the ownership."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a really nice server. The bread and pasta and all the sauce is homemade plus when you get there brownies it's like half a cake. And it is a great places."}
{"text":"Went here to eat last Thursday night and we were the only people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the food was Luke warm at best. My wife had the wedding soup and the broth tasted like dishwater. Myself I had the calzone and it was under cooked doughy in the middle and soft outside. The sauce was good but it could not help this dying meal that started with calamari that was over cooked and more elasticity than a rubber band. I we were leaving another man walked in and I was very tempted to warn him before it was too late. Do not go here for Italian food. The service here is slow and rude. You can and will find a much better place. As far as I am concerned this place has no taste!"}
{"text":"I've been to this locations now a few times and have always had good service and great food. I have always thought their pizza is great. I didn't realize they had fresh pasta until we dined in and I'm glad we did. If you like good old fashioned Italian food, Emidio's is for you."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Emidio's tonight after another local business was closed. She said she wanted Italian, so we decided to give this a try. We were greeted with a warm welcome as soon as we walked in the door. She ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with crab & me the Pasta Rosa with crab, but first we had to try some calamari rings. They came out quickly with my salad & her soup. The marinara was very good. I'm usually not a big fan of it, but we pretty much licked the bowl clean of sauce. My salad was covered in freshly grated mozzarella, not the pre-grated crap you get in a bag. I had the house dressing which was great. She said her soup was really good but had wished for a little more pasta in it. Our dishes were brought out as soon as we finished our soup and salad. Both dishes were outstanding. I must warn that the crab is imitation which I didn't see mentioned on the menu. Didn't matter because it was still very tasty. Now came the shocking part. The pasta was fresh pasta. Omg, so good. What a huge difference from dried. Had I realized this before, I probably wouldn't have gone to most of the other Italian joints around town. Ok, I'm lying. I'd still try the others, but only for the sake of Yelp reviews. We were actually full before our main course came out but had to take a few bites just because. I will definitely be coming back to Emidio's. I wasn't a huge fan of Italian Cuisine until tonight."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken and the Italian sandwiches from here for my daughters graduation.  The Italian sandwiches were a big hit!  they were so good and great size for a party.  Would most certainly order from here again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever eaten in my life. Hands down, maybe a bow to the double cheese, double sauce. Please do not cut yourself short in life."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here! We were not sure what to expect from reading earlier reviews,  but we were pleased with our experience.   We both had the veal parm and it was great!  The house salad dressing,  which was a creamy Italian,  was killer,  too. And the meatballs (which we have to try at every Italian place) were also tasty.  The only thing I'd have liked was a wine list with more options. But if they don't sell a vast amount,  I can see why they keep it small.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love eating here, at least once every couple of months for the past six years.  What a huge disappointment our last visit was, and we won't go back.  It started with the dinner salad, it was half the size as before and just iceberg lettuce with two cherry tomatoes.   Then the waitress brought the bread basket.  It seriously tasted like nothing, zero flavor.   The entrees were not edible.  My chicken parm was really salty and so cold the cheese on top was not melted.   Mostly it was the salt content that made it not edible.   My husbands entree had ingredients that just did not seem fresh, and did not taste good at all.  I felt sorry for our waitress because she could tell from our untouched plates that we were not happy campers.  She was super sweet and attentive.   Somehow  this restaurant has managed to go down the tubes overnight!  They put so much work into redecorating the outside, what a shame!    It will be worth the few extra miles to drive to Dontinos from now on."}
