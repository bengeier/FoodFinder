{"text":"Boring, no drink selection only water and coke winter time they had better deals, now I don't think its worth to pay 10 bucks plus tax for a small cup of yogurt and the taste is so AVERAGE, they have got only  4-5 flavors to chose from, that watermelon taste sucks..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 2x in the last 2 weeks and it's just not very clean. Toppings all over the counter and floor. I've been on hot, hot days so it was *really* busy in there, and I guess with constant traffic, it's hard to keep it pristine. They've got a wide array of topping choices and frozen yogurt choices, my favorite yogurt being the peanut butter and the plain Greek yogurt. Just watch how much you pile on, the weight adds up quickly!"}
{"text":"Pricey but you get what you pay for and it's worth it! Great variety of Frozen Yogurts and even Sobert. Lots of great toppings as well. If it's your first time to a self-serve frozen yogurt place, I'd recommend not filling up your cup all the way or else expect a $10+ bill!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous menchies in the GTA and I have got to say, this one is the best and cleanest one. They have at least 4 times more toppings than any other menchies! They have absolutely every topping you can imagine. There tables, counters and machines are clean and the store is at least 2/3 full whenever I have gone. It seems like this owner knows what they are doing and cares about there company compared to the other owners. I wish the menchies close to me were at least half as good as this menchies."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, good selection of toppings and the place always seems pretty clean, considering the amount of sticky little munchkins running through the joint.  It's a favourite of my five-year-old.  The d√©cor is a little blah and the music a bit loud, but otherwise great."}
{"text":"This is my first 1 star review. I was excited to try menchies, it seemed right up my alley. This place was empty (Monday at 6pm) and absolutely filthy. Garbage on the floor and looked like it had never been cleaned more than a sweeping every now and again. Toppings were stale (especially the chocolate covered raisins).  Honestly, if you have a big group a kids and want a place to set them loose without judgement, I'd say this is your place (if you can look beyond the filth). If you don't fit into that group I'd say do not go here under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Brilliant place. You choose your yogurt and how much you want (mix flavours too, its a good idea) and then you choose from a huge range of toppings. Its great! The toppings are amazing, but I found that once I found my combo that's what I stuck with.  I love this Menchies. The owners are super nice people, and the staff are always pleasant. They do a great job keeping the place clean too, especially when you consider how many rampaging kids are in there each day.   Do yourself a favour and stop by.  On a hot day, Menchies just can't be beaten. Even on a cold day its great! I cannot lie, Menchies is so tasty its been dinner more times than is sane for a grown man. I blame the Fiancee. Definitely her fault."}
{"text":"Excellent prices and tons of choices for flavours & toppings!  I will definitely be frequenting this place this summer!!!  They give you a points card for free also and you can get free yogurt on your birthday and other goodies!!"}
{"text":"It's too sweet. All the ice creams, and all the condiments too.  I've had ice cream at other places before - AYCE restaurants, McDonald's, and gelato shops. I found Menchie's to be way too sweet by comparison. It didn't appeal to my taste and I won't come back. Perhaps it appeals to others, I can't say.  On the plus side, I liked the self-serve make-your-own-mix system, the shop was clean, brightly lit, and appropriately decorated."}
{"text":"Probably the best frozen yogurt shop in Toronto. They have a good variety of flavours that are nor conventional and are better than many ice cream shops I have tasted; like red velvet, cake batter, cotton candy..."}
{"text":"Been to various frozen yogurt places and this is the first time I've actually been disappointed.  First the good -- the place is nicely decorated, was relatively clean, and had great flavors of yogurt.  The toppings were varied.  Now the problem: a few of the toppings were incredibly stale.  The worker seemed to not care when I informed him of at least one putrid item.   Ended up not finishing my ice cream and throwing it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, it is all self serve with every flavor and topping imaginable, you put your creation together and pay by weight, a must try for the ice cream lover!!"}
{"text":"What pulled me towards this yogurt shop was their cute logo and choice of colours. Anything with happy faces and pink will have my full attention.  The difference between Menchie's and other frozen yogurt shops is that you get to make your own creation, it's like a buffet. There are many flavours that you can select from, ranging anywhere from red velvet to cookies and cream. There's a long list of flavours on their website but the shop doesn't carry all of the listed flavours. After filling your cup up with your favourite yogurt, you move forward to the toppings counter. There are soooo many toppings to choose from, the majority are candy and the rest are fruits. After making your delicious creation, you head over to pay by placing your cup onto the scale. The more heavier your creation is, the more expensive it'll be.   I got a frozen strawberry vanilla yogurt topped off with strawberries and chocolate chips. I didn't even buy a lot and it cost me almost $6, which is pretty expensive for yogurt. I would've given Menchie's full stars but the price got to me.  There's plenty of seating available inside and they also have a patio out in front for the summer time.  This place is great! I wish they would open up a shop in Mississauga but the closest one coming soon is in Brampton."}
{"text":"Like the yogurt but showed up at 9pm tonight an hour before close and it was closed... Disappointing."}
{"text":"Frozen yogurt sold by the weight. This is how all food should be sold. I get to choose how much I want and I pay for it. Menchies charges .55/oz for its frozen yogurt and wide range of toppings.   There are usually 12 to 14 flavours but vegans be warned: there is usually only one sorbet there and I've yet to see it be anything but Honey Dew Melon. On the plus side this is an awesome flavour but other frozen yogurt outfits often carry more for you omnivores+.  You can add a waffle to your cup for $1. Do no do this. The waffle tastes about as special as a Tuesday afternoon and it only serves to take up room in your cup meaning less opportunity to fill your cup with different flavours.  The topping bar offers everything from nickel candy through fruit and sauces.   If you have a bucket list add this: Menchies peanut butter frozen yogurt with peanut butter sauce. It is AMAZE!!!!!!!1!!!!1!!! You will die happy. This will probably also help you die sooner but if you're buying frozen yogurt by the pound then you're getting what you pay for (see what I did there?)  TO SUM IT UP: A free market approach to frozen yogurt you're sure to delight in, unless you're a vegan that doesn't absolutely adore honey dew melon."}
{"text":"Cheapskates selling kosher junk... hmmm.  So you walk in the door and are immediately bombarded with photos of the most en vogue celebrities enjoying this 'tasty treat', you immediately begin to believe that if all these hot celebrities like it, then this has got to be AWESOME! And if you're into being sold kosher, diet, food, by the weight - which is like another thinly veiled jab to insinuate that you need to be dieting or something, then yeah, this place just might be for you. But if you're into paying a flat rate for thick, rich, creamy, real, ice cream which is freely and generously piled onto the cone, then go somewhere else. Anywhere else. I kind of wonder if they just shoved this junk into the celebrities' hands and then snapped a photo before they could throw it away. Either that or celebrities would rather be eating normal ice cream but can't because they have to be stick-thin to keep getting contracts for gigs or whatever.  I just can't think why any normal person would eat this. I can definitely see how it could help you lose weight since if this is all you can eat when you're dieting, then it makes more sense to just give it up and starve yourself. Ugh. So yeah, clearly I'm not a fan, wish I could give it zero stars."}
