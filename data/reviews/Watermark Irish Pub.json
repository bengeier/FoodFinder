{"text":"I can't say that this place is anything special. I came here mainly because the city felt like it was closing in on me, and I needed a nice spot by the water to relax by.   Had a pint of Sommersby and their 3 Dips & Chips appetizer, which was pretty decent. Though it was only a simple order. I would have had more, had the waitress come over again. I didn't see her at all after everything came."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is really surprising. In a good way traditional but original, hearty and healthy. My favorite is the Angus Burger served with a very good house salad. If you prefer chips, they have also very good one. But the powerful taste of the Burger mixed with the really subtle one of the Salad is quite a treat. Then there is the environnement. The lake, first. Everything in Toronto is better by the lake. People are warmer and funnier (they even have long dinner at 9 pm, et oui!) We were sitting there with my wife when this couple gave us an almost full bottle of wine because they had to leave and the server immediatly brought us glasses before we had the time to ask. Speaking of the server, one might find offensive their really mini-skirt and tight shirt with all you can see cleavage but, sorry, as a frenchman this even added to the quality of the experience especially since the girls working here are beautiful, smiling and apparently happy to be there."}
{"text":"We came here after walking out of the Amsterdam Brewhouse down the way and were instantly much more impressed. Great service - had water right after sitting down, our server came to take our drinks order right away and was very attentive, and our food came out crazy fast.  We just had burgers (the Irish fare sounded tasty, but it was way too hot out to be eating stew the day we were there, in my opinion), which were thick and juicy. We swapped out salads for the fries and appreciated the various salad options available.  Attentive, quick service and tasty burgers with a great view. A little bit on the pricey side, but you're paying for location in a place like this."}
{"text":"Such A Shame! So sad that somewhere with such a great location always seems to drop the ball.  If you are going for food you need to realize they share a kitchen with the restaurant next door a lot of items are made in bulk (as I found out with our brunch eggs Benedict and eggs) Service is horrible.  Only once while sitting at the outdoor bar have I had good service.  One visit we were actual forgotten.  Empty plates in front of us for 40 minutes no server in sight had to literally hunt her down and when she brings the bill no explanation.  They really need to get their act together because there is potential."}
{"text":"Guiness was poured well and the pub food was good. I tried the Rogan Josh and it was good. Just needed a little Tabasco but then everything tastes better with Tabasco."}
{"text":"Sad to say I have been to this pub almost ten times and only once (St. Patrick's Day) I have had service. The patio has a beautiful view and would be great on a summer day if you could get just a little bit of service. Don't plan on coming here if you want to be in and out in under an hour; a quick drink doesn't exist.   Don't be a fool like me and keep going. The service will never get better!"}
{"text":"Meh...  Went last night, our initial server was fabulous and so friendly and helpful especially when we were a group of 20.  Menu is typical for an Irish Pub. I had their Beet salad and added a piece of Salmon; it tasted OK. Desserts were standard. No one else seemed to rave about their food, but I didn't hear any major complaints either. (unfortunately I had an upset stomach when I got home).  Disappointed they didn't have Strongbow. If you order a Caeser, make sure you ask for spicy - it isn't actually spicy but without the horseradish, it's bland. And don't depend on their white wine list. They didn't have half of the wines in stock."}
{"text":"Worst veggie burger I've had in my entire life.  Only offering one vegetarian option is fine.  I'm used to going out and have only a veggie burger to choose from but it needs to be at least edible.  This was the most embarrassing excuse for a veggie burger that I have ever seen.  For 14$ I'd expect at least one person who works there to taste it and give some feedback.  Pull this off the menu and tell vegetarians to stay away.  I hate to give such a poor review based on one menu item but it was my only choice and you chose to sell it.    Yuk.  Find a better place, there are many around."}
{"text":"Great location on the waterfront.   The food was good. They have a great veggie burger.   My wife loved the fish and chips. The best she's had since we were in London"}
{"text":"We met up with a group a of people who were having drinks on the patio last night. Our server was nice and was helpful. When I paid my bill, she explained that gratuity was included- which was a good thing because I paid $28 for a single pitcher of beer. She told me that Igor would be our new server because her shift was done. When Igor came to our table, I still had a full pint and he told us we had 7 minutes to finish up. When he came back a couple minutes later, he tried to grab the pint out of my hand. I asked him to let go, as he tried to wrestle it from me. He insisted that I let go, and I insisted that he unhand me. I told him if he has an issue he should inform security and to keep his hands off of me. After quite a struggle, he let me go and I gave him the beer. Another employee apologized, but you probably won't see me at this establishment again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice considering this is on the lake but the food is always....just ok.  I want to love it but feel like they can do so much better.  The staff is always pleasant which helps but if they ramped up their food quality they would get more of us locals."}
{"text":"This is an anchor location in a highly visible, tourist heavy part of one of the greatest city's on earth.  Why don't we have one of our hundreds of high quality, tasty, classy and sexy restaurants occupying this space? It's so shameful, to have a restaurant like this in such a prime corner of the city... Just sitting there, like a little cash cow that I am sure that it is... I would have paid double my bill to have a better experience... Higher quality staff... Better food... Cleaner environment... If I could give this place 0 stars, I would... Shame on them... There is nothing more disgusting than a restaurant that clearly takes advantage of a 'captive audience', by under servicing them and reducing the quality of their food and services to the bare minimum.  The thinking is, where else will they go?  Truth is Toronto has some of the best food options (from all over the world) to choose from and I encourage travelers to the city and locals to dig a little deeper... You may have to take a quick cab, but it can absolutely be worth it.  Until something changes here, my family will go eat something epic in the city and then head down to Queens Quay for the day.  It's the best plan.... So many great choices along King/Queen/College/Yonge... I wouldn't waste my money or time on more than a couple of drinks at this place..."}
{"text":"This place was so unmemorable that I didn't even remember the name until I stumbled upon some pictures while searching for good eats at the Harbourfront.  I went there on a blind date - not wanting to seem like a picky eater, I quickly settled on Watermark after a walk along the harbour figuring that you can't go wrong with pub food. Ultimately, this was true - I can't complain about the food but it was definitely nothing to write home about either.  It was a Sunday night in early July so there was quite a large crowd clamouring for a seat on the patio. We decided to wait at the bar which was so crowded that it was almost impossible to find a space to order a drink. My date didn't have any cash on him either at which point I quietly expressed that I'm an indoors kind of gal so sitting inside was just fine by me. We were seated almost immediately. I wasn't too thrilled though - the tables are arranged in a very haphazard way and the space was quite dark. It definitely looked like there were some not-so-clean patches on the seats and floor. Again, not wanting to seem picky and demanding, I put aside my mildly-OCD tendencies and had a seat.  We got the calamari to start (he chose, I'm not really one for calamari at a pub) and both got the buffalo chicken tenders with blue cheese dip and Yukon potato fries. The calamari came out fast enough and was a huge portion - great for sharing. Then began the waiting portion of the meal - good thing we were able to carry on a conversation easily as we waited and waited .. and waited some more. My date politely asked the waiter when we could expect our food. It came out shortly after. It was fine. Nothing wrong with it - satisfactory chicken fingers, satisfactory portion, good dip.  All in all, an average pub with slightly-above-average prices due to location."}
{"text":"I came here near the end of last summer, and I must say that the food wasn't the best I had. I ordered a burger that was dry and completely flavorless. It was as if they pressed minced meat, put it on the grill, put the patty in between two stale buns, slathered some ketchup on it, and voila!  A restaurant in such a lovely location with such a spectacular view should have food that accompanies the senses.  Mind you, I haven't tried all their food, so the rest of the menu could be better!"}
{"text":"Location..great. Service is OK. Server was quick to bring menu and water. Ordered chicken tenders and pasta for kids. Server came back saying they ran out of pasta. Fine. Grilled cheese then. Drinks? 1 apple juice and 1 orange juice. Server came back 1 minute later...\"Sorry! Out of OJ!\" Okaaaaaay...2 apple juice then.  Hubby wanted wings and me..fish and chips. Guess what happen 2 minutes later? Server came back and told us that they're out of wings! Fineeeeeeee...fish taco! Few minutes later...server came back looking embarrassed....Without saying a word, we got up and left. She did say \"Have a great evening!\" as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Before coming here to dine with a group of ppl for a farewell party for someone leaving the country, I didn't realize the review for this place was not that great.  We were sitting outside the restaurant area where its a bit more quieter and the server brought us all ice water. I did realize that once we ordered food it did take over 40 mins for the food to come, but we were all conversing that it was okay.   I ordered their fish and chips (upsize chips to poutine) for $2 extra. Their poutine is the usual but use alfredo sauce mixed with gravy and cheese curd. The fish was a good size piece, and the batter was alright, but not the greatest fish and chips I had.  My gf had their famous 'Guinness Steak and Mushroom Pot Pie'! It comes with peas and yukon fries. I tried the pie, and it was not bad for bar pub food, but AGAIN not the greatest pie I've had.  Our server would come by every 20+ mins to see if everything was okay. IN the end, our server gave us all separate bills and auto grat 15% tips add-on, so with our party made at least $50+ tips for not really having to do much to earn it.  This place has nice location, but I dunno if i would go back."}
{"text":"Totally understand why reviews are generally lackluster for this place. Nice patios, great location, decent atmosphere, decent service... But food is a half step up from McDonald's, bleck"}
{"text":"Blah.  Just went on a date here, and... not so great.  First off, the server didn't give me a drink menu until I specifically asked, (Apparently, \"I'll start with water,\" wasn't clear enough to indicate that I just wanted water while I decided what I wanted.)  The crappy loud pop music blasted over the speakers drowned out our conversation, and the food took forever to come out.    We ordered nachos but didn't want to get anything else because it was quite overpriced, even for the location ($18 for nachos with guacamole - no meat, chicken, etc.).  Overall, the menu selection was pathetic, and the food took forever to come out.  Although it was Saturday night, the place wasn't particularly full - maybe 20-30% capacity.    My Chocolate Martini tasted good, but the presentation - in an average looking lowball glass - was pathetic.     The waitress was not very friendly at all.  I get it - it's Saturday night, and she's probably tired - but no need to treat me like a dumbass for wanting more water.   The location, with the view of the harbour, was somewhat of a redeeming factor, but overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I went on a lunch date with my sister and friend and it was horrible. The hostess came in and never introduced herself and just gave us the silent treatment  We asked for a table of three and she just pointed her fingers and brought us to our table.   Next was the smoke in the restaurant was horrible and couldn't  breathe in their l. Service sucked  and never going back again"}
{"text":"I went to Watermark on a Monday night for a nice meal. The place has a great vibe, very relaxed. They had a lot of options on tap and Monday was also Martini Mondays. I had a strawberry spinach salad, which really good - had berries, goat cheese, nuts and a grape seed oil vinaigrette. For vegetarians there are only two options (salad or a vegetable sandwich). My friend had a burger, which was massive and we shared an order of sweet potato fries (good, but a little thin and crispy). The view is lovely and the menu is much cheaper than the over-priced Italian food next door. It's a great spot for a few drinks and a casual meal. If you get there before 6 on Monday, you can get 5 appetizers for $5!   PS The servers do wear kilts, but they're not THAT short - I definitely wouldn't compare to Hooters....."}
{"text":"Attracted by the location, and regretted being here!  The food was unexpectedly slow, just realized it's not a one night problem.  They have to make some improvements if they want to continue running this business!   Over an hour wait for the food, it's disappointing. I ordered the wings, they said 1 lb, I got 8 tiny dried wings.  I picked dry rub, I asked in advance if it will just be pepper and salt on top, the waitress said no it's Cajun rub, but when it arrived it's no Cajun, just salt and pepper which is what I didn't want.  But should I say anything I won't get to eat dinner that night.   Will never come back.  Rather go upstairs to Pearl the Chinese restaurant, food and service are much much better than this!   If you really want the patio, bring your own food, it will be much better than this place!"}
{"text":"Service and food sucks!    What an awful place!  The patio was a filthy dump, the plates were dirty, the $16 salad looked like pig feed with the driest chicken breast ever, the server thinks he is too good to be a server.  I can't believe this bar can get away with this kind of service, food and attitude.  Hope it goes out of business soon!"}
{"text":"This is only receiving 2 stars from me because my caesar salad (without the chicken) was actually enjoyable however my overall food experience was very disappointing.  The location was ideal as my date and I were looking for somewhere to eat that was close to where we were going. There are nice views and a lovely outdoor patio which I presume attracts its customers but the food quality and portion sizes fall way below expectations.  I came here for the wings which I quickly found out they sold out of on the day before...that was my first disappoint. I ordered a caesar salad instead and added chicken (which I had to pay an extra $5 for) when it arrived I had literally a children's size portion of chicken and it was cut into 3 tiny strips - I wish I took a picture. It was cajun style chicken that was overcooked and extremely dry.  I promptly told my waitress and received an appropriate size of chicken for the cost... When my chicken came it was still dry and lacked flavor. Looking over at my date's meal, he ordered a fried chicken sandwich which came with a hard rock bun. You can tell it was clearly left out all day. We called over the manager who even agreed with us about how much the food sucks and said himself that you pay for the view when you eat there. What manager says that about the company he works for?!   Overall, I will not be returning here. I highly recommend people find somewhere else to eat as the food is horribly made - and even when it's returned to be made again it's still pretty bad."}
{"text":"Ordered food through Foodora, got an email 45 minutes later from the food delivery company advising Watermark refused my order because they were to busy...how am I any different than someone that walked through the door...brutal"}
{"text":"Prefer this spot for lazy afternoons on the water to enjoy summer, watch families and tourists enjoy my city. Get your friends, a couple of share plates and a beer. Then chillax people!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! It took around an 40 minutes for anyone to serve us then a further hour for the food to arrive. The server apologized but didn't seem to massively care that we'd been waiting. Tables who had arrived after us finished and left before our order was even taken. Then when our food did arrive it was lukewarm! If I'm paying $10 for a plate of fries, I'd expect them to at least be hot.   This place just ruined the end of a lovely Canada Day :("}
{"text":"This pub is geared towards the summer tourist crowd which means in the fall and through winter the service level drops to almost nothing.  They hire untrained staff for both waiting and the kitchen.  I would wait until next summer before you plan a visit."}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time at this restaurant, both times for breakfast / brunch and both times I experienced the same problem with slow and rude customer service.  Based on the reviews I see here, it doesn't look like it was a case of bad luck for me.  Last year, when we came, the waitress was slow in seating us, bringing out our beverages, taking our orders and serving our orders. She actually had the decency to slam the water glasses on the table.  There was next to no one on the patio and yet, we were ignored while all the waitresses socialized with each other at the bar.  Asked to speak to the manager and he didn't care too much about the situation.    Came back here again this year because we were staying at the Radisson Admiral and it was one of the closest places to grab breakfast.  Once again, there were only a handful of occupied tables on the patio.  Our waitress came us 2 pitchers of water immediately but did not return with cups until 15 minutes later.  She took drink orders one at a time and did not return with them until 5 minutes later.  They were on a reduced menu and offered only 3 items for breakfast - 1 of which were belgian waffles.  We ordered the belgian waffles and then were told that they had run out.  Most of us ordered the same dish (bacon, sausages, eggs) given the limited choices.  Our food came about 1 hour later!!! I can understand 1 hour if I was asking for a more creative and extravagant dish.  However, 1 hour to make eggs, sausages and toast is ridiculous.  Not only, we saw guests who arrived after us order, eat and leave before everyone at our table had their meals!  Of the 2 hours spent at the restaurant, I'm confident in saying that I spent 1 hour looking at the bar waiting to be acknowledged by the waitstaff.      Extremely frustrated, I asked to speak to the manager and at least he seemed to care enough to offer us a discount on our bill in exchange for the \"inconvenience\".  To be honest, I don't care for the discount because my time is worth more than the couple of dollars that he took off the bill - I just wanted to make sure that he received feedback that the level of customer service or lack thereof was utterly disgusting.  In a profession where 18% gratuity is becoming the standard, I expect better.  The average person who works has performance reviews and only receive bonus and raises if their performance meets or exceeds expectations so why should waiters and waitresses be any different?"}
{"text":"Good food and great location. Would probably be better to come over the summer to enjoy the view and the pool.   Of all the dishes we ordered, probably dessert was the best! I would give the dessert a 4 star rating. Otherwise in terms of just food it's more like 3 star."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Waited around at our table for over ten minutes while servers wandered around in no rush. Weren't even busy. Gave up and left."}
{"text":"It is a waterfront restaurant, so expect it to be expensive for the scenery.  Also for any city that a restaurant offers a scenery, don't expect the food to be superb.  Grilled Chicken Club House with crispy bacon / lettuce / tomatoes / pesto mayo / ancient grains bread which tastes really good and I like the claimed fresh hand cut fries.   The Lobster pasta is creamy and lots of lobster meat, looks really good Prosciutto pizza - I like the Italian ham alone better than on a pizza Mushroom pizza - salty Bruschetta with tomato concasse and shredded beet on thin slices of bread is special with the beet  Overall it is very expensive for a lunch to enjoy outdoor with the lakefront."}
{"text":"We are party for 4, was there on Saturday late afternoon to mid evening and the place are pretty death, cause is winter... Well the service was fine but the food is big disaster. We order Shepperd Pie, Fried Calamari and Fried Shortribs. The Shepperd Pie end up looks like a Sheep diarrhea on a left over mashed potato from a week ago, Fried Calamari like a already chew bubble gums boiled in a cornmeal and the Shortribs like left over bone from my dog. Luckily the drinks come out as it should be. I suggest they should closed down the kitchen and do rehiring for the new culinary team that can cook not a Joker! 2 star for the drinks and service."}
{"text":"The location is nice, especially in the summer time when the very large patio area is open.  I agree with the others that the girls in short skirts was a little off... even unnecessary.    I remember the food being good, but I honestly can't remember what I had now so I guess it was unremarkable too.  The thing I most remember is the giant glass of Hoegaarden... it seems they like to serve it in a glass bigger than your head.  All of the other beers on tap were served in reasonable sized glasses."}
{"text":"Ruined my night!   Unlike others on this board, I am not a foodie. I am just a regular married guy who enjoys eating. Visited on a week-night with my partner for a nice night by the water, and I have been on a diet for 3 mos, so the homemade ice cream shop by Queen's Quay was on my mind. Il Fornello is a usually a lock, but had a 40min wait (inside and patio) so decided to give the neighbour Watermark a chance. As well, no patio seat, but was seated inside right away. Service appeared quick, drinks brought quickly, and order placed quickly....then the wait... took 1 hr to cook a burger and club sandwich. Food was just okay, and I understand that primo location will charge $13 for a hamburger, I was okay with all that...in the end, the wait was so long that the ice cream shop closed. I had a feeling the staff were prioritizing the patio clientele? Not sure. But with all the other options even within a 3-5min taxi ride, I won't be going back to Watermark, esp when what you pay for (having a cold beer and pub food right by the water) is not a for sure."}
{"text":"Saw a performance at the Fleck Theatre so stopped in with a group of 8 for some food around 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  They seemed really busy and what also became apparent fairly quickly was how unorganized the service was.  It seemed to take forever for our drinks to arrive and when they did they were all staggered, with people who ordered 10 mins after the first orders receiving their drinks before the initial people ordered.  Our original server went MIA for a bit and we were given someone else who in my opinion was a lot more pleasant than she was as she was obviously flustered and seemed overwhelmed.  I did see a notice up for a job fair so perhaps they are extremely short staffed which would explain some of the terribly slow service.  I ordered the Guinness burger which I don't think was anything to write home about other than the price lol.  It was about $18 and of substantial size, but the fries were sort of soggy and covered in grease.  I realize that fries are deep fried, but I like my fries to appear as though someone has attempted to de-oil them a bit.  Regular pub fare with mediocre service, I really don't see a reason to ever come back here."}
{"text":"In my office we say that Watermark is short for Water mark-up. Extremely overpriced, you are paying for the view of the lake (which is actually quite nice to be fair). The food is pretty bland and the menu is boring. The Cardinal sin they commit though is serving 14oz glasses of beer at very close to pint prices. Skip this place and walk a little bit further west on queens quay for some (slightly) better options. Unfortunately it seems restaurants/bars think the view of the water exempts them from maintaining quality."}
{"text":"Pretty good pub.  I am a downtowner myself, so I would say I have been here quasi regularly.  Good atmosphere.  Great location for me.  I like it.  Best are Halibut fish and chips, and Mississippi Flyer.    Summers are nice here, you do get Harbourfront, and some water.  Yes, there is a large boat docked out front, but you are not exactly in the Carribean, this is LAKE ONTARIO dammit!!!  Outside seating in the summer can be difficult, because this is when all the 905'ers come in.  Service can be either fantastic, or every 5th time I would say, really slow.  Massive operation, so, kinda happens sometimes the place is disorganized.  Phil behind the bar is great.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Location! Location! Location! Tourist Trap!  This place thrives and still exists because of it's location to the harbor. There is really nothing to say about this place. Take the most average service, combine it with pre-frozen dishes, and add a dash of predictability and you have Watermark: the most generic forgettable pub/restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Just a restaurant by the lake which is nice. Came by for a drink with a friend while enjoying the weather and beautiful view. The server was great, came by to check in on us despite being super busy. Will come back to try their foods in the future."}
{"text":"not sure what the negative reviews are all about, i've been here 3 times, it was right on for what I expected based on look, location, price, etc. nothing fantastic but i've never had any of the issues anyone here seems to be talking about, and the food was always warm and the brew was always cold... then again i've never gone on a crowded day...  at any rate, it's fine."}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food came out fast despite many of the previous reviews. My only complaint was that the sour cream is drizzled all over the nachos. Nice place to grab a drink with a view and people watch. A mix of tourists and people who work in the area. Portions were small given the price and inconsistent with sizes seen in the past."}
{"text":"First of all, if you want to drink and be around friendly staff, this place is great.   BUT, I live across the street at a harbourfront condo and let me tell you, some of the food experiences here are like they have 14 year olds in the kitchen.  Example CONS: - Sunday Brunch, my girlfriend's eggs benedict had no yolk! They were overcooked. - The previous Lobster Club on the menu had to be one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. - Under and Overcooked Burgers. They go from red/pink to hockey pucks, I guess it depends on the attention span or anxiousness of the cook?  This food doesn't even compare at all to it's chain of restaurants from Brazen Head to the others.   Such a poor food experience for such a great tourist location. Step it up.  Chris @ Queens Quay"}
{"text":"Slow,  oh so slow. Mediocre food. Did we say slow already?  And bad service.  Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Keep in mind its location. It is right on the water and you pay for rent. People watching is at its best here, of coarse if you're out on the patio. Food is ok at best. Keep the expensive liquor flowing and the experience gets better and better. As an added bonus, the pigeons have no fear..."}
{"text":"The patio is amazing, next to the water!! Great place for a date. The live music was really nice and constantly alternating singers .  Food wise, \"the chop\" is hands down the best salad I have ever had in my life! Bacon, goat cheese , avocado , salsa and greens made the best combination ever. Their chicken wings are also very good."}
{"text":"We have been at this pub before and we liked the location so decided to come back, but since it was a saturday night there was a wait so I put my name on the waiting list and I was told that the waiting for the table is 20mins and then once we get a table its gonna be another 20mins to order and then to get the food is another 40mins. So we were ok with it as we can order some drinks while waiting and we already had planned of going to this pub, take note we were only 4 people.   So after 15-20 mins we got a message saying we have been removed from the waiting list, so we walked towards the pub to ask the hostess ;who is by the way is not so sure of what she is doing, to ask if the table is ready. So she tells me \"I thought you got a table already\"; so I told her that we just got a message so we just came back. And then she tells me its because the kitchen is close already. So I told her the whole story of how she told me what the waiting time is and we agreed to wait; but then she just gave me this stare and replies \"sorry the kitchen is closed\".   So first of all why would you write my name on the waiting list and then tell us the kitchen is close and why would she assume that we got our table already cause I thought that was her job. So after seeing her i-dont-know-what-to-say look. I just said that's fine and we left. My friends wanted to talk to the manager but we decided  not to as it will not make our day any better after all that, we were just gonna beg for a table which I think should not be the case.  Anyways, might not come back or I just hope its gonna be better this time. If you cannot accommodate customers don't waste their time."}
{"text":"Awful service. How does this place stay in business?    We were seated by a server who really didn't seem to care, but that was okay because we sat at a great table in the sun.  At least she provided us menus.  After that, everything spiralled downwards.    We were ready to order drinks and appetizers.  No server in sight.  We flagged the hostess and asked for water and she never came back.  We asked the server who seated us if we could order and she told us our server would come.  That person never came.  We were never acknowledged by any server at all after we sat down.  We were getting impatient and decided to just leave.   We noticed so many inefficiencies during the time we were there.  Servers were congregating in one area.  Servers doing only one thing at a time and no attempt to multitask at all.  I could've done a better job serving!    As we were leaving, the hostess was at the front and we basically told her we had no server, no one acknowledged us, and we never received our water.  She actually told us she was waiting for straws for our water.   How sad.  She couldn't get straws?  She then proceeded to tell us to go to the restaurant next door for better service.  Really?  Are they affiliated?  If so, I highly doubt the service would be any different.  If not, they are just sending customers away by admitting their service sucks.    They have an excellent waterfront location and that's all they have going for them.  I don't even know if their food is any good because the service was terrible.  Such a shame...  What a waste of space."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so much. They have prime real estate in habourfront and a fantastic patio vibe, but the food isn't saying much!   The first time I went here, I ordered 2 glasses of the house red, without asking the price. Most places have a house wine that's less than $7 a glass (in a pub setting). When my bill showed up, I had been charged $24.00 for the two glasses. My fault completely, since I hadn't asked before hand...but wow....for house wine?   The second time I visited was recent and it was ok. I ordered the fish and chips. The portion was huge, but 70% of the plate was batter, and the fish was cold in the middle. I sent it back...which is probably the first time I have ever sent anything back to a kitchen. On the replacement order, the food was at a better temperature, and our waitress was very attentive and friendly the whole time.   I hope they add a few more items to the menu. I'd love to visit again someday, but for right now, I think I'm good."}
{"text":"I'm giving Watermark 2 stars rather than 1 for the location and design. This pub has a nice atmosphere and design; I love the garage door windows. If you get a seat outside during the summer you'll have a great view of the waterfront. However, if you chose to dine at Watermark you'll have loads of time to admire the design and waterfront while waiting for service.  I went with a party of 8 to have brunch at the pub and we waited nearly an hour for food! I hate when staff at a restaurant use the excuse that a big party means longer wait for food (which they did). I took a Chef Training course and it's not that difficult to get 8 meals out at the same time if you have a well managed kitchen. It's especially not difficult when it's the exact same meal. We all ordered the Irish Breakfast; eggs, bacon and toast can be made in 10 minutes so an hour wait is just ridiculous.   As for the meal itself it was pretty standard. The menu stated 3 eggs we're used in the breakfast but the actual portion couldn't have been more than 1 egg. The bacon was stuck together and cooked unevenly, as a result of throwing bacon that was frozen together right onto the grill. It seems petty to complain about eggs and bacon but that's a pretty standard breakfast dish everyone learns to cook at one point in their life. You crack an egg in a hot pan, wait a couple minutes and voilà! Breakfast.   Our waitress wasn't very apologetic and other reviews mention slow service so it must be a given with this restaurant. It's a nice pub visually so hopefully it gets taken over by new management."}
{"text":"All and all the place has fallen into a pit of dispair, in that the place is over priced, and staff aren't as cool as they used to be. With the loss of the daily specials there is literally no reason to go here over Amsterdam Brew House a few minutes away.  If you had asked me what the places was like when I used to go here every night after work 2-3 years ago, I would have said it was great. Prices are a little much but it was worth it for the food and menu. And the staff were all great. Sad that the management ran the place into the tourist trap it is."}
{"text":"Brought a group here for an ESL tour that I'm running. I wasn't overly impressed last time, but we thought that the location was right and we wanted to sit on a patio. I called several days ahead to make a reservation for 8 people.I guess business was slow and it was too cold because by the time we finished the tour the patio was closed. We were fine to sit inside as many of us were cold.  The service was even more so.  I'm not sure if the server was snippy and rude off the bat because he thought the he was going to get stiffed from a bunch of foreigners, but I made a specific point of telling our students that the normal tip amount is 15%. With the attitude we received, I should have told them to leave nothing, but I'm trying to give these students and language and culture lesson, so customs are important.  The minute we sat down he acted like we were going to be a total pain in the ass. He loudly yelled \"So I expect that most groups like this want separate checks, do you guys need separate checks?\" His words were not as biting but his attitude was that of someone who was completely put out by us and our perceived needs.  I politely told him that separate checks would be helpful.  Then he proceeded to yell out \"Just to let you now, I can definitely DO the separate checks, but you guys can't move around and order stuff and switch seats because that will definitely slow me down and you'll have to wait longer for your checks.\"  Spare us the freaking warning.  These are adult ESL students-- not children and we have no plans to play musical chairs. If fact, most of the staff who were working were very unwelcoming and not very happy.  To be fair, the guy who served us on the patio earlier, when we were meeting up, was efficient. A bit frazzled, but at least we got our drinks without the attitude. I get that patios are a pain in the ass. I'm a server, too and I understand how frustrating the job can be, but if you don't like tourists and foreigners, you shouldn't be working at a pub on the waterfront.  The food was ok. Separate bills were accurate, but they really need to work on the attitude of the staff because most of them seem miserable."}
{"text":"Try the restaurants next door instead...."}
{"text":"It's all about the patio, but barely ... *1.5 stars.  If you decide to visit Watermark, before you leave, ask them to post a picture of you at the entrance with a sign reading, \"Please punch me in the face if you see me again.\" I wish I had.  Do not go for the food. Do not go for the service. Prepare to overpay.  The breeze off the lake was nice."}
{"text":"Ok granted,  we came in with a party of 25 for Mother's day. It took 1/2 hour just to take our order and another 1.5 for the food to come out. I guess the order paralyzed the line cooks. Yes, it was a Sunday, but you'd think they'd be ready for Mother's day by the water.  My ribs were dried up, laid atop some soggy fries, drizzled in tangy sauce to cover up the fact that they were dried up and covered in fat at the same time. This little culinary wonder cost $17. I could have ordered twice as much for $25.  Honestly, it was just kinda gross. The waiter was really nice and I felt bad for him, but the management had no idea how to handle this joint. A mess, really.  Go of you are in for some drinks and a view. Otherwise, dont."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. I walked to this restaurant from my hotel. Beautiful restaurant. I sat down at the bar and ordered a shot of JD. While indulge in in said shot decided to go on Yelp to read reviews on what I should order based on others testimonials. The reviews were severely negative and nobody said the food was good. When the bartender came over to ask me what I wanted to order, I said I wasn't sure. He asked why and I told him that almost every Yelp reviewer didn't have anything good to say about the food. He told me that Yelpers were just a bunch of kids that that didn't have anything better to do but leave negative reviews. Well, I'm not a kid and I'm a regular reviewer. Then after I told him that he was pretty rude and put off that I gave that much weight to Yelp reviews. I paid for my shot and ate somewhere else that had excellent food. And I found this \"excellent food\" on Yelp!"}
{"text":"ok so I just read the review below and it's not just us who experienced a very slow and inattentive service. we were told that the server is on training but being on training doesn't mean being rude. rolling eyes at our requests, bringing wrong orders(multiple times) after we wait for 1hr and all that without a slightest attempt to apologize. One apology and I would be satisfied.   Overpriced but that's due to locations.   Honestly, I'd prefer to go to a second cup nearby with the same amazing view and self service and cheap prices.   ah also - no options for vegetarians except few appetizers - sweet fries, regular fries and one salad.  would give it another chance if I wasn't so annoyed by the service."}
{"text":"Great service! I've been here twice and the staff is funny and friendly. I love the view from the patio. This place is great for friends or on a date. Menu as both light and heavy options which is great (ex. sandwiches and burgers and veggie burgers, house salad and beef salad). One star off because there's usually a line up, and because the food is a bit pricey (Lobster sandwich is about $16.00)."}
{"text":"The only redeeming factors: the obvious- location, and the amazing Irish waiter who was fantastic.   Our hostess was rude and abrupt when she informed us that our reservation was for an inside table. We were never informed of this when making reservation, and obviously wanted to sit on the patio. We didn't travel into the city, specifically to the harbour front, for an inside table.   $17 for less than average chicken tenders and soggy fries does not sit well with me. At all.   The menu is very limited, not many choices, and way overpriced. You're clearly paying for the view.   Great location and vibe though."}
{"text":"If you are looking to have an ice cold beer on a summer afternoon - this is the place to be!!! If you are hungry... ehhh go somewhere else.   I had ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered a sandwich (can't remember which one). He said his meal was O.K.. My fish and chips was sub-par and tasted a little stale. The service was OK. Considering the size of this place, and the constant flow of clientèle, the hosts and servers were quite busy to pay special attention to their tables.   The scenery and atmosphere is wonderful, and I would highly recommend you drop by for a drink after a walk along the waterfront."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Monday night, beautiful day outside. No issues with service tonight, maybe because we were on the patio but I actually thought the service was great!  But I can see where the complaints are coming from. Inside, the pub is really big with nooks and hideaways that depending on where you are sitting it might be hard to see. That's still no excuse for your food coming slow, I get that.   We ordered and within about 10 mins our food came. We were surprised, and it was incredibly fast. She had just gone into get our drinks, and food was ready already.   We had the Cottage Pie - beef stew pie with cheddar mashed potatoes on top. It was hearty and very comforting. Came with a salad. I'm wondering if we could have changed it to fries.   She did come by every few times to ask if everything was okay, and I got a new water pretty timely.   Overall for service I think they did a good job. They were friendly and helpful.   These poor girls in short kilts were freezing their asses off on the patio as sunset and around 9:30 I noticed the men came out and became our servers.   For dessert we had the cheesecake which was really decadent and a great $6."}
{"text":"Recipe for Success at Watermark Irish Pub  INGREDIENTS 1 pint Alexander Keith's Premium White (more as needed) 15 medium spicy chicken wings (.50 on Monday nights) 1 table in the sun to combat deficiency of vitamin D  DIRECTIONS 1. Combine the above with a witty companion who will eat at least half of said wings.  2. Ensure that said companion will not take issue with the somewhat messy affair that is eating chicken wings as the licking of one's fingers will ultimately be necessary.  NOTES Minimum wing order is 10 and increases in increments of 5 thereafter."}
{"text":"I don't see an option for Zero stars...so I guess I'll give 1. But honeslty I was so unimpressed with this place that not only did I have to send back my food, but when the manager came and offered to comp the meal and order something else, I couldn't even eat that either! I couldn't even take advantage of a free meal at this place!  I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich at first which came on a stale dried out bun with some over cooked fried chicken. You could get a better chicken sandwich at KFC for 3 bucks (that's not even a joke).  My replacement order was calamari which tasted like it's been sitting in a freezer for 6 months...like fish sticks that you forgot you had in you freezer and then decided to try eating them....I could taste the freezer burn.  But the beer and the view were cool I guess."}
{"text":"Other than prime location, this place misses in a big way.  My main complaint with this place is the excruciatingly slow kitchen. Your chances are less than 50% that you'd get out of there in 1 hour for a lunch.  I don't find anything on the menu that original.   Some of the items, like a \"taco salad\" will actually be in a fried flour tortilla shell, not a corn taco style shell. We complained and got an answer that \"that's the way it's supposed to be\"  If you're just going to drinks or simple apps like calamari - and are not time constrained - it's a good spot. Try to get a spot on the patio - the view will be great as you wait ..and wait... and wait."}
{"text":"It's a typical irish pub down at Queens Quay.  Beer was cold.  Wings were ok... not the best I've had but good.  It's a place I would not go out of my way to visit but if I was in the area in need of a pint of beer, I'd be happy to go back.  The place was very clean and the staff were all cute girls wearing short kilts who were very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't complain since I work in the building and considering everything, I think Watermark is a great pub. Friendly staff, great selection, and overall great atmosphere. I'd only ask that they try to serve people faster at lunch since we need to get back to work."}
{"text":"The location of the WaterMark is what makes it truly great. On a hot summers day, sitting on the patio at the waterfront makes you feel like you could be on a sunny summer holiday. The vibe is relaxed and the staff are attentive and friendly.   Drinks prices are average-expensive but not extortionate and the pitchers are fresh and cold. They do a really mean Caesar too! The food let's this place down a little: they have ample portions but it's just a little lacklustre for the price.   Definitely worth a visit on a hot day, with a similar vibe to the Amsterdam Brewery for half the price and none of the line-up."}
{"text":"This is a great, great local (for me!) find. Especially compared to the bar that was here before, Watermark is a topnotch pub for the area. It is very difficult, when one lives in a tourist area surrounded by Hoops and Shoeless Joes-types, to find a pub that one is happy to visit repeatedly.   I am SO glad Watermark opened this summer and I went very often. Yes, the food took a while to come out of the kitchen at first, but everyone is entitled to a rocky start I suppose. The prices aren't bad at all for the touristy location and the servers are all excellent - never had an unfriendly experience, even when it was a busy Thursday evening in the heat of summer. And I do think the food is above-average for a pub (hint - try the lobster dip with pretzel bread. It's amazing!).   This pub, in the summer, is worth the trip for sure. In the winter, I'm sure it's just like it's sister pubs (Foggy Dew, Pogue Mahone's, etc. I believe). I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry mojito and a Nacho Burger. The Nacho burger was good, and sadly the only saving grace of this meal.   I ordered a strawberry mojito because it was on Watermark's seasonal drink menu. The menu states the drink is comprised of, \"All the classic ingredients; fresh limes, mint, rum, and sugar, with the addition of fresh muddled strawberries!\" When the drink came out the first time the waitress put it on the table saying \"I may have picked up the wrong drink, this looks like a margarita.\" I took one sip and was hit by the distinct taste of tequila. Wanting a mojito (and not tequila), I sent the drink back to be remade. The manager then came to the table. He told me, \"I personally watched the bartender pour your drink, and I assure you that it is rum in there and not tequila. I hold our bartenders to a strict guideline, and if they don't make the drinks to that guideline, they get in a lot of trouble.\" I told the manager that I highly doubt that he watched the bartender pour my drink, because there is nothing he can tell me that will convince me that there was tequila in my drink and not rum. Reluctantly, the manager took the drink and had it remade it. When the drink returned, he guaranteed me that I would \"love this one\". If it was made properly the first time, what will be difference about this one?   On to how the drink was made - The first time the drink was made, the bartender forgot the strawberries in my \"Strawberry Mojito\". The server kindly brought me a glass of strawberries on the side which was supposed to be muddled in my drink. When the drink was remade, there were strawberries in it, however, they weren't muddled, neither was the mint, so my drink had neither of those flavors, they were just floating around as a colorful garnish. The fresh limes? They were non-existent. The drink was made of bar lime, there were no limes to be seen in my drink. For a bar whose bartenders are held to such a high standard when making drinks, there is a serious lack of quality here.    I don't care if it was rum, tequila, vodka, or my drink was totally absent of alcohol. If I say there is tequila in my drink, for the cost of 1 oz of alcohol and a happy customer, REMAKE the drink. I can't believe the manager came over to try to convince me the drink was made properly when it was so far from the truth.   I received no compensation, or apology. I will never return here."}
{"text":"The only reason I even give this place 1 star is because they were nice enough to comp our food due to their horrible service.  Group of friends decided to head down to find a pub to grab some food at after the jays game. Came across this place seemed nice enough. We go out to the patio only to be told that there's no room on the patio for a group of 8 for half an hour.... even though the patio was pretty much empty? We were asked to wait by the bar inside until our table was ready. So we all trek in to the bar inside the restaurant and wait.  Half an hour later we're told we can go outside to our table. We all order small items like wings, nachos, fish and chips, etc. It took 75 minutes for us to receive our food. 75 MINUTES!! are you joking me? I watched many other tables receive their food who sat down after us before we even got our food.  We asked the server, multiple times if they were planning on bringing out our food. We got a bunch of rambling apologizes, kitchens back up, yadda yadda.  Truth be told I was ready to walk out.  It was also very chilly as the sun was going down so it made for a very uncomfortable meal in the cold.  As for the food, it was below average pub food. I had wings that were very very dry and overcooked. gross.  I would NEVER visit this place again nor recommend it to anyone. The only saving grace was the manager came out and comp'd our food for the horrible service we received."}
{"text":"Came to Watermark to enjoy St. Patrick's day, only to realize their entire \"specials\" menu exempts St. Patrick's Day. They literally cut all specials on this day, to capitalize on their customers. Sounds like a money making scheme to me. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"With the exception that this place is located right by the water, and if you sit outside on their large patio and enjoy people watching...I can't really think what else this place has going for it.  So while waiting to start our paddle boating tour, we decided to grab a quick bite to eat here. For some odd reason there was a line up to get in, even though we could clearly see there must have been at least 10 empty tables outside.  When I inquired I was told by the hostess, \"well there are people ahead of you\".  Yes I could see the line up of people ahead of me..waiting...waiting...for tables that were empty??  Anyways, at least the wait wasn't too long.  Shown to our table we had prompt service from our server, who nicely warned us that since they were busy the food might take longer to come, in case we had to get somewhere soon.  That was nice of him to warn us so we could order quickly.  We ordered fish tacos and some of the dips/chips to munch on.  The fish tacos (spicy) were not spicy.  A baby would not find them spicy.  They lacked taste and only tasted a little better when I put some lime on them.  The chips/dips/pita bread were ok - but how can you really screw up that?  Having decided that I must use the ladies room before leaving, I walked through the inside of the restaurant which was practically empty as most people wanted to sit outside  (in fairness this place is HUGE so good for bigger groups) and found the washroom.  Now to say I was shocked was a bit of an understatement.  For a restaurant this large the women's washroom only had 2 stalls??  For a place that can easily hold a couple hundred of people I find this a bit unacceptable  Line ups were forming.  Besides the prime location I can't really see what this place has going for it.  So if you want to come here for the view, by all means do but don't expect much otherwise"}
{"text":"We recently had a work social event here. We had close to 100 people, so they assigned us a large area towards the back of the restaurant with patio view (patio facing east side).   They made the following food for us: Feta-Bruschetta Crostini (Roma tomatoes with olive oil, red onions, basil, feta cheese and balsamic glaze); Pub Garden Salad; Pesto-Pasta Salad (Cold pasta with pesto sauce and goat cheese crumbles); Guinness Mini Burgers (Beef burger with cheddar cheese, glazed onions and garlic mayo); Spicy BanhMi Tacos (Tortillas topped with sriracha aioli, kimchi, cilantro and pulled-pork); Mini Mushroom Poutine (Fresh cut fries, Quebec cheese curds and mushroom gravy); Crisp Chicken Skewers (Crispy chicken tossed in butter chicken sauce and yogurt drizzle); and for dessert, nanaimo bars.  By far, the Spicy BanhMi tacos were the best. I loved them! I want to eat more Banh mi sandwiches, tacos, OM NOM NOM NOM. The rest of the food was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.  In terms of the service. I thought they did not properly assign the waitstaff. They had sufficient staff serving the food to the tables, but in terms of taking the drinks order, there was only 1 waitress serving an area with close to 50 people. They should have assigned at least 2 more in this area. They clearly had the people to bring out the food to our tables.  I ordered an English Breakfast tea but was told they only had Orange Pekoe. I thought that was fine and asked for 4 creamers (to deal with that particular tea's flavour). She brought back green tea with the 4 creamers. I think they can do a better job at educating the waitstaff on basic hot beverages.  Overall, it was a lovely event but I would not personally return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Drink my ordered was bland to start things off. When the food showed up at the table in less than 10 minutes (this was a Thursday evening when a Jays game was starting that night), I wasn't sure if I should be impressed or concerned. Turned out to be the later. I ordered the fish and chips. Fish was okay but nothing special. Chips/fries were soggy, torn up a bit and there were very few. My wife ordered pasta and added Cajun chicken for $5. The pasta was over cooked. The ingredients tasted all from a can and the chicken was thin, boiled and rubbed with season after. She might have eaten half. The service, yeah, that sucked too. We will never be back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Nice location. A large summer patio. Might be cozy in winter.   The Australian and I came here seeking food and some air conditioning. It was a humid day out and didn't feel like sitting on the patio. It was a first date kinda thing and we requested a booth for some intimacy. Unfortunately the booth was a little too intimate. We were completely ignored. I flagged down a passing bus boy and asked if they had thought to employ any waiters. He said he would find us one.  No waiter appeared.  We flagged down the manager and asked where we might be able to find a waiter. At a pub. The manager suggested she could, in fact, act as our waiter in the apparent absence of any wait staff on staff.  We did manage to get our food. The Australian had the thai wrap. I had the Canadian burger. Prices aren't bad considering location. Portion size not bad. Service. Bad. My date confessed she had heard bad things about this place but was too polite, too hungry, and too oogy from the humidity to ward us off. \"A group of my women friends were here and their waitress ignored them, preferring to serve her male tables. You know, she was out for big tips.\"  No effort was made to make up for the shoddy service. \"Hey, sorry for being seated and ignored and having to do everything short of cooking your OWN food. Would you enjoy some desserts on the house?\""}
{"text":"I came here with a large group to celebrate my birthday.  While they did not let me make a reservation on the patio, I was that they did end up seating us there.    Food and drinks were fairly expensive, and not really worth it.  I guess you're paying for the location right on the harbourfront.  Anyway, we sat down and everyone ordered.  I ordered a taco salad.  I was surprised that when it came it didn't have the taco shell, which is the part I like the most.  I was told that they ran out.  Thanks for telling me now (no discount btw).  One of my friends had ordered tacos.  Apparently they had run out of the meat for the tacos, but was only told this once all of the other food had come out.  He had to order again, chicken fingers, and received his food well after we had already started.  What made it even worse was that another friend had ordered chicken fingers the first time around.  His meal didn't even come out until AFTER the person who had to re-order received HIS chicken fingers.  Doesn't really make sense does it?    It was completely unacceptable.  It was clear that the kitchen staff was just not communicating with the waitress.    The only saving grace was that the waitress was really good.  While it took awhile to get drinks sometimes, she had 3-4 large groups in her section, so it was understandable.  The best part, however, was that she was able to split the bills for us no problem.    While the waitress saved the day in a sense, it is unlikely that I would ever come back here.  It's expensive for what you get, and the lack of communication between kitchen and wait staff was just unacceptable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before going on a harbor cruise, was not really impressed. They didn't even have Guinness on tap! They may have had a total of three Irish beers on the menu. The food was a bit more Irish, but we didn't order anything, so I can't speak on that. Service was decent. View was nice, right on the water."}
{"text":"With its incredible scenic views and prime location along the waterway, The Watermark should be a leader in the upscale pub market for Toronto and a great place for good food and drink. Especially during the summer when the weather warms, the patio offers a perfect combination of heat and cool all at once. The reality of it is though, it's a average pub at best.  I have been here a few times, and the first two times it was satisfactory. Nothing out of this universe, but the food was good and the service was decent. But today I think was enough to most likely make this visit my last.   The service has never been the quickest, but the first two times I'd gone it doesn't stick out in my memory as slow. Today was terrible. We showed up as it was still fairly busy and got into line to wait for the patio. The server who was handling the line didn't even talk to us until about 15 minutes into our wait. No \"Apologies for the wait\" or \"Sorry, we're a bit understaffed today\". Not a big deal, but it does help the wait seem more tolerable when you know there's progress being made. After about 30 minutes in line (not that long of a line either), we are seated. One menu for three of us. Server says she'll look for more menus but she never returns with them. We sit there for 20 minutes without anyone coming to see us. Finally (and I hate doing this as I know it can come across as rude) I flag down a waiter and ask if they'll validate parking as me and my friends are considering leaving to go someplace else. The manager hears that we've been waiting almost an hour with no service and says the first round's on the house. Nice gesture, but the beers still take about 15 minutes to get there. We order our food. That takes about 25-30 minutes to get to our table. Friends order the Reuben sandwich which comes with two (not a typo) slices of meat on thick sourdough bread and very little slaw. I order the Fish and Chips, it arrives slightly cold and the chips are dripping with grease. Normally not something I'd care about because it's fish and chips, but it's still excessive. We order a second round, that takes another 10-15 minutes. By now the patio has emptied considerably and there's no reason for this much of a lag. We don't tip (and I always tip). Overall a terrible experience. An explanation would have gone a long way to making us understand, but it wasn't there.  Not worth the trip"}
{"text":"food was horrid and grossly overpriced. the nerve good thing we have yelp here for any of you clever individuals who research and realize to just keep walking when they pass by this evil establishment"}
{"text":"When you're told upfront you have to wait one hour to get served, at least you have an expectation. If two hours elapsed and no meal arrives it becomes unreasonable. Watermark however takes disrespecting it's customers to a fine art by not even providing a time for the meal after two hours.  We cancelled our orders, but that was the least disconcerting aspect of our evening's experience. It was the evident callous and egregious lack of an explanation on the part of the manager Julie. We even paid for a glass of wine that was ordered a half an hour ago that wasn't served.  Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Watermark has a great location....and that's about it? well, not really. the place first opened this year in early May and I've had good experiences so far. I go there so often because I work in the same building on Queens Quay. the food is good and the service is relatively fast, most of the times. I find the food better than the typical pub food. watch out for the daily specials...my favorite is the Fridays $5 Guinness and free oysters at the bar....and you can always enjoy the location."}
{"text":"Gross. Loud. Forgot the chicken on our nachos. Ran out of jalapeños. Loud ass people. To be expected. Food is not good at all."}
{"text":"Great place next to the harbor Nice sunny day Food and service awesome!!!    Must place to experience"}
{"text":"Not everything went well, our order ended up on another table, but the food was good, the beer was good and our waitress (from France) was adorable!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and cheese was decent.  Moderately priced.  Decent portions, friendly wait staff, good patio on the waterfront."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch , my friend and I waited to be seated but were waiting for like 10 min before we were escorted to our table . The view is nice except there is a big boat docked there blocking the view so not much of a view I guess , the Server was ok brought us our beers on time we ordered the lobster club sandwiches which was very good he asked us if we wanted it a salad with it instead of fries so my friend asked for the salad which according to her was good but then when we got the check he charged us $2 for it although he didn't mention that in the beginning . Also when he brought the food there weren't any utensils so we had to wait like 5 min for him Bring some . The place looks very sloppy and unorganized I would go there again for a beer or so but if ur looking for an experience then this is not the place for you ."}
{"text":"Came here for a university alum event on Wednesday night. We had a section of the pub reserved for us.  Nice location - there's a patio area and you're facing the lake. Great service. Food was a meh; your typical pub grub.  When I think of Watermark, I'm not looking in my calendar to see when I can go back.  I would recommend bringing out-of-towners here, but just for the view of the water.  Meh."}
{"text":"They should call this place \"Irish Hooters.\"  I think some do.    Watermark has a very good draft selection in a very good location right on the waterfront.  The food is adequate, though certainly not spectacular.    Interesting eclectic setting mix of library meets sports bar meets restaurant meets soft porn.  Works for me."}
{"text":"The place has one of the best locations along the waterfront, and no doubt it adds to the cost, everything seems about $2-5 more than it should.  Fortunately, the food is actually pretty good (which was a shock after having gone to the other place).    I got the pulled pork, which was pretty good, and great home cut fries, while my wife had the corned beef sandwich, which was average, but she liked her spinach salad quite a bit.  There are plenty of beers on tap, and there are bars both inside and out, so depending on the situation there's always a chance to drink!   The places loses marks mostly because of service.  We were told the wait was going to be 45 minutes, though there were tables sitting empty for over 20 minutes while no one bothered to clean them up.  After they suggested we sit in the bar, they forgot about us and only gave us a seat after we went back and asked for it again.  This has happened twice now, and the second time we just left.  If they can get the service figured out, we'll probably be back.  If not, then it isn't like there's a shortage of pubs around here."}
{"text":"First time in town, and staying at a nearby hotel. So we walked down to the waterfront, hoping for a nice place for lunch and a drink.  This is not fine dining, but a waterfront pub with great views, drinks and decent food.  Overall, a great outdoor spot on the waterfront"}
{"text":"Five stars for location, view  and the service. Four stars for the selection of drinks. One star or wifi connection - was veeeeery weak  and dropped  constantly. One star for food. Chicken wings - LOUSY!!!!! Cooked from what seems to be a very long stored frozen chicken, served microwaved with the wrong very salty Ranch souse instead of Blue cheese . Will recommend to go for drinks and the view, but would not order any food there, even snacks"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast recently with my wife while staying in Toronto and while the food we had was good, I found the staff lackadaisical and ambivalent about being there, let alone serving their patrons.   This attitude seemed to carry over to their breakfast fare, seems odd that they wouldn't offer a fried egg, or omelette, just Scrambled or Eggs Benedict let alone only offering Strawberry Jam as condiment.  While I can't speak about how this location does Lunch or Dinner, Breakfast certainly leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"As the other poster said, Watermark has a great location.  I couldn't help but feel that I was in a faux Irish version of Hooters though, given the short skirts, knee-high stockings, and very low cut shirts.  This was all fine by me, but it seemed like all the servers were slim women who could pull off the short skirt look.  Oh well.  If it wants to be a Hooters, that should be more apparent from the start.  The food was fine but I agree with the other poster that the service was pretty horrible.  After we were seated, we waited for quite some time to be noticed.  Other tables were sat around us and got served.  A woman who sat down next to us, a half an hour after us, said she had to be done by 7 pm, and of course she was served before us as well.  If I knew you had to ask for efficient service, that would have been helpful. I mistakenly just expected it.  I had a salmon tandoori salad.  The salmon was perfectly cooked, but the salad could have used some variety; it was mostly romaine lettuce and a lemon slice.  Partner ate pasties which he said were good.  He said the mashed potatoes tasted like his grandmother's, so I guess that is a good sign."}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the Watermark Saturday evening, July 3, for supper about 7ish.  When we got there, the restaurant was packed but we were seated right away.  It took a while for our server to take our order (though she was nice and apologized for the wait). No problem.  I ordered the curried chicken with no chutney.  It arrived with chutney.  The server saw me picking it out and offered to get me another one.  But it had taken a half hour to get it and I couldn't wait another half hour.  Then I discovered that though the curry was tasty, it was cold.  I mentioned it to our server so she'd know.  This time she said she'd let the manager know.  My husband ordered the Mississippi Flyer sandwich with just a bit of medium sauce.  It arrived loaded with hot sauce.  There were two guys sitting next to us.  One had ordered a lobster sandwich and received a chicken club sandwich.  Huh?!  Like us, he didn't want to wait another half hour for a new meal so ate it.  I sent an email to the manager that night and got an automated response that I would hear back within 48 hours.  Four days later I received an email from him apologizing and inviting us back for a meal.  July 26 update - Today is my birthday and wedding anniversary.  I send an email to the manager last Monday saying we'd like to take him up on his offer of a meal today.  I told him it was a special day for me.  I didn't hear back from him.  We stopped in this afternoon on the chance that he was there.  We waited at the hostess station for at least five minutes.  Servers were walking by looking at us but no one stopped to help us (it wasn't that busy).  Tired of being ignored, we left without anyone acknowledging us.  I'll NEVER be back.  The lack of customer service is appalling.  July 28 update:  I had written to the manager the evening of July 26 to tell him of our second experience.  Two days later, he responded apologizing.  He asked me to send him our receipt and he would reimburse us.  Needless to say, I don't have the receipt 25 days later.  Given this restaurant's history, I'm done with this and am choosing not to get ignored once again."}
{"text":"I visited Watermark Irish Pub with a group of 5 friends/family on an August  Saturday night.  Location is great specially for people watching if your table is in the patio section.  Service was really good as well.  Food in the other hand was poorly prepared. I had one of their special burgers, the beef patty was tasteless! Side salad was decent but you have to pay an addition of $2 to get that salad with your burger, a total of $19! Fast foods sell much better burger! I would not go back to Watermark Irish Pub and do not recommend it just based on the food.   Other members of our party also didn't enjoy their meals!  Just to be fair, I had a chocolate melty cake which was really good."}
{"text":"This restaurant had construction vehicles and a dumpster blighting the harbourfront for months, right up until mid-June. Disgraceful."}
{"text":"the location is great. i would give it 5 stars for the view. but yanno.. i gotta include the food and service.  i came here with a co worker and her mom for lunch. we were playing tourist for the day and wandered around to find watermark.   i ordered the lobster club, my co worker had the house salad and the clam chowder, and her mom had the salad with the salmon. i dont remember the exact names.  the lobster club was AMAZING. i was kinda expecting a bland lobster mix but it was packed with flavor... and it had a spicy kick to it. the fries that came with it were not good. they weren't exactly soggy but they were definitely not crispy. they kind of were really dense if that makes sense. like the insides tasted like the inside of a baked potato.. it was just weird.  my co worker and her mom seemed to enjoy their salads but i don't think they enjoyed their food as much as i did. they both ordered a bloody mary but the bartender made a mistake and made caesers (which we were told were made with clamato juice).. so it took a while to get our drinks.   the food also took a while to come. the service was nice but i felt like it could have been faster especially because it was quite empty when we got there.. but it was packed by the time we left.   i would come back just for the lobster club but i think the next time i'm in the area i'll try a new place."}
{"text":"the view is great.  the beer is good.  the service is okay.  the food is revolting."}
{"text":"Nice waterfront location, great service, unfortunately the food is forgettable.  We arrived in time for $2 off taps and apps... so we ordered some taps as well as calamari, nachos, and street tacos.   Everything we ate was forgettable--the nachos were albeit a huge portion, the calamari had good Chipotle sauce, and the tacos were quite crispy. The cheese on the nachos however were already hard upon arriving at our table, the calamari could be crispier, and the tacos were whatev (but then, I'm from San diego).  Fine place for happy hour with coworkers and sharing food, but probably not for a delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Over priced for what they have on there Menu. Waitresses are nice. Just a note to the Manager it's not good practice to put a couple behind a table of 20 or more people we couldn't even talk and hear each other. $12.00 for 2 fish tacos? hmmm."}
{"text":"THE SHORT STORY: Do not go to Watermark Irish Pub. Mediocre menu. Horrible, horrible service. All they have going for them is the location.  THE LONG STORY: We were told it would take 20 minutes to be seated on the patio and about 45 minutes to receive entrees, but it was was a nice day so we waited by the lake even though we were really hungry. Restaurants usually give a \"worst case scenario\" anyway, so we figured it wouldn't be so bad. We were wrong. It was worse.  It took just under 20 minutes to be seated (on their side patio, not the best spot) and we were disappointed by their menu. First of all, it was a new menu with very few items on it. We though it was a patio menu, but were told that this is all there is for the entire restaurant, all season. By the entrance, they had a different menu posted (their old menu, I guess) with quite a few tasty sounding items that didn't make it onto their new menu. It was all standard pub food and nothing really jumped out at any of the 4 of us. The menu was just kind of \"meh\"...  Still, we waited 20 minutes to get seated and we were hungry so we weren't about to get us and leave. We all settled on what to order and tried to get the attention of our waitress, which took a while. She had a lot of tables to wait on so it took a while to get her over. We started ordering food but when asked about drinks, she couldn't answer some questions so she went off to get a drink menu. She brought it back and said she would give us a minute. We decided on drinks quickly but couldn't get her to come back for a long time. Finally when she came over, she asked for our drink order. When we told her we wanted to order food as well so it would come sooner, she told us that they \"just closed the kitchen\" because the kitchen staff was unable to keep up with orders. She said that people who ordered an hour ago were still waiting for their food, but she can serve us drinks. We were pretty upset after waiting so long already.  My boyfriend asked to speak to a manager, and when he did, he was told that they ran out of food for the day and could not serve us even if we wanted to wait 60+ minutes for it.  OK, I understand that restaurants get their food supplies in the mornings to last them through the day and that they only have a certain amount of pantry/fridge/freezer storage space and cannot make food once they run out, but...  Any well-managed restaurant knows from experience when to note that they're running low on supplies and when to let their staff know BEFORE seating people that the kitchen is or may close for the night so that people don't have to wait over 40 minutes (after a 20 minute wait for seats) to find out that they ran out of food.  Also, for a restaurant in downtown Toronto, right at the waterfront with a sizable patio, how do you run out of food at 8:30 pm on a Saturday on the last weekend of May? ....EIGHT THIRTY. That's crazy.  This is totally unacceptable.  We went to a nearby restaurant where a manager just happened to be near the entrance... he overheard our story and decided that we shouldn't wait to be seated at all. We were served quickly and had really great drinks and food overlooking the lake after all. This was at Wallymagoo's (at Pier 4). They have an extensive seafood menu (I recommend the lobster angliotti) but also a lighter fare menu with lots of gourmet salads, pizzas, burgers, etc.  The manager and our waiter got a kick out of our story about Watermark. Watermark's loss was their gain, I suppose.  The experience has completely tainted my impression of Watermark. I will not return there at all.  Watermark was a complete waste of time for such a boring tiny menu. Even if the kitchen hadn't closed, I'm certain the food wouldn't have been worth the long wait.  Consider yourself warned. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area with nice patios. Do NOT go to Watermark."}
{"text":"Ugh. Not so good.   I wasn't expecting much from this place - it seems like a pretty typical Irish style pub with girls in kilts. Alas, even with my low expectations I ended up disappointed.   I went on a Sunday - we had to wait for a table as it had started to rain so the patio was being moved inside. We were also told that it would be 45 minutes after ordering for food, but since I was warned, not a big deal.   We were seated after about 10 minutes, and ordered drinks and food, and to my surprise the food was out in about 10 minutes! I am always suspicious of too fast food, and I kind of wonder how there were able to turn around my 45 minute anticipated wait to just 10 minutes... but hey, we had food.   I had ordered the lobster club with sweet potato fries. When the food came, I was pretty disappointed with the portion - if I'm going to pay $2 extra for my sweet potato fries, I generally expect there to be more than 15 of them. It looked like someone had eaten half of my fries! The second disappointment - my sandwich was supposed to have pancetta, and didn't. I would have complained but a) I'm really awkward and b) the server didn't really come around. The sandwich also kind of sucked in general - very saucy lobster salad with additional mayo, and one slice of lettuce. Bleh.   My date had the sense to order just a salad, which was good.   There are way too many options by the waterfront for me to bother with this place again - unless maybe they get an all-new menu and kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"I met up with some friends here for dinner. The view of the harbour is nice and the staff is pretty friendly. The food is just alright though. Stick to classic pub fare and beer."}
{"text":"It was convenience so I was giving it a try!  The food was unexpectedly slow, from other reviews it looks like it's not a the first night with this problem.  I hope the owner read the reviews and make some improvements if they want to continue running this business!   For our table, it was over an hour wait for the food, it's disappointing. I ordered the wings, they said 1 lb, I got 8 tiny dried wings.  I picked dry rub, I asked in advance if it will just be pepper and salt on top, the waitress said no it's Cajun rub, but when it arrived it's no Cajun, just salt and pepper which is what I didn't want.  But should I say anything I won't get to eat dinner that night.   My friend ordered ribs and chicken pot pie. They are nothing special, not great, didn't worth the price we paid.  Will never come back.  Rather go upstairs to Pearl, the Chinese restaurant, they have great food and services!   If you really want the patio, bring your own food, it will be much better than this place!  Also, we were in front of the DJ, it was very loud that we couldn't chat."}
{"text":"The location is great, that's about it. Right from the moment we got there, the service was subpar. The hostesses at the patio were incredibly rude and argued with us over empty tables. I can see them there empty, stop telling me they are full. We eventually got seated inside, by the patio, so it wasn't too bad.   The food came out in a strange sequence with half the table getting their orders a full 10 minutes before everyone else. When it did arrive, the food lacked basic seasoning (salt!) and general heat. When the bills came, the server said she had them keep the group gratuity off the bill but actually it was very much there. We couldn't tell if the whole place was very disorganized or if she was trying to pull a fast one on us.   Overall, incredibly unimpressed by this restaurant. You are better off at the hot dog stand up the street."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great view, but what an awful meal!  Three of us ordered the Buffalo chicken fingers.  Really, I believed this was the type of meal no pub could screw up.  But I was wrong.  The fries were stone cold.  After one bite, we could tell that they were made hours ago and had been reheated in the microwave.  That is just plain lame.  When I told the server about the fries, she didn't seem remotely surprised, indicating to me that she knew from the start that they were foul.  She offered to bring a basket of new fries which she did fairly quickly.  But it was a very small order which we shared between the three of us.  She did offer to bring us another basket, but by then it was far too late, we were packing up to leave.  The chicken fingers also were a bit sketchy and sat in my stomach like greasy rocks.  And the coleslaw was a sorry pile of nearly naked cabbage.  For $15, this meal was a mess.  Without getting too graphic, let's just say that I am afraid to stray too far from the house because I may be running back to the loo again.  Foul."}
{"text":"Patio on a sunny afternoon makes up for the overpriced food."}
{"text":"I had kind of a horrible experience here and it was mostly thanks to the waitress. We found ourselves at Watermark following an exciting Jay's game where we consumed a good amount of salted peanuts! Naturally I was dying of thirst, so between the arrival of our drinks and ordering food I went to the bar to request a quick glass of water! This may have been the triggering point which unreasonably led to our waiter blatantly skipping me when taking orders on several occasions, getting my order wrong, and adding extra items to my bill. A little extreme in my view, but hey maybe it was a horrible Friday night. As for the food the Ontario Beef Burger isn't very special (again, could have just been mine), but oddly enough the Crunch burger tasted great. Nothing extraordinary to write about other nibblers as it's just typical pub food.  All in all, Watermark has one hell of a location, which I guess means it doesn't have to try hard when it comes to pleasing the customers (especially when the tip is slapped on for groups). I'd probably avoid it, save the happy hour or other exceptional circumstances."}
{"text":"I have had a bit of a different experience than what other reviewers wrote. I have only been there once (Canada Day in fact) and the place was rammed, both inside and out. We had a male waiter, and for how busy it was, I actually thought the service was really good.  One reviewer commented that the Hoegaarden has a huge glass. I totally agree with this, but don't think you are getting more beer than other pints, because they glass it is served in is really thick, so although it looks big, the volume inside the glass is like everything else.  The reason why I only voted it 2 stars is for 2 reasons. I am trying to leave the location factor out of this review because if you get a table on the waterfront, its a very nice atmosphere, but any restaurant on the waterfront would have this going for it  Although our party of 4 was primarily there for drinks, a plate of nachos and a fish and chips were ordered. The nachos were a good size, but there were so many cracked nacho chips, I'm sure we got the end of the bag. As for the fish and chips, they were just not good. Why? Because they were dripping with so much oil you may have been drinking it (probably a tad exaggerated).  For a pub I find this place more expensive than it should be, but I guess they charge what they do because of their location."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Terrible breakfast. Many better places nearby. Food undercooked. Forgot many items. Non-apologetic. Won't come back."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a working day. Some murder mystery was going on inside with yells and shrieks, but it was too hot to sit outside .  Servers are very non-caring about everything in general, though the guy who served us was efficient . Food was very meh. Nobody had anything good to say bout it, but nobody had anything bad to say either. I had the cottage pie, and it was nothing to remember, though not terrible either.so we had to deal with it"}
{"text":"The only thing that saves this place is the patio.  Mediocre food, awful service, but goddamn is it nice on a hot day.  Save it for a Friday lunch."}
{"text":"I have been to Watermark a few times but not by choice. It's definitely a tourist trap that misses its mark on many levels. The patio is a great place to be on a beautiful day, but like most restaurants along the water, it is overpriced, has spotty service and the food is incredibly mediocre or just plain bad (Captain John's is a perfect example).  The food is just really bad bar food. Sure they call themselves an Irish pub, but there is little traditional pub fare and they don't have a decent selection of beers on tap, and most of the menu consists of bar food that seems like it was made from frozen. Some of the foods I have tried: Calamari -- incredibly greasy, so much that the soggy batter slid off the squid which itself was rubbery. \"Award Winning Cottage Pie\" -- I really wanted shepherds pie, but they don't have it on their menu! Shepherds pie IMO should be on every pub's menu, so their \"award winning\" Cottage pie would be their closest dish. I was really repulsed on this pie and really want to know what kind of award they won for it. The gravy was incredibly thick and was both too sweet and salty. The slow cooked angus beef was actually ground hamburger meat (or at least over cooked beyond recognition). There was very little vegetables in the pie. The mashed potatoes was cold and was of a wierd texture and consistantcy (posssibly made from potato flakes?). It really reminded me of a frozen dinner that was presented a little nicer. The only thing decent was the small salad that came with it. Wings -- wings were not bad and had a nice amount of heat, but then again how hard is it to make wings? Sweet potato fries -- it was decent, but if it is fried from frozen how could you not screw it up. The spicey lemon aioli was bland and a little off. For $9 it was a rip off. Fresh Restaurant serves a killer homemade sweet potato fries served with tasty sauces for much less.  Service was friendly, when they were around. It seems like they are understaffed given the busy weekend crowd. Be sure to grab your waitor as soon as you get the chance or else you will be waiting a long time to get another drink, your check, etc.  The bathrooms were repulsive when I was there. It was filthy and the urinals were not flushing so it contained the overwhelming wrench of old urine of who knows how many patrons, and the floors need a good washing. If you are hungry and don't want to eat the food there, be sure to use the urinals to lose your appetite fast!"}
{"text":"Solid place for a pint and a poutine! It's huge and crowded though so service kind of lags a bit. If you're looking  for a place to lounge while enjoying the scenes of the harbourfront, it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"Dear Watermark,   Your location is unbeatable, hands down!! However your service is slow. Your drinks are watered-down!! Your food, well it's pub food, so I dont expect that much. We were just glad they finally made it to our table!!!  I love coming down to the waterfront and enjoy the lovely lake view that Toronto has to offer. Despite all the negatives, I keep coming back. Honestly, if only you improve just a tad, we'll buy more drinks/food, bring more friends down, host parties, and more... Do it for your loyal customers.  Sincerely, Loyal customer"}
{"text":"Terrible service; mediocre food; terrible service, expensive 14oz \"pints\"; terrible service; not a great beer selection; slow; grumpy staff; beautiful outdoor patio; terrible service; does not take outdoor reservations; pricey; terrible service.  I work in the same building so we gave them numerous tries.... I. just. Can't. Do. It........."}
{"text":"When you wait at the front entrance within the first 10min to be seated and no one says \"Hi\" or \"I'll be with you soon!\", it really does say something about the establishment. First impressions are everything and let me just say we weren't really impressed by the lack of staff on a sunday around midday. Looking around, I saw some tables with dining guests also searching for a server to help them. If you don't have a maitre d in front, at least have the consideration to train staff to glance over once in a while at the front entrance and say hello."}
