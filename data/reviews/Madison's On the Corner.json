{"text":"we used to live in western Virginia with the nearest comedy club being Improv in DC and overall enjoy the comics here just as much as we did in DC.  Plus the costs at Madison's is much cheaper and the food better!    The venue at Madisons is a little different sort of like comedy in a long trailer but then the DC Improv would stuff people in like sardines so for us no problem.  Anyway we love it especially from what we had in Virginia"}
{"text":"FABULOUS PLACE!!!   everything is awesome, shows are always great, food is great and the staff is GREAT! recommend this place to everyone you know!!"}
{"text":"This place seriously needs to reconsider their table configuration in the comedy club.  They actually seat people facing the opposite direction of the stage so you spend the entire show twisted completely around in your seat to see the stage.  Please consider adding some high top tables with swivel chairs instead of the current setup on the same side as the stage so all guests can enjoy the show in comfort!"}
{"text":"I travel often to Fort Mill for business and i have been looking for a place like this for a while. Great atmosphere, friendly folks,  amazing bar tender and great food. I felt i was in one of those Cheers episode. A lot of friendly regulars. Perfect to unwind with friends."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, simply because the drinks were strong enough to get past the vibe of the crowd this particular evening.  A hole in the wall, but seemingly local favorite as exhibited by the local-ness of the patrons. Drinks are cheap (they have a happy hour where drafts are $2.50, along with a couple of other specials), I don't have qualms with that.   It is incredibly loud, and the music choice on a Saturday night (with the exception of a few good tunes) was rather annoying \"trap\" music, as the young kids say. Can't say I got the best impression my first time here, but if people seem to like it as much as these other reviews imply, I might have to make a return- most likely not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Dinner was very good.  The craft beer was also good.  Prices were pretty good too.  The service was absolutely perfect.  Lindsey waited on us and was not too intrusive but also very attentive.  I had the hot chicken nugs and my husband had a burger.  He's a bit of a burger snob but absolutely loved it; it was cooked to perfection.  The fries were hand cut and tasty too.  I will def come back if I'm in the neighborhood again.  Oh.. and the atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  A perfect way to end a busy day.  Thanks again to Lindsey."}
{"text":"Good grub, decent prices. Staff could use a little more hustle, but at the end of the day, it's a good watering hole and fun sports bar."}
{"text":"Who would have thought...a decent Comedy Club in Fort Mill, SC?  Well, this place does not disappoint.  We've seen two shows here, and both, while not nationally known headliners (come on...we ARE in Fort Mill, SC here, people), they were hilarious!  Food is good; HINT - get them to make you an order of Fried Pickle Chips as an appetizer.  Beer selection is also good for a divey type of place like this.  I use divey as a term of endearment for a joint like this....if it were anything other than \"divey\", it would attract the yuppies, and that's the last thing you want.  Great place for some cheap entertainment...we will be returning, and often!"}
{"text":"Definitely a neighborhood bar.  You got your regulars and they usually occupy the entire bar,  most playing buzztime trivia.  Which we love playing!  They have many locals brews on tap,  which is always a plus.  Service is friendly and even though we often are not able to sit at the bar,  service is acceptable.  Numerous tvs for your sporting viewer pleasures. Tuesdays are $3 all drafts, oh yeah.   The women's restroom was a challenge.  Toliet running, lifted the lever - nothing.  Held the outside lever down,  nothing.  Ugh. Embarrassing. Auto towel and soap, rubbish can must lift with hand even though it had a foot option.  I give them this,  it smelled fantastic!  Great place on Tuesdays for those awesome priced drafts and if you just want to chill with no fluff.  We ordered tater tots - they were crispy and did not taste as if they were drenched in oil. The bomb and at $3, a must."}
{"text":"Good place, a locals type bar. You might feel like you are an outsider if you haven't been there a handful of times. Usually my wife gets a lot of attention, \"have you seen a woman before guys?\" Besides that expect a $2 domestic bottle special, $9 wraps, burgers what have you. Everything has always been decent. We have had nice waitresses and played some trivia. Nothing fancy just the corner bar as stated. I might visit this place 2 or 3 times a year just to mix it up."}
{"text":"This place is great!!  The bartenders are attentive and friendly. Every time we go in we get good service. Kaitlynn even has a special drink she makes for me. I hate to call it \"Bar Food\" because the food is really good. Great lunch $8 lunch menu. We like to play the trivia games too."}
{"text":"I have to say I did under estimate Madison's before we tried it out and I was pleasantly surprised. We decided to check it out because I kept receiving emails for free comedy zone tickets. I grabbed the chance when they sent me an email to see Gemini for free. Basically it stated he was a magician, stand up comic and a ventrilaquist so we really wanted to see that. As far as the show it was great. I could of done with out the magic but the comedy and ventrilaquism was great! We actually sat in the front row and we were part of the show. The comic bought us a round of shots and gave us a free dvd. As for the bar itself, we arrived a few minutes early and got to spend time at the bar while waiting to be let into the comedy zone section. They had some really cheap beer, shot and drink specials. They also had a good selection of premium beers on draft. One of the playoff games was on and there were alot of tv's pretty much everywhere. We did not eat, but they had a decent looking menu. Most of the items were fried and it consisted of bar food mainly. I would seriously recommend signing up for comedy zone emails, getting free tickets and checking it out with some friends."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird place to me, but the people who obviously frequent the place love it... I'm not quite sure of what to think.  If a packed dance floor in a sports bar is what your looking for on a Saturday night, I guess this is your place.  Met my friend for a couple of drinks on a Saturday night. She wanted to show me Tega Kay's finest, and she definitely didn't fail to do so. It was \"different\".  A bar on the corner of a strip mall.  I really don't even know what to say.  Just not my crowd.  They had a couple decent beers on tap but this more of a domestic bottles kind of spot.  I won't be back, but it may be your kind of spot."}
{"text":"Madison's is like a home away from home. Friendly people, courteous bartenders (especially new manager Mark) and a good atmosphere altogether. Different specials every night, plus the Comedy Zone in the next room....good times!"}
{"text":"I found an offering on craigslist for free comedy tickets and figured, why not?  I'm new to the Charlotte area from NY and have been to several comedy clubs in NYC and was curious to see what the comedy scene would be like here.  I was pleasantly surprised to have a great night at the comedy zone on a Friday night.  Drink prices were reasonable and the two comedians that were featured that night were HILARIOUS.  I wasn't expecting much considering it was pretty much a hole in the wall in a strip mall (far from what I was used to), but don't let that fool you!  Bonus?  No two drink minimum like every other comedy club I've been to, so had a great night for free!"}
{"text":"First timers for Comedy Zone Ft Mill.  Substantiate Kevin F. comments: Be forewarned it is a very small, intimate environment.  Seating around the 70+ range.  \"Comedy in a closet\" as I like to refer to it.  Hopefully one day they will be able to expand the Zone!  Shoe box 20' wide x ~80' long.  Yes, intimate environment.  Saw Patrick Garrity. Hilarious, entertaining, not vulgar.  Our waitress very good.  Bar tenders fragmented.  I got Long Island Iced Tea.  Got tall pint.  Lady in our group ordered one too.  Her's was in rock glass.  GF ordered Pina Colada.  Nice.  BUT-Pina Colada delivered at table next to us was topped with whipped cream & cherry.  We asked waitress why?  She said probably different  bartenders.  She asked if she should bring whipped cream.  I told her \"yes.\"  She delivered, topped glass with load of whipped cream & cup of cherries.  Excellent.  Then all the tables around us started laughin'.  Added to humorous nite.  We had nachos platter.  VERY GOOD!!  Well presented \"mexican\" style.  Not anglo sloppy mess.  Neat.  Good salsa.  Jalapenos.  Cheese.  Sour cream.  Lettuce.  Attractive presentation and enjoyable to eat.  Nice venue. We'll be back..  We can always use as good laugh with nice crowd.  C&G"}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken wrap (with garlic parm) and was very impressed. I'll be back! Sorry to hear, however, that the original owner who has passed was a Packer fan and that the new owner is more of a Steeler fan :(  Can't win 'em all."}
{"text":"This place was originally Hooper's.  The owners redid the place, upgraded the menu a little bit, and added a small Comedy Zone in a side room.  Hooper's was a little on the rough side, with even a stabbing before the renovations and renaming.  However, they did have good food for a bar.  The place now looks a lot nicer, boasting a lot of nice hardwood decor in the bar/seating area.  Most of the wait staff are helpful and friendly, but there are one or two bartenders who have a bit of an attitude.  The food is similar to what was served at Hooper's albeit a little more streamlined.  Overall, it is still mostly fried apps, a lot of burgers and wraps, and an occasional $15 entree.  The food is a little above par for bar food.  The Comedy Zone is in a small room inside the place with a very small stage.  It probably sits about 80-90 people crammed together.  They often send out free tickets if you sign up for their emails.  It's definitely a good time and makes a good night out - sometimes even cheaper than a movie.  They also offer dinner and a show packages.  If you're on the south side of Charlotte, I'd say go check it out.  It's a cool little place with decent food, reasonably priced, and the comedians are usually funny (though they can often be R rated)."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. Husband got a mushroom burger with hand cut fries and I got the philly with veggies. I'm glad we chose to eat here before the show."}
{"text":"I know that one has to expect that bar food is going to be salty but my goodness, our food was riddled with salt. It was excessive. The service was okay and the prices were reasonable. I ordered a Reuben sandwich with onion rings. The onion rings arrived lukewarm and I asked the server to replace them. I feel like the cook poured an entire container of salt on them. My husband had a burger and fries and said that they, too, were terribly salty. My Reuben sandwich was really good, though and I would order that again."}
{"text":"For a bar connected to a comedy club, their food is really tasty!  Great drink specials and beer selection.  The comedy shows are usually good as well.  A great asset for Fort Mill nightlife"}
{"text":"One word: FILTHY Yelp is making me write more so I guess if filthy left anything out we can say the place is so dirty I think the rats that they had are afraid to eat there because it's so dirty."}
{"text":"Got here late after the kitchen closed and the staff went out of their way to tailor make items so we were well fed and had a great time.  Friendly and accommodating ... food was real good ... wait staff was awesome.  We had a great night out"}
{"text":"Madison's On The Corner is a great sports bar with plenty of TV's and very good food! Now add in The Comedy Zone and it is by far the best place to go in Fort Mill!  check them out at www.thecomedyzonefortmill.com"}
{"text":"I went in with a couple of friends for an early dinner - we specifically did not want to be there for the live music or comedy as we wanted to chat and catch up.  We got there around 5:30 pm and were the only people seated in the booths.  There were a number of people at the bar near the door - a room's length away from us.  The music was cranked up pretty loud - after sitting through about a dozen songs, we asked if it could be turned down just a smidge; our waitress said people paid money to hear their tunes on the jukebox and usually wanted to hear them loud.  Smiled and asked again if it could be adjusted just a smidge - she said she would see what she could do.  Fifteen minutes later the music is cranked UP for a couple of minutes before being lowered to previous volume.  That could have been coincidence, I guess.  Service was slow, but our waitress was nice, and comped my friend's beer when she realized she had forgotten to bring it.  The food was DELICIOUS - we had chili, the grilled chicken sandwich, a burger, onion rings and the sautéed vegetables.  The vegetables and the onion rings were OUTSTANDING.  We probably wont be back because of the noise, but if that doesn't bother you, this place really is worth checking out - I never expected food this good in a bar.  Really nice job by the kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place has the best bar food in the area in my opinion. Not the great for the heart healthy meals, but once in a while it is delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 this time is because they overcharged us for our kids and when I questioned it they said their specials where only on one day a week for kids even though there is a big sign on the front of their building that states differently.  I paid, but came back in after I looked at the sign again.  They refunded the difference, not squabbling over a few dollars but it was awkward having to go back in again and talk to them about it."}
{"text":"While exploring our new area we stumbled on this little gem for dinner one night. The food was had was decent and despite it being early on a weeknight the bar already had a party atmosphere (listen to me, I've become so old!).   We went back one Friday night to see try it as a bar. It was a great experience! Both bartenders were friendly and had a heavy hand with the drinks so we felt like we got a good value. There were plenty of friendly people around to socialize with.  After a few drinks I asked for an oddball cocktail I had been craving and while sadly they didn't have the ingredients on hand to make a grasshopper the bartender was polite and asked me what was in it to see if he could make it. His reaction was warming since I have gotten some odd looks for trying to order a nonstandard drink at a bar where the rest of the patrons are drinking beer.  PS - they had a great variety of beers on tap, including the boyfriend's particular favorite Sweet Baby Jesus which he claims is almost impossible to find on tap."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here for lunch after prom dress shopping.  Yeah, the place is a little dive-y, but the service and food more than make up for it.  It's just a nice, casual place to grab a bite and watch a game or enjoy the company you're with.  And the food is surprisingly yummy for a sports/comedy bar.  I loved the cali salad and my particular daughter loved the chicken wings.  I've never experience the comedy club aspect of this place, but if you want a good lunch at a decent price, I have no problems recommending Madison's on the Corner."}
{"text":"Madison's is a great little \"dive\" bar, wouldn't you know it, that is located on the corner!  Also home to the new Comedy Zone Fort Mill!  Let's separate the reviews.  MOTC:  Very laid back atmosphere, indeed.  Several televisions around for different viewing pleasures.  Large selection of beer available as well as a full bar.  As far as the menu is concerned, I believe I have only been disappointed once with a particular food item, and that was just a slight let down.  There is a wide variety of eats to choose from, making it very hard to make a decision.  I would suggest the Fish Tacos!  These, by far, don't compare to any that I have had in the area including a well known restaurant that has the words \"bone\" and \"fish\" in it's title.  The fried pickles are also a killer choice as either an appetizer or a side choice with your entree!  Hell, just get it as an app and add the homemade chips as the side.  Cuz I said so! ;) You'll thank  me later.  Wednesday is Live Team Trivia Night, Thursday is Ladies' Night (hey now!) as well as Open Mic Night.  They claim to be \"The Home of The Steelers\".  I don't watch football, so I can't  back up that claim with any facts.  CZFM:  Friday and Saturday nights are set aside for Live Comedy (and the aforementioned Thursday Open Mic Night)!!  Such a great thing to have a national comedy club chain around the corner in little 'ol Fort Mill.  They bring in some very solid comedians every week!  It's worth the price of admission as you normally get three stand-up sets in one evening including the host, opener and headliner.  Dinner packages are also available for the Friday and Saturday shows, just pick up the phone and give them a ring-a-ding-ding!  Be forewarned it is a very small, intimate environment.  Seating around the 70+ range.  \"Comedy in a closet\" as I like to refer to it.  Hopefully one day they will be able to expand the Zone!  Support live stand-up!!  Attend a show today!! (well, just Friday & Saturday at this venue...)"}
{"text":"During football season we came here to watch the Steelers game and get some food. Not to my surprise the place was packed. It's a Steelers bar and the Steelers were playing, why wouldn't it be. We settled for seating in the comedy club area. There was another table in their already watching the Browns game. The Steeler game was on 2 TV's a good ways away from the people watching their Browns play. When we asked the waitress can she turn the TV up a little she got a nasty attitude (TV's were on mute). She turned the TV up then left the area. 20 minutes later when she came back she seemed to still have an attitude and ask for our order. We were so turned off by the attitude we said we are not ordering food and she really got a nasty attitude. I was ready to go at this point but God bless my 74 year old dad who did not want to leave and miss the game. We ended up ordering drinks and during our first round she came back to the table like every 25-30 minutes. I, too say the least was not happy especially when the Browns fans did not receive the same treatment. Will not be going back. EVER!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stop by, sit at the bar and wait patiently for about 10 minutes. I could tell the bartender(s) are busy, as they are making drinks on both ends of the bar and walk by us several times. Having been a bartender myself, I can certainly understand the hustle and bustle of the business, but after having not even been greeted or acknowledged  I had enough reason to get up and leave. I'm sure the place is a decent local spot, but next time I am in the area I will certainly go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure :: I am one of the comedians that performed at the Comedy Zone and my meals were comp'd.   That being said ...  I ate here every night when I was in Ft Mill.  I thought the food was very good.  I have been here twice and each time I've tried different items from their menu.  I've thoroughly enjoyed everything.  Tonight I had the spinach and cheese quesadilla and it's one of the better ones that I've ever had.  The staff is friendly and attentive.   For a sports bar in Ft Mill, SC? I can't imagine it getting any better than this.  I highly recommend the food.   As for the comedy? Comedy is subjective.  It's gonna be hit and miss.  My suggestion? Check out the comedian that's performing that weekend ahead of time on YouTube"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy Madison's bar.  Not only is it convenient for the area but the drinks are priced just right. All the bartenders are extremely friendly and know how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Madison's is nice little bar, and they have juicy, good burgers.  The wait staff is usually attentive, and they have a nice selection of beers on tap--not just Bud and Miller.  The only improvement would be if they'd get a local beer.  OMB?  Green Man?  There are many to choose from.  Between the Comedy Club and trivia nights, they keep us entertained (it helps that my team won the trivia last week!).  This might just be the place we become regulars!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but when it came to service I got ignored."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times over the past several years. Just left after treating my aunt and uncle to lunch. Great bar food and surprisingly good seafood. Got all of us drunk and full for under $100. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"The food was great and enjoyed the live band.  The service was horrible. It appears there was not enough staff for customers."}
