{"text":"Great hole in the wall restaurant with freshly made Chinese noodles.  Limited and cramped seating (seriously, where are my legs supposed to go?!).  Authentic Xian style street food, which means some combination of chilis, peppercorn, cucumber, bean sprout, sesame and cumin.

Great vegetarian options.  We had:
- sesame sauced liang pi 
- potato jia mao
- shuan tofu sheet
- shredded potato

All were good."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Artisan Noodle is a very small restaurant located south of Yonge and Finch that can probably sit around 15 people. It is usually packed, so try to come on the off hours if you want to avoid the wait. 

The Bang Bang Mian was very good. It had a great range of flavours and the texture of the noodles was great. Definitely reminded me of some of the dishes I had when I was in Xi'an a few years ago. 

I found the Pork Jia-Mo was far too oily - the bun was soggy on the bottom because it was swimming in its own oil. Though it's a relatively cheap dish, so I suppose I can't complain too much about it. The Zha Jiang Mian wasn't as good as the Bang Bang Mian. I found it could have been a bit punchier with flavour. 

I would come back to Artisan Noodle, but definitely on off hours. Not sure if it's worth lining up for if the wait is going to be more than 20min... especially in the winter. Still a decent place nonetheless."}
{"text":"First time here, on a Wednesday at around 6:30pm. Most tables just started eating so had to wait quite a bit for a table. Finally got seated at 7:20pm. Ordered right after we got seated and food arrived within 10 mins. Server were really friendly, quick service! 

Sour and spicy noodle soup - I ordered this, looks spicy but it wasn't spicy at all...I enjoyed the flavour but there is nothing in the bowl except for noodles, for the price I paid (6.99) I think it is worth it. It looked really oily but when I was eating it, it didn't feel that oily but it's for sure not something you want to be eating everyday. 

Spicy fish fillet noodle soup - my friend ordered this, again there is a chill pepper beside it on the menu but it is actually not that spicy. My friend liked it a lot, generous portion of fish. I had a bit of her noodles, it had a chewy texture, my first time having such noodles, not bad at all. 

We will definitely come back again and try out other plates on the menu!!!! 

TIP: you leave your number with them and they will call you when they have a table for you. While waiting you can drop by the bubble tea place next door, it's called 'easy drink easy go'. That's what my friend and I did. First time there and we enjoyed their drink. You can even bring the bubble tea and drink it in artisan noodle, they don't have much choices for drinks there and servers don't mind you bringing drinks from outside."}
{"text":"The noodle bowls are excellent and warm you up in a cold Toronto winter.  Well made and run by a nice family business."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant but there were a couple things I just couldn't get past.

First things first, the food was good. We ordered: 
- Biang biang mian: Thick hand pulled noodles in a tomatoey sauce with potatoes and beef. It was really flavourful but a tad on the salty side. 
- Chishan mian: Noodles in a spicy and sour broth with a generous amount of toppings. This one is great for those that love sour foods but it was too sour for my liking. 
- Bon-bon chicken: So good! Boneless chicken in a spicy peanut sauce - the sauce is super delicious. 

While we did enjoy the food, it made me super thirsty for an unreasonably long time afterwards. It was very unpleasant to feel so thirsty 6+ hours after dinner. 

Food aside, our dining experience was subpar. The restaurant is excessively tiny - it only seats about 20 and that's already a generous estimate. There's a row of tables on one side and bar seats on the other side. If you are a really tall person, the length of your arms is probably about the width of this restaurant (and that's no exaggeration). Cozy is one way to put it, but for me it was just uncomfortably tight - you are almost elbow-to-elbow with the stranger sitting next to you. Due to the size of this restaurant, waiting time could also be long. And since this restaurant is so small, the people waiting to be seated are basically hovering over you while you eat."}
{"text":"I visited this place with a couple of my friends one day. We were lucky to be able to get seated within five minutes. We were able to beat the dinner rush; as we were leaving, there was already a queue outside of the door.
The food and service were both good. The noodles were hand made and you could tell by the looks, but what it lacks in noodle presentation, they make up for taste. And the price is right at this place. The only downside is that the place is really tiny, so try not to go during prime time."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Food is disgusting. It's clearly apparent that people who lineup and suggest this place have never tasted good asian food in their lives."}
{"text":"?????biangbiang??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Ordered Chongqing hot soup noodles.

The flavor was actually decent but the broth and everything in it was at room temperature for a dish that's supposed to be hot.

I asked the waitress if she can get the cook to just microwave it. She replied, \"The noodles needed to be wash with water, that's why\".

Do the noodles need to be dumped right into the bowl with soup that's been sitting around unheated all day too?"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this place for a while, but was disappointed. Service was pretty bad (the waitresses seemed to forget we were there even though there were only 2 other tables).

We ordered the Chishan Mian and the Spicy Stewed Beef, which they prepared fairly quickly. Both were too oily and didn't have much depth to the flavour of the broth 

I'd recommend going to Big Beef Bowl or Magic Noodle instead."}
{"text":"I would give 4.5 stars. The food was really good only thing was the pork bun was a little oily but had great taste. I really enjoyed the fresh noodle bowls. Food came out fairly quickly. The place is small so expect to wait or get take out."}
{"text":"Texture and chewiness is what I am an seeking in the hand-pulled noodles - amazing! If you are getting the spicy beef soup, just be weary if you have hypertension...rather on the salty side. The beef tripe is nothing short of tasty however, I am biased towards anything with peanut butter.

Tiny, mom and pop feel. Although the tables are really tightly packed, don't worry about people peering at you while you eat...everyone is either busy shoveling the food into their mouths (like me) or are on their phones."}
{"text":"I would rate this 3 star, nothing more or nothing less due to the fact that it's pretty average overall. The jia mo appetizer had really fatty pork belly that required extra seasoning. The biang biang mian was a weird combination of flavours that didn't really do the homemade noodles any justice. I'm giving it a 3 star for the taste of the homemade noodle only."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles in a snug (veeeery snug) little noodle shop. I tried the Soy Beef Noodles which is a pretty standard dish but their special noodles definitely bumped it up to the next level. Portions aren't Pho-sized but filling. Lots of delish beef. My friend tried the Biang Biang Noodles and they had eggs & tomatoes, potatoes and beef cubes, I'll probably get that next time. If you're going there's limited seating so prepare to wait a bit. Minimal A/C and the single waitress is super busy so there's a bit of wait there too...Still worth a visit for the excellent food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely small and for a small restaurant its extremely busy. 
Went there the first time around 3pm, thinking it will be easy to get a table in between meals. Boy, was I wrong. There were only four tables and some seats against the wall but they were all occupied. The place is loud and crowded with people standing around the tables. Definitely not a place to go on dates!
Second time I learned and did takeout. The food was decent but no surprises. Thick noodles with sauce. I would go again. But takeout only."}
{"text":"We (\"Aznboy\" and myself) finally got a table at Artisan Noodle, a Xi'an style North York eatery. This restaurant is very small and very popular. (And very hot.) It's hard when to know is the perfect time to secure a table. We tried at least three times to eat here (once at 2 pm on a Wednesday!) but it was always too busy. Apparently an early Sunday evening is the best time to go?!

We ordered the following:

Pork Jia-Mo
Less than a year ago, we traveled to Xi'an where we tried this dish. If true Xi'an pork jia-mo is 10/10, this was a solid 7.5/10. Definitely not as good, but worth ordering.

Lamb Pao Mo
This was a decent portion, but it could have used a bit more lamb. As a result, you taste more of the herbs than the meat, but still very good and very hearty. Again, if the dish in Xi'an was a 10/10, this was a 7.5/10.

Spicy Fish Fillet Noodle Soup
I have a sneaking suspicion that as a white girl ordering this dish, they may have toned down the spice. It was still very flavourful, though! And the Sichuan peppers (the numbing kind) added a good amount of \"heat.\" Excellent noodles and good amount of fish. I'd give it a 8/10.

Overall: This is a very small restaurant, and while it does not match what you'd get in Xi'an, the food still tastes pretty good and comes in decent portions.

(Also, speaking Mandarin would potentially help when ordering, but the servers speak English so don't be scared to try here if you don't speak Mandarin.)"}
{"text":"Uncomfortable packed-in seating and loud top 40 western music with very mediocre food here.  Maybe I'm spoiled by all the good mainland chinese noodle places in Scarborough and Richmond Hill.  Tried 3 different soup noodles and while the noodles were passable, the soup broths were quite bland.  A few more dishes has excessive amount of oil to them (and my tolerance for oily chinese food is already quite high).  Overall just a very mediocre meal, and only worth coming here if you don't have a vehicle and live in the area.  Tip: go to the other noodle shop just around the corner on Byng, it's much better."}
{"text":"Great noodle. I had sichuan noodle and spicy potato and the spice is just right. 
It's packed 24-7. Better do take out."}
{"text":"Though ramen is still dominating the noodle scene, there's now another option on the block. Like, literally. I can think of at least 4 ramen joints in the area, but Artisan is unique thus far. 

In the teensy space, there are about 5 wall-facing counter spots and roughly 8 two-person tables that can be pushed together.  The walls are lined with what appears to be wooden slats from old cargo trains, complete with date stamps.  I think this is the first Chinese noodle spot I've been to that mixes the Western/hipster deco feel with this kind of food while blasting old 90's-current hip hop.  

And what's \"this food\"?  On our visit, we ordered a Biang-Biang Mian (hand-slapped and pulled ribbon noodles, stewed beef, sauteed tomato fried egg, and mixed vegetables) and a Lamb Pao Mo (lamb stew, bean sprout, organic cloud ear mushroom, tomato, ground garlic, ginger and scallion with hand pulled noodles stir fried in wok, finished with house special marinara sauce) plus wood ear mushroom to share.  Though the menu printed a little chilli pepper beside a couple of items to denote spiciness level, I didn't find them spicy whatsoever.  The hubs actually added extra spicy oil from a nearby metal condiment container to feel any heat (and medium level spice is usually his maximum).  He said that he'd like to try a spicy lamb noodle next time, as he seemed rather ambivalent about his choice for the day. 

I quite enjoyed the noodles that came with my bowl - like flat, wide ribbons, they're denser and much more satisfying than the \"usual\" skinnier, round kind.  If you do prefer those, not to worry - there are several noodle types available here. 

It's nice to have options."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend and ordered the spicy Biang Biang Mian and Pork jia-mo. I heard good things about this place and I was very excited to try their hand made noodles.
Biang Biang Mian had a variety of things inside. The overall flavour of the dish was well-rounded. However it was a bit greasy by my standard, and toppings were all cold while the noodles were only lukewarm. I think I would have liked it much much hotter.
The pork jia-mo was alright too. It was a bit bland to me so I had to take a few bites to appreciate its flavour.
It was pretty clean inside, but I did not like how tables were right next to one another. I hardly had any space to move my arms. If I feel like coming back again, I would probably get a takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique food, savory noodles, excellent ambiance. But the food is too rich that i dont need to come here often haha. Maybe once a year is fine for me. But it's good tho, but.m not for a daily staple"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on the recommendation of a friend of a friend, and I'm glad we did. There's only room for about 14-16 people and it can get pretty crowded, so it's best to come early or do take out. The food is wonderfully flavourful and fresh. For apps we had the xi'an liang pi noodles (sesame version) and the pork jia mo. The sesame sauce on the noodles was light and yet rich. The pork jia mo took a long time to come. It actually arrived after we finished our main. But the pork was so juicy it was dripping on to my fingers and it was worth the wait. 

We shared the yo po biang biang mian with beef for our main. The hand-slapped pulled ribbon noodles were thin and about an inch wide, and they were soft and just on the right side of chewy. We inhaled everything in that bowl, it was so good. There are spicier options on the menu for those who prefer that too. After two apps and one bowl of noodles, we were quite full and it only came to about $27 for two people. 

I wouldn't say this place is life-altering, and it won't do at all for people in a hurry, but it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this restaurant. I ordered the original beef noodle soup and soon realised it was not hand pulled when I got it. I was pretty disappointed but thought I'd give it a chance. While it wasn't bad, there were a couple of things that soured my experience. There first was when I called the server over to ask about the noodle, he literally leaned right over my meal to talk to me and spoke over my bowl of soup. Which leads me into my second point. The place is small and I was very close to my neighbour who sat beside me. Overall the food I'd give a 3 star but coupled with service i have you give a one star. Service is big for me and leaning right over my meal to talk to me wasn't cool."}
{"text":"If anyone got take out or had the time to watch the chefs cook, you get a sense of the people they are; fun, family-like, and meticulous. While waiting for my take out order, I was watching the cold dish & sauce chef do his thing. Usually at Chinese noodle shop, especially a small one like this, you'd expect them to throw together the dish and push it out. But this chef took the time to care about the plating; some of the sauce for the chicken dish dripped on the side and he took the time to wipe it. It wasn't that he had the time because they were churning out dishes like a machine, but it showed that he cared. I appreciate and respect that."}
{"text":"Got introduced to this restaurant last weekend and love it!! Its chicken with sesame(peanut?) sauce was my favorite. Most dishes were spicy and quite oily but that's comfort food for ya. We were 5 people and went there at 5:30pm, had to wait a little but managed to get a seat within 15-20min. Will definitely come back off peak hours."}
{"text":"Artisan Noodle serves Chinese (Shaanxi style) cuisine. I've been there about 6 times. 

Decor/Atmosphere: Its a small, very tight space with minimal seating. There is a beautiful mural and \"industrial\" decorative details that give the space a bit of a trendy feel. It can get claustrophobic, so I would recommend going off peak hours. 

Service: No complaints. The servers do their job and are polite. Since I have come in a few times now, they recognize me and are even more friendly.

Food: I always order the Yo Po Mian. They are vegetarian hand pulled noodles with chili, garlic and hot oil poured on top. It is garnished with potato, carrot and wood ear mushrooms. I LOVE this dish. It is a very close replica to some of the delicious food that I had when I travelled to China. I can also say that every time I've ordered it, it has been super tasty. The food is very consistent. 

Drink: They have basic canned soft drinks and Chinese herbal tea.

Price: Its only $8 bucks for the Yo Po Mian and it is a filling portion of food. Definitely not pricey, and yet worth every penny. 

Overall: I 100% recommend Artisan Noodle. I think they could do really well if they expanded the restaurant. I would definitely bring my friends.

EDIT: I've been a few more times since this post. Yo Po Mian is now called \"Ku Dai Mian\" and sometimes it has smoked tofu cubes in it, and sometimes it doesn't. I lowered this from a 5 star to 4 because of recent experiences I've had with slower service and a staff member being a little rude. I have also found it strange that their site doesn't have any English text, and they also have signs outside their storefront that are not in English (i.e. holiday hours). It just seems a little strange for a restaurant in Toronto to not have a translation."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty small which can accommodate around 16 people at maximum capacity. If you have a big party of 4 or more, you might have to wait for a table if it is busy.

I ordered the pork jia mo, potato jia mo and the spicy beef noodle in soup. First of all, everything was super oily. I know chinese food is oily in general but this was beyond oily on my terms. The bottom crust of the pork jia mo was just drenched in oil which was unappealing. I thought the potato jia mo tasted better because of the spicy sauce. The pork jia mo was a bit dry. I am a person who can't handle spicy foods and when my bowl of spicy beef noodle in soup came, it looked very spicy. However, it was not as spicy as it seemed to be. I chose wide noodles and now I know that I'm not a fan of wide noodles. I asked the employee which noodles were more popular when I was ordering and he just said \"it depends\" with no additional explanation. I wished that the employee described about the differences between the two types of noodles like texture or soup absorption. And finally the soup broth was super oily and the beef brisket pieces were tough to chew down.

Service was good but as I said above, I wish there was more of an explanation on which noodles to choose. The food came fairly fast. There is a bar rest beneath the table which I find not that great if you have long legs. My legs felt crammed since I could not stretch them properly.

Overall, small place that serves super oily food."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is way too busy and mediocre. And there's barely anywhere to sit.

There's better places for handmade Chinese noodles, such as LanZhou LaMian (The english name is Homemade Ramen for some reason) on Spadina."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, for get about servers handing you menus; they are tosses on the the table. A word of caution they barely speak a word of English. Super small place."}
{"text":"Came here awhile ago to try hand pulled noodles but I was a little disappointed. Every time I walk by there's always a wait but there is very limited seating. The entire restaurant could fit 16 people max. 

I had ordered the Biang Biang Noodle and it lacked a lot of flavour. I also found that the dish itself was very salty. Although it smelled very good, it just didn't taste as well as it sounded. The meat was dry and was dish overall was very lack luster. Service was also very slow and disorganized. My noodles came out and we had to wait another 10 minutes for the other bowl of noodles to come out and that was after we had asked about it -- they seemed to have gotten some orders mixed up. 

It's a good place to try just to see the hype but I don't think I'll be visiting again. There are other noodle places in the same vicinity that have better flavour, service and ambience."}
{"text":"Small place but great food. I tried the biang biang mian and pork jia mo for lunch. Having tasted the same stuff in Xi'an, I had high expectations but this restaurant met all of them. I would come back again to get my biang biang mian fix!"}
{"text":"The food portion was good, but some food were too salty. Their service is not good. One time the waiter took down our number and promised to call us when they had a table available. So my friend and I left the store to buy some drinks. After 40 mins, no one ever called us, so we went back to check if they have table available, they said they never had our name/ number on the waiting list. We said we saw your waiter taking down our number. Later on, they found our number from the garbage bin, because their waiter threw it there. It was not respectful at all."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of the food deceive u, this place is #puregarbage, everything is either mad sour or salty for no reason at all.

First of all, we were told there ll b a table for 5 in 10 min, then 40 min later, we finally sat down. Then they gave us water in styrofoam cups, what kind of restaurant use that, do I look like I'm in a food court here? A lot of the time we had to ask them to fill our cups but they only refill half the table (since it's a small place w seating of 18 ppl, for some reason 2-3 staff r always standing near the kitchen doing nothing at all). When the starters came, no plates or bowls at all, does it look like we want to let all the sauce drip everywhere on the table?!? They have 2 different type of #noodles, the thin noodle isn't bad but their big flat noodle taste like boiled lasagne sliced in half.

2 of us ordered the same dish n it tasted really bad, so we told them we don't want 1 of them anymore n take it off our bill n the waitress nodded. When it came to the bill, they didn't take it off at all n when we confronted the waitress about it, she said u guys ordered it, so u have to pay for it. I'm pretty sure it's common sense that when food is sent back to the kitchen untouched, it means that the kitchen fucked up on that particular dish n y should we pay for sth we didn't even touch at all.

{"text":"The dishes served here are from the north-western part of China around the city of Xi'an. I was fortunate to have gone there last summer so I'll try to compare and contrast. The pork bun/Chinese hamburger was decent. Probably one of the better ones I have had in Canada. However their noodles are a bit lacking. It was really really oily. Although many Northern Chinese food tend to use more oil/grease/fat, these noodles were definitely on the upper limit. The oilness overpowered all the taste of the noodles and toppings. 

There are only 3 small tables in the store. So I would recommend take out if you are visiting during lunch/dinner hours."}
{"text":"I came on a Thursday evening for dinner, I had heard about this spot from a friend who loves hand-pulled Chinese noodles and gave it a try since I was in the area. This space is quite small as it only fits about 5 or 6 tables of 2 but the line wasn't too long on my night. We sat down and were greeted by a waitress who promptly took our order. I decided to try the regular pork noodle soup and didn't think it was anything special. I enjoy medium-to-hot spice but the peppers they used completely masked any flavor. The noodles itself were definitely as advertised, hand-pulled & soft but it didn't go with the rest of the bowl. Also, water is self-serve at a small stand in the corner but nobody said anything as we were in the heat (from the summer & the spice). I won't be returning because it's nothing special, there are a dozen better noodle places within walking distance of this place so if you're on the fence about this one; I recommend you turn around and head for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Max 1.5 stars. Absolutely awful and uninspiring, the noodle does have big bowl, but minimal meat and potato cubes (wtf?) nothing special at all, Not fresh and tasteless (it's like having a mouthful of vinegar). I would rather have Korean instant noodle. Would never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Xi'an, I was super excited when I heard about this restaurant opening in North York. However, all the reviews and stories about how cramped the store is and how long the line ups are have deterred me from going until now. But I'm so glad that I went! The food was very authentic and yummy, and I'm already planning to go back with friends again soon!

My favourite Xi'an snacks since I was a kid are the pork jia-mo and liang pi (cold noodles). Both these dishes here were great! It is hard to make the \"mo\" (bread) of the pork jia-mo well, and Artisan Noodles did a wonderful job! The pork inside was also very tender and juicy, and together with the bread it was perfect. Keep in mind the bread is decently thick, so it's better to share this with someone if you want stomach room to try the other items!

We got the Yo Po Biang Biang Mian, the Soy Stewed Beef Noodle Soup and Lamb Pao Mo. I would highly recommend the Biang Biang Mian and Lamb Pao Mo. These are both authentic Xi'an cuisine, and both are made very well at Artisan Noodle. I loved the texture of the hand pulled noodles in the Biang Biang Mian. My favourite dish of the night was the Lamb Pao Mo. The lamb was very tender, the soup was very refreshing, and the Pao Mo were just the right amount of chewiness. This is also a very good dish for take out, as the pao mo is meant to be soaked in the soup, so the its texture doesn't get ruined. Because we ordered too much food and this came out last, I actually packed half of it home, and it was still very yummy the next day at lunch. The Soy Stewed Beef Noodle Soup was good, but very average, and I think you can get something similar at many other Chinese restaurants in Toronto. So I would recommend skipping this if there's other items on the menu you want to try.

I came here on a Friday night with my parents. We waited around 20 minutes before a table became available. The restaurant is TINY. There's around 5 tables along one side and a bar with four seats along the other wall. The tables and bar seating are all cramped together. Due to the lack of space, my parents and I had to wait outside the restaurant. They take your number down, and call you when a table is available. The wait outside would have suck, as it was pretty cold that night, but good thing we parked on Yonge right outside the restaurant, so we just waited in our car. I would definitely have given Artisan Noodle a 5 star, if it wasn't for the fact that you are expected to wait for quite a long time outside in the harsh, cold Canadian winter."}
{"text":"I was quite excited for a new noodle place opening up in the area that wasn't a ramen place! The restaurant is extremely small and was quite packed so seating wasn't that comfortable. I ordered the Chishan Mian and while I really liked the texture of the noodles, the soup base was just alright but there was barely any pork in the soup, which was quite disappointing. It took forever to get the bill at the end of the meal. I think there is definitely room for improvement with staff and service and I do agree with the comments that the staff's English is very basic. Overall, I am willing to give this place a second try maybe a few months later once they have worked out hopefully the kinks of a new restaurant. For now, I am giving this place a 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this little noodle place, so decided to try it out. I ordered the biang biang noodles and the xi'an combo for my boyfriend. So I ordered it in Mandarin because after reading reviews, it seems like the servers know basic English. And bam..waitress who took my order repeated my order in English lol imagine how embarrassed I felt..guess my Mandarin does suck!

Anyways, I had the food as takeout and I must say that I really enjoyed the biang biang noodles. I think it's a good portion and it's very flavourful, The noodles from the xi'an combo is alright, nothing too special I think. But the pork jia mo is really good!

Overall, I would go back again but I'd probably go early as the restaurant is really TINY."}
{"text":"Came here today not expecting much but the noodles were some of the best I've ever had! We had the hand pulled noodles with minced pork, and the XI An combo which had cold noodles, the pork sandwich and an orange soda. The hand pulled noodles were so chest and flavourful, it meshed so well together! The cold noodles were some of the best I've ever had, peanut sauce complimented everything so well. Pork sandwich was a bit oily but so juicy and flavourful. The orange soda was just a Fanta.

Yes the place is very small but if you come during non rush hour it's actually not that bad. I would definitely come back as the noodles were some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Friday night and both got the beef biang biang noodles. The flavour and noodles were very good. Only complain was the wait was a bit long for dinner since it's a small place that seats under 25-30people."}
{"text":"Overall impression: original!
Their Shanxi flavor Chinese noodles are heaven. Most of them are spicy so be careful if you can't eat spicy food. Recommend Biang Biang noodle."}
{"text":"The only way to describe the noodles soup is \"oily, greasy, arteries clogging and heart attack inducing food\".  If you plan on collecting your inheritance, then take your victim to this place everyday.  I guarantee that this place will get the job done. 
The noodle in the soup looks like the chef did not have time to make it properly. I get it that it's suppose to look homemade but it just ended up looking like a big mess. 
It's also pricey for the amount that they give you. I have never seen so much oil in a soup before. 
Could not finish the soup and had to go home and get a bite afterwards. 
Left feeling very unsatisfied and annoyed at spending $10 per dish. 
Seriously, there is more nutritious value in a McDonald's meal. And I don't like McDonald. 
I've been to this place twice.....first and last time."}
{"text":"Soo good and perfect meal for a cold winter afternoon  everything tastes so good and I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is generally busy every time I've walked past it. This time, I managed to catch them 75% full and was able to snag a table before more people came. 

Inside is small and cramped. The seats aren't the most comfortable either. This place is not meant for large or medium sized groups. Music was unnecessarily loud.

The artisan pork jia-mo is a pretty good starter. Thought the braised pork was done pretty well. The bread was nice and crunchy on the outside. 

Braised boneless short rib noodles was pretty simple in that there is noodles, 4 braised short rib, and 2 Bok choys. The braised short rib was pretty soft, flavorful, and done well. But here are my 2 complaints. 1) broth was way too salty. 2) noodles were too wide. It was more like sheets rather than strands. I did have the choice between thick vs thin noodles, so I guess this is the thick version and my fault for choosing it. The noodles also stuck together and was hard to separate each \"sheet\" making it rather difficult to pick up and eat."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good. It's different from the Chinese food I'm used to. (Northern style) we ordered the spicy fish noodle and the Biang Biang mien and the appetizer with enoki mushrooms, tofu skin, the fungus shaped like ears. Small place, service good and prompt. Will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is small, don't expect to eat comfortably here (side note, they have AC!). I ordered the Soy Beef Stew Noodle Soup and thought their hand pulled noodles were good but the soup base was super super salty. All I wanted to do after was drink a giant glass of ice cold water. I don't think they pull the noodles at the restaurants so it doesn't have the \"fresh\" factor but the noodles are still good!"}
{"text":"After a failed first attempt to land a table, the second attempt was not much better. I thought of calling to make a reservations but they outsmarted me and told me I needed to be there first to be part of the queue.

Place is extremely small with only 14 seats. 4 of the seats were along the wall while the other 10 at tables on the other side. Many people waiting piled in or spilled outside. Having failed twice to eat at the restaurant, I decided to order take-out with my girlfriend.

I ordered the soy beef stew noodle soup while my gf got the noodles with beef, tomatoes, eggs and veggies. We placed our orders and was told that it will take 30 minutes since they needed to make a new batch of noodles from scratch. You can tell the chef was working hard but my fear is that he will be quickly tired after a few months while many may go elsewhere given the wait. However, the ordered was filled in 15 minutes and we were on our way back home to try the food.

The special part of the dishes were the noodles were different. From pictures posted on Yelp, they are not the typical flat noodles, It is fairly long and the pieces were pretty big. They were filling but the noodles were 4 big pieces instead of the \"ho fun\" noodles that you see elsewhere. The egg tomato dish was nothing special while the beef stew brisket was amazing with tender slices of meat.

I will probably try other dishes but avoid trying to get a table. Take-out again next time."}
{"text":"Small and cozy place in North York.  Very authentic Traditional Northern Chinese handmade noodles with a modern flair.   Food is good and so is the service.   The thoughtful server even brought hot water for the senior citizen in my group and cold water for the younger ones.   Must try it!"}
{"text":"A bit of downtown Seoul in downtown North York

Ever wonder what a noodle joint in Korea would be like?

This is your answer

Hand made and pulled noodles with a wide variety of options to serve all tasted

Pretty much every bowl is under ten bucks so not a tough decision to make

However there is only seating for 14 customers so it's a bit of a bolt hole but worth the wait to grab a seat

Great service and great food

My dish had wide flat noodles and had the right amount of chew to them and it's a huge portion

All ingredients were fresh and it felt odd I was the only gaijin in the place where the waitress kept trying to explain to me how to eat.....no I know chopsticks  yeah h-mart  yes noodles....hahaha"}
{"text":"The place is really small. Will only fit maximum 10 people at one time. We ordered an appetizer with beef stuffed inside a big bread which tasted pretty good. I ordered the Bian Bian noodle and it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Overall the food is just average by service isn't that great. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic and traditional Chinese noodle places in North America.

 I've been many Chinese noodle places in Toronto and this one is almost as authentic as you can get from Xi'an, which is known as the kingdom of noodles in China.

I will recommend biangbiang mian with Shuan (three). They are authentic and not tasting as weird as the other ones."}
{"text":"Über busy Chinese (most likely Northern region cooking style) noodle place! Worth waiting for a table.

T'was my second attempt going to this noodle joint tucked in a small unit on Yonge street, and there was still a bit of a wait of 15 mins+ for a one seater on Sunday early evening at 6:30pm. However the excited hustle bustle inside the cozy restaurant kept me captivated & I insisted on eating in even though the waitress struggled with where to put me and asked if takeout was an option. 

Once I was happily settled down, I ordered the Chef Recommended Biang Biang Mian with Tomato, Egg, minced pork toppings and a dash of black fungus. Flavour was delightful without worry of it being greasy at all. Hand slapped noodles in my bowl were chewy and widely cut, reminding me of Pappardelle.  I was eating away happily. I would say this place along with its atmosphere has my kind of comfort food~ 

Before leaving, be sure to also order a Pork Jia-Mo bun to have for breakfast next day! Server's tip: microwave for 40 secs & you're good to go!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this Chinese noodle restaurant from my wife's Chinese friend.

We decided to visit on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. We had to wait about 20 minutes before we got a table for 3. This restaurant seats up to 16 people.

We ordered the pork jia-mo, the cold noodle, and the lamb pao mo(sweet potato starch noodles).

Pork jia-mo ($3.99): this was rumored as the best jia-mo in Toronto, I don't know about that but it was tasty and the gravy was not overpowering. The round bread was lightly toasted on both sides, which I liked.

Cold noodle ($4.99): about average taste for cold noodle and under-sized and a little pricey (later found that for $2 more, the Szechuan cold noodle is much better tasting and a much bigger serving; this was on my second visit)

Lamb pao-mo ($9.99)(sweet potato starch noodles): the noodles are in a small, chunky form and the lamb and soup base were decent. I appreciated the light soup base and the aroma of lamb, but if you're not into the gamey taste of lamb, you would not enjoy this. 

I think whether you like this place or not really depends on what you try. I also tried their original beef noodle soup on a second visit and only the soup base was above average.

I give the restaurant extra points for putting a hipster spin on a very traditional Chinese noodles restaurant. You'll see."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Xi'an Famous Foods in New York City and we've never had a good option for this style of food and the vibe in Toronto.  Artisan Noodles is a great option.

Excellent Biang Biang noodles with a good balance of spicy, savoury and vinegar flavours.  The flavours lace your mouth with a just the right amount of heat (OK, after I put a little more chili on, then perfect!) and sour.

Also had the Yo Po Mian which was also good - almost like a vegetarian version of the Biang Biang... without the meat... or tomato... or eggs... OK, so it's different.  But still spicy, sour, savoury good.

Obviously the star of the show here are those hand pulled, hand slapped noodles.  They are wide and flat noodles that are roughly ripped.  They are chewier and denser than your typical asian noodles, and they carry the flavour of the sauces wonderfully.

Also had:
- Potato Jia-Mo - a sandwich made of potato and tofu with a spicy gravy.  The flavour was really good, among the better sandwiches of these types (even for being meatless) I've had, but the bread could have been a bit crispier on the outside.
- Liang Pi - OMG, I love Liang Pi, and this did not disappoint, but with my all the other noodles, it was just noodle overload!
- Tossed Cucumber - Another good dish, fresh cucumbers with a sour and sesame flavoured dressing.  I would order this again all the time, as it is a great fresh side dish that pairs well against the heavy, spicy, noodle dishes.

The only reason I wouldn't rate it higher, is that it is a bit cramped.  There are lots of people going in and out, to pick up take-out, pay up front, that you never really feel comfortable in that place."}
{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is my first time writing a review, but I felt compelled to warn others. 

This was our first time at this restaurant. We had high hopes for this place as it always seemed to have a line out the door. Our service was quick, but other Yelp reviews mentioned really long wait times which would explain the lines. 

First, we ordered the Bon Bon Chicken as an appetizer. To imagine this dish, open your fridge, take out last nights cold left over chicken, slap on a scoop of peanut butter, pour oil all over, add some planters roasted peanuts...and congratulations, you've just saved yourself $7. 

Next I ordered the Biang Biang Mian, and my fiancé, the Spicy Stewed Beef Noodles. The restaurant must have run out of broth because my fiancée soup was essentially all oil. 

I enjoyed the noodles of the BBM, however that was  unfortunately all I enjoyed. It was an odd combination of lukewarm noodles, half cooked carrots and potatoes, weird mushy shredded pork, and what appeared to be scrambled eggs. Oh and salt, lots of salt. 

For a place that had 3 servers and 5 tables, it was very difficult to get a refill of water in my styrofoam cup. 

This was our first time eating this style of food, and maybe we just don't understand it, but overall we were not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"WORST service EVER!!! Seriously, the service is CRAP. Food is not very good. Waiting time for food is DISGUSTINGLY long. 

My sister highly recommended this place because they hand-make the noodles so myself, her and her boyfriend swung down for lunch. The place sits a maximum of 18 and is super tiny. We got 3 spots at their high chair \"bar\" area which only sits 5. For a place this tiny, they need to make their food come out super fast so that they can do a quick turnaround and make more money. However, the food takes sooo long to come out that I can't see how this place makes any money. 

We ordered 3 appetizers (Tossed cucumber, Potato Jia-mo and Sliced Beef (cold)) and 3 noodle dishes around 11:45. The waitress even confirmed our order again by repeating everything exactly. 

At about 12:00, the order of the Potato Jia-Mo came out. This in itself was not very good. It was decent but I probably would not order it again if I ever came back which means I will never eat it again because I will NEVER come back. 

By this time, another couple had sat down at a table and had placed their order. Around 12:20, we still hadn't received the tossed cucumber nor sliced beef (cold) appetizers yet and we noticed that this same table that had ordered their dishes at noon just received both of their appetizers. At this point, we questioned the server why we were still missing 2 appetizers when this other table received both of theirs.  We were told that some of the appetizers take longer to make than the others. Ok. I understand this but make all 3 appetizers and send them out at the same time. Don't send one out and make the other people have to wait for their appetizers. This is common sense. Time your cooking so that all 3 appetizers are ready at the same time. Also, don't time it so that a table's appetizers come out after another table's appetizers who showed up later. This is common sense. Obviously the cooks at this restaurant have no idea about this. 

But seriously, you're going to tell me that a hot Potato sandwich with pork takes longer to make than a tossed cucumber salad and sliced beef which is served cold????? According to their menu the tossed cucumber salad is chopped cucumber and ground garlic with a sesame oil vinaigrette dressing. The sliced beef is braised marble beef slices tossed in a special house soy sauce topped with sesame seeds and cilantro. This sliced beef is served cold. COLD!!!!!! These two items take longer to make than a HOT house made soft MO bread stuffed with sliced potatoes, marinated tofu, fresh tofu sheets and a signature spicy sauce. Let me get this clear, it takes LONGER to heat up all these slices of tofu and make them a sandwich than it does to make a cucumber salad and cold sliced beef? The sliced beef is probably already in the fridge and just waiting to be cut and plated. 

What a stupid waitress if she actually believes this. And let's be honest, she's that stupid that she probably does believe it.

Needless to say, I was watching the cooks in their open kitchen and one cook makes the noodles by hand and then starts boiling the noodles. He does this for each individual dish. They need someone to be pre-making these noodles ahead of time so that they can save time and bring out the dishes. This cook basically cooks one plate at a time before cooking the next one. Now this is terrible time management. I saw a table for two receive their noodle dishes about 10 minutes apart because this idiot cook has no idea how to cook properly. 

I digress. So after waiting 35 minutes, we had only received one of our 3 appetizers and none of our main courses. Another table who had arrived 15 minutes after us had already received all of their appetizers and were eating while we were still waiting for a salad and cold sliced beef. I was ready to walk out on this restaurant but my sister apparently likes it so she went to talk to the waitress again asking where our food was. By now, it is 12:30 and I am hungry and have been waiting for my food (appetizers) for 45 minutes. The waitress tells my sister that the food will come out in about 5 minutes. However, I see her putting our order in as my sister turns around to come back to the table. So this stupid waitress forgot to put our order in even after confirming our order to us the first time. 

My sister wants to give them the chance to bring our food out but by this point, I am so pissed off by how terrible the service is that I get up from my chair and walk out. My sister's bf does the same and my sister ends up leaving. We pretty much ate a terrible potato/tofu sandwich at this dump before going to Crazy Don for lunch.

I am NEVER coming back here again and will be recommending to all Yelpers and friends not to come back here."}
{"text":"Its a really small joint so I usually just drop by when I see there aren't too many people. I had the pork jia mo to start - you can ask them to cut it in half for you, its perfect to share between two people. The pork was juicy and the dense bread soaked up the pork grease/juice. It was yummy.

The Yo Po Biang Biang Mian - as a Korean it was really odd for me to have noodle with suateed tomatoes inside! It tasted super authentic and the garlic taste was strong. However, this dish made me really appreciate the thick hand pulled ribbon noodles that artisan noodle is so known for. 

Spicy Stewed Beef Noodle Soup - I LOVE THIS DISH. I crave it at least once a week.. The beef was juicy and the serving was pretty hefty. They used pretty good cuts of beef. It seemed really oily at first but I didn't mind it as it didn't 'taste' oily when I was eating the dish."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place but everything is too drenched in oil. I know sometimes oil is necessary for Chinese food but all the appetizers were also soaking in oil. Their famous Biang Biang noodles were incredibly oily, I feel that by the end of the meal I must've drank half a bowl of pure oil. Their pork bun was pretty bland.

Overall taste is okay because they throw in tons of spices and you can't go wrong with chili oil, except in this case which they just used way too much. Felt a bit sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Dan dan noodles and biang biang noodles. Flavourful and authentic. Great hangover cure. Minus one star cause not hot enough."}
{"text":"I have visited the restaurant twice. I love the way they set up the restaurant, it doesn't look like any other restaurant. If you go here on the weekend, you might have to wait for a while to get a table. They are quite creative with their menu and presentations. However, the taste is ok, nothing special. I give them three stars because their noodle soups are very oily, like a lot."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 
Reasonable price and the portion is quite large for the price and I went in hungry! Now I know why the girls who were sitting next to my group didn't finish their meal. 

We arrived just at 6 on a Saturday and managed to get a seat in this small restaurant for a table of 5. You can't make reservations here. 

We ordered two of the sandwich looking appetizers which was split into two. I ate a quarter of the potato one (sauce was delicious!) and like an eighth of the meat one. We asked if they could split the appetizers into quarters and they said they couldn't because of the way it was made. Then we asked if there was a knife for us to cut ourselves. They said no. In my head, I'm wondering 'what kind of restaurant doesn't have knives?!' (Side rant) 

I ended up just biting of it and then giving it to my friend after haha. I know sounds gross but that's how you do it if you want to share with more than two people hahahah. Or you get your hands messy from the oil and sauce. 

The main course! Most of my friends ordered the biang biang or the spicy beef noodle as seen on yelp. I ordered the soy beef noodles from the chef recommended session. They'll ask whether you want wide or regular noodles for all of the noodles btw. Apparently the spicy one was good at the beginning but it was too spicy near the end so you're gonna need water.

The soy beef noodles was just right for me, however I wasn't able to finish all of it with the two appetizers. I'm willing to try something new next time though :)"}
{"text":"One of my fave places for hand pulled noodles. I haven't had anything I didn't love there. But my go to is the Szechuan Cold Noodles and for soup noodle the Lamb Pao Mo. Also I would highly recommend the Bon Bon Chicken. Brings me back to when I was in China."}
{"text":"Tender tender tender, omg I haven't had such tasty fish fillet in a long time. It was done at its perfection. However, the broth was very salty, or \"too flavorful\" in a nice way, that I chugged at least 5 liters of water in the next 3 hours... Trust me, the noodle wasn't as spicy as it looked, so be brave. Have to mention their service, it's the finest among all Chinese restaurants I've been. They were extremely polite and efficient. You should go if you are into northern Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"A hidden gem and I do mean hidden. 

Pros: 
huge bowls (beef noodle soup $9.99, cold noodles $6.99 -medium size but filling), handmade noodles in North York, a good size menu

Cons: 
tiny shop (has 4 2-person seats and bar stools for 5-ppl, even though it's handmade it's not as chewy as I'd like

I like this place because it's not easy to find handmade Chinese noodles in the Yonge/finch-to-Shep area. The staff is friendly and the service is not bad at all. 

When it's not busy, I think it would also be a cozy place for a nice casual date 

I'd definitely come back or do take-out (probably take-out for the cold noodles)!"}
{"text":"This noodle place is so legit. I love their hand cut noodles soaked in soy braised beef soup with chunks of tender flavorful beef. So good! And the pork jia mo is great and tasty. A must try. Note, the place is really small, only 5 tables or so. Get takeout. It still tastes good from the plastic container."}
{"text":"It might have been my lack of knowledge of Mandarin, but I had a communication problem in this restaurant, and I found my only way of communicating the whole time I was here was by pointing menu items. The employees' English skills were broken at best, extinct at worst. They seem to have carved out their target market though, cause everyone that was in the restaurant at that time were people who speak fluent Mandarin.

Nonetheless, I decided to try out this place after coming across its website online. I ordered the Biang Biang Mian, as it was one of the recommended items and the ingredients attracted me. The presentation was good, however there wasn't much of a broth to it, so be warned. The noodles were the extremely wide type, which I personally like. The beef and pork were chopped and cubed, and tasted average. The tomatoes and carrots were also cubed and wasn't anything too special.

Considering the size of the restaurant, this place is way too small for the demand it gets. I arrived today at around 1:30pm, when the peak lunch crowd should've left already. I personally wouldn't mind it as much if there was an actual place to stand inside while waiting; the seats crowd right to the door entrance, so if there's a lineup of even 4 people at least 2 are guaranteed to stand outside.

I don't think I'll come back in the short term until the logistics are sorted out."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and they are known for their fresh hand-pulled noodles. I've had their trio appetizer with enoki mushrooms, tripe and bean curd and it's very tasty. Has a hint of sesame oil as well. I've also had their beef noodle soup. It's quite spicy; actually, very spicy. I think they put a lot of chili oil into the broth, so it makes it hard to drink it. It's flavourful though--the noodles (I prefer the fatter noodles, as I've tried both), are chewy and they give you a pretty good amount. I've tried one of their cold noodle dishes before but I wasn't a fan--but that's just my preference.

I usually get takeout from here because there is very very limited seating and oftentimes there is a lineup during peak hours. They have approximately seating for 10-12 people max. I've sat in once but it was so cramped, I don't think I'll do it again.

My primary issue with this place is the amount of oil in the soup. It's not something that you want to eat every week, especially if you're watching your waistline!"}
{"text":"First time at Artisan Noodles, and my husband and I loved it. The place is pretty small with just a few tables, but it's a great hole in the wall. Decor is really eclectic and service was pretty good (one girl was really friendly, while the other couldn't care less). The star of the show are the noodles. I got the hand-pulled ribbon noodles, and they were amazing. Perfect el-dante texture, and the sauce just covered it enough. The last time I had noodles like this is when my Grandfather made them at home. It takes a lot of work to create it, so this was a treat. It's the width of the noodles, the texture of them, and the way the sauce/ingredients just coats them.  Will definitely be back, but this time, I am going to add extra noodles and veg. Love."}
{"text":"Incredible homemade noodles, and delicious broth. The black bean noodle appetizer is refreshing and tasty, and I love all the lamb dishes they offer. 

The space is small, so don't expect to get a seat there. Calling ahead is a good idea, although they're pretty quick about putting together dishes to order. If you haven't tried freshly made noodles yet, you're in for a treat :)"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place.  Artisan noodle is a decent noodle restaurant.  It however suffers from being way too small of a location.  More after the break

Pros:
Noodles are pretty well made
Portions are good

Cons:
Place is way too small

Right from the get go, you will notice this place is extremely small.  There are about 12 seats in the entire place.  Those 12 seats are pretty crammed too.  The wait times are pretty crazy during peak hours.  They at least will take your number down and call you in order when you're turn comes up.  That way you can wait somewhere else.  This is good because they have no waiting area whatsoever.

On to the noodles.  We ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the soy beef noodle soup.  Both were very good.  I've seen earlier reviews complaining about portion size.  Maybe they've listened to those reviews because our bowls were pretty big and they filled it all the way up.  There's a guy in the kitchen constantly hand making the noodles.  Fresh noodles are always a plus.

Here's the problem with place.  As I said before, it's much too small.  Noodle houses in my opinion should never be to small.  I've both eaten inside the restaurant and done take out.  Whichever you choose, you need to make a concession of some sort.  If you choose to eat there, you deal with huge wait times.  Also, you're crammed in with everyone, who are all having hot steaming noodles as well as a kitchen constantly making noodles.  It's very hot in there, not too comfortable.  When you take out, the noodles obviously overcook a little in the container and are no longer as delicious as they should be.  I live 5 minutes from this place so it's not a long time from getting the food to getting home.  Point is, the size of this place makes it so that you can never really fully enjoy this place, which is sad because it's a pretty good noodle.

I like this place, it's just I never believe noodle places should be small.  They would of been much better off choosing a bigger place.  Still worth a try though. Your best off going as a couple max.  Any group bigger and it will be tough."}
{"text":"Ordered their beef stew noodles and it tasted just a-ok.  I also realized the beef stew noodle did not look like the photo on yelp.  Instead they gave us the skinny noodle rather than their signature Biang Biang Mian and just slices of beef, not the large chunks of marinated beef brisket and flank.  It came in a clear broth rather than the darker one.    How come the inconsistency?  I swear you are better off speaking mandarin with the waiters here.  So, communication is a bit of a problem for me.  I could have sworn the menu said beef stew noodles like the photos here on yelp.  I think next time I'll just point to the photo on yelp.  To top it off, there was so much white pepper in the soup and our slices of beef was dry and bland.   So, never mind that my beef stew noodles wasn't really what it should be - even if I had ordered the wrong dish, my dish wasn't much to be desired anyways.  Also ordered the vinaigrette cucumber appetizer -  TOO MUCH raw garlic garnish.   Really left a strong after-taste in my mouth.    Sorely disappointed at my experience this time.  Also did not like the tap water served in styrofoam cup.   The place is REALLY small and cramped.  I recommend going in during non-conventional hours or expect a long wait, which I think is really not worth waiting for.   Just go during non-busy times to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered a lamb dish with noodles and it was terrible. 90% of the plate consisted of overcooked and doughy noodles and mushrooms that tasted gross. The whole dish tasted off and I was extremely disappointed. The service was also unimpressive, the servers never came by to fill up water or ask if everything was alright."}
{"text":"Spicy beef noodles is average. Beef is not very tender. 
Biang biang noodles is great for summer. However the portion is much smaller than our neighbour."}
{"text":"The food looks amazing, but does not taste even close to the real deals. 3 star for friendly stuff though."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely so addictive. The service is mediocre but the quality and tastiness of the food makes up for it big time!"}
{"text":"Having driven past this tiny restaurant and seeing the lineups, we went on a weekday in the afternoon and got a table rather speedily. It has many more menu options than I expected - we opted for the \"pork jia-mo\" and a \"soy beef stew noodle\". 

The \"jia-mo\" was interesting as I've never had it before, but nothing out of the ordinary. The bun portion tasted fresh. 

We loved the thick handmade noodles of the \"soy beef stew noodle\" and the beef was tender. However, the soup was EXTREMELY salty. After having drank a spoonful of broth we resorted to just eating the noodles and the beef (without drinking the broth) but because of how salty the broth was, they just tasted like salty noodles and salty beef. I couldn't taste anything other than the salty taste.

Not to say we wouldn't return to try their other noodles but we would stay away from this one. And it probably won't be for a while before we return. 

And I forgot if they do - but I hope they would clearly indicate on the menu the kind of noodles (thick or thin) for each menu option."}
{"text":"Got take out from this place.  Those who came after us and was seated after our order got food before we did.  Needless to say pretty disorganized, we stood for about 40 min.  

We ordered a spicy pork belly thick noodle and dan dan noodles.  The taste was pretty good.  My only issue was that it was basically noodles in oil.  Hardly of anything else and the portions were pretty small.  This place must be making huge margins if they are basically selling noodles in oil.  Went to get sushi bong after."}
{"text":"The soup base and noodle are good but the meat itself is too dry, especially the beef."}
{"text":"I would say noodle/food is 5* but the service/atmosphere is 1* so i will give it an overall 3* :(.

Super delicious noodle place and their appetizers are super good too! Like the cold noodle and the bon bon chicken and actually I haven't had one that I didn't like yet!

The biang biang noodle is the first one I ever tried and it is delicious and good for if you want something non spicy (°?°) I have also yet to order a noodle that i thought wasn't good!

However - - - - - -  here come's the bad part. the seating areas/tables are so tightly put together that you cannot get in or out without asking the other table to slide their table over a bit to allow you to get out (or unless your legs/butt is 8cm wide. 

Also, the waitresses seem to always have some unpleasant attitude where if you ask for even water you will feel like you are inconveniencing them. Another instance is that it took a while for us to get seated and then   after we started eating our meal and was all settled a group complained about the wait and the waitress pretty much ordered us to grab all our stuff and move 3 tables down so that they could accommodate another group. Then 3 minutes later a couple left so there would have been space for that group anyways. I think it wasn't a big deal to move tables but the way it was handled just felt bad. Stopped coming back to this place because of the bad feeling we get from the waitresses countless times and also due to the difficulty of sitting."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Shaanxi noodles and foods, such as youpomian, biangbiangmian, liangpi, saozimian, roujiamo, etc. They use homestyle handmade noodles, which is the biggest spotlight to me.
Many chinese international students are their customers.Very crowed during open hours. I'm surprised to get an extra roujiamo for a long time  waiting, which is tasty. It is not spacious, so, be ready to wait a long time to be seated."}
{"text":"I ordered Biang Biang Noodles.  Mid China authentic dishes. The noodle itself is cold but the sauce is warm. They also have a hot plate option, it's the oily Biang Biang noodles, I'm guessing they will pour the heated oil to the noodles? Anyway, worth it a try. Tomato+egg+beef is the main ingredient. A little bit Italian style? LoL"}
{"text":"This is my second time here, came here Saturday around 3pm and got the last 2 seats. However, the food took more than 30 mins to come (but rest of the people in the restaurant got their orders, even the ones that ordered after us). The server did politely explained they needed to do take outs thats is why ours took too long. Food is good, many varieties to choose from."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall that serves up delicious noodles. It's definitely a bit more on the expensive side for North York area (compared to other noodle places), but quality is also a lot higher.

I usually order the special combo they have which is the Fanta orange, pork bun, and sesame liang pi for around $7.99. 

The pork in the bun is covered in their delicious gravy and the bun is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Seriously one of my favourite snacks to have and a must try!! The grease from the bun is cut through by the Fanta orange and sesame liang Pi. 

Sesame liang pi has a delicious sauce and it's perfect to eat during the summer weather! This combo is great value for those looking for a refreshing and easy meal in North York area.

I've also tried their beef noodles before (also really good, but broth is on the salty side) and their pao mo bread in some soup noodles.

My go to is still their combo for $7.99. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Little treasure. Noodles soo good and fresh. Great for take out. Super small spot but modern and clean."}
{"text":"Great noodle place. Hand-Made Noodles from Shaanxi region. This place is hip and cool (exposed wood interior finishing) but small like a downtown izakaya 'hipster' joint. Wouldnt be surprised if they got the inspiration from them. 

However, the nooldes are all hand-made and fantastic. We had the XPan Liang Pi (Cold Noodles) and the Biang Biang Mian noodles shared between the two of us. 

The Xpan Liang Pi Noodles are a cold chili noodle however, I thought it wasnt hot or had enough 'chili' taste.. (I prefer mine hotter) but this is still  a very good dish.

Our main dish (Biang Biang Mian) was a main dish... Good combination of diced pork cubes, tomato, egg and the hand-pulled noodles were fantastic....

Its quite busy but I would wait for a table as the place is very small... Its like a small hipster place that you can find downtown but now in North York....

I would come back here again to try their other noodles!

Street parking (green P) is right outside the restaurant.

{"text":"I went on a weekday evening and was lucky to get the last available table. However, it wasn't overly crowded.

Based on Yelp review, we got Pork Jia-Mo as an appetizer. It did not 'wow' me. The bun was crispy, and generous meat portions. However nothing special about the bun. Just salty. 

For the main, I got Biang Biang mian. I loved the consistency of the noodle! So chewy and flavourful. All the topping tasted fresh. I would go back just for this!

Just bf got Spicy Noodle Soup and was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab a quick casual meal. This place is pretty small. It is filled with Chinese, and the tables are too close to each other. You can overheard everything. 

We ordered an appetizer, one noodle soup and one dry noodle. We waited quite sometime for the food to come. Apparently, they prioritize takeout orders. Although we waited a while for it, the food is delicious. The food portion is good.

If I am coming here in the future, I would prefer takeout, as the place is really noisy and small."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant good for a quick meal for maybe 2-4 people max. Not much room at all. 
The negative review goes towards mostly two things: 1) They serve water in STYROFOAM cups? Get with it. its 2016 and I don't care what your excuse is for serving it in a disposable cup... you need to not to do this as it shows you don't care about the environment. You are a full service restaurant, and I can't believe your wall even says \"recycle\" on it to show that you have environmental values... that is so hypocritical....I mean...sure..you can recycle styrofoam in toronto, but having an environmental value written on your wall, and not following suit with environmental practices is just sickening. It shows a huge lack of social responsibility to the environment and it goes to show as I see other complaints about the styrofoam in various other reviews. 2) Cash only or debit with a minimum purchase of $20. Why? Honestly, with the amount of business you get, as it's packed, you can probably afford giving your customers the convenience of using their credit cards.
Food overall tastes pretty good, but I have an aversion to going back because of your business practices. Potato Jia Mao tastes good, the pork one was too greasy for my taste. I don't remember the versions I had being so greasy in China. 
Had their Biang Biang noodles which was tasty but had a pool (literally) of oil as part of their sauce. The tomato and egg tastes good in the noodle dish."}
{"text":"Relatively new eatery around Yonge and finch area.  Northern Chinese cuisine.  Small
place and seating capacity approx. 15-20 max.  Cool industrial decor.  Serivce is good but mostly Mandarin speaking.  The food is very interesting as there are not as much Northern Chinese cuisine other than dumpling houses in Toronto.  In-house made noodle, very Al Dente.  The food is tasty, flavourful and authentic.  Remind me of the food I had in Beijing."}

{"text":"Good food, bad service.

Best hand pulled noodles ever! This tiny hole in a wall is my favourite restaurant in the area. The place is really small and there is usually a line, but their noodles are worth it. I really like the Spicy Fish Fillet Noodle, but their Original Beef Noodle is a must try. I prefer the thin noodles over the thick, they are chewier and are easier to pick up. The Yo Po Mian is too sour for my taste but it is a favourite among my friends, and the Shuan appetizer is good but nothing special. Mediocre service, the staff are quite unorganized and they often make mistakes. Regardless I always come back because food is good and they are conveniently located a few minutes walk from Finch Station."}
