{"text":"Great meal tonight...only wish my sweetheart was with me as the place is a home that was converted into a quaint romantic restaurant. Calamari is excellent!"}
{"text":"As a Western Canadian, I wanted the real Quebec bistro experience. We found it here and now I want to marry this place. Upon walking in the front door you are surrounded by the cosiest, warmest and most inviting atmosphere. The smells set our mouths watering as we surveyed the menu. Being French language challenged, we sought the help of our server and were soon laughing and joking with her as we both worked at interpreting.
My wife had a chèvre chaud salade and I had mussels in cream and mushrooms with wine plus the regular burger and fries. The menu seems dominated by mussels and hamburgers however there was also an extensive chalkboard with many additional items available. We added to our dining pleasure by ordering a half bottle of the house wine. Each item we ate was exceptionally good. The mussels came with a warm basket of in house buns and they were well used in sopping up the wonderful mussel creme sauce. My wife's salad had her raving for hours and she madly wrote down the ingredients with hopes of repeating such a delight back in the west. My hamburger and fries were spectacular and so large that I actually could not eat it all and I am no quitter in the dining department.
We highly recommend this marvellous bistro."}
{"text":"Poutine portion was big but price was a bit over compared to the facing restaurant. Salad size is fine but pasta dishes are too little!"}
{"text":"Endroit jolie, belle terrase, j'y suis allé pendant le festival des percussion de longueil et l'ambiance était fantastique et on y voyait même un peu la scène.

Malgré qu'il y avait beaucoup de monde le service était extrêmement rapide, nous en avons même été surpris. 

J'ai pris des pâtes et c'était fabuleux, le pain au olives à lui seul en vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this restaurant has amazing mussels! So, if your intention is to eat mussels than it is definitely worth going to this place. Why did I give it a 2 stars? 1. every time we asked for a beer there was no more, I asked for a Corona she offered me Heineken instead ( in what world is this the same). I took another type of beer and when I ordered a 2nd one she told me she is out of this one also. I mean who orders alcohol in this place? C'mon ppl its Saturday night not Monday ! 2. I ordered a carbonara pasta which was horrible. I asked to change my plate which the waiter agreed to do and asked me what was wrong with my plate. I explained that the sauce its not carbonara, more like alfredo, probably had used half and half . Another waiter comes and asks me the same thing +  ' do u know what carbonara tastes like?' I thought that was very rude because even if I wouldn't have known the sauce was still horrible. 
There were a lot of wrong things with this place; think twice before going !"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here!  Very cute! The food was great! Biggest pot of mussels I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food was good, portions were adequate (meaning here that you are full afterwards but not too full), reasonably priced for the portions you're getting. The staff was very nice and smiley, but we had to wait a little long by the end of the meal. They actually apologized for the wait, which made it ok. It's got a very kitch decor that makes it quite unusual and unique. Very friendly over all."}
{"text":"Cozy warm and quiet atmosphere. you can talk without shouting. Food and service excellent too. 3 person with wine $120. Quality vs price excellent. I will return"}
{"text":"Walking into this place feels like going back to your Grandma's: knick-knacks everywhere, wood furniture, cosy lighting, comforting food. I tried many things on their menu, including the blue cheese burger, the veggie burger, salads and the poutine, and it never disappointed. Price is good for the large portion size, and they have a good selection of beers. The specials change often (look for the chalkboard!). 

It's perfect for a romantic date. A gem in the often overlooked Vieux-Longueuil."}
{"text":"We had a romantic lunch on a quiet Monday afternoon . Demi Pichet of Sangria was delicious ! Moules Bleu Danois came highly recommended and were decadent , so my compliments to the chef . Our server seemed calm & confident as if she owned the place and gave us plenty of space and time to enjoy our lunchdate . If I were in the resto business my menu would be exactly like theirs , & if I lived closer I would treat my girlfriend to more dates there and try their Nachos , Veggie Burgers , Brunch , and the poutine du jour!! Thank Goodness we chose Comme Par Hasard ,over their neighbours , 
that day!"}
{"text":"Bonne cuisine, plusieurs plats sont excellents, Resto très sympa avec une belle ambiance. Staff sympa et très attentionné! On y va plusieurs fois par an"}
{"text":"Comme Par Hasard (literally \"for as random,\" or \"by chance\") is a cute old home in old downtown Longueuil converted into this very nice and cozy Bistro. It feels like you were invited to a friend's or Grandma's house for dinner, with old traditional chairs and decor, soft lighting, and really friendly service. 

They have a good local biere (beer) menu that has strong beers (7.75% to 9% alcohol) as well as beers on tap and foreign bottles. There is a daily changing chalkboard of specials and favorites.

The three of us all opted for the same daily special, an Okoberfest special with weiners, sauerkraut, with side spoons of dijon mustard, served with pomme frites and 2 small glasses of beer (biere blanc et rouge). The special ($21.95) included  soup or salad. The soup was a deicious pumpkin cream, and the salad included pumpkin, cheeese, greens and beets. 

Dessert was a large mix of chocolate pudding and chocolate mouse, but they had many other choices, like pumpkin creme brulee.

Prices were not astronomical and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place for friends, romance or business."}
{"text":"Comme par hasard is a very charming French bistro which was built inside a house in Vieux Longueuil. Entering at Comme par hasard feels like being invited to eat at your grandma's table; the décor is filled with antiques, drapes, warm light, as well as mismatched table cloths, chairs, plates and utensils. The food is tasty and cooked in their kitchen (resulting in a longer wait). For the vegetarians out there, they have a section in their menu dedicated to veggie burgers (which are excellent). If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the banana cake; it was so delicious I almost fell off my chair!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and I wanted a place that is non-touristy. This place does not disappoint. Each time I returned to Montreal, I travelled across the bridge to enjoy this fabulous place.  Friendly staff. Great traditional French bistro cuisine. Few tourists. Very reasonable price. The menu changed every time. I liked it that most diners spoke French. I tried to speak French too; but when my French started to fail, the waitress graciously helped me out in English. Definitely check out their bathroom: they decorated it like it was from a Hitchcock movie."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"moules poulettes\". The waitress said it had mushrooms with a creamy sauce. The sauce was tasty, but not really creamy (it was more of a broth). The mussels were a bit dry.

Reasonable prices
Nice outdoor seating
Service a bit slow
The bathroom has an interesting decor.. (I was actually scared to go in so I didn't use the bathroom)."}
{"text":"First off, I must say the atmosphere was so delightful.  Warm, cozy, intimate.  Would make a perfect date night place.  We got to choose our table.  Very friendly staff.  They actually spoke just French but had a waitress with some English.  We managed to figure it out together along with bing translator.  We started off with the mussels with smoked salmon.  The broth was heavenly.  So lite and delicate.  The full size was huge.  The 3 of us split it.  I had the duck burger over salad.  It was served well fine which was disappointing since I Love my Burger and duck more rare.  It was also dry.  My daughter got the Mexican burger with salsa and guacamole.  She said it was ok.  My husband got the stuffed salmon  over rice. A little on the small size, but it was moist and good.  It lost points for the over cooked duck burger but the service made the night."}
