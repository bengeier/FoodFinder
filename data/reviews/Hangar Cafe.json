{"text":"We went for breakfast around 11:30 am, and it was understandably packed so late on a Sunday morning. However, by the time we were seated and had ordered, more than half the restaurant had cleared out, so we figured things would move a little quicker. We were wrong. It took 30 minutes to get our food, even though they were still fully staffed. 
My husband had the country fried steak and I ordered the special - the huevos rancheros. Due to some food allergies, I specifically asked that my food be cooked with oil instead of butter and that they hold the cheese. Initially, we thought that might be why it was taking so long to get our food, but when the plates came out there was cheese and I could clearly smell the butter. For that matter, the food was mediocre and room temperature, and cold eggs are totally unappetizing. Another thing - both of our eggs were cooked wrong. If you are a brunch place, I feel like you should be able to cook an egg to order. Especially something as easy as an over easy or over hard fried egg. 
As for being in the airpark- this would be nice if only there were decent windows to watch the planes from, but all you get here is poor service and lackluster, boring food."}
{"text":"They made me Huevos Rancheros even though it is not on the menu.  Hash browns with green peppers and onions on top.  Eggs cooked right and rested on corn tortillas then covered with green sauce (technically huevos verdes?).  Refried beans tasted like canned but were acceptable. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this last Sunday morning and it was great ! Food was great service was great and the atmosphere was great watched the planes come and go from our table and they have an upper deck to sip your coffee from if you want to after your done eating. A little hot but fun with the grandkids! Family place. totally recommend it. Will go back for the lunch soon."}
{"text":"My kids enjoy watching some small aircrafts take off and landing from this cafe. The food is good and service is excellent. It's overcrowded in the weekends it takes 30 minutes to get a seat. But couldn't complain as we get to see some airplanes up close meantime. Restaurant couldn't take reservations and the ambience for family caf√© is absent. There is lot of scope for improvement, I am not sure if they already have plans for it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing especially the breakfast burrito. The novelty of eating at the airport was a nice family experience. The place was really crowded and we didn't get much attention from the waitress. It was nice, however, that there were so many people that no one noticed our loud two year old."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Hanger Cafe for years, I will not go back. I went there this past Sat expecting to get the great service and food. Upon being seated, I was given the usual menu and asked for what beverage I wanted. I responded and waited for over 10 minutes to get coffee and water at which time I ordered a simple hash and egg breakfast.  I then waited for over 30 minutes to get and did not receive exactly what I had ordered.  I food was as usual, good but there service was considerably less than their normal.  I ate and received the bill promptly and after review I noticed I was charged for items I did not receive. I asked the clerk and she took the item off and at the same time mentioned that I had to wait for over 30 minutes. She took the item off and did not even acknowledge the long wait.  I will not return and want to inform others that something happened to this GREAT place and it is NOT as it was."}
{"text":"Lived in Chandler for about a year and enjoyed going here  until the last time. No familiar faces and food just not up to prior visits. Service was a little off too. Thought maybe it was just us, but our son and his girlfriend said the same thing, something seemed off about their visit too and they didn't think they would go back. Too bad, was a great place until the beginning of June."}
{"text":"The venue is more of the selling point than the food -which is your average breakfast food (I have only attended in the mornings).  I attend for early breakfast as this seems to be the best time to see the planes landing or taking off.  It is attached to the hangar and you can walk into the hangar to get a closer look at the planes currently getting maintenanced.  If you want to go someplace different and unique -go here with the kids or someone that loves to plane watch -the atmosphere is a fun experience but be ready for a bit of crowding unless you sit outside on the patio --bring a jacket if this is your intention during breakfast during cooler weather -gets chilly!"}
{"text":"Tried it last week. Went with a friend who flies in chandler. Tried the fried steak and will get it again. Good service and really Fun place with a view on the runway for those of us plane lovers!"}
{"text":"Our family chose this before a baseball game today and very glad we did.  Cool place, friendly staff, tasty b-fast menu.  For a Sunday morning, we didn't feel rushed at all.    I had the biscuits and gravy....excellent.  We checked out some of the single engine planes next door afterward.  Highly recommended for anyone wanting a little something different."}
{"text":"The worst service in all of Chandler.i have been here a dozen times and it never improves. Takes 10 minutes to get a menu and silverware. Another 10 minutes to place an order and then 30 minute to make an egg. I am a person who enjoys supporting non-big chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service. The village in is only 2 miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, terrible food.  Had heard good things about this little place and was looking forward to enjoying breakfast.  I ordered the pancake breakfast: pancakes, two eggs and bacon.  Asked for bacon crispy and eggs over medium. The eggs were barely warm and barely cooked, the pancakes were  just OK and when I asked if I could have real butter was told they didn't have any...ever. The waitress said real butter is the number one thing customers request. Hmmm, and yet the owners choose not to make it available.  $25 (myself and hubby) before tip for a very disappointing meal.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I eat at the Hangar quite regularly and always have had great service and great food.  I stopped by today after 11 hoping to have an awesome breakfast, but they stopped serving. Oh well, onto lunch!  I just WISH they served breakfast all day.  Still one off my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Food is average , but the atmosphere is great!   So neat to watch all the planes on the runway. Nice place to take out of town guests for breakfast _"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on 5/30/14.  Got there about 1030 and ordered.  The place was packed full but we got seated quickly.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  The food took a long time to come out which is the only reason five stars were not given.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience!  Our 3 yr old son loves airplanes, and we've heard that this place has great food and it's very entertaining for kids.  We went in for breakfast around 8:30 and didn't get our food until 45 minutes later- for 2 meals!  Thank goodness we brought in a snack for our son to hold him over, because the supposed airplane entertainment was nothing to be excited about!  Not too mention this place is crazy loud inside.  We left feeling terribly disappointed with our meals, irritated with how loud it was, and cheated by the lack of ambiance/entertainment.  The menu seems pretty decent, til you actually get the food!  Tasteless.  And the coffee was awful and overpriced.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Decided to try someplace new for breakfast and am so very glad we decided to come here. The service was excellent and the food fantastic. The atmosphere on the patio was an added bonus. Highly recommend this cute place for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"I was personally so excited to be moving so close to this cafe! I had heard a lot about it and I don't know if I just had a random bad experience but today I went in-around noon to get a take out order. I asked if I could do a salad and half a sandwich combo and instead of caesar or Greek get a small Cobb without chicken (so bacon lettuce tomato cheese avocado) and I would pay $3 EXTRA-the owner said sure then some kitchen staff says no then waitress says maybe then 2mins after a long hard discussion and me offering to pay WHATEVER extra amount I have to; I was given a final NO. So I moved on and ordered a tuna sandwich and 2 BLT sandwiches (takes maybe 10 mins at home to make these) my order was put in at 12:20 I got my food at 1:15-55 mins for two BLTS and a Tuna (not melt) Sandwich!!!! Anyways I go to pay and the owner rings me up and comes to $39.85 with two drinks, I think wow that sounds high for each meal being $7.50 and I only had 3 so I bring this up to the owner and ask for a receipt. He writes $39.85 on a piece of paper an gives it to me? Um no, I want to know how much things were. \"well you have $7.50, $7.50, $7.95, $8.95, and two drinks\" nope sorry I only had three meals-So the owner looks and all he says is \"good thing you looked\" yeah thanks, I just saved myself $10. I got no apology for the wait or anything! Least give me a drink for free or something! The waitress was very nice-been there awhile I'm assuming and she's a doll but other than that-terribly horrible experience!!!! 
P.S. I ordered \"extra like double bacon\" on my BLTs (word for word) and when I get home and open up there are 5 pieces on each....you guys only put 2.5 pieces on  a BACON lettuce tomato sandwich normally? 

Very unhappy with my experience. They could have been more accommodating even when it came to the salad when I'm
offering $3 extra and they act like I'm asking for prime rib on the side! I wanted to love this place especially since it's 2mins from my new house and the location is fabulous for a sit down breakfast- but unfortunately I will never ever come back. Unless for some odd reason I wanna wait almost an hour for something I could make in ten mins."}
{"text":"Good size food but the location is what makes it great.  My daughter loves coming to watch the planes take off and land. We'll be back just for the location!"}
{"text":"Everything you would expect from a greasy spoon cafe. Plus they have the added entertainment of being right beside the runway at Chandler Municipal Airport, so much fun for the kids. Pancakes, bacon, eggs, hash browns, burritos, sandwiches, wraps, etc, etc, all real good. Busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Have now been a few times for breakfast and the food is consistent and good. Service is attentive, food come up fast and hot and the atmosphere is interesting with antiques and airplane memorabilia throughout. It's fun to walk by the many private planes on the runway and thumb through the airplane sales magazines they have in stacks on the breakfast bar.

Breakfast burritos and bloody Mary's are both excellent and popular from how many we have seen served while watching the cooks from our bar seats."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf ever. Great service in old time diner atmosphere I just love it!  If you want something different and funky, with small planes taking off and landing in front of the diner...this is the place."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! I have two boys ages 4 and 2 and they love coming here and watching the airplanes. However the service is terrible. There was a wait which wasn't very long but when they called our name they pointed to our table without a word. It took 5 minutes for someone to bring our menus. When she did she just sat them on the table without any introduction and asked for a drink order. After bringing our drinks our server took our order, never once smiled, and didn't come back outside until bringing our food fifteen minutes later. Food is good here but service definitely takes away from the experience."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast. Busy on weekends, so expect to wait. But if you love a great 'old school' breakfast, this is the place. I almost don't want to post this review, because it's already super busy on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't put any stars if I could. First time being at this place and my husband and i got kicked out. A gentleman asked how many were in our party, we told him four and he sat us down. A lady came over and asked if our party was there. My husband told her they would be there shortly. She then told us that they couldn't seat us until the rest of our party was there. So she told us to leave. We will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Want to take out of towners someplace cool that's not a chain restaurant? Hanger cafe is a greasy spoon and they keep your coffee cup full- it's excellent. They have WWII style calendar girl pin ups on the wall.

I usually get biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"What's cooler than eating a delicious breakfast right on the tarmac while watching the planes take off and land? Service here was excellent and food moderately priced. A totaly unique experience I've never seen anywhere else. Can't wait to take my son here when he is older."}
{"text":"Very cool unique little restaurant.  Great place to take kids, especially boys. :) they may have a tough time finishing their meal though.  Mine were very distracted by the planes."}
{"text":"good food, always super busy. the tiny dining room always makes me feel like I have to rush to get my food down to let the next people in."}
{"text":"Excellent diner food and ambiance! We have been going here for years, and it's one of our favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"It is a little-known fact that The Mustache was once a famous pilot, before he began his illustrious career of late-night reviewing of exotic locales on Yelp.  It is a much more widely known fact that The Mustache completely made that story up to try and impress a lady once, and the tall tale held.  Oh well.

Famous pilot or not, I really, really like this place.  It is an actual fact that I love a good greasy spoon, and this counts.  It's a mom-and-pop type of restaurant situated on airport property, the kind of restaurants that used to dot every town back when general aviation airfields were all over the place.  They've been dying off quite a bit over the past thirty years, and though there's no sign that this could happen to the Chandler Airport anytime soon, I'd still urge you to get out and enjoy this place before some bureaucrat decides to take your fun away.

The restaurant itself is fairly small, a smattering of a dozen or so tables indoors, with a nice covered patio containing five or so tables outside.  The patio is the place to be if you enjoy aviation, as you'll get a bird's eye view of operations on both runways.  It can be thrilling to watch a plane drop out of the sky and land in front of you, then taxi on over to the restaurant and shut down so the pilot can hop out and sit at the table next to you.  It almost feels like a relic of an earlier, simpler time.  

The restaurant operates for breakfast and lunch only, and both will please you.  The breakfast burritos are outrageously good, no matter which type you choose.  Their hash brown mean business, and are unlike any other hash browns I've tried.  I don't know how to quantify this, you are going to have to try them yourself and tell me what they do to make them so darned delicious.  Lunches are the standard fare, including sandwiches of cold and hot variety, burgers (which default to a more well-done style than I prefer, so be sure you specify if you like medium-rare), fries, and salads.  Their chicken caesar comes with chicken marinated in what I thought may have been lime (delicious!), with only a smattering of the dressing.  If you're ordering the salad, you don't want the fattening dressing anyway, so this is probably a good thing, though I'd have enjoyed juuuust a bit more of the sauce.

The staff is lovely here.  They're used to being bombarded by children and are very patient with the youngsters who \"just want to see planes.\"  It is not unusual to see a waitress greet a regular with a friendly hug, or for one to give a child a high-five as they depart.  It's a very down-home feel here, comfy even for first-timers.  If you're really nice to them (or if you just ask), they'll direct you to the second-floor observation deck after you've paid your bill.  That's a nice place to watch some aircraft for a while if you're so inclined, and very few people seem to know it is up there.

One thing worth bearing in mind is the obvious...this is an airport, and a fairly busy one at that.  There are lines painted on the ground in various places that indicate you're not to cross them on foot, and there are very valid reasons (i.e. spinning propellers) for that.  Being mindful of that will get you far."}
{"text":"I live 2 miles from this restaurant but my GPS drove me all around town trying to locate the establishment. What should have taken 5 mins took 20! My advice: look it up on Google maps before you go and skip the GPS. The food was excellent (had the chocolate chip pancakes) and the coffee was hot and fresh. Well seasoned servers that know how to wait tables. Food arrived very quickly. Prices fair, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Next door is an airplane garage and we were allowed to walk though it and take photos-- my little one got a huge kick out of being so close to the planes. This place is a rare, local gem. We will def. be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite local place for breakfast. Always great service and never a bad meal. Airport burrito is a favorite."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Solid food and kids love the airplanes. They let you walk through the hanger too!"}
{"text":"Great service from the staff and very generous and affordable meals. I had the Belgian waffle and it was amazing!! Very fun to take your kids and look at the planes as well! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"TIME MACHINE ?
Just tried this place for the first time. Felt like I had been teleported back to rural Arizona circa 1973. A small cafe where land owning geezers gather to while away the morning over coffee and stories. Only thing missing was the nasty cloud of cigarette smoke and bloodshot eyed cowboy wanna be's still up from the night before. Hallelujah for progress. 

The food, service, and atmosphere are old school good. But this place is small and crowded so stay away! This is my new breakfast place, all mine!"}
{"text":"I went to Hangar Cafe after a friend recommended it to me. I love little places like this...takes you back in time. I had breakfast and got a 3-egg sausage omelet with hashbrowns (with the onions!) and white toast. EXCELLENT food. The service was great, too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Homestyle food in this not so well kept secret in Chandler.  The place is really impossible to just drive by and stop in for breakfast. But it's worth seeking out. 
The food was great, inexpensive and plentiful. Nice menu, and friendly staff. I'm glad my friends suggested going here, otherwise I never would have found it. We had a little wait for our table due to the popularity on a Sunday, but it is well worth the 15 minutes for a table! Please try it out!"}
{"text":"This is my first review and felt like they deserve the one star I'm giving them for their poor customer service. My husband requested to go here for Father's Day for lunch, as it's a yearly tradition. However, when we showed up at 11:30 to get lunch that didn't give us the option. When we checked in they told me it was going to be a 30 minute wait, which we were ok with. After I checked in, I asked to see their lunch menu. The host told me that with how busy they were they might not serve lunch until noon. I said that was fine since we probably wouldn't be sat until noon anyway. After waiting 15 minutes I went back in to just make sure they hadn't called our name (I went back to the car due to it being so hot outside.. they have no waiting area inside). The host looked at me and said \"to be honest with you, we're probably not going to be serving lunch for awhile. Since we're so packed.\" It's now 11:45, 15 minutes before their said \"lunch time\" and she's telling me they're not going to serve lunch it at 12:00 now. It's kind of confusing considering they're a cafe that has breakfast and lunch. They close at 2:00 so I'm not sure why they wouldn't serve lunch? The host seemed to be annoyed at me for the fact that we wanted lunch during normal lunch hours. I'm very disappointed in this place. It was a yearly tradition to go here on Father's Day for my husband and they basically refused to serve us lunch during lunch time. Looks like we'll be finding a new place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Hangar Cafe for a while but never thought about writing a review, so here it is now. Amazing breakfast and amazing service. I was there with my 2 girls this morning, the food was great as well as the service. I love the cubed potatoes with eggs and sausage. Today I splurged and had the cinnamon bun on top of the eggs and sausage, made fresh. It was just amazing. I totally recommend this place. To top it off, I walked around the airplanes on the tarmac with my kids afterwards which is always a treat for me..."}
{"text":"Always have a great time at Hangar Cafe! My kids love it and the food is yummy. Love the local vibe feeling you get in this small cozy breakfast and lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Came here from a recommendation from a family member, and I was super excited to try it out from how much they hyped it up. 
(Mind you, it's our first time here)
We get there, my fianc√©, and 2 month old. 
Walked into the overly crowded and ridiculously small \"cafe\". Got looked at by three different waitresses before we were acknowledged. One waitress told us \"sign in!\" So we signed in after we saw someone else do it, because we had no idea how this \"cafe\" worked.  After we wrote our name down, and stood as far out of the way as we possibly could to not be in the way of everyone... but that was impossible. 
This place is so overly crowded, way too loud, not worth it... would have rather got breakfast at McDonald's. At least I wouldn't have to yell across the table in order for someone to hear me during a conversation. 

Definitely way too hyped up for what it actually is."}
{"text":"$3 for kids drinks is crazy. For two adults and two kids we paid $60 for breakfast...asinine! The food just isn't that good, and we had to listen to kids pounding around above us the whole meal. We used to love this place but won't be going back. It used to be reasonably priced but no more, I think they've gotten too big for their britches."}
{"text":"Yes, I am actually giving this place of all places a 4 star. I did not expect too much from this place from previous reviewers but if you view it as a greasy spoon, which it is exactly that. I have been here 3 times and tried 3 different items and the food was done very well, it is basic with a little twist especially their hangar burrito  is what it is called. The quality of the food is not on par with Matts Big Breakfast but the preparation is and everything fits well together. Yes it is greasy, but the grease is actually for something and that is to make the hashbrowns a little more crunchy , the chicken steak all so crisp and the corn beef hash has a nice crispy crust on top. All those things make the dish just a little special and I have had hashbrown  and chicken fried steak where it was soggy, the corn beef hash feels like mash potatoes. I don't go here often because I don't want to shorten my time here on earth, but once in a while it does make life better.  Plus on an early morning it is great to see the planes go up. Be warned, it does get busy as all good places do, well in AZ some bad places also. I am always here at 7:00 AM sharp and there is a good crowd already."}
{"text":"This place has the location down, that's for sure.  But that's about it.  The food is just terrible.  The ingredients are low quality--i.e. thickly sliced lunch meats with huge veins of fat running through.  And sometimes even rotten--i.e. the blue cheese gone bad on one visit.

My dad loves this place because of the airport location, but after half a dozen lack luster to disgusting visits I refuse to go back.  They could REALLY use new management, a new menu and a new supplier..."}
{"text":"What an amazing find! Got to watch planes take off while eating - great for kids! Food was very good - great value! Will definitely come back. Shea was our very accomodating waitress. Limited hours - only open til 2pm."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fun atmosphere! Planes coming in and it right outside the window! We had their special airplane omelet it was absolutely delicious!! This is now one of my top breakfast places, I'll be bringing family and friends here from now on"}
{"text":"First time here today and this place is so good!! No doubt I'll be back. Food was amazing and the customer service was excellent. The food was out very quick and drinks on the table as well."}
{"text":"Let me just say I would have never thought there was a cafe down there. The place is small and busy because obviously who doesn't want to enjoy breakfast at an airport with a view or them landing and taking off. Aside from the view there food was delicious I enjoyed the gyro omelette with the sauce on the side and I just fell in love! It's a family friendly and just all around amazing place to go."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until I saw the reviews on Yelp, and I live right down the street. 
I went for breakfast. It was kind of difficult to find. We sat on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and watch the planes take off and land. I ordered the chorizo burrito that was recommend by the server. It was served with hash-browns and wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla. It was really good, a bit spicy and a lot greasy. The ham steak looked good as did the omelets. The server was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice (except for the loads of kids). Try this little place, its a cute hide away with good food."}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I have been here twice. Both times the service was great and the food was amazing. It's novelty is perfect for out of state guests, which was our motivation for our second visit."}
{"text":"I've taken this restaurant down a couple notches because success has spoiled them a bit and I can tell they're cutting corners. The service is clearly not what it used to be and neither is the food, although it is still pretty good. It's now more the crowded experience of going to the airport and waiting on long lines to be seated. It just doesn't feel like the same neighborhood good time place anymore. Meals aren't prepared with pride and pizzazz anymore. Has success spoiled the Hangar Cafe? I think it's going into that dive...."}
{"text":"Ordinary food but extrodinary ambiance. Service is terrible outside on the patio (u are forgotten since its full of patrons inside) but that's where u catch all the propeller planes going by the cafe. Our Monday morning 10:30 late breakfast got us to see 3 single engine planes drive 20 yards past our table. Saw a Fairchild plane I believe. Oh yeah back to food: had a vegetarian omelette and french toast. The omelette came with premade biscuit (blah). With coffee it was $27 including tip. Kinda high but interesting location to eat at."}
{"text":"Love going here for breakfast. The staff is really nice and the food is excellent.

We enjoyed seeing the planes and there is an upper deck where you get a better view. 

I recommend the outside seating if it is not too hot."}
{"text":"Love you this place. Good breakfast not the best I've ever had but pretty good. It's in the airport so the kids love you watching the planes take off and land. Go here for breakfast you won't be disappointed. The breakfast burritos are really good"}
{"text":"If your looking for yummy food and great service, stop by the Hangar Cafe! We stopped for breakfast and our entrees were all delicious. 

The cafe has a very homely and comfortable feel and even the other patrons were friendly!

Great spot and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This gem of a breakfast joint is tucked into the Chandler air park. I hope when the facility \"grows up\", the Hanger Cafe stays serving up classic diner-style breakfasts with a southwestern flair. If there's one part I wish would change...it's the speed of service. I do like to dawdle over breakfast some days, but here you do feel like you need to get your food order in when the drink order is placed and get your check when/if coffee refills are made for fear you may not get either for a good long while. Still, I recommend this place often and will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place actually, wasn't too impressed with their salad but my grandmother's Philly was great! I'd like to try their breakfast next!"}
{"text":"When you pull up to find a bunch of empty police cars parked in the lot, you just know the food is going to be good. Because...well...cops always find the best places to eat ;) It's a little hole-in-the-wall kind of diner that I never would've known about if it weren't for Yelp. There wasn't much airplane action going on the morning we went, but the food and service was good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited 11/3/13.

I have seen this restaurant show up on Yelp prior but never had the chance to go.  Looking for breakfast place and we were in the area. 

This is a nice \"Cafe style\" restaurant.  Located just off the runway and parking area for the planes at Chandler Airport. 

The menu is very much a Cafe type of menu with nice comfort food.  Breakfast and Brunch is the way it appears on Yelp. 

This is a keeper. Nice hole in the wall.  

They were very busy but we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Maybe the only complaint is that there is no shaded areas for waiting. Lucky it was Fall and not summer. But if we had come 45 minutes later, about 12:30, probably would not have had to wait at all.

We both had breakfast burritos.  I had the Airport Burrito. Loaded with pieces of chicken fried steak, hash browns and egg. Covered with a good sausage gravy. (Maybe one of the better sausage gravy's I have had in while.) Girlfriend ordered the Hanger Burrito which had beef, beans and egg. Covered with a Green Chili sauce which was also very good. 

Service was quick.  Food was good. 

Review of menu also shows some nice sandwich selections. 

This will be a regular at this point if we can remember it is there when we are in the area."}
{"text":"A good breakfast joint with a great view.  Not only can you chow down on some good omelets and other breakfast entrees but you get to see airplanes taxiing, taking off, and landing at the same time.  You know a place is good when a seat is hard to come by on a Saturday morning and there is no way to tell this place is there from the street.  This place is deserving of repeat business from me."}
{"text":"1. The food is DELICIOUS, and cheap.

2. The two waitresses are like walking ash trays who breathed in my mouth as they leaned over our table and gave me a sampling of what it would be like to kiss a smoker. Gag.

3. Drinks were deposited with fingers touching the tops of the cups, leading me to ask for three straws, please.

4. We were seated by the bussers tubs, and I was reapeatedly splashed with dirty dishwater -- but, thinking I was probably just lucky to have a seat w a view of the planes, I didn't say anything.

5. Our OJ was room temp, so we carefully spooned ice from our waters to cool it off.

6. She tried to upsell me grilled onions!!! 

waitress: \"Would you like grilled onions?\" 

me: \"Sure.\" 

Seeing her writing on her pad, \"add onions,\" 

me: \" oh, is there an extra charge?\" 

waitress: \"yes\" (not saying how much, just pausing coldly) 

me: \"then, no thanks.\" 

It's like when waitors say: \" and would you like soup or salad?\" insinuating that it's included with your meal, a la Olive Garden.

Unfortunately, I will be back. It's the closest restaraunt within biking distance, and my family loves to see the planes (so I am outvoted)...I truly appreciate good, cleanly service, and usually tip at least 20 percent, so it's not as if I am just some picky, ungrateful customer. This time I left the tip to the mercy of my husband. Sigh... I will be back, with a good attitude and a watchful eye. Just had to get these things off my chest. All the other reviews seem good, so maybe it will grow on me..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! The potatoes are amazing and believe it or not the spicy bloody Mary's are incredible!!! Great atmosphere and the owner Lilly gives the missing home town feel that's just not there anymore. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Pros: Hearty food, big portions, reasonable wait, pleasant friendly service. 

A good place to bring anyone who might be into planes as the front tables (inside or patio) offer a partial view of the runway.

Cons: NOISY & food could have been hotter (cool potatoes )."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place if you want to get out and take advantage of a change of scenery. We've been here a number of times and usually make it a point to take out of town visitors by to enjoy the food and atmosphere. I would say that we are here monthly - we go that frequently.

It can get pretty busy but that's to be expected for a great place like this... the service is pretty attentive and the food is pretty good breakfast fare.

This place is worth going to if you're looking for a good breakfast place..."}
{"text":"This place is in a slightly odd location but is worth going out of the way for! It has an old-midwest diner feel. Friendly staff. Good food. Decent prices.

I got the egg-salad wrap and man was it good. The deep friend mac-n-cheese was also heavenly!

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The menu always tempts me with several alternatives.  Sitting outside is great when the weather is clement.  Indoors is cozy.  The service is friendly and effective.  The espresso is excellent. Enjoyed the black bean wrap this morning."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, both good and bad; I decide to take the chance and take the fam there to enjoy a nice Saturday morning breakfast. Well, we arrived late and ended up having lunch. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. We were seated outside on a semi-enclosed patio. That day was very windy and cold. It was also very loud.. 
After waiting 30 minutes, we finally got our food. The description on the menu for my husbands sandwich said \"piled high\" What he got was totally different.. Maybe one slice of turkey was in his sandwich. The food was not that great.. 
Got the check and when to the counter to pay, I asked the owner to itemize the bill. I didn't feel comfortable paying just the total written on the bottom of the check. 
Well, WHAT DO YOU KNOW!!! There was a mistake.. Not only is he charging people a different amount then what his menu reads, but he is also taxing every item.. 
You are supposed to tax the whole amount after everything is rung up.. Not each item.. Gheesh! 
After arguing with him and creating a rucus in the restuarant; I was very glad to leave.. No apology was ever given and we will not be returning.. 
I will be contacting the airport to advise of them of the tax fraud going on there, as well. Usually I don't care about a few cents, but if he does that with everyone, it equals out to thousands of dollars a year.. It's ethically NOT RIGHT... 
What a cheat!!!"}
{"text":"I live very close to the Hangar Cafe and never knew it existed until my motorcycle buddies told me about it.  It is just like one of those old fashioned corner diners I used to eat at when I was a kid.  And, the service was absolutely fantastic.

I did try their salsa (for my potatoes) and it tasted like bottled - I would love it if they made a fresh Pico de Gallo salsa ... 

I can't wait to go back there again!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go her for quite sometime Bc i thought it was a cute idea and I'm so happy i finally made it!! The place is diner style, super cute and retro! Food is all classic no frills but super tasty! The staff their are super friendly, and it's fun to just sit and watch all the little planes zoom bye! Got the bacon burger and Bf Got the French dip! Good prices and good food! Would recc this place to kids i think they'd get a kick out of the scenery!"}
{"text":"If you are going to the Hangar Cafe on a Sunday for breakfast be sure to allow for plenty of time. We had breakfast with friends last Sunday and there was about a 20 minute wait. The service was very good as is the food. Large portions. The menu is pretty typical and it is a good place to take the kids so they can see all the airplanes. We have been there a couple of times now and I'm sure we will return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! My kids loved watching the planes take off and land, and the other patrons were all very friendly...felt like a small town cafe with a bunch of regulars who come in every day. 

The diner style food was good, and I would recommend the hash browns. The staff was also very friendly and worked with us to accommodate our kids' food allergies. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very unique, little greasy spoon spot in Chandler! I'd recommend investing a little money into it for updating/expansion otherwise the food and service are always great!"}
{"text":"truly meets the definition of hidden gem.

the boyfriend and i have a great sunday tradition. on saturday night we open up Yelp and search for new places we haven't had breakfast at yet and then try them out sunday mornings. it's a great way to learn different areas and discover some delicious food. so, we were looking at the area around us in Chandler and noticed a little pin located within the Chandler airport. it didn't seem possible that there could be a restaurant there so we did some more research and found their facebook page. indeed they were open 7 days aweek for breakfast and lunch. we thought we 'd give them a shot.

i'm so glad we did! located right in the middle of the private airport, the hangar cafe gives you the ability to stare at awesome personal places while munching on some serious diner style breakfast. the portions are pretty large, so be prepared to be full. i had the hangar cafe eggs/hashbrowns standard staple and it was great! eggs cooked to order with crispy hashbrowns. the coffee is pretty decent too.

i'd recommend getting there while the church crowd is still occupied. it can get pretty busy and a wait for a patio table can take up to 40 minutes during peak times. you want to sit on the patio so you can look at all the planes taxi and take off. this place is also super kid friendly. a lot of the people who own the planes will let the kids approach when the engines are off to take a peak inside. really a whole lot of fun for the kids or the kid in you :)."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on the 4th of July for breakfast. There were three of us and we shared three different meals - Apple pancakes, the airport omelet and the Greek omelet. All three were delicious and we will definitely return for the yummy food, the excellent service and the fun ambiance. It was an enjoyable and tasty breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We love this place! It's usually very crowded since its a smaller building however that's a testament of how good the food is."}
{"text":"The food was cold. The warmest thing on our plates was the fruit. I ordered eggs sunny side up and they weren't cooked properly. They were still raw as in the whites were clear. My mistake on ordering sunny side up I guess. The best thing was the toast. The corned beef hash tasted like it came from a can. I'm just disappointed because I really wanted to like the place. It's a fun location. The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"Took my 3 boys to the Hangar Cafe, not so much for the food but the fact is next to the airport. I ordered the green choke burrito which was good. My boys loved, as the restaurant is right next to the runway and we got to check out the planes in the hangar next door. The wait staff were nice and the food was prepared very quick. I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and being at the airport provides great scenery.
However, the service has severely declined !!
To the point its not worth dealing with even for the food.
Too Bad !!!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed as we came for lunch. Wanted real food but they are breakfast only until it runs out. How weird is that? They are also out of tea and it's not even noon."}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast! Definitely in an awkward location, but great scenery. They even serve mimosas and bloody Mary's. Staff was very friendly, quick and attentive. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I had so much fun looking at the planes on display after our meal. Everyone was so kind!! I love finding new places to eat that are fun like this!!  They even offer joy rides with their planes by scheduling an appt.  What neat find!!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with my dad and my son. Excellent service, great food and amazing atmosphere. Such an inviting staff and really friendly. The check for breakfast was a bit high but the atmosphere and service were well worth it!"}
{"text":"A Hangar Cafe Haiku:

Butter Colored Grease
Magical, Viscous Pond
On Plate, In Body

The Japanese really had something going with these haiku.  If it isn't worth saying in 17 syllables, is it really worth saying at all?  True, this is contrary to every facet of my conversational style, but...

I look for only two things in a breakfast place.  Eggs and hash browns.  If there are eggs and hash browns at a restaurant, it is a-ok.  But if you go to Hangar and sit at the bar, you will see them slathering a paintbrush into a golden vat and then smearing what comes out onto english muffins, into recipes, on to the griddle, and so on.  And that warms my heart in a way that would make every nutritionist cringe.  The bacon is cooked to that sublime level of disintegration where it just melts in your mouth.  Pancakes--decent.  French toast?  Actually quite palatable.

But the chicken fried steak? Now we're talking!  A dish that comes with all four of the food groups (i.e. butter, fat, grease, lard) making a succulent primordial soup on your plate.  Bursting with flavorful morsels of sausage and beef.  The perfect hangover cure, and by that I mean that if you're hungover, go stuff yourself with this meal and you'll want to die, but at least not because of the alcohol you drank.  Everyone wins, kinda.

Note: at 11, they no longer serve breakfast and who wants lunch after what I just explained to you?  Although I did have a croissant club sandwich and it was very respectable!  Just not, you know, chicken fried steak.

There sometimes is a wait.  Deal.  Because if you're looking for a greasy spoon, you just found it."}
{"text":"First time there, had green chili pork burritio.  Phenomenal.  My wife had the chicken fried steak burrito.  It was also phenomenal.

Great breakfast selection, everything looked amazing, big portions, decent prices, and an awesome staff.  Plus, you get to watch airplanes come and go while you eat.

5 Stars for sure.  And we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Go here every weekend. Quality staff and atmosphere. Breakfast is great, but don't sleep on lunch at Hanger. The Greek menu options are great."}
{"text":"This was my second time here.  Each time we had to wait a short while because the place is small but very popular for breakfast.   And breakfast did not disappoint.  I had just the basics.  Eggs, hash browns, pancakes.  To be honest it all tastes the same wherever I go.   Service was very good.  Really no complaints.  We sat outside but it happened to be a cool morning with a nice breeze so we lucked out."}
{"text":"Great for kids, especially young kids. See some of my photos. It is located at Chandler small airport and kids can get up close to planes.
It does get crowded but turnover is fairly fast so wait is usually not more than 15-20 minutes. There is an upstairs balcony to get a good view of planes while waiting and the announce tables over loud speaker so it is easy to hear.
The food is very good both for adults and kids. I had a hard time finding an online menu so see my pictures. Burritos are pretty good size and plates in general are good size, even for someone who eats at buffets as much as I do
Many people ride bikes to the place."}
{"text":"If the second meal was my first meal I would not have gone back for a second meal.  The hamburger did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! A little difficult to find but it's worth the detour. The food is delicious and hash browns for breakfast are a must for me. The cinnamon roll is scrumptious! The service is friendly but a bit inattentive. The view tops the experience and I recommend visiting during the week for a more relaxed experience."}
{"text":"Airplanes AND a delicious breakfast?! Yes, please.
I came here for breakfast one saturday morning with my dad and as he drove up I wasn't sure he knew where he was actually going (which happens often). But as we headed down a one way street, around a corner, and smack in the middle of Chandler Airport there was the Hanger Cafe. Kids and adults alike will love this place.   You get to watch the airplanes taxi, take off, and land all while enjoying a homemade cafe style meal. Five minutes in my dad and I were already deep into our airplane talk! 

While deciding on what to order my pops and I both decided to have some coffee. The coffee was good. Nothing crazy but let me tell you, the servers put a new meaning on the phrase \"bottomless cup\"! I'm not sure if our cups were ever less than half full (or half empty I guess, depending on how your day is going). Ok, I ordered the Green Chili Breakfast Burrito and as it was brought out my server told me I made a great choice and that it was her favorite. I dont know why but this always makes me feel good inside. Like my own little pat on the back from someone in the know. Well, she wasn't wrong. The burrito is loaded with scrambled eggs, amazing beans and a few green chillies. But the best part was the green chili sauce that is smothered over the top. I gobbled that thing up so fast I barely had time to ask my dad how his ginormous pancakes, eggs and sausage were. He said they were great and they looked it too. I'm taking 10-12 inchers! 

All in all, the food was great, service was perfect and luckily we arrived early enough that there wasn't a wait. Come with or without the kids. Breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The rave reviewers were right! We were greeted as we opened the door. My girlfriend wasn't hungry, but that changed when our server mentioned Cinnamon Rolls. She liked their iced tea and I enjoyed an Arnold Palmer. While she attacked the frosted cinnamon roll, I had the Biscuits and gravy, with hash browns covered in sauteed onions and bell peppers, and two eggs. It was all very delicious. Courtesy and service was beyond excellent. This was the third regional airport cafe we've eaten at in the past year. All 5 star rated. I think we're onto something here. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I dont know how people know of this place because it is very tucked away in this small airport, you wouldnt think that there was a restaurant here! 

Anyway, this is a fun place to go to for breakfast or lunch, kids would love it. You can enjoy good food and look out the window at all the planes too. Maybe even catch some landing or taking off. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very casual, they have some great plane-related decor that is fun to look at!

Our plan was to go here for breakfast, but our day started past noon so we missed the breakfast menu. Oops. Thats okay, we still got lunch! I had the buffalo chicken salad. Their house dressing is delish. I was aiming for the healthier lunch route but that quickly went down the drain with the delicious cheese soaked bread that came with it! My boyfriend got a wrap of sorts, which looked good too! Two thumbs up for \"airport\" food, haha!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! I ordered the hash burrito and my husband ordered the airport burrito. He liked his and I tasted it, too. Both really good!! The seating was tight, but it was Sunday at 11am. We were sat pretty quickly and the service was good."}
{"text":"A great place. Fantastic service, fantastic food! Like a home cooked meal. Very cool to see the planes and watch take offs and landings as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had breakfast there at least 100 times. You have to know where it is (at the chandler airport). Expect a wait, but not a long one. And if you're an aviation nut like me (and pilot), the setting is perfect."}
{"text":"Its your basic breakfast fare so what could you possibly complain about. The location is pretty cool where you can watch people prep and take off in their little private planes. The staff is really friendly. The food took longer to come out but i the place was packed so in my opinion thats totally forgivable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go.  It is like going back in time and super great food and service.  Seeing planes come and go is really cool.  Will be sure to visit again.  We had breakfast our first visit may try lunch next."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good here, but a bit pricey for what we got. My whole party had breakfast and it was quick, food was hot, but no real wow factor on flavor. I would recommend if you are in the area and just want a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"What a great little quaint place. I met a friend there today for a cup of coffee. Waitresses never let your cup sit empty :)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere for the kids! Very packed and loud though. But the food is Great! Service is amazing they really get you in and out without feeling rushed!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim since I was looking for a cool place to eat as a visitor from out of state. Hangar cafe was the perfect and adorable fit! We sat on the enclosed patio just a few feet from a line of pond jumpers. The food is expected diner faire and is prepared well and timely. The decor doesn't disappoint either with their charming vintage vibe. My sister who lives in town had never been there either and we were both delighted to have checked out this charming gem. A little hard to find since it's literally on the Tarmac, but for sure worth the effort. The service is also really amazing and the all around friendly home town vibe warmed our heart as much as the food warmed our tummy. My only regret is that I can't hop in that plane next to me and fly home ;D"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Just went there today and had a bacon cheeseburger and it was soooo good. The staff was really nice will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My son loves airplanes so we went here for breakfast on Sunday. It was a perfect spot for us. The planes pull right up to the cafe and park. The food was great. We had the spinach and feta cheese omelette and French toast. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for the planes but we will be back for the food. We thought it would be fun for the kids to watch the planes take off and land and it was but the food was a surprise. The chorizo burrito burned the hair off ass. (That's a compliment) usually when a the menu indicates spicy it shows up with minimal heat but the hangar cafe does it right. The kids loved the pancakes and French toast too! It's also cool to watch the planes takeoff and land while you eat."}
{"text":"Update: we came back for breakfast. My husband said the pancakes were hands down the best he's EVER had! The hash brown were buttery and excellent too. That being said, the eggs in the omelette were paper thin. I'd recommend getting eggs and bacon instead."}
{"text":"This is a solid cafe serving solid food in a little corner of a private airport.  Definitely a neat place to take your kids.  The Western burger I had hit the spot and fries were definitely decent.  

Its nothing fancy and its not the best food I've ever had - but they have a solid offering at a cool spot."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast... The food is awesome and the service is efficient.There Is usually a pretty good wait to be seated but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"At the request of a friend I was invited to breakfast at the Hanger Grill at the Chandler, AZ Airport.  Knowing that this is our municipal airport and that it is primarily a home for local pilots and aircraft, I was a bit apprehensive about breakfast at this restaurant.  Having an aviation background I gave in to at least look at the local inventory of private air frames.  
When we arrived I found the place to a bit crowded with clientele.  The menu look interesting and the prices were not bad.  Once the food came I knew why there were people standing waiting for a table.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs.  It was wonderful.  The service was excellent, the coffee great and the quantity of food more than enough.  My friend had the bacon and eggs with potatoes.  He have 5 large strips of bacon and plenty of food.  All in all, this is a place I will return to in the futures.  Sometimes the out of the way and relatively unknown establishments turn out to be a good find.  This is a place worth trying."}
{"text":"First time here and we were extremely pleased with the entire experience! Arrived around 7:30am on a Weds to find several dinners enjoying their meal. Staff welcomed us and allowed us to choose any table. All three servers were nicely choreographed as they continuously touched our table filling our coffee and checking on further needs. Fun diner atmosphere with kitschy sayings posted everywhere. Airplane-themed naturally fits into their setting. We enjoyed the basic faire of eggs and ham with hash browns and toast. All excellently prepared as was the flavorful coffee! Around 8:30 the cafe was hopping although no one had to wait long for a table.

We'd highly recommend this breakfast place for the friendly, attentive service and good food!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant at Chandler Municipal Airport. The service and food is good. We enjoyed Mediterranean sandwiches of eggs, spinach, feta and tomato on whole wheat muffins. We also liked the cornbeef hash. Coffee refills poured as we watched small aircraft land and take off. We recommend this restaurant. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"You can smell something delicious before you enter this restaurant and it ain't airplane fumes. This tiny, but very crowded  restaurant is fill with very happy people eating large portions of what looks like food that my mama use to make.  Our waitress Amy was  very friendly and was at our table in less than 2 minutes after we sat down.  Amy came back multiple time to make sure we were okay, even though she was extremely busy. Lets start with the coffee. Wonderful not bitter severed very hot.   I ordered the spinach and feta cheese omelette. It was really good but the omelette would had been a little better if it spinach was in smaller pieces.  My husband had the gyro omelette and he was in heaven.  after our meal we went up outside up stairs where a few tables are located to watch the planes.  It was very relaxing and good to know we found a new gem."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Chandler. The food is great and the place is fun. Friendly servers and patrons. I think I'll go there tomorrow for a Denver Omelette!"}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after noon and unfortunately were told that the breakfast menu was just ending. I should have taken this as a sign of things to come because lunch was mediocre at best. Lunch is not their strong suit. I will attempt to come back for breakfast based on strong reviews. My party ordered different things from the cheeseburger to the fish and I had the meatloaf plate. The potatoes tasted like they had just been combined with water and whipped in a pan in the back of the store and were not fresh mashed potatoes at all. The meatloaf was thin and lacking of any real flavor. The fish was salty and greasy.  The only upside was the friendly service, aviation decor, and a chance to see planes up close."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant to \"see\" the planes take off and land.  One came in today.  Now, about the food.  Does \"greasy spoon\" bring anything to mind?  I ordered a chicken salad.  I'm not sure if the chicken was boiled or old or what.  But it had a bad taste AND it was like rubber.  The \"greens\" were old as well.   There is also very little parking close.  So, if walking is a problem, get there early and hope for the best.  But seriously, I would advise you to \"Stay away\" from this Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Want a great little caf√©!  Wait staff was very attentive and overall on top of things. Our little girl loved watching the planes take off while she enjoyed her pancakes!  The chicken fried steak is a must have with hash browns. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Normally a great spot for breakfast, today's experience has moved the Hangar Cafe a few notches down on our list.  The place was busy when we arrived - we waited for about 15 minutes for a 2-top.  We were quickly greeted and asked if we wanted coffee.  We said yes, and then waited ...  Finally another waitress came over and asked if we'd been helped, we said \"yes\", but were waiting for coffee.  The 2nd waitress produced coffee in a timely manner.  The second waitress took our order, then we waited.  After waiting about 15-20 minutes (the cafe was busy), we noticed our order had been placed on the serving counter by the cook.  The first waitress finally served the food, which by this time was less than hot, but looked ok except for the burned hashbrowns (normally they are quite beautiful).  At that time I requested a little more gravy for my hashbrowns.  The gravy never arrived, and  I think the manager brought us our bill.  After leaving, my wife said she found some frozen hashbrowns in her serving of the blackened potatoes.  They were busy, but in an effort to quickly produce a product, the quality suffered.  We'll try the place one more time, but if not up to par, then we'll, reluctantly, move on."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new weekend breakfast place and this is it.  This place has it all.  Atmosphere, service and good food.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  My coffee or water glass never went below half.  The food came quickly and was very good.  The place is definitely old school diner like, but with the added fun of the airport setting.  I will see you there next Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! The food is delicious and alway consistent! If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land! Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed! Best breakfast spot in C-town. However the service isn't the best... But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots..."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place around, and their lunch is good too! Awesome drink deals, food is all made to order and always hot. I've never been disappointed by a single thing I've ordered here."}
{"text":"Food was ok, about average for a greasy spoon restaurant. The restaurant itself is small and the tables are crammed in pretty tight, service was great and the kids loved watching the airplanes. We went for breakfast, but I imagine it's less hectic for lunch. There's a rooftop patio where you can take your food up and eat/ watch planes but in the heat that's no bueno."}
{"text":"You don't find many old-school, diner-style restaurants around. Hangar Cafe is certainly one of them though. The only thing this place is missing are the bad attitude, hoarse-voiced waitresses calling you \"hon\"...and that's a good thing.

Hearty, stick-to-your-ribs breakfasts: 3-egg omelets, corned beef hash, bacon & eggs...and they're generous with the hashbrowns too. You probably won't leave hungry. The quality of the food is a little spotty though--having been the recipient of lukewarm food on at least one occasion. And, the coffee is unfortunately also \"diner style,\" weak and bitter (avoid)."}
{"text":"Great place, right at the Chandler Municipal Airport. Total diner style food although I do wish they served breakfast the whole time they are open."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast great service! The gyro omelet is excellent. How they get eggs to taste like a real geek gyro is magic. Place is pretty small but they accommodate. Definitely a must for kids of all ages. You literally don't want to leave the view of planes taking off and landing. The patio is heated and cool in the warmer months."}
{"text":"A friend recommended that I take my 3 year old daughter here for breakfast. I took the advice, and couldn't be happier that I did! The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly, too. The kiddo really enjoyed watching the planes, too. I've already told several friends and family members about this place. I've been in AZ for over 8 years and had no idea it existed until last week. I'm glad I know now!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a breakfast/brunch spot!! We cannot wait to go back. We met some friends here that had been raving to us about it for a while and we are so happy that we finally made it out there. They had quite a bit of a wait, but we were expecting that and it felt a lot shorter because we got to watch all the planes taking off and landing. The toddlers in our group were in heaven! Once we were seated we were taken care of right away and they were pretty good on our drink refills. All the food we had was really good and we look forward to going back and trying some more. After breakfast we went up to their rooftop overlook and enjoyed watching the planes some more as the kids worked off their energy from the chocolate chip pancakes. Great food, great staff, and great atmosphere, you cannot ask for much more!"}
{"text":"A cute little gem of a restaurant hidden at the Chandler Airport.  Normally an airport is not where I would suggest someone eat, but this restaurant is great.  So far I have stopped by every time I have visited the area.  They have a nice sized menu (the Airport Burrito, basically a chicken fried chicken breakfast burrito, it yummy!), they service is quick and they have a lot of seating inside and a nice patio outside.  And you get to see planes come and go while you eat.  It makes for a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"An airport location?

My little cutie pie and hubby likes to come here just to watch the Cessna planes land and take off.  The onsite cafe may not have much of an ambiance in itself, but the view of the small planes make up for it.  The food and service are inconsistent, thus the three stars.

We came here on a Sunday with a reservation for a party of twelve.  Even with a reservation, we still had to wait an hour to be seated and another thirty-five minutes for ice water out in the patio and it was a scorcher out there!

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash with a side of crispy hash browns, over easy eggs and sourdough toast.  This is the very first time I have ever not ordered coffee with my full breakfast.  The canned corned beef was not worth the wait and it was almost lunch time by the time we got our food.  Now I'm craving for some real corned beef!  My little cutie pie settled on bagel with cream cheese in those single serving plastic packets...my pet peeve!  It's a freakin' sit down cafe, for crying out loud!  Hubby got the Breakfast Chorizo Burrito, was pretty good.  The orange juice was from a plastic bottle or frozen concentrate.  The KID MENU had pancakes or waffles with a side of eggs and bacon or sausage.  It was a pretty good size.  My friend's chicken fried steak with a side of biscuits and gravy, was not bad at all.  

The servers are really nice, but sometimes they seem disorganized when it comes to timing with getting our drinks and food out.  

We'd probably be regulars if it wasn't for the so-so food and spotty service.  We'll still be back because the boys just love airplanes!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast with the kids, great food and extremely friendly staff. My grandson absolutely loved watching the planes. Don't miss this place, A number one and I wish I could give it  stars !"}
{"text":"No better local spot for breakfast or lunch. Owners are phenomenal, staff been there a long time and live their jobs and it shows in their food!"}
{"text":"I love taking my boys here. They are 18 months old and they love watching the planes fly in and out. I've ordered a couple of different dishes, but my favorite is the Dutch with jalape√±os. Solid food, cute atmosphere, good service, entertaining window action."}
{"text":"Breakfast as good as it gets. Been coming here for 10 years and never been disappointed. Lunch while not looking as good as breakfast is surprising good just not as good as breakfast. Give it a try , great service plus watch a plane or two take off and land. Much better than the big breakfast chains."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the Hangar Caf√© for years.  It's s amazing how popular it has become.  They have a great breakfast and lunch menu.  You'll feel like you're in a diner from the 60's. If nothing else take your kids for the experience of watching the planes fly in and out of Chandler Municipal Airpark."}
{"text":"Omelets are fantastic! Big and fluffy with lots of options. Hash browns included too. This place always has great food and service. Best hidden gem in Chandler. Great for kids to see the planes."}
{"text":"We ate here Sunday for breakfast. Of course it was crowded and VERY stuffy and super loud. We were sat by the window, with the blinds up so people can see the planes take off and it was hot and uncomfortable. We waited a while for our food but unfortunately the heat and stuffiness of being by the window kind of ruined the breakfast. It is still too hot out to have the blinds up and not enough cool air circulating. We were a larger party so we had no where else to sit. And my sister's step daughter found a small hair in her food. YUCK!! Perhaps we went on a bad day, Sundays appear to be the worst almost anywhere and this is no exception."}
{"text":"A mommy friend suggested to come here after school w/ our 2 preschoolers one Friday afternoon.  Once the boys saw all the parked planes they were super excited.  We chose to sit close to the window to get the best view of the planes (too warm to sit in the patio).

This cafe serves the typical mom & pop diner food with most of the menu items around $7.95.   I didn't expect great food here but my tuna melt w/ cheese (3.5*) tasted better than it looked.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HYuqGAyy3R-B8CcUTkEfhA?select=grg84AF3qf1dCuaeVH9PHQ

Though only 3-4 planes took off or landed, my friend said to come back on the weekends to see more action."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and the service was great too. It's a very nice relaxing atmosphere and you can enjoy the surroundings as well."}
{"text":"What a find!  Great little place to enjoy a delicious breakfast and watch vintage planes (classic model planes hang from the ceiling) at the Chandler Muni Airport.  The servers are friendly and efficient.  Regulars are greeted by name.  I'll certainly be back for more of these perfect, blueberry pancakes....."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other weekend for breakfast to give it another try. Was a bit of a wait, but the food and service was well worth it."}
{"text":"I was deciding between 3 and 4 stars for this restaurant, but I like to weight food quality more than other factors, so that is what led to this rating. I ordered the veggie omelette, and my guest ordered the spinach and feta. The omelettes were fine. I had plenty of cheese and vegetables in mine. The low rating is due to there being much better breakfast places in the East Valley (Chompies, NCounter, etc...). 

The service was great. My coffee cup was never empty. Also, it may just be me, but huge plus for a breakfast place to let you pay for the meal at your table. I always thought that it was a little unusual and unnecessary that you have to take your check to the front at many breakfast spots.

There is also a hangar attached where you can walk through and look at the planes. Overall, I had a positive experience here."}
{"text":"Sweet little place in middle of Chandler airport. 

Ordered a veggie wrap with fries. Waitress was kind enough to follow-up things on table. The wrap did not amuse me though. It had some under cooked falafel I guess.

Nice place to just get out of city traffic and have a peaceful brunch.

Fries here are the best. Really crispy on outside. This is my 3.5/5 place."}
{"text":"Good enough food, but kinda slow.  The worst part ... extra, extra, extra. I had an omelette off the menu.  Hash browns - extra.  Cheese and onions on those?  extra, extra ... like $1 each.  OJ ... coffee.  Turned out to be a $21 breakfast for one before tip ... and I even tipped $6.  But I won't be back."}
{"text":"All I have to say is when a mother decides to go to a place to watch airplanes and have breakfast with her kid on Mother's Day and the place says they don't slow down till after 1130 so you show up and noon and sign in to find out you had to be signed in before noon to get breakfast so I decided to leave but then realized my family was already signed in at 1150 yay!!! Right... Nope refused to make me breakfast on Mother's Day!! I finally found something on the lunch menu but the server never took my order... ON MOTHERS DAY!!!! That's all I'm going to say."}
{"text":"Very authentic diner style food.  We enjoy this place mostly because it s a serious hidden hideaway place.  And it is amazing for kids."}
{"text":"My friend Amanda introduced me to this spot 10 years ago when it was a total local spot where the old timers and a small community of people in the know, knew about.  Well the word has gotten out over years.  It's a solid breakfast option for SoCha.  The spot is a total greasy spoon with standard breakfast affair.  Chorizo or Denver omelet are both filling and solid choices.  Looking for something to satisfy your sweet tooth?  The pancakes and French toast will do the trick.  Four thumbs up from my two girls.  Hash browns are always solid with a nice crust from the flat top.  Gourmet? No.  Just classic breakfast affair done fairly well at a reasonable price.  I did mention greasy spoon, right?  They are a big fan of butter, lots of butter.  FYI, they have recently raised their prices.  Most items are now closer to $8 to $9 versus $5 to $7 price point in the past.  Kids menu still $5.  If you are going there on the weekends, go early, because they place fills up quickly.  In my opinion, it's a gem in Chandler.  Where else can you walk pass airplane hangers and watch planes take off and land?  If Yelp would allow  1/2 stars, this would qualify for 3.5 stars, not quite 4.0."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise on a Sunday afternoon. The service was excellent; friendly and fast. Had the Mushroom burger and I was very happy with my choice. Great atmosphere and a big hit for the kids."}
{"text":"It was my first visit. The food was really good. We went on a busy Sunday morning. The only reason I gave it a 4 stars is because the wait time was not comfortable. There were not comfortable seats under shade available at all. So the long wait sitting on flimsy chairs in the full sun was difficult."}
{"text":"For me, when I'm craving a good 'ol breakfast like eggs, pancakes and hash browns,  the Hangar Cafe has all the staple menu items.  I recently had a Denver Omelet that really hit the spot.   Saturday and Sunday mornings can be busy so you might have to wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice location on airport runway. On my Sunday morning bike ride stopped in to check out joint. Great customer service but really packed. Huevos ranchers were  uniquely  prepared. More like Mexican American style with hash browns rather than rice. The green sause was delicious. Great for bike stop dive. Did not drink but they have a bar for morning alchi's..."}
{"text":"Great prices and great food! Place was packed!!! The wait for our order wasn't bad at all!!"}
{"text":"This was a perfect place to go for a breakfast meal with my wife. We loved to watch the planes & helicopters take off! Would recommend it to at least check it out!"}
{"text":"Hanger Cafe is one of the best secrets in Chandler.  The location is really cool at the airport and the plates are huge.  Service gets a little tricky when busy, but it is a good mix of traditional American breakfast with Southwest flair.  Omelets are fantastic as are the home fries and pancakes.  Check this place out... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is located at the Chandler Municipal Airport and is essentially right next to where all the planes sit. You will see planes move around as you enjoy your meal. I thought it was a cool experience, but aside from that, the only other redeeming factor was the customer service!

I went on a Saturday morning, and it was packed! We waited about 15 minutes to get seated, which was pretty good. There is not a hostess at this place. You claim your place in line by writing your name down on a paper. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The building interior and furniture is on the older side. The place is loud and cramped. It definitely has a diner feel to it. Once we were seated, our waitress came to our service right away. Throughout the whole time, she was very helpful and accommodating. Few of my friends came late, and she was on top of getting the food ordered quickly. Despite how busy it was, our server remained calm the entire time. Customer service gets an A+.

The food: they serve the usual breakfast items and have a handful of special items. They do charge $1.00 up-charge for egg whites and another $1.00 for fruit. I'm not a fan of that...Portion size is pretty large, and price is pretty affordable. Overall food was good but nothing that would stand out in my memory.

To sum up the cool parts: planes and customer serivce.

I would definitely bring people here for this unique experience, but it's not notable enough to frequent regularly."}
{"text":"We arrived just after breakfast ended (and for this kind of restaurant breakfast should really go until the place closes), lunch was clearly not their forte. The lunch foods were okay, but definitely not amazing or savory. People who have not had a true 5-star burger would probably love their burgers, but having had hob√™ burgers, these burgers were clearly inferior. The atmosphere was perfectly friendly, but if they had made their lunch food with more care, it would have boosted my rating."}
{"text":"GARLIC MAYO

Add it to your sandwich. Was completely surprised when a client requested we ate here. It was very good and felt like a home town cafe. I really enjoyed the fries as well."}
{"text":"Seriously this place was fun. Kids got to watch planes take off and land while we had breakfast. The food itself was fast and tasted awesome. my wife had a green Chile burro that was amazing, and I had the corned beef and hash burro with green sauce. It seemed like a risk, but it was amazing. The kids loved their traditional pancakes and frech toast plates. portions were huge. Staff was friendly. Definitely worth the trip, would go again."}
{"text":"Hangar Cafe is a fun family time!  Watching the planes is really neat.  Really need to come by for the experience. 

You really need to get there early or experience a wait time.

It's good, old fashioned, heart warming food!  It is not gluten friendly."}
{"text":"The Hanger Cafe is not what you'd call \"upscale\". In fact, if you go, you'll more likely be dining alongside farmers and local businessmen than Beautiful People. 

However, if you enjoy an old-time \"greasy spoon\" you will likely love Hanger. It serves prime chicken fried steak, hamburgers, and about two dozen varieties of sandwiches including Rueben, Philly Steak and BLT. 

The other -- and more compelling -- reason to visit the Hangar Cafe is that it is a prime spot for airplane watching. The little cafe is housed in an old airplane hanger on the northwest side of Chandler Municipal Airport. The best spot for rating the take offs and landings is a table on the patio."}
{"text":"I am an airshow pilot and based at Chandler.  I have been coming to the Hangar Cafe for nearly 20 years.  Great food, family fun, and airplanes.  What a great combo!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, dinner, it doesn't matter what time you go, the Hangar Cafe is delicious. They have to put something special in their hash browns to make them taste so AMAZING. It takes a little long to get the food, but you know it's fresh because they cook it right in front of you."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid. Food is always fantastic and staff is only the best of the best. Great environment and you can see the airplanes take off and land with the occasional flyby. They do have a top deck for outside seating."}
{"text":"My favorite \"go to\" breakfast place.  There portions are large and tasty.  The service is quick and the wait staff is attentive.  The atmosphere of the airport is fun and great for kids."}
{"text":"I know, I know, being a bit harsh if you like them. Unfortunately for me,  I am not crazy into airplanes like some people forgive me.  I was hoping their food would outshine the environment all together.  It is also unfortunate for them that both my boyfriend and myself cook and normally make our food 110% amazing every time (not to brag) when we put our all into it.  With that being said,  We are Huge foodie critics  and don't try to be hard on others it just happens when you cook and bake as much as us.  Sorry, our apologies.  We waited for at least a solid 30-60 minutes for a table standing in the wind, listening to annoying teenagers scream and be stupid like they always are( just being honest), having obnoxious children bump into you and scream and cry all over and not being watched by their parents, oh and my absolute favorite the people who have no sense of personal space.  If you have not caught onto my sarcasm I feel extremely sorry for you.  :)

As we finally got called to our table I chose oh so wrong on place to sit, I wish I would have been thinking more clearly that sitting with my back to the entry was the worst decision I had made for the beginning of my day.  Why? because I had a grandma and her two grandchildren bump into me as I attempted to drink my water in peace, so I had to constantly lean in towards my boyfriend looking at me all strange because he knows how much I Love people i don't know bumping me and getting that close.  We order our food and comes out maybe in 15-20 minutes,  My boyfriend ordered a burrito with hash browns on the side with some amazing salsa(the only thing that tasted absolutely amazing to me)  that had a hair in the hash browns and right under the salsa cup. LOVELY! -(only caps word ill use since I am getting heavily annoyed with reviewers typing LIKE this within EVERY other WORD)

My chicken fried steak was nothing amazing to me only because I have a horrid habit of making it almost every weekend. Like I said Horrid habit!  Then the over easy eggs is another mistake I made because I always forget how I make my version of over easy is not the same as restaurant over easy which means extra runny egg whites and yolks. I love the yolks part but cant get over how runny egg whites tend to be every time I make that silly mistake.

Oh well, Another breakfast place checked off my list and on to the next one!

**FREEDOM OF SPEECH Is the 1st amendment. Please look it up. I have the right to my opinion just like everyone else. Don't harass me just because I wasn't blown away people. Geezus."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Love their breakfast menu - especially the burritos with hash. Everything is made fresh and hot. It's busy so plan on a wait, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good! Diner food, nothing super special but very simple.  I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Excellent for kids; good service. Don't forget to go upstairs to the outdoor observation deck. Also, visitors are welcome into the hanger next to the restaurant to see airplanes up close - another very fun thing for children and adults!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family to surprise my 2.5 year old son (he's on a airplane kick lately). We ordered the biscuits and belgian waffle combination. It was really good and the views of the planes taking off and landed were great. Their hash browns are also very tasty. 

Overall, a great place if you want to take the family for breakfast and watch some airplanes. I think my only issue (not a huge one though) is the pricing is higher than that of other breakfast food places. I believe this is likely due to the venue being in a prime location. Friendly service really was a cherry on top."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in Chandler. I love their biscuits and gravy, so good! Usually pretty busy especially Saturday and Sunday mornings but never waited too long for a seat or for our food."}
{"text":"What a great place this is! Location is on the property of the Chandler Airport. If you can, get a table out on the patio so you can watch the planes come in and out. The food? As good as the view! Four of us had breakfast here so each of us got something different. Going around the table everyone loved their meal.  My mom ordered the Mediterranean sandwich which comes on an English muffin and she remarked that it was a perfect amount of food and oh so tasty! They offer hashbrowns and cubed potatoes and we tried both. I really recommend the hashbrowns. Cooked perfectly! They are only open til 2pm and breakfast only til noon so schedule accordingly! 

All and all this is a great place with fun views and a must try!!"}
{"text":"Super random but super cute, friendly and delicious! Service was really great for a busy Sunday morning breakfast! Great find and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lively vibe here with many locals. Outside shaded seating too. Staff attentive, quick and friendly.

Menu vast and has a Mexican flair with old school diner. Chicken fried steak breakfast burrito? I think so! 

Food was phenomenal, well seasoned and definitely fresh. A go to again for sure!"}
{"text":"Cute little place... awful food and awful service though. Our server hardly acknowledged us and we had to wait about 20 min for our bill. There were two tables in the whole restaurant and plenty servers so I don't know what the hang up was."}
{"text":"Perfect place to bring the family and sit on the deck watching planes.  Enjoy a huge warm cinnamon bun with a cup of coffee!  Service is always excellent.  Portions are generous.  Diner-type breakfast in a memorable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whatever you've read before about \"at least the food is good\" is gone! I've been eating there for a while. It was good before. The last two times l have been there, IT HAS GONE WAY DOWN HILL, just within the last month. Our whole group agreed. Much smaller portions, cheap on the ingredients and the waitresses have more attitude.
I don't know if they have gotten overconfident because people line up to get in, but, that will stop very soon. Yeah food cost more because fuel cost is up. Why are so many joints, just to save a buck, cutting quality. They don't think people are going to stop eating there?
 I say, Cya!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast have been there about 10x now & the food is always good with big proportions. Nice variety of choices on their menu along with specials. Staff is always friendly & gives you great service. Not a fancy place its a small place but being at the airport makes it unique."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at The Hangar Cafe!  Thanks Shannon for Super Service!  This is our favorite Sunday morning stop for home cooking, generous portions and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My third time there. 
Never been disappointed.   I don't know the area very well.  I lined in chandler few months. And find out about that place true yelp.    
Food is great.  Service is good.   I will keep going there any time I am in chandler.   The food is good.  It's get very busy over the weekends.   

A bit hard to find the place.  It's behind the small local school airport"}
{"text":"Food was just average - the airport if definitely the attraction. Their service was friendly and quick. We went for lunch and had hamburgers, fries, fried mac and cheese balls (definitely weren't what I was expecting). The food was good but just good- there are many better burger and fry options out there but it was an experience my children enjoyed immensely."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday morning and expected a wait, especially for a party of 9.  But after waiting 45 minutes, I checked our status and host told me there are only 2 tables that could fit us and they were just sitting down.  I told him to separate us to 6/3 or 5/4 and he nodded.  After 2 hours of waiting, we finally sit down with no menus and no water.  Waited another 10 minutes before a waitress came by.  We ordered and 1/2 our party had to run and asked for their food to go, only to find it our order hasn't even been started yet.  They cancel and leave.  The rest of us get our food and it was a huge disappointment.  I had steak and eggs, both were over cooked and dry.  Steak was such bad quality.  Fruit was old.  Everyone's meals were not spectacular and not worth the wait at all.  We wasted nearly 3 hours of our lives on this meal.  UGH."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place for brunch! Great menu, prices are great, and who doesn't love watching airplanes take off and land while enjoying a meal? Pancakes are hugs and so so yummy!! The service was awesome and even the decor around the cafe is quite and quaint. Loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"This is a good airport cafe that is very popular with local community.  Very crowded in the winter months on the weekends.  If you are flying in, it's a short walk from transient parking or the few parking spots next to fuel pumps. Auto parking can be limited.  Keep in mind this is an active airport with moving aircraft, proceed with caution and do not let kids run unsupervised.  
The food is pretty standard airport cafe food.  You can't go wrong with any of the basics.  They do offer a Mediterranean section which is ok. I tried the Gyro plate and it was not quite what I expected. The gyro meet was cooked like bacon in consistency and look. Not like shaved gyro meat.  The \"Pita\" seemed more like a tortilla and was way overcooked, I did not get more than a bite or two before it was crisp.  I applaud the effort to diversify the menu but it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I'll stick with the standard type offerings in the future.  Service is quick and my glass was never more than half empty."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! Funny to take my kids to so they can see the planes take off and land. It's great because my family can fly into this airport to see us for quick visits. Food is always Hot! Sometimes it's really busy. Just have to be patient."}
{"text":"This is definitely a family, friendly place. Pretty much right on the runway @ The Chandler Airport. You can watch planes take off and land. There is typically a wait and you can go upstairs on the viewing deck and get a better view of thw airpark. Food is great, servers/staff great and friendly too. Been here about three times in the past 8 yrs or so (kinda forgot about it) and will definitely be back more!"}
{"text":"It's a caf√©, really clean, great food and two weeks ago (June '15) when I tried to go there with friends they were closed for a remodel. It's a fun atmosphere with friendly staff.."}
{"text":"I can imagine sitting here years ago and seeing beyond the landing strips to....nothing but fields and dairies!  It's old school no doubt (no lattes and cappuccino's here) but great in every way.  Typical greasy spoon diner food served by authentically beehive hairdo'd waitresses.  FYI The omelets can serve three people."}
{"text":"The food here was decent but the experience makes it very worth the trip. Especially if you have younger kids that like airplanes. The way that I saw children's faces light up made my day. Not to mention it was probably some of the friendliest staff at any place that I've ever dined!"}
{"text":"They would not sit our party of eight together 
...the waitress would not put two tables that were right next to each other together.   At the very least they could of brought out our food together...nope they couldn't do that either.  Ours came out at least 10 minutes later so the people we were with had to wait for us to finish.  Bad customer service and very overrated. The food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"First time here today for early lunch. Very good chow. I had a green chile burrito and peach cobbler dessert. All quite good. Great service with friendly staff throughout. Nice airport/flying crowd atmosphere. Just right. I plan to return."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, American food, Friendly staff, all well watching small aircraft taking off and landing. Love this place, it's a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun!  It is the right combination of greasy spoon and quality, filled with what look to be regulars hanging out.  It is located right on the Chandler Municipal Airport, watching little airplanes is super fun.  Breakfasts seem pretty standard, delicious and not remarkably healthy.  

When I came back for lunch yesterday, I was astounded to discover one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had.  This was the last place I would have expected to find a veggie burger, much less a really, really good one.

With think fries and attentive service, this place is fun and delicious!  The fact that I go there anytime my boyfriend is up for it and it's about a 30 minute drive from home is indicative of how awesome it is."}
{"text":"Great Brunch place especially if you love to watch airplanes, with great service and great food! Diner type seating inside with tables, booths, and they have outdoor patio seating. 

I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. The portions was big and the side of bacon was lot I was happy. It was thick perfectly cooked crispy bacon, the gravy and the biscuits delicious.

If you sit outside in patio area which we did your right next to the tarmac where planes park and taxy off, you can smell the fumes but it's fun the pilots wave to the diners. 

They also have a 2nd floor viewing area, you can watch planes take off and land while you wait for your table, and on a beautiful day you have great views of the mountains and planes! You can also explore the hangar next to the cafe where they have planes you can view!

Highly recommend, come early because it does get busy!"}
{"text":"3.5 for experience. It's a great diner and atmosphere is fitting. Overall good grease spoon but don't expect anything special/different from a quality of good perspective."}
{"text":"Great little spot-took out if town guests here for breakfast and they loved it!  Breakfast menu was big and had plenty to choose from.  Airplanes kept the little ones entertained too,which is always great!"}
{"text":"It's great to watch the planes come in. You can even walk around in the hangar. The prices are good and the portions are large. My food was a little cool but it was really busy. It is often busy and might be a wait to get a seat since it is a small place. It's a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast, with a neat experience to see aircraft taxi, takeoff, and land. If you have little ones, this is a perfect spot to spend the morning. I took the family for the first time today and the experience was awesome. We arrived around 8:45a and it was already busy- there's plenty of parking near and around the cafe. There's a sign-in sheet to get in queue for a table but the owner quickly seated us as we walked inside the small restaurant. The theme is obviously aircraft, very simple place but cozy and clean. 

First of all, the staff is amazing. Our coffee cups were NEVER empty (or even half full for that matter) and our server visited our table frequently to check in on us, amidst the chaos and crowds. The food was excellent- we had the pancake breakfast and it's a ton of food for the $8 price (2 giant pancakes, 2 eggs and sausage/bacon). There's a great kids menu for $4 a plate and plenty of food. I was tempted to try a burrito since most Yelpers recommended them but I was in a pancake mood. We left the place very full and content. 

We then stood outdoors for about 30 minutes to watch the planes come and go. Our 3-year old loved it. On the walk back to the SUV we peeked into a hangar and saw several aircraft being maintenanced. A worker waved us in and we got to get up close and personal with several prop planes- super cool. It was a great photo opp for us and our kiddo loved every minute. 

We will be back for sure, this is a great family place with excellent service, good food and a separate experience to see the planes."}
{"text":"Great service. Wide selection of breakfast items. Our 3 boys love to check out the planes both while they are parked and watching them take off and land. I got the corned beef hash, haven't had a good one in a while! The hangar burrito was a hit as well as the green chile scramble that was on special. Everything was excellent, we will be back again just like many times before!!!"}
{"text":"Took my two small kids (2 and 4) here for lunch after an emissions test. The waitress was very friendly and the food was good. This was the first time we had been here, but we will definitely be back. Great local joint."}
{"text":"It's a cool place to check out planes. I was disappointed that you can't see the planes taking off while inside.  Food is good, but they rush you because there is always a line. The cleaning guys took my drink before I even stood up to leave."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here considering the flight line is right beside the cafe. Often sightings of fighter jets. A good old fashioned cheeseburger and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice little place for a relaxing meal while watching aircraft come and go.  Friendly waitstaff and good food.  Surprising variety, even Greek.  Will definitely return!

UPDATE:. Just had breakfast and it was just as good as lunch before.  Six people, all different selections, all good.

Additional: I earlier said \"not sure\" about WiFi but now confirm they DO have it.

Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Sit outside if you can to see all the planes taking off. Big portions. Yummy food!"}
{"text":"I read several reviews on Yelp before trying the Hangar. Cafe, and I was quite nervous cause some made it seem like the food was bad, but gettong to see the planes was fun so worth sitting in the noise and eating bad food etc.... I CAN NOT DISAGREE MORE. My family and I sat outside, in the heat, so we could enjoy the planes; my kids loved it!! Such a fun experience!! And the food was great!! I'm a coffee snob, and I still enjoyed my coffee ;) Our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive! Great experience!! We will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Great staff and pricing. Biscuits and gravy are to die for."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning for a business meeting and really enjoyed the entire experience. The food was great, the staff was wonderful and it was super cool to eat outside while watching the airplanes come and go!  I will definitely be coming back with my kidos."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for the first time.  I had the taco omelette with cubed potatoes, but as a twist, on the side I had the green chili, pork stew ($1.50) and used it as a gravy on the entire plate.  People who've been to Frontier in Albuquerque will know why - it was amazing!  I will return!  Don't eat at the bar, your back is then to the flight line, which is a big part of going there.  Great location!"}
{"text":"Got here at 11:05 and was told breakfast was only served till 11:00. It was to late to leave and go to our other choice. So we ordered lunch. We both ordered the gyro plate with no cucumbers. It was served with cucumbers. The gyro was only OK. The coffee was not very good so I left it and ordered a coke. Today was not a good experience. I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The 60's diner atmosphere combined with a view of the airfield is awesome."}
{"text":"Great smokey tasting Omelette's and friendly staff.  Great experience at the airport."}
{"text":"Green Chili Breakfast burrito (with pork) is fantastic!  Great, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This is a great, good ol diner.  Nothing fancy here, just a great dive diner atmosphere, great home made food, and friendly people.  This is the kind of place your always searching for, but is hard to find anymore."}
{"text":"Such a great place for breakfast.   You'll have to wait a bit (because it's good), but the staff is friendly and service is good.  Just a nice little local Chandler eatery and the bonus is watching the planes take off and land."}
{"text":"Unbelievable little place. This place is always crowded before 12:00pm and will be closed at 2:00pm. The parking is tough and the waiting is about 40 minutes if you arrive at 11:00am. 

Coffee is so-so, but the taco omelet is so delicious. Although it doesn't look like 3 eggs omelet as it claims to be, it's big enough for me. The service is a little slow, but the staff are very friendly.  No wonder it's packed with eaters. 

Even with some minor complaints about the waiting time, coffee, and parking, it is really worth to pay a visit.  I am sure to come back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a small town cafe, loved it and will go back! The food was great, the service was great, and being able to watch the airfield was the topper. I only live a few miles from here and never knew about this place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you want a cool experience come to this cafe for brunch. The service is excellent here. The food is delicious. Well priced! Very filling. I would recommend locals to take their out of state friends and family to for brunch."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast a few times and I love it! My favorite is the biscuits and gravy. I love that you can watch the planes take off and all that. Any little kid/adult who loves planes and yummy food would enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots.   
It's sits right on the run way where you can watch airplanes land and take off from the patio.  They are adjacent to an open hanger where you can walk through with your kids and see some of the planes up close.  My two girls love coming here.
This place is small so it does get very busy very quickly, but don't let the wait deter you, it is worth it.  
The service has always been excellent for me and the breakfast is always delicious.  Nothing fancy just simple breakfast done right; what more can you ask for. Recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Airport burrito, enough said.  Come with an appetite.  This big burrito filled with egg, cheese, and chicken fried steak is smothered with sausage country gravy(ask for another bowl, its that good) and be ready for awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered a Mexican omelette and my boyfriend ordered the Hangar Works. I definitely recommend either of those choices. Order the hash browns extra crispy. Yum! I also love that you can watch the little planes take off. My boyfriend is into flying and planes so it's definitely a place we both enjoy :)"}
{"text":"If you like civil aviation A/C it ok
We are at the patio and it is cramped. 
Anything over two per table on the patio is too many. 
Food is ok"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Hangar Cafe, and the first thing you'll notice (aside from the amazing views and ), is the service. Every member of the staff is extremely nice and offers to help with even the smallest of things. 

The food itself is something to write home about. This is literally as close to 'home cooking' as you can get, without going to grandma's and having her whip up a traditional breakfast right on the spot. The eggs were fried to perfection, the bacon was thick and perfectly crispy, my hash browns had just the right amount of crunchy outside to compliment the soft middle... Just writing this review makes me want to go back right now. 

Our kids wiped out their plates and were delighted to finish up brunch with the delicious pancakes that Hangar Cafe has. The wife and I opted for a Belgian waffle that was a little on the cold side when it came out to our table, but it was fantastic nonetheless. Topped with a side of fresh strawberries and whipped cream, it was a a marvelous finish to an already extremely satisfying brunch. 

Last, you can also go up the stairs to the rooftop, and take in the beautiful views surrounding the restaurant. If you're lucky, sometimes pilots will be firing up their planes or taking them out for practice runs. It's always a delight to see them putting on a quick show and taking advantage of the gorgeous scenery and clear Chandler skies."}
{"text":"The gyro plate was awesome! It is a cute place off the path a little. Great place to relax and check out the planes."}
{"text":"A small hidden gem at the (also small) Chandler Airport.  We went for breakfast on a Saturday.  It was crowded with a 30-minute wait.  There is indoor and outdoor seating--we took first available and ended up inside.  It's basically a coffee shop with good food.  I had an omelet with the potatoes, and my cousin had pancakes.  We both ate everything on our plates.  

The waitresses hustle, so diners get in and out quickly.  It's a fun place for breakfast and the food is good.  Can't go wrong here.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place takes all 5 stars for me.  Keep in mind, this is a cafe at an airport.  Their breakfast is good old fashion diner food, and they do it well.  However, what really makes this place for me is the service and view.  My family loves coming to watch the planes and eat a leisurely Sunday breakfast.  They are very kid friendly and my daughter always asks to go visit \"the nice ladies with food at the airport.\"  I will remain a frequent flier.  (I know, it was lame!)"}
{"text":"In a million years, I never would have stopped here on my own. A coffee shop in Chandler Municipal Airport? No way. But my dad is a private pilot and was visiting from San Jose. To appease him, I agreed to try it for breakfast, fully expecting to get a plate of grease. (He loves to east at McDonald's)  He said he goes to coffee shops at small airports all the time and he loves the food and opportunity to watch the planes takeoff/land.
 I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Except for the hash browns being a bit greasy, the eggs and bacon and toast were really good. The service was friendly and fast and the atmosphere was actually pretty fun. Cozy (crowded) but fun. They even have some great souvenirs you can buy. I am shocked to be saying this, but I will be back.  I am not a huge plane fan, but the food is worth returning for."}
{"text":"First of all, I can not believe this is the first time I've reviewed Hangar Cafe! I have been here more than a handful of times and literally enjoyed it so much. Everyone that comes into town - parents, friends, people I don't even know I recommend to come here. 

Drive up and step right onto the airport strip (safely away from the runway, don't worry.) The cafe is a small hometown feel with a casual setting. Tables have the hometown diner advertising on them and the theme, of course, is all airplane and airport themed. 

The menu is just one large page but full of flavor. There have been plenty of things to try here. My favorite is the Hangar burrito (the name isn't right, but it's close.) You have to try the cinnamon role, we almost always get it and it is delicious. 

Overall, definitely try this place out. It's a great place to take the family especially if you have kids there. As you walk in there is an airport hangar open, which you can walk into and see some airplanes up close and personal. Then enjoy a dining experience with airplanes taking off nearby."}
{"text":"Just moved to Chandler from NY last week.  A friend had told me this is one of the favorite breakfast spots, so I had to try it!  Everything was great!  The waitresses were very nice and helpful.  Food came out in reasonable time.  I tried the Chicken Fried Chicken (never had something like it before!).  Great portions for a great price.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Can't beat watching planes while enjoying breakfast.  Great local hangout."}
{"text":"This food here was good and it's in a neat location. The food came out fast & the customer service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very cool place for anyone of all ages! Airplanes all around. The restaurant is very busy but the service is fast, and the food is even better! My favorite breakfast meal is pancakes and they have some great, fluffy pancakes! Amy and Emily were phenomenal and attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here really wanting to love this place. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed!! The food was absolutely terrible!! We ordered 5 different meals and all of them were mediocre if not gross (especially the omelet)!! The service however was great! They were busy and we were well taken care of in a timely fashion. The planes there were so cool.  I have three sons under 8 and they all had a great time. We sat outside and they loved watching the planes take off as we ate breakfast. You also get the opportunity to walk around and check the parked planes out which my sons also loved. We may be back to check out the planes since we live down the street but we won't be staying to eat."}
{"text":"Wowzers.  This place is really good.  I had the Airport Burrito (you can see pics of this monster on this page if you look for it... its the one smothered in gravy)... it comes with hashbrowns inside of it, which I love, but something else I also love is when they are cooked perfectly.  And they were!  Just the right amount of crispiness, and oh so golden brown.  Holy mother, it was filling too!  I also had a cup of coffee, and in the 30 minutes I was there, I was asked if I needed more coffee at least 6 times.  I'm not joking about that.  I was also checked on a few other times, as in, \"do you need anything else?\".  

Excellent service, and good food!  The only thing I took a star off for was that it was LOUD in the restaurant.  I suppose it doesn't help that I came in at 8 o'clock on a Saturday (??? Being from Portland, OR, I was SHOCKED at how many people were awake and having breakfast here... and nobody was wearing sunglasses!).  I would definitely go back another time if I knew when it was not so busy, but hey, that's what keeps restaurants open, right?"}
{"text":"I've been here many times since my original review and they are consistent!

I met my wife here for lunch on a Monday and it felt like a secret little rendevous!

Meeting at a hidden diner tucked away into a little regional airport, crossing the tarmac to get to the restaurant, watching folks hop in to their little planes and taxi away..."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated with a friendly staff right away. We ordered and the food didn't take too long. I had the chorizo burrito, but I felt like the chorizo was too fine, so it didn't hold its shape well and fell apart easily; it was also a little too greasy and was missing the spice. The waffles on the other hand was great - my husband devoured it. The service after we sat down was a little slow. We only had our drinks filled once, we just needed one more refill. We sat there twiddling our thumbs afterwards because we didn't know how to pay or what to do, a server saw us sitting there waiting, but didn't do anything. No one was dropping off a check, so we just walked up to pay."}
{"text":"My family loves Hangar Cafe. I went for the first time on Saturday and it was delicious! We went for breakfast and I had the biscuits and gravy. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"It had been a number of years since I'd been to a little airport restaurant.  It took us a few minutes to figure out how to enter.  I won't ruin the fun for you.

We enjoyed our breakfast.  Service was good.  Only complaint is that their coffee mugs are small."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great prices and fun to watch the planes take off and come in."}
{"text":"Cool location being on the hangar. Very relaxed environment. Portions of food are ok, but appropriately priced. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because they could step up the food another notch to make this place an attraction.  For example, I wanted corned beef & hash, but they don't make their own from scratch - they use the stuff out of a can. If they would elevate their ingredients and cook more from scratch it would certainly improve the menu options."}
{"text":"i have been searching for over a year now (moving from northern CA) for somewhere that serves this kind of food for this price.  AZ in full to the rim with crap places and places that are good but charge an arm and your mothers leg for anything.  not the hangar.  the hangar puts a reuben in your face without raping your wallet.  i have not been so happy to eat in so long, i almost wept.  it is my new and ONLY go to place for breakfast and lunch.  see you there.
***my first meal rundown***
reuben with fries, and an iced tea.
reuben was amazing.  the bread was toasted perfectly, the meat was tender and perfect, the sauerkraut wasnt overwhelming.  my mouth is watering at the memory as i write this.
the fries COULD have been a little more done, but they were still good, and not one survived my attack.
if i had to not like anything, i didnt particularly care for the iced tea.  it was a little on the \"was there tea in this water?\" side, but still refreshing."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today. Bacon and over easy eggs were excellent.  Hubby loved his omelet and son loved the pancackes. We got there at 8:00 and got right in, but it did get busy after that. Very neat watching all the airplanes. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes on a Friday then watched a couple walk in and sign in and be seated at a table meant for us immediately. Atmosphere is chaotic and hurried, which led to the severs overlooking us. We left without eating after 40 minutes with clothes smelling like greasy, burned food"}
{"text":"So good!! Came here as a recommendation from a friend. Child friendly. It was worth the wait. Every single staff was so nice and patient even though it was super busy and packed. Food is big portion and really good. The view is awesome too the airplanes is right outside the window. We will come here again and next time were are definitely trying their dessert/pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is OK to hanger out and check view the aircraft parked in front and those flying over head .  However I was not impressed with their burger, much toooo greasy and I never did get the wait staff to bring mustard and mayo.  Hopefully their other dishes are better.  Not my first choice to take out of towners to."}
{"text":"I'm a guy.  I like watching planes.  I like watching old WWI style biplanes.  I like watching attractive women get in and out of old WWI style biplanes.  And I like doing all of the above while having breakfast.

Sometimes, while sitting outside, you get to overhear compelling conversations.  \"You know its hard buying underwear for you.  You have your father's irregular crotch.\"

My previous supervisor took me here one day for breakfast.  After a quick glance at the menu, I ordered an egg breakfast for under $4.  What a deal!

Turns out, it was basically an egg mcmuffin.  So much for the deal, but you cant beat the ambiance.

I took my wife here a few weeks ago, and she loved it.  One of my favorite places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Place is just fantastic, the food is amazing the portions are big, service and staff are amazing.   A true must try little hidden place if you have not been there.  Will return for sure!!"}
{"text":"1st Time here, glad we stopped by... Lunch isnt quite the essence of this place, more for Breakfast, and will try that soon... But.. We did eat Lunch, near end of shift / 1:00-1:30 ish.. Last customers to leave... and the staff were awesome and cheerful, and not like, damn we want to close up, hurry please.. totally opposite.. 

Wife tried the Gyro, and I had a burger, mushroom n green chili..
Lunch isnt the focus for this place, but I will go here way before Dennys or anything.. Now breakfst will be another story,, and may affect my ratings.. 

Lunch food Rating is a 3, Staff Hospitality and the location in the actual small airport gets this place a 4. Will do Bfast Early am, and sit on the patio, if available,, We'll see... 

Coming back SOON"}
{"text":"Very cute place to come and have breakfast.  You are right by the runway and you can watch the planes take off.  I had a bagel and a scrambled egg.  My husband had pancakes, eggs and sausage. He liked his a lot. Mine was also very good. Good customer service! A cute place to go and have breakfast."}
{"text":"We were in town for a graduation and were looking for a place to eat breakfast. I looked on YELP and found the Hanger Cafe, so let our party know we would meet there for breakfast on Sunday morning about 10am. I figured it would be slow since it is out of the way and it is after the normal breakfast rush, but I was wrong. Our party of 12 had to wait about 35 minutes, which really is it that long for that size of a group. It was well worth the wait! The food was amazing. Everyone's order was exactly correct, the chicken fried steak was very good and I could cut it with a fork. The milk gravy was awesome, almost as good as mine. LOL. The green Chile was good, and that is coming from someone that is from the green Chile capital of the world, New Mexico. Thou it could have been hotter, it had a good flavor. I definitely recommend making this a must stop place on your next visit to Phoenix, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My son took me to the Hangar Caf√© yesterday for lunch.  What a hoot!  This place is so full of character that it could easily be used as a movie set for a 1950s Caf√©.  And I mean that in a good way.  The place has a great vibe.

And the food's not so bad, either.  I had the gyro platter with a Greek salad, and it was excellent.  My son had the club sandwich and it was so big even he couldn't eat it all.

The service was prompt and friendly.  We had a good time and a good meal.  You should try it, too."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I guess I will start with the only positive aspect of the visit, and that was our waitress who was attentive and pleasant. 

With that out of the way, we came in for breakfast, but it appears we came in for the 2 hours they serve lunch. I mean, it's the weekend and switching over to lunch only for 2 hours? OK, not the biggest gripe, but it set us up for a disastrous lunch. 

Let me preface by saying that even if their breakfast is good, that I will never be back to try it because of how lackluster the lunch was. 

I am not a \"foodie snob\", I can respect an average meal still. The packaged hummus from Costco/Sams was better tasting than this - let alone from a respectable Mediterranean place.  The ground beef they laid over the top was tasteless and their was mysterious burnt pieces with the meat (maybe square pieces of onion?). It really seemed like it was left over ground beef crumbles from the frozen burger patties. They gave you maybe 1 pita shell sliced into triangular \"chips\". 

The fried mac n cheese was essentially Kraft Mac n cheese formed into a triangle with the batter. The marinara sauce was literally chef boyardee with canned tomato chunks added. So yes Kraft Mac n cheese + chefboyardee are tolerable food sources when necessity calls for it, but for $10?

Again... Most reviews were based off breakfast and this review purely reflects off our lunch experience- and it was bad enough for us to say... Never again."}
{"text":"This is located inside the chandler municipal airport. I found out they only serve breakfast from open to noon even though they close at 2pm (like a breakfast place would normally). We went around 12 and the place was packed, but we were able to be seated as we walked through the door. Anyway, I ordered the chicken club which is chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato on a croissant with a side of fries and coffee. First of all, the coffee was bitter and tasted a bit off. The sandwich and fries were just okay, but a bit underwhelming but we ended up paying $30. The fries were a bit chewy and on the cold side. Like others stated, this is a 3.5/5 star place and your average caf√© with attentive waitresses. It does have some cool decor around the restaurant and you have views of airplanes.

Pro: great customer service and the location. 
Cons: average food and higher dollar amount for what they serve."}
{"text":"Fantastic diner. Great location surrounded by planes at Chandler airport, great food, service and prices."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is pretty good, atmosphere is great and service is 2nd to none.  A real locals place."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with this place. The Cessna props in the background. Walking past a flight line of small prop aircraft just to get inside. The fact that it's a real diner, not a hipster place trying to be a diner. 

The food was absolutely delicious. 

I want to come back to this every morning.
I want to move close by for this place. 

Eat here"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local breakfast joints. Gets crazy-crowded on weekends, so it's usually a weekday-only stop for me. Killer omelets and outstanding fluffy, never greasy, hash browns.  Fast, friendly service. I've been to many similar little cafes in local airports, and it seems they're always good. Hangar Cafe is no exception, give it a shot - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Can't believe it has taken me so long to try this place out -- so glad I did!
Old school vibe for sure, but the place is clean and well maintained.  Of course the airport setting is neat, w/ small aircraft taxiing within yards of the cafe.  Lastly, service is very friendly and efficient. 

The chow? Tasty!  I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and chicken fried steak. Hash browns a perfect crispy outside, soft on the inside. Chicken fried steak tender and perfectly fried. So tasty!!  The Belgian Waffle had a blueberry or strawberry option for an additional $1.25, and they add the fruit to the batter, not as a side-dollop on top.  Bursting w/ the berries, and cooked golden brown, the waffle is damn good!

I've found my GO TO BFast stop in Chandler!

Cheers!

{"text":"Very cool, unique place to visit. Our kiddos loved watching the planes come in and take off while we waited for our table. We went on Father's Day, and the wait was only about 20 minutes. They definitely turn tables quickly. Food was good, nothing absolutely amazing but good nonetheless. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fun to watch the planes come and go but not used to spending almost $90. For breakfast for 2 adults and 3 kids especially since the food was just not great chorizo burrito was so greasy I couldn't eat it none of the items were great we did have a nice server but we will not be back"}
{"text":"My father in law is coming to town this fall and is ga-ga for aviation so when I heard about this joint, I had to give it a test run.  I went in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon and there were just a few open parking spaces.  I am not one to think of a place as being worthy just because of it's traffic.  (Think Olive Garden).  

I was seated at a table between a group of flight wives and a group of hard working men in cowboy hats, quite a diverse set of guests, I think.  My waitress promptly brought my menu and returned just as fast with my water.  

I poured over the menu trying to decide...I'm horrible at restaurants and I didn't have my husband beside me to hurry me along.  I decided that the true way to judge a restaurant like this one was to order a burger.  I ordered Rick's special with fries. 

My meal was served quickly and as soon as it was ready.  No heat lamps here!  My fries were good, not great because I like mine more on the crispy brown side than the pale tan side but they can't read my mind.  The burger!!! Wow!  It came on a fresh, soft french roll with two patties (I didn't notice that in the description otherwise guilt wouldn't have let me order it!)  The patties had white and yellow American cheese on it, lettuce, tomato, sweet onion, and a special sauce similar to McD's.  I normally would have given 1/2 of my burger to my hubby, but alas, I had no one to share it with and so I just HAD to finish it.  :)

My bill was $7 and change plus tip for this glorious find.  I can't wait to bring my friends and family here when it is cooler so that we can sit outside and watch the planes take off and land...that is if I can take my eyes off my meal!

(I didn't notice that high chairs were available...if you need one, I'd call to check)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I am disappointed that I waited so long. The food was good, nothing fancy but good. Our waitress was very friendly and the atmosphere of eating at an airport and watching airplanes leave and land is awesome! I don't know who enjoyed it more, my spouse and I or our kids!"}
{"text":"Great local place. Dutch fry and hash burrito are great. Fun for kids and adults alike,  as you can watch the planes take off while dining."}
{"text":"Great way to start your day in Chandler, AZ! The beautiful sunrise over San Tan Mountain awakens your vision to cessna-style airplane activity of the lively Chandler Municiple Airport. Right next to the welcoming cafe entrance is a hangar showcasing beautiful airplanes to experience up-close. As you step inside the Hangar Cafe, you are greeted with bright faces of the friendly staff and captivating airplane-themed decor. As your eyes grow wide from the invigorating menu and the aroma of fresh breakfasts fill the air, you will realize what a great decision you made to get your first meal of the day at Hangar Cafe. I went with their delicious Denver omlette which made my tastebuds tingle to the very last bite. Dining at the Hangar Cafe is more than a meal, it's a day brightening experience!"}
{"text":"If you ever flew a small plane or flew with someone, you are gonna love this place.  Loys of good food.  Go!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back here in a very long time. We were not disappointed. As soon as you walk in you're greeted by a friendly voice and face who seats you at a table. There is an extensive menu for adults and a minimal menu for kids. The food is freshly made and delicious. The kids loved their pancakes and I had the corn beef and hash. Very good next time I'll have to try one of their breakfast burritos. If your kids don't like Pulp in their orange juice, I would suggest the apple juice or milk instead."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat outside with the kids. It's normal, good breakfast food at a reasonable price with planes around you. If that appeals to you then check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday just before noon, only to be informed that we had missed brunch (after being forced to wait for a table), and there was no compromise. Funny, I thought brunch was the marriage of breakfast and lunch not only in menu choices, but also in timing...or is that just me?

Nonetheless, lunch might have been okay, except the choices were uninspired and poorly presented. I had chili (canned Hormel), and a chicken Philly (desert dry). My husband opted for a chicken club, which was served on a croissant, but the bottom half of the bread was missing - what a mess! And my son, who usually has a very healthy appetite, left 2/3 of his steak Philly uneaten. He said it was \"just okay\". This was all in stark contrast to our first experience here during which the food and the service were \"top flight\".

Because of that good first impression, we'll definitely try the Hangar Cafe again, and the next time we'll be sure to get there earlier."}
{"text":"Good not great.

Ordered chicken salad sandwich.  The chicken kind of had the texture of tuna fish.  Good news it didn't taste that way but I did find the texture odd.  Also could have sworn the menu said it had walnuts.  I didn't see any walnuts.

Also ordered a patty melt.  It was good, but again the texture of the meat kind of reminded me of meat loaf (like there was some type of filler added to the meat).

Fries were average.

Overall...average."}
{"text":"Really nice place to grab a breakfast or lunch.  We got there right at change-over from the breakfast menu to lunch (~noon), and we went with lunch.  I had the philly and my son had the burger.  Both were good.  The fries were awesome, my favorite kind.  It's set right in the airport, which is cool.  The staff is awesome, really friendly and fast.  I recommend this place and will return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"If you are interested in sipping mediocre coffee while watching small planes take off then I get it.  I can absolutely see the appeal, on occasion.  What I don't get are the high praise and reviews for the food.  It's not good, it just isn't.  At best I'd call it average.  First of all, they lack selection.  No turkey bacon or turkey sausage, and a very limited menu for people who don't eat pork.  There's like... a bunch of us, you know?  Then the eggs aren't well prepared, veggies don't snap in the omelette and aren't fresh, and the pancakes are rubbery.  I've been here 3 times, I'm that sure it isn't nearly as good as people's nostalgia is telling them.  It's just the planes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great staff, food and drinks in a great location. The severs are friendly. The simple yet delicious food comes out fast. Bonus they have the cleanest restroom, I have ever seen, in a small diner atmosphere."}
