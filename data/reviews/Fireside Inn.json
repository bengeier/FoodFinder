{"text":"Had. A. Great  fish sandwich.   Really good. Nice atomshere.   But  was  early afternoon. Bartender  friendly.  For  first  time  in there.     Guessing  I be back  for the  wings  next  time. :))"}
{"text":"I have been to the Fireside a few times because they do have okay food, but my past several experiences have gone from bad to worse. First, I ordered wings and an appetizer from there for pickup. We were told 30 minutes, and my boyfriend headed over in 30 minutes only to get there and wait an additional 30 minutes. Obviously they never put the order in, but of course not only did they not admit that, but they also never apologized or offered any extras for our inconvenience of waiting twice what they promised.   So still, we decided to give them another chance. Their wing nights are Tuesdays and Wednesdays offering $.30 wings. We double checked the website for the special to  make sure we had the right day and price before we left the house. As we arrive and sit down there is a piece of paper at the end of our table stating Wednesday wings are $.50 (Almost double what they used to be).  When the waitress finally comes over I ask and SHOW HER that the website says wings are $.30 today. She says, \"Oh that needs changed. They're not. They're $.50\".  No, \"I'm sorry\" because that's their motto, and no offering to honor the special stated on the website since that's what drew us in to begin with. We immediately got up in left.   My recommendation is to drive the extra 1/8 mile down the road to MUGSHOTS in the shopping center. Better environment, good food, BETTER PRICES by a mile, and better service. You walk into the Fireside and everyone just stares at you like you don't belong because you aren't in there 6 days a week, and the staff is completely miserable"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a beer and appetizer.  This looks like a good local watering hole with a nice big square bar on one side of the building with seats on three sides. There are plenty of bar stools and some screens around the bar playing sports. On the other side of the building there are tables for patrons who want to dine at a tables. There were also some screens at that side.   Beer selections from the tap looked like they were limited to three options, including Yuengling, which I ordered a pint of. The price was really good, I think $2.25 or $2.50.   I got a pierogie appetizer, which was ok. The menu looked like a lot of typical bar grub.   This isn't the type of place I would drive out of the way for, but if you're in the area and want a good spot to drink and watch games this is good for you to try."}
{"text":"Old school bar. Smoker friendly. Classic bar food...chicken fingers, sandwiches, and very good wings. Daily specials for food & booze. Pool tables & darts too. Danny the bartender will make you feel like you've been a regular for years even on your first visit. And they even have the 50 yard line from Three Rivers Stadium Turf on the wall as you walk in. Classic Pittsburgh bar thru & thru."}
{"text":"Great specials and great service! A great spot to watch the game. It's $1 to play pool & they have various games there as well. The food isn't bad at all& the location is perfect."}
{"text":"It's never super busy there, so crowds aren't an issue. It's a nice place to kick back, have a few beers, and shoot some pool."}
{"text":"Its our place for Wednesday wing nite there only 45cent. I don't drink but Lisa does and she said the beers cheap and always cold. Food is ok being a wing aficionado I rate there Garlic parmesan my top pick lisa likes the sweet chill. But you can smoke here makes you feel like good parts of America still out there with out obama ruining things"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with his cousins from out of town last night, and it was great! We had the wing special, and they were amazing! Very friendly staff, and its awesome that you can still smoke in here! We will be back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Sports Bar, Restaurant, Pool, Golden Tee, 5+ Large Flat Screen TV's, and we haven't even gotten to the Menu yet.   Wings are Highly Recommended. They have a unique sauce called \"Rodeo\" it is \"BBQ Sauce with Horseradish\"  It's really good.   We were patronizing this establishment to view the Penguins Game and eat some foods on a Thursday Evening. The daily special was Beef Tacos $1.25 each & choice of Hard Shell, Soft Shell, or Grilled Soft Shell. We all tried the Grilled Soft Shell, and we were all extremely delighted.   PROS: 7 Days a Week the Daily Specials are AWESOME!  Easy Parking   CONS: Limited amount of Draught / Tap Beers. (3, I think) and inside Smoking.   Bartender was very friendly. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined in the restaurant once, been to a party in the back once, and ordered takeout a couple times. Great local option -even better now that it's nonsmoking. I called kind of late for takeout one night not knowing the kitchen was like closing that moment and the bartender assured me it was totally fine and they'd make whatever we wanted. I was impressed. The nightly specials are good (esp taco night!!) and the prices are pretty cheap. Kudos to whoever is responsible for the robot woman rotating the sign out front. I drive past often and still do a double take!!"}
