{"text":"Wow!   Luckily, I found myself in Cleveland visiting family.  Luckily, I checked Yelp for a place to eat.    Heart 'n Soul ranks as one of the best meals of my life.  I am a hard-core New York/Los Angeles foodie.  I am talking Eric Ripert, Michael Voltaggio, Charlie Palmer, Paul Prudhomme, David Bouley, Mario Batali-foodie.  Best ribs ever.  Best Mac 'n Cheese ever.  I only regret that I had to pass on the peach cobbler since we were having a celebration cake at the in-laws later.  Clevelanders - I've been to Lola and loved it but, I am telling you, Michael Symon will want to come here on his day off!  Lovely service too.  Those ribs..."}
{"text":"I'm rarely impressed by a restaurant - particularly when there is rather sporadic (and sometimes mediocre) table service.  With that out of the way - this place is amazing.  A longtime visitor of the south, I love soul food and get really irritated when people claim something is southern just because they deep fried it.  This is my fifth time here and every experience has involved wonderful food. Today we had a group of 6 people and our meals ranged from the Alabama Slammer (a hot dog with pulled pork and slaw), chicken and waffles, fried chicken meal, pulled pork sandwich, and huge wings.   Everyone enjoyed their meals and several people ordered a takeout meal for later in the day.  We enjoyed fried green tomatoes for an appetizer - the serving was large for the nominal price (somewhere under $3 for 5-7 slices) and they were freshly breaded and fried today - I actually saw them cutting the tomatoes and breading them. The breading wasn't too heavy (a common mistake) and the spices were just right.  The sauce served with it had a definite spicy kick but the owner warned us that she had a heavy hand with the spices when she was making it this morning.  I had chicken and waffles and the owner (who has come out every time I have been there to chat) noticed I wasn't eating the waffles and chicken together - she provided a recommendation of waffles with butter, hot sauce, and maple syrup.  I thought it was great before - after her recommendation it became phenomenal.  The only caveat:  the service can be slow, which I think comes from a combination of their staff (many of whom are family members), but also because they make so many things by hand when they are ordered.  They had a quick turnaround on the fried green tomatoes but things that required more cooking (like the chicken) took longer, which is to be expected.  If you are willing to commit to a longer meal time and you like soul food, this is hands down the best place I've found in the Ohio area (and better than most places I've tried in the south).  As a life-long skeptic of most things, it's rare I recommend a place to someone but I think I and all the dining companions I've brought here, have really enjoyed the food and the experience."}
{"text":"Little divey place on Euclid in Wickliffe, but boy can their food amaze.  We ordered the ribs with the sweet sauce - but what was exceptional were the sides.  I had collard greens - and I hate collard greens, and loved - no worshipped these.  The greens and the mac and cheese - which was perfect - so obviously homemade and wonderful - just the right amount of clumpiness and cheesy goodness.  My son had the fried green tomatoes (which he pronounced as being as good as any he had in South Carolina) and the cheesy grits.  Needless to say - we will go back.  I regret not ordering dessert, because they looked wonderful - even fabulous in their authenticity and reading reviews below I am tempted to hop in the car right now and get some!  I was not too impressed with the ribs, but the sweet sauce was fabulous.  Next time, I think I will go for chicken or pulled pork.  Reasonable prices, good cornbread, great desserts and a list of sides to die for - what more could you want?"}
{"text":"I never feel inspired to write a Yelp review after a meal but this place earned it. I lived in North Carolina for 5 years and am in no way a Soul Food expert but this is exactly what I was hoping to find in Ohio.   My girlfriend and I were a little worried when we walked in at 12:30 and didn't see anyone else in the dining room but that quickly changed when we were greeted by the extremely knowledgeable son of the owner. He gave some great recommendations and was prompt with everything.   I had the 4 piece Chicken and Waffles and a side of Mac and Cheese. The chicken was perfectly cooked. 4 completely de-boned breasts with the chicken skin still on and then fried! The waffles were light and fluffy with a hint of cinnamon. A perfect combination. The mac and cheese was great, not overly cheesy and piping hot.   My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp and Grits at the recommendation of the waiter (\"best thing on the menu\") and she was amazed. She said it belonged on the menus of any of the $20/plate restaurants we've been to in North Carolina and New Orleans, and all for $8.99. It was a huge portion too, not overly cheesed and did not turn into a congealed mess at the end like shrimp and grits can.   We ended the meal by ordering two slices of sweet potato pie to go and the owner hand-delivered it to make sure we tried a bite before leaving. It was truly delicious.   We'll definitely be going back to try the pulled pork, ribs, fried green tomatoes, and a hot dog. Oh, and the carrot cake that the owner said is her best-seller.   Where was everyone?! Try this place now!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food.  We had the veggie omelette (onions, tomatoes, onions, peppers, potatoes, broccoli and cheese) with home fries and toast and chicken with waffles. Homemade and delicious- $7 each. Agree with the other previous reviewer's comments. Wanted to try one of the dozen or more sides or something from the bakery but we were stuffed from the large servings.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since. The the level of customers is about the same or less. This time I tried the hamburger and was very dissapointed. The meat is very dense and not very flavorful. The Iced Tea was from the bottom of the pot and tasted very tanin.   I went back to visit after the Sun Messenger's restaurant review. I was hoping the restaurant going to be more prosper than ever. Maybe we went at the wrong time and we were the only one of two tables for the night.   The owner can really put out some great food especially the chicken and waffles. For me, I am a died heart Southern Fried Chicken fan.  Good luck!"}
