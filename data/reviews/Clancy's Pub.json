{"text":"Wendy is the absolute best!!!  Please visit on Saturday through Monday. She's friendly, fast, and keeps it all under control. Easily the best local bar in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The worst customer service!!!!! Very rude!!!! This establishment can not affird to be rude.... Management  & bartenders......."}
{"text":"It is a midwest neighborhood bar.  And kind of like my second home."}
{"text":"0 stars. Went here for the second time in a week last night. Slowest service I have ever experienced. Great happy hour specials however you better order all of your drinks for the night at once or else you will be stuck waiting 45 minutes till you get to order again. In the end I waited 20 minutes for my check and finally just went to the bartender, gave him money and pointed out my waitress because she didn't seem to concerned with helping."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place, food is a bit slow to get out of the kitchen but it is good bar food. Burgers are good, my rubin was tasty and over all nice spot for lunch. If they could speed up the service I'd rate them higher."}
{"text":"when i first saw that a 'pizza and grill' was on its way i was very interested as ive never bothered with the prior establishments there.

my buddy and i went there rather quickly during opening week only to find out they did not have any pizza yet....

after a couple weeks we decided to try again and see what could become of this place. 

happy hour is unimpressive with drink specials. $2 domestic bottles is an okay deal, but $13 for a shallow premium pitcher seemed excessive. but they do have a couple good quality brews.

a rather small, quiet place with a patio and 5 flatscreens. it could be a nice place to catch a Cards or Dbacks game, that is if they maybe put the sound on.

but it really came down to the pizza. getting a 12\" with pepperoni was an ideal test. turns out it was decent. toppings seemed generous, but the crust seemed a bit generic. maybe their specialty pizzas are the key(?). pizza-wise they are a slight upgrade on Zipps (next door), but thats not really saying much cause im not a fan of zipps pizza.

i was expecting much more considering the word 'pizza' is right in the pub's title. really not a good enough reason to go back as Zipps is right next door with better drink deals and atmosphere.

i wish them luck."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had a few too many and ordered the chicken fingers and tater tots.  I warned her not to.  However, after enough tequila to make a burro's knees buckle, the chicken fingers and tater tots didn't agree with her.  I'm not sure if it was the food or too much to drink in general, that's why I'm giving it a 3-star rating.  Based on everybody else's - I think I'm about spot on."}
{"text":"I want to just say that I'm not one to just complain.  I really like Zipps next door to this place.  If you have the option and it's not too busy my suggestion would be to visit Zipps instead.  The beer is over priced, it has an odor that is very unpleasant, and the staff not only get drunk while there working but act as drunks as well.  So God knows if you could trust your credit card with them.  By all means if you want to drink in an unsafe atmosphere where there is most certainly an argument/fight every night, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid! Do not waste your time and money. Last night I went to get all you can eat fish and chips. I came in, sat at the table and waited.. waited and waited. The server wouldn't have stopped at all, but I finally asked for help. I got the menu and few secs later she came back to ask me if I was ready. I ordered the hummus appetizer and fish and chips. I didn't get my food for about 30 min, and when it was delivered, the food was cold as ice. I asked for another plate and it didn't arrive for another 15 min... HORRIBLE and very INCOMPETENT crew. Completely disorganized and not careless. I would honestly think twice before going there. Thanks,
KK"}

{"text":"If you're looking for a great neighborhood bar, this is your place. The service is friendly, the food is better than most \"bar food\" and the crowd seems happy to be there. Football season is big here. They even give away jerseys on Monday nights! It might be the only place in the Valley where you can see Packers and Bears fans at the same table sharing a 10$ bucket of beers and some PB&J Chicken wings (that's right, Peanut Butter and Jelly Chicken Wings....Spectacular)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever posted on yelp but I just couldn't let this place get away with calling themselves a Pub.

Like most it would seem we went in solely because Zipps was overly packed due to the ASU/Oregon game. My buddy warned me about the place but we were hungry so I told him to give it a 2nd chance as I had not been there before. I wish I could still say that.

To start we sat at the bar where we waited a few minutes to be greeted. Both just ordered beers. After asking for menu we noticed there was no real food theme here so I went for the pizza and my buddy the burger. As I asked the bartender if I could have regular bacon over Canadian she looked at me straight faced as if she was offended and said \" all bacon is Canadian\" I let that go but shouldn't have.

Almost one hour later still no food. I again made the mistake of talking to this girl, as I asked where the food was she rolled her eyes and said \"we have a small kitchen\". I expressed that I wasn't satisfied with our service and would just like to cancel our order. This is the best yet as she spoke across the bar to me \"we'll it's almost ready so we have problem\". At that point I was pissed so I expressed the problem wasn't mine and we were leaving, was still charged for the 1 beer I drank.

Definitely will not be back, if Zipps is too busy we will walk deep into old town before ever walking in here again. HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come in a few times a week and Serenity and Wendy always make me feel welcome! Everyone else is great too, but these two lady's take the cake! I recommend people try this place! The food is great, service is great, and the drinks are reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"We reviewed Clancy's on Yelp.  Studied the menu and liked what we saw, so we went there tonight.  Disappointed!!!  If an establishment is going to have a web site with menu, Keep it up to date.  I specifically went there to have a pork tenderloin sandwich.  It is no longer on the menu and the waitress said it hadn't been on the menu for quite awhile.  In addition, prices had jumped up to 20%.  Some of the sides that had been choices included now had extra charges.  
I feel were lured there under false pretenses.  The food we had was okay, but not worth the current prices.  
I will be watching the web site to see how long it takes to get updated.  Anything more than a few days is too much.  Unless things change, we probably won't be back.  
We eat out  4 plus times a week.  Not a customer that should get disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, decently priced food, good music and tigers games make this a must visit. Next door to Zipps so mostly overlooked which is a real shame. Top 5 bars I've visited in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood bar. Good place to kick it with the wife after a long day and not looking for something too fancy. Trivia on Wednesday's, good burgers, and love their Irish nachos."}
{"text":"Came in here on a random Tuesday night, which is apparently \"Southwestern night\". Deals on tacos, taco salad, and margaritas. Margaritas are definitely nothing to write home about. and the service was ok. 
Total for four people was $41, which included a margarita and a beer. 
Randomly, a side of mayo is a quarter and a side of guacamole is a dollar...but they're the same size.
Guess they have a $4.99 steak deal on Wednesdays, which also requires a $2 drink purchase. 
Wide variety of people in the bar. Definitely a place for locals and  regulars. Dart board, TVs, and looks like some Nebraska fans.
Will we go back? Meh..."}
{"text":"This is a chill place off the beaten path in Old Town, mostly regulars come here and  you can walk over to Zipps next door."}
{"text":"I'm torn on leaving 3 or 4 stars. I really like this place and they are a Husker bar which is awesome being from Nebraska.  Their wings and great and usually have awesome specials.  My only complaint is that it seems like they are under staffed at the worst times. Whenever I have been here for large sporting events, they don't have enough bar tenders or servers. It can become very difficult to get a drink at times.  Other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Not bad at all, actually.  A nice alternative when their neighbor, Zipps, is jammed - or when you want a lower-key outing.  Somewhat of a hole-in-the-wall, but my wife and I were impressed with the food (considering it was a bar).  Drink selection isn't bad, and their service was friendly and prompt.  We'll be back in."}
{"text":"A large group of us came for St. Patrick's Day.  It was only a $5 cover, and there was amazing service, awesome live music, and great drinks.  Not sure I'll return on an ordinary night out, but this was a very fun time."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Neighborhood bar. A-Ok, but not great. 

I stumbled in here last night in search of food with my friends. We went over to Zipps, sat down, and then discovered that their kitchen closes at Midnight, and Clancy's was our next best bet.

The drinks are pretty standard. Typical beer selection, and nothing too notable other than an average liquor selection. 

They do have food until closing time, which is a plus. You can get reubens, quesadillas, and most importantly, tots. Yeah. Tots. Hell yeah. 

I don't understand how an Irish themed place can have all this kind of stuff on the menu, but who cares. You come here to drink, and then eat because you have to. 

I'd come here again if I was in a pinch, but its certainly not a destination point."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you're looking for fine dining- this isn't the spot. It's such a classic local watering hole. Great food by all means, but it is very casual."}
{"text":"Clancy's is better than Zipps.  Better specials, nicer staff, nicer clientele than your typical Scottsdale douchebag hangout.  It's where the nice locals go.  I just wish they'd get a better beer selection."}
{"text":"I have a special place for Clancy's in my heart because I am from NE and have been to the Clancy's in Omaha many times and I'm a huge Husker fan.  So ya, my review is a little biased.  I go to Clancy's pretty often during football season and its always packed.  Its a small bar/restaurant but the drinks are cheap and the food is good.  I've said it before, any place with tots is a friend of mine.  I've gotten burgers, wings, pizza, etc from there.  It has all been good, not amazing but good.  I'll continue to go there for the Husker season!"}
{"text":"Needed a place with no wait for a quick breakfast and tried out Clancy's, but it did not work out well. The place was almost empty at about 9am on the weekend in terms of people eating, There was an old guy having a beer, an older woman having a double and three older guys about to order drinks. They had the right idea. 
     Breakfast Burrito - Price was good at 5 bucks, but a good number of the potatoes were not cooked all the way and that pretty much destroys the burrito, which had potential by using green chiles.
   Pancakes - tried a short stack for $3.19, but you had to kind of tug and pull to cut these large cakes. Fluffy they were not and giving us some real butter seems more reasonable than having to use all of those tiny country crock packets. Either way, not impressive and will stick to the lunch/dinner selections in future visits."}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place bc they are locals and come here often, everyone knows everyone. The food is good and the servers/ bartenders were nice and treated us well, especially bc we went there with our friends who are regulars. It is fun to drink there on a fri. Or sat. Night. Clean bar. Good food. And really close within walking distance to other places. Recommend.;)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, i would. I'd love to give it two, but only if by giving it a two, I could use both of my middle fingers.
Rude staff. Rude, nasty clientele. 
Walked in with a party of 7, including some kids, because Zipps a few doors down was on a wait. We wanted to drink some  beers, eat some food, and watch the game. Our party was not even greeted by a staff member. It was around 6:30.
There was an older couple sitting by the door, as well as some drunks outside on the patio, who also made us feel most unwelcime, saying, \"thank God \" when we walked out after waiting around 10 minutes to be acknowledged. These are older, well behaved kids who were looking forward to pizza and football.
Bottom line: Go to Zipps. Unless you're an old, crusty alcoholic with a shitty attitude. Then, go to Clancy's."}
{"text":"One of the biggest lessons I learned living in Nebraska was you do as you say. You follow thru on all your promises. While Clancy's totes itself as a midwestern spirit pub in AZ, they have missed an important midwestern value. While I can appreciate that there are many NE fans in AZ, that shouldn't mean service should completely lack. This \"pub\" cannot complete proper bar service. At one point, it took us 45 minutes to get a single drink. Amaretto and coke. Nothing too complex. The server even at one point mentioned she forgot the drink. After a 45 minute wait period, we finally were able to flag down someone else. This person promised drinks right away and we were able to get an amaretto/coke and we also ordered a vodka/Red Bull because 45 minutes had gone by. We were brought two of each drink. This man promised that he would comp those drinks without us even mentioning or asking. The couple next to us asked if orders had To be placed inside because no one took their drink order for over 30 minutes. We were able to place an order for food. Nachos and wings. After an hour, we finally got our food. One thing I'm certain of, nachos don't take long to cook but the cheese on my nachos was so hard and cooled off, it was basically inedible. We were able to flag down our server to request our check because we knew the service wouldn't be getting any better. To our surprise, we were billed for everything. Every. Single. Drink. Why promise to comp drinks and take care of us if you can't follow thru? If I could give 0 stars, I would. If I could even find someone to complain to in that \"pub\", I would have. But you can't even order drinks without it taking 45 minutes. I would say it was the worst customer service but there was none."}
{"text":"Great local bar in Scottsdale which is mostly locals other than during the Nebraska Husker games. Funny that we are not true Nebraska fans but by default since we have friends who are Big Red fans so we patron during the games. They have Great chicken wings and decent bar food but no gluten free beer option so I only give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, service and prices.  Only real neighborhood pub feeling around.  Go Big Red."}
{"text":"5 stars for casual and unpretentious........If  your like for a great neighborhood bar, that treats local good bar food and a few one of original ideas....come on in and meet some of the colorful local or the sweet hot sexy bartender seems More like the managing interest and her lovely charmingly animated girlfriend.  HELL JUST COME HAVE A COLD ONE ENJOY THE PATIO, AND SPORTS ON MULTIPLE SCREENS.  Everyone is warm, friendly and it is one of the only no pretentious drinking spots in Scottsdale that isn't a dive.   Have fun!!!! Shoot Some golden Tee and unwind for happy hour...you'll grow to love it too!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the food which is above average when it comes to bar food.  If your tired of the old town club scene and looking for a relaxing place to wet your whistle this is a great place.  You will not find a bunch of 20 something's dancing on tables here.  

Had the chicken wrap with side salad which was great and the price was even better at $9.29.  The drink prices are also way below average for the location. 

All in all a good place to come and have a drink or 2 and skip the crowds and over pricing of old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked into this pub after Zips was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  We were starving and didn't want to drive anywhere else so we figured we'd try Clancy's.  This was our first mistake.  Strip mall bar is complement for this dump.  The projector TV on the wall was faded, barely visible, and of course the one TV with the Cardinals game on was back under it's dingy bar so it was barely visible.  

Food:  We ordered the Hot Wings, Pepper Jack Burger, and for an appetizer Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole.  All of these bar munchies are basically impossible to screw up by anyone not drooling on themselves or riding a short bus yet this place managed to ruin all three.  The wings seemed like they were microwaved and barely had any sauce on them.  The burger showed up with meat, cheese, and a bun.  I was graciously provided rubbery pickles but apparently lettuce and tomato aren't grown in this section of Scottsdale as they were noticably missing.  But lets get to the best part...the guacamole.  To say this stuff was brown and disgusting would be an insult to the Coach Purses and Skin of the Scottdale women everywhere.  This wasn't just a dusting of top that could be scraped off but was through and through this deliciously looking turd treat.   

Needless to say I'll never return to this culinary hell hole unless I lose a bet that will benefit special need puppies."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Exactly what we expected. Slow service on a Saturday at noon. Not really her fault as she was the only server/bartender and had a bar full of folks ordering drinks while we just had food/lunch and were not sitting at the bar. A man who seemed like he may be the owner or manager was very helpful when he was available. I would go back."}
{"text":"i sat down and my chair slid half way across the restaurant.  from now on, anytime I see wheels under chairs, i'm leaving.  bottom line with this place - i can't imagine why anyone would go here with zipp's in the same parking lot?  pizza was average and drink specials weren't very special.  blah!"}
{"text":"Was in last night and Mary - who's like the sun shining at night - warmed the room with her smile, attentiveness and sweet demeanor, making my list of favorite servers anywhere. Had 2 Stellas and their oh so unique Reuben egg rolls with 1,000 Island dip. Uh...yum? Good place to watch the game - or variety of games, that is - and mingle with locals. Lots of \"regular Joes\" and friendly people. I like."}
{"text":"We stopped at Clancy's for a pint the day of the Packers v. Cowboys playoff game, lured by the promise of it being an Irish Packers bar. Well, the Packers part is true enough, but no Irish pub worth its salt serves Guinness in a pitcher, even if it is the more economical option. Arthur is somewhere rolling in his grave. Friendly neighborhood spot, though."}
{"text":"Interior - Comfortable Pub.  The night I visited was trivia night and while not my thing quite a few tables were actively involved and looked to be having a good time.
Patio - Plenty of seating and heat lamps but seems to be a heavy smoking crowd, I was coughing up a lung the next morning...I'm sure that depends on the night and the crowd but a few fans strategically placed could mitigate that.
Service- Could have probably used one more server, or maybe the kitchen backed up.
Food - Ordered happy hour pizza, small but quite good and inexpensive. Thin cracker crust with the right amount of cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"Wth, our water and diet Pepsi glasses sat empty for like an hour.  Tried three times to ask for a refill and some nachos and she walks away every time.   Finally I'm ticked off and she asks if I'd like a refill.  I say yes and can we get.... Ignored again!  Either she's deaf or terrible at her job!"}
{"text":"Super fun happy hour spot.  Great food, cold beer, every game you could imagine on the TV's, yet we were still able to talk to each other and actually hear our own conversation.

PLUS!!!!"}
{"text":"One word, crap.  I'm a fan of local strip mall bars, but this place doesn't offer anything interesting of note.  The food is par for the course at best, the drinks are uninspiring, the decor is blah, and the service is just okay.  So you might think why not give it 3 stars... Well, unfortunately the clientele that frequent this place drag it down.  I've never seen so many mean, burnt out drunks so willing to pick a fight over nothing in my life.  A friend and I went in there, sat down, and ordered some drinks... a customer across the bar from us stared at me the entire time (literally, never took his eyes off me).  I got out my camera to take a happy little picture and the guy next to me asked me why I took a picture and then informed me he would be ramming the camera down my throat if I took another one.  That was my signal to leave the joint.  Zipps is so much more fun, lively, and enjoyable.  Maybe the nasty attitude is an Irish thing, who knows.  I won't be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Bartenders are nice and I have been there to enjoy their wings. Tonight they had lots of black pepper in the breading and when you want Buffalo wings, you're not looking to taste black pepper. The bartender was nice about it but the wings were disappointing. Not the same experience."}
{"text":"I came in the other night with my dad for a celebratory drink. Jessica - the bar tender - is ALWAYS so unfriendly, and tonight was no different... except I finally can't take it anymore and I'm writing a review. 

We ordered a pitcher of beer and she handed us two HOT - not warm, not kind of warm - straight up HOTTTTT glasses. They were downright undrinkable. I nicely ask her for new glasses, and without EVER even looking up or making eye contact with me - she rudely responds \"all I got\". 

I was in there trying to have one celebratory drink with my dad, and she couldn't take one second to address a very tiny concern. I understand being busy, or having a bad day, but every single time we are in there, she is rough-around-the-edges and unfriendly beyond belief. Just really sad to be such an angry person all the time, and even more sad Clancy's doesn't care more about their new customers."}
{"text":"Cool pub, great staff, good prices and surprisingly good food, was a nice treat. Went two days in a row and I'm sure I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"Looks:  Stripmall bar with a small outdoor patio.  Inside was dark with cheap furniture... your standard dive bar.

Crowd:  Must have been senior citizen night.  The place wreaked of despair.  Granted, it was Monday at 6pm.  I've heard the place gets a decent crowd on other nights.

Food:  We got 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich and they were all fairly awful.  The burgers were slightly overcooked, on big wonderbread buns fresh from the bag.  No lettuce or tomato.  The fries and tater tots were decent, though clearly not homemade.

Value:  Beers were very cheap during happy hour.  The food prices were about what you'd expect from a bar... maybe slightly higher.  The burgers were on special for $7.

Service:  Good.

Miscellaneous:  Beers were available in mini-pitchers, which I think is a nice touch.  The patio is dog friendly.

Verdict:  I'll never eat there again.  That's for sure.  It's an OK place to grab a beer, but there are lots of other (better) food & drink choices around this place."}
{"text":"Talk about warm to cold.   I've always tipped, been nice, etc.  all of a sudden I suck.  We not pleased."}
{"text":"The staff here is incredibly rude. I;d give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"OK. Not a bad bar...but it is definitely missing something. I am not sure what, I went here for a quick bite to eat before class at SCC and a quick drink with a friend.

The service was kind of slow. and the place was a bit a mess, I guess this is a great place if your a Scottsdale deuschbag. 

Me and my friend sat at the bar and listened to all the drunks talk about their most recent DUI and how it was not their fault and how they were about to go out to the car and commit another misdemeanor.

The food was mediocre, and my beer was slightly warm. Not real impressed, but willing to give this place one more chance before I write it off completely."}
{"text":"Clancy's might finally be the marquee to stick around this location.  My signage memory only goes as far back as Sunday's, and the one time I went in, I was probably the youngest person in there by 25 years- I wasn't their target demo.

One-Eyed Dog?  It's fine... but every single time I walked in there, weekday or weekend, there was Karaoke.  I'm all for hatcheting up a song, as I do a fairly awful version of \"Centerfold\" myself, but I don't want to sing it seven nights a week, and you can only hear \"Goodbye Earl\" done badly so many times.

Clancy's?  It's simple.  It's an Irish pub.  Food is a small notch above typical bar food, and the Nachos were surprisingly effective.  The pizza was reasonable, nothing special.  The burgers- I'm a fan.  Beer selection is decent, staff is more friendly than just about any in Scottsdale.  My friend took issue with his treatment by the ownership the last time there, but that's his cross to bear.  I guess they don't take kindly to Canadian Hockey fans during the Olympics threatening to commandeer the microphone to sing their national anthem.  Now THAT would have been some singing I'd have loved to hear.

It's a simple Irish Pub with simple bar food.  If you don't feel like an Old Town club but do feel like a drink, you can pull in, park, eat, drink, be treated well at the bar, converse, leave, and do so without any pain, then this is a solid place to do so.  In this area, sometimes simple is better."}
{"text":"Do not go when  Tracy  is there, single guy go for  football  ordered 4 small pitchers and charges me for 8 cmon. She tells  me I had 8 pitchers in 3 hours okay. I will refuse the bill when I have been a customer for over 2 years. will not go back when she is there."}
{"text":"Gotta say - if not for the speed of the kitchen, this place would get five stars.  Erika - who is one of the prettiest waitresses I've ever been served by, did a great job and the happy hour specials were legit.

The pizza, once I finally got it, was sadly undercooked - but the beer and number of happy hour options trump the couple minor mishaps.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Down right hole in the wall local bar.  

Not too much going on around in here, but looks like there's quite a bit of regulars.  Drinks came fast and easy and so did the food. I ordered some fries and they were decent.

Bartender was cool.  He seems to know a lot of the regulars, but was very social in general.  

If you're not used to local neighborhood bars I would not pick this place for a drink.  I myself don't mind since this place reminds me of the Midwest bars I used to attend. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and well managed. Decent bar food and pizza. Best Runza west of Lincoln on Husker days!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Waitress/Bartender was too busy playing on her phone, talking on her phone, and flirting with the bar patrons. We were the first lunch customers. Maybe 2 ppl at the bar. Our food sat for 5 minutes after the cook rang the \"order up\" bell. We waited 10-15 min for our check after we finished eating. Another 10 min before she ran the credit card and brought it back. I suggest the owner/manager be more aware on worker performance and customer satisfaction. She just lost two customers for good. We have been there maybe 4 or 5 times before. However, we will not return."}
{"text":"Walked into this pub after getting sick and tired of the horrible service and nasty food at Zipp's just a few doors down.

Good prices and food is much to my liking. I love the philly cheesesteaks and the prices are good.

Servers are always nice, attentive, and familiar with the menu. 

Will keep coming back! :)"}

{"text":"This place was pretty great to watch a packer game! The TVs out on the patio were fantatic given the good weather, and the service was spectacular given how busy they were! The staff was great at keeping our drinks full and the drink specials during game time were pretty good. Food was pretty average, but to be fair we only had the chicken strips. Definately plan on coming back for another game and trying out the pizza since that is what they seem to be known for"}
{"text":"My softball team & I frequent Zipps (next door) all the time on Wed nights, last night it was exceptionally crowded (maybe for Barrett Jackson/Phx Open?) so we went over to Clancy's. Clancy's was also super crowded but we snagged a table. Our waitress was super nice & attentive, everything came out pretty quick. We got a few pitchers of beer & some shots. I got a side of fries & potato skins and both were really good -- typical bar food, but what's not to like about that? Also, on Wed nights they have a burger special for $5. Someone in our group got it & it looked really good. I may have to get it next time. I felt weird cheating on my beloved Zipps, but Clancy's didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I am never the type of person to call people out... But I had the worst customer service  experience I've ever had at Clancy's... I tired calling at least 5 times for a to go order and ended up just walking in and sat at the bar for a good twenty minutes until I spoke with the bartender named Wendy.. I told her I've been trying to call to place a big to go order.. She then rolled her eyes and said \"YAH, we'll look around.\" She then asked me what I wanted and I asked her what was on the Irish nachos and she then grabbed a menu and slid it across the table and pointed to where the description was and stormed off angrily to assist someone else. I then figured out what I wanted and forgot one of the things I didn't want on it which ended up being black olives... But she stormed off once again for a good 15 minutes and I then asked her in a kind manor why they were short staffed on a Friday night. She then said \"I'm unsure  that's just how it is ok..\" And rolled her eyes for the 100th time. 

I absolutely cannot stand bad customer service so I then asked her why she was being so rude to me, she then told me to get out of the restaurant.... But 5 minutes later she came back and took my order.. I was honestly in complete shock that I was treated so terribly at Clancy's and I suggest the owner/manager be more aware of how Wendy is treating her customers because it was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"Had a great day with our fellow husker fans.   Service was exceptional and the food was great.   We spent a few hours there so we tried a few apps and a sandwich.   We had the Irish Nachos - tots at their finest, rueben eggrolls - tasty I must say.   Later we had a patty melt, good flavor - skinny fries.    The waitress mentioned they have add several new wait staff to their team.   If your looking for a Husker, packer, or other sports bar - give them a shot."}
{"text":"We only stopped by Clancy's to kill an hour and have a drink (or two).  The patio looked inviting, filled with people enjoy themselves. And, once it got dark, it was illuminated by christmas lights. I am a sucker for decorative lighting (hence the purple christmas lighting that I leave up year-round).  

Since we were only doing drinks though, we opted for the bar. I was satisfied with their well-stocked varieties of fruity flavored liquors.  I am a girl. I will admit it: I like  girly drinks.  I was immediately drawn to their \"cereal shooter\" menu, which included seven or eight shooters that mimicked cereal flavors.  I got the \"Trix\" flavor, which was Rumchata, raspberry vodka, orange vodka and blue curacao.  Although there are quite a few ingredients, the drink lives up to its name - it is a shooter - there is not much to savor.  However, it also really does taste like it promises, so I do recommend these if you like leftover sugary cereal milk.

The place is pretty small yet there were a lot of televisions.  This is a great thing if you love watching sports! I am not much of a sports person, so more reasoning why next time I will sit outside.

Towards the end of our hour, we were approached  by an angry man wearing sunglasses and talking loudly and rudely. We were oblivious that he was talking loudly and rudely to *us*.  It had something to do with his contempt for New York and itchiness. However, I don't mind a little drama when I am out and about, and the staff handled it really well. If anything, it was a bonding moment for us and the follow patrons at the bar.  Normal people unite!!

I would  go back to Clancy's (to order food and sit outside).  It had a good vibe, good staff and were not stingy with their Maraschino cherries at the bar."}
{"text":"Great TV viewing, sweet servers, great bar food, cold beer - AND it's a Packers Bar!  I love this place! The Reuben Rolls were delicious and the potato wedges were perfect for the third period. I want to come back and try the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Server Mary was great! There is a large selection of food items at a really fair price We sat on the outside patio which had plenty of TV's to watch all the NFL games. A little disappointed that at 2p on a Sunday (during Football season) they were out of a few types of draft beer. I partook in the Emerald Green Burger. It was very tasty  and cooked just right. The other people at my table ordered the French dip & the Salmon plate. The Salmon was a fail. It was overcooked and the sauce was bland."}
{"text":"The first time I have ever waited over an hour and a half for food. The owner snarled at us walking in, which is really sad as we came here for that packet hospitality we have grown accustomed to in our journey as fans."}
{"text":"I like Clancy's.  We play Wednesday softball and like to drink after.  We went to Clancy's last night (not for the first time).  It was very quiet, we had zero issue getting a table and a very attentive waitress.  The music was some 90s throwback so we were pleased with the ambiance.  They have reverse happy hour so we got plenty to drink for low $.  Wednesday's at Clancy's are great because of the $5 burger.  They have a \"4th of July cookout\" flavor and are very filling.  I would recommend Clancy's if you're looking for a chill, laid back place to grab a drink in the area.  A quieter option to the louder Zipps next door."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to come here every Saint Patrick's Day for their breakfast. Every year they have green eggs and ham complementary! I come here around 6 a.m. and there's already regulators they're starting their Saint Patrick's Day. I typically also attend their St Patrick's Day party or they block off a portion of the parking lot and have a huge party. It's always fun times here!"}
{"text":"Came here once before a few years ago and now remember why I haven't been back since.  Thank god for Yelp I can now check to see why I quit going here when I am curious years down the road. To start, Kelsey our waitress ... Was sitting with her neighbors while having us wait 15 minutes to order food after our appetizer was finished but the bartender let us know that It's okay because she's the owners future daughter in-law... Food was burnt and pure bland. My recommendation, never come here. You would think being related to the owner you'd have some sort of pride in your job, clearly she doesn't, which reflects on the other employees that made up excuses for the terrible service"}
{"text":"Great food and service at this pub. Host your event in the Jack room. Husker watch site as well!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Always got to love a nice dive bar that has a good menu and can pour a solid Guinness."}
{"text":"Stopped into Clancy's on my way home from work the other aftenoon for a couple of beers before home.  Went in and sat at the bar - sweet gal behind the bar came over and I ordered a bottle.  The beer was ice cold - just what I needed.  She asked if I was going to eat, I said no, but I'd like to peruse the menu.  She brought over a menu and I looked it over.  pretty much a little bit of everything, but it all sounded pretty good.  Come to find out that the new owners of this place have several of these establishments back in Omaha, Nebraska, and they do quite well - I'm sure this place will as well.  I'm always looking for a neighborhood place, I think I may have just found it ... I'll be back ... oh, by the way - bottles of beer were only $2 during happy hour ... I like that!  Give it a go ..."}
{"text":"I wouldnt TRULY say its as good as it gets, but Clancy's still deserves their 5 stars. 
If you are looking for a \"dive bar\" , low key, non-scottsdale type bar right in the middle of scottsdale, this is your place. Full menu, good food. Juke box. CHEAP drinks. Great beverage selection (i hate when I go to a bar and every type of liquor or flavor they dont have it). The wait staff is friendly. I'd say the only downside is if you are going to mingle or interact with anyone for entertainment, those chances are slim."}
{"text":"Normally go here on Wednesday for their $5.00 steak deal.  To be able to get a New Strip, small salad and fries for 5.44 it is a good deal. The drinks are high 2.00 for a soda or tea it a bit much so stick with water.  It is a total dive bar. 

Service:  Good."}
{"text":"I have to say how much I love to go to this place. I have been working in Scottsdale for 12 weeks, and I found my hockey home. It is easier to watch a game here than in the north. I come here to watch all of my Dallas Stars games. Thank you, yes they are Western conference champs. I will review them later 5*****. Lol. I have a great time here, though mainly because of the service. I am treated like a king from Wendie and the others. I love local bars that put my game on. This is the only place I feel welcomed in Scottsdale. This is the service industry bar in town which should tell you something. Go Stars and Go Wendie!!! The other bartenders are amazing too!! I have never had a bad night here!!!"}
{"text":"Had a breakfast sandwich, pretty tasty, good place to watch sports. Erika the bartender was efficient."}
{"text":"The food? Ok. The drink selection? Ok. But the service at this place, and specifically, that delivered by Tracey the bartender, garner a coveted 5-star rating from this yelper. The bar was busy enough to warrant 2 bartenders, but she really had everything covered. She even had the presence of mind to ask if I wanted her to put another drink order in for me before happy hour ended. Most people are immediately able to sense what a drunk I am, but unlike Tracey, few are willing and able to coddle my addiction so proactively. Great job Tracey, and great job Clancy's!"}
{"text":"OMG, upon entering this dark and dirty place with their plastic chairs, I knew I was in for trouble.  Only 2 tables with patrons at 12:30 pm lunch time.  Everyone there used a walker.  No offense, but that crowd is not exactly up on food typically.  Had to clean the chairs at my table before I could sit down.  I knew what the last people ate by their crumbs.  

Very bad menu.  Nothing authentic, nothing pub like.  Some phony fish and chip dish and nothing else but sandwiches, pizza, steak, sliders, artichoke dip, wings, wraps, quesadilla, etc.  You get my drift!  What pub serves pizza?  Definitely trying to please everyone and not pleasing anyone, I am sure.  At least not me.  Ordered the strip steak cuz it was the cheapest deal on the menu.  Not terrible actually at $4.99 with salad, potatoes and industrial dinner roll.  Knew I didn't want to spend anymore cuz it would be awful, so went with the value priced item so I wouldn't be too upset in the end.  My daughter had the sliders which were overcooked and dry.  The worst part were the french fries and tater tots.  Both totally dry, tasteless, industrial frozen version.   

BUT, the piece de resistance came when I asked for a box to wrap up my daughter's leftover sliders and after I put them in the container and was about to put them in a bag, I noticed the filthy black dots all over the take out container.  I was totally disgusted and needless to say, did not bring them home.  The waitress asked if I wanted another box.  Imagine, like I would eat that food if it changed boxes after touching this one!

I had to give it a 1 star, because there is no 0 star rating.  Stay clear folks!  It doesn't get any worse than this.

Oh yes, forgot to mention that this restaurant was the one that just encouraged me to sign on for a Yelp account tonight."}
{"text":"I'm from Nebraska and even though there are plenty of Husker bars around, I love this one the most.  The wait staff is great and the food is fantastic.  Prices are better than Max Grill too.  I recommend anyone who wants to come out and have a great time and not spend a fortune."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience last week at clancys ,we had been going weekly with our puppy , we liked to sit on patio, some very nice people and some not , just like everywhere, but the bartender scoulded us for the way we would order inside or out you have to do it her way, they must be doing very well to not want to take our money, so other places will, linda"}
{"text":"I had the most bizarre experience from the rudest bartender on the planet.

I went shopping at Macy's, then over to Pet smart for dog food.
I had just enough time to eat dinner at il Brioni which was excellent but only
Open for 30 minutes. I had veal and a glass of wine.

I noticed Clancy's was busy so I joined up with a group at the large outdoor
tables. After about 20 min I asked if they had a waitress and they said yeah but she's so slow its best to go in and order to bring outside.

I asked the waitress if she had Chardonnay and she said \"yeah, do you want a tab or is this to go?\".I said \" you sell wine to go?\". She said no, so then I thought I heard her wrong.

She proceeded to serve everyone shots and beers. I finally asked \"did you forget about the wine?\". She rudely said \" No, I'm not serving you\". I said \"for what reason, I'm not intoxicated!\". She said \" you were asking about it to go and I don't know you\". I said \"of course its not to go\". She said \" I don't care, I don't know you\". 
This sweet couple sitting next to me witnessed this and asked her if they could buy me one. She said \"NO, I'm not serving her\".

I went back outside to tell the people I met and they said her name is Tracy and nobody likes her. They said she'll serve people shots all night until they need a cab but won't serve a sober person one glass of wine!

Then I scanned the entire bar of 50 people and there was only one other female patron. It made sense then, she's a hormonal drama queen who's insecure.

Hopefully they go out of business!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out many fortnights ago, bartender screamed at me and my mate upon arrival. Food was garbage. It's a pub. Don't drink the water."}
{"text":"Decent local pub with a loyal following. This is really close to home but I rarely visit as it is typically slow with a half dozen regulars hanging out. I will be in to try the food soon though."}
{"text":"OK, this place is down the road from my place so it is convenient, which is the biggest draw. Also, the food is better than the atrocious Zips next door and the happy hour deals are awesome. For the most part the service is friendly and efficient, except for one Saturday night where the bartender cut off the girls in our group because they were getting too loud. Listen bitch, Clancy's is a bar, it is a Saturday night and they were 2 drinks deep. Wtf? Your job is to sell drinks and allow people to have a good time. You should be fired! 

Anyways I've been back since and not had a problem so I will go ahead and give it 3 stars. This place is also great for sports and is a huge Nebraska Cornhusker's bar. Go there on a Saturday in September to witness the debauchery if you can get a table. 

So, to wrap it up, go here if you want decent bar food, cheap drink prices for Scottsdale and a friendly atmosphere. I will be back."}
{"text":"If I could rate negative I would, the most racist and disrespectful place I have ever been . I am an American, and  just because my family is looks and are of Asian descent , they are Americans, they were discriminated on based on looks. This is disgusting! For an AMERICAN TO STATE THAT SHE HAS SERVED OUR COUNTY AND IS \"GOING TO KILL THOSE ASIANS\", BASED ON LOOKS, AND KNOWS NOTHING OF THEIR BACKGROUND IS DISGUSTING. What made everything even worse was that fact that the bartender just stood there and allowed it happen, then told us we needed to leave when I spoke up to defend our friends/family. Also, had the nerve to call the cops on us and say we were the causing problems. This is the reason our country is where it is today. I will never allow ANYONE to disrespect my family without me defending  innocence. They did nothing other than be of asian decent, and for Scottsdale PD to stand there and tell us we're being detained for trespassing, when we were the ones who asked for our bill and were wanting to leave In the first place is sick. For the cops to restrain  us from leaving & refuse me the right to go to the bathroom is just injustice, I asked if the female officer could escort me to the restroom and was refused of that right. It is p laces and people In official position as such that are an active disablement of what is going on in this sad place that we all call , \" The land of the free.\" Something needs to be done. Us \"AMERICANS\" need to stop placing judgement on our own people based on looks, but only look at ACTIONS FROM THE INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION . This needs to come from our PRESIDENT and leader first and foremost. For me and my family to be disrespected is such a DISGUSTING way makes me want to pursue legal action for the UNAMERICAN WAY THAT WE WERE TREATED. Also, both my husband an I gave our drivers license and on our paperwork an incorrect address was documented on something that is suppose to be a \" legal document \".Thank you Scottsdale PD for your attention to detail!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a dive bar. Our server was pretty sub par and the service was pretty slow. I felt the outdoor tables and chairs were pretty dirty. We ordered the wings and thankfully they were good! I recommend the charred style wings. 

I am visiting from Chicago and wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Saturday night my two friends and I decided to give Clancy's a shot because we love a good dive bar. We walked over after having our first round of drinks of the night (about 2 each). We were not drunk-not in the slightest. Two of us have worked in the restaurant industry for ten years now, including bartending, so we are great, easy going guests who tip well if the service is even just \"decent.\" As we were walking in, the woman behind the bar was talking to 2 other women at the bar who looked like they might be her friends.  I immediately noticed the absolutely disgusting looks that they gave us, and the obvious agitation from the bartender that she had to serve more customers. The place was less than half full, and it was around 9pm. So no, she wasn't busy, and it was not close to closing time. The second we sat down, before she even said hello, she decided that the man we were with was \"too drunk.\" He was clearly not, and I would absolutely not be offended IF he was, I understand the liabilities as a bartender. This was not the case. My friend, confused and taken aback, asked her if she was kidding, when she said no, he asked if he could at least sit with us while we had a drink. \"No, get out,\" was her response. It was the rudest experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  It is very obvious from the other reviews that you have a problem with your bartenders having SH!T attitudes, and customer service skills. Whoever owns this place should be embarrassed, you are letting your employees ruin your bar."}
{"text":"An awesome family owned establishment with good food and great prices. No Clancy's trip is complete until you do at least one shot of fireball and don't forget to try the weekly lunch specials. If you're looking for a nice non-douche bag neighborhood Scottsdale bar you found it!"}
{"text":"Was there a week ago and was treated so poorly by the big bouncer/bartender that coming back is a stretch.  If you are not a regular, friend of the staff, or die hard Nebraska fan, he made it known that you are not welcome with his service and attitude.  Good luck to the owners future success while employing such rude service in a service industry."}
{"text":"We headed back to the One Eyed Dog for some fish & chips with friends the other day and were very disappointed.

It seems that the One Eyed Dog is no longer and now the location is Clancy's Pub. The temporary sign does have a shamrock logo (which we thought may have indicated it was now an Irish bar - nope) and also reads Pizza & Grill.

While the decor is still similar and many of the staff have been retained the big change that disappointed us was a completely new menu. Gone are the English specialties such as shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, bangers beans & chips, Scotch eggs, etc. They've even done away with their excellent fish and chips preparation. To be fair, we didn't try the new twist. One of the big draws for us last visit was an interesting English menu with great execution.

Now the menu is quite bland and the execution wasn't great either.  Our table had a BLT (not bad), a burger and a couple of wraps. Nothing stood out. Nothing super interesting. No raves for any of the food. The menu now consists of burgers, sandwiches, salads, wraps, pizza, etc. The one thing that comes to mind is that they have tater tots. 

They've also eliminated some of the interesting beers (Boddington's, etc.) that were also a draw for us.

The staff were nice as before but we probably won't be back.

While some of it may be due to the change and the newness of the menu, I'd rather hit Zipp's next door whose execution of a similar menu is far better (in my opinion).

Might be great for some.  Just not our gig."}
{"text":"I'm going to say this straight up - I'm basing this review solely on their Saturdays in the fall.  That's right, I'm a Husker.  And I'm proud.  So there.

If you are a displaced Nebraska fan looking for a bar to watch the game at, Clancy's is the place to be.  They deck the entire place out so that you actually feel like you are in a bar on O Street back in Lincoln, and they serve the ever dangerous Husker Punch (well, they substitute vodka in for the Everclear we used in college, but that's probably a wise safety precaution on the part of the owners...).  

The food isn't the greatest, but it's typical of any bar food you'd find at a small bar and grill.  But like I said, I'm not reviewing the food, I'm reviewing the Game Day atmosphere.  The bartenders are attentive and polite, and I always feel right at home.  It honestly brings a bit of Nebraska to me in Arizona.

Word to the wise - if you are planning on heading out there on one of the aforementioned Saturdays, get there at least an hour before kick-off or you risk not having a place to sit."}
{"text":"If I can give - review, I would.
It is a rascist bar. As soon as walk we are called North Koreans & doesn't belong here. 
We walked in with a American & Mexican & told told them this.
The bartendar asked to leave after spending $139 than one person told us we are not allowed to leave than two said we need to leave. Than another lady at the bar said she will kill the asians. So my friends decided to stand up for us. The bartendar called the cops & said to the cops we are trashpassing. Sergent Thomas 1292 stated we had no right to be there. I don't know how people can be friends other than your own & be able to eat & drink at reataurant or a bar. 
If you are anything other than asian, you are not allowed!!!"}
{"text":"This place should get better reviews.  Have eaten here twice and solid food!  Plus friendly staff."}
{"text":"The drinks and service were awesome. The people watching was awesome. The food is not all that great, but you're probably drunk, so that doesn't matter... This is one of those wierd anomalies in Scottsdale that drew myself and friend to it instead of having to deal with the roofie date-rape scene in the surrounding bars (and there's 38+ bars in this neighborhood to avoid, just in case you're not interested in meeting and listening to 25-35 year-old douchebags talk about their stock options or the \"chick\" they almost bagged the night before.
The drinks were well-poured, the staff was really friendly, there were a few locals who were entertaining, and really, this was just a comfortable relaxing place to hang out for a couple hours. I'd totally come back."}
{"text":"Last night, we decided to go play trivia at Clancys. They're doing renovations so it was at their sister restaurant the Jack Room. Small but nice and clean venue. There are JD paraphernalia all around except by the bathroom where there are pics of Ireland. Doesn't really go with the JD theme but whatever. Kevin, the host of trivia had some awesome questions, not too hard but hard enough! Totally fun and he had a great personality. The service was a bit slow but those girls were awesome! They were working their asses off to serve around 50-60 people and they crushed it. They had to run next door every time someome ordered food to get it from the kitchen. Crazy! Really impressed. I'll definitely come back for trivia night!!"}
{"text":"NEBRASKA FANS UNITE!!!

This place is straight legit NE. Best place to watch CREIGHTON & Husker games as this place is owned by the same midwest family that owns the Clancys' locations in Omaha.

There's a group of Creighton alumni that get together for most of the basketball games... a rare finding in the wild wild southwest.

Parking is a kind of a problem in this strip mall.... so be prepared to circle the lot a few times~!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Super service and on Mother's Day! Sister had the Chilean sea bass, her favorite. I had the charbroiled oysters and a bowl of clam chowder. Sawdust on the floor and a generally happy place. Nice local atmosphere and ok to be casual. A nice mix."}
{"text":"Came here for the place claiming late nights when half the menu is sold out. Bartender went mia and was puking in the bathroom. Awesome. Eclectic crowd. Went for chicken tenders and tots. Was supposed to be buffalo but they were dry. It's a must miss. Sad to say."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, I came back again because one of my co-workers really loves their tater tots. This time the Guiness tap was working and they also had Harp so at least with that you can do a black and tan. I ordered a Guiness as well and they even made a little shamrock in the foam. I had to give them an extra star for that."}
{"text":"This was awful.  Bad music.
Smokers everywhere.
Limited menu.
Freezing inside, but smokers outside ruining your meal.
Only a view of the parking lot.
Ordered no onions. Got ALL the onions. (Meal was comped)
Super good salads.
No good beers on tap or bottle, so I ordered water.
Our server was excellent."}
