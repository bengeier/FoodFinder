{"text":"This place is exactly what you want from a coffee shop. My visits here, whether for coffee or lunch are are always great. Sometimes by the middle of the day on weekends, they run out of bakery stuff, which means no muffin or cookie with my drink. Their drinks are absolutely delicious. Why someone would go to Starbucks or Caribou Coffee while living in Stow/Hudson is beyond me.   I like that there is no music inside the coffee shop. This means I can spend time reading or chatting away with friends over a few cups of coffee without distractions. I love picking up library books from the Stow Library and brining them over here to read.   Try the pumpkin latte and Buckeye Mocha!"}
{"text":"I met someone here to discuss business. This place is spacious and has a welcoming atmosphere. The staff were friendly, the restroom clean and I ordered a chai tea latte and it was delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Coffee was hot and well brewed. Muffin was excellent. Staff was friendly and even recalled my preference for a mug when I returned later the same day. We need more independent coffee houses. This is one."}
{"text":"Great Coffee shop with a large selection of drinks and food. It's been here for a long time. I think Fat Cat Burger was there before them. A long time ago me and my band mates from The Plague had an interview there. Many pleasant memories and caffeine overloads."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the Buckeye Mocha Coffee Smoothie.  It's like a liquified Reese's Cup.    Why do people go to Starbucks for run-of-the-mill, boring drinks when you can support a local place and get better quality and flavor?"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mocha Joe's for a very long time - it used to be a high school hangout back in the day, and now I stop by when I'm in town visiting because the coffee is still as good as it was then. There's a large variety of drink choices, many of which are the same as they were back in the day. They make one of the best Buckeye Mocha's that I've had - better than any I've had in Columbus. This place is a staple in Stow and it's definitely worth checking out. It a nice quiet coffee house, one that has survived for many years and hasn't been run out by any of the coffee chains."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast sandwiches and smoothies, great Chai latte (my usual) and chess and board games to play while you sit on a couch. I love the chill, relaxing feel of this place, and it's in a convenient location with easy parking (unlike the Starbucks on State Rd)."}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE coffee shop. It has everything you need to get work done. It's spacious, calm, peaceful, the drinks (I always get a medium mocha) are so good that when I go anywhere else, it never tastes like Mocha Joe's. The staff members are always sweet, polite and have never once gotten my order incorrect. It feels like you are sitting in your own living room when you come in. Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee houses! Spacious, Good Beverages, Food and quiet. Personally, I really like the atmosphere over other coffee houses in the area. The WiFi is fairly fast and the service is quick and courteous. There is a small area to sit outside on the better days but I prefer the indoor space due to its comfort. I highly recommend trying this coffee house if you have not already. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seattle look, feel, price, and taste with half the benefits.   Tasty beverages, full Seattle pricing, with a punch card that will get you less than half a drink.   The full range of flavoring is available... the manager / owner had to search for Toasted Marshmallow, but it was there :-)   Hubby was very happy with his Vanilla Chai... they even proudly serve and sell Oregon brand Chai concentrate as well.   The flavoring pour on both drink was just right.   Hubby's large Chai and my XL Latte with flavor came to just over $9 with tax... so to get the $1.50 discount from using the punch card we will have spent a bit more than $36? Better than nothing.   The menu board is filled with all sorts of tempting Pannini, Breakfast Bagels, Muffins and more. Lemon bar anyone? :-)   Plenty of tables and outlets even if the chess table is full.   We will be back to try the sandwich offerings one of these fine weekends.   $ for breakfast, $$ for lunch."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Went here for business meeting. Place was quiet and large, food was great (had a turkey wrap) and coffee was yummy! Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Mocha Joes is a comfortable, affordable and unique coffee house. They offer a range of options and good food too!   They have a vanilla custard macchiato that is fantastic and their breakfast sandwiches and equally good. Not too mention, they have an awesomely unique layout to their shop. In one corner you have the counters and tables and in the other you have high back sitting chairs with book shelves and a fireplace! Very unique.   Also, much cheaper than their mainstream competitors. I do not know how long Mocha Joes has been around but they seem young.   The only complaint I have is that I've never heard them playing music so the atmosphere can be a bit quiet and boring if you're only in there to sit and sip your coffee (which is me most days).   Other than that, I thoroughly enjoy the visits."}
{"text":"I love the open space & abundant seating at Mocha Joe's, which feels much like its predecessor, Arabica. There's a small, dark corner near the restrooms that's perfect for spending hours on my laptop, & there are plenty of outlets along the walls for others like me to use. The space is clean & well-lit but not too bright or garish, & the whole place feels cozy despite being set in (& overlooking) a crummy Stow parking lot across from a Blockbuster.  But like another reviewer mentioned, the service wasn't particularly stellar. I accidentally ordered a \"grande\" drink, which is, of course, a Starbucks size, not a Mocha Joe's size, which the barista took pains to note for me, despite my obvious attempt to remedy the blooper. The barista who made my drink didn't understand it at first (a skim chai latte with a shot of espresso), but maybe it was because he didn't hear me the first time. Still, it was an awkward interaction, & I was happy to retreat to my corner to drink it instead of trying to speak with them any further.  Mocha Joe's is a nice space, though, a local place with a similar feel to Starbucks, though less corporate. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to study joint. Super friendly staff...the one girl even noticed that I came there often and didn't have one of their rewards cards (which I didn't know about) and gave me one and put a couple of stamps on there for me:) The paninis are good and so far I've enjoyed all the coffee choices except the 'Buckeye'. I know that's what they usually recommend to newcomers but it honestly didn't do much for me. Nevertheless, it's a good place to chill out, study, do the New York Times crossword with your boyfriend...whatever. Just keep in mind you won't be having a late-night rendezvous here because the latest they are ever open is 7pm.  Still a cozy place to become your favorite."}
{"text":"Another reviewer commented on the \"cold\" help here. I think the ice-queen is the owner. I was running errands and happened to be a couple of doors away from Mocha Joe's, and a quick look in my Entertainment Book brought forth a coupon for a BOGO offer on sandwiches. I presented the coupon to the cashier/sandwichmaker/barrista and asked if it would present any problems and was told no, and went about ordering a couple of sandwiches. To the dulcet tones of the owner bitching about the fact that I was doing so, and how if she had it to do over again she would never publish a coupon in the book and how \"we\" were all alike and blah blah blah. Well here's the skinny. The sandwiches were just barely worth their cost WITH the BOGO offer. All wrap and no filling. One was made with chicken salad, but not listed as such, (just as chicken), and it was totally flavorless.  Were it not for the consistency,combined with the absence of tuna flavor, I would never have known what I was eating.  This one ended up in the ash-can. The other actually had some flavor... the asian chicken wrap.   Had I not been verbally abused within earshot while patronizing this establishment, I probably would have returned at another time for another asian chicken wrap. After my rather unpleasant introduction to the place, i would probably drive 15 miles out of my way in order to secure like product in a like environ first! So.....Mrs. Mocha Joe if those of us who use coupons that YOU have PAID to have published in a book are \"alike\", it is likely that we have the common sense to not re-patronize your establishment after an encounter with you. My advice? Come back at days-end to count the register and clean the bathrooms and get a day job with the IRS.....they are always looking for people with your personality profile. Or maybe the informed patron should just bring a roll of duct tape here and put it to proper use, before placing one's order! I use these coupons as a way to check out a place and minimalize the investment, so I found out what I needed to know, ( I don't care to return), and did so at half-off.  Soooo if you're Jonesing for a shot of mother-in-law, and want a quick dose without the sticky repercussions, come to Mocha Joe's, but make sure you have a coupon in hand in order to get the full \"treatment!\"   Oh... and ask if that ham is ham or ham salad!"}
{"text":"As a graduate student, I am always in search of an oasis of decently priced java and a relatively quiet place to work. Enter Mocha Joes which is 5 minutes from my apartment and 10-15 min from Kent State campus. The place is quite large and has lots of outlets (also a big point for graduate students lugging laptops). If I don't want to work in my office on campus, Mocha Joes and/or Scribbles in Kent are the best places for me to put the head to the grindstone. They have plenty of comfy couches, tables, and chairs, as well as a fireplace.   The coffee selections seem endless as there are 3-4 boards worth of choices. This helps with my somewhat ever-changing mood and tastebuds. Somedays, it's a chai. On others, it's a cappucino. Both are done well here, and they don't burn their espresso beans (a HUGE pet peeve of mine with a certain gianormous chain).   The point off comes from the inconsistent service. A couple of girls that work at the front seem to have a little bit of a 'tude, but everytime it's been this one younger guy working there he is always super friendly.   If you're in the Stow/Kent area, and don't want to be surrounded by undergrads or want to get away from campus, I recommend trying Mocha Joe's."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite coffee place for years (through several changes in management/ownership). I never understand why it isn't packed. The coffee and the food is great, the place is big enough that you bring a group or sit in the corner and work and not be bothered."}
{"text":"The coffee is excellent and the crown top muffins are superb. Best chocolate scones in the area. The service is fast and the staff are always friendly. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the parking is ample."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time in the making. It's pretty long but very truthful, so I hope you find it informative.   I've been coming to Mocha Joe's on and off for about 15 years now, back then it was called Arabica. It's important to point that out because in those 15 years nothing has changed except the name. Well, they added a few shelves of knickknacks you can buy like baseball hats and bowls. It just seems gimmicky. Oh, you can also buy birthday cards there! Why not?  When you first walk in you'll notice a 'burnt French toast' smell, which has been there as long as I can remember. I've heard several customers say they 'love that smell', but when you've been coming here as long as I have, it gets old rather quickly.   Another thing that's annoying is their menu. I dare you to stare up at the 7 different boards and try to find something that jumps out at you, or sounds unique and appealing. I think they want to impress you by showing the many options you have, but instead it's boring and customers take a long time trying to figure out what to order. Having a large menu can be good if it's done correctly, for instance Muggswigz in Canton does it well... they have a huge menu of creative drinks their barista's personally invented and they list the ingredients, which makes you want to try them all! I just noticed Mocha Joe's is just now doing this with their Spring menu.  I might sound a little picky, but this review was 15 years in the making and this rant is warranted.  Next is their mini coffee board. Every coffee shop I've been to (which is a lot) usually has 4 or 5 types of coffee already brewed. That's another thing they've been consistent with, the same coffee brewed over and over again. Sure they'll switch up the flavors on you, but for the most part you're getting the same cycle all year round. If you look at the wooden bookshelf you'll see the coffee beans encased in a large plastic dispenser. I'm not sure how old that coffee is, but I don't see a lot of people buying it. This is not a place you want to go if you're a coffee connoisseur. They claim to roast their coffee in house, but I don't believe them... I bet it's all shipped in.  Other complaints:  -There are not a lot of outlets for you to plug in your laptop, which is just poor planning on their part. Go to Tree City Coffee in Kent and see how many outlets they have.   -The outdoor patio furniture is OLD! 15 year worn down plastic furniture you'd get at Big Lots.   -If you order anything under $1 you cannot pay with a credit card. I only point that out because that's never been a problem at other coffee shops.  -You'll always find the table closest to the cash register with a messy pile of newspapers spread all over the table.   -I went there on a Monday and they were closed at 7pm. What? Why so early? Maybe because very few people go there anymore.  In closing, I know I've been hard on this establishment but the owners NEED to hear it. From what I can tell it's the same people who've owned it all of these years. Now to give you my credentials, I've been going to coffee shops all over Ohio, and there are a lot of great ones: Muggswigz, Tree City, Angel Falls, Bent Tree... all of those coffee shops have creative menus, they take pride in the freshness of their coffee (many roast their coffees in house, weekly), they bring in a lot of local art, they bring in entertainment on weekends. In fact, most of those coffee shops are busy at ALL hours of the day... but not at Mocha Joe's. Honestly, it's really sad.  Now you might be wondering, if it sucks so bad then why do I keep coming back? Well it's close to my home, so when I'm in a rush I'll run in and get a cup of coffee to go. Other than that, I'd rather go to STARBUCKS! Yeah, I said it. You have to understand that back in the day this place was pretty fun, I knew a lot of the employees; they used to have live music, this place used to draw a great crowd.   At full capacity they can seat about 45-50 people, but yesterday I counted 6 customers. I personally feel that they've taken for granted their customers over the years. The owners just want to keep collecting money and not spend a dime to make this place different or fun. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are SO MANY OTHER coffee shops in the area that are amazing, don't waste your money here because they don't deserve it.  15 YEARS!!! What a shame.  PS.  This review is not directed at the employees. The students who work here are very helpful and friendly."}
